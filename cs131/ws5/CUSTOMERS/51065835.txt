This book reassured us because the boy in question exhibited far worse symptoms than any our son ever did or does.  He was able to train his behavior to the point where he appears utterly typical to the untrained eye.  Our son talks to himself and talks movies (script re-enactment) over and over.  We're allowing that, but we're trying to show him when it's not appropriate to act like that.   <br /> <br />No book will perfectly fit any family's circumstances and no book can promise to cure or even improve things.  This book, for us, lifted some of the grief by showing us that while autism is a life sentence, it is not a death sentence.  Our kids can make friends, engage in imaginative play, and get real jobs, too.  Sure, they may be quirky, but isn't it funny how we value quirkiness more as we age (particularly as compared to middle school)? <br />Anyways, this book gave some great ideas for encouraging kids to engage with other kids, initiate, and overcome some of the severe sensory issues autistic kids deal with.   <br />It's one more book for your library.  Parents of autistic kids remember:  you will find that you know more about autism and the ins and outs than your kids' teachers or doctors.  This is not so for cancer patients, or even those with broken legs.  We are the advocates for our kids and we're right here in the middle of a huge awareness epidemic.  Read everything and listen to your kids, even if they are nonverbal.	2005-05-15

I have two copies of this book.  I intend to underline and trash out one copy and have the other copy handy for the motivation, the heart-swelling angst, that this book inspires, if you call inspiration a knife in the chest. <br /> <br />I am now looking back to my first manuscript and I can suddenly see terrible insufficiencies, inadequacies, and things that just plain old need fixing. <br /> <br />I have to warn you that this book makes you so motivated to write that you can't read.  It has taken me days to get halfway through a book that should have taken hours to finish.  I read a page or so, slam the book down on the table and FUME over my main character's total lack (or insufficiency) of whatever noble characteristic I now believe he needs in order to be sympathetic. <br /> <br />It's rough. <br /> <br />Fortunately, I now have some grand ideas for the second manuscript (one-fourth completed), and the third manuscript (plotted out, but not 'written').  That's a good thing, right? <br /> <br />Need inspiration?  Need motivation?  Aspire to write the best damn book possible?  This book's what you want.  <br />  <br />Want to get something written?  Want to blurt and send?  Consider an idiot's guide instead. <br />	2004-12-27

It's finally here!<br /><br />How can I review the plot of this book when everyone already knows it so well?<br /><br />This is the magical book in the series where JK Rowling introduces the wizarding world and all the vocabulary that goes with it (Muggles, Quidditch, Owl Post...).  It's a treat to be able to read it in Irish, now.<br /><br />If you are still in the learning stages of your Irish, or are only three quarters of the way through Learning Irish by Michael O'Siadhail, try this:  read the Irish version of Harry Potter and have the English version right beside you.  It's easier than trying to reverse-conjugate so you can look up the root in the dictionary.  The only catch is you probably should have the ENGLISH version and not the American, since there are some differences, but those are only in word choice.  I'm using the American version, myself.<br /><br />This is a great tribute to a language that twirls out of your mouth and sings in the air.  I'm thrilled this book is out now.<br /><br />If you don't know any Irish at all, here's an idea or two for you.  Either get this book to motivate you to learn the language, or get this book to show your support for the dying languages of the world.	2004-10-20

I'm a married, thirty-odd, mother of two and I still found myself relating in multiple ways to this gay male perspective on life.  Some of the funniest scenes are described so well that they almost transfer into your memory banks and one day when you're 90, you're gonna go tell people that you lived in France and one night you were trying to drown a mouse in a bucket when a vanload of Dutch people pulled up and asked you directions. <br /> <br />And why not? <br /> <br />The stories Sedaris shares become your stories and your memories.

I'm not saying I believe in intelligent life, but moving on: This book deals with an unbelievable discovery.  This amazing meteorite with life in it is discovered.  Almost immediately, it is surrounded in secrecy so it can be adequately identified as such a profound scientific find.  If you know Dan Brown's books, you know that before anyone gets a nap something has come up.  In fact, during the next twenty-four hours or so, a whole lot of evidence points to something wrong with the meteorite, but I can't tell you that.<br /><br />It's a fun romp, more on the scientific side than Angels or Code, but that's what I dig, anyways.  I learned a bunch, as you always will reading Brown.<br /><br />An enjoyable, suspenseful, page-turner-and-a-half, I think you'll have a heck of a time reading this one.	2004-10-13

This book will not tolerate any namby pamby whining about not having time to write or having writer's block.  What this book will do is tell you how to have real, thick, believable characters.  It will tell you how to ratchet up every single scene, every bit of dialogue.  It will tell you that writing is a terrible occupation for those wishy-washy types who fly by the seat of their muse's pants.  It's a career.  Clock in, work, clock out.  Except you never really clock out.  Your mind leaves the room and you find yourself nodding to your husband that it's ok if he buys a new guitar because you're worrying about how to make your protagonist's girlfriend attempt to kill her boss. <br /> <br />In short, you won't need any other book on how to write if you've got this one.  It kicks you in the butt, tells you you can do it if you really really try and don't wimp out or run crying every time you get a rejection letter.  Instead, this book tells you, keep sending queries, and get going on the next book, and the one after that, too.  You could do some thirty odd books even if you wrote slowly but tried hard.  So quit whining!   <br /> <br />I love this book.  It's motivation without stroking.  It's advice without flowers and chocolates.  Get it if you're serious about that book sitting just to the left of your appendix (everyone says they've got a book in them, right?).	2004-10-05

Well, no.  You probably ought not LOVE a strict disciplinarian. This diet is quite popular right now.  It's a wonder, because it's really quite strict the first two weeks.  There's a huge payoff, though, and that's what keeps folks on the diet.  Four days in and I'm already down 4.5 pounds (but you're not supposed to weigh yourself...). That's quite a reward. <br />An interesting aspect about this diet is that you're allowed to make a mistake.  You're allowed to \\"quit\\" during the holidays. You just have to commit to going back to the beginning once you've indulged. <br />The doctor is a cardiologist.  Not former.  Not training.  A real cardiologist.  He just had trouble telling his patients how to diet.  The old high fiber (in bad carb form), low fat diets weren't really changing things.  Other diets have also pointed out the connection between diabetes and heart problems. So he created this diet to do something about it.   <br />To simplify, cut out refined stuff.  No refined sugar, no potatoes, no refined flour (remember, though, you can be human...). <br />The book recommends starting with the ultra-strict two week diet.  However, if you're not really interested in losing a pile of fat from your gut, I'd bet you could start with phase two or even phase three and still lose weight (or maintain) and at least improve your blood chemistry. <br /> <br />This is not a low carb, high fat diet.  It's a good carb, good fat diet. <br />Check it out.  It's an interesting read even if you decide it's not for you.  This is no fad; it's a look at what's to come in the world of nutrition.	2004-08-25

The photos are great, colorful, and depict babies doing real-life things. I also like Baby and Friends by the same company. <br />This has great pics of babies.  They usually even appear \\"real\\" in that they have messy hair, they slobber, you know, real. We like that.  The boys both clap when the baby claps and both give me a kiss (sigh...) when the babies kiss each other.  It's a good way to introduce what a book does (tells a story) and that books are fun to read.	2004-08-22

The book's too interesting, though, and I just had to finish it. <br />Now, I'm torn.  I will homeschool my children.  That, however, does not exempt me from caring about the education of my neighbor's kids or the kids who will eventually be driving and working and living near me. <br />So, what do I need to do?  <br />This book offers so many suggestions and demands for improvements that it's easy enough to write them down and mail the list off to your congresspeople.  It's not that hard to contact every member of your local school board and recommend these changes be put into effect.  A letter to the local school superintendent is a good idea. <br /> <br />Read this book.  If you've ever wondered what could be done about the constant news reports of kids not knowing where DC is or not knowing how to do addition without a calculator, read this book.  You will be horrified to find what the cause is. <br />It's not too little money.  It's not too little caring. <br /> <br />One note of caution: if your kids are in school now it will scare the stuffings out of you and not in a good way.	2004-08-22

This is such a great book to read to yourself and an even better book to read to your kids.  The imagery and the magic are great.  The Cloud Men and the rainbow paint are just imaginative enough for little kids to love.<br /><br />I docked the book a star painfully.  It was because Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is so much better than this and there has to be some kind of scale.<br /><br />James and the Giant Peach is a book you should read; it's a book that tops most peoples' kids' books of all time lists.	2004-08-22

My boys and I checked it out at the library and we've read it four times a day since.   <br />The illustrations are more silhouettes, really.  The time of day shows in the wonderfully rich colors of the background.  The babies and the hero kid are wonderfully edged; one of the babies pouts, later they're all crying (opened mouth and all), and it's all very detailed. <br />The adventure the children go on is detailed in a wonderful, fun-to-read rhyme.  My older boy asks for this book specifically and especially likes to look for the upside down baby (even at home...).   <br />The end is quieting and slow, just exactly perfect for getting your kid calmed down for bedtime.  <br /> <br />It's a wonderful story by the same author who did Good Night Gorilla. <br /> <br />Get this for the new mom you know, for your grandkids, for your own kids. It's a great way to introduce reading to your children.	2004-08-22

The rhyme is easy for kids to remember so it's fun to pause and let them say the word. <br />The storyline's interesting enough.  I love the dum ditty dum ditty dum dum dum.

It was fabulous, of course.  When we returned home we had a strong desire to replicate those meals.  We live in New Mexico, now, and at the time lived in West Texas.  I probably don't really need to describe the paucity of restaurants that would satisfy our needs. So, we went cookbook looking.   <br /> <br />We found this absolute treasure. We have made numerous dishes from this cookbook and loved them all. We have an absolute favorite. Dhaniya Murgh (Coriander Chicken) gets made in this house so much we both could do it without the instructions (and the instructions are complex). It's the dish we make in huge quantities and freeze.  It's the dish we serve company.   <br />The cookbook tells you about Indian cooking and how to mix what with what.  There are sections on lentils, on chicken, on meat.  You even get a recipe for making the strange cheeses and the wonderful raita that are served alongside the meals. <br />It's one of those cookbooks where you drool reading the recipes even if there's no picture right there (all pics are in the center). <br /> <br />One thing: the guy's pretty proud of all the people he knows.  He's a name dropper.  Funny thing, maybe because I'm only 31, but I know NONE of those people. Never heard of them.  Oh well, the man can cook AND he can teach you how, too. <br />My husband now experiments based on what he's learned from this book. <br />Want some adventure in your cooking?  Looking for Indian food that doesn't call for Cream of Chicken soup? This is the book!	2004-08-20

The kids make a timeline of major events in science history (invention of microscope; \\"discovery\\" of gravity, etc.).  We then head to the library for more books on the subject (ooh, dinosaur books...). Later, it's reports or dictation (again, based on grade level) and, after a couple of weeks, on to the next topic.<br /><br />This is a great science book to use as the basis of your curriculum because it's all there in one book. Rather than purchasing a different curriculum (with worksheets, etc.) for each grade, this book is used for all four years.  Greatly reduces your costs!<br /><br />Good book, well put-together.  See Well Trained Mind for more info on homeschooling your kid.<br /><br />If you're not homeschooling, this book is a great way to cement the cracks in the education your kids may be receiving.

In it you meet Jason Bourne, a lost man with a lost memory.  You follow him as he looks for and finds clues to his true identity. <br />It's as suspenseful as they come.  This hefty tome was one of those I absolutely inhaled.  I'm a woman, by the way.  If that matters.

If you're homeschooling, you'll find a way to get this one on your child's reading list.  If you're allowing the public schools to teach your kids, you'll hope they put this book on his reading list.  If they don't, you'll find a way to encourage him to read it, won't you?<br /><br />This is a perfect book for boys (oh, I'm a girl; girls will like it, too.).  If you've got a boy reader who just doesn't seem interested, try this book. This boy has to escape his father.  He gets lost in a cave.  He has a \\"girlfriend.\\"  They find a ton of money.  Adventures left and right.<br /><br />It's so much fun to read.  Twain really captures the feel of the time and the place, even if he has to use unfortunate language to do it.  Ignore the book ban-ers.  This is a book of our heritage as Americans.  We'll never be properly ashamed of what happened in our history if we're not allowed to read about it.<br /><br />At least read this one.	2004-08-18

My not-quite-three year old and I are, very casually, very much for fun, going through the book.  We are only on the fourth consonant (short vowels were first), but I can tell he's already starting to figure it out.  He blended the \\"se\\" set all by himself. I didn't prompt or anything and we were on a new page.  I don't call it reading but it's pretty exciting.   <br />I recommend only doing this for fun with a kid that young.  I ask if he wants to learn to read.  If he jumps in my lap, we do a page or so (kiss after every effort, right or wrong); if he says no then we just go on about our business.  I hope for a yes at least every day, though. <br />In the book, flipping ahead, it looks like by page 28 (we're on 12) he'll be reading several three letter words.  That's crazy.  That's like 14 days from now (instr. to mom in there, as well). <br />It's a lovely layout, if the graphics are a bit pixilated.  I like how great a value it is.  You also don't need cards, worksheets, pens, pencils, or anything.  I'm doing this the way WTM suggests and ignoring the bit about you can't proceed unless you can write the letter, too.  I'm not going to let low coordination in fine motor skills stop a kid from reading. <br />Other phonics programs cost way way way way more and have tons of little pieces and parts and tapes.  This is just a book and it blows all those other programs away. <br /> <br />Please remember to have fun teaching reading.  These are impressionable years for these early readers.	2004-08-18

Milton's Paradise Lost refers back; it's a classic.<br /><br />This book is rich in metaphor and symbolism.  The storyline is fantastic in nature; kids who find a whole other world.  All seven books amount to a full size book today, really.  It's not that much different in size from Harry Potter.<br /><br />This is a great story, well told, with characters that you truly are interested in and care about.<br /><br />You won't feel like it's too Christian (I'm NOT one) and you won't feel like it's too secular.

I would say, \\"stop reading this review and go read it,\\" but then you might scoff.  This is the origin of the kid-who's-painting-fence-and-tricks-others-to-do-it-for-him story.<br /><br />This is a great story of adventure and danger and the Nonesuch and all.  You've heard bits and pieces.  You've probably seen some movie version that butchered it all and blended Huck Finn with Tom Sawyer.  You really ought to take 4 hours out of your life and read this.<br /><br />You'll feel more American when you're done. You'll also be a bit disappointed in some of the uses of language, but that's alright.  It's part of that time period; it's part of that environment.	2004-08-18

I have run into words that I couldn't find in this book, though. However, if you are a serious student of any language you know that you can never make do with just one dictionary.  I typically have about three or four dictionaries per language.  Cross-reference your dictionaries to make sure you are getting the nuance you want from the word (I once heard a girl ask for \\"facil queso!\\"  No, no, no!(Sorry about the Spanish reference in the middle of an Irish review.  It's the point that counts, though.)). <br />This is a good dictionary for having on your shelf full of dictionaries.	2004-08-17

I just can't imagine ever saying \\"That goes down like the nun's knickers!\\" in a pub, no matter how strong the whiskey. <br />It is funny to see it laid out in Irish's horrific grammar. <br /> <br />Get this book to lighten you up a bit as you slosh through Learning Irish (the best Irish course out there).	2004-08-17

He steals money; he kidnaps fairies; his bodyguard causes bodily harm to people.  One of his redeeming character traits is that he's doing all this to find his lost-presumed-dead father and to save his out-to-lunch mother. When you realize this kid's practically an orphan who's looking for a way to help his family, it changes things. <br />However, he steals! And what he steals is a bad thing, at least according to the fairies. <br />The LEP-recon team sent to deal with Fowl wind up coming to an understanding with him in the long run.  They don't want him messing with them and revealing the secret of their as-yet-undetected inner Earth community and he just wants his mom and dad back. <br />The adventure in this book introduces you to the world Artemus lives in, introduces you to the faeries, and starts Artemus on the way towards saving his family.   <br />It's an easy read.  Artemus is very smart; quite unlike so many 12 year old kids (I mean genius...multiple languages, excellent math and analytical skills). The author does a good job of fleshing out his characters. <br />While great for all age groups, kids will like this more than adults.	2004-08-15

Along the way, she picks up Calvin, the popular cute, awkward, and largely-ignored-by-his-family basketball star.  They also meet three \\"witches,\\" of the non-pointed-hat variety.<br /><br />Magic stars in this book.  Science is important to the storyline, but magic holds the book.<br /><br />It is an interesting story about the very basic of battles between good and evil, and between freedom and security as well.<br /><br />Full of analogies to real life, this book inspires thought, provokes emotion, and fills the reader with a sense of wonder at the grandeosity of it all.<br /><br />Absolutely one of the best juvenile literature books out there, this book is a must-read for grownups, too.	2004-08-14

The storyline is both readily familiar and yet new.  The writing is crisp, fascinating, and infused with its own magic. <br />One of the neat aspects of this book is that the author periodically steps into the writing to tell you that Malory had this to say and, well, he says it better, so for more info on this, why don't you just go read his account of this part of the story.  Pretty interesting way to go about it.  Furthermore, occasionally the author likes to throw in complete anachronistic references, which usually made me laugh outright because they were so outrageous. <br />It's a fun book to read.  If you're finding this on your high school reading list, be not afraid.  It's interesting, the-opposite-of-stilted, and magical.  Also, it's easier to tell everyone apart because White takes the time to really develop the characters.  Sometimes Malory just throws them at you which makes it hard to distinguish who's who. <br />	2004-08-14

Judy Blume does a good job of developing her characters.  The storyline is interesting and appropriate for children. The book explores what children do, think, and feel.  The main character in the story, Peter, is one of my favorite kids from children's lit, right up there with James Henry Trotter from James and the Giant Peach. <br />This is another one of those books that you don't have to read before you die, but still, it'd be a shame to miss.	2004-08-14

It's just kids and what they do. <br />What a joy to read.  I love how Peter has all these conflicting emotions about his brother.  I love the scene where he returns from the school party and really has to go and....well, Fudge is in the way.   <br />It's a good story.  Blume's characters are well--developed.  The conflicts that do happen (Fudge in a commercial, for instance) are funny and not terrifying.  All in all, any parent should feel comfortable reading this book to their children or allowing their kids to read it themselves.  My sons are only 2.9 years and 1.3 years, so I haven't yet read it to them, but I will.	2004-08-14

These people are perfectly normal, intelligent, funny, interesting people set in a seemingly real town.  They are amazed by dry ice.  Things like this are totally believable.  And then, wham, a magic carpet ride.  It's amazing.  It's presented so straightforwardly that you begin to wonder, could that be real, too? <br />Like the ghost? Or the chaining up of father to the tree in the courtyard? All of these things have elements of reality to them, particularly having to pay a fee to ride on the carpet. <br /> <br />It's an amazing book full of conflict, family war, bitterness, joy, strange bedfellows, love, babies, more babies, and babies who nobody knows who the daddy is. <br />I read it and Oprah didn't tell me to read it either.  If you want a good book, this is a good book.  I would like to try it in Spanish some day. <br />	2004-08-14

I had been told by so many friends something along the lines of, \\"I can't believe you haven't read it; it's too funny.\\" So, I bought it and read it.  I had fun reading it.  I thought the puns were really cute and the storyline has just enough magic in it to make it lighthearted and fun.  I do, however, feel that there were times in the story were groans were more appropriate than chuckles.  Kinda like the guy who just can't help but make puns even if they're not really funny and maybe are even a bit too stretchy. <br />I bet kids as young as fifth grade could get this, but it's probably better for high school kids or middle school kids good in English. <br />When I asked friends for their, \\"Oh, you've just got to read your kids these stories\\" recommendations, this one came up numerous times.  Not as much as Wrinkle in Time, but frequently nevertheless. <br />It's a have fun with it story, and not an analyze it to death story.	2004-08-14

Sometimes you can almost feel the heat, hear the flies buzzing, smell the smoke from the burning buildings, hear ladies in fancy shoes schlooching through the mud. <br />This is an epic classic.  The story follows Scarlet, a hard-bitten-or-is-she Southern belle, as she goes about the process of living just before, during, and after the Civil War.  It's an amazing book for any number of reasons.  One, a woman writes about war and just about blows the socks off the idea that only men can do that.  Two, nearly every character you meet is a well-developed person, not just some caricature.  Three, details of life like cooking, nursing babies (yes, breastfeeding...), eating, dressing, flirting, dancing, everything is there.  I'm surprised there isn't any toilet scene, so much is covered here. Four, tragedies of every sort occur, from Scarlet and Rhett's love story to Scarlet and Ashley's love story to Scarlet and Melanie's friendship to the loss of Bonnie.  So many things happen. <br />If you ever thought that the Civil War was a right and just war and that the South got what it deserved, consider reading this just for the opportunity to challenge your conventions and long-held beliefs.	2004-08-14

One, it's got magic: a real, true, amazing bit of magic.  Two, it explores the friendship between two kids, complete with the sudden I-hate-yous and all.  Three, it presents children with some thought-provoking scenarios.  Should the children continue to make people until everybody has a wife, etc, or should the children return all the people to plastic after they've witnessed the real emotions and personalities of those people.  The book asks deep moral questions in a way that kids can handle. <br />This would be a great book to read aloud.

We are homeschooling and were looking for some more motivation (we'll take all we can get.). <br />This book puts forth the premise that the institution of schooling (and not teachers) are causing damage to our children in a number of ways including teaching them to know their place (not a good thing in my mind and certainly not in Gatto's), teaching confusion (ok, I'll teach you about Ben Franklin as we practice reading comprehension and the next teacher will talk about the Egyptians in discussing math and pyramids and your history teacher will tell you how Columbus was the first to set foot in America), to teaching that nothing's important (\\"I know I told you that fractions are important and that you need to pay attention and all, but the bell's rung, so get out of here and go to your next class, sorry if you're not done yet or if you're still confused.\\"). <br /> <br />In all, it's a moving portrayal by an award-laden teacher of our school system and all that is wrong with it. <br />My contention arises from the conclusion the reader almost has to draw: the dissolution of the public school system. <br />It is unrealistic to say, for instance, \\"ok, schools are a problem, shut them all down,\\" and then expect everything to start coming up roses.  So many people will be out of work, so many parents have to work and can't stay home with their kids.  Are we supposed to just let kids stay home alone and hope they teach themselves how to read and do lunch? <br /> <br />It's motivating for those who can have someone stay home and teach their own kids.  It's intriguing for those who wonder why so many of their friends say they haven't read a book since 10th grade.  It's powerful, but it's a pipe dream. <br /> <br />Read it because you want to know.	2004-08-13

We have fun with it, as should always be the case with reading.  My husband, in particular, seems to enjoy making an awful screech when reading the line \\"Piggie Pie.\\"  It took a while to notice some of the nods and homages to other stories.  It's fun to figure those out, too.  For instance, the skywriting is a direct reference to what the wicked witch writes in the movie classic \\"Wizard of Oz.\\"  In that instance, it's \\"Surrender Dorothy.\\"  In the book, it's \\"Surrender Piggies.\\"  Pretty cute reference.   <br />The rhyme will readily jump at you as being remembered from the Old MacDonald rhyme.  The illustrations are amazing: piggies with costumes on are too hilarious.  The dress-up is just bad enough you can't help but wonder about the daft old witch who doesn't even notice the pink snout on that duck. <br />It's a fun book.  It's probably better to wait till paper pages can be turned safely by baby hands, maybe 1.5 years.  But remember, a torn page is a small price to pay for literacy (Good quote, eh?  Got that one from A Well Trained Mind).	2004-08-13

I use this book to get someone else's view on certain grammar points.   <br />If you're going to learn a language I highly recommend that you first read How to Learn Any Language.  Once you've done that you'll find that a book like Irish Grammar easily fits into that learning framework.   <br />This book helps you to start to sort out why the Irish you've been reading in the newspaper is aranged the way it is.

It's easier to look up the original text than to check your dictionary.  You're likely to learn just as much that way.  I love reading these books in  other languages.  It takes me way longer, but it's fun to figure out what's being said and to chase down the sometimes inexplicable changes in translation.  It's a fun read.  It's an ok translation.  Like I said, sometimes it seems inexplicable why a phrase is turned the way it is (I swear there are at least two sentences that come off exactly the opposite of what's said in the original). <br /> <br />If you're an early Spanish reader/learner, give this book a try (Of course, start with Piedra Filosofal).  If you're an advanced Spanish speaker, you should really enjoy this.  Also, just between us, if you're an advanced Spanish reader/learner, try the Italian version, too.  Italian and Spanish are about 70% alike.  Get a dictionary (or try the method I described above) and just blaze through it. <br /> <br />It's a fun way to show your enthusiasm for the series.

I was also looking for a way to describe that information in Spanish rather than try myself.  This book does a good job of showing what different animals call home.  I like the illustrations.  The storyline always involves the children being in danger and the teacher being oblivious (or not) to that danger. <br />It's a fun way to add some Spanish vocabulary and learn some good science.  If you're a beginning Spanish learner, this may be quite helpful, along with a good dictionary.	2004-08-13

The rhyme is funny for kids and entertaining for grownups.  If you want to read a book with clever rhymes, here you go.  The only reason the book lost a star for me is that the plastic bug eyes get a bit scratched up after a while.  <br />My caution to you is that you can't really read this book while lying down as the eyes roll back.  It's kind of boring looking at white balls where the eyes should be.  You have to sit up.  I like to gently wiggle the book so the eyes roll all around while we're reading.  It makes the kids laugh and makes it look like the bug's really feeling what's being written. <br /> <br />All in all, a cute book, clever rhyme, outstanding illustrations, and a fun way to read with your kids.	2004-08-13

We learn in this book that evil has more than one way of surfacing, that Harry has special talents that few people have, and that Harry can handle himself under some intensely scary and difficult situations.  This book tells you that the series can go farther.  The book gets a bit darker, a bit scarier, and begins to reveal more about the darker side of the wizarding world.<br /><br />I think it's pretty obvious that if you've read the first one you should go ahead and read all of them.  Having said that, you may need more motivation.  It's quite a commitment, after all, and in some ways the first book was a bit \\"oh, that's why it's children's lit.\\"  I'm past 30.  I love the whole series, have read every book many times, including in other languages. I'm here to let you know that this book and the others in the series will have you wondering, \\"Is it possible?\\" Rowling (Pronounced \\"Rolling\\") writes so well, so convincingly, so truly, that you wonder if maybe there is some kid, perhaps with his name changed to protect his privacy, who has magic in him, goes into another world, and is the predestined hero of the whole world.  More so, the writing has you wondering, \\"Is there magic in me?\\"<br /><br />It's a great book. I also recommend the audio version.  Jim Dale's rendering of all the accents and speech patterns of the various characters is superb.	2004-08-13

My older boy loves dinosaurs, so it's nothing to have this book lying around for him to pick up.  Spanish and English have enough similarities that dinosaurs and dinosaurios are readily remembered. <br />I have always had one tiny problem with the whole series, including the English.  There are two text lines.  There's the story and then there's the set of dialogue in the pictures.  You seem to need to read both sets to get the full story, but it's hard to do read-aloud with these books.  Having said that, the books are great for kids to flip through and the science is good. <br />I like the series. I love it in Spanish. Use it to help your kids with a second language.	2004-08-13

I like that there's magic in a story about grown-ups (!).  I read this one quite quickly; it's one of those can't-put-it-down type books.  Because I'm a bookworm and a half, I really found myself relating to this heroine even more than the first book.  I really like how the resolution came about: quite a complex bit of magic, that. <br />It's a fun setting, it's a fun idea, and, if you don't concentrate too hard on some of the \\"that's impossible to believe\\" aspects of it (three strangers immediately best friends who go into business together...), then you'll have a great time reading this one.

Then, based on all your target language reading, you can decide which word is the best, most nuanced word to use in your situation. <br /> <br />This dictionary routinely had the most recognized words from my readings and conversations with native speakers.

We love the idea of standing back and watching kids grow and learn completely at their pace and in their own manner.  After all, they figured out how to roll over, stand up, walk, etc. at their own pace and without any intervention or instruction from us. <br />However, reading (not necessarily in this book) about children who do not figure out how to read until ten, eleven, or even twelve (with the argument \\"but then, man, what readers they are!\\"), is really quite upsetting.  And you can't intervene, even this once, because you could upset the self-esteem of the kids.   <br />I'm just not so sure about that.  Oh, math and cooking, history and computer games, those do seem to be great ways for kids to encounter the subject material and truly learn it out of fascination.  But not to be able to read for all those precious years?  I don't care how voracious you then turn out, you've missed quite a bit. <br />Having said that, unschooling figures into our curriculum plan in that the children have a say.  If they want more dinosaurs, so be it.  Worms are boring? Just one week, then. <br />It's an interesting book to read.  The author is powerfully enchanting and persuasive.  I don't mean to dismiss the book as a whole.  I intend only to warn against too much unschool.	2004-08-13

These magic school bus books in Spanish are a great way to hit so many important vocabulary words. <br />My son loves to flip through these.

The previous three books set the tone of the series, introduced you to the wizarding world, and introduced you to the main characters.  This book, the fourth in a series of seven intended books, is the book where the conflict begins.  It is this book that shows you that this series has a real villain and a really villainous villain at that.<br /><br />We are introduced to whole other aspects of the wizarding world: new schools, other cultures, ancient traditions, and we're shown what happens when kids start growing up.<br /><br />The tiniest beginnings of a spark between Hermione and Ron begin to show.  Harry proves he's adolescent as well.<br /><br />The whole story, from World Quidditch Cup beginning to end-of-TriWizard-Tournament ending is a pulsing, pounding story.  I had trouble setting it down.  I've read it numerous times (I'm over 30....).<br /><br />This series, and this book in particular, are perfectly toned for both adult and child (and tweeners, too.). I was actually startled to find the book is listed and stored in the juvenile section of my local bookstore.  Appalled, really.  I'm reading a kids' book?  Oh, well.  It's that good.  By the way, Grapes of Wrath is in the Juvenile section of my library, too, and I hardly think anyone would call that kiddie lit.<br /><br />Before you read this book, you ought to read the first three.

It's wonderfully illustrated; very realistic representations of various farm animals.

I like that even bats are represented kindly (not demonized), and that the animals are so distinct from each other (there aren't 4 duplicate dogs). I really like how the rhyme winds down at the end.  It really helps as a last or maybe next-to-last nighttime book. <br />It's a well done book with great illustrations.

I have read this numerous times (including in Spanish) and I am over 30 (if that matters). This story is particularly dark.  The whole premise of the book is that Harry is being sought by a known murderer (and one who, no less, betrayed Harry's parents and is the cause of their deaths). So much happens in this story to test Harry's resolve.  A pack of dementors--Azkaban prison's guards--surround the school in an attempt to catch the murderer (Sirius Black).  These guard cause Harry a tremendous amount of grief. <br />The storyline is fascinating. We get further background information on the wizarding world and, more importantly, on Harry. We are introduced to some new magic, new spells, and some new creatures. <br />This is the book that will show you that this series has the power, the strength, and the story to carry it through seven books.  <br /> <br />If you decide you cannot commit to seven books or to worrying about some kid you don't know, consider reading just this one--even if it is out of order--before you quit the whole series.

I live in the desert (well, technically...), so I'm particularly keen on teaching my boys about the desert.  I like that the books are in Spanish.

I read this in a day, then started Key of Knowledge.  The series has a hooking plot to it (not \\"hook\\"ing, but one that grabs you). Three strangers (all drop-dead gorgeous women) meet in what has to be called a castle. They soon are set upon a fantastic mission to discover the three \\"keys\\" that will release three demigoddesses.  The girls become fast friends, find love (and arguably, some great sex), and discover themselves in the process. <br />One interesting side note: I happen to be studying Gaelic (Irish) right now. Irish is very minimally (like, 4 words) sprinkled in the story.  I thought that was pretty neat. Irrelevant to a book review, maybe, but pretty neat.  <br />This book may tax your patience in the area of \\"oh, come ON! In just one month ALL that happens?\\" But if you willingly suspend your disbelief, and let the story flow, it's a fascinating storyline. <br />I had a ton of fun, even when the sex scenes were being read while I sat next to an old lady in the hospital waiting room....

Each page also reveals the noise that animal makes right along with the famous kids' song. The cutouts, hidden animals, escalating noise on the farm, and the farmer's increasing discomfort make for a fun read. At the very end, a whole new slew of animals and noises are presented, just in case you still have breath in you to keep on singing. <br />The illustrations are fantastic.  They are fun, colorful, and  present animals behaving in pretty funny ways. <br />This is a repeat read, as so many kids' books are.	2004-08-12

I've got it memorized (but that's not all that hard). The illustrations are the fat, sweet frogs, hippos, cats, etc. you know from Boynton's other books. This storyline encourages kids to join in and have fun rather than sitting out and feeling sad about it. I don't feel like it encourages this at the risk of damaging sensitive quiet types. Rather, I think it helps kids who look on and wish they could join in but just don't. <br />The rhyme is great and easy on your sanity.  The kids like the pictures (moose and goose at a restaurant?). The book's fun, interesting, readable (even repeatedly), and carries a good message for kids.	2004-08-12

We like this book because the rhyme is neat, it's a great way to really get to know one of your body parts, and because the illustrations are fun. I read this book pretty frequently. It's got a simple rhyme and clear graphics.  That makes it easier to point out pictures and help build vocabulary. The rhyme encourages kids to try to fill in the blank (if you give them one...).  <br />This is a simple, clear, well-illustrated book that makes it fun to learn where your eyes are and what they do.	2004-08-12

The focus of the board book is more a look at colors than the full version. We like to read this one quite a bit. When we go to the zoo, we like to say the title.  When we read the story, I like to pause to see if he can fill in a word or two.  My older one likes the story and likes to \\"read\\" it to himself (not even three).  The baby like to read it upside down.  It's a great storyline and a good moral at heart, too.  If you can call it a moral.  Anyways, the illustrations are neat because the children are very old-fashioned 50's or 60's looking children and the zoo police (or whatever they are) look old-timey, too.  It's a fun way to learn colors and to watch \\"magic\\" as the creature changes his colors for the delight of the children.	2004-08-12

We like to read this book to see all the silly animals (who wind up being toys) dancing the hokey pokey.  Beware, though.  By the time the book finishes, I am so caught up in the song that I just hafta do the final, ultra-dramatic \\"you do the hooooookey pokey...\\" dance number.  Of course, kids laugh at that kind of thing, so maybe it's not so bad.<br /><br />The book is great for teaching left and right (right wing in, right wing OUT  (teehee: get it?), for reinforcing body parts, and for reinforcing animal names.<br /><br />Have fun with this one.	2004-08-12

(Bright & Early Board Books(TM))	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Enjoyable counting game type board book	We like the rhyme and the storyline of this little book.  We like how the apples just do not look like they could possibly balance another moment.  The drawings are cute.  The competition is harmless.  The counting practice is helpful. this is a fun book that's a great read for toddlers and babies.	2004-08-11
US	51065835	R2XKHWTVMUMNGC	0843177098	687723968	Wee Sing The Ants Go Marching (board)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A fun way to practice counting skills	We like to sing through this book.  I like the fat-bodied ant drawings.  I like how easily the rhyme slips into song.  I remember this song well enough that it's not all that hard to remember the sing-song part of it.  My older boy loves the \\"hurrah hurrah\\" part of the song anyways.  Since we sing this song without the book frequently, he likes to sometimes do it differently and see pictures of the actions.  The little ant's a cutie.  This book's a winner and very much fun!	2004-08-11

The eyes roll up (they're weighted) and all you get is the \\"whites\\" of the eyes.  <br />Having said that, if you sit up with your kid and read, this is a great series of books to get into. I like to barely wiggle the book while reading so the eyes move about in silly ways. <br />The rhymes are great and engaging. The storyline is always cute.  In this book in particular the storyline has a redeeming moral value to it. <br />Brightly illustrated, the drawings do a great job of illustrating the action in the story AND finding a way to deal with the backsides of the holes the eyes go through. <br />Cute, Clever, Witty, and Worth it.	2004-08-11

My nearly-three \\"read\\" it so often that he wound up tearing a page.  We got it fixed up and then checked it out again.  Finally, we decided to buy it.  He loves the detailed drawings and illustrations. I like that there are lots of pages of drawings so he has something to look at for a good while.  It is a \\"real\\" book, so it's a little dangerous in toddler hands. If they enjoy dinosaurs, though, this one should take you through the years. There's enough science info to be interesting through the middle school years. <br />This book is a great addition to your dinosaur lover's library.	2004-08-11

I could read it to him and get him to say Uh Oh at the proper point.  Months later he was able to add Oh No at the proper point.  A book like this, with fun noises, great prepositional phrases, interesting drawings, a funny storyline, an exciting ending, and a repetitive reading sequence, really help children to remember what's going on.  A kid who can remember a story can eventually learn to tell you that story, and sometimes even do so long before they're truly reading and decoding the words. <br />The board book format will always be lauded in our household.  We like the durability and compactness of the books.  The babies can easily turn the pages, the books withstand being thrown (hey, it happens) and stepped on, and the pages can be gnawed on without too much harm. <br />This is one of our favorites.	2004-08-11

We like identifying the animals before and after they are busted out of jail by the mischievous little gorilla.  I love the scene where the only thing drawn on a pitch black background is the zookeeper's wife's eyes.  Too cute! <br />It's not really a reading book, per say, though.  It's fun to look at, but there are many pages with no words at all.  I still absolutely love the storyline and the artwork is lush.  i just thought you might want to know.  <br />We also like how the gorilla manages to escape again even after being returned to the zoo. <br />A very fun book, very clever, well-illustrated, and worth looking at again and again. <br /> <br />	2004-08-11

You really can't lie down and give this one a good read; the eyes roll back so the whites are showing. <br />We love the illustrations and the rhymes on this book. It's a really cute and fairly inventive storyline. I don't really like that sometimes the dinosaurs are called names.  \\"No more nut-brains da dada da da...\\" isn't really such a great thing to teach to kids.  I recognize that it's just a loooooooose translation of the scientific name (which is cleverly worked into the rhyme). <br />We have fun reading this book.  I like to barely jiggle the book while reading it so the eyes jump all over but you can still read the words. <br />In all, it's a fun series with a clever bit of artistry worked in.	2004-08-11

We have lots of fun reading this book.  I like to emphasize the strength it takes to turn the page and topple the brick wall, for instance.  It's probably better to read this during the day. At night you want quiet, calm-me-down books. This book is not that. <br />The only reason I docked it a star is because some of the pages are a little harder to read aloud because of the extra pleading and begging that Grover is doing.  Not a great reason, but it's not a story so much as a monologue. <br />I loved it as a kid and my children definitely like it now.  It's filled with interesting plot obstacles (which might make a post-modernist thrilled, by the way) and the artwork is bright and colorful. Some of the words are very comic-booky. <br /> <br />All in all, a fun romp!	2004-08-11

The bugs are three-d (for lack of better description) and are different looking.   <br />A fun aspect of this book is that while the story makes it sound as if the bugs were being eaten, they all seem to show back up at the end of the book.  I like the illustrations. They're very appropriate for small children and are brilliantly colored. <br />It's a fun book, easy enough to read (even over and over again), and it's a book that'll help with the practice of counting backwards.	2004-08-11

The backwards counting practice is great for learning numbers (instead of the typical everything gets added to kind of counting practice).  <br />It's a neat idea and introduces words kids don't get a lot of (speckled, for instance, and delicious). I also like how the frogs are actually all there in the end with just their little bubble eyes poking up out of the pool. <br />Great idea, masterfully done.  Pretty to look at and fun to hold.  My children seem to have to squish the cover a bit before we get on with the reading.	2004-08-11

They are simplified and generalized, which is perfect for children. I just point at the pictures and say the Spanish word. Usually, I also say the English word, but not always. We just slowly read through the book and then move on.  I don't focus on, \\"Here, kid, learn this other language,\\" or anything like that.  I treat it like it's just regular. <br />The series is a good series, too, by the way.  I think there are at least three other books.  <br />It's great for vocabulary building.  It's sturdy and durable.  Kids desperately want to help you turn the pages.  Let them! Just have plenty of scotch tape handy, OR, use board books (or both....)! <br />We like it; it's frequently revisited.	2004-08-11

We checked out the book and tape at the library.  A week later, I had the whole thing memorized.  When we got our own copy of the book, we unfortunately did not get the cassette.  Oh, well.  Like I said, I had it memorized.   <br />The boys simply demand it.  My older one, almost three, tells me, \\"you sing song,\\" and I know what he means.  The other day I sang the song and watched him turn the pages and stay on the right pages.  The cassette features several different singers using different styles of music to sing out the words of the fabulously popular book.  Sometimes there are sound effects, but usually not.   <br />It's a great way to reinforce the alphabet song.  Several letters are introduced by singing the alphabet song up to that letter and then some of the other songs seem to have the alphabet tune to them.   <br />The book has great graphics.  Of course it does, it's Seuss. But there again, these are great illustrations and are a great way to teach the alphabet and a tiny bit of phonics.  Phonics or whole word is not the focus, here. Rather, having fun with the alphabet, loving reading, and playing with words is what's going on here. <br />It's a great set.  Try to get the cassette version, if that's what you like.  We loved it!	2004-08-11

It's a great start and a wonderful way to introduce the characters, the setting, and the conflict.  The next books in the series are better in that they start to more fully develop the characters, intensify the danger, and darken the conflict. I have read this book many, many times, including reading it in other languages, and I am well into my 30's. It's a nice way to lose yourself for a few hours into a fantasy world that you can just almost believe is real.	2004-07-23

Alack, he has truly become a teenager. The character development in this series is why the books sell so well. This particular storyline is filled with such awful gut-wrenching occurrences that you begin to wonder why Harry tries at all. You feel sorry for the little dude. You empathize with him. This book shows his emotions trying to figure out how to be adult and how to stay a kid; shows his attitude needing some serious adjustment and showing the break from authority that seems to be necessary to become an independent free-thinking adult. It's a hard book to read and an even harder book to put down. I love the whole series and eagerly await the arrival of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.	2004-07-23

Man, I read this book cover to cover in just about two hours.  It was the advice, guidelines, and motivation I had been looking for.  Farber gives clear cut directions for choosing a language, choosing a learning text, and getting on with the learning of the language.  His advice on using hidden moments, when to listen and when to read the language, and so many other critical aspects of language learning were absolutely spot-on. I now have seven languages in my line-up (four already started) and am terribly excited about trying to learn a new language every year or so for the rest of my life. I was already a little motivated and somewhat interested before reading this book. Farber's enthusiastic support and advice just sent me through the roof. Come on, don't be a monolinguist!	2004-07-23

It might also be a good way to greatly improve your intermediate Spanish.  Keep a dictionary and a notepad handy for those new vocabulary words.  Or don't.  After a little while of recording new words, I finally quit and just read for the pleasure of it, deciphering words by context.  Sometimes I grabbed the English version to check a phrase. That worked well, too.  In short, for use as a language builder and confidence builder, I highly recommend this book to you.  However, if you're hoping to comprehend the complexities of grammar, there are just enough strange turns of phrase in this book that I would say this is not your first source for grammar lessons.	2004-07-23

Make sure you get the set with the tapes. Irish pronunciation is absolutely unconscionable. Fathomless, I tell you! Why on earth put all those letters in the middle or end of the word if you just already know you're not going to bother pronouncing them?? I digress. This book has one downfall. It teaches a little bit parts to whole. One lesson will tell you the vocabulary word &quot;say&quot; as in &quot;they say.&quot; Many lessons later you learn &quot;say&quot; as in &quot;I say.&quot; Rather than learning conjugation, you learn the word. HOWEVER, you do eventually learn conjugation (oh, dear, do you ever!), and you kinda hafta know some already conjugated words to make sentences more interesting than &quot;there is a dog.&quot; Irish grammar is freakish, even more so than the strange at-the-end-of-the-sentence-is-a-verb German. Sometimes to express an action you use the English &quot;to be&quot; (Ta). This book walks you through it all. I do every lesson, copy the vocab to cards, practice the cards all the time, and listen to the blasted cassettes every time I'm in the car. So, every now and then, I take my husband's car....Anyways, it's really quite intense. Do not enter into this lightly! This is a language in dire straits. You can become a speaker and help to keep it alive.	2004-07-23

This is one of the most requested books he has (out of hundreds). It's a great read-aloud book because there's enough room to point out the words while your kid is pointing at the pictures.

That's how potent the message is in this book. It has inspired me to join my public library friends program. Not only does the book compel you to want to read aloud to your children, it also offers a great reading list. More than just a simple list of books, this list provides suggestions for age range, a description of its topic, and even some slight comments on how to edit for read aloud. Also shifts a lot of the \\"what is wrong with our public schools\\" question right back in the laps of those who can do something to fix it--caregivers (be they parents, grandparents, or babysitters!!)	2004-04-29

Frankly, sometimes I've also been left worrying terribly about how far behind my kids are if they can't yet name the items at age 52 weeks like the author says they might. Overall though it's a great Preschool program to follow, very clearly laid out, and progressive in developmental expectations. It is the Preschool guide to follow if you're following the Well Trained Mind.	2004-04-29
