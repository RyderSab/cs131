US	52021908	R361DN9878YKOS	0553100874	270984394	Wicked Widow	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Wicked Widow	I was so excited when I found out Amanda Quick was coming out with a new novel.  Wicked Widow is wicked and brilliant.  I love her strong heroines and her powerful heroes.  Madeline is a widow who hires the services of  Artemis to help her find the man who's masquerading as her husband's ghost.  Artemis is at first unwilling to help her, and Madeline hates everything  Vanza.  But neither can deny the strong attraction they feel for each other  as they work together to solve the mystery of the man disguising himself as  his wife's dead husband.  Amanda Quick is brilliant in her work.  She takes  the subject of Vanza and makes each book different.  Each book gets better  and better. If I could cast this book, Madeline would be played by Gwyneth  Paltrow and Artemis by Billy Zane. What I like about Madeline-she is  strongwilled and very smart.What I fault about her-She does tend to be a  little dramatic. What I like about Artemis-He is powerful and smart.  What  I fault about him-He treats Madeline as a man treats a woman in those days.  He thinks she should sit at home and wait. Favorite scene with  Madeline-She and Short John are kidnapped and she is very strong in saving  herself and especially Short John.	2000-06-22

She is not afraid to speak her mind.  She falls head over heels in love with the handsome, Greek Dio without thinking.  When he whisks her away to his Island in  Greece, not only does he seduce her, she seduces him.  Their union is  shortlived when a jealous woman comes between them and Ellie becomes  pregnant.  Dio refuses to believe Ellie and defends the other woman.  Has  Ellie made a mistake in falling in love with Dio and has he made a mistake  in not believing her?  If I were to cast the book, Ellie would be played by  Angela Dotchin of Jack Of All Trades and Dio would be played by Maurice  Benard of General Hospital.  What I like about Ellie-she's tough and  vulnerable.  What I fault Ellie for-she doesn't think sometimes and jumps  too quickly into things.  What I like about Dio-he's a strong character,  very sexy and powerful.  What I fault Dio for-he's too stubborn and set in  his ways.  He has a big ego and he can be hurtful emotionally. Would I want  to be with Dio-God yes!  :) Favorite scene with Ellie-she is discovered by  Dio  behind his office door and she tries unsuccessfully to explain why she  was there.	2000-06-15

What I like about Tia is that she's strong and loving.  What I don't like about her is that she doesn't keep her promises and she hurts Taylor.  My favorite part is  the seduction scene with Weir to save her father beginning on page 1 and  returning to it on page 444.

What I liked about Joanne was that she was a strong and independent woman, yet vulnerable and very innocent.  She was a virgin.  What I didn't like about Joanne was that  she was not willing to take risks.  She was a loner because of her past.  My favorite scene with Joanne was when she was threatened and Hawk saved  her and admitted his love for her.  This begins on page 177.	2000-02-18

What I like about Gabrielle is that she's strong, passionate, adventurous, and very caring. What I don't like about Gabrielle is that she accused  Nathaniel of murdering her lover without knowing the truth. My favorite  part was when she warned Nathaniel about Talleyrand's letter, despite being  pregnant, and then they had to fight those after them aboard the ship along  the French coast.  This begins on page 411.	2000-01-19
