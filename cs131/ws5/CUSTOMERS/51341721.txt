It had an interesting plot involving genealogy and DNA (even though I had to keep referring to the family tree in the front of the book).  But I felt the author went a little over the top with \\"The Senator\\" character.  He was a man of no conscience or morals who had sex (willing or unwilling) with any woman within reach, left a string of illegitimate children, and committed incest on top of incest.  And no one called his hand.  Even if these things were not mentioned back in those days, I find it hard to believe that some of the families in this story wouldn't have done away with him before he reached old age.  I took away one star for Dan's parentage alone.  If you read the book, you'll know what I'm talking about.  Gross!  And the characters were all willing to live and let live until Carly shows up and stirs the pot. <br />Maybe it's just me, but it was just too much. <br /> <br />	2005-07-22

This reader is happy to report that Ms. Rob/Roberts is back on track with this installment of the In Death series.  The last book (SURVIVOR IN DEATH) had some issues that made the overall book--well--not so great.  But this one is perhaps one of the best in quite some time.  The plot was clever--a famous \\"saintly\\" doctor is murdered and it turns out he was involved in cloning, genetic manipulation, and other morally and legally questionable practices.  Throw in the now familiar cast of characters and a little on the home front, and we have a winner! <br />	2005-07-18

I almost didn't make it to the end, but I did--and save yourself the trouble--it wasn't worth it.  The hero and heroine were amoral, \\"do as I say and not as I do\\" characters who saw nothing wrong with orgies, pornography, or forgery. <br />And what was with the heroine's other family members?  An aunt/servant(?) who looked the other way no matter what her nieces did, including sexual misconduct and forgery.  One sister who lived in la-la land except when she chose to come out of it and make perfect sense.  One sister who was a cross-dresser.  And the youngest sister who was constantly being pulled out of trouble if the others cared enough to check on her.  I could go on with the problems in the book, but I think you get the gist. <br />	2005-06-27

I may be rating this book a little high, but the last couple of books I read were so mediocre that this one seemed great in comparison.  There are some excellent synopses already out there, so all I will add is that the heroine gets in over her head with a really bad bunch of people and the bad-boy hero gets her out; but not without some harrowing situations.  I really enjoyed this book.  The tension created made it hard to put down.	2005-05-25

It was a good idea--connecting the 3 different romance genres (regency/historical, contemporary, & futuristic) by writing around a common object (mysterious box) in the past, present, and future.  Unfortunately, the stories were mediocre at best, with the first one (Yesterday's Magic) being perhaps the best of the three.  This one is going in my discard pile.

Futuristic and sci-fi romance novels are my favorite genre, so I always start a new one with high expectations.  This one let me down.  It was heavy on the romance/sex (as in a Harlequin) and light on the sci-fi.  In fact, the \\"challenge\\" was just a small bit toward the end of the book, and not even that much of a challenge.  Should I change my mind and give it 3 stars for mediocre romance?  I think not, because it should have been more.	2005-04-12

Ms. Robb/Roberts has stated that the series would have to end if Eve and Roarke had a child.  Apparently, fans must still be clamoring for the blessed event. First we had Mavis getting pregnant rather quickly in her relationship.  Now we have Eve rejecting a child in the house, reaffirming that she is not ready to have a child. What else does the author have to do? --a baby for Peabody and McNabb? --Galahad turns out to be a female and has kittens?  I think this book suffered a little in the process of making a statement.  Eve came across as colder than usual and the action stalled until the end of the book.  Now that this is out of the way, perhaps the next installment will be a 5-star winner.  By the way--I, too, would like to see a baby for Eve and Roarke before the series ends.  There could be some great storylines around it. <br /> <br />	2005-02-18

Suzanne Brockmann has really opened a can of worms with this one.  Do you or do you not mix the gay with the hetero in romance novels?  I have no objection to the Jules character, but I was certainly not expecting such a heavy dose of his love life when I purchased this book.  Therefore, I subtracted 2 stars.  Perhaps he should have had his own book so readers would know what they were getting instead of mixing his story in with Cosmo's.   <br /> <br />	2005-01-31

(1) The cover leads you to believe this is one of Ms. Howard's serious thrillers.  WRONG.  It's a comedy.  (2) I thought I wasn't going to like the ditzy blonde first person style.  WRONG, again.  This book is hilarious.  I did have a couple of problems with the plot and subtracted a star.  Wyatt had stayed away from his soulmate for two years and only came running with an engagement ring when he thought she had been murdered.  How long would he have stayed away if nothing had happened to Blair?  Also, Blair was supposedly only a \\"dumb blonde\\" when it suited her.  But I question the intelligence of anyone who thinks someone who cuts her brake line is just stupid and someone who shoots her with intent to kill is just a nitwit.  I wonder if these things bothered anyone else.  Still, these problems did not take too much away from my enjoyment of the book.   <br />	2005-01-07

I hate to give a bad review to any new futuristic romance since it is my favorite genre and new ones are hard to find, but (you saw it coming, didn't you?) I simply didn't care for this one. <br />The plot was confusing.  I never figured out where the characters were coming from and; thus, none of them could ever really \\"grow\\" on me.  It's not the worst I have ever read and I DO like this genre, so I give it 1 extra star.	2004-12-28

I just got around to reading this book long after it was talked about by Kelly Ripa.  What a disappointment!  I expected more after all the hoop-la.

Thank goodness there is a star in between good and bad, because that's exactly where this book falls.

I was pleasantly surprised by this book after having read DAUGHTER OF DESTINY (2 stars for didn't like) and GET BLONDIE (3 stars for mediocre).  I was beginning to believe that the Bombshell series was going to \\"bomb.\\"  But this one is a different matter.  By now I guess readers have figured out that these are not typical romance novels.

I was also reminded of the movie \\"Miss Congeniality\\" when I read this book--beauty pageant world turns nasty.  But no one was hurt in the movie; even the violence at the end was slapstick comedy.  What bothered me about the book was that the mixture of silly romantic comedy and psychological thriller didn't work.  The ugly undertones and tragic climax did not fit the light \\"tone\\" of the book.  And the Epilogue went right back to silliness, as though nothing bad had happened.  I would have given it 3 stars up until the end.	2004-11-03

It will remind you a lot of the television series \\"Northern Exposure,\\" except Nate comes to small-town Alaska as Police Chief instead of a doctor.  You can actually take a cast list from the series and compare it to the characters in the book.  I also agree that Meg is not as likeable as most heroines, but then she had a jealous slut for a mother and father who went on permanent \\"walkabout.\\"  Hopefully, some of Nate's goodness will rub off on her.  I enjoyed this book; therefore, the length did not bother me as it did some readers.  Not the greatest, but then I only gave it 4 stars. <br />	2004-11-01

If you are a fan of the IN DEATH series like me, this will not be among your favorites.  It lacks the edge of a NAKED..., VENGEANCE..., or CONSPIRACY...for example (which are my personal favorites).  But still, we know the characters so well, that it is always a pleasure to get the new volume, sit back, and rejoin old friends.  I am interested to see how Ms. Robb/Roberts keeps this series going.  I believe she has stated that if all the issues were resolved, the series would end.  But to keep readers coming back for more, there still has to be new and exciting developments and plots.  This volume had nothing new to offer, and I can see how some readers are discouraged.  But I still enjoyed it.  Does this make sense to anyone out there? <br />	2004-08-13

I bought the first 4 books in the Bombshell Series, and this was the first one I read.  What a disappointing start!  I gave it 2 stars because although the author set up a pretty good plot, I just didn't care for what she did with it. It's always a bad sign when I start scanning through to get to the end, and that's what I did with this book.  Also, there is very little romance in this book.

It just wasn't very interesting in the beginning, and I didn't like the main characters (Angarred and Mathewar) all that much.  Also, the author went to a lot of trouble building two other characters, only to have them kill each other in the end.  I didn't GET that.

I have to agree with other reviewers that Ms. Crusie's last two efforts (BET ME and FAKING IT) have not been up to par with her usual standards of excellence.  Although the characters are likeable and there are some witty lines, the book lacks any kind of plot.  It consists mostly of couples pairing off in a singles bar.  It reminds me of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; meets &quot;The Dating Game&quot; (which is not a compliment since I don't care for either show).<BR>Also, I felt the author threw in some things to try to please everyone.  Min is overweight and carb conscious.  The bartender (who is also Cal's neighbor) is a Lesbian.  One couple decides to remain childless, which disappointed me because they both like children and it is pointed out a couple of times in the book that they would make beautiful children.  I will continue to read Ms. Crusie's books, but hope for better in the future.	2004-02-20

She has created this space ship with the ability to time travel, and hopes to go back in time and circumvent the Enemy.  A major stumbling block is that the ship can only go back in time and not forward.  We follow A. J. from leap to leap, picking up companions from each time she visits, and watching in dread as her health deteriorates with the abuse to her body.  An added complication occurs when one of her hitchhikers falls in love with her.  Just when you think she can go no further, the book ends--leaving them (literally) hanging in space.

She manages to get by until the disability is discovered and help is provided.  Her remaining undergraduate years are full of hard work, interrupted by field trips off planet where she gets into all sorts of trouble and winds up saving the day.  Told in the first person in a unique, disjointed style, I would also recommend this as a \\"young adult\\" novel.  There is no sex or extreme violence and only a mild romance thrown in at the end.

Okay, I really enjoyed the first two books in the series (SILVER PRINCESS, GOLDEN KNIGHT and THE HIDDEN REALMS).  We meet two of the four main characters in each of these books.  But the third book (DARK MIRROR, DARK DREAMS) was just confusing to me when the four characters were all mixed up together (and I DO mean mixed up).  I pretty much liked WIND WHISPERS, SHADOW SHOUTS because it separated the characters again.  It felt like a relief to me.  Now to GAME'S END.

Ms. Green has combined Alexia and Tiran from SILVER PRINCESS, GOLDEN KNIGHT and Chalaine and Bariden from THE HIDDEN REALMS.  It was hard enough keeping the shape-shifting couple separate from the magicians, but then they exchanged bodies.  These newly married couples were already having marital troubles, and then they started desiring the spouse of the other couple.  I just didn't like it.  So far, I have liked all the other books by Ms. Green.	2003-10-20

Personally, I prefer hardbacks to paperbacks when I intend to keep a book.  They are easier to read, and they are much more durable.  Yes, this one was a little pricy, but I will spend a little more for the hardback option.  As to content, I have enjoyed all of Ms. Green's books that I have read so far, and this one was no exception.  Ms. Green's characters always have some &quot;excellent adventures.&quot;  I have two complaints about the book:  (1) In the second part (The Argent Swords), too much time is spent on a repetitive argument that the heroine does not like to be forced into anything.  (2) Readers are left hanging at the end of the book, and one can only hope that the author finishes the story before too many years have gone by; or, even worse, that it is never finished like the the Far Side of Forever series.	2003-10-08

Part 2 takes the story in Part 1 into the future with a J. D. Robb &quot;Eve Dallas&quot; finale.  5 STARS for the setup alone!<br />As far as content goes, there is nothing new or exciting in the Nora Roberts half, although it is a still a good story.  Most J. D. Robb fans will acknowledge that the last few Eve Dallas stories have been a little lackluster.  We are hoping it is a buildup to new and better things for Eve and Roarke.  4 STARS.<br /><br />This makes my average rating 4.5 stars.  I had to go with 4 stars overall rather than 5, because the whole book lacks the tension or edginess that I like in a NR/JDR book.	2003-09-20

I recently discovered Sharon Green and bought a few of the older used books to start with.  This was my first, and I really enjoyed it--read it in one day.  I had some difficulty &quot;switching tracks&quot; from Jentris to Skyhawk, but I assume that was intentional on the author's part.  I will definitely keep reading Ms. Green's other books until I run across a bad one, which I don't anticipate.	2003-09-19

First, the idea of a tough female mercenary leading a daring rescue in Central America is a good idea; but Ray isn't so tough except for knowing some martial arts and the rescue isn't very dangerous.  Ray and Eli just fly in, grab Eli's brother, and fly out.  The only tension is sexual, wondering when and where it would finally happen.  Second, we already know from the cover of the book (notice the stork) that Ray turns up pregnant, which I don't mind in a story; but it was not \\"unexpected.\\"  Third (and last), we head on out to the ranch at the end.  It is too little and too late to turn this one into a Western.  Sorry, but I recommend avoiding this one entirely.	2003-09-19

Yes, this is an excellent series.  But in common with many other reviewers, I feel that there are too many story lines going on in GONE TOO FAR.  You never can settle back with the book, because it jumps around every few pages.  Also, this book keeps going back to previous books in the series.  I had trouble remembering who Ms. Brockman was talking about.  Maybe it would help to go back and read three or four of the previous books in the series prior to reading this one.  In any event, it was hard to get through the book.  I usually read a book in one sitting, but this one took me several days.  Hopefully, Ms. Brockmann's next one will be an improvement.	2003-09-17

I recall being disappointed that they would go to so much trouble to set up a luscious futuristic backdrop and then do nothing special with the plot.  But I decided to give them another chance when I saw this book.  Again, MARTIAN ROMANCE sets up all kinds of possibilities, and yet the authors do not take advantage of their own creation.  The plot reads like any other Harlequin romance (you know the type--all relationship).  I don't think I will be giving the Hoys another chance.  Too bad.	2003-09-05

I read the three books all together; and, therefore, did not have to wait years and years in between like others did.  Ms. Kirstein writes the Steerswoman into some great adventures, and those &quot;one-liners&quot; that she throws in had me laughing out loud and asking the closest family member to read that paragraph.  Wasn't it fun to see Steffie start to think like a Steersman?  I highly recommend these books and hope there are more to come.  The situation with the demons left a bad taste in my mouth.

This is certainly not her best book, but I still liked it.  Read it in one evening.  I have two reasons for holding back on that 5th star.  (1) I felt that the author threw in her whole bag of tricks--the FBI, the Mob, AND a serial killer.  (2) There was just enough goofiness to take away some of the menace of the serial killer.  While some readers may find these to be pluses, I found them to be minuses in this case.<BR>Since this is the first review of this book, I am anxious to see what others think.	2003-08-22

It has a lot of tension, both sexual and plot-wise, and the \\"bad boys\\" are (or were) REALLY bad boys!  Dillon seems to have gotten his act together over the years, although he is very gruff.  I do not agree with some readers that Dillon rapes Jamie.  It was NOT rape!  He would have stopped at any point he thought she was really unwilling.  Nate was the big question throughout the book, and I will not give it away.  This is a \\"dark\\" romance novel.  Don't expect fluff.  You won't find it here.	2003-08-19

As with the author's other two books, TRESPASS OF THE HEART and CHERISHED INVADER, I really liked SAVIOR IN TIME, but I cannot give it 5 stars.  Ms. Gail always seems to introduce a subplot or character that never goes anywhere.  In this book (since it travels back and forth in time) I can understand the changing sets of characters and plots, but it does get a little confusing.<BR>For example, there was a whole page put in about two little village girls who had absolutely no bearing on the story and made you think you had two more characters to keep up with.

This is a fairly good romance with amusing characters, but the plot that the author sets up never really develops.  Andie and Max are very likeable as new neighbors who are immediately attracted to each other.  Max pursues a reluctant Andie.  Sound familiar?  What bothers me is the things Ms. Gail starts and doesn't finish.  Max is a retired homicide detective, but the author doesn't use this to advantage.  Some intrigue at the hospital where Andie works fizzles out.  There is a wimpy stalker.  A deep, dark secret in Andie's former marriage that has left her so scarred, when finally revealed makes me ask:  is that all?  But most of all, why would a head nurse ignore a bad appendix until it becomes an emergency?  And why on earth would a surgeon have wanted to carve up Andie in surgery until Max threatened him?  What was that all about?  In other words, the romance is amusing, but don't look for much in the way of plot.	2003-07-22

Among other things it contains humans, human/plant hybrids, ant people, good wizards, bad wizards, spaceships, magic castles, time warps, romance, etc.  Spring (the human heroine) is a strong protagonist, but Herb is a bit wimpy as the half-human, half-plant hero.

I had trouble with the imagery of the Trident, Witness for the Telios, the Telios and their planet, and the garden on the spaceship.  Also, the characters didn't quite come to life for me.  If this is the beginning of a series, I will stay with it, though, and hope for the best.	2003-04-02

I didn't notice when I bought this book that it is a Harlequin. You can't tell from the cover.  I was pleasantly surprised when I read it.  Lots of times the plots in Harlequin romances are very shallow.  This one had a little bit more depth than usual--the heroine is a prison guard who allows her prisoner to escape and then follows him into the desert.  Things get pretty rough for them.

All of the characters in these books are likeable, but the plots are shallow.  One reviewer of the first installment (BLUE BAYOU) found a similarity to Nora Roberts/J. D. Robb.  This similarity is even more apparent in MAGNOLIA MOON.  Regan Hart is J. D. Robb's Eve Dallas down to the plain gray suit and the \\"Detective Cherie.\\"  Regan Hart is a poor substitute for the real Eve Dallas.

There's no real harm in this book; in fact, it appears a lot of readers liked it more than my 2 stars.  But after reading some really great steamy cajun romances by Sandra Brown, Nora Roberts, Linda Howard, Tami Hoag, etc., this one is shallow in comparison.

While Ms. Feather is a good writer, I DID NOT like the premise of this story.  The book begins with a vile act being committed on the heroine, and the \\"romance\\" is built on that.  What was done to Pippa was disgusting.  I didn't like the fact that Pippa and Lionel (who was involved in the rapes) were not even attracted to each other until this happened.  I call that perverted.  The secondary story about Robin and Luisa that was thrown in, I suppose for comic relief, did not work for me.  I didn't even like the ending.  It was totally unbelievable that Pippa and Lionel could live happily ever after with the consequences of this plot.	2003-03-14

I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but someone has to step forward with a true review of this book.  Come on people!  Why didn't somebody warn me before I paid what I did for this book?  At least I only bought the first book and not the rest of the series (shudder).  This book reminded me so much of one of those really bad Harlequins (you know the ones I'm talking about) that I turned back to the front to check the publication date.  I thought I had gotten a hold of a 1980's reprint or something.<BR>Let me be more specific.  <br />Charity Starr is supposed to be a brilliant Chemist/Astrophysicist, and yet she says and does the dumbest things throughout the whole book.  For example:  allowing her sleazy boss and dishonest co-worker access to her top secret, \\"dangerous if it gets in the wrong hands\\" project; constantly trying to escape protection even though she knows she is the target of a kidnapping plot, etc., etc.  During a fire in her lab I quote Charity on page 178:  \\"Irrationally she thought, Hawk's honey will melt if we don't get out of here.\\"  I couldn't believe it.  Once when Charity got mad at Hawk, she actually kicked him in the shin.  Wow!  <br />Just two more things that bothered me about this book (among many) and I will stop.  Charity used her ESP to find a dead body, and she was so upset that it turned her on and she had to have immediate sex with Hawk.  Hawk insists that Charity take one of his professional bodyguards with her, who then walks right into a trap and lets the kidnappers take her away.  I could go on and on, but you should get the idea.  This book is going right into the discard pile; and, again, I wish someone had told me.	2003-03-12

Ms. Dodd writes about a couple who were romantically involved in the past and broke up.  We meet up with them four years later.  It just didn't work in this case.

This book was a stretch to continue the story.  I had a hard time picturing Seth as an adult.  Also, to think that he would have kept paying his mother blackmail money over the years was ludicrous.

My only objection is the ending.  I went back and reread it several times to try to understand.  It seems to me that a sequel would have been in order.  There was a major skirmish with the enemy coming up, and the hero and heroine were trying to find a way to buck the system and be together.  I would have liked more from these characters.	2003-01-31

There just aren't many new books in the genre coming out, so I occasionally delve into the pure sci-fi genre looking for new material.  This is one of those instances when it worked for me.  The heroine of the story is a stalwart space ship captain trying to earn an honest living for her family.  Enter the tortured, misunderstood hero.

HOWEVER...<BR>the romance I was looking for never developed, and the things that were so funny in the first half of the book got old by the second half.  Down to 3 stars (which averages to a generous 4 stars).  I am always so disappointed when a promising book fizzles out at the end.  I seriously thought about giving it 3 stars overall.

He whisks her away on his spaceship to force her to see what the outside is really like.  From then on, I was a little disappointed.  There were no confrontations on the dangerous planet.  The space trip was too short for me.  And when they got back, they went on a spiritual pilgrimage.  The story kind of fizzled out.  The hidden rebels were not even there and the threatening Pharmons never attacked.  Maybe I'm so used to the violence in some futuristics and sci-fi's that I felt this story to be lacking in action.

I was sobbing by the middle of the book because of Sorcha's miseries.  A well-written book.  The characters are vivid.  My only complaint is that books of this type and length wear me out without a little &quot;comic relief&quot; (for want of a better term).	2002-06-25

Take your basic &quot;boy raised by wolves&quot; and &quot;father was an alien&quot; stories, combine them, and you get a very enjoyable book.  Lot of action.  Memorable characters.	2002-06-14

(I was a bit disappointed in that one.)  However, BREATHING ROOM is very enjoyable--more like what you expect from Ms Phillips.  If you haven't read Ms Phillips' previous books, do so immediately!  Most of them are 5 stars.	2002-06-14

For that reason, I enjoyed TAINTED TRAIL even though it did not have as much impact as the first book.  I kept wondering how much longer Ukiah and Max were going to run around in the wilderness searching for a missing girl before anything happened.  Does anyone feel the same way?  I would still read more books about Ukiah Oregon.	2002-06-14

I read WHEN DEMONS WALK first because it was easier to find, and I really enjoyed it.  So I started looking for a reasonably priced copy of STEAL THE DRAGON.  It is even better.  You can't go wrong with either of these books.	2002-05-04

I, too, would like to read more about Theodora and Ran.  I hated to have it end the way it did.  Don't be afraid to tackle this book, even if it's as big as WAR AND PEACE.  You'll like it.	2002-04-15

This couple's troubles went from start to finish, and I found it depressing.  A few lighter moments might have helped.  This was my first Shana Abe book.  I have another on order.  If the second one is not any better than the first, I'm afraid I won't be purchasing any more of Ms. Abe.	2002-03-22

The characters are so much more memorable than those in EDEN BURNING and DESERT RAIN.  (Don't waste your time reading those two.)  This one has a western flavor, and you will want to add it to your library so you can read it over and over again.	2002-03-20
US	51341721	R30PPA25NL2DBC	006621274X	30147767	Eden Burning: A Classic Love Story	Books	2	5	5	N	Y	Skip this one!	Not one of Ms. Lowell's better efforts.  I generously gave it 2 stars because it was slightly better than DESERT RAIN, which I generously gave 1 star).  If you're like me, you'll find yourself scanning through the pages just to get to the end.  Neither of the main characters are memorable or even believable.  Some readers may like the descriptions of Hawaii's flora and volcanic history--but not me.  It could not make up for the poor story line and weak characters.  BEAUTIFUL DREAMER is a much, much better book.  Try that one and give this one a bye.	2002-03-20

Sorry, but it's really bad.  Some of the lines are so bad that I blinked and read them again just to make sure it said what I thought it said.  The hero(?) hates beautiful models; so, of course, the heroine(?) is a beautiful model--except when she takes her makeup off.  Then she is so plain that he doesn't recognize her and is able to love her.  I might have liked her if she hadn't kept bragging on her own beauty.  Read it, if you don't believe me, but don't say I didn't warn you.	2002-02-26

I enjoyed this book, but readers should be aware that Ms. Hunter collects characters as she goes from book to book.  Therefore, I would advise reading them in order.	2002-02-13

This was a good book, but readers will soon become aware (if they are not already) that some of the characters had already been introduced in previous books.  Therefore, I recommend that Ms. Hunters books be read in order.	2002-02-13

The blend of futuristic romance, fantasy, and detective novel was just what I like!<BR>I hope the last sentence in the book means there is a sequel to come.	2001-10-16

I just had to rate this one 5 stars to cancel out the 1 star rating someone else gave it.  I liked SKYPIRATE, but this one is my favorite.  I wish more authors would write the futuristic plots.  There's just something sizzling about sex on a spaceship.	2001-05-11

While I did enjoy the plot and hearing from characters in a previous book, there was no happy ending to this book.  Nope, no boy gets girl.  There was nothing to relieve the stress of the story line.  Neither of the main characters (Sam and Nikki) came out a winner, and I felt badly for them.  Tami Hoag fans should, of course, read it; but don't expect to come away smiling after the last page is turned.	2000-11-30
