US	49202632	RWRC28FX61LXS	0425151867	399944420	Acceptable Risk	Books	4	2	3	N	N	very addicting	This book melded two things I never thought I'd see in one book.  The Salem Witch Trials and modern drug research.  Sounds a little weird at first, but Robin Cook makes it work. <br /> <br />Alot of mystery as well as some insight into the past of 17th century Salem, Ma make this a very engaging read.   <br /> <br />As with other books by Robin Cook, none of the characters is perfect which always makes his creations easier to relate to, no matter how rich, smart, etc, they may be. <br /> <br />Great read! Very exciting ending	2005-10-05

I just had a hard time getting into timeline.  I liked the premise and the setting of the book was really good, but I just found myself glazing over the words rather than truly absorbing them.  Rather than being on the edge of my seat waiting to see how it ended, I just couldn't wait for it to end so I could start another book. <br /> <br />As I said, hard to explain, but something missing from this one that I can't quite put a finger on.	2005-10-05
US	49202632	R32LW1HXIYP9PU	0425136191	422763605	Blindsight	Books	5	7	8	N	N	fantastic	I've been recommended Robin Cook before but this is the first time I've ever read one of his novels.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The book sucks you in from beginning to end.  The foreshadowing's all there, but it really doesn't become apparent just what's going on until near the end of the book, so it always keeps you interested and guessing.  The pages fly by with great action and character moments, and the characters themselves are fun to get involved with.  Also, the book never gets bogged down in too much medical explanation.  There's just enough to let the reader know what's going on, but you don't need a degree to understand what's being explained.	2005-08-20

I'm almost speechless after just having finished this book.  What can I say? Not only does it feature one of their best characters, if not one of the best characters I've ever had the pleasure of reading, Agent Pendergast, but it's a varitable who's who of Preston and Child novels.  Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil it, but let's just say there's a few surprises in this one.  Not only as far as characters go, but the story itself as well.   <br /> <br />And the ending...the last page alone is nearly worth the price of the entire book. <br /> <br />Preston and Child fans owe it to themselves to buy this book, as do fans of great writing.  Hands down, the best book I've read all year.	2005-06-28

Just like the first book in the series, The Flood expands on the colorful and exciting Halo universe.  In this edition, it's pretty much a novelization of Halo the game.  But it fleshes out behind the scenes parts that we didn't get to see in the game.  It chronicles all the events of the Master Cheif fighting for his life and the survival of humanity on the ring world as well as giving us moments with supporting cast, no matter how large or small.   <br /> <br />Despite having a different author than the fall of reach, elements of the first book play a part in this chapter as well. <br /> <br />Reading this book brought back all the memories I had of playing through and beating Halo the game for the first time and made me remember why I loved the game so much. <br /> <br />Although fans of the game might enjoy it more than people who haven't played the game, anyone that's a fan of good sci fi should check this book out.	2005-04-04

I heard some very good reviews as well as good word of mouth from a fellow follet fan. <br /> <br />I have to say that I just couldn't get into this book.  Normally there's a hook that just gets deep in you when reading one of his books and you can't put it down.  I just didn't get hooked.  I liked the idea of the book, especially the wintery setting, but  I just found myself casually reading through it...never 'having' to turn the next page or brimming with anticipation for the next time I'd get to pick it up and read more. <br /> <br />Not a bad book, overall.  just not one of Follett's better ones, in my opinion.	2005-02-14

As a stand alone story, it's good but I think it's better understood by a long time reader as it pulls in elements not only from the barrington series, but the holly barker series as well.  Elements of Orchid Blues, Blood Orchid, Dirty Work, The Short Forever are all melded into this book.   <br /> <br />I like that Holly Barker and Stone Barrington were together in this book as i like both of the characters.  I'm not sure about how holly was written in this one.  She's been written a little different than when she's in her stand alone books.  I think to tailor her more to the barrington type of atmosphere. <br /> <br />Anyway, good quick paced read.	2005-01-25

I liked the protagonist as well as the 'villains' of the book.  I didn't like the setting much though. <br /> <br />It takes place in Afghanistan during the early 80's when the locals are fighting against the russians for their freedom.  I'm not really interested in the area or the setting so maybe that had something to do with it. <br /> <br />I hate to say it but I had a hard time getting through this one.  The chapters were very long which didn't help much either. <br /> <br />There were some bright points to the book (as with all Follett books of course) but they didn't outweigh, what was to me, the boring story.	2004-11-09

Plenty of colorful characters abound as well, most of which are flawed..some more than others.  But I find that more interesting than the formulaic black and white of good vs. bad. <br /> <br />Stone has crises of conscience in this book.  Torn between what's right and what could make his life better.  This goes both with his personal life as well as his work. <br /> <br />The book reminds me a little of James Patterson's earlier work, before he became too formulaic. <br /> <br />Definetly a great read and I look forward to reading the rest in the series!	2004-10-26

You love to love the protagonists and love to hate the villains.   <br /> <br />What I liked about this book, and with most of Follett's books is that there's never an absolute good and bad. Everyone has their motivations for doing what they do and it makes everyone more beleivable.

I mention Preston and Child because like them, Rollins uses alot of different tools and settings in his stories.  They never stay rooted in one place, or cover just one theme. <br /> <br />And like Preston and Child, his books might seem a little 'out there', scientifically speaking, but he always bases his stories WITH science as a means of making them more beleivable. <br /> <br />Great action, lots of likeable (and loathesome) characters, some historical facts, science, comic releif, and romance make this book a definite great read.	2004-09-24
US	49202632	R2PZVYFIQK9TSZ	0312289588	284552075	Scarecrow	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Out of control!	This books is Reilly's most action packed to date.  Which is both good and bad.  Good for fans of that type of book and possibly bad for people who don't like such action heavy reading.  Even for a fan, some of it is a little TOO over the top, but that's what should be expected from a Matt Reilly novel.  Even the writer himself says how out of control his own books are! <br /> <br />Anyway, there's some big and I do mean BIG action sequences in this book.  There's a fair deal of jumping around between locations, but not to the point where you'll lose the gist of what's going on.  There's some familiar faces and some new faces.  And there's a BIG BIG BIG shocker in the story,  Which I won't spoil. <br /> <br />Definetly a good read for fans. Anyone who's not a fan of this genre or who like things more reality based that are interested in trying this one out, keep in mind that you have to take it for what it is, the equivalent of a summer blockbuster action movie.	2004-09-14

I've been a fan of Alten's for quite sometime, ever since I read MEG in a day a few years back.  That being said, I was a bit let down by this sequel to the very engrossing Domain. <br /> <br />It's been awhile since I read Domain but he does a good job of refreshing the reader's memory. <br /> <br />This book takes a very bizare turn from the events of the first book.  It gets even deeper into the Mayan prophesies of doom and legends.  Actually I think it gets TOO deeply involved in those things.   <br /> <br />I was a little confused while reading this book as well.  With all the flash backs and branching paths it takes I found it hard to follow.  That coupled with the fact that it takes rather large leaps into the future (in more than one way). <br /> <br />The book picks up in the latter half, probably about two thirds of the way through but not enough to warrent a higher rating.   <br /> <br />I've read some of the other reviews on here and have seen people state that maybe their expectations were a bit too high.  I think that was part of my problem as well.  After reading and enjoying all of his other works highly, I was really looking forward to this book and it didn't live up to my expectations. <br /> <br />I'm a little confused over the ending but it still has my interest up for reading the next part.	2004-09-08

I recently finished reading the Lord of the Rings trilogy and decided that maybe other fantasy works would be to my liking (the LOTR was my first exposure to fantasy).  I was in the R isle (looking for a james rollins book actually) and I noticed this one.  So I picked it up and finally got to it. <br /> <br />I was pleasantly surprised! It was a little slow to start but I got sucked into it soon enough.  It's much easier to get into and absorb than Tolkien's classic, that's for sure. <br /> <br />What I like about this book (this is my first Russell novel, by the way) is that even though it's a book of fantasy (or high fantasy and they're calling this type of book), the characters are beleivable.  He  doesn't get too much into goblins, orcs, trolls, giants and things of that nature...they're on the outter fringes of the book.  The story remains very human, with little smatterings of magic, demons, sorcery and the like.  Those things don't drive the story, but they certainly color it.   <br /> <br />In all honesty, reading this book I saw shades of Ken Follett's books.  As if I were reading one of his books set in a historical setting (Pillars of the Earth comes to mind, my favorite book E V E R). <br /> <br />Anyway, the ending leaves me wanting more and I plan on taking out the Isle of Battle as soon as I'm done two other books that I have borrowed from the library. <br /> <br />Sean Russell weaves a great story in this one.  I  highly recommend it.	2004-09-02

One thing I always love about Preston and Child is the intermingling of characters they use from previous books.  Pendergast, D'agosta as well as Laura Hayward from reliquary... <br /> <br />The way they make the characters leap off the page is almost magical.  That and the fact that no matter how off the wall some of their stories seem at first, there's always an explanation to bring it back to the real world...I couldn't put this one down... <br /> <br />Lots of action, great characterization and and ending that you won't beleive...	2004-08-24

Definetly worth looking into.	2004-08-19

This one takes place years after the last installment and revolves around, beleive it or not, reality television..I won't get into much more of the plot than that being that I don't like to put spoilers in my reviews. <br /> <br />All the favorite characters from the previous two books are there as well as some new faces, some that you love, some that you'll love to hate ( as with all alten novels). <br /> <br />Filled with lots of action, and some comic releif, this book is fast paced and well written as are all of Steve Alten's books. I couldn't put this one down!	2004-08-15

Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings)	Books	4	0	3	N	N	A tale of epic proportions	I've always been interested in reading the Trilogy but never got around to it until long after I saw all three of the movies.  If it weren't for the movies I may have never gotten around to it.<br /><br />This story is very sweeping in its scale and complexity.  Almost to a fault.  In fact, that's why it got a 4 (from me) instead of a 5.  The first 200 pages were difficult for me to get through.  But I persevered through them because I really wanted to see how closely the movies followed the source material.  And I have to say that Peter Jackson and company did a tremendous job of compiling everything and making a series of movies that remained true to the books.<br /><br />A problem I had with the book was the different speach patterns and mannerisms that the different characters/races used.  That as well as the intermingling of made up words and historical exposition that Tolkien put in the story to flesh out this world that he created from the ground up.  Alot of the history that he goes into really doesn't have much to do with the plot other than to give more substance to the world that he's trying to involve the reader in.<br /><br />After the first 200 pages is when the book picks up.  My recommendation to anyone who is contemplating putting the book down prior to getting past the first part of the book should keep reading on.  Once the fellowhship forms it really takes off.<br /><br />Took me awhile to read it, very heavy book and difficult at times, but anyone who's a fan of literature, or the movies, especially fantasy fans, should give this one a try.  This is the first book in the fantasy genre that I've read and now I'm interested in reading other books in that category.	2004-08-04

The first being Orchid Beach which was paced like lightning.  This one was a bit slower.<br />It reminded me of a Ken Follett book in that it spans over the course of many years, decades even, intermingling a central location and all the characters who populated that location over the years.<br />I thought the dialogue was a bit on the dry side.  Everyone had their own voice and I got the feeling from the style Woods used that people were indeed southern, but there wasn't that much personality to the characters.  In other words, I didn't get that much feeling of emotion from their words as I do other books.<br />The book is only about 427 pages long but it seemed like it was alot longer than that.<br />I liked the theme overall..I found the premise of the story very interesting.  But the pacing and the lack of focus or time spent on the 'main event' of the book (the common theme that drives the whole story and its characters through the years) kind of killed it for me.	2004-06-16

The dialogue flows pretty easily and the pacing was very fast.  I read the book in a couple of days.  Good action and plenty of twists and turns that I didn't see comming from start to finish.<br />Definetly worth a look for anyone who's a fan of good crime/mystery novels.  I'll definetly be reading Woods' other works!	2004-06-08

I've been a fan of preston and child books for some time now.  And I've managed to read their solo efforts as well.  While it was decent, Utopia just didn't live up to the previous efforts that child had worked on with his partner, douglas preston.  This book, however, was a great read from beginning to end.<br />It leans more on the technological side, but it doesn't get bogged down in the actual technology like utopia did.  The characters are great and there's alot of great twists and turns.<br />Definetly worth reading!	2004-06-01

When I read books like this, not only do I recall why I love to read, but I also remember why Follett's one of my favorite authors.  <br />Once again, Follett uses a real setting and occurence from history and works his story around it.  It gives the reader a better sense of immersion in the story as well as giving its characters a more beleivable air.  <br />I don't want to spoil the plot, but it has elements of the Borne Identity in it so for fans of that movie/book, this would definetly capture their interest.<br />This ranks right up there with my other favorites from Follett: Night Over Water, Dangerous Fortune, A Place Called Freedom...all of which are very close to Pillars of the Earth (the pinnacle of great storytelling in my opinion).<br />FANTASTIC!	2004-05-19
US	49202632	RC35DPFSK9QOX	0449227545	999720718	The Hammer of Eden	Books	4	3	3	N	N	very interesting story	THis is a slight departure from Follett's other books. It's not about a particular event in history, it's not a spy novel.  To be honest, it reminds me of a James Patterson cat and mouse type of book from his earlier days.<br />As usual, i won't give away any plot points other than a cop you can't help rooting for and a villain who you hate (but can sympathize with) match whits in a battle of high stakes!<br />The method of crime employed by the villain is odd at first, but as the chapters go by, the characters and events suck the reader in pretty strongly.<br />Definetly worth checking out.	2004-05-19

Even though I liked Angels and Demons as well as the Davinci Code, I wasn't expecting to like this book as much as I did.<br />From the prologue, through the first hundred pages, all the way to the very end, I felt as if my eyes couldn't read the words fast enough.  A really great hook that's not fully revealed until more than a fifth through the book, characters that you can't get enough of, and some great action really make this a must read in my opinion. The book is definetly well named!	2004-05-10

The book starts out on the slow side and there are alot of character to keep straight, but it keeps picking up and up and up with each chapter to the point where I couldn't read the pages fast enough!<br />The ending really left me wanting more. So far, this is my favorite of his WW2 military style books. Not quite as good as flight over water, a place called freedom, dangerous fortune or especially pillars, but it's definetly up there as one of my favorites.	2004-04-29

So I was worried that this being only one half of the team would give the book the same fate as utopia..<br />not so! from start to finish the book sucked me in with an interesting situation, great characters and a very vivid setting..<br />if you've read any james rollins books (subteranean, amazonia) and liked them, this book will be right up your alley.	2004-04-16

He has an uncanny ability to use real settings in historical times as a backdrop for rich, entertaining characters.<br />As with any follett book, the characters are what drives the story.  This is a story of people who seemingly have nothing to do with each other.  The reader will see, as the story progresses, that all the people in the book are tied together in ways they can't possibly imagine.<br />Each character is beautifully written as are the various relationships that form throughout the book.  And the ending! Talk about a page turner.<br />I've read many of Follett's books and this one is definetly up there with A Dangerous Fortune.  It might not be as majestic as Pillars of the Earth (my personal favorite Follett book and my favorite overall book that I've ever read to date), but it's just as entertaining.	2003-12-23

At some times I found it a little hard to follow.  There's several names and factions from different countries going back and forth.  But the ending is as good as any slam bang ending from a spy/action novel as you'll get.  Great action once again.  <br />Follett has a talent for weaving fictional characters and stories around real life events and places.  This book is no exception.  While  not my favorite of Follett's various works, this is definetly a solid read that's worth a look.	2003-12-09

Pillars of the Earth was the first and my favorite.  This, while not as great as Pillars, is still a very entertaining read.<br />One thing I enjoy about his books is how he can use real events in history and real places  in the world and weave them into his stories.  The history doesn't overpower the underlying story though.  At times you can think that you're reading an actual account of someone who was there, going through what the characters go through.<br />With very deep and true to life characters and a villain you love to hate, you can't go wrong.  A great book for Follett fans and those who aren't familiar with his work alike!	2003-12-01

Without a doubt, the man known only as Pendergast is one of the most interesting characters I've come across over the years.  The fact that he's a repeating character in the Preston and Child books only makes him more interesting because each book he's in gives you a bit more insight as to what makes him tick.  <br />This book is a really good read, with great characters, an interesting plot, a great protagonist in Pendergast and some really big twists.  Anyone into mysteries will enjoy this book.  And because Pendergast is in it, it should be a treat for any Preston and Child fan.  The reader gets some more glimpses of what type of man he is, but even more questions are raised about him and his past.  Which makes me wait with baited breath for the next one he may appear in.<br />Definetly worth checking out with an ending that'll have you saying 'Ohhh!!! I get it!'	2003-11-20

The first was Pillars of the Earth, followed by A Place CAlled Freedom, followed by A Dangerous Fortune.  <br />While I didn't like this one as much as the others it was still a good read.  Strong characters, a villain you love to hate, true to life situations and relationships all make this book an interesting one.  <br />The setting and circumstances are very plausible.  Could the success or failure of one of Hitler's most trusted spies turn the tides of the second world war?<br />The ending was definetly worth the whole entire read.  I recommend this one for spy thriller and follett fans alike.	2003-11-06

It all started with Pillars of the Earth, the best book I've ever read.  I read A placed Called Freedom right after that and enjoyed that alot as well. And I just got finished with A Dangerous Fortune.  I can't possibly say enough good things about Ken Follett.  Once again, it's the characters that drive the book.  He takes you on a journey with these characters through many years of their lives and you get to see how they encounter, react and truimph over adversity.  I don't want to give away any spoilers, but this is another 'must read' in my opinion.  His characters are varied and colorful and the relationships, from friendship to love, villainy and hatred are so genuine I couldn't help but wish that these people lived at that point in history.  A wonderful read that I will no doubt enjoy again in the future.	2003-10-29

Actually, this is only the third review I've written out of the 60 to 70 books I've read over the past couple years but I find myself wanting to express my opinions more and more when I get done with a great read and maybe helping people get exposed to great books they otherwise wouldn't have tried or known about.<br />While not as wonderful as Pillars of the Earth (I still can't get that book out of my head...definetly one of the best if not THE best I've ever read), this is still a great book.  The book has rapid fire pacing but doesn't sacrifice on the details and characterization that suck you into the book.  And that's what the focal point of the book is, the characters.  You feel their pain, their joy, every emotion that they're going through.  <br />From Scotland, to London, to Virginia, the reader is taken on a journey of treachery, deceit, love, loss and triumph.   You feel as if you can reach out and touch the characters.<br />Follett is fast becomming one of my favorite authors and he's edging his way to the top of the list.  You won't want to stop reading this book.  I could have easily read it in a day but I decided to stretch it out over a couple days and let each section I read sink in.  I don't think I've encountered another author who can weave romance, violence, humor, action and great research as effectively as Ken Follett and this book does all that.	2003-10-22

I've read my fair share of books in my day, most of them good thankfully.  I have to say that this is single handedly the best book I've ever read.<br />I just finished it and the next day it's still fresh in my head.  It's a long read at nearly 1,000 pages, but between the pacing and the engaging story 1,000 seems too short!<br />The vivid detail of the settings and chararacterization that you feel as if you could reach out and touch are consuming to say the least.  In fact, the characters feel so real that I found myself wishing that these people actually lived.  It'll make you smile, it'll make you sad and it'll definetly pull your heart strings.  <br />The reader is put on a long journey through the lives of many people, all of which have destinies that will be related at some point or another.  Those who you think are the main focus of the book at the onset aren't necissarily and those who you think are just minor players become more and more significant as the chapters fly by.  Nothing in this book is insignificant. From phillip, to tom, to jack, to aliena, to william...an amazing cast of characters is what this book is really all about.  The building of a cathedral is more or less the glue that keeps all these people's life paths intermixed, but it's the characters that drive the book.<br />I don't want to go into too much detail.  Any spoilers would ruin the experience.  And it is an experience.  It's a peice of literature folks, not just another enjoyable peice of fiction. A masterpeice.  One I'm sure I'll read again and again.	2003-10-16
