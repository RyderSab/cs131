Once again, the authors' knowledge of the subject shines through, and they don't shy away from the complexities and legal ramifications of various situations.  The book focuses on the West's responses, with Chapter 1 giving an overview of the world situation, and a chapter each devoted to specific countries: Britain, the US, Israel, West Germany, Holland, France, Italy, and Spain.  The final two chapters deal with private enterprise's response to the kidnapping of employees overseas and the problems democracies face in balancing harsh measures to combat terrorists with the civil liberties of its citizens.  While the book is rather optimistic in tone, it's final chapter does acknowledge areas of concern, such as nuclear proliferation and the emergence of government-sanctioned state terror.<br />Like their previous book, this is also an essential read.  My only complaints are that this book is riddled with typographical errors and that the index is not as comprehensive as it could have been.	2004-07-16

Reading the novel, however, was somewhat of a letdown, and I got the feeling that Peckinpah bought the rights because he saw what he could do with the story, much like Hitchcock would sometimes turn a second-rate novel into a first-rate movie (FRENZY, for example).  It's been a couple decades since I've seen the movie, but there seem to be considerable differences between it and the novel and, despite the flaws of the film version, I would definitely say that this is one of the few cases where the visual image is superior to the written word (e.g., THEY SHOOT HORSES DON'T THEY?, JAWS, THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1-2-3, HANNIBAL).<br />It is a bit hard to say exactly where this novel falters, exactly.  It's like watching a piano player who hits all the right notes, but doesn't quite have the skill to transform the music into something special.  A little more background details about each of the characters would have helped to make them more real (It was hard to sympathize with any of them-- a near-fatal flaw in any story), plus a little more tension, a little more suspense in bringing out the animosity between the townspeople and the professor and his wife.  Though most of the last half of the book deals with the locals attacking the professor's house, there is insufficient psychological depth to really make the violence as gut-wrenching as it should have been.  The fact that some of the writing is awkward doesn't help matters.<br />In the end, this comes across as an uneasy cobbling of DELIVERANCE (which, I know, this novel predates) and THE OX-BOW INCIDENT, not really worthy of revival.	2004-07-15

Like Roger Ebert, you often find yourself recognizing the truth of what he is saying even as he is bashing some of your favorite films.  Hunter is a perceptive critic who can provide great insight into specific films, yet somehow the scope of the book seems too narrow, despite several broader articles about films interspersed between the reviews; THE DEER HUNTER, for instance, is dismissed as a minor and flawed piece of film-making in just a few lines without going in-depth into why he feels this way.  It is frustrating little things like this which prevent me from giving it five stars.  Still, this book provides much food for thought for the film buff.	2004-07-15

However, the book ultimately ends with the question &quot;Why?&quot;, and that is its major flaw.<br />One need only to read Gore Vidal's essay &quot;The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh&quot; (in his book PERPETUAL WAR FOR PERPETUAL PEACE) to understand that the bomber, though, troubled, was an intelligent and sane individual.  In my opinion, it is not hard to understand why he did what he did.  He came from a troubled family life, one which left him without any sense of security or stability in his life.  He was later able to find some of this in the military, where he distinguished himself in the first Gulf War.  However, when he returned to civilian life, he found that his new-found status as a war hero meant nothing, as he was unable to get a decent job.  Doubts about the reasons for going to war made him question the US government, which, coupled with his dire personal life, soon festered into an open hatred for the government, which failed to provide the stability and security just as his parents had failed to provide them.  McVeigh then fell back on the only thing he was good at-- his military training.  In his own twisted way, he had a strong sense of right and wrong, and felt he was doing the country a favor by striking back against the evils of this country's ruling powers.  The federal building was just a symbol to him of the faceless uncaring government, and he probably never even considered the fate of the hundreds of innocents he killed that day; perhaps they were just &quot;collateral damage&quot; to him.  Unless we understand him and others like him, we will be forced to face others like him.	2004-07-15

Macaulay focuses on the architectural and social aspects surrounding these holy structures, so that even those with no knowledge of Islam can appreciate the significance that these buildings have in Muslim culture.  Not only that, the author's drawing style has improved greatly from his books of the mid-70s, bringing more vividness to the subject and doing justice to the intricacies and beauty of the artwork within the mosque.  As always with Macaulay's books, a treat for the eye and the mind.	2004-07-12

The text, though minimal, is packed with information, which is supplemented by the superb and detailed drawings.  One of the coolest aspects of the book, though, is the views from below, as if a rat with x-ray vision were able to gaze up at this intricate maze of technological wonders.  Macaulay's sense of humor is evident throughout, as seen by his inclusion of various critters (including an alligator and an elephant), lots of references to dogs and fire hydrants, a billboard ad for his book PYRAMID, and even a human skull and hand (!!) in one drawing of an excavation.  Great fun to read and highly recommended.	2004-07-11

The drawings, too, are superb, though the one page showing the various bald-headed workers made me think of Blue Man Group.<br />I do have some minor reservations, however, which are not necessarily Macaulay's fault (I am not going to go into alternative theories about how the pyramids were built, or speculation about the &quot;real&quot; purpose of the pyramids).  One, to have built a pyramid of 2 million blocks in 30 years (working 5 months of the year) would have required that over 400 blocks be cut, finished, transported, and set into place EVERY DAY.  Two, he doesn't state how the ramps were built so they could withstand the weight of so many tons of blocks day in and day out.  And third, how was this enormous operation made to run so smoothly despite accidents and other problems that had to have occurred?<br />Despite my reservations, this is still a wonderful book to teach people, especially children, how such a massive undertaking was accomplished.	2004-07-08

Like a modern-day Sherlock Holmes, McCrary objectively analyzes the evidence and makes a conclusion.  His analysis of the Sam Sheppard case has changed my opinion of who the real murderer was.<br />My only complaint, which at least one other reviewer has stated, is that this book (and all the others written by FBI profilers, for that matter) only focus on the successes, and don't deal with cases where profiling has failed miserably (such as the D.C. sniper case).

In between, there are lists of his personal opinions, at least some of which are bound to provoke strong reactions (good and bad) in die-hard film buffs.  There are also several lists of movie cliches that could have been lifted right out of Ebert's LITTLE MOVIE GLOSSARY.  Some fall in the \\"Eh\\" category (movies starring cast members of \\"Seinfeld\\" and \\"Friends\\") and some that are LOL funny (Red carpet flubs by Joan Rivers).  The book is padded out in the extreme, and fleshing it out here and there would have helped-- a lot (his list of in-jokes briefly discusses only 13 films, and his \\"10 movie character imitations that men can't resist doing\\" misses things like Pacino in SCARFACE (\\"Say hello to my li'l frien'\\")).  A mixed bag, but there are worse ways of killing an hour or so.<br />PS: The back cover states that this book is the result of his years of watching thousands of films, yet in his SOURCES, he states that he consulted dozens of movie websites and hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles.

Though she finds common threads in the thinking of psychopathic minds, this is more of an anti-profiling book, as it points out some of the flaws in attempting to pigeonhole criminals into certain types.<br />On the negative side, the book suffers from awkward and sloppy writing, flippant and jokey descriptions (\\"bop-and-drop\\", \\"Smoke a Cigarette\\"), and her tendency to let her emotions get the best of her (referring to serial killers as \\"cowardly\\" and \\"wimps\\".)  The book also suffers from a lack of scientific documentation and/or real-life examples-- in fact, she uses her own fictional examples, which only come off as absurd caricatures of real life.<br />Brown's main purpose, it appears, is to shock the reader out of his/her complacency, and this book is best read by women who are too cavalier or ignorant about their vulnerability to the sick and dangerous predators out there.

While the roster of authors is mostly first-rate, few of these stories rank among their best; some are even rather obvious or pointless.  Out of 59 entries, I woould only recommend three: &quot;Julia's Touch&quot; by David T. Connolly, which has more emotional depth in its three pages than many novels, &quot;My Private Memoirs of the Hoffer Stigmata Pandemic&quot; by Dan Simmons, which has a sick, albeit enjoyable, sense of justice as its theme, and &quot;The Secret&quot; by Steve Allen (!!!), which evokes just the right note of pathos.

There has been a lot of incredible silliness written about alien abductions, but this one takes the cake.  Hell, it takes the whole bakery.  The back cover states, \\"This book tells of how the government and an alien race are working together to win a war against drugs.\\"  Well, gee, the aliens can't be doing too much good, can they?  Just watch the evening news.<br />There are numerous drawings which, even though they are only on the level of a fairly talented high-schooler, are probably the best thing about the book, as the text is written by someone who is barely literate.  I confess I didn't actually read the whole book, but just sections here and there, much of which seems to deal with a government/alien conspiracy against the author and the author's ability to see invisible things no one else can see.<br />Some of the drawings are unintentionally(?) hilarious, such as the one on page 70, which shows the author being subjected to some kind of rectal oscilloscope by a Gray.<br />This book is good for a few sick laughs, nothing more.	2004-06-25

A chilling look at two high school buddies who, finding themselves increasingly marginalized and ignored by society around them, explode in a violent massacre.  Their slaughter of an entire family is made all the more chilling by the fact that they had talked about it for a year or two beforehand, yet no one took them seriously.  Journalist Reang has done a good job of filling in the background details of these two adolescent killers.  Unfortunately, she drops the ball at the end when she ascribes the source of their pathology as a fixation with the fantasy world of Dungeons and Dragons; she seems to dismiss the fact that one of them was a nerd who suffered years of abuse at the hands of fellow schoolmates and the other had had to deal with a nasty divorce between his parents and living for years with an abusive father.  In fact, only one of them had an obsession with D&amp;D, and he was not the dominant one of the two; it could even be said that D&amp;D was a refuge from his pathetic life-- at least, for a time, anyway.  Still, worth a read to see how two very intelligent teens can go terribly wrong without proper guidance.	2004-05-28

I was almost ready to toss it aside, but all the positive reviews here kept me reading, to which I am thankful for, as this is one of the most chilling examinations of the psychopathic mind that you are ever likely to come across in fiction.  Aside from this slow start, the only other fault I had with the novel was that the dad seemed totally clueless and constantly explained away his son's acts in one way or another, though I suppose this may be the wickedly humorous part that some reviews alluded to.  One may debate whether the etiology of Kevin's behavior as portrayed in the novel is accurate or not, but it certainly is miles ahead of Gus Van Zant's critically acclaimed (!!!) pseudo-documentary about the Columbine massacre, ELEPHANT.  This book makes a good companion piece to Putsata Reang's DEADLY SECRETS, a true crime book about two high school buddies who massacre an entire family.	2004-05-28

Unfortunately, as a serious study of these creatures it comes up short, sprinting through all manner of mythical and real-life sightings of serpents which often does not do them justice (the section on the Lake Champlain serpent, for example, is only about 200 words and doesn't even mention the Mansi photograph).  The fact that the artwork bears little resemblance to reported sightings of many of these creatures doesn't help matters any.

Some of the &quot;science&quot; here wouldn't pass muster in a high school science fair.  The main problem is that he fails to adequately control for other variables, so that his results may easily be tainted by other factors.  For instance, he has the owners themselves record the observations of their pets.  What proud owner, consciously or subconsciously, wouldn't want their Fido or Fluffy to be a star performer?<br />The sampling size is small and, he admits, skewed towards those whose pets show positive results.  Some incidents seem to be the result of sheer coincidence (Ruggles, pg. 106-7), or the result of the dog's actions triggering thoughts in the owner (pg. 124).  There is also association by innuendo, where Sheldrake discusses cases where other factors cannot be ruled out, then presents a case or two which &quot;proves&quot; psychic ability.  He also doesn't deal with instances where pets had a reaction not associated with any definitive behavior by the owner.  Not only that, he presents cases where the pet responds to when the owner starts home, cases where the pet responds to when the owner *thinks* of going home, and cases where the pet responds to when the owner is approaching home.  With so many choices, it's no wonder he gets quite a few hits.<br />Mitchell and Rickard's LIVING WONDERS demolishes the myth of canine loyalty after death, and Budiansky's THE TRUTH ABOUT DOGS states that other researchers were unable to replicate Sheldrake's amazing results.  I like pets just as much as anyone else, though I don't feel the need to glorify them with powers that their small brains are incapable of possessing.	2004-05-23

He even effectively refutes Rupert Sheldrake's belief that many dogs are psychic.<br />Another reason people seem to hate this book is Budiansky's twisted Gary Larson-ish humor, which is evidently not to everyone's taste.<br />A third is probably the fact that he advocates hitting, but only in cases where dominance is an issue between dog and owner.  I can understand readers being angry about this, because I think with most dogs a much gentler, albeit still firm, approach is all that is needed.  Also, I would think that getting into a dominance battle with a very large dog will likely end with you being sent to the emergency room.  Other than that, his advice on training and punishment make a lot of sense, and are NOT the thoughts of a dog hater.<br />Still, this is probably the best overall book on canine psychology that I have read.	2004-05-18

Though the many interweaving threads of its plotline make it a difficult read at first, things eventually pull together.  The writing is very good, and the story very colorful, but somehow the parts don't quite add up to a satisfying whole, making one wonder if perhaps the author tried to accomplish too much in its 230 pages.  Still, a very rewarding read for those willing to tough it out.	2004-05-17

On that level, the book is very enjoyable and highly recommended.  Where is comes up short, though, is in the science.<br />While his many tales are very insightful, they are not necessarily indications of general behavior.  And though the book is a wealth of information, some information is clarified or discredited by more recent research (see Desmond Morris' DOGWATCHING and Stephen Budiansky's THE TRUTH ABOUT DOGS).  His jackal/wolf theory about dog evolution, in particular, is invalid.  He gives some valuable information about dog ownership, though this book is not a complete guide to owning a dog.	2004-05-17

This soon causes problems when others gradually begin to realize her secret.<br />This novel was something of a disappointment, as good as the writing is.  Though it does generate a good amount of suspense and shock, I expected something a little more philosophical from this Pulitzer prize-winning author than this glorified Twilight Zone episode.  Instead of dealing with the issue of the soul or what the afterlife is like (which this novel clumsily sidesteps), it degenerates into a battle of wills between people over the dust.  The middle part, especially, lacks credibility, and the ending leaves some plot threads hanging (what happened to the spiders?).

This novel may not be terribly original, but it has some of the most vivid writing I have ever read, especially in the descriptions of Lilith's attempts to deal with the modern world; not only that, it doesn;t rely on gore to deliver the thrills, though it does have its horrific moments.  On the minus side, it is, like I've said, not terribly original, there is some pointless name-dropping, and there is a glaring mistake in chapter 10 in which a woman throws her empty gun away, but then still has it two pages later.

I would put it in the near-great category, along with Nancy Collins' IN THE BLOOD.  Though Somtow is a good writer and does an admirable job of weaving a complex story, by the end, it all seems a bit hollow at the center.  It doesn't help that the novel ends in a predictably bloody fashion.  Perhaps the problem lies in the fact that the vampire is stuck in the body of a 12-year-old boy and therefore, despite assertions to the contrary, cannot see things from an adult perspective and make full sense out of his 2000 years of experience.  Worth reading, but not a keeper.	2004-04-30

It's gleefully schlocky, like some no-budget horror or SF movie, where the makers know they're not making great art, but revel in the experience of their unique vision, anyway.  Like Dean Koontz, Slade throws in everything but the kitchen sink, in this case Jack the Ripper, the tarot, quantum physics, Lovecraft, and cannibalism (there is even a list of sources at the end (!!)) and, like Koontz, Slade will sometimes stop the action to go into a detailed description of an incidental object or idea (in one memorable instance, a long paragraph describing a motorcycle during the middle of a police chase).  The writing is often sloppy and haphazard, and we get glittering nuggets of wisdom like this one: &quot;Loosely defined, a puritan is a prig who loses sleep knowing that someone, somewhere, may be having fun.&quot;  Whoa, dude, what a concept!<br />Quite frankly, I prefer my fiction to be a little more challenging.

Using theological and philosophical arguments, the author makes this sound almost plausible (though he appears to be unaware of the old song &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot; or the silly controversy about subliminal messages in music a few decades ago).  At this point, I was ready to give this novel a four or five star rating.<br />The theological student's quest to discover the reason for the rap star's motives and countermeasures to stop the madness take him to Moscow, where the science gets even shakier.  After that, his quest takes him to Lhasa and Tibet, and it is here where the problems start.  The plot grinds to a halt as the student and other assorted characters run around and spout eastern mystical nonsense for 270 GODDAMN PAGES WHILE THE FATE OF THE WORLD TICKS AWAY!!!  I won't even mention the various absurdities in the plot in which characters miraculously encounter each other, are healed, or escape certain death with remarkable ease using occult powers.<br />A decent ending could have partly redeemed this novel, but the resolution to this apocalyptic problem is one of the lamest, most ridiculous, most infuriating endings I have ever-- EVER!-- read in some three and a half decades of reading fiction.  If you must, read the first two sections, then toss the book aside and make up your own ending.	2004-04-23

On the negative side, both the story and the characters are somewhat unfocused, the writer assumes the reader has a fair amount of knowledge about magick (which, I believe, he writes as *magik*), and the ending degenerates into the usual bloody massacre in which numerous characters meet an ugly death.  In short, he has an intriguing writing style which, once I warmed up to it, I really liked.  Too bad the story fell short of expectations.	2004-04-17

Though the story really didn't begin to take off until halfway through, I stuck with it, and found that he brought all the elements together quite nicely.  It's too bad he didn't take more time to develop the characters or the, um,*atmosphere*-- a good deal more of Lovecraft or, better yet, William Burroughs would have made this novel a lot more memorable.

This, the fourth in Connolly's Charlie Parker series, does not have the all-pervading miasma of the earlier novels, despite what others have said, and the images of ravens as angels of death is a bit awkward, but this is still an incredibly compelling novel.  In tone, I would say it is more like Ross MacDonald as compared to the James Ellroy feel of the earlier novels.  Is Parker finally laying his demons to rest?  It is hard to say, but it appears as if Connolly is tying up some loose ends, though I personally would like to see the series continue if it can keep up the level of quality.  Readers unfamiliar with Connolly should be forewarned that there are characters from earlier novels, and that they made need to keep a notepad handy to keep track of the labrynthine plot and numerous characters.	2004-03-28

He says he rewrites his books about forty or fifty times, and the effort shows, as he writes with a precision that gives the scenes cinematic clarity.  Parker, a PI who has visions of the dead, must hunt down a man who has stolen a small fortune from a minor mob figure, setting off a chain of events that lead to violent encounters between various mob hitmen, freelance assassins, and an almost mythical serial killer that leaves piles of bodies like multi-car smash-ups at a foggy urban intersection with a broken traffic light.  There is hardly a false note in the whole book; most crime writers-- hell, most horror writers-- can only dream of writing stuff this dark and disturbing.  In lesser hands, some of Parker's philosophical ruminations would surely win some kind of Bulwer-Lytton award (&quot;It was a dark and stormy night . . .&quot;), but here they give added depth to the pervading sense of evil and chaos.  Believe it or not, his third book, THE KILLING KIND, is even more dark and evil, and makes Thomas Harris look like Dr. Seuss.  He's already made the short list of my favorite crime writers.	2004-03-19

Fortunately, some of the members of the scientific team are psychics who know a thing or two about White Magick.  Thus, their advanced technology can do little but record psychic fields as the forces of Good and Evil battle it out.<br />Author Stewart Farrar was the High Priest of a white witch coven, so this mildly entertaining novel is more of interest for its knowledge of occult ritual (it helps for the reader to have some basic familiarity with modern witchcraft) than it is for any thrills, especially for readers more attuned to violence and gore than more reasoned examinations of the occult.

While some of the information is eye-opening and valuable, one soon begins to feel that the scope of the book is a bit too narrow-- only two dozen people offer their viewpoints, and often they are less than candid about various situations.

In clear non-technical prose, he shows what happened and why.<br />This short book (163 pages plus sources and index) is divided into five chapters.  Chapter 1 gives a brief overview of how the worldwide depression began and how it created a domino effect throughout Europe and the U.S.  Nothing new here-- in fact, this is basic stuff any high schooler should know.<br />Chapter 2 is a more detailed examination of the economic crisis and the forces which led to it.  Smiley explains the situation in basic terms that anyone can understand, allowing us to see the tragedy unfolding step by step.<br />Chapters 3 and 4 show how President Roosevelt (who had little knowledge or experience of economics) attempted to pull the country out of this deep economic slump.  Though some programs were successful, some were not, and only serve to create a depression within a depression in the mid-30s.<br />Chapter 5 examines the legacy of the governmental response, and how economic policies initiated during this period has affected this country for decades afterward, and how certain government programs still exist long after their usefulness has passed.  An examination of post-war analysis shows how Keynesian economic theory and government studies have misinterpreted the factors which brought this country back to recovery.  He also examines the question of whether such an event can happen again, concluding that-- based on subsequent economic downturns-- it probably won't, though it can happen again should future leaders ignore the warning signs and lessons of the past.<br />A fascinating and rewarding book, even for those who have little or no knowledge of economics.	2004-03-05

Though it only surveys the economic scene until 1989 (a postscript brings it up to 1992), it is not hard to believe that things haven't changed much since then.  Basically, it concludes that the gap between the rich and the poor has increased to a greater extent than at any time since before the Great Depression, and that the gap between the rich and the poor is greater than in most European countries.<br />Not only does this book outline the problem in detail, but it proposes a restructured tax system similar to that existing in many European countries, a tax system which would ease the burden on the poor, while placing little extra tax burdens on the rich-- and still raise billions more in tax revenue.  Though this book is filled with statistical analyses, it is slim (fewer than a hundred pages), and those not mathematically inclined can skip to the conclusions here and there, which are written in clear, understandable prose.  Well worth reading, and certain to be a wake-up call to anyone who has suspected that the middle class has been disappearing in this country.	2004-02-26

In little more than 200 pages, he explains clearly and concisely how the government should work-- and how and why it often doesn't.  What makes O'Rourke different from the current batch of conservative goose-steppers is that 1) he is intelligent, 2) he is (relatively) unbiased, taking shots at the Right as well as the Left, 3) he gets his facts straight, and 4) he is gut-bustingly funny (I was laughing so hard on the bus, people were avoiding me more than the stinky homeless guy).

On the plus side, there are a few interesting revelations (the info on lisping, for example), and there are quizzes to help assess your abilities to read people (though there are the inherent dangers of self-deception and misinterpretation in such self-scoring tests).  She only devotes a page or two to cultural differences and neurological problems, and she makes the common mistake of assigning specific interpretations to various acts of body language.  There are also some glaring signs of sloppy editing as, at one point when talking about Lady Di, she makes a reference to a previous mention of her in the book which does not exist, and at another point refers to information in an appendix which does not exist.

Her list of behavioral indicators for various traits is rather long, and she makes the basic mistake of pigeonholing certain characteristics as indicators of specific traits.  She also doesn't deal with such topics as neurological problems or cultural differences.  Some of her advice is a bit iffy, too; for instance, she says early on, &quot;Learn to reveal something of yourself.

If this sounds like something that would be useful for law enforcement officers in obtaining confessions from known offenders, you wouldn't be far off.  The book doesn't really deal with the prospect of using these techniques on someone who ultimately proves to be innocent, and the underhanded nature of many of them could likely backfire.  More than a few of these strategies are a bit questionable, and one would have to have a little experience and intuitive insight in using the right technique at the right time.

The author is an expert in interrogation, and it shows-- the book is grounded in solid psychological fact, and is one that is certain to improve the people-reading skills of most readers.  He also dispels some myths, such as those promoted by proponents of Neuro-Linguistic Programming.

US	30555336	RG7HAEIM4W0BB	9997539389	426060608	Legion of the Dead	Books	3	2	2	N	N	minor zombie novel	This is as much a political novel about the attempt to overthrow the dictatorship of a Caribbean country as it is a novel about zombies and voodoo.  An American writer visiting the country of San Marlo becomes caught up in a revolutionary movement to overthrown the repressive government, which carries out killings and kidnappings with the help of a zombie army.  While it is a decent read, there really aren't enough details about politics or voodoo to make this novel special.  Recommended for those who don't like their horror novels with gallons of gore.	2004-02-12

Chronicles of Human Stupidity	Books	4	2	4	N	N	dumb de dumb dumb	I believe it was Einstein who said that only two things were infinite, the universe and human stupidity.  Enterprising writers have turned the latter into a cottage industry, News of the Weird and The Darwin Awards being two of the more well-known examples.  This book is a worthy contender, with nearly 250 pages of prime Grade-A idiocy.  While I've docked it one star for lack of documentation (I suspect a few fictional and/or urban legend stories may have snuck in), those merely looking for a good laugh at the expense of other members of our highly-evolved(?) species will get their money's worth.  Categorized into 12 chapters, each of which could probably have been a book in itself.	2004-02-12
US	30555336	R9ZEY97OQZTC7	0765343533	277811011	Pact of the Fathers	Books	2	2	3	N	N	flat and uninvolving	This novel never really shifted into second gear.  There were few surprises, much of the plot was painfully obvious, and there were far too many descriptions of insignificant things.  There was not much sense of menace or suspense in this so-called horror novel, and the climax felt rushed and tacked on.  A major disappointment from this usually stellar author.	2004-02-05
US	30555336	R344BJHWWF2282	096720299X	738262724	Moon on the Water	Books	3	4	5	N	N	over-rated?	Considering the number of good reviews his short stories have gotten, I expected a lot more from this book.  For the most part, the stories do not live up to the hype-- the writing was undistinguished, and many of the plots were too obvious or just left me scratching my head in bewilderment.  Some of them rambled on aimlessly or dwelt too heavily on basic racial conflicts.  Of the 22 stories in this collection, the only ones I really enjoyed were &quot;Pop is Real Smart&quot;, &quot;The Call&quot;, and &quot;Other Advantages&quot;.	2004-02-05
US	30555336	R3LI62RVH8162I	0671027387	315416156	Deception Point	Books	5	3	3	N	N	pure adrenaline	This thriller hits the ground running and never lets up for the next 550 pages, making this a dizzying marathon of conspiracy, white-knuckle escapes, and double-crosses.  Hell, I didn't even mind that the characters were a bit cartoonish at times, that people routinely escaped from situations that would normally have meant certain death, or that the author was constantly throwing bits of arcane scientific knowledge around like holiday confetti.  If this was a movie, you would just kick back with the jumbo bucket of popcorn and enjoy the next couple hours.  I'm definitely going to check out his other novels.	2004-01-27
US	30555336	R3JPBAXMKK94WH	0451411188	434150538	Deep Fire Rising	Books	5	11	11	N	N	move over, James Bond	I read this right after reading Dan Brown's DECEPTION POINT and, while it doesn't have the pure adrenaline rush of that novel, this is still one helluva thriller.  The ingenious plot has an obscure order of monks who are able to predict when cataclysmic geological events will occur, only they are split between keeping it a secret and using it for their own gain.  Geologist Philip Mercer finds himself caught in the middle, and soon finds himself racing against the clock to prevent a geological disaster that could cost the lives of tens of millions of people.  Though an intriguing plotline is dropped early on, and there are questions as to how a certain device could have been invented and constructed, these are only minor complaints.  In a thick book filled with cutting-edge science and jaw-dropping action scenes, my favorites have to be Mercer's underground discovery at Area 51 and a scene on a ferry halfway through the book.  DuBrul is one more name to add to my must-read list.	2004-01-27
US	30555336	R1KHQ0GN529TVQ	0583126421	725655309	The Gang	Books	4	1	1	N	N	vintage '70s noir fiction	THE GANG is composed of Celia, a six-foot tall mistress to some of the rich and famous; Bert, a meek, middle-aged writer of crime fiction; Manny, a handsome talent agent; and his juvenile delinquent son, Mark.  Through circumstances beyond their control, they join forces to form a gang, ripping off businesses for thousands and shooting anyone who gets in their way.  As absurd as this scenario sounds, Kastle somehow manages to pull it off with a combination of fully-developed characters and believable plot development.  If it had been made into a movie, it could have fit easily alongside such crime films as THE GETAWAY (the Peckinpah version) and DIRTY MARY AND CRAZY LARRY.  Worth checking out.	2004-01-16
US	30555336	R3RF5UABBJPWEH	0491001193	585813102	Millionaires	Books	4	4	4	N	N	lifestyles of the rich and decadent	The cover of this novel makes it look like another caper novel in the tradition of THE ANDERSON TAPES, 11 HARROWHOUSE, or THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE, though it is an entirely different animal.  The last surviving member of a once-wealthy family comes home to an exclusive Florida island inhabited by some of the richest people in America, intending to take it over with his small band of hand-picked criminals and loot it of millions.  This caper is only a small part of the novel, and only one more jaded thrill for those whom nothing is sacred or forbidden.  The set-up for this crime takes a while, and it is all these criminals can do to keep from tearing at each other's throats and tip the authorities before they can pull it off.  Like I said, not a caper novel, but if you're looking for well-drawn characters in a sordid '70s sub-DYNASTY-like atmosphere, you won't be disappointed.	2004-01-16
US	30555336	R1WIFW3NWP7GDL	0061015725	245555180	Prey	Books	3	5	7	N	N	fascinating science, formulaic story	The terrors and pitfalls of nanotechnology are endless and far-reaching, and Crichton uses this to good advantage.  The frequent explanations along the way, which some have said are dry and academic, to me added to the suspense, making the swarms of nanobots all the more frightening.  These nanobots are so real, in fact, that they threaten to overshadow the cardboard characters and formulaic plot (this science-run-amok template goes all the way back to FRANKENSTEIN).  The characters are uninteresting and, in order for the plot to move along, they make some stupid mistakes so that the 'bots can get the upper hand (the main character, in fact, is so passive in the face of deception that he could just as well be sleep-walking).  Then, at the end, the 'bots make some stupid mistakes for the plot to come to its conclusion.  Read it for the science, not the story.<br />This novel brought to mind similar, better, novels:  A. A. Merritt's THE METAL MONSTER, Poul Anderson's BRAIN WAVE, Dean Koontz's PHANTOMS, and the novel MUTANT 59: THE PLASTIC EATERS.	2004-01-15
US	30555336	RWM73V08G58A1	0312988249	912105779	Compulsion: A Novel (Frank Clevenger)	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Ablow's third is a winner	Ablow's last novel PROJECTION turned me off so much I didn't want to read any more of his books, but I gave this a try anyway, and I'm glad I did.  This is a first-rate psychological thriller with hardly a false note in the entire book.  Though the murder of a child within the confines of a troubled household may not be the most original plotline, Ablow's keen psychological insight guides you masterfully through the twists and turns of a deeply disturbed family, springing surprises just when you thought you had everything figured out.  Highly recommended.	2004-01-15
US	30555336	R15J3IOKV1FKX4	0451410319	834173133	Hush	Books	4	1	3	N	N	dynamite debut	Serial killer novels are a dime a dozen now, and ones where the killer squares off with his long-time nemesis in law enforcement is getting to be a cliche, but this novel's strong grounding in realistic psychology make this one stand head and shoulders above most.  The fact that the killer's motives and actions have a solid basis in psychological fact make them all the more chilling, especially in the scene where he gives profiler Ivy Dunlap a present.  There are a few missteps and cliches, especially at the beginning, preventing me from giving this 5 stars, but I still give this a strong recommendation.	2004-01-15
US	30555336	R33CHF6A8VQDCP	B00005XZ9A	603263428	The Witches of Brimstone Hill	Books	3	1	2	N	N	inoffensive minor thriller	This is one of those occult novels written B.K. (Before King), where the occult elements were only one facet in the interactions of a group of individuals, rather than the main focus.  In fact, this story of a young woman with psychic powers who gradually becomes aware of a devil's coven in the town's midst is rather mild and inoffensive and, if there had been some romance and a handsome stranger for her to fall into the arms of at the end, this could almost have been one of those gothic thrillers that were churned out by the hundreds during that time (late 60s- early 70s).  Slight and unmemorable.	2004-01-15
US	30555336	R137H1PSANZR59	0740728946	330800394	Groovitude: A Get Fuzzy Treasury	Books	5	4	4	N	N	pets with attitude	This strip was only in the paper a few days before I became a fan of Rob Wilco and his seriously offbeat pets.  Though it superficially resembles Garfield, the characters are more fully developed, are better drawn (this is one of the best-looking comic strips in the paper), and are a lot more-- well-- non-linear in their thinking.  In fact, this is probably how real cats and dogs would attempt to cope with the human world if they could interact with us.  Though there are a few strips that fall flat, there are enough seriously deranged ones to make up for it.  It may not join the ranks of the all-time classic strips, but it's close enough for me.	2004-01-09
