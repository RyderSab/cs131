His ideological blinders are so great that he is prepared to murder his own daughter, and he and his sons attack the drowning people who seek shelter in their ark, rationalizing their actions as fulfilling God's plan.  Noah's wife and daughter gradually come to the realization that the voices talking to Noah are solely in his own head, and work together to save the daughter and a stowaway on the ark from Noah's wrath.  In an era where one of the leading causes of human suffering is religious fundamentalism, this book's message for children is that religious fanaticism and ideologies of all stripes blind us to our common humanity and lead us into disaster.  The book was the Whitbread Children's Book of the Year in 2004, which is probably Great Britain's most prestigious children's book award.	2005-09-10

At some point in the not too far future, the author posits, we will have personal shoppers hardwired into our brains, and those who don't make the right shopping choices won't get their chips fixed when they malfunction, consigning their bodies to oblivion.  Things like public schools and clouds will be  turned into private property, trademarked and owned by corporations.  American firms will use up most available earth resources to maximize their profits and will quite properly be the focus of the world community's anger (sound familiar?)  Even if you don't buy into the author's political views, this is still a good science fiction read, but the swear words on each page and the sex scenes make it less than optimal for any audience below high school.	2005-03-15

This book proceeds on the outlandish assumption that the 13-year-old daughter of Paul Revere had a crush on leader of the Revolution Joseph Warren, 20 years her senior, and was angry at him because she thought he had a crush on her step-mother, Paul Revere's wife.  While there's no historical basis for any of this, most of the book is taken up with the daughter's inability to tell Warren that she's sorry for treating him badly, with a few actual facts thrown in.  While Paul Revere's story is one of the most exciting of the Revolution -- and in fact there's an argument there would have been no Revolution without him -- you won't learn much about it from this book unless you already know the facts and can pick up on some elliptical references.  What's worse, you come out of it having no idea whether any particular \\"fact\\" you just read has any historical basis.  A much better choice is \\"In Their Own Words: Paul Revere,\\" by George Sullivan, real history, and easy to read.	2005-02-27

The God of the Bible here, who looks just like a man only bigger, has the emotional depth of a two-year-old: he creates Man just so that He can be adored and becomes petulant when his creations show any signs of independence.  Eve, because she is a woman, spends her time in the Garden of Eden inventing every useful thing you can think of, from boats to dogsleds to clothes to rappelling ropes.  Adam, because he is a man, mostly daydreams, lazes around, and occasionally shows off how fast he can run.  The Serpent, because he is not a man, is the fount of all wisdom and knowledge and spends his time figuring out how he can get Adam and Eve away from God out into the real world.  God is not only capricious and jealous, he is also a pederast -- he keeps giving Eve inappropriate \\"hugs\\" -- and a voyeur -- he forces Adam to \\"rape\\" Eve to see whether \\"all the parts are working properly.\\"  Most of the book is taken up with Eve's psychological distress resulting from the rape, which doesn't stop her from having a wonderful night of sex with the Serpent, who tries to drug her in advance, and asking him for more the next night.   We all know how the story ends -- Adam and Eve finally get out of the Garden and away from God with the Serpent's help.  The author says she came up with the idea for this book in Church -- I wonder, given her theological perspective, what she was doing there?	2005-02-14

The book is marred, however, by the author's characterization of every slave as a saint, and every slave-owner as a vicious, mean-spirited, child-abusing drunk.  It's almost as if the author does not trust the child reader to \\"get\\" that slavery was evil, and so feels that she has to reemphasize it in a heavy-handed way.

Reading this book made me angry, and reading all the 5-star reviews only made it worse.  The book makes clear that the author's mother abandoned her entire Jewish family, married an African-American after apparently having no social life whatsoever except having previously become pregnant by what seems to have been a con man, never contacted her Jewish family again after she abandoned them except to ask them for money, and never thereafter went to see her mother even when the mother was dying in a hospital a quick train ride away.  She converted to Christianity and then spent a lifetime concealing information about her past from her children.  When one son, a sometime-reporter, decided that her story would make a good book, he took down uncritically a frankly completely unbelievable story about a miserly, money-hungry, child-abusing, wife-abusing, violent rabbi father, someone who seems to have stepped off the pages of an anti-Semitic tract.  The Jewish family life described in this book comes right out of the pages of the Jew of Malta, complete with bloodthirsty and barbaric rituals, mindless rules, usury, and utter hatred of others.  In writing this up, the son makes no effort to contact his living aunt or many living cousins who might have cast any doubt on his mother's story.  Given that even to the casual reader it is apparent that the mother's tale is a carefully constructed rationalization and justification of her own decision to cut all family ties, the son's uncritical acceptance of this fable is shocking.  I would take this as a work of fiction until proven otherwise.	2005-01-29

And in contrast to the views spotlighted above, several of them have also read Kate DiCamillo's \\"Because of Winn-Dixie\\" and think that \\"Ida B.\\" is a much better read, and I agree.   This is the rare book that creates a direct connection between the reader and the protagonist's emotions and motivations; the children I know who have read the book all have remarked about how the author allowed them to \\"get inside\\" the protagonist's head in ways they hadn't experienced before.  Ida B. has all the runaway emotions and issues of self-control that elementary school children struggle with -- anger at her parents for not fulfilling all of their promises, anger at her schoolmates and teachers for not allowing her to fit in, anger at the very environment around her for not staying perpetually the same.  She has moments of elation and moments of deep depression.  She comes up with creative ways to \\"punish\\" her parents for breaking their promises.  In other words, she's a real child and not the usual paragon that we typically find in children's fiction.  Eventually Ida B. manages to reconcile herself to her surroundings in different ways -- by the end of the book she is able to make peace with herself and those around her in ways that rang true to me and to the children I know who have read the book.  Ultimately, the book's message for children is an optimistic one -- don't despair, because no matter how hard things seem, you will find ways of coping, and this too shall pass.	2005-01-28

Naomi Leon's mother is an alcoholic who goes in and out of institutions.  She leaves Naomi and her brother alone for a weekend to go shopping when they are toddlers.  She abandons them thereafter for seven years with no contact.  She shows up abruptly one day and tells her son, who has some birth defects, that he is a freak.  She wants to take Naomi with her in a move to Las Vegas so she can collect support from the state, but won't take her son.  How many mothers do you know who are this evil?  This book is a typical product of the politically correct American book publishing industry, pushing their usual message: parents can be detrimental to kids, feelings of hate towards your parents can be normal, and \\"alternative\\" families are often better.  The book adds a trip to Mexico to escape the mother to fit in with the publishers' demand for alternative, non-Western, \\"authentic\\" experiences.  I don't know any kids who like being hit over the head repeatedly with these sorts of obvious political messages.  Is it any wonder that the British publishing industry -- which publishes J.K.

In a nameless land full of danger, a boy who needs to escape and move on to a better world carries a miraculous fish that seemingly changes size and appearance at will; the boy's caring for the fish at all costs helps to ensure his survival.  The boy also has an extraordinary guide (known only as \\"the Guide\\") who appears in human form but quite clearly, according to one character in the book, had previously died.  The Guide tells the boy that he will survive only if he completely trusts in Him.  The Guide mysteriously disappears after guiding the boy (and his parents, who are aid workers) to safety.   <br /> <br />I would have enjoyed this book more if the author had played it straight.  There are relatively few books for this age group about aid workers who help people all over the world notwithstanding constant privation and danger.  Kids could use more books encouraging altruism as a matter of simple human decency, and without a supernatural reward for this sort of behavior as the \\"hook.\\"	2004-09-23
US	32903860	R291ODPW7ITGO3	1573229865	234989381	The Dream of Scipio	Books	4	16	18	N	N	Not really a novel -- more of a didactic exercise	I had difficulty connecting to this book because it seems purposely designed to be more of a didactic exercise or an intellectual puzzle than a novel.  The key to the puzzle is the title - the book plays out the theme of the actual \\"Dream of Scipio\\" by Cicero.  Cicero posits that men are placed on earth to pursue \\"virtue,\\" rather than fame, and that only if they have been successful will their spark of divine fire return to its source.  If they are unsuccessful, their divine spark will remain on earth, presumably passing from body to body until the spark finds the necessary connection to the ultimate.  I read the book as constructed to show these sparks (and perhaps really only one single spark) attempting to \\"connect\\" in three different generations, while at the same time illustrating history's repeating wheel. The book presents two iconic representations of \\"true\\" civilization - first, three love interests, who bear no resemblance to actual breathing women and seem to be little more than incarnations of the Muses.  The second are the Jews; the state of their treatment by surrounding societies is civilization's bellweather.  In each generation an individual's reaction to incitement against the Jews will be a mark of his real virtue.  These two representations are connected: in each generation, the \\"love interest\\" draws closer to the Jews, perhaps making the protagonist's ability to connect to virtue symbolically more difficult in succeeding generations.  (The first, Sophia, prefers Jews to Christians; the second, Rebecca, pretends she is a Jew; and the third, Julia, really is a Jew, albeit a lapsed one.)   <br />     The failure of the first generation's attempt to connect to the divine (Manlius') demonstrates that what we traditionally think of as \\"civilization\\" can be an active hindrance to virtue, since its rationalizations lead Manlius to betrayal and murder.  Manlius identifies his own interests (mostly financial) as \\"civilization,\\" and cannot divorce himself sufficiently from those interests (as Cicero's text suggests he must) to find virtue.  In the second attempt, Olivier spends much of his life pursuing Manlius' civilization in the form of the same texts that fascinated Manlius; but in the end he recognizes that the texts he has been so assiduously gathering are a mere \\"form of words,\\" and that he should instead follow his \\"soul's desire\\" and put himself in harm's way, if necessary, to save what he loves.   Julien follows the model of Manlius until love, a human connection, forces him to throw his rationalizations to the wind, and then loyalty, another human connection, pushes him into the ultimate sacrifice (in a true martyrdom he burns not only himself, but his sacred texts, which he realizes are meaningless).   <br />   The message here that I like is that theory can lead you down a slippery slope of rationalizations justifying evil deeds, and that philosophical exercises are dangerous both in and of themselves, and because they persuade the thinker of his own intellectual and therefore moral superiority.  I also like the message that human connection tempers theory and is necessary to find virtue.  What I don't like is the implicit conclusion that the compromises inherent in any involvement in public affairs are corrupt and corrupting.  While the book has an admirable philo-Semitic theme, at the same time it is very Christian - \\"love is the solution.\\"  While this is equally a philosophical extreme that can lead to intemperate results, it seems to be a favorite of Pears', since it is also at the heart of his Instance of the Fingerpost book.	2004-08-17

A good illustration is the caption on one of the first pages under a picture of the Western Wall.  The caption says that this is a picture of a site that \\"Jews believe\\" was the site of the Temple, and \\"Muslims believe\\" was the site of a revelation to the prophet Mohammed.  But there is absolutely no historical or other evidence that Mohammed ever set foot in Jerusalem.  Nor is there even any mention of Jerusalem in the Qur'an.  Even reputable Arab scholars have concluded that the later Muslim interpretation of the words \\"far mosque\\" in the Qur'an as a reference to Jerusalem is simply wrong.  On the other hand, there is no dispute among historians or archaeologists that the pictured Western Wall IS the outer wall of the Jewish Second Temple, destroyed by the Romans in the year 70.  Moreover, there is little dispute that the Second Temple was raised on the site of a previous Jewish Temple that the Bible says was originally built by King Solomon.  There is archaeological evidence for a \\"House of Yahweh\\" on this site much predating the Second Temple, and there are contemporary references to specific descendants of Solomon in the archaeological record as well.  How can this book equate the two claims to the Western Wall as simply equally valid \\"beliefs\\"? Similarly, the book spends several pages blaming Israel for the 1956 war with Egypt, but manages to be very evenhanded and withhold any blame when it comes to the vicious and unprovoked attack on Israel in 1973 by three Arab states during the holiest day of the year for Jews.

The third page of text describes Tel Aviv as a city with \\"huge rubbish dumps, and the rivers are full of pollution.\\"  The nominal protagonist of the book, an Israeli girl named Ella, is thankful for the \\"double-glazed windows in our apartment, and we could not sleep at night without them\\" because of the \\"noise and pollution,\\" which \\"make it a difficult place to live.\\"  Is this the first (and practically the only) thing that a reader should know about Tel Aviv?  Where was the editor here?	2003-12-16
US	32903860	R1GLVNZ3AJGBY0	0431083223	121685843	Israel (A Visit to)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	A fine introduction for young readers	This is one of those books published by an educational publisher for the purpose of selling more books to school libraries; the authors have published children's books in every field imaginable, and so are experts on everything and nothing.  This might explain the page in this book that says that &quot;many famous musicians, such as Zubin Mehta, have come from Israel&quot; (Mehta is, of course, Indian).  That said, this is a perfectly fine book for readers 4-8; most of each page is a picture, with no more than 25 words per page in big print.  (Do tell your kids that Mehta is not an Israeli, however.)	2003-12-16

Since the political issues take a back seat to culture and history in this book, this is still a very worthwhile purchase.	2003-12-16
US	32903860	R59SK8LF2WNF0	0756501296	21937109	Israel (First Reports - Countries)	Books	1	4	5	N	N	Not recommended	Imagine a book about Wisconsin that said, \\"Wisconsin now has land that was once called Millocki by the indigenous peoples.  The native peoples who live there believe the land is their home.  They are called Algonquians.  They want to live on their land just as their parents and grandparents did.\\"  Now substitute the word \\"Palestinians\\" for \\"Algonquians,\\" and you will have a page from this book.  This constant undermining of Israel's legitimacy and its basic right to exist at all has spread to kids' literature.  Choose instead \\"Enchantment of the World: Israel,\\" by Stephen and Martin Hintz, or \\"A Ticket to Israel,\\" by Marcia Gresko, \\"Welcome to Israel,\\" by Lilly Rivlin, or \\"Steadwell Books World Tour: Israel,\\" by Priya Seshan and Christopher Mitten.	2003-12-16

Also included are chapters on \\"quick facts,\\" \\"more to read,\\" and a glossary.	2003-12-16

When you then read on the first page of the book that Israel's eastern border is the \\"Palestinian territory,\\" you know that you are not dealing with a fair-minded author.  The first page also says that it was \\"tensions between the two groups\\" -- Israelis and Palestinians -- that led to \\"a series of wars and uprisings\\" after 1948, with no mention of the Arab countries' invasion of Israel in 1948 or subsequent hostile acts.  To read just the first page would have you believe that Israel has been continually accumulating additional Arab land since 1948, for no rhyme or reason.  The rest of the book follows the same pattern; there's always a reason for Arab discontent, but never a good reason for Israeli responses.  Not recommended.	2003-12-16
US	32903860	R3T7OUBXZU6R6E	0789420635	522897600	Illustrated Jewish Bible for Children	Books	5	7	18	N	N	A great book for both Jewish and non-Jewish kids	This book contains beautiful retellings of stories from the Hebrew bible, with photos of archaeological objects that match the stories and other relevant illustrations and maps on the margins on each page.  This is one of the favorite books at my kids' Hebrew Day School library.  The only references to Jesus in the book are in the introduction, which states that these are the stories that Jesus would have read (undeniably true, unless you think Jesus was fictional), and that Christians have two Bibles, the Old Testament and the New Testament, and the stories in the New Testament concern Jesus (also undeniably true).  Why anyone would think that the book or the book title is \\"misleading\\" in some way because of these innocuous references is unclear.  Highly recommended for all kids.	2003-12-13
US	32903860	R1PIPMJ0QK0V1J	1590181158	426639027	Israel (Modern Nations of the World (Lucent))	Books	1	5	7	N	N	Not recommended	This unattractive children's book about Israel presents some peculiar ideas.  On the first page the author declares that \\"some\\" people \\"question Israel's right to exist.\\" That same first page claims that Zionists wanted Israel \\"to belong to the Jews alone,\\" and are to blame for current political conflicts.  The second page says that \\"a bloody War of Independence over control of the region took place upon the declaration of the State of Israel in 1948,\\" not seeing fit to reveal that the only reason there was a \\"bloody war\\" is that the Arabs would not accept a Jewish state and invaded.  Two pages later, the author states that even though Israel has \\"democratic institutions,\\" it is not really a democracy, since allegedly \\"religious law, as interpreted by very strict Orthodox rabbis from biblical texts, takes precedence\\" over laws passed by Israel's Parliament.  These \\"Jewish ways,\\" declares the author, are just \\"a bit old-fashioned and out of touch.\\"  Not only is the author's depiction of modern Israeli history skewed, her description of Jewish life in the diaspora is peculiar:  \\"Because they continued to follow Jewish laws regarding what they ate\\" as well as \\"who they would and would not marry, they tended to stick out wherever they went.\\"  Moreover, because their \\"different practices often made interaction [with Gentiles] difficult,\\" Jews \\"often did not object to being isolated in their own neighborhoods.\\"  In other words, Jews were herded into ghettos in Europe really by their very own choice.  There are many better choices available for children's books on this subject; this one is not recommended.	2003-12-01
