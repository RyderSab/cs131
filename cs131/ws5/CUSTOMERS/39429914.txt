US	39429914	R3NNUJ4TDQUZPZ	0743491912	796439447	Raising Atlantis	Books	4	8	12	N	N	Not Bad	I liked the story and it kept me engaged throughout. It has been done before. I just read a book called Decipher which was similar. However, that is not necessarily a criticism as it is no different than writing murder mysteries. There are only so many ways to kill someone. Here, there are only so many ways to show Atlantis in the Arctic. My biggest complaint is the main character which someone described as whiny (or something like that). I liked the main character but have to admit I didn't love or identify with him as well as some other protagonists.<br /><br />I think he pulled off the ending well, though I can see where some might not be totally satisfied with it. I am easy to please!<br /><br />I really wish Thomas the best and think he has a great writing career ahead of him. I will definitely look for his next book.	2005-10-03
US	39429914	R1KQV9DMTIYEJI	0786017112	52908973	The Home	Books	5	4	4	N	N	He Keeps Getting Better!	Scott put out an amazing story and his work keeps getting better all the time. Set in a creepy home for wayward kids, he creates an atmosphere that does the story justice. The characters are well developed and he uses them in a way that fits the story perfectly. He also provides a nice twist at the end. Others have gone into details about the story so I won't do that here. But what I will do is say that the story kept me engaged and wanting to turn the next page. His dialogue and narrative do not overbear, unlike a few books I've read recently, so it was not a chore to read it. It was fun to read and it instilled the creepy atmosphere one would expect from a horror novel. He is not Bentley Little, he is not Stephen King, he is not Dean Koontz. He is Scott Nicholson and he is a unique voice that is on a par with all of them. He is his own man and if you want good and engaging horror, you can't go wrong with his stories! Highly recommended.	2005-09-07

I was not disappointed! Another reader complained about the flashbacks that are placed throughout the story. I found them enlightening and they all added to the depth of the characters. I especially like that the villains are known right from the start. Then the protagonist has to figure out who they are. We see as the pieces all fall together. I also like that she brings in a touch of Native American culture since much of the story takes place in and around a reservation. Makes me feel the heat, smell the dust, see the saguaros out there. All in all, a very entertaining read and a great way to pass the time at the airport!	2005-08-16

I loved the technical earthquake stuff with the spilled chemicals polluting the river, the effects on the ground and river, and in particular, the nuke part. I liked the characters too, especially when the KKK guys get their due. But it was also a chore to read as it went on and on. In my opinion, he could have told a much tighter story minus about 400 pages. That is my biggest problem with it. Mr. Williams is an excellent story teller, but to keep me interested, I would recommend keeping it shorter. I've been looking for other books by him but have not seen any yet. If his next story is also 800+ pages, I'm afraid I'll have to skip it.	2005-05-24

POV shifts, grammatical errors, pages upon pages of exposition, jargon, etc. Well, Mr. Pavlou did it and I'll give him credit for being damn lucky. The basic story was not too bad, but pages upon pages of theories made reading it like going through a college text. It was a chore, but I persevered. By the end of the story, I still did not know who was who except for the bad guy and one of the main heroes. They were just names lost in the jargon. See, I mentioned the word \\"jargon\\" again. I might expect this from a fourth or fifth novel, where the editors pay less attention, but not a first one.<br /><br />I did not hate this story, and Mr. Pavlou obviously put a lot of work into it. But like another reviewer said, he could have done it by cutting out about 200 pages just as well. POV was a big problem in that sometimes, I had no idea who was talking or what they were thinking. Maybe it is just me getting too deep in to editor mode as I struggle to get published.<br /><br />Anyway, though not my highest recommendation, if you don't mind learning a lot of \\"facts\\" this would be a good read. I just wish I knew who his agent was!	2005-04-04

This story has a great plot, great characters, and plenty of action. I could feel the grit under my collar when they hit the Omani desert in the Empty Quarter. James usually has an icky bug in the story but this one has a new twist with the desert women. And what they find under the desert is... wow! Bring on the buckyballs! My only complaint is that the story ended. Great stuff!	2005-02-14

I love the Appalachian setting and the mixed cast of characters. The manor (the building) reminds me of a haunted house I know of in central West Virginia and Scotts' story is based on a real manor.<br /><br />Scott does a great job building up the tension as events start to shape the actions of each character. You get subtle hints from each character that something is not right and the climax holds some nice surprises.<br /><br />I highly recommend this story for all fans of great horror. A \\"really great shew!\\"	2004-11-02

James takes us on an adventure up north to the polar ice cap.

I like the characters and the way they interact with each other. I also like the great plot twist at the end. With his experience as a veterinarian, he adds believable \\"icky bugs\\" to the story too. Those vicious whale creatures are quite something.<br /><br />All I can say is, James, rock on!

His plot plus the unique underground world he created gave me hours of reading pleasure. I highly recommend this book to anyone that appreciates good action/adventure stories.<br /><br />When I read this sixteen years ago, as of 2015, I didn't do a good enough review here on Amazon. I still remember the story and though I won't rehash what others have probably done a hundred times or more, I will say it had it all. Action, adventure, thrills and icky bugs! Can't ask for more than that.<br /><br />I've met James several times and we talked about his earlier work including this novel and his including icky bugs since he is also a veterinarian. I really enjoyed those talks and it inspired me in my writing.<br /><br />What I also like is his clean style that he used to have with solid third-person and no head-hopping, something he's strayed from lately. What he never has strayed from is a brisk narrative and not bogging down with overbearing rambling which ruins some thrillers. This story, as all of his do, moves!<br /><br />I enjoyed every page and closed the book with a smile on my face. Highly recommended.	2004-06-09

There have been a few that threw me because the heroes all seem to either die or get hacked up. At least Zinc Chandler has made it this far with most of his body parts!<br />I loved the way things ended in this story but my only criticism is the same thing several other people mentioned. Way too much background on cannibals and the South Seas. It is only a minor complaint. Because of his earlier books, I know what the red serge is and what RCMP means! I don't mind learning something new, but only so much! That's what non-fiction books are for!<br />Oh yeah, it doesn't hurt that he/she is an Alice Cooper fan either. Halo of Flies is one of my favorite songs. Rock on Michael!	2004-03-28

I will not go into details about the story since others have done that but I will say that until I read Exit Wounds, I was unaware of the polygamy cults that inhabit the &quot;strip&quot; on the Arizona/Utah border. It was weird that I read the book and then heard a story on the news about that same subject!<br />The story held my interest all the way through and I liked the way she drew the characters.

This one I checked out of the library and it is a good thing I did not buy it. Though I can say I enjoyed reading most of it, it just seemed like she had to pull a bunch of chapters together, link them somehow, and make it a story. Maybe she was pressured after finishing her Jack The Ripper book, I don't know. I just felt strongly enough about this book to say my piece because she is capable of so much better. If you get a chance, read all of her other books but save this one for when you are desperate or just plain bored... then again this might not be an appropriate cure for boredom unless you have a high tolerance level like I do.	2004-03-07

I've known about this book for some time but it just showed up at Wal-Mart Christmas week (never saw it any place else). Anxious to read it, I've been a big fan of Mr. Largent since I read The Lake. At first I was reluctant to try the T.C. Bogner books but found I liked them after reading Red Ice. In this one, the story moves well and I like all the references to Turkey and the Turkish language. Since I lived in Turkey for 5 years, I can relate to a lot of the Turkish references he makes in the story. But I also found a few glaring misspellings that I am sure are merely typos the editor did not catch because he or she wouldn't know the difference in the first place! But there was one major technical error the editor should have caught and it had to do with the size of the bad guy's compound. I do not fault Mr. Largent as much for that as I am a writer also, and when you read and reread your work so many times, you tend to miss things that a second set of eyes should catch. There were also a few regular misspellings too (non-Turkish).<br />The reason I gave this work a 4 is for the technical errors/misspellings. Otherwise, I loved the story and found it quite engaging. The only other thing I didn't like was one of the characters that died in the end. I really wished the guy (let's just say a foreigner) had survived.<br />Great story, Mr. Largent. Time to kick your editor in the... well... never mind.	2003-12-29

I love the way he weaves lots of technical information into the story. The pace is good and I even liked the romantic twist he threw in this time. I am not much for romance in my reading but did not mind it in this case. I guess it ads depth to the character.<br />A little romance never stopped me from reading Clive Cussler either!<br />A great action/adventure story!	2003-12-23

I originally bought this book because I liked the cover and the blurb on the back sounded interesting. I was quite surprised at how good it was. From that point on, I searched high and low for her books and now have the complete set. The story gives the reader a good feel for what Nevada is really like when you get away from Las Vegas, especially with the many mining towns that are scattered throughout the state. Great characters, high suspense, and a plot that kept me guessing right until the end. This book is now out in electronic form and is well worth it if you cannot get the paperback.

I was often reminded of Jim Jones and the Heaven's Gate cult when I read this story. Some people can become so consumed with their religion that they would result to... well I don't want to spoil the story. Scott weaves a very frightening tale of how a group of people are taken in by a sinister preacher. They attend his services out of guilt, religious fervor, or whatever. Some people and see through this and try to stop things and that is what makes the story so good. You get inside the heads of each character and why they believe the way they do. A very good tale for a rainy day!	2003-12-01

This one was a real gem! It has been a long time since I read it, but if I remember correctly, this was actually her first novel as Elizabeth Forrest. It has it all, interesting characters, a great icky bug, and takes place in and around LA. I especially like the La Brea Tar Pits locale. Nowadays, it is becoming harder and harder to find good icky bug because apparently publishers do not think it will sell any more. This out of print book is an excellent introduction to good ole' monster stories and I highly recommend seeking it out.	2003-11-24

Mr. Little may be accused of following a formula, but that is exactly why I read every one of his books! No different than Clive Cussler for example, or the rock band AC/DC. You know what you're getting!<br />I love the way he gradually increases the perversion of the insurance salesman and his weird policies. And I love the heroes and their fight against the insurance agent. Bentley is good at adding perverted twists to the bad guys a little at a time and I'll just about bet that he has had a bad experience or two with insurance. Like he did with homeowners associations in The Association, he hits on a rather sensitive and somewhat true example of our American society. It seems we need insurance for just about everything and he takes that need to the extreme. Makes you wonder what all that fine print really says on your insurance policies! Well done!	2003-10-06

I am a big fan of \\"icky bug\\" (monster) stories and this one is right up there with the best. To sum it up, icky bug from space lands on earth in North Carolina, a bunch of hillbillies get et' by it, then the icky bug gets it's just deserts. My requirement for a good horror story is that the icky bug eats half the characters, there is lots of sex, and there is a liberal use of \\"colorful metaphors.\\" This book has it all. I'm being a little facetious but you get the point.<br />I will not go into the actual story line here but after a few chapters you can just see these people and their lives unfolding as the monster grows in strength. After living in West Virginia, I can well relate to the images of an old hillbilly living out in the woods, sittin' on the porch, swiggin' moonsine, with the old dawg too lazy to even wag his tail. The image may be exaggerated a little but this type of life still exists in the backwoods of the Appalachian states.<br />Well drawn characters, good icky bug, moved along real well. For those of you interested in good ole' fun reading, this is the book for you.	2003-09-22

I am a struggling writer so it is hard for me to criticize another, but I really don't understand how he was able to get away with virtually everything I can't, and get published in hardcover to boot. I read the first four chapters and did not know what I just read. I finally forced myself to get into the book and actually finished it. When I reached the ending, I had to go huh? As I think back on the book, I can see that there was a really great story in there somewhere. Mr. Searcey has a talent for making you taste the dust, and smell the weeds in East Texas and some of his descriptions are just awesome. But, he writes in a style that is very hard to take. I have to say that reading his book was a chore. If this is &quot;literary&quot; horror, I know what to avoid. I almost sent this book back to the book club twice, but stuck it out and despite everything, I am still glad I did. Mr. Searcey, I wish you the best with the &quot;intellectual&quot; crowd.	2003-04-22
