Erin Winslow who grew up in Africa searches for something more in her life.  The character of Stephen is more of a plot device than an actual character, but Quaid is strong and well worth reading about.  I would have liked more in depth about his struggle with alcohol though.  Morris has finally learned to get the reader interested in the next book by introducing characters in this one.  Amelia is an intriguing character and I looked forward to reading the next book in the series that focussed on her and her brother.	2005-10-06

Amelia as a woman who loves her family but can't help rebelling against them and God is like so many people.  Phil's growing relationship with the Morino family is a little farfetched, but enjoyable.  It was good that Morris handled the family evenly, it's too easy to make them a caricature.  He still has the odd habit of overdescribing character's outfits, especially in odd places.  I'm looking forward to the next book in the series.	2005-10-06

Uncle Ward's ride to the rescue was cut a little too close to feel real and much of the book was about the troubles of Templeton.  There was less focus in this book on the girls who live in the house and more on the uncles.  I was also uncomfortable with Mayme relating events she and Katie never witnessed, a plot device not used in previous books.  However, the book is still very readable and if you've read the rest of the series, you don't want to miss this book.  Katie and Mayme are growing up and it shows.  I'm a bit sad that there are no more in the series.  I will miss reading about the cousins and the rest of their family.	2005-10-04

It's a study of Captain Cook's voyages across the Pacific, along with an indepth character study of Cook and an updated look at the places he visited as Horwitz travels in his wake.  Although the language gets a bit foul at times, Horwitz does a terrific job of showing the argument between making Cook a hero and a scoundrel.  He looks into and relates the deep felt feelings on both sides and tries to get to the root of the anger felt toward him.  Horwitz makes some deeply insightful comments about white colonialism and the effects it has left on the indigenous cultures it dominated around the world.  Horwitz is thoroughly readable and entertaining while being scholarly and wise all at the same time.	2005-10-04

But as I continued to read, I was drawn into this story about a man's quest to find the Anti-Christ and stop his rise to power.  There's so many books and movies on the market about end times, and the message of this book resonates strongly in the current climate of looking for the apocalypse:  Don't go looking for signs of the Anti-Christ or the end of the world, but live your life for Christ and tell others about Him and His love.  Claudia's growth as a woman is wonderful to read, and her relationship with Asher speaks volumes.  There were a few cardboard characters, and the issue of Kirsten's accident was never addressed, but overall this is a great book.	2005-10-04

In fact, the two most unsympathetic characters are \\"good\\" Christians in this book, showing that Rivers has little bias.  The writing is impeccable and the characters strong and three-dimensional.  I felt that Dynah lost a little of her depth after she finally makes her decision, but I think that's due to the focus on other characters.  Ultimately, this is a story about hope and how the Lord can take horrible things and make them into good and bring healing to so many.  Rivers has a great ear for writing our inner dialogue with God.  When we yell at him, accuse him, and beg him for mercy, she's got it all down.	2005-10-04

It's a fun, if sadistic, look at just how dumb people can be.  It's also great for adding funny stories to your repertoire.

She gives thorough biographies of not just Anne, but her father and her accusers.  By giving the reader an understanding of all the players in this drama, Anne's tale is even more powerful.  Toward the end of her hearing, you almost want to put your hand over Anne's mouth to stop her lambast of her judges, but at the same time you can't help admiring her courage.  The solidity of the early pages dwindles off toward the end, through no fault of LaPlante, because of the paucity of records regarding Anne's last years, we can only get a sketchy outline of her exile.  That outline feels like even less because of the fully fleshed out Anne of early in the book.	2005-09-28

Her characterizations are never lazy or weak and her descriptions are deeply moving.  The story of Diana seeking her son is extremely relevant in today's political climate.  Hunt does a terrific job of researching her subject matter and giving strong debate on both sides.  Diana's descent was a little creepy at times, but that's deliberate on Hunt's part.  Sometimes we can be equally as guilty of insisting on our way instead of the Lord's way in things.  I bawled through the first seventy pages of this book, and spent the rest of it thinking and thanking God for what I have.	2005-09-25

Together Katie, Mayme, Emma, and Aleta are doing well running the plantation until men after Uncle Ward's gold interfere.  The writing was again powerful and moving.  I love the relationship between all of the girls, because it was well developed and rich.  I was a little disappointed in a certain plot device I won't specifically name for spoilers sake.  It seemed a bit of a stretch, although Mayme's reaction to it was amazing, and something I had never thought of before.  I was also glad to see that Phillips didn't give in to another plot device by killing Uncle Templeton.  I'm very curious to see how the next book will be with the additional of an adult to the household, plus the interference of another uncle.  Henry is a powerful character that I enjoy reading about, but I don't believe that I ever saw Mayme tell Henry and Jeremiah about her ancestry.  Their reactions were missing in an otherwise strong book.	2005-09-25

She's been throwing supernatural elements into them for years trying to make up for it, but they just aren't as good.  Not to say that they are bad, but go back and read some of the early books in her catalog for great repartee, fiesty heroines and heroes worth swooning over.  This book had wonderful characters.  Ford and his family are definitely worth reading about.  Jackie's fun, but sometimes it seemed as though she was condescending in her thoughts about other women.  The story, the build-up, the setting are terrific, and I enjoyed every minute of it, until the end.  Deveraux had given such a strong build-up to the mystery behind the story, that it was a let down to find out what was really going on.  C'mon, how clueless are the people in the town really?  Her name is Jackie for crying out loud!  And what happens if they tried to WALK away from town?  Too many unanswered questions, and yet the answer at the end was too pat.  Deveraux knows how to write great characters, I just wish that she'd go back to doing what she does best.	2005-09-23

As Mayme and Katie try to make their way in a strange new world of the Reconstruction South without adults, they also need to take care of Emma, her son William, and little Aleta.  Their love for each other and the Lord resonates through each page.  Phillips has a great voice for these girls and the way they struggle through each day.  This is a series I'm hooked on.	2005-09-21

The issues raised between being a Christian and being a follower of Christ are powerful.  Hunt does a wonderful job of capturing the quest of perfection that so many Christians are on, only to forget that we are sinners too, and to be surprised by the sin we find in the world.  Emma is a true 3-dimensional character who I would love to know in real life, and I will miss her now that the book is done.  It's a great inside look at the life of a televangelist and the missteps even they take on the way.  But most of all, this is a powerfully moving story of a mother, her son, and what they teach each other about faith and the Lord.	2005-09-20

His detailed descriptions bring to life foreign scenes in a way few others can.  He dialogue and rapport with people all over the world make for great anecdotes and deeply moving stories.  He provides a rich and powerful account of life pre-Gulf War in the Arab world.  Although much of this information is probably outdated today, I would love to read a follow-up by Horwitz about how it has changed.

It's short and sweet, but sometimes the rush through the years felt hurried.  I loved the characters of Juno and Jacob and would enjoy reading further books involving them and their unusual/usual marriage.  Unfortunately Mai is a bit dumb and that leads to a frustrating lack of empathy for her.  Zhenia is a strong character, but only in the last few pages do we get a view of her inner mind and start to understand her motivations.  I feel a bit let down now that I've finished it.

This book has a lot to say about forgiveness and hard hearts.  The Christian theme in this book isn't as preachy as in the last few, and the powerful message that God can change anyone is emphasized over and over.  The only disappointment was that the bad guys didn't \\"get theirs\\", but I guess that is true to life.  Great love story, strong characters, enjoyable plot.	2005-09-19

They have strong voices and seem to true to life, it's hard to believe that this is fiction, and a man writing these two young girls!  I couldn't help but fall in love with Mayme.  Her wise but innocent voice sings throughout the entire book.  I love the relationship both girls develop with the Lord in the book.  It proves that He can and will reach out to anyone who's willing to listen.  Another wonderful thing about this book is its ability to be read by a wide range of readers.  My junior high daughter can read this book without me worrying about what she's reading.  The themes are mature, but they are handled in a way that it appropriate for junior high to adult readers.  I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.  If all Christian fiction was this good, it would fly off of the shelves!	2005-09-19

Obviously something happened between the two of them, but it is never explained.  Annie seems like a caricature, as does Jeanine.

If Morris wants to add to the tree, he should do so in a way that doesn't feel forced.  None of the characters in this one are well rounded, and some are so cliched it's painful.  You just know when the previously undeveloped soldier mentions a fiancee he's going to die within two pages.  The same with the unsaved soldier who suddenly finds Christ and starts evangelizing.  I enjoy much of Morris' work, but this is the kind of work that gives Christian fiction a bad name.  If you like the House of Winslow series, you can safely skip this one.  Morris also seems to be having minor characters use the exact same quotes about trivial things in the books, i.e. wanting a conversion experience with twenty car-wrecks.  In both this book and the previous characters use the EXACT same lines.  Skip this one, the next one is much better!	2005-09-19

Lippman does a terrific job of getting into the heads of a variety of people, an insecure seventeen year-old, a middle-aged police officer, a twenty-something women in a dead end job, etc.  She did a great job holding out the suspense until the very end of the novel, but I felt a little blindsided by the results.

Unlike many novels today, it actually has likable characters that I enjoyed spending time with and will miss now that I've finished it.  Martin's descriptions are powerful and full of depth.  The title has several meanings that come gradually through reading.  This isn't a book with lots of action or suspense.  It's a book about true life with real people where sometimes the most dramatic things are the truest.  I wish I knew a Mama Ella.  Mutt's dream is possibly the most beautiful thing I've ever read.

The Big Over Easy is so packed with interesting characters and tidbits, it's obvious that Fforde will be writing for these characters again.  Unfortunately it felt like he crammed so much in the book that at times I felt a bit overwhelmed.  There are many plays on words in inside jokes, but sometimes they also overwhelmed the writing in that I spent so much time trying to figure them out, that I couldn't enjoy the story as much I would have like to.  Fforde is a genuis and has really made reading fun.  I look forward to every one of his books, and this one is no exception.  Minus the few caveats I gave earlier, this book makes some wry observations about society's obsession with the media, forensic science, and crime.  Jack Spratt is a character I look forward to reading more about, and I was pleased that Mary Mary rose above my expectations as well.  You can't check your brain at the door for this one!	2005-09-05

It's kind of like reading Lee Strobel's Case for Faith and Case for Christ in extreme abbreviated format. I am a believer, and this book is perfect for coming up with arguments for people who take a stand in opposition to mine, but I don't know if it would make THEM believe any differently.  There were a couple of points in the book that I was unfamiliar with and was glad to read:  that if God is in me, he will love my spouse even when I am unable to, that the Trinity is truly beyond my understanding so it's ok if I don't get it.  There is definite value in this book for believers, but I'm afraid for non-believers this would fall of deaf ears.  Maybe not, the Lord has the power to do amazing things.	2005-09-05

Noach (Noah) is anguished and struggles with  the death of children in the flood.  The scenes of the people on the outside struggling and fighting to get in are horrific.  While not strictly Scriptural, and there are a couple of elements I was uncomfortable with (Re Jana & Neelata's relationship) ultimately even Re Jana comes to believe in Noach's Unnameable god as a god who will protect her and she can abide in.

Trying to fit three stories into one book seems to make all of them a bit too shallow.  I never bought Esther's nickname as the Iron Lady.  Even in the beginning of the book she didn't seem as hard as the characters said she was.  I loved the character of Esther and her relationship with Jan.  Ruth and Dr. Burns were enjoyable to read about as well.  I don't enjoy Morris cramming a whole list of current events into each book.  They seem out of place at times.

I was surprised at the depth Morris was able to give to them.  Priscilla and Jason's story was still too shallow.  It went in jumps and gaps, so the end result was a little unbelievable, especially her decision about show business. Peter, Easy, and Jolie are wonderful to read about.  Their chemistry works terrifically, and I really enjoy their relationship.  The real caveat about this book is too many descriptions about characters' clothing, and sometimes in the oddest of places.  I don't need a complete description of their wardrobe every time they show up, save it for special outfits, and certainly not interjected in the middle of an emotional reunion!

Unfortunately it makes both of them unlikable and hard to sympathize with.  The ease with which Vera's identity is stolen and her credit destroyed is terrifying, but it's also frightening to think that this book could be used as an instruction manual for any wannabe identity thief.  Shute is terrific at writing out Vera's innermost thoughts, but she does so in a way that no one should ever be exposed, but perhaps that was her intention.  The ending was disappointing to say the least.  As the reader I wanted more anger from Vera.  Perhaps the biggest flaw in the book is that Shute chose a poor character to be the protagonist.	2005-08-22

Rather than advance the plot there is too much focus on the rather disgusting toileting habits of the main character's flatmates.
