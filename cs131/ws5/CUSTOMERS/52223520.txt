Back in 1994, I remember hearing about problems in some far away African country; killings, refugees, camps. I just didn't pay too close attention to what was happening, so embroiled in the drama of my own life. As it is with most stories, things come and go, and soon, the little country of Rwanda, where so much horror and travesty happened, became a distant memory. It is precisely this reason why books like \\"We Wish to Inform You...\\" and movies like \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" need to be read and seen, so that the horrors are brought to light and understood by people like me.<br /><br />\\"We Wish to Inform You...\\" is an amazing book by Philip Gourevitch, who details the genocide in Rwanda, the history leading up to it, and the aftermath of the bloodbath. Gourevitch's strategy is to tell a fairly complex story through the eyes of its survivors, which makes for some very compelling reading. Dr. Odette Nyiramilimo, Paul Rusesabagina, and others, tell what they saw, heard, and survived with during these terrible times. Their first hand accounts bring an immediacy and a deeply personal impact to the book.<br /><br />By interviews with other important Rwandas, generals and members of the clergy, Gourvevitch attempts to uncover and discover the sournce of blame for the atrocities. From visiting a church that honors those killed, to visiting the camps that held many Hutu fugtives, Gourevitch's book is complete and intense. He manages, without overstatement or aggrandizement, to bring the horror of the genocide alive.<br /><br />A million Rwandan's turned on each other and committed massive crimes on each other and humanity, while the world watched. Teachers killed students in their classrooms, while the US Government debated the definition of the word \\"genocide\\". Priests trapped thousands of congregants in their churches and had them slaughtered, while the UN debated what to do. Hundreds of thousands of bodies were dumped into rivers, while the world did nothing. This book brings to light not only the travesty of Rwanda, but also, the travesty of the world's indifference.to light not only the travesty of Rwanda, but also, the travesty of the world's indifference.	2005-08-19

Eventually turning into the legend of Dracula, many books and films have grandized the legend into almost a campy-like quality. First time novelist Elizabeth Kostova's impressive book, \\"The Historian\\", is a fictional fantasy that succeeds in bringing the Dracula legend back to its roots, and in doing so, provides an absolutely chilling story.<br /><br />Told through the eyes of a sixteen year old girl, letters from her father, and many other letters, the story unfolds quickly and dramatically as she discovers a book in her father's library with a dragon in it. Her father then begins to explain the book, and in doing so, his fascination with Vlad the Impaler, later to be called Dracula. The story takes them all over Europe, in search of castles and mysteries.<br /><br />This book reminded me somewhat of The Da Vinci Code, only because it is a true page turner. Kostovo knows how to end a chapter that makes you immediately want to start reading the next chapter. Also, steeped in history, Kostovo uses facts to compel the fictional story well. In many cases, I wondered what was true in the story, and what was fictional, the line was successfully blurred. In any case, this book caused me to do much internet searching about Vlad himself, as well as Bulgaria, Wallachia, Budapest, Istanbul, et. al. I can see this book coming out in a new \\"illustrated\\" edition in a year's time, with pictures of all of these amazing places that Kostovo describes.<br /><br />Ultimately, however, this is a book that did give me bad dreams. Because it is so steeped in history, and built up so well, it's a terrifying read, and it might even make me think twice before going into libraries!	2005-08-12

Rowling's best	After spending all day reading this book, I have to say that the latest installment of the Harry Potter series is one of Rowling's best works. Whereas the last book, \\"Order of Phoenix\\" seemed to be too long and drawn out in some places, \\"Half-blood Prince\\" is better paced and shorter. Also gone, thankfully, is the screaming upset Harry Potter that we were subject to in 5. Harry has matured a bit, dealing with his destiny as well as being a teenager.<br /><br />Moments of light comedy are interspersed with moments of intense drama. It is clear that Rowling feels comfortable within her characters to take great risks with them, which pays off with a thrilling, riveting story, and setting up things well for the last book.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling has affording children and adults everywhere a compelling story and storyline, and opened the world of fantasy fiction to many people who would normally eschew such a genre. Perhaps Rowling herself is magic.... and if not, at least her writing is!	2005-07-16

For most plays of that era, the average reader tends to lose references and it tends to be stodgy and irrelevant. Not so Earnest, due to the brilliance and imagination of it's playwright.<br /><br />The Importance of Being Earnest is a tour de force of comedy, misidentifications, and farce. Algernon and Jack are friends, and each has invented an imaginary person as an excuse of getting out of engagements. Jack's person is Ernest, a brother with a wild past. The two conspire to woo the ladies that they love, and through a series of happenstances, must gently deceive to get want they want. The end result is a play of uncomperable quality, chock full of witticisms that are highly quotable out of context. In fact, I dare suggest the entire play is quotable, such its brilliance.<br /><br />Wilde pulled no punches when writing Earnest. Often, when a play is filled with memorable quotes, it takes away from the realism of the scenes because the characters then become merely conduits for the writer's intellect. Not so in Earnest. Wilde manages to make the characters say exactly what they would say in each situation, true to their persona. That alone is quite an accomplishment, one not often seen.<br /><br />Misidentities, witty banter, love, all conspire to one of English's most brilliant comedies ever to have seen the stage. We should be so lucky the world had Oscar Wilde in it, and even more so, that he wrote at all.	2005-07-14

Which makes his downfall all the more tragic, which is chronicled in this book of fiction, \\"I, Fatty\\" by Jerry Stahl.<br /><br />The Roscoe in this book is one driven by demons of youth. Beaten ferociously both mentally and physcially by a father, Roscoe is driven from his home as a means of survival. The death of his mother, and abandonment by his father cause Roscoe to find his life in theater and making people laugh. He meets people, which soon facilities his rise in vaudeville, then to movies. Around the age of 21, he has a career and a wife, and everything is set. But, as it must happen in this country, America just loves a big downfall, and Roscoe's occurs during a party one night in San Francisco.<br /><br />Told from Roscoe's first person narrative, naturally this tale would be one of exoneration. Throughout the trial, Roscoe maintained his innocence, and therefore, it seems natural that the book present his view of things, rather than a more rounded look at the trial. One thing Stahl does brilliantly is describe the public's reaction to the Arbuckle trial, and the horrible things that happened to him as a result of these people's actions. Another brilliant thing in this book is Stahl's description of Roscoe's drug addiction and the hell it played in his life.<br /><br />As Roscoe finds himself haunted through his life by the memories of his father, you find yourself equally as haunted. However, towards the end, there is no payoff for this journey, and very little resolution with his childhood. Perhaps it doesn't need to be there, for perhaps we never truly come to terms with our childhood memories, but still, as a literary device, the readers wants it to happen.<br /><br />Still, I, Fatty recounts a time in our cinematic history where it was all new and exciting, and works to restore the reputation of one of America's finest comedians. Whatever you may believe about Rocoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle, he is a still a brilliant comedian who deserves all the recognition warranted.one of America's finest comedians.

Fed by her faith, her ultimate belief that she was right in her convictions, and a determined spirit, Jean not only survived this perilous journey, but helped others survive it along the way. Sally Denton, Jean's great great granddaughter, recounts her relatives momnumental journey in the small and quiet book, \\"Faith and Betrayal\\".<br /><br />Using Jean Rio's diary as a record of account in this book, Denton reconstructs the history of her family, and the decision of Jean Rio to leave her life of priviledge in England to the great unknown. Starting off in luxury, Jean converts to Mormonism and decides her faith should bring her to America and Utah, as one of those brave pioneers. The rest of the story recounts Jean's life in Utah, her disillusionment with Mormonism, and her eventual resettling to California.<br /><br />Jean's trek across the United States would earn my five stars by itself. Denton's reconstruction of the journey of Jean and her entourage is compelling and amazing. I long since knew about the travels of Mormon pioneers, but never has the perilous journey been so wonderfully reconstructed. It was amazing to read of Jean's growth during the trip, finding skills she never knew she had. This is one pioneer woman who deserves her story to be told.<br /><br />Much has been and will be said about Denton's view on Mormonism, and her \\"obvioius bias\\" and several will discount her story by their \\"factual errors\\". Any book written that dares suggest that a religion, such as Mormonism, has faults, is bound to be attacked. It is almost tiresome that it happens, but alas, it is. At least Denton has said her peace, and has shared it in a wonderful book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this story for anyone who wants a intrguing story about a woman who had the courage to follow her convictions, and live her life based on her beliefs.ased on her beliefs.	2005-07-12

What's amazing about it is that the secret held for so many years, and despite several well intentioned attempts by many people, it was never truly cracked. And in Washington DC, of all places! At any rate, the revelation allowed Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein to finally talk publicly about a primary hidden source in their investigation, and thus, this book is born.<br /><br />The Secret Man is a small book, a different view of the path Bob Woodward used Mark Felt to help with the Watergate investigation. Whereas their book \\"All the President's Men\\" (which is quoted frequently in this book) is their definitive account of the investigation, this book fills in some of the holes, some of the behind the scenes that Woodward was unable to tell. That account, however brief, is still fascinating.<br /><br />Woodward describes how he established his relationship with Felt long ago one night in the White House, of all places. Through the years, a sort of clandestine friendship developed, and when it came time to investigate Watergate, Felt was willing to guide the young reporter through the maze of controversy. We learn more about their communication system, and even the location of the garage where they met (one which I've passed several times!). Woodward openly discussions information that he received that ended up being false or a dead end, which lends to a more complete picture.<br /><br />Much has been made of Felt's character when he \\"came out\\" of the Deep Throat closet, so to speak. It seems to me that the discussion about whether or not he was a \\"hero\\" or a \\"traitor\\" seems to be a diversionary smoke screen to the larger issue; that a President, so fearful about his opponents, would work to subvert justice in the name of retaining his office. It seems that old habits never die with some people.<br /><br />At any rate, The Secret Man is a short, brief journey back to a time in the early 1970's and forward, an insider's look at an incredible investigation, and the important role of sources newspaper reporting. The Watergate picture, although not totally, is a little more complete.brief journey back to a time in the early 1970's and forward, an insider's look at an incredible investigation, and the important role of sources newspaper reporting.

However, as this literary portrait emphasizes, there is much more to the justice than just what is written in his opinions; that understand his wise veneer lies a man conflicted, and a friendship in the balance.<br /><br />Author Linda Greenhouse takes us on a simple journey of one man's life, from his early years in Minnesota through his controversial decisions and famous dissents. Harry in the early years is one we all can relate to, somewhat befuddled by the course his life should take. Early on, his best friend Warren Burger, provided the strength and support Harry needed to make his journey into law. This friendship will become sorely tested when both Burger and Blackmun find themselves sitting on the Supreme Court.<br /><br />Taking advantage of the dearth of papers Blackmun left to the Library of Congress, Greenhouse then proceeds to describe in good detail the journey Blackmun took as associate justice. She covers several important cases, the most lengthy one of course, Roe v. Wade. Greenhouse sucessful navigates the careful legal waters of Roe, explaining some of the more heavier legal issues in terms for everyone to understand.<br /><br />We see Harry's personal thoughts about abortion (he was against it) conflict with his role of justice and interpreter of the Constitution. This happened again with his personal thoughts about the death penalty (he was against it), but would vote to support its use. How he manages such dichotomy is truly amazing, and lends itself to an insight on the inner workings of his character.<br /><br />Harry paper's, and thus this book, leads to an intriguing inside look at the workings of this \\"mysterious\\" branch of government. His kindness as he worked with the other justices is clearly evident, even those with which he virtually opposed in every ground. Letters from Rehnquist and Thomas lend to an enlightening of these mysterious characters, and soften their images a bit.<br /><br />Sadly, Blackmun's friendship with Burger doesn't stand the test of time. Soon, due to Burger's lack of leadership, and their increasing distance in juriprudence, the two would soon develop a rift that time would not heal. Publicly Blackmun would acknowledge the two's friendship as one that lasted 60 years. Privately, he felt distant towards Burger at the ends of their lives. One thinks if only they took a lesson from Adams and Jefferson, and would bury the hachet to find their friendship once again.<br /><br />By the end of the book, you get a warm sense of the man, and his mission in life: to bring justice to everyone.

Richard Greenberg walks a delicate but intriguing line in his play \\"Take Me Out\\". He tries to avoid cliches and stereotypes in a play that is all about cliches and stereotypes of all sorts. The end result is an intrguing, compelling, and often funny look at how baseball and in a larger sense, America, handled, is handling, or will handle her diversity.<br /><br />Take Me Out starts out about a talented gay baseball player, Darren Lemming of the ficitonal Empires,  who has already come out of the closet to his team and the world before the play begins. Instead of falling into the now thankfully tired cliche of the team and coach having to \\"deal\\" with Darren's sexuality, Greenberg allows the team to deal with the news quickly and move on with the story, including his literary and intelligent best friend Kippy, who narrates the play.<br /><br />Bring in Shane Mungitt, a relief pitcher who struggles to put two words intelligibly together, and in turn, revives the Empire's sagging baseball season. Through his gruffness and lack of communication, Shane clearly becomes the play's antagonist, and does so quite publicly and unintentionally, on television during an interview. Shane spouts off a quick string of prejudical labels that shock and dismay his team right at the end of act one. Of course, act two picks up with the team having to deal (or not deal) with Shane's obvious bigotry, which leads to a series of surprising and shocking events that somehow make sense in the larger sense of the play.<br /><br />Greenberg never allows his play to fall into a stereotypical trap of victimization. Throughout the play, Darren retains his leadership and assertiveness, and even publicly rebels against any sympathy garnered from the public by Shane's outburst. It's refreshing to read a gay character with a spine, who relies on no one but himself.<br /><br />However, almost as a comic relief, Greenberg imbued his play with one of the most memroable stage characters ever written, the incomperable Mason Marzac, who plays Darren's financial manager. Normally staid, boring, stiff, and uninteresting, Greenberg has turned this character on its ear by making him a nelly queen, and one of the most hilarious characters to boot. Almost immediately, Mason is the character that draws in the audience, and you love him for wearing his emotions on his sleeve. Even more amazing, Mason becomes a baseball convert, and drags the audience into understanding why people love baseball, or even its grander meaning in American society. How rich!<br /><br />Take Me Out is an incredible play for many reasons, and I highly recommend reading it, or if you are lucky enough to be near a local or national production of the play, see it.

It is so richly layered, and exquisite, that the story unfolding onto each other in a brilliiant and insightful way, leading to gentle tears.<br /><br />Composed of a series of short stories, McCann reflects upon his childhood in Maryland and produces some grand, quiet stories which represent it. It may be surprising to some to note that this book is a work of fiction; McCann claims to have a lot in common with his narrator, but is not the narrator himself. In reading the stories, he has so fully inhabited the character that he revelation is completely surprising and wonderful.<br /><br />Each chapter is a short story, when read together, compose an entire book that can be easily digested in one sitting. But don't fall to temptation. There are entire sections of McCann's novel that beg to be read, and re-read, and cherished as a fine wine or a rich dessert. A quick read through merely only gives you a sense of the events; a more deliberate read allows you to savor his words, the fragrant poetry of carefully chosen lyrical sentences, and the rich characters whom he portrays.  In fact, McCann's writing reflects well upon another current author who is an equal craftman with the lexicon: Michael Cunninham, who gives a generous and kind review of the novel himself. If you love Michael's prose, then you will love Richard's as well.<br /><br />McCann claims it took 17 years to produce this work. Let's hope his next book isn't that long in the coming.	2005-06-29

From his stunning comprehensive book \\"Flesh and Blood\\" to what I believe one of the best books ever written, \\"The Hours\\", Cunningham's great literary gift is his careful use of words; i.e. making the words work for him, instead of he working for the words. Such is the case with his latest book, \\"Specimen Days\\", just recently released.<br /><br />A compendium of three stories, like the Hours, Specimen Days tells three separate stories in three separate times, and like the Hours, they are interconnected. The first story is one of an industrailized New York, where machinery rules, and a young boy copes with life and death, and his infinite knowledge of Walt Whitman. The second story takes place in modern New York, as a black psychologist deals with terrorism in today's age. The third story zips along to a futuristic New York, with a trio of futuristic entities as they make their way through this world.<br /><br />Whereas the Hours has clear and amazing connections, the reader must work more for the connections in this book, however, they are there. The most obvious one is Cunningham's use of essentially the same three characters in each story, continuining along with their own stories, There are more subtle and rich connections, and they are worth the discovery.<br /><br />However, the thing I am most impressed about with this book is Cunningham's writing. There is a scene in the first story that exemplifies his writing style, and the beauty of his words. Lucas, a deformed adolscent, is sent on a mini-quest by none other than Walt Whitman, and Lucas finds himself in Central Park at the Bethesda fountain. As Lucas peers beyond the angels hands, he sees the impressive starlight, never having seen it before. The scene was so moving, with each word chosen exactly right, that I read it over and over again, to relive the experience created by Cunningham. For that alone, this book is worth the journey.<br /><br />It may be another few years before we get treated to another Cunningham book, but let me tell you, it is definitely worth the wait.ourney. <br /> <br />It may be another few years before we get treated to another Cunningham book, but let me tell you, it is definitely worth the wait.	2005-06-10

After discovering him at a hospital, and spending time with his company, Whitman decided to live in Washington DC. His sojourn there, which last many years, is brilliantly recounted in the simple book \\"Memoranda During the War\\".<br /><br />While working at the Patent Office during the war, Whitman volunteered much time caring and tending the wounded at the many Civil War hospitals that sprang up to take care of the men. Whitman would bring the men simple treats, such as fruit, or paper, or things to read, and spend hours tending to these brave men. This book is a recollection, however brief, of those times he spent caring for the men, including some important events of the time.<br /><br />While people learn about the history of the Civil War by memorizing dates and places, they often miss the impact of the Civil War. Whitman's book brings the impact of this war into real contexts. Even he, in his writing, says that the true reality of this war may be unknowable to those who would never see it. Whitman attempts to correct this by telling stories of the wounded soldiers he tends; stories of battles; and a particularly gruesome story of a raid gone bad and its horrific consequences.<br /><br />Whitman's prose is succinct and touching. The few soldier's lives he manages to capture on paper, some in just a few sentences, are compelling. Anyone wanting to understand this war certainly should spend an hour with Whitman as he describes his small part in this grand conflict, for with his words, comes a grander understanding of this war.	2005-04-24

During the last few years of his life, the great gray poet Walt Whitman was visited by a devoted young man by the name of Horace Traubel. They would converse about all topics in the world, after which, Traubel would busily scribe down notes from these meetings. His plan? To create a living testament to Walt's life, his sayings, viewpoints, and eventually, to get closer to the poet than ever possible.<br /><br />Eventually published in nine volumes, the last finally being completed in the 1980's, is an immense, thick work. Professor and Whitman scholar Gary Schmidgall has taken the essence of those nine volumes, and \\"boiled them down\\" in an approachable book called \\"Intimate with Walt\\".<br /><br />Schmidgall brilliantly organizes his excerpts from these nine volumes into categories, which means you can dance through the book and find areas that interest you the most. Want to learn about Walt's family? It's there. How about Walt's thoughts on his Leaves of Grass? It's there. Incredibly moving is a recounting of Walt's last days, and Traubel's reaction to them. We can be in the room as the great gray poet passes; it's incredibly moving and touching.<br /><br />Many biographies have been written about this man, but few tend to get as close to Whitman as this book does. I highly recommend this book for Whitman scholars, fellow poets, or anyone wanting to spend a few quiet moments with this great man.	2005-04-05

She delivers her promise in her new tome. Vowell, a self-avowed history nut, decides to drag certain hapless aquaintances around the places associated with three presidential assassinations: Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley.<br /><br />Along the way, she shares information she has researched or learned, which makes this book one of her more scholarly, if that word could ever be applied here. She actually makes history more palpable, more real for people to digest in an entertaining way. How many of us would desire reading a book about the famed assassin Leon Cgolgosz? Put Vowell's name on the cover, slap a salty title on the book, and bang, we're lining up book-in-hand to purchase it. (Oh, and by the way, Vowell finally deciphers the mystery of pronouncing Cgolgosz, which is.... is... hmmm, I suddenly can't remember).<br /><br />Whenever you read a piece by Vowell, invariably, you never read it in your own voice, but her Sarah's voice ringing through, or was it Violet Parr from the Incredibles... oh wait, it's the SAME person). I guess that's the mark of a good writer, that she has developed her own style strong enough for us to hear her reading it to us. At any rate, this history nut who also goes ballistic whenever he comes across a plaque, gives this book five stars for a truly enjoyable read from a truly enjoyqable writer.	2005-03-29

Much of the later editions of the book become watered down and less potent, according to editor Gary Schmidgall, of which I heartily agree. The final \\"deathbed\\" edition of Leaves of Grass, released around the time of Whit's death, varies tremendously from the rich dance of the first edition, in fact, the first three editions.<br /><br />After reading Schmidgall's amazing book, \\"Walt Whitman: A Gay Life\\", you come quickly appreciate Whitman's 1860 edition of the book, the third, released just before the Civil War. Upon searching for a copy of this book, it's virtually hard to find, and I ended up downloading some of the poetry off the Whitman archives website. But Schmidgall painstakingly has recreated that edition, rebuilding such moving sections of the book like Calamus.<br /><br />It's in Schmidgall's edition that the true genius of Whitman comes alive. He becomes more real, more in depth, and shows more pain than in any other edition I've read. It's too bad that Whit decided to censor his writings as he aged, for he tends to weed out the roses with the dandelions. Schmidgall replants Whitman's glorious garden, and we, as readers, get to reap the visual brilliance of it all.	2005-03-27

One of the things that people often do is to take their heroes and try to see within that person themselves. It's only natural. It's through someone else's greatness that we experience it, and often, find our own. So it's not surprising that many Whitman biographers have passively denied Whitman's homosexuality, or out right refuted it. It's also not surprising that Gary Schmidgall takes a different view, and sees Whitman through the eyes of a gay man, writing an impressive, passioned look at Whitman's life called \\"Walt Whitman: A Gay Life\\".<br /><br />Based on a look on Whitman's poetry, letters, and other sources, Schmidgall tells a tale of a gay Whitman. This isn't a biography, however, which Scmidgall admits right away. His book attempts to describe Whitman during different phases in his life, particularly important ones that would have shaped his gay identity. Therefore, the focus is not broad across the span of Whitman's many years, but very intensely focused specific times, for example, Whitman as an opera lover.<br /><br />Schmidgall admits upfront the task before him which is enormous; being that in all of Whitman's known correspondances, interviews, archival evidence, details on his sexuality and sex life is scanity at best. We have no big true confessional, and when asked directly about the sexual content of \\"Leaves of Grass\\", his pat answer is to let the work speak for itself. However, Schmidgall does an awesome job reconstructing Whitman, looking at everything through the eyes of a gay man, bringing the poet alive much more than other biographies which I've read.Schmidgall liberally uses the words like \\"imagine, think, suppose\\" when talking about his points, but you forgive him. The task is daunting, but well done.<br /><br />Whitman is alive in this book as he never has been before. Whereas more scholarly books fail to adequately persue Whitman's sexuality, this one brings it alive, and therefore, brings Whitman alive in a wonderful sense. You can almost hear the poet chuckling in the background as you read some of the passages. Whatever the effect, Whitman has been drawn closer to my heart because of this book, and I highly recommend it.n almost hear the poet chuckling in the background as you read some of the passages.

On the surface, it would seem to everyone that Martha Beck had it all: a great marriage, a sucessful career, several degrees, a Harvard education, and kids. Upon the birth of her son Adam, and her relocation to Provo, Utah, a different Martha emerged, most surprisingly to Martha herself. This is her story, recounted in the intriguing, introspective book \\"Leaving the Saints\\".<br /><br />Martha Beck, a columnist for O magazine, and a current trendy \\"life coach\\", has the soul of a writer, and the ability to reflect upon her personal history with wry wit and intellect. She grew up the daughter of a famed Mormon apologist, not known outside of LDS circles, and lived the \\"celebrity\\" status commissioned to her because of her father's work. However, all was not happy in the \\"ocean blue\\" house of her childhood. It isn't until she moves back to Utah, to have her family and community help her care for her son Adam, who has Down's syndrome, that a floodgate of memories opens up for her, leading her on an unimaginable journey of discovery and horror.<br /><br />Beck writes about this with panache and honesty, sometimes even inserting a little joke or pun in an situation that I was finding not the least bit funny. It's Beck's way of making us more at ease in a clearly uncomfortable situation. Her writing is brisk and fresh, never dwelling on a particular memory for too long, allowing us to see her progression in dealing with the developments. She also writes this book in a \\"tennis fashion\\" bouncing back and forth between the present, where she is confronting her father over her memories, and the past as she recalls them.<br /><br />I can see how members of the LDS community won't appreciate or enjoy this book. Beck manages to paint a somewhat compassionate picture of her follow Mormons, many of whom come across as sincerely helpful and desirous to support Martha. Beck doesn't dwell on the more intrgiuing aspects of the Mormon religion, writing about them without going into too many details. Yet, the LDS community as a whole comes under siege as very patriarchal, and very controlling, which I can see ruffling the feathers of the members of this religion.<br /><br />However, Beck's recounting is just too mesmerizing to discount, too truthful to put down, and too impactful to deny. What happened to Martha happens to many of our girl's today, in all religions and all faiths, and we, as a nation, need to take steps to ensure that Martha's story doesn't get repeated. This must be our mission, and let us allow Martha Beck's story to lead the charge.too many details.

Going against prescribed form of the time, Whitman fashioned himself a style of poetry unto itself, brash, fresh, untamed. Such words can be used to descirbe this stunning, and I mean absolutely stunning, children's book on the life of Walt Whitman, by Barbara Kerley, illustrated by Brian Selznick.<br /><br />Never before have I seen a celebration of a poet's life done so wonderfully. It manages to capture the beautiful essence of the man, while explaining to children in an easy to understand manner. The life of Walt comes alive, from his childhood to the very last years of his life, and the text is peppered with awesome quotes from some of his most famous poems.<br /><br />Particularly amazing his how Kerley describes Walt's selfless love of the Civl War soldiers whom he tended in Washington DC hospitals. His actions during this time show the depth of feeling he had for these poor boys, and children will respond with their innate sense of empathy towards Walt.<br /><br />The text is amazing, and the pictures equal it. Selznick has illustrated Walt in all stages of his life, from child to the wizened old man we've all come to associate with him. Selznick's pictures are honest and endearing, again, those that relate to Walt's caring of the soldiers. Even using type similiar to that Walt would have used in his earlier typesetting days, the pictures support and extend the text timelessly.<br /><br />It's been amazing that within the last few years, a spate of books celebrating our nation's most beloved poets are coming to fruition. It's about time. Our youth need to hear the voices of these people... Langston Hughes... Emily Dickinson... and now Walt Whitman, not only to instill a sense of pride with the country that they live, but also, within the sense of pride within themselves. This book will serve as a benchmark for these books in years to come.come.	2005-03-01

Reflective of his Midwestern origins, his poetry is lyrical and simple, beautiful and stunning. Just pick up any of one of his many books, and delve into his works to appreciate why he has earned this national honor. Kooser, teacher that he is, has responded in kind, and written for us a wonderful manual on the art of writing poetry, \\"The Poetry Home Repair Manual\\".<br /><br />The subtitle of this work is \\"Practical Advice for Beginning Poets\\", but I daresay this book can be a guide for anyone interested in the art of poetry. I myself have dabbled in poetry since high school years, and I found this guide insightful. It allowed me to reflect upon my own work, illuminating what I've been doing well and supporting change in other areas. It also ignited a renewed interest in writing poetry, which had fallen off since a recent foray into screenwriting.<br /><br />Kooser writes this non-fiction book like a poet would. There are some absolutely beautiful images that Koosher paints to elaborate his points. He describes the first few lines of a poem as an invitation to a houseguest, which we welcome into the poem for a short stay. These, and others, are indelible images that you can retain as you write.<br /><br />Also, fortunately, Koosher shies away from long, arduous explanations on the mechanics of writing poetry. One of the ways to turn people off quicker to this writing is to demand an understanding of meter and rhyme. Koosher's discussion is quick and painless, kuch like tearing off a band-aid. He suggests focusing on emotions and memories, yet talks about the mechanics as a way to bring it to your awareness.<br /><br />Kooser has given us a gift in this book. His inital discussion in the book about making poetry understandable is right on. So much of poetry is lost on the masses because the context of the poetry is lost on the reader. You know you should understand the poem, and appreciate it, but in reality, it's way beyond anyone besides scholars..

Saving hundred of slaves, showing them their paths to life in Canada, risking her own life for that of others. She's a national heroine, and a national treasure, yet how many of us know anything about her? Catherine Clinton's book is an attempt to get closer to this intentionally illusive conductor, and she does it with grace and aplomb.<br /><br />Drawing on as many resources as possible, Clinton pastes together a narrative of the life of this amazing woman. The task is formidable. The Underground Railroad, of which Tubman spent many years of her life serving, was one meant to be secretive. This secrecy ensured its survival, both of the people who worked in it, and those who survived because of it. Very few records exist, and Clinton finds as many as possible. Plus, as Tubman starts out as \\"property\\", her early existence wasn't notable enough to record. Clinton does a very credible job in building her narrative with little information.<br /><br />As Tubman progresses into her most dangerous years, the tension rises. It's nearly impossible to separate the woman from the movement, and thus, talking about the mechanics of the Underground Railroad is helping us understand Tubman. As you read, how amazing this woman is comes clear: an illiterate, uneducated woman defying odds and leading people to freedom. It's compelling, and it's true.<br /><br />Clinton thankfully doesn't draw out the end of Tubman's life, drawing her amazing experience to a close as she gracefully ages into her final years.  Her  message of reliance, and perserverence, is one to teach all of the children. Clinton claims at the end of her book a desire to \\"rescue\\" Tubman from elementary schools and introduce her to adults. That's great, but let's leave her in school too, to guide, inspire, and teach our children that one person truly does make a difference in so many lives.	2005-02-22

His treatise on civil disobidience is a hallmark of progressive action today. Upset that his government declared an unjust war, Thoreau refuses to pay taxes to show his digust, which lands him one lauded night in jail. Thus is the basis for this extremely inventive, timely play \\"The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail\\".<br /><br />Not just a night in jail, but a brave overview Thoreau's life ensues, showing snippets of his events, meetings, and philosophies that were so critical to the development of his transcendentalism. This isn't a dry biography, however. The authors weave a Thoreau that is a rich tapestry of thought and action. He is both endearing and complex, wise and unaware.<br /><br />We enter the play with Henry in his cell, and begins to relive some important moments in his life. We meet Emerson and his wife, Henry's mother, and favorite brother John, as they inact with his memories and become alive themselves. The ebullience of John is obvious, which makes his passing much more severe. This play helps to maginify the brilliance of a brilliant man, while making him more human, more real.<br /><br />The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail is a great read, and will springboard your interests to study this amazing thinker.	2005-02-21

If you are, even a glimmer of interest, then this is absolutely the book for you. Steve Pond has a true gift; the ability to witness the inner workings of a fabulous show, and the ability to write about it in an entertaining, fast-paced way.<br /><br />Steve Pond was granted unprecedented access to the most recent Oscar shows, and reports many findings in The Big Show. He doesn't shy away from sharing his opinions about certain celebrities, and will name names when warranted. Nothing in his book is outright slanderous, most of it is fair reporting of the things that he observed. One thing that surprised me were the amount of Hollywood stars that were smokers.<br /><br />Pond also painstakingly reports about all of the behind the scene work that goes into the sometimes four-plus hour long production. From the producers endless job of overseeing the masses of people and masses of egos, to the director, who somehow needs to make this marathon visually entertaining, the people behind the scenes get their deserved credit. I shall never watch this show without a now deeper understanding of all of the hours, days, weeks, and months of work it takes to put those hours on my television screen.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book as an engaging, entertaining read. Here's hoping that Steve Pond finds himself at this year's Oscars, and we get another behind the scenes look at this amazing process.	2005-02-15

Today, his thoughts, opinions, and experiences inform and educate us, enlightening us to a world of possibilities. Henry David Thoreau wrote Walden, and now all of us have a chance to spend time there in this richly illustrated edition.<br /><br />Jeffrey Cramer, Thoreau scholar, has meticulously put together this labor of love for the book, as is shown on each and every page. Writing a short, insightful introduction to this book, and carefully research notes in the margins of the book, add layers of understanding to an already powerful book.<br /><br />I hadn't ever visited Walden prior to this book. As a Walden novice, it served as an excellent introduction to an amazing man and an amazing work. I'm sure that both novices and scholars will benefit from this wonderful literary escape from the world. Yet the escape teaches us more about the world than we might ever know.

Judy Garland's red rubied shoes dancing along a technicolor Yellow Brick Road, with her comrades singing in tow. A bewjweled Emerald City filled with singing citizens and horses altering their colors. A witch so purely evil that her presence is felt even when not on the screen. It's indeliable, burnt into our collective American memory. Maguire's version is, to say the least, not MGM's version, but one of his own, unique creation.<br /><br />Meet Elphaba, destined from birth to become what her first word is, a horror. However, Maguire spins the tale of Elphie to have us explore the nature of evil, and how someone might turn \\"evil\\", whatever evil may be. Given a certain set of circumstances, one may find oneself doing and thinking things they might have never done before. Elphie finds herself an outcast of sorts because of her greenish skin, but overcomes her condition as she attends Shiz University in Oz.<br /><br />It's at Shiz where she meets the great Galinda, and due to unfortuante circumstances, must be her \\"roomie\\". The two become an odd pair, and one thinks that their paring makes more and more sense as the story spins forward. Is Maguire suggesting that evil needs goodness to survive, as Galinda, soon Glinda, needs Elphaba?  It's a tempting thought.<br /><br />However, this is the Wicked Witch of the West's story, and not Glinda's. She soon disappears from the story and is mentioned only in passing from time to time. I would have appreciated to have a counterpoint to Elphaba's story in Glinda's story, but then, the title of the book is Wicked, not Goodness, so that decision makes sense.<br /><br />One must shed preconvinced ideas of the Wizard of Oz in order to full appreciate this book. As Maguire states, this isn't ever meant to be a prequel to the Wizard of Oz, but a re-imaginging of the story. Maguire's writing story is fluid and wordy, and takes a moment to sink into. Once you allow yourself to enter Oz, it's a journey worth taking.

Quite often, it is the disenfranchised that bears the brunt of histories rath, no more so than the groups outlined in Margaret S. Creighton's magnificent work, \\"The Colors of Courage\\".<br /><br />So many books out there have painstakingly dissected the grand battle of Gettysburg, some tomes hundreds of pages long about just one day in the town. However, the stories contained here are rare and untold, and finally have seen the light of literature. And a finely crafted book it is.<br /><br />Creighton, obviously relying on the sketchiest of details, has recreated the lives and passions of three groups of people affected in Gettysburg: immigrant soldiers, women, and African Americans. Creighton's style doesn't weigh heavily on the endless parade of names often associated with historical texts, but centers on a few people who represented each group. Their stories are compelling and intrguing. Even in the tale of nin year old Sadie Bushman, where research may not reveal much, Creighton provides an historical overtone to how childhood and especially girlhood, was revered in America in the 1800's. The effect is wonderful, and moves the story along.<br /><br />Horrifying is the treatment of African Americans in the border town of Pennsylvania. Creighton tells the tales of a dual \\"Underground Railroad\\", one that returned slaves to the south as well as the more well-known one that saved them. I'm embarrassed to admit not having even known this was the case; thank goodness Creighton's book corrects the error.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to further develop their understanding of the terrible battle of Gettysburg. These groups now shall not be forgotten, thanks to the work of historian and author Margaret Creighton.	2005-01-24

While it's certainly up to each person to form and express their own opinions about Clinton, I seriously doubt that typing a few lines of malicious words in an Amazon book review is an effective use of anyone's time.<br /><br />Hillary Clinton, oft demonized and misunderstood First Lady, has finally added her voice to the cacophony in her new book, \\"Living History\\".  After reading the book, it is amazing to see how much \\"living in history\\" this woman and her much addled husband have endured over the course of their political lives.<br /><br />The book starts with a recounting of her early years, and ends with her dramatic U. S. Senate victory in New York. Between those two events, this books serves as a partial memoir, partial explanation of events, and partial lambasting of the biased forces so intent to remove the Clintons from Washington DC.<br /><br />These are the two parts of the book that I enjoyed the most, the beginning and the endings, possibly because I had a sense Hillary was really speaking to me in these sections. She comes across as warm, supported, and encouraged  as she retells her childhood and her families stories. As she deals with the Lewinsky scandal towards the ending, she also seems to drop her defenses and explains her anger.<br /><br />The parts in the middle seem the most distant to me, though. As she recounts the entire Whitewater disaster (a scandal that admittedly I'm still confused about), and the early years of Bill Clinton's presidency, there is a distance. She lists the facts and her viewpoints succinctly, but the passion of  the early and later chapters is simply not there. That is one reason I took off a couple stars.<br /><br />What impressed me most about her book is the wealth of incredible experiences she's had, and her utmost devotion to being Chelsea's mother. Also, her drive to improve the rights and options for women worldwide should be applauded warmly. I also appreciated how she shared her struggles about whether or not she should stay married, and how she reconciled that within herself. Frankly, she didn't need to write that; it's her own business.<br /><br />Speaking of which, for those who claim this book is nothing but lies, I'd like more specific clarification what are the lies: that women worldwide are still constantly suffering rights abuses? That Hillary doesn't love her own child? That she was very upset when her husband confessed the truth about Monica? That she won the New York U.S. Senate campaign?

Remember one cold winter's night, a cute little muffin perched atop his father's shoulder,wishing God's blessings upon everyone he met? This Tiny Tim, who helps the reformation of one of literature's best loved misers, has long deserved a tale of his own, and Louis Bayard has granted this request in \\"Mr. Timothy\\".<br /><br />This story's yarn starts at a Tiny Tim of 23, young man, nearly healed leg thanks to the benevolence of his evergiving \\"Uncle N\\". Just burying his father Bob Cratchit, Timothy ventures out in the story to make a name for himself, and his own mark on society. Pulling up digs in of all places a bordello, in which he earns his room by teaching its grand madame the fundementals of reading. Like his uncle, he's haunted by his own ghosts, in the form of his father, whom appears randomly throughout the streets of London through Tim's eyes.<br /><br />Soon, dear Tim meets a waif, the irrepressable \\"Colin the Melodious\\", a nine year old, streetwise urchin who becomes Tim's Dr. Watson, in the case of several girls found dead along his neighborhood streets. For awhile, the branding of a letter \\"G\\" on their forearms is the only clue Tim has, until he meets another waif, Philomena. Beautiful of face inspires Tim to help her, along with a lack of English that hinders him, Philomena is the unwitting center of a mystery that only Tim's pernaciousness will crack.<br /><br />Bayard's writing is both true to the mid-ninteenth century style of Dickens, and enjoyably brisk. Having command over both slower scenes that develop the story, and faster, action packed scenes that become real page turners (one involving a carriage that was simply amazing), Bayard makes this story come alive and a truly enjoyable read. It does take awhile to adjust to the words he uses, and from time to time, his exacting descriptions of 1860's London were a bit much to fuss through. Rest assured, you'll be on your way in the story in no time flat.<br /><br />Do all of our beloved characters of literature grow up? Peter Pan? Tom Sawyer? Tiny Tim? Perhaps, perhaps. This Tiny Tim certainly will not let you down, and you'll enjoy your time spent in London with a cast of characters richly drawn and realized in \\"Mr. Timothy\\".haracters of literature grow up?

Apparently even when he was alive, Washington maintained an appropriate distance and other-worldliness that elevates him from the common man. Several books of late have attempted to pierce that historical veneer, the latest being \\"An Imperfect God\\" written by Henry Wiencek.<br /><br />Wiencek examines the life of Washington through a new lens, that of slave owner. Whereas we tend to deify this man, Wiencek first sees him through the eyes of a aristrocratic Virginia land owner, which meant he did own slaves. The path from this position, very much the social norm of the time, to one who \\"frees\\" his slaves upon his death, is mapped out very ingeniously and compellingly throughout his text.<br /><br />Washington starts out owning slaves, and apparently, sees nothing wrong with it. However, as Wiencek leads us on the journey of Washington's life, we see a gentle and subtle transformation in this behemoth. A particularly informative chapter on Williamsburg sheds much light on the subject; it is both compelling reading and absolutely heartbreaking. Washington sitting in the Constututional Convention, silent on the matter of slavery, makes you angry, because you know by then, he was on his way to seeing the horrors of owning people. By the end of his life, you see the end of this journey, and his quiet passing is saddened with the ending of the book and his life.<br /><br />Some people have complained that Wiencek's style of writing \\"interferes\\" with the enjoyment of the book. The construction his chapters allows for some biography, and then he furthers examines the content by sharing some real life experiences. For example, when talking about slavery at Mount Vernon, he goes to the site and does some work that the slaves would have been required to do. In Williamsburg, he talks with some African-American reenactors to get their points of view. I found this to be wonderfully invigorating and not at all confusing.

Augusten Burroughs, known mostly for his inspiring, hilariously ridiculous non-fiction proses \\"Running with Scissors\\", \\"Dry\\", and \\"Magical Thinking\\", penned this silly, fast paced novel about the life of a home shopping network. The end result is a shallow but ultimately funny novel that makes a great airplane read.<br /><br />Several of the hosts of \\"Sellevision\\", the premiere home shopping network, maintain personable and wonderful lives in front of the camera, only to have them fall apart behind it. Start with Max, a gay host who has an unfortunate \\"outing\\" on a children's segment, which lead to his dismissal sets the tone for this unusual romp. Max must try to find another job in an overstocked market. Peggy Jean, who relies a little too much on bottles instead of prayer for relief, suffers from the taunting of a stalker named Zoe, who is not who you think she is. Leigh's affair with the network manager is leading her down the path to nowhere, while popular host Bebe meets the man of her dreams over the Internet, or does she?<br /><br />Wildly funny in places (Barbara Striesand for vice-president?), this book is a precursor to the Burroughs wit shown more fruitfully in his non-fiction. Not challenging to read, this a great read for a long drive, or an afternoon on the beach, or an airplane flight. The end result for every character is somewhow appropriate and a little bit dark. But then, what do you expect from the ingenious mind of Burroughs?	2004-11-14

Her experiments in three different communities in three different areas of the country are unique and heartbreakingly honest.<br />Setting up some ground rules early in the book, Ehrenreich tries to follow them as closely as possible. In each of her situations, she honestly tries to make a living by working jobs that are mostly available to America's poor; waitressing in Florida, a maid in Maine, and a &quot;Wal-Martian&quot; in Minnesota.  Each story she spins about each city is compelling and honest. Ehrenreich quickly discovers how brutal our country can be towards the poor, and one begins to understand their feelings of disenfranchisement very quickly.<br />Once more, she punctuates each of her tales by telling the stories of others she has met. While others may discount her experiences as inauthentic, one cannot dismiss the experiences of those working poor she encounters; people who despite having two jobs still must live in their cars, or with many others in small apartments.<br />Ehrenreich has written a very threatening book, for it tampers with the way that many of us choose to see America. Ehrenreich's ultimate challenge to us is to open our eyes to all segments of our society, so that we may begin to realize that comments like &quot;why don't they just get a job&quot; doesn't roll off our tongues as easily as it does. So that the next time we feel the need to treat waitresses, housecleaners, or store employees as servant, we may think twice. So that we may truly become a &quot;more perfect Union&quot;, as was our forefathers challenge to us today. Thanks Barbara, for opening our eyes with this important, important book.	2004-06-04

Needing a book to read at the end of the year to my kids, I e-mailed a trustworthy librarian friend of mine, and this book was on the top of her list. That afternoon, the book was in my hand, and the next day, it was finished. Leon and the Spitting Image was an imaginative, drop-dead funny book that I can't wait to read to my class.<br />Written by Allen Kurzweil, who's better known for writing adult fiction like the wonderful \\"A Grand Complication\\", this book is all about Leon, a rather inept, un-dexterous lad who gets the misforunate of being assigned to Mrs. Hagmeyer's class. The Hag, as she is affectionately known, loves sewing above all else, much to the chagrin of Leon. As if in a labor camp, her students are forced to sew \\"animiles\\", little animals stuffed with her old panty hose. Leon's cohorts, P.W. and Lily-Matisse, engage in the mystery throughout the book, who is this horrible teacher Hagmeyer, and what can she possibly be doing with the creations?<br />The book is funny on two levels: children will love it for it's low-base humor (although I must admit to chuckling from time to time as well!), and smarter kids and adult will love it for it's sly, occasional puns, and situational humor (like a group of mimes, staying at the hotel that's Leon's home, complaining that their microphone isn't working). Writing a children's book is challenging because you must cover both arenas for a truly entertaining book, but Kurzweil holds up well. It is hardly reminiscent of Harry Potter, but much more in the vein of Roald Dahl.<br />By the end of the story, you don't necessarily want it to be over. Hopefully Kurzweil has in himself a few more books, so we can spend more time with Leon, his pals, a maid, an ice machine, and Napoleon!	2004-05-30

Vaguely familiar with the case, but not having read the book, I was still immediately saddened by his death. An hour later, book in hand,  I sat to read a compelling book about the unfounded theories of a doctor that led to the tragic life of Reimer, \\"As Nature Made Him\\".<br />The book, penned by Rolling Stone scribe John Colapinto, recounts the horrific, and I mean horrific, childhood of Bruce Reimer, having survived a botched circumcision, only to be forced to live as a girl by two well-intentioned yet ill-informed parents. Now Brenda, his life bascially becomes a living hell, dressing and acting against his very nature. Even worse, he is forced to undergo bizarre and irrational questioning by supervising doctor John Money that literally made my stomach turn.<br />Colapinto's book moves fast, very fast, through David's life, making for a quick read. Yet the speed in which you can read this book in no way detracts from its central messages. David comes out of the whole ordeal a wounded survivor, possibly an inspiration to others who might befall the same fate. And yet, his demons caught up with him, causing his recent suicide.<br />Perhaps none of this would have happened if that one failed circumcision never occured. Or if his mother happened to miss a television special with the notorious Dr. Money on it. But it did, and the tragedy of it all loomed over this work. We simply cannot afford, as a society, to play with people's lives for the sake of advancing careers or prestige or fame. People are much too important for that. Let David's life and death be an example, so that this simply will never, ever happen again.	2004-05-23

Thus is covers many topics, some very thoroughly, in a concise, Time magazine sort of way. From Prophet Joseph Smith's visions and his establishment of the Mormon church based on his translated texts, to the current church (current as of 1999), you learn about many church aspects.<br />One of the most intriguing chapters early on is the polygamy chapter, which was handled fairly without judgment. Another chapter explains the complex organizational structure of the church, which comes across as being very totalitarian and a top-down form of leadership. A third chapter explains the development of the Mormon family, and the roles people play in them. The last few chapters discuss the religious beliefs of the church members.<br />All in all, I found while the text is very informative, it also reads very dryly. Perhaps because the authors attempt to present a vision of Mormonism without their own personal beliefs in the way, it reads very matter of fact and not very compelling. I've read other books that account the death of Joseph Smith which have moved me much more than the mere reporting of it in this book. While I appreciate authors leaving it up to the reader to make any decisions based on the material presented, a bit of humanity and a bit of themselves would have made for a slightly more enjoyable read.<br />If you know nothing of the LDS church, and are interested to learn what it's all about, this is the  book for you. If you already have a working knowledge of the church, and want more, there are a host of other books out there that might fulfill your needs better.	2004-05-16

When asked what book provided you with the basis of your faith and beliefs, I imagine many people would say it's the Bible. When asked how the Bible you are reading came to be, I'd imagine that most people wouldn't have the faintest idea, but merely launch into a talk about &quot;faith&quot;. Pagels attempts to trace the history of the formation of the Bible in her well researched and meticulously notated book &quot;Beyond Beliefs&quot;, and does a fantastic job.<br />Author of the book &quot;Gnostic Gospels&quot;, Pagels revists the Secret Gospel of Thomas as a method to describe the historical background into the formation of the Bible as we see today. She starts her tome with a largely personal story about her ailing son and how church called her to help her through this crisis time. She launches into an intriguing comparison of the Gospels of John and Thomas, and how the four gospels came to be &quot;the chosen ones&quot;, all because of a Lyons bishop named Irenaeus.<br />The main character of her story is this Irenaeus, who comes across as well intentioned, if not tolerant, of other gosepls floating around during the fourth century. Due to splintering all over of &quot;Christians&quot; based on their own personal beliefs and interpretations of Jesus' life, Irenaus sets out to streamline the Christian faith and have a general set upon bundle of agreements to work from. This job is none-to-easy as different sects have different thoughts.<br />At first, Irenaeus could be the type of historical figure somewhat villified by denouncing other gospels as heretical and removing them from public consideration. However, Pagels strives to show us all sides of the bishop, and emphasizes that despite his preference towards Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, he was sympathic and tolerant of a variety of religious expressions. He just felt it important to have a basis from which all Christian thought arises, thus leading to the Nicene Creed, among others.<br />Pagels work is engrossing and mesmerizing. Anyone with a taste for history and religion will eat up this book for breakfast. Her writing is thorough and understandable. Sometimes, professors, as they write from their ivory towers, forget their audiences, Pagels strives for understandability and clarity. She is approachable and engrossing in her writing.<br />I fear some people, whose faith is rigid and based not on questioning it, will find this book unbelievable. They might think how dare anyone question the early Christian church and the eventual work known as the Bible. However, this book only adds to the deeper dimensions of our faith. By learning more about where the Bible as we know it comes from, we gain an appreication for the work as a sense of what it is; a purposefully planned document designed to shape faith. The fact that there are other gospels out there, whether or not they are true. is not a threat to my beliefs, but only adds and enhances what I believe. Let me be the judge, after reading them, what I believe. Pagels suggests that people for themselves are empowered to find the light within. For some, that's heresy, for others, salvation.<br />I highly recommend &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; as an important text to support your faith, and to make it fly.rossing and mesmerizing.

The end result, as most of us know, was the formation of the controversial but important recognition of same-sex relationships called \\"civil unions\\". What most of us don't know is the inner workings of the Vermont government as it came to deal with this issue, and the ultimate political sacrifice that many people played in order to ensure equal rights for all of its citizens. David Moats, editor of the Rutland Herald, describes in detail, how that all transpired in his book \\"Civil Wars: A Battle for Gay Marriage\\".<br />Moats approaches the story from a journalistic standpoint as he describes couples who were fighting to get legal recognition of their long term relationships. With the court siding on their side, but giving the problem back to the state legislature, the storm of politics brews quickly and deeply. With the leadership of then governor Howard Dean, we see how the machinations of state government worked to churn out the only viable option at the time, civil unions.<br />While being very a straightforward book, Moats treats the subject matter fairly and with respect. His handling of the gay relationships, and the people stories, is respectful and honorable. He clearly has opinions on gay marriage, and yet, those opinions doesn't shade his view of the events in Vermont. If you don't agree with legal recognition of gay relationships, at least you can appreciate, by reading this book, the intense scrunity and thoughtfulness those Vermont legislators put into forming this landmark bill.<br />Perhaps one day, our own Congress will wrestle with the fact that its denying a group of citizens fair and legal recognition of their relationships based solely on whom they love. If that's the case, Moats' book gives us a sense of hope that fair minded people will come to the correct conclusion; that in our country, built upon espoused principals of fairness and equality, people must be afforded the same legal rights and protections offered to all of its citizens.  There simply can be no other choice.eople must be afforded the same legal rights and protections offered to all of its citizens.  There simply can be no other choice.	2004-05-02

Okay, it seemingly appears on the cover as being sacreligious. After all, Jesus having a childhood friend named Biff, of all things? However, despite it's cheeky tone and some brilliantly funny scenes, there is a sense of reverence that flows under the story, which in turn, ends up dominating the ending.<br />Biff is narrator, called from the dead to tell his story of his best pal Jesus. Friends since the early days, there is a comraderie between the two lads, a la Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. Biff, frankly, is nothing short of an idiot, but a well-intentioned idiot. He is seemingly unimpressed by the miracles his friend can do, and often calls on him to perform to suit their purposes. And in great Hope and Crosby form, due to a problem with a certain Roman centurion, they have to take to the road, following Jesus' wish to meet the three wise men that visited him at birth.<br />This is the richest part of the novel as the author spins a fantastic tale of  what might have happened to Jesus during those unaccounted for years. Given free range, Moore runs with it and paints a wild adventure that's amusing and entertaining. Several times I was enchanted with the action and the humor. Biff is living it up, and Jesus, seemingly understanding his friend and his role, allows for both to happen.<br />And in fact, that is one wonderful thing that Moore does in the book. Jesus is never made to be anything than what history has deemed him to be. In other words, the character of Jesus in his book fits with our perception of who he should be. When it comes time for Jesus to decide whether he wants to be sexual with a woman, he elects not to, bit in true young man fashion, pumps Biff for all the juicy details to understand the act. We see a Jesus confused by his own destiny, yet figuring it out, somehow with the help of Biff.<br />What starts out as a promising two-thirds of a book ends up disappointing in the end. Of course, I began to wonder what was going to happen to these characters one the fictional Jesus collides with the historical Jesus and needs to start following the Gospel narratives. Moore plunges along, and with it, much of the humor fades. Perhaps it would have been wiser to stop the narrative at that point. We all know how it's going to end and frankly, there is no easy to way to make light of it (unless you're in Monty Python.... but I digress).<br />So I give this book three stars, for an admirable two thirds of a story that is funny and wise at the same time.ters one the fictional Jesus collides with the historical Jesus and needs to start following the Gospel narratives.

Somehow, David France's book &quot;Our Fathers&quot; manages to encapsulate the events into a very approachable, readable tome that documents thoroughly the eventual unmasking of the American Catholic church in its response to child abuse.<br />The scope of abuse in the Catholic church, and the equally vile attempts to cover it up, rivals the atrocities of Watergate. Certain priests, who violated boys, some even in there own homes, were merely reassigned to another parish to start victimizing a new batch of boys. Some were sent to a wayward house, and after spending a few months there, deemed themselves &quot;cured&quot; and then were foisted out on more unsuspecting parishoners. France details these accounts accurately  and honestly, including the total destruction these boys and in some cases girls faced in their lives, without going into too graphic descriptions.<br />Painstakingly researched, France has made this huge topic extremely accessible. One great problem with reading non-ficiton books is that there are usually a host of characters, all with important roles, and it's very easy to confuse one with another. France goes out of his way in this book to delinate between the different priests, and often will remind you of  a certain trait or habit of a priest to trigger your memory. I never once was confused as to who was who, thanks to France's effort.<br />This is a must read book for anyone; part mystery, part historical record, you are rooting for the vicitms to have their day, and when the last page is turned, you are somewhat releaved as to the results, but still enraged that anything like this happened; and hopefully enraged enough to ensure it will never happen again.	2004-04-12

I think many of us would like to think that if a family that we know well is in dire need, we would go to extreme measures to help them in any way we can. But if it came down to a life-and-death decision, I wonder how many people would have made the same decision that brave Miep Gies made to help out the Franks. She details this decision, and her years of helping the Franks hide in the little apartment behind her office, in her well-told book \\"Anne Frank Remembered\\".<br />Part memior, part rememberance of Anne herself, this book details the life of Miep, from a little girl born in Vienna, to her migration to Amsterdam. She becomes an office worker in Otto Frank's pectin business, and her history is now set. Soon, due to Hitler's oppresive policies against the Jews, the Franks must go into hiding to survive.<br />Miep recounts details of her assistance in helping keep the Franks, the Van Daans and Albert Dussel alive. In fact, this book is a brilliant piece of writing to accompany Anne Frank's diary. While Anne details life inside the Annex, we find out from Miep what she was doing outside. Together, they paint a complete picture of the horror and danger of their daily lives. And when Anne's diary stops before that faithful day, Miep's story continues. She bravely tries to bribe the Franks out of captivity to no avail.<br />Whereas Anne is probably the most \\"famous\\" Frank, Miep does talk about her from time to time, knowing that we would want to know her impressions of the little girl. She offers some touching, poignant insights to Anne, making her seem more real, if that's possible. Detailing Anne growing out of her clothes, which Anne domcuments herself in her diary, is a particular moment that shows us Anne having to grow up, imprisioned becuase of her religion and for her safety.<br />Without a doubt, Miep and all of the people who aided the Franks in the Annex are heroes. This time of history had many thousands of heroes, many of them unsung. Fortuantely, we have a well-documented life of Anne and we can spend as much time as possible with them, thanks to these books.ve a well-documented life of Anne and we can spend as much time as possible with them, thanks to these books.	2004-04-11

All of this adds up to a most delightful, enchanting read in Allen Kurzwell's &quot;A Grand Complication&quot;.<br />Literally, I learned of this book yesterday in an e-mail I received from another source. Piquing my interest, I purchased a copy on a whim, and sat down to devour this deliciously juicy story. Part mystery, part literary banter, part biography, this book brings us reference librarian Alexander Short, who is short on his marriage, his job, and his obsessive note taking. Approached in the first chapter by Henry James Jesson III, who asks for his help in solving a personal mystery, Short becomes a Burt Ward to the older man's Bruce Wayne as they puzzle out the reason for an empty cupboard in a cabinet of wonders.<br />This story is brisk, engaging, and entertaining. Literally filled with literary puns and some literary references that I didn't understand, the story moves along in a very bright way. I was fascinated by Alexander Short. He's both brilliant and somewhat manic, and somehow really, truly understood him. Mid in the book, he gets a phrase stuck in his head that is stuck in mine as well, &quot;Santo Domingo, Caracas, Miami, Divorce&quot;. Rich.<br />Rarely do I find a book that captures me so and refuses to be put down, but &quot;A Grand Complication&quot; does just that.

She fails to ever talk down to her audience, but rather, challenge us to aspire to higher levels of meaning by writing challenging literature of the highest quality. Thus, &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; falls into that category.<br />As her first novel, Morrison herself suggests that at the time of her writing this, she was not advanced enough to handle the language, and therefore, finds it somewhat clumsy. The book I read was incredibly rich and deep, inspirational and chilling.<br />We find one narrator of the story, a little girl named Claudia, retelling the events of a another black girl in her small Ohio town, and the horrible things that Pecola had to endure. Described by nearly every character in the novel as &quot;ugly&quot;, Pecola's only wish is to have blue eyes, so that she can attain the societal expectation of &quot;attractiveness&quot;. Pecola comes from a warped, unsupportive family, which thereby shapes Pecola's viewpoint and outlook on her own life.<br />One thing Morrison does so efeectively in her novels is switch narrators whenever she sees fit. At times, Claudia tells us the story; at others, a third person narrator allows us to soar above the story and get more important information that a little girl may not be privvy too. At at times, we even learn about the events of the story through women who merely gossip the story. The effect allows us, the reader, to garner more informaton, some of it in personal ways, to allow us a grander sense of this story.<br />Morrison's literature, in every sense of the word, challenges the reader at every turn. This is not a book to read lightly, or just dabble in. Because of her writing, and her writing style, she is able to make grand stories out of the most ordinary people; to give voice to those characters in literature most often overlooked or marginalized in our culture. Morrison must keep writing to allow those voices to ring clear, and add to the cacophany of voices that make America as strong as it is.ces to ring clear, and add to the cacophany of voices that make America as strong as it is.	2004-03-01

The face of Frederick Douglas grabbed my attention; a man that I've respected for many years, encountering him mainly through my study of Abraham Lincoln. On the spur of the moment, I snatched up a copy of &quot;My Bondage and My Freedom&quot;, and within a few days, my admiration in Frederick Douglass was transformed from interest to awe.<br />Frederick Douglass orginially penned his book as a response to people's accusations that someone as articulate and composed as he couldn't possibly be a former slave. With that goal in mind, Douglass wrote his memoirs, in a straight forward, powerful way. In the book, he painfully and honestly documents the path his early life took; the memories of being owned, how slaves coped during these times, and how he managed to pull himself out of it all.<br />While Douglass' life in itself is amazing, (as he describes the amazing process he undertook to learn how to read), what amazed me even more are Douglass' discourses that he sprinkles through the book, discussing relevant issues during the time. In one instance, he addresses the concern about why slaves simply didn't run away from their oppressive situations. It's almost as if you can actually hear the people talking to Douglass and he responding to them.<br />This book does not only tell the tale of a truly amazing American, but gives us a unique insight to the times. This book should be required reading in every high school in this country.	2004-02-20

Ray Bradbury's futuristic thriller, &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; reads as both analogy and warning, and a dire one at that.<br />This book has been on my &quot;let's read it in the near future&quot; list for some time. But it wasn't until the city of Portland, Oregon selected this book for their &quot;Everyone Reads&quot; campaign that I found the incentive to read it.<br />This story spins a tale in the near future where reading is considered outlaw, that books are contraband, and any attempt of thinking outside the box is handled by extinguishing the threat. Guy Montag is a fireman, but not in the common sense; he starts fires instead of putting them out. He's  &quot;married&quot; to Mildred, in a passionless marriage of convenience; Mildred who prefers to spend time in front of the television and listening to the radio in her life of hopelessness. Early on, he meets the fair Clarisse who boldly suggests to him that life is much more than starting fires. It is the tipping point of his decline, as his life begins to rush closer and closer to the incinerator itself.<br />What impressed me about this book is that it was written in the early 1950's, and yet it reads as well as a modern novel. Bradbury would refute any attempts of suggesting he was forecasting the future, but so much of what he saw the future becoming has transpired. How many hours do our children spend in front of the television? And in these times, when our libraries are being threatened to track patron's records or monitor internet use, how far away are we from Bradbury's 451?<br />It's both chilling and reflecting. As a dour warning for what might happen, we can take heed to this warning to ensure that we celebrate divergent thought and reading as a gift for our citizens and not something to fear. Whereas people would refute the claim that we would never burn books in America, why is it that this book so often has actually been banned from some libraries and schools across this country?<br />We need to listen, and learn, lest we suffer the fate of Montag and start to live in a country and world so brilliantly premonitioned in \\"Fahrenheit 451\\".has actually been banned from some libraries and schools across this country?<br />We need to listen, and learn, lest we suffer the fate of Montag and start to live in a country and world so brilliantly premonitioned in \\"Fahrenheit 451\\".	2004-02-20

This question is addressed in the highly enjoyable and highly readable book, Lincoln and Whitman: Parallel Lives in Civil War Washington\\". In this tome, the reader discovers a deeper understanding of both Lincoln and Whitman, amazingly, through the eyes of each other.<br />It seems natural to have both of these men appear in a book with each other, as the two are linked somewhat through the times in which they lived and the recognition of their stunning intellect. And the book reads very naturally, moving from one story to another without any interruption. The Lincoln and Whitman presented in the book are demystified, and very much human. Perhaps the closeness of their supposed contact allows us a literary entrance into their lives. As Whitman sympathizes with Lincoln, so do we. As Lincoln wonders about the wild man and shows him respect, so do we, building on connections with each other that are timeless.<br />One thing that struck me was Whitman's volunteer efforts in hospitals in the DC area. Knowing that he did that, I never knew just how deeply it effected him and the lives of the soldiers that he visited. Well documented, even with quotes from Whitman's own letters, he expresses his care and concern for the men, many of whom suffered very painful deaths, but were someone appeased by the poet who talked with them and held their hand. It might be tempting to draw conclusions based on Whitman's sexuality, but Epstein respects the poet, and his readers, enough not to do that.<br />Refreshingly, the author doesn't shy away at all from Whitman's romantic life, detailing the men that inhabited his life. We are with Whitman the night he meets Peter Doyle on that street car, starting a seven year relationship despite a huge age gap. I was even more surprised to learn that Doyle himself was in Ford's Theater, sitting directly across from Lincoln, the night he was assassinated. Doyle's story lends credence to Whitman's undertaking as a Lincoln expert later in his life.<br />Almost a third character in the story is Washington DC itself. Painfully recreating the town, Epstein brings the 1860's capital alive unlike other writers have in the past. The muddy streets, the horrible smells, the buildings all come alive with fresh, succinct descriptions that are wonderfully detailed. Being a visitor to the city many times, I began to \\"see\\" it in a different, exciting way.<br />As we wander through both of these extraordinary Americans lives, we come to love both men for their individuality and their connections. And as the book concludes in an amazing, heartbreaking way, we find ourselves sorry that the tale ends, craving more knowledge of them both, separate and together, bringing history alive in a way that hasn't for some time. I'm eagerly awaiting Daniel Mark Epstein's next book, while reading and re-reading this one for times to come., sitting directly across from Lincoln, the night he was assassinated.

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	5	29	34	N	N	The Real Price	Much hype has already been spun about \\"The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill\\". Let's cut through the media hype and the current Administration's attempts to spin attention away from this book. Simply put, this book is THE must read book of winter.<br />Paul O'Neill, former Treasure secretary, served in the Nixon and Ford Adminstations, and had experience with the Reagan and Bush 1 presidencies as well, tells his tale honestly, straigthforwardly, and with much documentation. He tells of an Adminstration that is run entirely on conservative ideology and not sound governmental ideas; of how VP Cheney has more power and control than any of us realize. This is the book that many of us have been wanting to read, and coming from a true insider, makes it more powerful than ever.<br />One of my fears in reading this book would be that events would be sensationalized or over-dramaticized. But that doesn't happen in this book. The President comes across as an amicable, relaxed, and somewhat passive man in his own Presidency. I'm not a Bush lover by any means, but I felt like I got to know a different side to him, a more human side, than that's ever presented publicly.<br />The Price of Loyalty is a book that everyone in this country should read, and learn about the true process of governing currently happening in our government.	2004-01-16

Perhaps because so many younger people are coming out these days, this literature helps to give them a sense of identity. Or perhaps us old folks enjoy reminiscing about the days when we first came out, and the world was fresh, new and exciting. At any rate, Grimsley lends his voice to this genre with \\"Dream Boy\\".<br />This is my second journey into the literary world of Jim Grimsley. First, after having devoured \\"Comfort and Joy\\", I was eager to see what other journeys Grimsley has planned for us. \\"Dream Boy\\" is one incredible journey, but where its destination is still remains to be seen.<br />Nathan is a reticent, introverted sophomore suffering from constantly moving from one area to another. His father is a distant alcoholic with a terrible secret; his mother is as undefined as the wallpaper in their new house. At the beginning of the story, they move next door to a religious family with a son named Roy, two years Nathan's senior. Nathan becomes immediately smitten with the older boy, but is unsure of his intentions. Soon, they are made clear, and a complicated romance blooms between the two.<br />Their courtship dance is the most compelling part of the book, as we see them weave their interest in each other very carefully. Both boys are complete characters, complex and developed. You yearn for them express their feelings and emotions for each other, for them to work out.  But Nathan harbors a terrible secret, one that is slowly revealed, but ultimately threatens everything that Nathan wants.<br />Grimsley's writing style in this book is far more poetic than in \\"Comfort and Joy\\". His descriptions are wonderful, lyrical, and allows you to slow down in this read just to enjoy the words. What could have been a common, everyday coming out story transcends higher because of the melody of his sentences. The music of his writing is simply beautiful.<br />However, the main fault of the book lies in the ending. Taking a beautiful story, Grimsley warps the story by it's haunting, tense climax. It seemed out of book's style to have what happened happened. Frankly I was a bit confused as to the outcome as well, having difficulty understanding what was real and wasn't.<br />Perhaps this is one of those books that will linger in my mind for months to come, thereby, getting a bigger understanding of the entire story.

Several prominent people have lined up to say that under therapy, with a distinct desire to change, homosexuals can honestly wake up one day to find out they are straight. Wayne Besen disagrees with that thought. Besen loads up his ammunition and fires at pointblank range at the ex-gay movement with his powerhouse of a book called \\"Anything But Straight\\".<br />Besen, employed by the Human Rights Campaign, spent four years examining this strange turn of events in American politics, the end result being this book. Dividing up the topic into four distinct sections, Besen starts with a frontal assault on nationally t outed ex-gay John Paulk, and his infamous \\"bathroom break\\" at Mr. P's, a local gay dive in Washington, D.C. He uses that incident as a spring board into the ex-gay ministry movement itself, revealing all of its ugly flaws in the process. He then moves into the practice of reparative therapy, and how it developed with the support of psychiatrists in the field. Next, Besen bashes the political movement behind the ex-gay myths, ripping down the religious right as a primary motivator in bringing to light this fallacy. He ends the book talking about the future of this movement, writing both hopeful and frightening predictions.<br />Originally, I purchased this book wanting to get a more well-rounded viewpoint on the ex-gay theories. One way to combat them with your family, friends, and in society, is to be able to honestly understand where the other side is coming from. Besen's book is more of an assault on this movement, which at first turned me off, but then, as his rhetoric died down a bit, made for some interesting reading. At first, Besen would liberally interject his own opinions about what he was writing, sometimes with a cutting remark or a put-down. We as readers are fully aware of the insanity of some of the things he writes, and don `t need an author to point that out for us. Perhaps some self-editing in that area would improve the book a bit.<br />However, the information that Besen presents is incredibly horrible in and of itself. What he presents is an incredibly thorough book, bringing to light all the negative, nasty things this movement has brought to people's lives. The ex-gay movement is essentially a house of cards built on a pile of lies, and exposure of that will help bring ruin to it eventually. In the meantime, a bunch of people, many of them struggling with their own identity, will be run over by this machine and destroyed. Besen's book is an honest, real attempt to give those people hope and some information to save themselves.<br />\\"Anything but Straight\\" is very much a one-sided look at this contentious issue; but when only the other side is presented in the media, in advertisements, commercials, and television, our country needs books such as these to balance out the hateful damage they do.int that out for us.

Growing up in the suburbs, my life was skateboarding and walking down to the U-Totem to pick up the latest Archie comic book. But one great thing about dating is that you constantly and endlessly exposed to the new. My boyfriend, a rodeo fan, picked up this book on a recent trip and devoured it, and handing it to me saying \\"Read this\\". I did, and found a beautiful, intriguing coming out tale.<br />John Ritchie is the main character, a normal teenage boy whose life on the ranch is seemingly idyllic. He has a family that loves him, chores to do, and a vision for his future, well as strong a vision that a teenage boy could have. His father suggests that he attend a rodeo school, which John cannot wait to attend. Going with his best friend Bobby, he meets Kit, a tall, strong cowboy with whom he feels an immediate attachment. Kit and John become friends, and spend their time at rodeo camp discussing how they've always felt different from others.  Upon returning home from camp, John learns his new friend, challenging him to the core, both about his beliefs about homosexuality and his own internal struggling with it.<br />Ferris does something wonderful with this story. She allows John's eventual discovery of who he is to come slowly and naturally. It's both sweet and without much fanfare, but powerful enough to launch John on the rocky and uneven path of acceptance we've all walked. For anyone just coming out, this book shows that path, a small section of it, as a positive step forward.<br />Set in the world of rodeos, this book also serves as a primer for those of us city folk uninitiated with that world. The rodeo scenes were authentic and honest, and why anyone would want to sit on a bull for eight seconds is beyond me, but you appreciate the characters desires to do so.<br />Eight Seconds is a powerful, simple coming out story, with an interesting, unexpected ending, that left me thinking for days, as I'm sure it would you.m sure it would you.	2003-10-29

Some of the stuff I tried reading in the past is a conglomeration of a convoluted plot that usually ends up with the main character sleeping with all of the other characters in the book before the yawner close. However, my boyfriend, who reads far more gay fiction than I, has been steering me around this world and introducing me to gay fiction that's not only rich, but compelling. Thus is the truth about Jim Grimsley's book, \\"Comfort and Joy\\".<br />He writes the story of Ford, dashing doctor who's struggling with his identity despite his intense feelings, and Dan, an introverted, kind man with secrets to hide. Off the bat, the pairing of these two characters grabbed me: that the handsome Ford, who so easily could have fallen into caricature, finds within Dan a world of possibilities, not entirely based on appearances. In fact, what initially grabs Ford is Dan's voice, after hearing him sing in a hospital Christmas concert.<br />In fact, Christmas keeps rattling around this couple as they decide to spend the holiday with each other first, and then to travel to meet Dan's somewhat accepting parents in North Carolina. This scenario is played out well, as we know Dan's initial shyness would be such a huge barrier to truly get to know him, that we finally learn more about him through his interesting family. Grimsley here too doesn't fall into stereotypes, but makes Dan's poorer family diverse enough to question Dan's sexuality but still welcome the couple with open arms.<br />As all of this swirls around, the main focus is the couple hood of Dan and Ford. From it comes a sense of honesty, and permanence. You know, despite the major issues they must deal with, the strong undercurrent of their affection and love will hold them steady.<br />In an age where breakups are a dime a dozen, and we celebrate the disposable relationships, \\"Comfort and Joy\\" adds its beautiful discordant tone to that chord, and makes for a wonderful, engaging read.wonderful, engaging read.	2003-10-29

With a strong interest in children myself, I always like learning about how gay men have overcome the \\"obstacles\\" and charged ahead with creating their own families. \\"The Martian Child\\", David Gerrold's book, is an attempt to add a voice to that genre, but I'm afraid, a somewhat weak one, overall.<br />David Gerrold chronicles his decision to expand his little family by adopting a child. After seeing a picture of a smiling blond boy riding a bike, he eagerly elects to choose that child. But after finding out the host of issues this child brings to life, including the fact that he insists he's a Martian, the author momentarily struggles with his decision, eventually adopting the boy.<br />The story that follows is a somewhat surface level glimpse into this world which Gerrold created for himself. Based on his own experiences, which would lend itself to having the two \\"characters\\" more deeper and complex, I found them to be somewhat shallow. The father, whose only role is to slurp unconditional love on his son, seems to be one dimensional. It's only towards the end of the book where he opens up and we seem more dissension and questioning about his decision. The boy, who's riddled with emotional issues, also comes across as flat, but who should be an intriguing character.<br />Because I didn't hook into the characters, the plot, as it meanders through the establishment of their relationship and the eventual adoption, never brought forth strong emotions or attachments. By the end of the story, I came to appreciate Gerrold's decision to have such a challenging child in his family, but still not truly understanding why. Maybe the entire \\"Martian\\" theme through me.<br />If you are looking for books on gay men adopting kids, I'd recommend Dan Savage's \\"The Kid\\" or Jesse Green's \\"The Velveteen Father\\", both worthy, emotional books that get to the heart of the matter. Otherwise, I'd leave this book on Mars itself.Mars itself.	2003-10-29

Certainly today, the Mormon Church professes itself to be a strong moral compass in this apostate world, guiding its flock through turbulent times to help them attain the glory of the hereafter. What Jon Krakauer exposes in his newest book &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of a Violent Faith&quot;, are the roots which Mormonism has come from, and what a dark history that is.<br />Part mystery, part history, part expose, Under the Banner of Heaven wanders through the background of the LDS church that many of us aren't aware even exists. Even the layman may know some of the basic facts, Joseph Smith's discovery of some ancient gold plates which revealed to him the book of Mormon; the Mormons great trek west to establish Utah as a safe haven for their faith; how Mormons are some of the most openly pious people in America. What Krakauer is goes deeper than that, and exposes the dark underbelly of this faith.<br />Krakauer immediately sets up his story by giving us the details of a grisly death in the 1980's of a mother and her infant at the hands of a religious fanatic brother-in-law. He soon moves to explain this book isn't about the Mormon church perse, but the extreme elements that have branched off the Mormon church since its inception. The distinction is important, for these fundamentalist Mormons take all of Joseph Smith's revelations to heart, and practice many tenets of the early faith that are publicly decried by the mainstream church, mainly polygamy.<br />By blending Mormon history, the Mormon fundamentalist movement, and the murders, Krakauer makes an intensely disturbing and readable book. I simply couldn't put it down. The chapters on the Mountains Meadows Massacre and early Utah history were especially compelling. He treats Joseph Smith with the respect due to a founder of a major world religion.<br />The night of his murder is explained in detail, showing us the unfairness of his demise.<br />However I did find the chapters that dealt with fundamentalist polygamy exceptionally confusing as fathers married their stepdaughters, their sisters, and their own kids, creating a convoluted family tree. It may have helped to have diagrams of such families, or of those specifically related to the murders.<br />Overall, this book may disturb some Mormons by its exposure of some of the darker times and incidents of the Mormon church. Such things coming to light is not a bad thing, for they soon are dealt with and forgotten. But perhaps Krakauer suggest that hiding them is the wrong course.

Carol Shields recent passing, and the accolades by some of my favorite authors about her writing inspired me to select one book of hers to read. Fortunately, I picked the Stone Diaries, and simply could not put it down until the last memorable word.<br />Shields picks the most unlikely person to feature in a fictional book, Daisy Stone, whose life is mundane if not predictable. After an incredible birth and beginning, we travel with her through different years of her life, somewhat seemingly picked randomly. As we read each chapter, and witness the unveiling of her life, we begin to appreciate and realize that Daisy's life isn't extraordinary, but plain and common.<br />What is extraordinary is that Shields chooses to give a character like Daisy this incredible voice. Underrepresented in literature, women like these exist, they exist yesterday and will exist tomorrow. Sure, they have moments of brightness in their lives, in which we see in Daisy, but it never goes over the top.<br />What amazed me about this book was Shields extremely fluid writing style allows you to flow through this story as if it were unfolding before your very eyes. She allows different characters to pick up the story line, and share their viewpoints. Sometimes we hear Daisy, sometimes we hear a third person narrator. Sometimes we aren't even privy to who is speaking. Shields takes amazing leaps in her writing, trusting her reader to make those connections.<br />I'm saddened by the loss of Carol Shields, but gladdened to know that she's left gifts of literature to discover. In the meantime, if you want a broad, amazing story, pick up Stone Diaries.	2003-07-26

Brent Hartinger does, and he captures those feelings honestly and effectively in his new book for teens, \\"Geography Club\\".<br />Russel is your Joe Average teen struggling with being gay in admist all of the usual teenage angst that comes with high school. Russel's convinced he's the only gay teen in the school, until one night, in a chat room, he discovers another. They plan a secret rendezvous, and Russel is genuinely shocked to discover the identity of that person. Thus starts the plot of \\"Geography Club\\".<br />As soon as Russel discovers other gay teens in his high school, they attempt to form a support group. Hoping to dissuade others from joining, they dub it the moniker \\"Geography Club\\".<br />What ensues is an interesting, intriguing story. Clearly written for teenagers, the style of writing is appropriate for the audience, if not particularly deep for adults. The characters do sparkle alive, and there never was a false moment in any character, especially with Brain Bund. Brain plays the schools nerdy loser, who is at the receiving end of all the schools pranks. Hartinger does a great job making him as three-dimensional as the rest, and you feel real sympathy for his pain.<br />What this book does for adults is evoke long lost feelings about what it was like in high school for those of us struggling to keep ourselves a secret. But more importantly, what this book does for kids is offer a ray of light, an outreach to them. This is the perfect book for the gay kid living in a small town in Anywhere U.S.A., who needs someone or something to identify with. Had this book been around when I was in high school, my life may have been much different.<br />Thanks to Hartinger for writing such a daring, honest book, and for creating the Geography Club to begin with!	2003-07-16

Winston Smith, member of the Outer Party, a small, petty cog in the great machination of \\"Big Brother\\", tries to step out from the shadow of his life in George Orwell's now masterpiece, \\"1984\\". Written over 50 years ago, this book was to serve several purposes, one being a warning to the present that a future like this, however fantastic and unbelievable,  could be in the making should we allow for it to happen.<br />Winston leads the dull life of a worker, not encouraged to think, or dream, for feel for himself. His whole life must be driven to support the Party, which promulgates an apparent non-entity Big Brother as the supreme one.  Winston early on shows the spark of individuality that the Party so wants to extinguish; by daring to write a journal on his own, he seals his fate early in the story. Soon he meets Julia, another worker, who charms and dares him even further to enocurage having an affair.  Together they make a lethal pair, and some lethal decisions, which leads to the great climax in the Ministry of Love.<br />What lies in the story is an amazing prophecy of government gone mad. The Party believes in creating present truths by writing and rewriting the past on its whim.  The Party understands in order to control the people, it must control the language, thereby, creating \\"Newspeak\\".  The Party makes people simply vanish, eradicating them from existance. The Party realizes the people who follow are merely plebians in society, and therefore, should be encouraged to not think for themselves.  In fact, the Party is able to directly lie to the people, using \\"doublethink\\", where they say one thing but mean the other.<br />How much of Orwell's nightmare is something that can be true today? Do we have a government out of control, one that manipulates information for its own benefit, to justify war, ensure fear and terror reigns over the country; one that illegally detains people without trial, right to counsel, or even being charged with a crime; one that wants to extensively monitor our personal phone calls, e-mails, the books we check out of the library, the things we buy in stores. The dots are there to connect them; the challenge is, will you dare to do it, like Winston Smith dared?<br />I believe 1984 is ultimately a hopeful book. Orwell wants to challenge humanity, that during times of crisis, we are able to rise up and change things, so the fateful prophecy so nobly and horrifyingly espoused in 1984 , will only stay between the covers of the book.

Can't stand it.  Return it a few days later. Buy it back a few hours later. Fall in love with it. Such is my journey with Chris Ware's graphic book, &quot;Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth&quot;. Let me tell you first why I returned it, and what redeemed it.<br />I came across this book after a brief EW mention of it, rating it very high. Intrigued, I purchased a copy, and attempted to delve into its layers. Instead of intrigue, I found frustration, mainly because I simply didn't know how to look at the book. I didn't know where my eyes were supposed to go, so many of the early pages were difficult to read. Plus, the characters constant and sudden lapses into their daydreams made for early confusion.<br />So, I returned it, happy of my decision. And then, I attended a live version of &quot;This American Life&quot; that prominently featured the work of Ware. His artwork captivated me, enough to rebuy the book and try again. What I found was an entralling, captivating tale, multi-layered, and worth all the work to learn the language of his drawings.<br />It's the story of Jimmy Corrigan, an everyman without much of a life at all, who is contacted by his long lost father for a Thanksgiving reunion.  Jimmy agrees to attend, which leads him on a retrospective journey of his life and his family. The story is both moving and rich, full of layers upon layers. Once you learn Ware's language, and what he tries to communicate, the story begins to shine like a lighthouse beacon through the pages.  I was surprised to find myself crying at certain parts of the book; my brain was telling me this is simply a comic story, but my heart was breaking along with the characters. That alone is impressive.<br />Ware's drawings are incredible. He communicates so much through each drawing, you need to &quot;read&quot; this slowly, and internalize the story. Whereas you tend to want to skip the less important drawings, quite often they will give you the most information. This book is not one to read quickly, but enjoy, like a fine, fine wine.<br />I look forward to more work from Chris Ware. His artist's eye is impressive, but his storytelling is even more so.ve you the most information.

The can't-put-it-down page turner captivated my literary senses, and played with intriguing, fun themes. Naturally, I went to the first book in which the character of  Robert Langdon appeared, and found it to be equally compelling, if somewhat over-the-top in some parts.<br />Robert Langdon is introduced as a symbologist, who's awakened early in the morning by a phone call and subsequently, a very disturbing fax. His adventures thus begin, and literally do not stop until the next day.<br />What lies between those two points provides an enjoyable, challenging story that is compelling, imaginative, and thrilling.<br />Brown's style is rich with philosophical bantering, provided by his characters at prime moments in the action when they are given &quot;breathers&quot; to discuss certain developments. This allows the reader to feel as if he's learning something as the story spins around him. However, Brown's style is also somewhat shallow and lacking a true depth into his characters. He basically sets up the characters very quickly, and away they go.<br />But this lack of depth didn't bother me. I didn't read this book to get inspired by insightful characters. I read this book to get involved with a mind blowing thriller that I couldn't put down, and Brown delivers on every page. However, unlike &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, there were times that the events in this book seemed somewhat incredibly fantastical and unbelievable. Fortunately, it wasn't too often, so I let them go.<br />Angels and Demons provides many pages of good reading fun, with a few incredible devious twists thrown in. You won't want it to end.	2003-05-07

And pure imagination is what you get from this beauitfully done retrospective on one of the most important films of my generation: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, written by Mel Stuart and Josh Young.<br />Filled with pictures and wonderful stories, this book provides an enchanting, enjoyable walk down memory lane. You read starting from the original impetus to make the film, all the way to a fond reunion many years later of the kids and director.<br />Mel Stuart, being the film's director, has numerous and interesting insights to the creation of this classic. Some of the information in the book is also mentioned in a documentary on the Willy Wonka DVD, but no fear. It seems that if you love this movie, you simply cannot get enough of it!<br />This book was purcahsed for me as a gift, and it does make the perfect gift for anyone who loves this movie. Or buy it for yourself, curl up on a cold, rainy night, and relive all of those wonderful memories you have of this incredible movie.	2003-04-27

Klein is both objective and supportive, critical and understanding. He holds nothing back in his examination of the eight years Clinton sat in the White House. From Monica Lewinsky to Hillary to many of Clinton's legislative endeavors, it's all there.<br />Klein manages to paint this picture by a somewhat standoffishness  through the book. There are appropriate times he interjects himself into the tome, but it's never hindering or borthersome. In fact, it reminded me that he really was an insider, and that his viewpoints clearly had the ability to be one-side, but he is much more broad than that.<br />Clearly, those who will relelentlessly bash this book without ever reading it are merely fooling themselves. The Natural is a book that reminds us of the man we elected twice to our countries highest office, who oversaw a time of great prosperity, who suffered from his humanness as we all do, and has lived to tell the tale. The Natural is part of that tale, and a great addition to it.	2003-04-22

That fact, and a thousand others, come in a new and downright funny book, &quot;Backstage with the Original Hollywood Square&quot;, written by Peter Marshall and Adrienne Armstrong.<br />Part memoir, part fond walk down memory lane, &quot;Backstage&quot; provides insights to the creation and hosting of one of America's all time successful games. Peter Marshall recants many stories, some of which he told on the E! True Hollywood Story of the &quot;Squares&quot; and others are brand new.<br />He starts off with a quick summation of his early career, and how he was offered the emcee job of a lifetime. Then he delves in to all the people behind the scenes that were important to the show. The book starts running when he reminisces about all the stars we grew to love over the years: Paul Lynde, Wally Cox, Rose Marie. While each section of the star could have been longer, he sheds some light on each one admirably.<br />Throughout the book, Peter comes across very polite and respectful. It's almost his persona on the Squares. He allowed the stars to shine by taking a somewhat backseat approach to hosting, yet you realize after watching it he was the glue that kept them together. In this book, he is the mere storyteller, and showcases everyone else.<br />What's more fantastic about this book is the CD that accompanies it. From an album entitled &quot;Zingers from the Hollywood Squares&quot; that was released in the 70's, this CD holds some of the Squares funniest one liners. That alone is worth the cost of the book. I had the album as a kid, and listened to it constantly, and to this day, recalled many of the jokes still!<br />This book was a long time coming, and needed. For many people, The Hollywood Squares wasn't a showcase for has beens, but a welcome comedic relief during some of our nation's most turbulant times.

Well, in this case, it's not an exaggeration. Simply put, Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is THE \\"can't put down\\" novel of Spring, 2003.<br />Part rousing fiction thriller, part historical treatise, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" spins the tale of secret societies, religious fervor, all intertwined in the brilliant mind of one Leonardo Da Vinci. Robert Langdon, symbologist, is called to the Louvre in the middle of the night after the death of an important curator. Suddenly, he is plunged into the vortex of a criminal investigation that is both in and out of his control. Once the mystery starts, it simple doesn't stop or even slow down.<br />Dan Brown's writing style is brisk, inventive, and not terribly deep, which is absolutely perfect for this genre. Each chapter is only a few pages long, which moves the story from one locale to another without so much as a blink. Just as you get involved in one thread, it stops at a crucial point, and he picks up the second thread. It's perfectly attuned to keep you in tune with this book.<br />Be prepared to see \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" on the bestseller list for months to come. And read it before everyone else does!	2003-04-10

Well written, documented, and told from multiple perspectives, you are placed right in the middle of the hysteria for duration of the book.Two children are brutally killed, and in response to the public outcry, Iowa state and local officials attempt to round up \\"the sexual deviants\\", which the majority of those being homosexuals.<br />Caught by sting operations and rattted out by friends, tried and convicted under false pretenses, these men were shipped across state to a \\"mental ward\\" to live as \\"prisoners\\". The lives of these men were forever altered by the experience, and many lived to shame themselves into forgetting everything.<br />Because of this secrecy, Neil Miller was forced to rely on whatever information he could muster from some of the men who were still living, and the people associated with the cases. Therefore, information related to the killing of the children, and the subsequent manhunt is extensive. Information relating to what happened to the men inside the mental ward was somewhat lacking. Understandly so, Miller goes on towards the end of the book stating that several men, still living, absolutely refused to talk about what occured. Their shame is something they've carried around with them for their lives; a shame, unjustly given to them.<br />For anyone today who believes our government is incapable of getting out of control, or anyone who wants to read about an event in gay history few people know about, I heartily recommend this book.	2003-03-30

Dan Savage first caught my attention with the book, &quot;The Kid&quot;, a overly pleasant book about the adoption of his son with his boyfriend, and all the adventures that ensued. I appreciated Savage's candor and honesty with his first book, never realizing, until reading his second book, &quot;Skipping&quot;, that is just his wonderful writing style.<br />Savage tackles head on the seven &quot;deadly sins&quot; in an amusing, yet surprisingly insightful, way. His writing is engaging, breezy, and compelling. He doesn't mince any words in his opening chapter, where he declares war on the &quot;virtuecrats&quot; (you gotta love that term), and their societal hypocracy. He presents a well thought out, opinionated essay blasting them, and after reading it, you stand up and cheer.<br />Each chapter examines a sin, and does it extremely well. I appreciated especially the chapter on &quot;lust&quot;, whichm, no doubt, readers will jump to immediately. It is fresh, honest, and at times, wickedly funny.<br />Throughout the book, Savage is devotedly honest, and forthright in his writing. You never tire of his storytelling. With this book, I'm cemented now as a permanent Savage fan!<br /> Bork, Bennett, Dr. Laura, watch out. Savage is hot on your trail. Too bad none of them will have the gumption to pick up this winner of a book! They may actually learn something, instead of doing all the talking.	2003-03-25

By defying long lasting stereotypes and overwraught cliches, Philip Pullman presents us simply with a coming-of-age story set amidst grand battles of good and evil, a mythical blend of science, physics, and theology, and characters that challenge you at every turn of the page.<br />This book picks up the minute where \\"Subtle Knife\\" leaves off: the death of Will's father, Lyra mysteriously vanished, and the war revving up. The story starts from there, and takes off running. The writing is brisk and challenging on every page. Blurring the lines between good and evil, Pullman suggests that you can't classify a person as good or evil, but only their acts. It's a complex thought, and very daring, and very not \\"for everyone\\", which brings me to my next point.<br />I can absolutely see where Christians, or people of any faith, would have serious problems with these books. There is an epic struggle against the one they call \\"The Authority\\", which stages events for Lyra's development in the future. Some people don't take kindly to any literature that dares to challenge God. I respect that fear, but disagree with it. It is in the challenge that illuminates our own beliefs and faith.<br />I believe such a story, taken in one way, could never sway someone who was truly faithful away from their beliefs, and condemning them into a life in hell. Possibly our positions arre very precarious, and one little push could send someone tumbling into the deep pit fires. But I prefer to view my faith as illuminated by certain challenges, and it's in the questioning that you discover the deeper meanings that always were there.<br />Not to say that this book does that. You could read this book with a thousand different interpretations. The ending is quite interesting, and something  that I didn't predict would happen did, and as a reader, it's always nice to be surprised. But religious allegory, it isn't, but simply, a coming-of-age story, and am amazing one at that, of a little girl who finds her purpose in life.<br />I'll be thinking of this book, and the entire series, for my lifetime to come.ge story, and am amazing one at that, of a little girl who finds her purpose in life.<br />I'll be thinking of this book, and the entire series, for my lifetime to come.	2003-03-24

But then, Philip Pullman pulls quite an amazing accomplishment out of his hat, and produces the second book in an astonishing trio called \\"The Subtle Knife\\". It's everything a reader can hope for, but more, much, much more.<br />Continuing the heartfelt saga of Lyra and her amazing quest of truth, Pullman introduces us to Will, a character as equally as wonderful and complex as his first. Will's destiny seems to be leading him to discover the identity of his father, but it's deeper, much deeper than that. When he meets Lyra, they join together in an adventure that intertwines, science, theology, physics, and magic.<br />The final result is a book that transcends the craft, and soars with such intensity and drama, that you simply cannot put this book down. What amazes me is that until recently, I hadn't heard of these books before. Perhaps its too controversial with its unique blending of science and theology, perhaps it doesn't draw the lines as clear as people expect. This is a thinking persons book, and perhaps that's too much for some people.<br />At any rate, Philip Pullman has granted the world an incredible story, incredible characters in an incredible book. I am eagerly off to finish this series, both saddened and excited to do so. You will be too!	2003-03-16

Based on a recommendation from a friend, I dived into \\"The Golden Compass\\" with some trepidations. Not a big fantasy reader (other than the classic Narnia books and of course, Potter), I worried about my interest level and ability to become involved in the book. No worries here, after the first hundred pages, the book completely draws you in and never lets you go until the very last page.<br />Spinning the tale of Lyra, an orphan of sorts, being raised by the bretheren of a school. Lyra is fierce, brave, stubborn, resourceful, and yet,  full of weaknesses, making her a remarkable heroine. You immediately join her side as she fights to learn her identity, her place in her world. Quickly, she is adept at figuring out complex situations, even before the reader, making her brilliant and real.<br />Two favorite parts of the book involve each person's \\"soul\\", imagined as a daemon, or an animal. So much character knowledge revolves around these daemons that I grew to learn of each character's daemon to help illuminate that said character. And the illusive \\"alethiometer\\", a truth telling instrument that Lyra learns to \\"read\\" is a literary work of wonder, and something I'll be thinking about for some time.<br />It is around her the Pullman weaves his incredible story of magic, auroras, Gobblers, religion, and the all important daemon. Pullman's abiliity to intertwine religion, magic, and science is simply masterful. Throwing in adventure, intrigue, and suspenseful elements, the story is both challenging, and compelling. While technically \\"a kid's book\\", every adult interested in this book will find something to hold on to, to cheer for, to dread.<br />I agree with some reviewers who find the first parts of the book a little difficult to hang on to. In fact, I almost gave it up. But trust me, hang on and read for your life. You'll soon get caught up, and everything will make sense!<br />This is a multilayered, masterful start to the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy.

Many of these books are as dry as a bone, as the authors tell the stories, but fail to bring them alive. Erik Larson has no such problem with his brilliant new book, \\"Devil in the White City\\".<br />Starting with the can't-put-down \\"Isaac's Storm\\", Larson masterfully handles his intergration of historical fact with a blend of fiction-like writing that is exceptionally compelling. Somehow Larson manages to get underneath the facts of a story, to tell the real stories behind it. By focusing on a few important characters, and making them come alive, his subject matter sparkles with a brilliant life of its own, and in this case, it's the Chicago World's Fair of 1893.<br />Who knew of this world of wonders near the turn of the twentieth century? It certainly had escaped my notice before. Larson resurrects this forgotten dreampark to exlploration, discovery, and steel exceptionally well.  Telling the story of the park through the lead designer, Daniel Burnham, is telling the story of male pompousity yet genius during the Gilded Age. As Burnham struggles to envision and build this glorious park, you see everything so clearly. During Larson descriptions, you actually see Jackson Park, you see the buildings constructed, you see the problems as they happen. It simply shines as bright as the White City itself.<br />But, as everything is good, Larson brilliantly chooses to mix in a thriller of a sorts, by spinning the tale of another man, H H. Holmes, a notorious man with exceptionally blue eyes as is frequently pointed out. He is ruthless, vile, but everso charming. A long forgotten criminal has now been resurrected, and he is ever bit as chilling and heartless as any  criminal we know today.<br />To intermix the enlightenment, gaity, and forward looking fair with the mind of a murderer makes for an extremely compelling read. Just as one story gets good, Larson leaves you hanging to pick up the second story. This back and forth motion moves the story on a fast, but attention grabbing pace. It is extremely hard to put down this book, and only exhaustion allowed me to do so.<br />This is one of the best books I've read in a long time, and I cannot highly recommend this story enough. If you dare, you will be finding yourself recommending it to your friends, strangers on the street, or anyone within earshot. It's simply that good.s you hanging to pick up the second story.

Millenial Generation? The Boomers? Care to track your own development through the maze of historical events to find out where you've been, and more importantly, where you are going? Where our country is going? Then pick this book up immediately. Simply put, the &quot;Fourth Turning&quot; is THE most important book written in the last twenty years, and a book that should be required reading.<br />Strauss and Howe apparently have devoted their lives to the study of history and the development of generations in societies. The book is loaded, and I mean, loaded with historical references, some of which I wasn't familiar with until now. By looking at these events, and more importantly, looking at the people that went along with those events, Strauss and Howe noticed some recurring patterns in generations over the centuries. Apply this pattern to our country, and to our future, they have correctly predicted that we are headed for a &quot;Fourth Turning&quot;, a time of great criss and peril.<br />Normally, I shun books that people claim to have &quot;visions of the future&quot; involved with them. They are frequently erroneous and based on the whims of the author. However, &quot;The Fourth Turning&quot; is different. By basing their theories of the future on past events, they offer support and credence to their thoughts. The effect is both enlightening and chilling, but it is one that we simply cannot ignore.<br />I found every single page of their book fascinating as a study or recent history and future history. Also, I personally found self-enlightenment in reading about the generation in which I belong, the long lost &quot;Gen X&quot; crowd, or the title they label it, &quot;13th&quot;. It explains a lot about the world in which I was raised, and the world we live in today.<br />One chilling fact: this book was written in 1997, and the authors predicts a calamatous and unimaginable event in the early part of the 2000s that would signify the start of the Fourth Turning. Who can read this book and not think of September 11th?<br />Don't delay. Read this book.

The Lincoln in this book is torn between his desire to do what is right vs. what he perceives his Constitutional duties. Klingaman doesn't shy away from the reality that Lincoln initially didn't favor emancipation over saving the union, but embraces his struggle and his eventual turn around. This allows for a more dynamic, interesting Lincoln to shine through. Lincoln would finally do the right thing, which we come to understand the depth and complexity of his decision.<br />For Lincoln fans, for people with a casual interest, I highly recommend this book for a new view on an incredible man during incredible times.	2003-02-15
US	52223520	R1O6C0EWTN0PAL	0375411151	209374208	Samaritan	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Wonderfully compelling read	This if my first Richard Price book, and after finishing it this morning, I can tell you it won't be my last. Smart, urbane, honest, rich are all adjective thrown around to describe writing, but in this case, those words have weight and truth, as does every single page in Samaritan.<br />&quot;Samaritan&quot; tells the tale of Ray, mysteriously wounded in an attack in his apartment by an assailant he's not willing to identify. Enter old childhood friend Nerese, a soon-to retire detective and old friend of Ray's, who gets roped into but quickly compelled to solve this brutal attack. Price spills out a bevy of complicated, interesting characters that seemingly haave hard lives and could have done the crime. Without Ray's help, it falls on Nerese's shoulders to turn on her detecting skills, which are finely honed if underused. In fact, it is probably Nerese's character that I found most interesting, loving her stamina, goal orientated thinking, and sheer determination.<br />Price's writing strength is in his brevity of words saying so much. His sentences contain punches that more than once caused me to reread them to get the effect again. Price masters the art of saying much by saying it originally and saying little. It is truly inspirational writing.<br />My only complaint about the book is in some of the characters &quot;stories&quot; that they tell. This is a novel about stories, everyone has a story to tell, from Ray's return to the projects where he grew up, to Nerese trying to give her son a real life, to Ruby, Ray's wrought teenage daughter. However some of these stories wander on for pages and pages, and at least one of them seemed unimportant to the plot. They became distracting towards the end of the story as you just wanted to wrap it up. Small complaint, but valid.<br />Don't miss this book. Put it on your &quot;must read&quot; list, meet Price's characters, and remember them for a lifetime.	2003-02-09

It's a book any film aficiando will not want to miss.<br />Starting out as an article for the now apparently defunct English mag &quot;British Primiere&quot;, Dennis Hensley invited several of his friends over to jaw about the infamous shark movie &quot;Jaws&quot;. The eclectic group of people met, ate, and shared cutting, hilarious remarks about this famous flick. The trend was set, as Dennis screened (or verbally scissored) other classic films such as &quot;Sound of Music&quot; and &quot;Flashdance&quot;.<br />He and his friends riffs on the films brought me into laughing fits where I couldn't stop crying. The comments are approrpriately cutting, off-color, and wonderfully bright.  My favorite reviews were of &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; and the &quot;Sound of Music&quot;. I found I enjoyed the chapters more when I knew the film, but all of them still cut to the core.  Don't dare read this book in public because it is virtually impossible to control your laughing with this book, and people may stare. My favorite commentators happen to be Dr. Beaverman (she often refers to herself in the third person), and Tony, but all of the people offer zingers that Paul Lynde would love.<br />But, in a surprising movie, Dennis starts and ends each movie chapter with a continuing story line, bringing his friend's lives directly into the book. So suddenly, you begin to truly care about these people as they struggle through their lives while verbally assaulting the films in front of them. Certainly this book would have been successful without this add-on, but Dennis' friends become very real, human, deep, and ultimately very, very likeable.<br />Kudos to Dennis and his friends for sharing this work. I'll be on the lookout for more of his writing in the future. In the meantime, I'll be recommending &quot;Screening Party&quot; to all of my friends, if I don't give it to them as a gift first!mending &quot;Screening Party&quot; to all of my friends, if I don't give it to them as a gift first!	2003-01-07

Cunningham manages to capture the essence of the little town on the crook of Cape Cod. It is not meant to be a travel guide, even with the visual descriptions of pratically the entire town. Cunningham weaves his prose/poetry into this text, so that as you are reading, there are places where the writing becomes soft and lyrical. I eagerly anticipated those moments; Cunningham at his finest.<br />Perhaps I loved this book because I love Cunningham's work as well as the town he tributes. I now live on the other side of the country, and a Provincetown trip is no longer a weekend jaunt. But I'll treasure &quot;Land's End&quot;, and whenever I need to slip away, this book shall return me there.	2002-12-15

Augusten Burroughs delightfully grim memoir, &quot;Running with Scissors&quot;, chronicles his early life with such candor and honesty, you both admire and pity the lad, all the while laughing and staring.<br />Augusten was certainly dealt some challenges in his early life. That he grew up to survive them is a testament to his strength of character, or just pure determination. It is easy to see how he survives though. He writes himself as a strong character in this memoir, the sane person in a loony bin, if you will. He is patient observer of all the madness around him. While he certainly fits into the mob with his own pecularities (I personally related to his fascination with Donny and Marie's sparkling clothing!), he also writes as if watching this from afar. Perhaps that distance allowed him to write such a funny, surreal book.<br />Burroughs writing style is easy and familiar. Burroughs writes upfront and honestly, in a matter of fact way, almost as if giving a news report on the insanity around him. It is a brisk, entertaining read that you will not want to put down. I honestly cannot wait to see who dares to make a movie out of this wonderful tale.<br />&quot;Running with Scissors&quot;, one of the most entertaining books I've read this year!	2002-12-07

It was sitting on the coffee table of a friend's house I was visiting, I picked it up and I couldn't put it down. Intensely compelling and riveting, this book picks you up in the first chapter and never fails to let you go.<br />Poor Pi, living under the strain of having a oft-teased first name &quot;Piscene&quot;, grows up in Indian at the Pondicherry Zoo, among the animals that will become so important in the second part. The first part of the tale is delightful, from Pi's reflections of life as a zookeeper's son, to his awakening spirituality in three modern religions. Very funny part ensure when his parents try to puzzle out his religious choices, whereas to Pi, it's just simply true. You grow to love Pi and cheer for him.<br />However, the story takes a dramatic and somewhat disappointing turn with the second, and most important, part of the story. Pi's imprisonment in a lifeboat with a bengal tiger turns this fun story into an adventure saga, one which I didn't expect nor want. As we endure his days on the lifeboat, where &quot;life&quot; in its cruelest forms plays out, the reading sometimes becomes tiresome and confusing. Pi's hallucinations only add to the mixture. I didn't really want a survival story. Whereas the first part of his story promises a spiritual component to it, the second part lets down.<br />In the thid section, Martel tries to draw some parallels between the two, but some of them were lost on me, and probably require an additional reading to appreciate them.<br />Ovreall, the Life of Pi is a tremendous work, but uneven. Perhaps another reading at another time will illuminate this work to the greatest of which I hoped. Until then, I will only mildly recommend it to my friends.	2002-11-16

For once, the hype is true, and \\"The Corrections\\" delivers quite a punch with a riverting story driven by equally more riveting characters.<br />Meet Enid and Alfred, in their waning years. Enid's trying her hardest to pretend everything is as normal as she thinks life should be while her longtime husband Alfred descends into terrible dementia. And then, meet their children: Gary, an obsessive, materialistic lout with a co-dependent marriage; Chip, a drug abusing washout writer with a penchant for younger girls; and Denise, a chef extraordinaire awakening to her sexuality. All of the children are deep and complex characters, compelling in their own faults and personal dementias.<br />The blending of these characters is both unique, and representative of all of our families. You may be reading this book and think \\"I know someone who would say or do exactly that.\\" As the characters mix, sometime hilarous, sometime painful results ensue. Especially interesting is learning about wonderkind Gary first through the eyes of his siblings, and then to meet him in his story is to see him in his reality.<br />One amazing thing Franzen does is allows us to enter's Alfred demented point-of-view, and suddenly the stories become disjointed, odd, bizarre. We see life as Alfred sees life. HIs incoherency is amazing in such we sympathize with him as we were unable to before. Ride through these chapters as illogical, knowing the story will fade back into sense soon enough.<br />One problem I had with the book was in Chip's story and its evolution into a wild subplot that brings him to Lithuiania. It was my least favorite sections of the book because it just seemed to come out of nowhere and really not illuminate his character very well. I felt that Franzen needed Chip to get out of the way while he told Denise's and Gary's stories. I would have preferred Chip to stick around and create more havoc, possibly with Gary, instead of shipping him halfway across the country.<br />Jonathan Franzen granted the world a gift in creating the severely disjointed Lambert family. Ignore the hype, stick with the book, and enjoy the word feast.ith Gary, instead of shipping him halfway across the country.<br />Jonathan Franzen granted the world a gift in creating the severely disjointed Lambert family.

Dr. Wayne Dyer has made significant contributions to advancing the course of peaceful, full lives through some wonderful writings. &quot;10 Secrets&quot; may be one of his best works to date.<br />The power of this book lies not in the words, perse, for many of his thoughts in this book are buried in others of his treasures. The power of this book lies in combining these thoughts together towards a powerful result. Each secret is loaded with wise information, and each one is both independent but related on the others. Reading this book is like looking at a masterful weaving, you can admire the handiwork up close, as well as stepping far back and taking in the whole view.<br />Another wonderful thing about this is in it's brevity. This is an easy book to sit down and read in one setting. The power is, however, to not read this book quickly, but deliberately. Dyer has so many important thoughts in each secret that it takes time and effort to ponder the depth of his sentences. I would advise you to read this book at least twice. First, read it all the way through. Upon that initial reading, you'll feel a tremendous, immediate sense of peace. Then, go back for further study, read, memorize, learn.<br />It's impossible for me to state my favorite secret, for all of them really lend themselves to self-empowerment, and allowing me to take control of my life as I never thought possible.  The book's style lends itself to looking like a book you'd just give someone for a gift. Look beyond that, and look for the honesty deep inside.<br />Buy this book for yourself, and for any friend you know needs a little peace in their lives. It's worth the journey!	2002-08-23

Rich, well-drawn, complete characters, a moving, emotional plot, and  narrator that grips you and won't let go. These are my initial reactions to Alice Sebold's newest offering, \\"The Lovely Bones\\".<br />Much has been said about the plot, in fact, too much has been revealed. The narrator of the book, a young girl named Susie, is brutally murdered and tells her family's story from Heaven, a profoundly unique point of view to tell this story. Susie is very much a middle school girl, and her doubts and fears ,and essential innocence serve this story very well. The different events spell out after her death, as you see her family seize the immediacy of her death and then force to deal with its quiet horror for years afterward.<br />I can appreciate some people's dissatisfaction with a certain plot device, but taken within the whole context of the story, it worked well for me. In fact, this isn't a story that solely relies on plot to move forward, but the rich characters that you come to love. This books unfurls before you like a rich quilt, and scene after scene builds a quiet sense of beauty, moreso than the last one, so that by the time the book is finished, you are sorry to let it go.<br />Letting go is a central theme in this book, and thanks to Alice Sebold, it has been explored in a truly unique way. Ignore the naysayers of the book... read this in the quiet of your life, and appreciate well crafted writing at its finest.	2002-07-31

Some poets aggreviate by not allowing access into their lives or meaning with their work; Doty opens the door, doesn't shy away from honesty or complex thought, and allows us to wander through his charming maze of words.<br />As a reader of his work, it's nice to see him returning to old familiar themes, especially those that mention Wally, a heart's love who perished due to AIDS. While we may write and write about those songs that inspire us, perhaps there can be never enough said about some things, and Doty casts a beautiful literary light on those topics with each passing year.<br />Source is an excellent add to your poetry collection.	2002-07-17

The Lucille Ball in Kathleen Brady's book, &quot;Lucille: The Life of Lucille Ball&quot; is a study of contradictions. Partly an homage to a star she clearly adores, partly an expose on Lucy's dark side, this book paints an incomplete and unsatisfying picture of America's premiere television comedianne.<br />The Lucy in this book comes across both as a scrappy fighter early in her career, and a hardened soul at the end of it, which may very well be true, or not. It was difficult to discover the viewpoint of Lucy that the author was trying to take. At times, it was clearly injected with personal opinions and commentaries not warranted in the biography of someone else's life, both glowing and scandalous. And whereas the majority of the book takes up the years of Desilu's powerhold on the television industry, from I Love Lucy to Star Trek, it shortchanges both her early career and later career, almost as insignificant bookends to her highest pinnacle in the 1950's. Certainly, Lucy had a full, complete life, only some of which is shown here.<br />However, there were some parts I did enjoy. Lucy's less-than-impressive movie career which eventually gave birth to her TV persona was interesting, as you root for her to make the transition earlier. Her undying devotion to Desi in the early years, despite mutual fits of jealousy and rage, made for a deepening look at their marriage.  And the occasional parts that show her softer, kinder side were warm to read.<br />Which leads to this thought. Clearly Lucy is loved country wide; were we ready to learn some negative things about the woman we cherished? Certainly not unknown, nor surprising to anyone who's read other things. The issue perhaps comes in balancing all viewpoints to present a clearer one, rather than being all over the board haphazardly.<br />As for Lucie and Desi Arnaz, Jr.'s objections to the book were clear to me as I read through to the end. Kathleen Brady seemed to have a personal vendetta against these two, as she paints them very unfavorably as spoiled Hollywood rich kids. Nary a kind word was said about these two, which leads me to think they offered no assistance in creating this book, so a price was paid for their silence.<br />In the end, I did not feel closer to Lucy than I had before reading this. I may suggest grabbing a bowl of popcorn, putting up your feet, and watching some classic episodes of I Love Lucy, to remember Lucy the way she wanted us to remember her, with a smile and a laugh.she paints them very unfavorably as spoiled Hollywood rich kids.

Two words that sum up this marvelous work of literature by Rebecca Wells: simply divine. I read this book on an airplane simply to pass the time, and found myself engrossed in a charming, quirky, and delightful romp of four of the most richly drawn women I have met in literature in a long time.<br />Wells manages to capture the incorrigible spirit of each of the &quot;Ya-Ya's&quot;  and their dynamics are wonderful. Their complex, supportive group is a real entity, as real as the characters that created it. The most rich character of the bunch is Vivi, whom you both love and fear. She is a tornado in the Louisana swamps, and her antithesis is her much-confused daughter Sidda.  It's Sidda and Vivi's relationship that lies at the heart of this book. Through Vivi's life, Sidda learns and relearns some important lessons in life that allow her to continue forward. By looking back, it helps sets her future.<br />What could have been merely a fun romp turns out to be dripping with personal nuggets of honesty. With each turn of the page, you laugh, you cry, you contemplate. Divine Secrets is surprisingly full of divine secrets, and discovering them is half the fun.<br />Take it from a guy who loved this book: don't delay, put this book on your summer reading list, and then enjoy the movie.	2002-06-06

Sam Staggs book manages to recreate the story behind the film, not only the making of it, but the world which existed during the making of it. Hollywood itself is a major player in &quot;Sunset&quot;, that artificial and arrogant place, dasher of dreams, and fame beholder.<br />In Stagg's first book, &quot;All About All About Eve&quot;, the author seemed to dwell too much on minutia and ponitless facts (his fascination with Zsa Zsa Gabor's hair color still resonates with me), but now he seems to have learned his lesson. Close Up is rich with information, and moves along at a brisk pace, chapters closing, leaving with you the feeling of wanting more. He recounts the making of the film in a somewhat linear fashion, moving along topics as they seemingly come up.<br />You learn about the great Gloria Swanson's involvement with the film, and the role she played in shaping the great Norma herself. Cecil B. DeMille comes across as a great, crusty old man. Nancy Olson, one of the surviving actors, brings her personal stories and charm to the book.<br />Stagg's sense of humor was enjoyable throughout the book. A couple of times, I found myself laughing outloud at some of his comments. While I agree with a reviewer's claim that he does inject himself into the book, it didn't bother me. It's a story of Sunset Blvd. but also a story about how he came to find out all the information; both are interesting.<br />In the end, I had trouble putting down this book. Staggs learned much from his thick opus &quot;All About Eve&quot;, thank goodness for bringing this classic movie back to life.	2002-05-05

Mann's published works and really enjoyed them. So it was with great expectation that I approached his new work \\"Behind the Screen\\". Sadly, I left the book disappointed and somewhat confused.<br />Mann's attempt to write a comprehensive history of gay Hollywood was admirable, but somehow, he's gotten in the way of his own work. One of my problems with the book is the way in which it was written. As you read any biography, there is a risk of proposing too many names for the reader to handle. Right in the first chapter, as he explains early gay stars, we are innundated with so many names that it is virtually impossible to keep track of anyone after awhile. Talking about people is very important to a biography, but when the reader has little to no knowledge or connection with the names, they merely blend together in a confusing mass of lexiographic confusion. I'd hope it would improve, but sadly, found each successive page more frustating than the last, and I failed to get through chapter three.<br />However, I found a somewhat easier way to read the book. I began looking up celebrities I wanted info on, and just reading those sections. He still manages to litter each page with an abundance of names, but because you may know the celebrity, there is something more to hook into.<br />Mann has an ability to write books that are amazing. Just read \\"Wisecracker\\" and \\"The Biograph Girl\\", both which celebrate early morning lore. Maybe he should try to concentrate on writing more about individual celebrities than a sweeping work that leaves us confused and frustrated.	2002-02-25

Donald himself read some of these poems, and I knew within a minute, I had to have this work.<br />As poets so meekly and admirably do, Donald Hall captures the moments of his wife's last days through her battle with leukemia.

Of course, they don't quite fit in either group, and decide to form their own party: initially &quot;the Freedom Party&quot; and then, more appropriately, &quot;The No-Name Party&quot;.  What follows is stunning, inspirational, heartbreaking, and guaranteed to provoke thought.<br />The story is written in a very interesting way. Partially prose, partially &quot;minutes&quot; which read like a play, it moves the story along to give a true sense of these kids, and they become very real as we hear their voices. One side plot involving a manager of the tie department didn't quite work, but the story more than compensates by offering us middle school intrigue with many twists and turns.<br />How many of us at one time or another that we could fit into that group. It's a shared feeling, and Howe brilliantly captures the agony of not fitting in, and the joy of finding a group to fit in with. After all, isn't that we all want?	2001-12-31

In her book, &quot;Losing Matt Shepard&quot;, Beth Loffreda successfully examines the threads of this event, its effect on Wyoming, Laramie, and the people closely involved.<br />Loffreda doesn't merely rehash the events, but extends and relates them in a matter of fact way that brings a deeper understanding to the entire horrific event. We see the event through many different groups eyes, through his friends, special groups, Laramie residents, Wyoming residents, national media, and even hate groups. It's through this multi-faceted examination that we are drawn deeper into this tragedy.<br />And then at this moment, Loffreda brilliantly takes us around the crime scenes with a sheriff so devoted to Matt and solving this crime, he becomes a true hero in this story. The placement of this section is criticial; just when we yearn for this information, she gives it to us, painting us a picture of the last hours Matt spent on this Wyoming plain, and his eventual death. It chilled me reading it, and moved me deeply. You want to run into the pages to save this poor soul who suffered because of who he was.<br />Read this book. Understand the consequences.

Unfortunately, her new book is not.<br />What the movie had that the book did not was the real, human persona of Cho. Most of what she writes comes across as bitter and occasionally mean-spirited. She seems to have written this book as a vendetta against people in her past that have wronged her. Celebrities who use their fame to exact revenge through writing a book never seem to pull it off well. One story of a camping experience with her friends pulls us on her side, until we read about her treatment of those who wronged her, exposing a bitterness I didn't like.<br />Cho has so much talent, and hopefully, after venting in this book, she can now rise above and shine as bright as I know she can. In the mean time, I suggest holding off on buying this book, and looking for the movie instead.	2001-06-02

Allow me to give you a layman's review! Thomas Cahill's book is a smart, collegiate look at the times that surrounded Jesus, and it doesn't disappoint.<br />He examines the different Gospels and their approach to the story of the Jesus, and how each author tailor made the stories to suit a different audience (hence, the sometimes contradictions within the Gospels themselves), which I found delightfully enlightening.<br />His section on Paul was riveting, painting a picture of how a simple man could be so transformed by an event to change his life entirely. He also works to dispel some myths about Paul, particularly his sexist bias in his letters. He also bravely takes on some church doctrines that are apparently &quot;Bible based&quot;, more power to him!<br />I did find the first chapter difficult to get through at times. I felt that Cahill was using terms and historical names that I wasn't too famililar with, and therefore, left the reader in the dark by failing to explain these people/events/terms. The muddy water soon clears, so just steer a course through the words and trust that your comprehension will come back!<br />Overall, Cahill's book summed up and affirmed much about what is known about Jesus and his times, and provides an inspiring look at Biblical events in the contexts of world history, leading to a deeper understanding of the Son that has transformed much of our own world.	2001-04-13

After this henious act, Clarence Darrow rides in, not to wipe the guilt from their souls, but merely defend them from going to the gallows.<br />There are several moving aspects to this play which Logan has brilliantly captured in small scenes. The courtship and love between Leopold and Loeb is explored fully. Some ficiton and non-fiction written about these two shy away from the possible homosexual connection, but not Logan. Their actions are horrendous, their self-centered thinking abhorrant, but the relationship between the two powers this play and is intriguing.  You want the union of these two not to result in murder, but in love.<br />The other passionate part of the play comes with the introduction of Clarence Darrow in the second act. He rides in and becomes a fierce adversary of the death penalty, and brilliant argues against the ultimate punishment. However, his courtroom bravado is tempered by scenes with the boys, when he tries desparately to understand the actions of these two. And due to his efforts, Leopold and Loeb begin to struggle with the consequences of their actions, and become more human (which, upon my understanding of the actual story, never really happened).<br />John Logan has given us a play that reads very well, is very passionate and compelling, and a true classic of theater today.	2001-03-31

Both parents die within the shadow of each other, causing the kids to suddenly find themselves grown up in a Grown Up World. But fear not, a reprieve of &quot;Party of Five&quot; is not at hand. Dave, with his urban slightly psychotic tone, spins us a tale not of pity, but of true depth and feeling uncommon in literature today.<br />Through his writing, we access his inner being, or what he allows us to see, as well as the &quot;characters&quot; that appear in the book. He trims no edges, doesn't pretty up anything, and shows us the messiness of his life as well as his apartment. Writers can sentimentalize the past; Dave serves it up honestly, and rough, for us to devour. His writing style is stream-of conscious; he lets characters speak to us as they never would, breaks into stories with new stories, and then new stories, and then brings us back; making the reading more of a roller coaster than a quiet read.<br />But that's is what makes this book so wonderful, so compelling, that he allows us this journey by sharing it. And bringing into it the true heart of the story, his little brother Toph, equally challenged by the loss of his parents, but continuing along with the events of his childhood and adolescence in as normal way as he could. And as Dave struggles with being his father and mother to his little brother, we see the love pour out on the page, time and time again, as a dramatic salute not only to unconditional love, but the ability to continue on, moving forward.<br />Great promise, great honesty, great writing, all add up to a top recommend for this stunning, saddening  work.g, saddening  work.	2001-01-28

Part auto-biography, part comic book, part social issues, Winick manages to blend it all together in this stunning literary tribute to a &quot;hero&quot; of the AIDS generation.<br />The book recounts the days before, during, and after the tulmultous months spent living in the crazy house &quot;Real World&quot; house in San Franscisco. We learn a little bit about Judd growing up, and how he came to be a &quot;bleeding heart liberal&quot;. But here is the first suprise! Coming to learn that he might be living with a gay man with AIDS, Judd is forced to confront not only his own fears about the disease, but his own prejudices about everything. That I believe is the complete brilliance of his story. He shows us his own growth, not in a preachy, &quot;you-need-to-do-this&quot; way, but in an honest &quot;this-is-what-happened-to-me&quot; way. It is through his honest struggles that we as readers are carried through with him.<br />But lets not forget Pedro in this as the engine that powers the story. We see a deeper Pedro not shown in the show, a sicker Pedro, a frail Pedro that is truly struggling on a daily basis with his health. We see a human Pedro, instead of his role on the show, &quot;gay man with AIDS&quot;. The respect and love Judd has for Pedro comes across beautifully in the book, and we love both of them all the more.<br />Don't worry, you need not have seen the Real World San Francisco shows to be impacted by this book. Judd draws us a portrait of his own Real World, with the hopes and the joys and the pain for all of us to share and see. And we leave his book &quot;Pedro and Me&quot; truly transformed about how we see and act in our own Real Worlds.<br />Thanks, Judd.  And thank you Pedro.	2000-12-29

It seems that  two rival magazine publishers and societal magnates are engaged in a feud that would make the Hatfields and the McCoys cringe. Phillip and Gilbert get themselves involved through the vocal desires of one Elsa Champion, whom I managed to see as Leony Helmsly with a Suzanne Pleshette voice. Toss in level-headed and intelligent Claire, who comes out as a mastermind while being the only one who manages to retain an ethical base throughout the story. What ensues is spying, counterspying, deceit, lying, and a plot that joyful shreds the borders of human decency into digestable bits. And Keenan obviously has great fun in doing so.<br />While this book doesn't quite live up to the promises made in his first laughfest, Keenan still manages to deliver us quite a tale of misgivings through the story. What seems to lack in this book is a Moira character, who appears in his first book making Judas seem like Jesus' best friend. While Elsa is just as nasty, you are never really surprised about her actions. In fact, as this tale spins along, there are just a few surprising in this fairly predictable read.<br />However, one thing I did appreciate about this book is Keenan's leaving the heart of the first story along with this second story, that is, the relationship between Philip and Gilbert. Friends and rivals at the same time, it is their relationship that is both endearing and real, and you know these two will be with each other no matter what.<br />With that, I heartily hope for a third installment, whatever Joe Keenan can construct. Until then, I'll joyfully return to these two books whenever I need an uplifting and easy read.eturn to these two books whenever I need an uplifting and easy read.	2000-12-29

Paul Rudnick's amazing new play &quot;The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told&quot; pokes fun at anything and everything involved with religion.  Covering everything from Buddhism to Judiasm to Catholicism to Mormonism to  Atheism, Rudnick leaves no stone unturned and spares no expense with his  humor.<br />Divided in two acts, the play covers quite a gamut in religious  theology. The first act recounts the &quot;true&quot; Biblicial couple,  Adam and Steve, their fall from grace because of Adam's curiosity, and  eventually meeting another couple, Jane and Mabel. Together, they survive a  hilarious recounting of the Great Flood, and an even more hilarious  recounting of a rather effemiente Pharoah refusing to let his  &quot;people&quot; go because of his infatuation with the Moses/Brad  character. Brilliant.<br />The second act plucks these people out of the Old  Testament, and places them in modern day New York City, at a Christmas  party thrown by Adam and Steve. The transition is seemless, due to  Rudnick's ability to make it funny and believable. Rudnick leaves no  stereotype unturned, from gay Santas to go-go boy elves, to a Public Access  wheelchair bound lesbian rabbi (I'm not kidding) who steals the act. I  rarely laugh outloud when reading a book, but I had tears in my eyes  reading the second act. Excellent comedic writing!<br />Sometimes reading  plays is very difficult because you need to see the action before you to  appreciate attemmpts at humor. Not with this story. With Rudnick's copious  stage directions, the entire play was acted out in my imagination very  easily.<br />Rudnick's introduction frames the play quite nicely, assuring us  everything religious was up for being a target in his play. If you are  easily offended by religious humor, I suggest you stay away from this play.  But if you believe in a God with a rich sense of humor, or believe in  reading a funny, funny play, I cannot recommend this play highly enough!	2000-08-13

As a fan of his work, I eagerly awaited his latest contribution to my literary world, and found  not the least bit disappointment in this story.<br />In the book, he spins the  yarn of Dr. August, or Fitz, a musical spiritualist who communicates to his  audience messages through playing the piano. At first reading, I worried  this device would become overblown, but through some excellent writing and  plot twists, it manages to keep the story focused without totally consuming  it. Dr. August is a great character, gifted without seemingly so, and  yearning for love and companionship that is just beyond his grasp. Throw  into the mix Isaac, an ex-slave who bravely overcomes his upbringing and  learns to lead with his heart, and Alice, a 27 year old  &quot;spinster&quot; just brave enough to buck societal norms, and we have  a triangle that is complex, and so much more.<br />You will notice upon  reading &quot;Dr. August&quot; how quickly paced the story is. Never  dwelling too much on any one moment, it is a brisk and consuming read. Yet  Bram leaves nothing out, and creates a real world before, during, and after  the turn of the century. Absolutely, spotlessly breathtaking.<br />Do not  delay in reading this fine work!	2000-07-19

Well,  neither had I, as a amateur film buff, until I picked up William Mann's  delightful, compelling book, &quot;The Biograph Girl&quot;.<br />In this  entertaining story, he weaves fact and fiction together flawlessly,  creating a wonderful &quot;what if&quot; scenario that is very realistic.  What if Florence Lawrence didn't die after ingesting ant paste, but lived  out an entirely new life under another name, only to resurface as a fiesty  106 year old?<br />The older Flo is dynamic, witty, and easy to love. She is  both honest and coy, a great character to drive the plot but also maintains  her air of mystery throughout the story.<br />All of the supporting  characters in the story are wonderfully drawn, have complete lives of their  own, and are all consumed by this lady and her story. Mann steers away from  stereotyping characters, for example Sister Jean, who is Flo's caregiver,  could have been saintly and pristine. Instead, Mann makes her worldwise,  and harbors a secret past. Richard's ex-porn star boyfriend is part of a  committed relationship. Anita is an aspiring actress who holds her career  back for love. Mann avoids the obvious, which is delightfully  refreshing.<br />This book is a very easy read, and one that you won't want to  put down. In fact, I hope this book propels people to start looking at the  early history of film once again, not as an archaic dinosaur, but as a  living, thriving, and very real entity as symbolized by the lovely Flo.<br />I  heartily recommend this book!	2000-07-10

He paints for us a picture of Hollywood in its hey-day, and in the aftermath  of scandal. He allows us insight into the fascinating world of silent  films. But mostly, he gives us a long forgotten but much endearing star,  Billy Haines.<br />Prior to reading this book,I knew nothing about Billy  Haines and his remarkable career, and I am somewhat of a movie buff. Billy  once was an MGM top star, and the #1 Movie Star in 1928, only to give it  all away for love. He went on to become one of Hollywood's most respected  interior decorators, styling the homes of many stars and even an occasional  conservative politician! What makes Billy full of class is not his brief  but glorious movie career, but his attitude towards his life and  love.<br />Through Mann's extraordinary research, thorough examination of  sources, and testimonials, he brings to us the life of an incredible  person. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enojys biographies, or  life stories!	2000-07-04

In order to protect the  vestiges of perfection, the town must bring order, even outside their  boundaries, to a group of threatening but very non-threating women.<br />On a  deeper level, this story attempts to shine light on the power of mythology  and stories in our culture, and how much they change from the real events.  People looking for plot and facts, and a predictable story with a  beginning, middle, and end, you will soon become confused, for Morrison  purposefully contradicts herself throughout the story.

Complete with juicy  gossip, personal details, and an excellent examination of the impetus  behind the creation of the story, Staggs brings us into, in front of, and  behind this motion picture. After only seeing it once, I immediately  purchased the DVD copy for my own library, if only to watch the amazing  Bette Davis utter her famous line: &quot;Fasten your seat belts, it's going  to be a bumpy night&quot;.<br />However, this book is a good example of  fan-mania to the extreme. Stagg obviously loves the film. but needed to be  a little bit more selective in the information he shared with us. Did we  really need to know about Zsa Zsa Gabor's real hair color in 1950? (he  mentions it several times). Or a transcript of what I gather to be gay men  talking about the film (it went on for three pages). I nearly stopped  reading the book altogether when he launched into several adult films that  borrowed their title and/or plot from the movie (which shall remain  unmentioned here!). Selectivity could have made the book tighter, better,  and easily, 100 pages less.	2000-06-08

It might be so tempting to  pigeon-hole this book into convienient, politically incorrect categories  (as several reviews have shown; to which I qiuckly respond: why are you  reading this book in the first place?), but in doing so, the true message  and meaning of the story is missed. This isn't a book about two gay men  adopting a child, this book really is about adopting a child, and the joys  and pains and complexities of child-raising. To me, the fact that a gay man  is doing the adopting was secondary, but still an important part of the  story.<br />For anyone, the path of adoption is complicated and  emotionally-charged, as Jesse so brilliantly captures in his book. He  covers all the usual bases in his story (how to conceive a child, the  conservative world that may fight him tooth and nail, personal childhood  stories) but does it in a poetic, wordy manner that forces us as readers to  slow down and feast.<br />I highly recommend this book, along with &quot;The  Kid&quot; by Dan Savage, for anyone of any sexuality wanting to adopt a  child in today's complex world.	2000-06-03

I appreciated Glaser's straightforward (no  pun intended) approach to spirtuality, and found many spots for  self-reflection throughout this book.<br />Especially powerful for me was  Glaser's recounting of Biblical stories that support &quot;coming  out&quot;. His assertion that a central theme in life is &quot;coming  out&quot; is very true, and shown time and time again through Biblical  stories, from Adam and Eve to Paul. His point that God, through the Old  Testament, is virtually unknowable to us mere humans, and that he himself  &quot;comes out&quot; through the personage of Jesus Christ is both  revelationary and comforting to me.<br />It continouslly impressed me that as  Glaser was writing this book, he himself was falling under scrunity and  controversy from his congregation and religion, who were struggling with  gay issues. Yet, he maintains his composure, his focus, and his desire to  show that being gay and being Christian are very compatable, despite the  gross misinterpretation and societal pressure plays in those roles.<br />Three  cheers for &quot;Coming Out as Sacrament&quot;, a must read.	2000-05-22

James Bradley manages  in his excellent work to take us not only behind the scenes of one of the  most famous photographs in history, but also behind the scenes of the  workings of a father/son relationship. After having just recently lost my  own father to cancer, it somehow in a reflective way brought me closer to  him. A perfect gift, not only for Memorial Day, but also for Father's Day.<br />Even if you are not a big reader of war literature, I cannot recommend  &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; highly enough.	2000-05-10

The reason I bought this book was because an astute critic assured me that this book would resemble a favorite author of mine, Michael Cunningham. Unfortunately, that proved to be somewhat misleading. The only plausible  and somewhat interesting character is the narrator, Evan, who is allowed to  break out of stereotypical roles and offer to us insights into his  mind.<br />Everytime I felt like I was getting hooked into the story,  something somewhat unbelievable and predictable pulled me away.<br />Good  attempt for gay fiction, not enough for interest.<br />I honestly didn't  expect much from Lawnboy, and received exactly that. I found little to be  challenged by in this story, and most of the characters somewhat unfounded  and cardboard.	2000-05-06

Gerald Clarke tackles a very difficult subject, Judy Garland, in his newest biography &quot;Get Happy&quot;. We all realize that probably one of the most complex lives in modern times has been that of Judy herself. She  was a singer extraordinaire, gifted actress, beautiful woman, and a human,  none-the-less. What Clarke's biography manages to capture is her humanness.  There is a succinct danger in deifying someone so much that they lose those  essential qualities that endear us to them in the first place. Judy was  troubled, had drug issues, marital problems, all true and well-documented,  and she also could belt out a song like no one else. I loved Judy Garland  since childhood, and now, knowing her foibles and follies as well as her  gifts, makes me love her all the more.<br />Clarke's book moves very quickly.  He doesn't dally on any points, and the chapters are organized into short  sections. I rated it four stars because I wished he had &quot;dallied&quot;  a little bit more in certain areas, especially in her later singing career!	2000-04-13

US	52223520	REULF43HFBF4V	0684867192	792974017	Scandalmonger: A Novel	Books	4	16	20	N	Y	An intriguing, difficult read	William Safire attemps in his latest tome, &quot;Scandalmonger&quot; to bring us to the 'gates' of the founding of our country by illuminating scandals that plagued the Founding Fathers. Ah, to sit back and reminisce  about the olden days, and how perfect everything was back then. Balderdash.  As Safire points out, early American politics were strife with gossip,  rumors, and a media out for blood. It's makes that whole Clinton thing pale  in comparison to adulterous behavior, extortion, and other juicy tidbits  which shaped our destiny, almost bringing down the Nation as well.<br />Not  five stars because of a challenging read, Safire often sprinkles names  throughout the story that I found sometimes confusing. For the casual  history buff, or the more experienced devotee, &quot;Scandalmonger&quot; is  sure to please!	2000-03-25

While simple in thier construction, the poems express adequately all the dimensions of  being a kid; from school to hating squash. Graves claims he wrote some of  the poems specifically for boys to identify with, but don't be fooled, this  gem is applicable to all. VERY usuable in the classroom and with children -  a must read.	2000-03-25

Christopher Paul Curtis' new book &quot;But, not Buddy&quot; magically accomplishes so much in a book that as a teacher, your head will spin. First and foremost, Curtis picks up the ball of yarn so magically spun in  his first classic, &quot;Watson Go to Birmingham&quot; and manages,  impossibly so, to create an even more endearing, serious novel. I have  LONGED for a book with African-American characters where the color of their  skin wasn't the reason for the plot, but a part of the plot. Curtis tackles  obvious racism, and a range of other issues like homelessness, poverty,  familial issues, and the Great Depression that you're head will be spinning  with the connections you can draw in this book. Bud-not-Buddy is such a  true child that you are convinced he is real, as well as the wonderful cast  of characters Curtis created. To learn about Curtis' own life and how he  became an author is to appreciate his gifts of literature even more. DO NOT  pass up this book, teachers, and use it for years to come!	2000-02-05

I picked up this work walking along a table in a nationally known book chain. A plain looking cover, so unlike all the plethora of self-help books out there with a figure plastered on the front. The content is also  different. Unlike books that proclaim &quot;The Ten Best Ways to...&quot;  or &quot;The Ten Stupid Things that...&quot;, this book offer practical and  real help! In this incredible tome, LeCompte pulls together 25 years of  study and research into why we behave the way we do, and what we can do  about it. His premise is much of our daily actions and reactions are a  result of our unconscious, based on our often inaccurate judgments of the  event. He manages to cover the work of Freud, and the latest research in  unconscious programing in a simple, easy to understand, and practical way!  Don't be fooled by the books title; I found this book helped ME out so much  personally, and how I began to deal with the complexities in the  relationships around me. I am a better person for this work, and you will  be as well.	2000-01-13

As a schoolteacher, I've loved sharing the odd tales of Louis Sachar with my students. He is one of the few children's authors that I love to read as much as the children do. His sense of humor  is impeccable as well as his imagination. That is why I was thrilled to  learn that &quot;Holes&quot; had gone on to win several top-notch prizes;  the Newbury being the crown jewel.<br />That was until I read this book.  Although wildly inventive, strange, and unpredictable, I found very little  to grab hold to really enjoy this story. While the story is complex and the  characters steeped in history, it seems to be flawed in the only sense that  I never really identified with any of them. They seemed to be too remote,  too wild for me to buy into the premise.<br />I long suspect that awards such  as Oscars, Emmys, and Newburys, are given to authors for the span of their  career and not always the work that is being honored. If that is the case,  Louis Sachar is long deserving of this wonderful recognition. However, I  wished he had won the award for one of his brilliant, off the wall  &quot;Wayside School&quot; novels.<br />In this case, &quot;Holes&quot; has  too many holes for me to recommend it.	1999-12-28

In Dan Savage's &quot;The Kid&quot;, he and his partner Terry explore the incredibly complex, issue-laden world of adoption. With Dan's usual brutal honesty, queer-influenced thought patterns, and unique insights, we are  exposed to the highs and lows of the choice of adoption, no matter what  your sexuality. At first, I found the book an egostical diatribe of usual  gay-themed fodder with which we are bombarded. Fortunately, Dan warms up to  us as he warms up to the idea of being a dad, and the marriage is a happy  one indeed. I came to appreciate, and even love, the little story of these  two men trying to wrestle a child into this world, no matter what value you  place on their intentions. They prove, once and time again, that the  struggles of gay couples in today's society are exactly the same as hetero  couples... and that's how it should be. Kudos to Dan and Terry for becoming  parents; I wonder if DJ knows how blessed he truly is.	1999-10-18

The lofty  challenge was met by this stunning work of verbal artistry. Never before  has a book so entirely captured me, refusing to let go; allowing me to  wander through the words as if tasting a fine wine or a rich banquet  prepared for my convienience. Michael Cunningham has produced a complex,  thoroughly wonderful narrative that challenges the formulaic writing so  prevalient today. His gift to literature shall never be, as Clarissa fears  about Richard's poetry, forgotten, but a benchmark of the highest order for  any author to aspire to meet. &quot;The Hours&quot; is a gift to the world,  and any reader destined to cross its path.	1999-10-05
