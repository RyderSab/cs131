This is a long review, but I hope you hang in there.<br />Just to put everything in context, I've bought the<BR>following golf books in the last few months:<br />How to Break 90 (Tomasi, et al)<BR>The 30-Second Golf Swing (Tomasi)<BR>Five Fundamentals (Hogan)<BR>Five Fundamentals (Elkington)<br />Plus I've flipped through dozens of books in the<BR>store. And I've visited every golf site know to man.<BR>Or woman.<br />We're talking minimal improvement after 2 months<BR>of hard work -- and I'm a fairly gifted athlete, modesty<BR>aside.<br />Minimal improvement and not much joy. And this is<BR>a game I used to LOVE in my teens.<br />Minimal improvement.<br />And just in case you thought I was looking for instant<BR>mastery, I'm not. There's no such thing anyway.<br />But I WAS looking for a ray of hope. A ray that says,<BR>\\"If you stick to this general way, improvements and<BR>a sense of accomplishment WILL come with time.\\"<br />Enter \\"Extraordinary Golf.\\" <br />Read it a couple of days ago with a growing sense<BR>of excitement.<br />This morning I tried some of Shoemaker's <BR>awareness/concentration exercises down in the <BR>basement for 45 minutes. (Then started making up <BR>some of my own!)<br />Was CONSISTENTLY making 30-foot chips to within<BR>about 18 inches of the \\"hole\\". And sometimes IN THE<BR>HOLE.<br />I'm talking about 95 out of 100 very very good shots,<BR>(to within 2 or 3 feet) simply by PAYING ATTENTION<BR>to what was going on, NOT trying to fix anything, and <BR>simply having FUN.<br />I know you may think you're a technique player, but listen<BR>to this:<br />I started playing shots leaning waaay forward, waaay backward,<BR>on my left leg only, on my right leg only, holding the club miles <BR>from my body, in too tight, up against the wall, with the left hand<BR>only, with the right hand only, all sorts of crazy contortions -- <BR>AND WAS STILL KNOCKING THEM CLOSE TO THE HOLE!!!<br />Simply by paying FULL attention to what I was doing (primarily<BR>the FULL arc of the clubhead) in an easy, free-spirited way.<br />Shoemaker is right. Most players DON'T concentrate for the full<BR>2 seconds it takes to swing. Their minds are filled with all sorts of<BR>distractions and FEARS. Especially the fear of looking bad.<br />But when you just step up with full awareness in a spirit of inquiry,<BR>open to any possibility, not fixated on results, it is remarkable what happens.<br />This stuff actually works!<br />I discovered that I \\"lose\\" the clubhead near the top of my backswing.<BR>I suddenly lose awareness of it. But when I calmly maintain focus on<BR>where the clubhead is THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SWING and<BR>FORGET ABOUT THE RESULTS amazing things happen.<br />I also found out I\\"lose\\" the clubhead when I putt.<br />So I decided to line up a 35-foot putt while MAINTAINING AWARENESS<BR>in the clubhead.<br />The FIRST putt ended up ONE INCH from the hole.<br />The SECOND putt ended up TWO INCHES from the hole.<br />The \\"trick\\" if there is one, is to FORGET about FIXING and start<BR>OBSERVING what you're DOING.<br />Even if you miss every putt and every chip while you practice, even<BR>if your shots miss by a mile, THE MAIN THING IS YOU STAY AWARE<BR>OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR THE ENTIRE 2 SECONDS.<br />That should be your only concern. \\"Can I track the cluubhead <BR>throughout the entire swing?\\"<br />Even if you try hitting the ball backwards through your legs, if you <BR>pay full attention to the clubhead you'll putt it or chip it pretty close.<br />The technique therefore is how you use your brain! How you pay<BR>attention. And how you let go.<br />I demonstrated this morning that where you place your foot, where you<BR>place your weight, where you grip the club, etc. is NOWHERE NEAR<BR>AS IMPORTANT AS BEING AWARE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING.<br />Exercises:<br />1. Try Shoemakers mesmerizing \\"club-throwing\\" technique (you'll <BR>discover your natural timing this way) ...<br />and also try:<br />2. Paying full attention to, say,the full arc of the clubhead<BR>paying NO REGARD WHATSOEVER to where the ball goes. <BR>Just observe your awareness with the clubhead.<br />Shoemaker is operating in a field of elite mind/body practitioners,<BR>a field of geniuses who know true power lies in the STUDENT'S<BR>HANDS. These coaches/artists include Lorin Roche (grab all his meditation books) and George Leonard (grab all his books) and others. <br />You won't regret it.	2002-12-11

Is this book any good? Well lemme put it this way. I read it once or twice back in the mid 80s when I was a teenager.

(c) i've also taught the mindmapping technique to dozens of people, including such diverse groups as advertising execs and 5th graders. (d) they've all benefitted enormously. why? because the mindmapping technique serves to BOOST YOUR CREATIVITY AND UNLEASH YOUR FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. so any person who complains that this book is strictly about learning to write poetry is being VERY SMALL-MINDED INDEED! i suggest these people do a mindmap ON MINDMAPS THEMSELVES (!) and see what comes up!

So here, then, without much headscratching are my top 10 reasons for loving \\"Meditation Secrets for Women\\" with all my heart:<br />1. \\"Meditation Secrets for Women\\" is supremely easy reading. Its 292 pages (much meatier - and juicier! - than most meditation books) fly. Now this may not be important to some people, but, heck, who wants to battle through a dry, arid wasteland of intellectual ramblings? Fortunately, you'll find no such thing here. The writing is by turns funny, serious, sensuous, electrifying, and poetic, but never less than wise.<br />2. \\"Meditation Secrets for Women\\" is carefully broken down into 12 easily digestible chapters, with each chapter covering exactly one secret. <br />3. Secret. That's the key word. \\"Are they really `secrets',\\" you may wonder, \\"or is this just some hokey scam to get me to fork over my hard-earned dough?\\" No, they're secrets, all right. Not the kind of hush-hush secrets that have been passed down from master to pupil for thousands of years (far from it, in fact, as you will soon see), but the kinds of secrets that have been denied women too long.<br />4. You see the sad fact is that many contemporary women (and men!) have been taught meditation techniques designed for monks over a thousand years ago. And as the authors quite rightly point out, these techniques aren't just plain irrelevant to life in the 21st century, they're highly dangerous as well. If you've ever tried meditating to \\"kill your ego,\\" \\"block your desires,\\" \\"blunt your instincts,\\" or \\"purge your mind of all thoughts,\\" (to name just a few toxic objectives) you know how devitalizing and dehumanizing this type of meditation can be.<br />5. I'm delighted to say the authors Camille Maurine and Lorin Roche espouse a completely different kind of meditation. At last, here is approach full of love, joy, spontaneity, movement, sensuality, sexuality, daring, honesty, tenderness, instinct, passion, pleasure, adventure, and - last but certainly not least - FUN! I know this for a fact because I have been meditating under Lorin's tutelage for over a year, ever since reading his truly wonderful, \\"Meditation Made Easy,\\" a beautiful and indispensible companion to \\"Secrets.\\"<br />6. \\"Meditation Secrets for Women\\" provides not just one or two or even three meditations, but quite literally dozens, so you can pick and choose what suits your mood or temperament at any given time. I happen to stick to my favorite \\"Do Nothing\\" meditation, but occasionally switch to some other technique (or make up my own, which the authors heartily encourage) if the mood calls for it. And naturally all the meditations in the book are based on the same simple premise: meditation is fun and natural.<br />7. Also provided is a superb reference list (organized by chapter) for those who wish to delve even deeper into special areas of interest. Plus there's an invaluable listing of musical recommendations.<br />8. \\"Meditation Secrets for Women\\" is IDEAL for women AND men, beginners AND advanced meditators. There really is something here for everyone. And like all classic books (and this book will become a classic) it grows with you. Meaning, the more you explore your meditation, the more jewels the book reveals. A small aside: As a teenager I was poisoned by a couple of meditation books still available on the shelves today. Among many of their deflating techniques was this godawful drudgery: staring at an object for long periods of time while trying to banish all thoughts from your head. Try it. I guarantee you'll make yourself miserable!  <br />9. So if you get just one thing out of this book it's that thoughts are good! Your brain, your body, your desires, your instincts, your universe, and yes, even your fears are good. \\"Meditation Secrets for Women\\" will give you the tools to observe these things from a position of great safety and serenity so that you can learn from them and experience more joy and peace and beauty and insight than you imagined possible. So that life itself can become your greatest teacher, and that you yourself can become the blazer of your own wonderful trails. <br />10. If you read this book today, chances are you'll be happily meditating a year from now and loving it. What else can you ask for?	2001-02-20

(i also love garrett's &quot;the art of black and white photography&quot;). peterson simply takes the confusion out of photography -- so you can focus on what really matter: framing the shot. you want to be able to understand what you're doing, so you can do it without thinking. peterson's books are a stepping stone to that level of awareness. and of course, you must shoot, shoot, shoot. i took 5,000 shots the year i read &quot;learning to see creatively&quot; -- a testament to the infectious enthusiasm peterson brings to his subject...good luck. and thank you, mr.peterson!	2000-06-16

Sitting on my shelf are, oh, about 30 books on advertising. Maybe more. Ironically, &quot;The Copy Book&quot; isn't one of them -- it's too damn large! So it lays kinda slouched against the wall. But not for long, 'cos  that baby tends to spend an obscene amount of time in my hands. And yes, as  some other reviewer points out, Neil French is in sparkling form -- what's  new? --, dispensing advice you wouldn't read about (Australian expression)  -- except here. Abbott ... amazing. Steve Henry. Jim Durfee. Richard Foster  (great essay!) They're all here and more. A must-read several times over.  Ads are a little dated, but so what? The advice is priceless.	2000-03-09

(1) start the book. (2) finish the book. (3) watch what happens. if you're still thinking about the book 3  months later you could say it was a good book. a very good book. if you're  still thinking about it 12 months later, well, you have something very  special on your hands. if you're still thinking of the book YEARS later,  congratulations, you have a classic. which brings us to &quot;Genji.&quot;  have to admit, at first i was daunted by its size and complexity (puette's  guide is a must). have to admit, i didn't particularly admire the main  character much, either. have to admit, there were times i got bored. have  to admit, i fell in love with murasaki (what a woman!). and finally, have  to admit, i was glad to finally put it down, about 2 or 3 months after  picking the thing up. but, of course, in a sense i never really put it  down, because the damn thing keeps going through my head! and as time goes  by i miss my &quot;friends.&quot; i even miss that old hornbag genji!	2000-03-02

I read this pathetic piece of rubbish about a year ago and every time I pass it on the shelves I want to punch it. Fat  lot of good that'd do. Maybe I'll just burn the copy I have. Not because  it's so bad, but because Hornby is clearly a smart guy, can string words  together, and yet concocted this god-awful tripe. Frustrating waste of  talent.	2000-02-28
