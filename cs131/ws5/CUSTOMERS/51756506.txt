When this book was recommended to me, I was a bit skeptical--I couldn't imagine what the author could say that i hadn't already figured for myself.  But it was something more, something different.  The book helped me to understand better how my husband and I had been coming part for so long, and it also showed me that I'm nowhere near alone.  I should point out though that this book does not hold back for the benefit of the emotionally weak.  I read it in the mindframe that my relationship was over, so maybe some of the brutal truths seemed a little less brutal as I'd already lived them.  Overall, I'd say this is recommended reading for anyone in any kind of intimate relationship--its toughness is just an accurate mirror of reality.	2001-09-29

On that point, I need to mention that I did enjoy The Elusive Flame.  But now I wasted my time trudging through A Season Beyond--set some twenty years before the previous sequel, if you can follow that--and the only thing I can think is that Woodiwiss is either making an effort for immortality or is simply in it for the money.<br />Okay, I think it's the money.  Good thing I got this dud from the library instead of wasting money along with my time.<br />Woodiwiss has always been a little too purple in her prose for my tastes, but her writing in this novel is down rotten and her decriptions are ludicrous.  What was the line about the sun weaning from its teat of earth as a description of the sunrise?<br />Kathleen, if you ever get the urge to type the name &quot;Birmingham&quot; in a manuscript again, scourge yourself.  This story thread is dead, so please bury it.	2001-09-11

Its power is so built up by the people who have spent time thinking about it that in turn, it has become a significant work of the occult.  All theories aside, I enjoyed the Necronomicon just as a book--it's a great read, and one I recommend to anyone who likes their literature on the unusual side.	2001-07-25

I picked up this book on a recommendation and had some rather high hopes.  Unfortunately, I felt absolutely nothing.  You might say &quot;Oh, well, she's not in the trad, how does she know?&quot;  I'm comparing the experience of reading Fitch's book to reading the Poetic and Prose Eddas in addition to other works on the Teutonic way which did capture my interest and imagination.  Perhaps if you're a seeker looking to Nordic ways you may find this book of greater value than I did, but I do not feel this is a good choice for the person seeking to broaden their background.	2001-07-25

I mourned MZB's passing in 1999, but also saw it as the end of the ongoing slew of Mists prequels which were, so far as I'm concerned, detrimental to the lustre of the original.<br />Now I get slapped with Priestess of Avalon.  No, I did not like it, and yes, I could detect the absence of MZB's thought and skill.  To be honest, I have a hard time fitting this one into the Avalon series--what with its first person narrative and overall different feeling.  There's not much of a story here at all--and after reading Forest House and Lady of Avalon, that's pretty bad.  In sum, I suspect the publishers sought to link MZB and Avalon one more time in search for the almighty dollar.  That, I think, is the biggest shame of all.	2001-06-11

Any novel--especially one of this size--that divides characters up like soldiers on a battlefield seems too fundamentally simple.  In this case, it's the good, wise, mistreated Pagans of the Old Religion against the blundering, ignorant, and somewhat blind avatars of Christianity.  The character of Morgaine, who's a rampant Goddess worship fundamentalist if ever there was one, is just as bad as Gwenyfhar and her endless pious Christian rantings.  The supporting cast is little better and made up mostly of fence-sitters.<br />Having come to know Arthur through White and Mallory, I missed the emphasis on the new kind of law and legal philosophy Arthur was supposed to have brought with him.  It's a personal thing, but debates about legal issues (and more importantly, changing people's outlooks) are a lot more interesting than endless pecking over spirituality.  Granted, Mists was supposed to move the legends away from these things, but I'm not sure it's not &quot;these things&quot; which make the Arthurian legends what they are.	2001-06-11

Don Juan is not about teaching US this &quot;Yaqui Way of Knowledge&quot;, but rather the unique story between a sorcerer-teacher and an eager student.<br />Ladies and gentlemen, I for one know with a preternatural certainty that Don Juan is not fiction.  Let me say the shamanic experiences described herein ring true to me in recollection of my own visions and travels, and let's leave it at that.<br />Carlos Castaneda was a brilliant man.  This is most obvious in his writing.  After all, this is not the simplest topic in the world to write about, and yet Castaneda did so with wit, verve, and style.  I especially appreciate how Don Juan is divided into two parts, experiential and academic (Castaneda was a graduate student at the time).<br />Someone said to me that Castaneda was &quot;trite&quot; compared to authors like Depak Chopra (cough cough).  I'd believe that this person simply was unable to &quot;get&quot; Castaneda--maybe Don Juan was too intense and too earthy.  Draw your own conclusions.	2001-06-11

Can you do that?  If so, you're ready to embrace everything this book has to offer without the weight of societal prejudice to weigh you down.<br />This book isn't talking about hating deity or being the Antichrist or any kind of dross like that.  Shock of shocks--this is a book of PHILOSOPHY.  Whether LaVey himself originally conceived of these ideas or not is unimportant; he did write them down so that you and I could use our own minds to read, ponder, and draw our own conclusions.<br />Here's my tip, folks.  LaVey has five Satanic tomes to his credit.  Most people begin with the Satanic Bible, but I think this is a mistake.  If you are just beginning to explore LaVey's world, read the Devil's Notebook or Satan Speaks! before attempting this one.  I say this because the other books are examples of philosophy in action, and the Satanic Bible might be clearer for a reader with this background.<br />And if you get easily offended at the word &quot;Satanic&quot;, remember there are plenty of people around who would get offended by the word &quot;Bible&quot;.	2001-06-11

Do you realize that the author is perhaps the foremost authority on Esperanto in North America and perhaps even the world?  Do you think for a moment that ELNA does not know, condone, or appreciate this author for advocating the learning and speaking of Esperanto?  Personally, I didn't find fault that the vocabulary was a litte less haughty and a whole lot more like the way human beings actually communicate.  I would also suggest that the &quot;serious student&quot; go find another language to smack around for a while--Esperanto was INVENTED to be PRACTICAL.  Esperanto is a tool--and a useful tool at that--for international communication, and this is where I see the emphasis in this particular work.  That is what recommends this book in my opinion.	2001-04-25

THERE'S JUST ME.&quot;	As I am a fan and a student of the anthropomorphic personification of Death, my friends had been urging me to read Mort for a good while before I finally got around to doing so.  Quite literally, the book remained in my hands from the moment I began reading until the last flush of print.  Novels like Mort and On A Pale Horse by Piers Anthony are much more culturally significant than I believe they are credited, for they take the dreaded inevitible of humanity--death--and turn it into something rational, comprehensible, and even downright human.  Mort is an affable sort, but Death is a heck of a guy and a colorful character, whether in bones and black cloth or not.  The notion of Death seeking a taste of the mortal when so much fiction goes the other way around is very refreshing.  Be advised, though, that you should go into reading Mort with the Fantasy Punnster Mindset firmly in place for maximum enjoyment.	2001-04-07

This &quot;study&quot; is a gem with as many facets as there are stars in the Haitian night sky.  For the scientific mind, there is the search for the mysterious &quot;zombi powder&quot;, and the even more incredible evidence for its existence.  For the ethnoculturalist, there is an empathic and vibrant inside look into Haitian society and more importantly, what it means to be Haitian.  For the student of religion, there is a complete and opne treatment of the Vodoun faith, both beautiful and terrifying and all of the universe in between.  These points and much more are woven together by a narrative which is fast-paced and exciting to digest.  By the end of the book, I truly felt as if the people I had met between its pages were people I cared about and people I knew.  For an eye-opening reading experience, I'm hard put to think of a better treat.	2001-04-07

The first thing I can say about Arabella Grey is that she is unique among the hallowed halls of Bertrice Small heroines.  Right from her introduction, Arabella is a different creature.  She is intelligent in an academic way but also possesses a more primal and intuitive kind of intelligence.  One of the things I enjoyed most about this book were the intricate paths of logic which were so central to Arabella's character.  Yes, she understands things--but moreover, the reader gets into her working mind to see just how she reaches the shocking and surprising conclusions she does.  Bear in mind that this is not a typical historical romance.  Small's panorama of historicity is complex and detailed.  Additionally, I saw this less as a tale between a man and a woman and more of the story of a brave and independent female charting her own destiny through a difficult time and social climate.	2001-04-07

This is a great shame, because its predecessor is a good introduction to Wicca.  Living Wicca seems like less of a guide to developing a Wicca of one's own, and more like Wicca the Cunningham Way.  The author loops and swirls and writes all over the place save directly and coherently.  It's my conviction that a fledgling Wiccan would be far better off working their imaginations than being spoonfed by this book.  Oh, and if you look closely, you might notice all of the white space in the pages.  It's true, this book has nothing much to say.	2001-03-24

The &quot;dark&quot; in Dark Fires is most appropriate.  What I really appreciated in this novel, apart from some gripping storytelling, was Rogers' treatment of substance abuse in the latter half of the Nineteenth Century.  There's nothing pretty about it, and I think it's important to point out that abuse is not just a modern phenomenon.  I also admire the way Rogers treats the simple fact that people change and develop as a result of their experiences--and also that one can become stronger through adversity.	2001-03-24

Most of all, I thought this was a good, straightforward story, lighter on the erotica and more centered on the plot.	2001-03-23

Wicca is NOT the Brujeria of today--there's already a longstanding tradition called Brujeria which remains the Brujeria of today, thank you.  The text is obviously a rote translation from English into Spanglish, with all of the fire of a Babelfish translation.

Mind you, this is not a tome of light verse, but rather it is a love song to the Angel of Death, Azrael.  Separate poems weave into one beatiful whole.  This isn't the kind of book one reads from beginning to end (I don't think any book of poetry is).  Eros In Exile entices you to pick it up, read a bit, and then reflect.

This Lord Roderick has supposedly killed two wives when they fail to give him sons.  All right.  Now he's angling on Wife #3, whom he has left pure and virginal while he goes off to do whatever it was that important Welsh lords did.  In a frenzy, and detecting a pattern in her husband, Lady Gwynn first drags her midwife into her chamber to check her for pregnancy (was she expecting that you-know-who was coming back).  Imagine a lusty young thief beer goggling tha lady during the useless exam...and then being invited to spend three days in her bed so that she might get pregnant and pass the kid off as her husband's (assuming her husband is stupid enough to forget he's never slept with his wife).  Okay, right there the book was ruined for me--Gwynn proves early on that she's too stupid (or clueless) to make a good heroine.  Dark Ruby is readable, even if it isn't particularly likeable.

I go back over this one and try counting the things she can't do, and gosh darn, it seems like she can master everything.  Okay, granted, maybe this isn't a bad ideal for a character.  But the one thing I always look for in a character and I found lacking in Skye is the human element.  Sure, she goes through a lot, but it always seems to get patched up by her fabulous jewels or her wealth or her off-the-scale beauty.

Buckland's full of himself and a lot of other stuff, too, and this comes across in the pages of this book.  For starters, it is the most pompous and boring book on the Craft I have ever read.  His &quot;style&quot; is stiff with an almost touch-me-not aura.  Let me also point out that this is no book on general witchcraft.  It is a tome on the brand of the Craft Buckland invented himself, Seax Wicca, and won't be every witch's cup of brew.  I'm always amazed at how any book on the Craft can lack passion, and this is the most passionless out there.  Should I even mention the ritual bondage associated with initiation?  Symbolism, sure.  Bondage is bondage and has no place in a practice where all are equal.  Read this if you must but please supplement it with other more liberal renderings of the Craft.	2001-02-28

Have the Wicca fought for all these years to be recognized as a legitimate religion only to have the path relegated to books with the eye-appeal of a tabloid?  Sure, a book about sacred sexuality and love magic is great.  But calling this Wicca for Lovers is tantamount to having a Christianity, Judaism, Islam, etc. for lovers.

Very simply, this is a well-written book with a lot of promise, but it bored me to death.  I was so numbed by the dullness of the narrative that when the erotic parts came along, I barely even noticed them.  &quot;Belle from Hell&quot; is a cute moniker but a little too predictable, and to be honest I don't see where the character lives up to it (although she is indeed a strong woman).  The whole king-orders-man-marry-woman thing is too been there, done that, got the t-shirt.  Maybe the sport of raising hunting birds is interesting to some, but I suspect the taste of it could have been given without going into such painful detail.  When the threads of the novel began spinning in Brittany with knock-offs of mishapen Arthurian characters, I took a deep breath and prepared to be rolling my eyes.  What really bothers me is that I wanted to like this book, I really did.  But what can I tell you?  Eroticism or not, Hellion was one long dull read for me.	2001-02-28

I'm not sure this book is bad so much as it is only ridiculous.  Having read Sweet Savage Eden, I was curious about its sequel, and that curiosity did not pay off for me.  A Pirate's Pleasure is a pale shimmer of its predecessor, with characters and dialogue so disparate from the first that I had to wonder if indeed the same author penned both books.  Any book in which the heart of a knight lies within the (perfect, of course) physique of a pirate immediately gets slated as &quot;humor&quot; in my mind.  On the bright side, at least some of the cover art isn't your typical Barbie doll stuff--the portrait of Skye Kinsdale on the spine and the back cover looks much like Sigourney Weaver after battling the aliens.

To equate the two with the weak link &quot;Brujeria and Wicca = witchcraft&quot; does not do justice to either path.

This is one of those books that you either get or you don't.  If you don't get it, you won't like it, or you'll find it deeply amusing--not that there's anything wrong with that.<br /><br />I also see the trouble in using the word \\"necromantic\\".  Readers might immediately jump to the idea of \\"necromancy\\", which is obtaining knowledge though communication with the dead.  What Wendell is talking about is communication with Death itself.<br /><br />Don't get the idea that this is some pop fad book of spells and concoctions.  The contents herein are volatile, powerful, and are not for the beginner in magic of any kind.  Wendell makes all of this perfectly  clear, of course, and weaves many warnings into the text.  I have and do  use the rites in this book, and all I dare tell you is that each working so  far has worked for me.

But this, this was no simple romance novel.  This book is a historical novel of the top flight.  Yeah, okay, there's (great) romance in it, but it isn't the pivot of the  plot.  The intrigues between Henry VIII, his &quot;Flanders mare&quot; Anne  of Cleves, his adulterous fifth wife Catherine Howard, and the over  ambitious Duke of Norfolk are the true players in this historical tale.

In the end, I have to dismiss this book as a try on MZB's part to simulate a romance novel.  Instead of subtlety I found  moments of melodrama.  The central romance was boring because Eilan and  Gaius were boring (and wishy-washy and conceited and totally without a clue  and...and...)  I can't stand books in which the characters think themselves  the center of the universe, and Forest House is full of these.  On a  smaller note, I found MZB's rendition of the Celtic Samhain into Samaine  very amusing and indicative of the care with which this book was written.  To top it off, this isn't even an original story--it's an interpretation of  the opera Norma.  Read if you must, but you might find having a grain of  salt and good humor to be assets.  For me personally The Forest House is  too full of the ridiculous to affect me any more than with a sour stomach.	2000-05-21

The Birminghams have outlived their novelty; this &quot;book&quot; is just a nightmare.  I am  angered to think that Woodiwiss is getting a paycheck off of name  recognition and not because she's putting any real talent into her work.  Granted, I have always disliked Woodiwiss and her caught-in-the-brambles  kind of prose.  But at least I could finish the other Woodiwiss novels I've  attempted.  This one is a travesty.  Note to authors--know when to leave  well enough alone and maintain your dignity.  Excuse me while I go shower  away this experience.	2000-05-19

She seems to not understand that West Virginia and Virginia are two different places.  All that aside, this is a book to pick you up out of your reading  doldrums--engrossing, witty, but not particularly frightening.	2000-04-07

There's barely any dialogue between the hero and the heroine in the whole book, let alone before their first tumble.  The plot is hackneyed, the &quot;futuristic&quot; names for  things as exciting as oatmeal.  No one has a personality other than  &quot;noble&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;resident magician&quot;.  If  you like overdone description without much storyline, you might enjoy this  travesty.	1999-05-11
