Have a cup of coffee and a couple of cookies to hand and ready to receive a nice little blessing? Well, think again. You are likely to choke on those cookies. No nice little blessings here, but rather some big, thought-jerking lessons leading to deep, maybe even uncomfortable, convictions.  <br /> <br />Upper-middle class college students Mike and Sam answered God's call, purchased very used back packs and sleeping bags and, for several months, joined the ranks of the homeless. This adventure was not an easy decision. Receiving much advice from Christian mentors, making sure they had prayer backing, these two guys started in Denver and by the time they hit Washington, DC, they knew what kind of hunger makes you eat out of trash cans.  <br /> <br />With a guitar and a modicum of talent, they sang gospel music on the streets to raise a little cash. Sometimes they ate 99 cent hamburgers. How long does it take for cement to become a comfortable bed? Where do you find washing and toilet facilities when businesses chase you from theirs? Just how dirty and smelly can a human become, and how fast? How do you handle sickness, injury, rampaging feelings? Which are more predominate, Christians and churches who ignore, chase, denigrate the grungy hopeless, or those who emulate their Lord by helping them? Are there Christians in dire need out there on the streets? What does it really mean to depend on the Lord for absolutely everything? Mike Yankoski knows the answers first hand.  <br /> <br />Not a missionary, nor a theologian, although he keeps in the Word, he shares his experiences in absolute simplicity with gritty, deep truth, never shielding us from the smells, hurts, shocks, and fears. With ruthless honesty, Mike, and Sam through him, share their homeless victories, tragedies, and despair. He compares Pharisaical Christians and Christ-like followers. He presents the homeless people they met on the streets: drug addicts, drunkards, families, couples, dog-owners, Christians, pagans, old, young. We might think of them as scum. Mike and Sam learned to know them as people, fearing some, loving many, praying for them all. Under the Overpass provides many suggestions for working with these people.  <br /> <br />Maybe God is calling you to do something that comfortable Christians consider unusual; Under the Overpass will encourage you immensely and help you set parameters for your adventure. Whether read individually, or for discussion in a group, middle school age through adults will gain through reading this book. - Donna Eggett, Christian Book Previews.com  <br />	2005-04-28

Whatever your translation preference or reading level, you can find a Bible that will best suit your needs.  <br /> <br />A Baptist minister in England, David Dewey provides critical evaluation of every conceivable Bible translation ever available, from traditional print, to eBibles, this reference can unpack the confusing and often daunting process of determining which Bible is best. Dewey ultimately asks, \\"Best for whom? And best for what?\\" These questions can guide a reader through the maze of form driven versus meaning driven translations. Before purchasing a Bible, Dewey recommends buyers read the preface to the translation they are considering, as it will provide valuable information on the translation style, notation usage, and reading level. Dewey encourages Bible students to have several translations employing the various translation methods and compare them, as no translation is without shortcomings. An issue Dewey raises is whether churning out new translations in the English language, essentially glutting the market-an American luxury-is the best way to spread the Good News. Perhaps translating it into other languages, which do not have a single copy of the Word, is a better use of mission funds.  <br /> <br />Readers will encounter such words as neologism, biblish, functional equivalence, optimal equivalence, and tautological. However, Dewey is never highbrow, but explains his terminology and logically presents his arguments, often employing tables for the reader to see what he means. The gender inclusive language controversy has an entire chapter. The author's seeming initial bent toward gender inclusivity is refreshingly abandoned in the chapter discussion. In the end, all issues are laid objectively at the reader's feet.  <br /> <br />This history of the Bible is enjoyable even for those committed to their current version. Deficits and merits of each translation are provided as well as the translation history, is it based on the Greek and Hebrew or Latin Vulgate? A basic description of each Bible's features is also included. I highly recommend this volume for laymen who may be in retail dealing with recommending Bibles to consumers, and to scholars for who this subject holds interest. It is an excellent read, well worth the effort. -- Suzanne Rae Deshchidn, Christian Book Previews.com  <br />	2005-04-28

This book is brimming with information, which is presented in a clear and concise way. With the recent portrayals of Jesus Christ in Hollywood-style movies and best-selling books, some truths about the Son of God may have gone astray. The authors will lead readers back to reality, with a full disclosure of all the facts.  <br /> <br />The topics covered are contemporary, cutting edge, and controversial. The authors begin with an in-depth look at the Jesus Seminar, where a group of people from all denominations met to decide what Jesus actually said and did. In a perfect circle of thought, this book ends by asking readers who they think Jesus is. And that's the motivation throughout all these pages. The authors are not trying to impress people with what they know; rather they want to impress people to know the Lord.  <br /> <br />In many ways, reading this book is like going on an archeological dig. Each page uncovers pertinent and documented evidence on a variety of subjects. Discussions on the Shroud of Turin and the James ossuary take a look at the past, while examining the implications for the present. The successful elements in popular books like The Da Vinci Code and Beyond Belief are contrasted with Scriptural accuracy.  <br /> <br />Some of the information that is presented here may be debatable in certain circles. If anything, this should encourage readers in further study, using the bibliography as a starting off point.  <br /> <br />However, it's very clear that Crucified in the Media was not written to incite or inflame, but to inform readers. The authors are to be commended for doing just that. -- Joyce Handzo, Christian Book Previews.com  <br />	2005-04-28

What's not to love about a curly-haired, freckle-faced \\"princess\\" with an attitude? Gigi had known from the day she was born that she was a princess-although she wasn't exactly sure why. With no castle or royal treasures, she didn't live like a princess. She had no subjects-even her cat didn't obey her. Yet, through this little story, Gigi learns that it is not the castle or the crown that makes a princess, but the declaration of the King-\\"you are God's little princess.\\"  <br /> <br />This simple message of belonging to \\"the greatest King of all\\" was created by Christian communicator, singer, and songwriter Sheila Walsh. Pink-loving princesses will love the whimsical illustrations by Meredith Johnson. Although royals of all ages may enjoy Gigi and her quest, its simple story line is probably geared to the youngest princesses who lay in wait for a bedtime story and a sweet reminder of God's gracious love. -- Susan Hammond, Christian Book Previews.com  <br />	2005-04-28

Dave Ramsey has been on so many TV interviews and has been profiled so often in newspapers, there just isn't much new left for him to say about his ultra-conservative approach to money management. So it is, then, that The Money Answer Book gives an easy-to-read distillation of all of the key Ramsey commandments for financial success. You can read the entire book in 90 minutes, even with time to pause occasionally to weigh a matter he is discussing. There are checklists to fill in for budgeting and goal setting; there are little hotboxes offering pithy quotations (\\"Well done is better than well said\\" - Ben Franklin); and there are biblical references within the text and in sidebars.  <br /> <br />Whether reading this 160 mini-book, listening to Ramsey on his radio show, or attending one of Ramsey's workshops, his bottom line always comes down to some very basic premises: (1) all credit cards are harmful; (2) people are in financial messes because they overspent, didn't plan, and lacked discipline; (3) everyone needs a fallback position of three to six months of reserve cash, food, and other necessities; (4) the outside economic picture has little influence on individual households that have learned to save, invest, budget, and tithe; and (5) there is nothing wrong with being incredibly wealthy so long as one uses his or her wealth appropriately.  <br /> <br />Sections of this book deal with brass tacks issues such as bankruptcy, divorce, estate planning, saving for college, and contract negotiations (don't become a co-signer is his main point on this last issue). However, to delve deeply into these areas Ramsey has longer, more explicit books, such as his best-seller Total Money Makeover. -- Dr. Dennis E.

The power of the cinematic media should never be overlooked. At its best, and even at its worst, it can mirror society, bring issues to awareness, and make us reflect on ourselves personally.  <br /> <br />Reflections for Movie Lovers by Matthew Kinne takes this influence to a new level. Consisting of 365 devotions, this book uses movies as its springboard for spiritual lessons and reflections. But beware, if you're an avid movie fan, as I am, your \\"to see\\" list will grow!  <br /> <br />Each devotion starts with two short Scripture readings, a paragraph summary of the movie's storyline, then moves into the spiritual application and reflection for our \\"real\\" lives. I used Reflections for Movie Lovers as part of my personal devotions, but this could also be used in family devotions, small group study, and in youth groups. The movie devotions are broken down into a particular topic/genre per week. Every genre is included so there's something for everyone.  <br /> <br />This book would be beneficial for young believers who love movies. Kinne does a great job at explaining the Bible lesson in a complete, simple, and concise way. You don't have to have a theological degree to understand the lesson. For example, Kinne retells the story of Israel's exodus from Egypt in 76 words, yet you understand what took place. If you want more information, the Bible reference is part of the scripture reading for the day.  <br /> <br />Kinne does a superb job at summarizing the movie storyline. I read the book before reading anything about the author, and based on his skill at condensing a two-hour movie into one paragraph, Kinne's involvement with the movie industry was obvious. His resume is impressive: a freelance writer and film/video producer. He served as a development director for Messenger Films, as the East Coast editor of Movieguide Magazine, written several screenplays, interviewed Hollywood stars, and consulted for film production companies.  <br /> <br />While some of the movies Kinne focuses on are R-rated, he states that it \\"doesn't mean I endorse it or agree with every little thing about it. Like all humanity, all movies portray sinners, usually depicting their sins. This doesn't mean I recommend that all Christians see all R-rated movies, as I believe that some people shouldn't see any at all. Your choice of viewing is between you and God - and your parents if you are under 17.\\" The benefit of this book is that you can get the story and lesson without having to see what you don't want to.  <br /> <br />Included in the heading of each devotion is the American Film Institute rating, the Academy Awards nominations and winners, the Motion Picture Association of American rating, and the year the movie was made.  <br /> <br />Some of the devotionals seemed a bit of a stretch, but the author himself admits that not every movie will resonate in the same fashion for all readers. Even so, Reflections for Movie Lovers is definitely a worthwhile read. -- Leilani Wells, Christian Book Previews.com  <br />	2005-04-28

John MacArthur is the general editor of this new book from Crossway, and contributing authors are several of his ministry associates.     The theme of the book is spiritual discernment; not set forth in a didactic way, but in a series of topical snapshots. Section one lays the foundation for the chapters to follow: a call for biblical discernment, and the consequences of a weak proclamation of Christianity. MacArthur makes the point that discernment is not just the responsibility of pastors and Christian leaders, but of every Christian. He covers the favorite verse of many in today's church: \\"Judge not, lest ye be judged.\\" (Matthew 7:1) and compares that with 1 Thessalonians 5:21: \\"Test everything.\\" In the second chapter he lists fifteen negative effects of superficial preaching, whittled down from an original list if sixty-one! My only reservation is with the twelfth point, and his comment about the difficulty of exercising church discipline where there is no commitment to the authority of God's Word. I'm not sure that very many churches even practice biblical church discipline, according to the teaching of Matthew 18:15-19. Perhaps a brief exposition of this passage, and an example of how this is practiced in his church is in order. The final two chapters of the book, \\"A Doctrinal Framework for Developing Discernment\\" and \\"A Practical Plan for Developing Personal Discernment\\" are excellent. I particularly appreciated the exhortation on page 201: \\"Discernment is not enough apart from obedience.\\"     The rest of the book is a series of chapters looking at current doctrinal trends in the church and in Christian books. The contributors cover such things as altar calls, contemporary worship music, Wild at Heart and The Purpose Driven Life, as well as politics and consumerism. This is a must-read, written in a clear, straightforward style. I have already loaned out my copy to two people, and one of my pastors is referring to it in the college Bible study he teaches. I heartily commend it to you. - Pam Glass, Christian Book Previews.com	2005-04-28

This book is hard-hitting and packs a punch. Yet, the author has been careful to research his facts, and includes extensive footnotes and a bibliography.  <br /> <br />Educating our nation's children is everyone's concern. Future leaders are sitting in classrooms today, and it's imperative that they receive a quality education. However, a close inspection of our schools reveals a disturbing and sometimes diabolical condition. From curriculum to corrective measures, the author clearly shows that the nation's education system is not deserving of a passing grade.  <br /> <br />This book is divided into two parts, with the first section dealing with the abuses found in today's classrooms. Each chapter slowly and systematically sorts through the facts and fallacies, until readers get a true sense of the education system. The author backs up his opinions with solid statistics, as well as by personal accounts of parents, teachers, and students.  <br /> <br />Although all of this information may alternately discourage or enrage readers, the author uses the last section of the book to give clear and practical options for educating children. Home schooling and Internet schools are explored with the same meticulous research that went into the first half of the book. Web sites and teaching materials are listed and critiqued. If anyone is seriously considering either of these educational options, the material presented here will provide a solid introduction.  <br /> <br />The author unequivocally equips readers to understand and evaluate the education system, so they can make wise decisions about their children's futures. This reviewer applauds the time and effort it took to bring this book to publication. Most interesting was the idea of education entering a free market system. In fact, the author, who is an education policy analyst, makes several comprehensive suggestions. These pages will certainly open up readers' minds to daring new ideas.  <br /> <br />This book gets top grades from this reviewer! -- Joyce Handzo, Christian Book Previews.com  <br />	2005-04-22

It's no secret that Jack Hayford has a way with words. In this book, he uses his creativity to richly describe what Christ came to do for us. Yet, the author takes readers beyond the suffering of Christ and into a more meaningful application of His visit. These pages will remind readers that the work of Christ did not end on the cross, but transcends time to bring us power for today. <br /> <br />Written in an orderly arrangement, the book begins by looking at the reasons why Jesus came. It then introduces various aspects of His divine visit and their implications to today's Christian. Each chapter begins with a vignette, followed by the voice of the author bringing another spiritual truth to the mind and heart of the reader. It seems as if every sentence pulsates with the breath of life. <br /> <br />The words used to describe the person and work of Christ are both penetrating and poignant. Readers will get a true sense of His love, His life and the liberation He provided. This book is a spiritually perceptive look into the most important event that ever happened on our planet. Gently enfolded in these pages is the power of a life that could not be held by death. Jack Hayford captured a moment in time and revealed its eternal significance to every one of us.  <br /> <br />May the words of The Divine Visitor find a home in every reader's heart. -- Joyce Handzo, Christian Book Previews.com <br />	2005-04-14

The main idea is to understand the audience and then tailor the message to their needs. Relevant is the key word here, and the author demonstrates this belief with Scripture verses, statistics and stirring personal accounts. <br /> <br />The book is easily arranged into compact informational chunks with eye-catching appeal. The chapters have the main points set apart from the text for easy reading and reference. Charts, diagrams and even clever cartoons grace the pages and help to creatively explain the author's teaching.

Books	5	2	2	N	N	Christian Book Previews	`Everyone and everything can be forgiven' is the theme of Julie Ann Barnhill's latest book, Radical Forgiveness. Many have condemned themselves so strongly in areas of their lives, that all hope has been lost for a complete cleansing. This book will show this just is not true.  <br /> <br />The use of scripture throughout the book assures beyond a shadow of a doubt that God's forgiveness is so radical, it covers even those hidden spots no one knows about. Julie speaks in such a conversational style you can almost hear her voice. You can picture her sitting next to you assuring that due to the forgiveness and grace waiting, sin confessed and turned from is a beautiful thing. Julie's honesty, vulnerability, and understanding of grace make her more than qualified to write this book.  <br /> <br />Leading by example, Julie shows how to face what we really need to face: we are a mess. She writes, \\"All of us need to embrace the messy reality of our existence, for nothing can happen until we admit it.\\" She leads us there by going first and revealing some of what makes her life a mess. She reveals fact and fiction about forgiveness, and how what we say and what we really mean sometimes are two completely different things. She then gives insight on how to master the mind games we play, and how real girlfriends can make our paths so much smoother.  <br /> <br />What an excellent book! Its strength lies in Julie's ability to relate simply one woman to another. She reveals that there is not one thing hidden that could be beyond God's willingness and desire to forgive. If you are a woman who has things concealed, if shame has a hold on any part of you, if you want a friend to help you understand how radical God's forgiveness really is, I suggest you read this book. -- Sheri Carlstrom, Christian Book Previews.com  <br />	2005-03-18

It was one of the most impacting novels I've read. Written tight, Turner boldly put a face on victimization. I frequently had to put the book down to catch my breath, but was soon drawn back to see what would happen next. That book earned great admiration for Turner, and when an acquaintance commented that Christian fiction often fell short of industry standard and life was too short for wimpy fiction, I sent her a copy.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />My first experience with Turner's work made me eager to read another book from this author. Readers will glimpse characters from Some Wildflower in My Heart in her latest in this fiction series, No Dark Valley.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I'm glad I read Some Wildflower in My Heart first, because No Dark Valley didn't grip me. The story wanders, and by chapter eight I was still in the dark about where the plot was going. Throughout the book I was distracted by long descriptions of characters that were not heard from again, nor necessary to the story. The mundane thoughts of the main characters got a lot of space, as well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />In an interesting style, the author takes the reader right up to an action point, and then changes scenes. The reader is left to think nothing happened until later, when Turner refers back to the action that happened right after the reader was moved away. Rather like leaving a movie theater before the show begins and having a friend who stayed tell you about the movie later. Her writing style in this book is a lot of telling, rather than showing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Throughout the narrative, Turner weaves in familiar hymn titles and lyrics. The last forty pages were my favorite part as she delivers action, a thinking and sensitive prince charming, and pokes good-humored fun at the writing clichs she dared to include. - PeggySue Wells, Christian Book Previews.com <br />	2004-08-18

However, in order to do that, each of us must set aside the time to come away and seek out the Father's presence; for though we know and believe that God is with us everywhere, still, we must learn be quiet and to shut out the noise of the world in order to listen instead to the voice of God. Then, and only then, can we be renewed and refreshed. Come Away My Beloved, written by Frances J. Roberts, is a devotional classic that seeks to help us do just that. In its updated form, it has the potential to minister to the hearts of a whole new generation of Christian believers.  <br /> <br />According to Adrian Rogers, Senior Pastor at Bellevue Baptist Church in Memphis Tennessee, \\"Frances Roberts has blessed the multitudes with this book. In a world of speed and noise, this volume is a quiet oasis for the weary soul. It deserves wide distribution and personal appropriation.\\" Based solely upon and filled with God's written Word, Come Away My Beloved provides a mix of comfort, conviction, and compassion; it is designed to draw the believer, in whatever stage of Christian growth he or she may be, into a more intimate fellowship with the Lord. <br /> <br />Underscoring the truth that God says to us all, \\"Only as you know Me can you come to be more like me,\\" this unique devotional book is a wonderful aid that can be used alongside the scriptures in a daily quiet time with the Lord. Truly, \\"The earthly obscures the heavenly,\\" but this book allows its reader a glimpse of eternity through the eyes of Christ, and opens the door to closer fellowship with the Father through the power of His Holy Spirit. Its insights are suitable for all believers. -- Nancy K. Brown, Christian Book Previews.com  <br />	2004-08-02

Blomberg provides thoroughly researched answers to these very compelling modern-day queries. The author's well-documented evidences lend valuable insights into the Christian faith and provide valid reasoning for the reliability of scriptural teachings. <br /> <br />Blomberg says, \\"Until we know what a passage meant in its original historical and literary context, and until we have a reliable translation that reflects accurate meanings of words and sentences in that passage, we cannot determine how to apply it to our quite different contexts in the twenty-first century.\\" His statement is altogether true, which is why it is imperative that Christians know what the Bible actually says and understand what it really means. God does not need us to defend Him; it is we who must study in order to be fully persuaded in our own minds about what we profess. Therefore, as responsible followers of Christ, we must look at the scriptures in light of human history to understand how beautifully and truthfully they are constructed.  <br /> <br />For instance, the book says, \\"The textual evidence for the New Testament from the first centuries after it was written is staggering. Scholars of almost every theological stripe agree that Christian scribes copied the New Testament with extraordinary care, matched only by the accuracy of Jewish scribes in copying the Hebrew Scriptures.\\" As Believers, we need to be aware of this truth so that we can be confident, not only in our personal profession, but in the accuracy of Christ and His teachings as told to us in the New Testament. <br /> <br />Blombery, who holds a Ph.D from the University of Aberdeen, draws upon years of study and research in authoring this book. He is aprofessor of New Testament at Denver Seminary, where he has been teaching for more than fifteen years. He has authored or edited more than ten books, including Jesus and the Gospels and Interpreting the Parables.  <br /> <br />Making Sense of the New Testament is suitable for all who are interested in Christian apologetics, and for those who wish to gain a better understanding of the historical and theological context from which the New Testament is written. -- Nancy K.

S. Lewis' creation of Narnia.  This scholarly work is written for adults, but the explanations don't remove the magic of the Chronicles of Narnia.    Beginning with a short biography of Lewis' life, Duriez continues with the books from various periods that influenced Narnia's unique attributes.  He points out the parallels between the Chronicles and Christianity, followed by concepts borrowed from other worldviews.  The chapter titled \\"Literary Features of the Chronicles\\" discusses genre, perception, and the books' sometimes visible but never intruding narrator.  The first section of the book ends by further expounding on the themes, concepts, and images found in Lewis' books.    Part Two is an encyclopedia for the Chronicles, giving a brief overview of each book, a history of Narnia (complete with a timeline), and a chapter on its geography.  Then Duriez shows Lewis' other writings in the context of Narnia, and the people who influenced Lewis' life and works.  Part Three, a dictionary, covers Narnia from Adam to Zardeenah.  Extensive notes, a chronology of Lewis, and a detailed bibliography end the book.    Though repetitive in places, A Field Guide to Narnia adds depth to the Chronicles without reducing them to theological tomes or classics merely to be analyzed.  Without a hint of overt suggestion, Duriez makes you long to read the Chronicles once more. -- Katie Hart, Christian Book Previews.com	2004-08-01

The book opens with Morley's life story which ropes the reader from the first paragraph. The author covers morals, dating situations, and other life impacting decisions.  <br /> <br /><br />As a 14 year guy, this book encouraged me to be a godly man and leader in this world. Morley used illustrations from his own life as examples of what to do or what not to do. He stated that men want to have a mission in life. If there is no mission, there is no life. God designed men to be protectors. A man cannot be a protector and a jerk at the same time.  <br /> <br /><br />Morley is a popular speaker in my area in the Midwest for men's retreats and his books are frequently used in men's Bible studies.&lt;i> The Young Man in the Mirror&lt;/i> could be a Bible study opportunity for older men to mentor the next generation.  <br /> <br /><br />&lt;I>The Young Man in the Mirror &lt;/I>instructs teenage boys how to live honorably.

Claire and Sophia are searching for answers independently, but Sophia's fears keep her in seclusion. They learn from Josephine's words as well as each other when God intersects their lives on a treacherous Pacific shoreline. <br />Marinusen's language is almost poetic in its beauty.

Though Dr. Ray does give some information about home schooling around the world, the book is largely about homeschooling in the United States and homeschooling in general.. This is not surprising because the United States has more experience, statistics, and personalities in the movement than other countries do. <br /> <br />As the president of the National Home Education Research Institute, editor of Home School Researcher, expert witness on homeschooling trials, and a homeschooling father of eight children, he writes authoritatively on the history of the movement, the benefits of homeschooling, the latest research on the adjustment of former home-schooled students to adult society, teenage's concerns, and general homeschool questions.  <br /> <br />This is not a how-to book through he does answer some questions about starting. Instead, he provides &quot; a quick and accurate overview of the homeschool movement and key topics related to it.&quot; (page ix) The book answers questions of potential homeschoolers, concerned grandparents, and the media.  <br /> Ray varies his format by chapter. Some chapters are in question-and-answer format while he uses straight narrative in others. He writes in a straightforward style with few anecdotes.  <br /> <br />Each chapter contains profiles of homeschoolers. Most are leaders in the movement, but some are less well-known students and parents. He includes an appendix of homeschooling organizations from around the world, copious endnotes, and an index. <br /> As a former homeschooler, I think this book would be helpful for anyone considering homeschooling or confronting skeptics. -- Debbie W.

Jesus used parables throughout his ministry and Terry Felber's book The Legend of The Monk and The Merchant shows that parables can still teach lessons today. In Legend, wealthy businessman Antonio shares the twelve principles of his success.    The story centers around the twelve principles and has example from Antonio's life to illustrate each. The principles stress the importance of perseverance and responsible handling of money.    As Antonio shares his life story with his grandson Julio the reader learns how Antonio went from being the foster son of a monk to one of the most influential merchants in Italy. Principle one \\"work hard and God will proper you\\" is illustrated by Antonio's invention of Venice's trade currency, which is the source of his fortune  My favorite part of the book was the surprise ending that tells what Antonio  did with his money.    Despite the good message the book has a few problems. The characters are very underdeveloped and the Renaissance Italy setting clashes with the modern concepts and speech.    I believe this book would be enjoyed most by those who view it as a pleasant  way to learn business principles, rather than by those who read for entertainment. Though it's not Pilgrim's Progress, The Legend of The Monk and The Merchant is worthy to stand with such great business parables as Who Moved My Cheese and The Go-getter. -- Amy Stoller, Christian Book Previews.com	2004-07-22

Her parents are divorced, her father remarried, her mother struggling with cancer, and Jana must deal with the pain of her own recent break-up as she spends Christmas with her mother and aunt.  On top of everything, her mother has returned to her childhood faith. <br />When a therapist at her aunt?s church suggests journaling events in the Biblical Mary?s life from her own perspective, Jana accepts the challenge.  As her questions about God and faith find answers from her fictionalized characters, the Christmas story becomes much more than a story. <br />Beautifully written, this novella brings a unique twist to the old saga of stable, shepherds, and stargazers.

A Raw-Truth Journal on Following Jesus is a youth thirty-day devotional that will change the life of any person who actively reads and journals their way through it. Mike Yaconelli was a pastor and youth worker with an obvious sense of the emotional, physical, and spiritual situations youth face. In this book he challenges youth to think and reflect on thirty traits exhibited by the New Testament disciples.  <br /> Some of the traits included are: boldness, daring, confusion, discouragement, doubt, alienation, fear, generosity, hatred, ordinary, overconfidence, sensitivity, shrewdness, strength, and weakness. Each devotional includes a paragraph or two defining the day's word, a scripture portion, a here-and-now story illustrating the word, a TOP 10 list request, and a journal section to complete.  <br /> &quot;Ordinary means average, usual, plain, common, and typical. In other words, nothing special...and nothing spectacular...Disciples are just ordinary people who follow an extraordinary Lord...When it comes to following Jesus, being ordinary is one of the main qualifications.&quot; <br /> This book is totally geared to youth. You find yourself turning the book every which direction to read the &quot;Fact for the Day,&quot; or to follow a quote from the bottom up the side. The illustrating is marvelous. Yet I was challenged as an adult as I read the different situations he presented. Challenged--but encouraged. An unbeatable combination for a great read.  <br /> This is my first book by Mike Yaconelli, but it won't be my last. He was an awesome writer who told it like it is and leaves you wanting more. ?

Celia, the successful music teacher in a private school, has decided that this will be her last year. As she directs her final Christmas concert and the boys' choir sings, &quot;Gesu Bambino&quot; in perfect pitch, Celia hears the faint cry of an infant. She attributes it to an emotional moment and waves it off, until she comes face to face with a newborn. <br /> Excitement and purpose return to Celia's life as she provides the baby and its destitute parents with food, warmth and shelter during the winter. The students of the town are enlisted to give a new future to this little family during its &quot;bleak midwinter.&quot; <br /> The author is a composer who not only tells a narrative of characters and events, but also gives subtle and meaningful insights about songs, cantatas, and various other musical selections. The writing style is light, fast-paced, and reader friendly, without heavy vocabulary or deep symbolism. Although set at Christmas, the themes of fellowship, love, outreach, and self-sacrifice are appropriate for year-round reading. This is entertainment with a message. <br /> The characters are likeable and well developed, and the author concludes her story with a hint of pending romance. This is an obvious opening to her forthcoming sequel, There's a Song in the Air. The target audience of readers for these books is women ages 18 ? 55, but the involvement of students in the plots make the stories appropriate for children, too. -- Daisy E.

Nuernberg presents independent, young Anne Askew, a noblewoman educated far beyond most ladies in sixteenth-century England.  When she receives Christ, she openly embraces Reformist doctrines, shocking her more conservative father and stepmother.  But Anne?s newfound faith comforts her when a peasant revolt threatens her father?s and brothers? lives. <br /> <br />After the clamor dies down, Anne begins to witness to family members, servants, and peasants in the surrounding countryside.  Her straightforward presentation of Scripture and excellent debate skills create tension within the Askew home, especially with her stepmother.  But Anne?s tenacity and an unforeseen tragedy will propel her life into danger. <br /> <br />While the historical detail in this novel is impressive, the prose is stilted and awkward throughout.  The enigmatic main character shows herself as both a pious saint and a liberated feminist, an unusual mix for the 1500s.  Omnipresent point of view distances readers from the story, and the somewhat flat characters fail to pull readers back in.  The plotline carries the required rising action, but events become merely history as Anne makes decisions that will determine her future.  Recommended to those interested in Reformation martyrs and who would like a story slightly less dry than history books. --Katie Hart, Christian Book Previews.com <br />	2004-07-22

Somehow dealing with family is more difficult than with someone else. I wish I had owned What to Do When You Don't Know What to Say to Your Own Family by Mary Ann Froehlich and PeggySue Wells. <br />Writing in the same style as in their earlier book, What To Do When You Don't Know What to Say, the authors include tips from spouses, parents and children, siblings, extended family, and church family who have helped one another through crises. Taken from the actual words of those who have experienced the help and the trauma of misguided actions in other cases, the book covers a number of situations from the struggles of growing up to the loss of a lifelong mate, financial hardships, or illness. <br />The authors divide the book into sections on children, teens, spouses, extended family, and church family. They break each section into subsections so it is easy to find material on various relationships. Chapters are broken down into vignettes told by people who found help through a family member's efforts. <br />This small book offers easy, comfortable reading with scads of practical ideas for helping family members through rough times. Some of the ideas came in handy when a family in my home church lost a child in an accident. I've recommended it to my sister whose best friend has cancer.

Comfort turns to love.<br /><br />The early part of the story concerns a couple who are together for the wrong reasons, and is enough of a subject to explore. Now that they are married, they must go forward, but are they outside the will of God? How do they heal from their grief when guilt is laced through the new relationship? How can a new husband fight the ghost of a perfect first love?<br /><br />Hatcher is delving into a darker subject, though. Deborah discovers that she's married to an alcoholic. Her new husband Gideon, a sweet, sensitive charmer, turns to drinking when life gets unpleasant. Eventually he begins to drink all the time.<br /><br />Through Deborah, we watch the phases of living with an alcoholic: the denial, the lies, the bitterness, the anger and blame. Hatcher doesn't let her characters off with easy answers, but she does offer hope in the end. As always, her writing is compelling and her characters have depth. She doesn't flinch from hard truths and she never forgets to entertain. &lt;i&gt;Beyond the Shadows&lt;/i&gt; is an excellent, intense study of alcoholism and the price people sometimes have to pay for love. - &lt;b&gt;Mary Connealy, Christian Book Previews.com&lt;/b&gt;	2004-07-20

For Hunt and White, this book represents the culmination of several years of repartee in print, on radio and in person.  White wrote The Potter's Freedom in 2000 as a reaction to a book by Norm Geisler, Chosen But Free.  Hunt's book, What Love Is This?  followed in 2002 as a response to The Potter's Freedom. Other authors have also weighed in on the subject in the past year, and of course, one doesn't need to look too far to find that this topic has generated volumes through the centuries.<br />The book is formatted in the style of an oral debate, with a chapter each of affirmation, response, defense and final remarks.  The points covered are basically those of the \\"five points\\" of Calvinism's TULIP: total depravity, unconditional election, limited atonement, irresistible grace, and perseverance of the saints.  Some readers may find this style a bit difficult to follow; I frequently had to flip back and forth between chapters to see for myself exactly which quote or point was being referenced, but this was not too troubling.<br />I found James White's material to be consistently thoughtful; his tone was generally gracious, but he dealt with the topics in an even, measured fashion, and his arguments were cohesive.  Dave Hunt's tone struck me as abrasive and sarcastic from the opening paragraph.  His tone was erratic; at times he was able to make his point clearly, with unemotional, sequential argumentation.  But this was not the norm.  In places it seems as though he is deliberately trying to miss the point, nowhere more so than in the discussion of assurance and eternal security in chapter fourteen.  I was also disturbed by his assertions that those who hold to Calvinist views of election are unconcerned for the lost.  He has only to read the works of the men he accuses - Piper, MacArthur,Pink, Sproul, Spurgeon and White -- to be ashamed of such a claim.<br />Because of the repeated charges of misquotation and misrepresentation (leveled by both authors), a careful reader would almost wish to have every reference source cited at hand.  I have read many of the books mentioned, and tried to go back to each quote for context, but gave up due to time constraints.  A complete bibliography and Scripture reference guide at the end of the book would be a huge bonus.  For anyone wanting to seriously consider the debate over Calvinism, this book will not be the final word, but an excellent starting place for further study. - Pam Glass, Christian Book Previews.com	2004-07-19
