Not only do you need to figure out whodunnit but who's dead.  Most of Carr's tales seem to deal with an impossible happening that is later plausibly explained.  This mystery falls into that category. In addition, the characters are wonderfully developed although somewhat dated (I can't imagine &quot;My wench&quot; would go over to well in addressing ladies), and, there is, of course, undercurrents of relationships among the characters that become important as the story progresses.  My only complaint is that there are not a whole lot of characters, and, as in one of the Carr books I read previously, one of the most undeveloped (or ignored characters) has too much to do with the finale.  Definitely a fun read.	2001-06-18

Of course, I am talking about the old black and white one hour episodes, which , even though before my time, I enjoy immensely in syndication.  This was the first Perry Mason I have read and I was amazed how well it stacked up to the show.  Or, I should say how well the show measures up to the book.  As I was reading the story I could visualize Perry Mason (a la Raymond Burr), and his cast of Paul Drake and Della Street as if I was watching the book as a movie.  There are plenty of nasty characters, convaluted motives, and a slick attorney in Perry Mason.  If you liked the show, the book follows the same pattern of developing the storyline.  Nasty person that no one likes, murder, many suspects, wrongfully charged heroine, and the savior Perry Mason.  Lot's of fun!	2001-06-15

An alien comes to earth advances the earth technology so that he can eventually bring what's left of his dying race to earth.  Of course, there is a time limit and the alien has to overcome his indoctrination into earth's culture as well as certain changes he goes through adapting to earth and its people.  All of us can probably relate to being an outsider at one point in our lives and, T.J. Newton, our alien friend, more than aptly makes us feel his uniqueness.  Oh, yeah, and a wildly unexpected ending makes this an unforgettable book.	2001-06-15

While I did not find the actual voyage into the alien that exciting, it was definitely suspenseful.  What was more interesting to me was the story that was happening outside the alien among the politicians, diplomats, and the poor doctors.  This was page-turning stuff!  I think that the problem with the voyage inside the body was that it plays better on the big screen where one can visualize the suspense among the myriad of special effects.  The narrative does just not do it justice.  Great characters, a mysterious alien, and a good tale make this a four star book.	2001-06-14

I do not make it a habit of reading books after seeing the movie, but I made an exception in this case.  I enjoyed the movie and I would recommend the book.  While it is short, it is perfect for a summer read at the beach.  The story is very similar to the movie so you may ask why read it?  Two reasons, the beginning and the end.  These are both vastly different from the movie and will definitely leave an impression on the reader.  The narrative really makes one question all the experimenting on animals we do, and I, too,  was made to feel the same discomfort that the narrator feels at various sightings on the Ape planet.	2001-06-14

There were a lot of characters and a lot of relations among the characters- I had a hard time keeping up with who was who!  My real problem with the book, however, was that much of the story was advanced through letters from one of the good guys.  The story had basically slowed to a stop and then all the footwork and plot advancement happened in these letters.  I just did not like that method for development.  After reading these letters our hero, the Professor, figures everything out and gets on an airplane to resolve the case.  Maybe if the letters had been developed as part of the plot and the 100 pages of filler before had been eliminated I could have got into the fun.  Oh well!	2001-06-14

It seems that many of the classic science fiction novels deal more with man's attitude toward his surroundings rather than the stories of aliens and the future world gone crazy thru technology.  This book takes the simple premise of a world where books are illegal and turns it into a Twilight Zone episode.  The best part of a novel such as this is that the reader is forced to contemplate a scenario which is actually imaginable and decide how he or she would act and react.  An interesting story to say the least.....	2001-06-14

As a matter of fact, there were a few episodes I could have gone without knowing (body mutilations), but otherwise, a very informative read.  Who would have thought that such a scholary work would have been influenced by such a strange individual as the &quot;madman&quot;?  What was also interesting about this book was the background regarding the making of the dictionary itself as well as its place in history.  I am not a real avid reader of history, but this was quite informative and held my attention.	2001-06-11

Books	4	9	9	N	N	A very fun and entertaining read...	and the only reason I do not give it five stars is that the ending should have been different (it was not who it should have been!!!).  The characters were well drawn, with the  protagonist, Merlini the Magician, the best of all.  The tale takes place at a roving circus and there are plenty of potential suspects and very interesting characters.  Most of them have motives and the plot moves very smoothly.  In addition, the author obviously knows plenty about the circus as the story is filled with inside lingo and terms which are explained in footnotes that actually add to the story.  A bit of humor (bumbling cops), and a few red herrings make this a page turner.  However, the ending, while certainly plausible - and backed up with notations relating to previous pages in the narrative - somewhat came from left field.  I would say more but it would ruin the end.  Anyway, great characters, a great setting, lots of fun, this is a good read for any mystery lover....	2001-06-11

Straight, to the point, in your face narrative by Phillip Marlowe makes these books hard to put down.  The Lady in the Lake has more &quot;gotchas&quot; then the normal Marlowe story, but the main thing is still not some wild whodunnit but rather a simple crime explained in a simple plausible way.  The fun is in letting Marlowe describe the action sort of like John Madden describing football without all the grunts.	2001-06-11

This book reminds me a lot of Snow Falling on Cedars.  While that story dealt with the prejudice of the Japanese and the paranoia of the time, this story has undertones of the Jewish prejudice and disdain for the &quot;stock jobbers&quot;.  Both stories are within a histoical context in which the author develops the time and mood using a mystery as a backdrop.  While I really enjoyed Snow, I never felt the attachment to the narrator, Benjamin Weaver, in A Conpiracy of paper.  I learned a lot, but I was more interested in the mysterious death of Weaver's father and felt that this part of the story lacked development and was there to just keep the narrative moving.  There were not enough characters introduced to make it difficult to gues the villian and I was not that impressed with the way the story wrapped itself.  The story went on about 100 pages too much for me also (my attention span runs about 300 plus).  Anyway, an engrossing story that lacked the big payoff I was expecting, the tale was still better than a lot of what I have read lately.	2001-06-11

Not only is the story a great mystery, but it is quite a history lesson as well.  Smooth character development, great interaction among the characters, and baffling mysteries simply explained make this one of the better series that I have read lately.  The protagonist Julian Kestrel is something out of a Dumas novel (and that's a good thing!) and the ending actually follows the plot.  I will read the other novels in the series too.	2001-06-11

Although it was a bit melodramatic sometimes - the love story was a bit too contrived and coincidental- the story reads like an old movie.  There are bits of mystery, some horror elements, and sort of a game between the reader and the author in which the author- through footnotes- dissuades the reader why the the obvious assumption is wrong - hence, the nine wrong answers.  This was a definite page turner as I was never sure where the story was going.  The characters are scary and the book has a forboding atmosphere, but this is an original!	2001-06-11

This is the first of Trent's cases that I have read and I am not sure how many there were previously, but this was an enjoyable read.  The characters are developed nicely, the plot flows along at a decent pace, and there are enough twists to keep me guessing.  Of course, the solution comes from left field, but was rather interesting based upon the characterization of the deceased.  A definite old time mystery without much gore and [sexual content], but interesting nevertheless!  Maybe I'll read some of his earlier cases.....	2001-06-06

I thought the summary blurb sounded intriguing, and as far as mystery set-ups go- a disappearing body and no trace of the murder venue- were quite good.  However, the protagonists were a bit stiff, and they were not that well developed.  The pay-off was a bit weak and sometimes it was hard to follow which characters were being discussed.

I was expecting something in the Douglas Adams Hitchhiker series, and was not entirely disappointed.  The book has its moments of irreverence, and some of the humor made me chuckle.

I was not disappointed!<br />Multiple suspects, great characters, a wonderful  atmosphere, and of course, revelations and many twists. <br />All of the  characters are wonderfully developed, so much that I could attach faces to  the descriptions.  The setting made me think of Dumas and the Three  Musketeers, and the relationship between the detective and his travelling  partner brought to mind Sherlock Holes and Dr. Watson.  The twists, turns,  and revelations actually seemed plausible and in case somewhat  foreshadowed.  However, the ending completely caught me off guard (which  was a good thing).  There are so many characters and so many possible  motives that the reader will be kept guessing.  <br />A long book, but very  involving and well written.  I am going to try another by the author.	2000-07-27

This is one of those instances in which I actually liked the movie better than the book.  However, that's not a bad thing because I thought the movie was pretty good.  As I read the book all I could think of was how perfectly  Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas were cast as the brothers.  Being that  I saw the movie first, it was difficult not to envision the actors moving  through the pages.<br />The book was a little bit more depressing, as the  movie doesn't follow the elder brother all the way through his descent.  I  especially enjoyed the culture, the characters, and sharing the dreams of  the main characters as well as the many interesting people the brothers  meet.  My only complaint, and it's a big one, was the plot is pretty thin.   Since the ending is foreshadowed early, the book moves in almost real time.   Feeling Ceasar's pain for three hundred pages is a little heavy, although  it haunted me long after I put the book down.  Maybe a few more years of  &quot;Mamboing&quot; and definitely, a better history of Maria.<br />It makes  me want to re-rent the movie.	2000-07-05

For the first 300 pages I was immersed in the suspenseful plot only to be left  hanging by the final 60 pages.  I never quite understood who the girl was  and how she tied into the story, and some of the characters actions were a  little extreme and hard to accept based on the how the Dumas manuscript  plot is resolved.  The other plot line, The Nine Doors, is never resolved  to my liking, and is horribly anti-climatic.<br />The author does a good job  developing his characters, and even the extraneous people the protagonist  meets added depth to the novel.  The backdrop of old and original books,  and the buyers and sellers who inhabit such was very interesting and gave  the book just the right atmosphere.<br />Consequently, the build-up, the cast  of characters, the wild tangents, and original plot make the book an  engrossing read.  Maybe, the author could find a collaborator, like Dumas  had in The Club Dumas, to close out his fascinating tales with equally  fascinating endings.  Then the book would rate five stars.	2000-07-01

The story is in the style of a Dickens novel, long on descriptions and characterizations.  The story is big on atmosphere and morals, and truly  sets up the reader in the proper period.  But, since history was not my  thing, or at least, wasn't when I purchased this book, I found myself bored  with some of the chapters and detours that the author takes in wrapping up  the tale.  The characters were well detailed, but I felt somewhat  predictable, and sometimes I felt the story veered on soap operaish  (probably not a word).<br />I thought that this was a science fiction novel,  but the science fiction component, or time travel,  is almost irrelevant to  the story.  However, if Dickens was your man and you want a touch of time  travel and semi-interesting theories regarding such, this is the book for  you.	2000-06-27

Throw in the game of chess and all of its possibilities both as an allegory and a device for solving the mystery and you have a very  entertaining set-up.  However, the payoff was not in line with the premise  and that's where I downgrade the book.  The ending was not consistent with  the characterization, and, to me, there was something icky (for lack of a  better word) about one of the key relationships.  While that did not take  away from the mystery, it did distract from the read.<br />I did like the  chess player, and thought he was a great character.  The book would have  been much better had he been the protagonist rather than Julia.  Still, the  plot in itself makes the story worth the read, and its originality eases  the let down of the ending.	2000-06-27

I first read the un-annotated version in college in one of those mandatory to graduate classes.  Needles to say, most (okay probably, all)of the allusions and word games went flying by me.  However, the professor (who  had the annotated version)opened my eyes to what I was missing.  This is  the only book I have ever read more than once.<br />While most people get hung  up on the &quot;perverted theme&quot;, this book is a magnificent literary  read- one of the few classics that hasn't bored me to death.  There are  word games, references to history and authors, subtle humor, a mystery that  the reader can actually solve if he or she pays attention to the clues,  and, ultimately, even a sad, tragic story.  Without the annotated version  who would have known?<br />I've seen both movies, and while Jeremy Irons isn't  bad, you have to read the book to get the full effect.	2000-06-06

A fascinating history of of Mars and Hershey with so many trivial facts that I find myself remembering various tidbits every time I tear open a bag of M&amp;M's or chow a Hershey bar.  As an avid candy eater, I was  surprised to discover chocolate and the access to chocolate was relatively  new - I figured candy bars had been around forever.  The author does a good  job of making the history entertaining from the process of manufacturing  chocolate, to the histories of the companies, to the characterizations of  the families involved.  I now understand why chocolate - which I thought  was generic- tastes so different in all parts of the world.   My only  complaint regarding the book was that some chapters seemed to be redundant  - information was rehashed that had been discussed earlier.  This made the  book a bit overly long.  However, as a guy who pretty much reads only  fiction, it was an entertaining history lesson.	2000-06-06
