Warshawski Novels)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	An intelligent,  fast paced novel	The mystery novels of Sara Paretsky never fail to deal with contemporary issues. Paretsky is unafraid to wear her heart and her philosophy on her sleeve. This guarantees a tale of intensity and suspense but can also lead to somewhat overdone villains. This is the case with this novel. The villains have no redeeming values and although her portrait of the lot of the less fortunate in the ghettos of South Chicago is undoubtedly accurate, the pure awfulness and selfishness of the bad guys is a little hard to swallow.  <br /> <br />Although when one considers recent business trials and the history of companies such as Enron, perhaps she is not too far off the mark. With that thought I revised my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  <br /> <br />V.I. Warshawski is called to coach a girl's basketball team in her old turf of South Chicago. The girls come from poor families and cope in various ways. The mother of one asks her to look at the possibility of sabotage in one particular flag making company and while watching it, the building and the owner are blown up. The grandson of the conglomerate, By Smart, disappears with one of her girls and Warshawski spends the rest of the book looking for him and fending off the many unattractive members of his family all the while looking to solve the murders that arise. <br /> <br />This is a tale that moves quickly, holds your breathless interest and will certainly not discourage me from reading her future novels. This is an author who can write, who is intelligent and sees clearly the inequities in an increasingly polarized society.	2005-08-09

His family comes alive in her books, particularly his wife, Paola. <br /> <br />This is perhaps her richest book. She gives the refugee problem a thorough look and although has no answers to the issue, gives you plenty of room to think about it. Leon never insults her readers with pat answers. <br /> <br />An African street vendor is killed...shot down while pushing his wares outside normal work hours. You know, of course, that he is an illegal migr and so does Brunetti. He struggles to solve the slaying against the wishes of his higher-ups who force him to work on the case surreptitiously. An interesting metaphor that parallels the plight of the illegal vendors. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-05-24

This book is quirky, sometimes funny but always sad and honest about the pains and tragedies of life. <br /> <br />Jackson Brodie, former police inspector and now a private investigator, has a handful of cases that involve disappearances. The book encompasses two aging sisters looking for the sister that disappeared over thirty years ago, a retired solicitor looking for answers to his daughter's murder, ten years before, and a sister of an ax-murdering husband killer looking for her niece. His clients turn to him for answers and explanations. <br /> <br />Brodie is only in his mid-forties but is depressed and unhappy and has led a life with few rewards. He is divorced and his ex-wife is threatening to take his beloved daughter to New Zealand. The final blow.  <br /> <br />He plods along and finds answers, if not explanations, for some of the mysteries. This book is more than a simple mystery and delves into the complexity and basic untidiness of life. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-05-09

This one, though, was a bit of a disappointment. Kaminsky is a prolific, accomplished writer but the story line in this book is not up to his usual standard.  <br /> <br />There are just too many coincidences in the book; a villain who tried to rob Abe's synagogue over thirty years before, is murdered when Abe is bringing him back from Arizona to face charges in Chicago. The plotting strains one's credibility.  <br /> <br />Hanrahan, his partner, is teamed up with a racist, sexist temporary partner, who just happens to have been married to a black woman. Who has since died.  Huh? <br /> <br />The incident that ends the book also leaves one somewhat dazed. <br /> <br />The charm of this book as in all Lieberman books is the humanity of Abe and the realistic and sympathetic portrayal of his family and friends.  <br /> <br />If you are new to Kaminsky, I would strongly suggest reading all of his earlier Lieberman mysteries. They are great! <br /> <br />All in all, this one is not up to his usual standard but even with that caveat, Kaminsky keeps you intrigued and once you suspend your logical brain, this is a good read.	2005-05-09

But this latest adventure is tired, trite and recycled. As someone in another review said; the conversations between Hawk and Spenser and between Susan and Spenser have become tiring and repetitive. What was fresh and amusing and thoughtful has become worn and old.  <br />Ukrainians owning and controlling a town of 80,000 people. An Afghan warlord supplying heroin. FBI and CIA contributing to the mixture. Cold blooded, callous murder and too many references to friendship.  <br />The story line is convoluted and the denouement quite unbelievable. <br />What I wouldn't give to see a book that had the excitement, perception and intelligence of his early works!!	2005-04-28

As other reviewers have mentioned, Scudder evolves and matures in each adventure.  <br /> <br />In this one, he deals with a serial killer who alternates between killing boys and setting up a completely innocent person to take the fall-and die-for his crimes and attacking and killing women. Scudder, working on a case for a woman who wants to find out the background of her elusive boyfriend is unaware for a large part of the book that the killer is really after him and Elaine. The plot careens to an explosive and violent end. <br /> <br />This Scudder adventure was sadly lacking. For one thing, I am very tired of the serial killer who is so brilliant that he defies most attempts to trace or even to know there is a serial killer. In reality I would hazard to guess that most of these people are not of that type; they manage to evade capture for many reasons and rarely because they are brilliant. This premise has, I think, been done to death. Also, the interspersion of the killer's thoughts was unsettling to the flow of the story. And lastly, the violence was off-putting. <br /> <br />That said Block, even in a less than satisfying book, is a master and though disappointed quite early in the book, I couldn't put it down. His is a masterful writer and I do hope his next Scudder adventure is a better read.	2005-04-03

Wilson's protagonist, Benjamin Justice, is in the process of writing his memoirs and while delving into his past and searching for information about the priest who sexually abused him as a child, he starts upon a series of catastrophes and mayhem. <br /> <br />First, his best friend's fianc is assassinated; though in the beginning his death is considered an accident. There is a hired assassin and skullduggery and corruption in the highest echelons of the Catholic Church. The story proceeds pell-mell to a quite unbelievable conclusion. <br /> <br />As always, Wilson imbues Justice with depth and humanity and compassion and his friends and neighbors are delightful and entertaining. But unfortunately, this foray by Justice is just a little too much over the top. Hopefully, his next adventure will return to some semblance of reality	2005-03-29

And it is good.  <br /> <br />Terri Jackman, the wife of superstar basketball player \\"T-Jack\\" Jackman has been murdered and Mars and his team know Jackman is responsible for her death. Unfortunately, he has an air tight alibi, being with Terri's parents ironing out a $100 million dollar settlement: the price for his agreement to their divorce. Jackman is almost too despicable a villain and the frustration Mars and his team feel when they realize that he is going to get away with her murder is palpable. <br /> <br />As in the previous books of this series, Mars relationship with his young son, Chris, is delightful although in this one there is a looming separation between them with Denise, his ex-wife, planning to move to another state and take Chris with her. She is also intending to marry her live-in, Carl, who is far from an ideal candidate for good stepfather. This anxiety adds to Mars stress as he is taken off the Jackman case. <br /> <br />Ultimately, he solves the case with a stunning conclusion. Fast-paced and suspenseful, the story draws one along like a speeding train with surprising twists and revelations as it nears the conclusion. It was hard to put the book down as it wound towards the end. <br />	2005-03-06

Elder is sad, sad and has moved to the Cornish coast and is attempting to retire from life. A cheating wife, a distant relationship with his teenage daughter are what he left behind but he is also haunted by a teenage girl who disappeared over fifteen years earlier. Two young men who were responsible for the rape and murder of another teenager at the time of her disappearance are the likely suspects but the missing teenager's body is never found. The action starts when one of the culprits is released from jail. And Elder meets the teenager's mother and starts his search for the truth. <br /> <br />Harvey's writing is superb, as usual, but the story somehow lacks the depth and life of the Resnick series. Perhaps it is that the denouement is quite contrived and ultimately disappointing. Or perhaps it is the pervasive gloom and sadness permeating the story.  <br /> <br />Hopefully, this is a series that will improve. Still much better than many a mystery out there; Harvey is a talented writer. <br />	2005-02-26

An interesting twist is that the character, Stoney Jackson has almost no memory because of being hit by lightening. Only an author of the caliber of Tapply could bring of this rather bizarre, interesting premise. His memory has not completely disappeared and there are many hints of his previous occupation that will provide more plots in the future, I expect. <br /> <br />Stoney has built himself a house in the woods, is finding happiness in his involvement with his boss, Kate, another interesting character. Kate is married to a man with MS and brings greater depth to the story. Tapply capitalizes on his love and knowledge of fishing, the outdoors, animals and Maine to bring a real sense of place to the story. Life is getting better for him when a fellow worker and friend is murdered and Stoney suspects that he was the intended victim. <br /> <br />The plotting and pace carries this book along and it is a page turner. One small caveat is that the final solution/reason for the murder seems a bit forced but one does not feel this until the book is completed. A good read and recommended. <br />	2005-02-26

Too bad this one had only the writing. <br /> <br />I won't go into the plot as other reviewers have done so in detail.

He starts, of course, with Freud and with psychoanalysis in particular.  (Actually, although the jacket description cites \\"blame the victim\\", it should include \\"blame the mother\\".)  <br /> <br />In that period it was decided that in many cases, Autism, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive could be explained by the faults and failing of the mother. That there was no physical reasons for these maladies; they were all the result of at best, faulty thinking by the victim and at worst, bad parenting, mainly by mothers.  <br /> <br />Dolnick uses the actual words of the various therapists as well as their patients. Starting with Freud and his overweening emphasis and preoccupation with sex, he ranges from Frieda Fromm-Reichmann to Bruno Bettelheim (and his refrigerator mothers) with the many therapists in between.  Although he starts with Freud, the real shame lies with the therapists that followed him and elaborated on his theories. They all delivered the scathing, harsh message to mothers and parents that they had driven their children mad. And sadly, that message was not challenged for more than a generation.  <br /> <br />A compelling reminder to be skeptical about theories about mental issues and about absolute theories, in particular. A well-written, well-researched book. <br />	2005-02-20

This from an author who has written such enjoyable, gripping books and given me many hours of pleasure; for example Plum Island and The Lion's Game. If not for that history, I would never have finished the book; I kept hoping he was going to display some of his old skills.  <br /> <br />Half way through the book one gets the picture that there will be no clear ending. But this book was just so silly. Well, yes, there was a rocket that downed TWA Flight 800 but we are not going to tell you why it happened or who exactly did it or give a reason for the cover up or tell you planned it. But, trust us, there is strong, compelling, sure evidence that there was a rocket and yes, there is a conspiracy but conveniently, the September 11th attacks will stop the explanations. <br /> <br />This author has written some interesting books but this one has really turned me of him. I read the entire book because I kept hoping it would improve. The dialogue in some places was great but the characterizations were, I thought, quite weak. For example, I didn't get any kind of feeling for Kate; she was a bit of a cipher. Bottom line, I felt cheated by the book. A gripping beginning with an interesting premise that ultimately withers away to an overly convenient cop-out ending. <br /> <br />	2005-02-16

In those days, lobotomies were popular and quite in fashion and were believed to cure epilepsy. Henry suffered from severe epileptic fits and he was brought to a doctor for a cure.  So...Henry's doctor, one William Beecher Scoville, drills two holes into Henry's head and draws out his hippocampus through a silver straw. (The straw was an interesting, macabre touch)  And after this operation, Henry can read and write and talk but his memory is gone. He can never again live on his own; he gets lost wherever he goes. He has vague memories from before 1953 but they are tattered. And from the date of the operation, his memory spans about 30 seconds.  <br /> <br />This book is a well-written, thoughtful examination of not only Henry's loss and subsequent life but also about the nature of memory. Memory, indeed, makes us human. Our lives are a story told by memory, changed, elaborated upon and constantly revised. \\"Memory is not solid, it is liquid,\\" says the author and around this premise and Henry's misfortune and life, he builds a compelling tale.  <br />	2005-02-13

You are left feeling breathless at the arbitrariness of life, of fate and of chance. In other words, about life. It is so difficult to categorize her writing.

An frank and sometimes amusing look at modern woman and her efforts to cope with work, relationships and motherhood. These women write with extreme honesty and no bitterness.  <br /> <br />The world has changed dramatically from the Victorian \\"Angel in the House\\" that Virginia Woolf railed against.  And the fifties version of the same epitomized by June Cleaver.  But all is not nirvana in the new world and the 24 essayist in this book address these issues in thought-provoking prose.  All are involved in some form of endeavor in the written world and all can express themselves extremely well in that medium. <br /> <br />No matter the age or the stage the reader is, these essays resonate. My child rearing days are past but the book brought so many of the issues of those years tumbling back into my memory.  Even in these days of so-called equality, it is difficult to manage the demands of  career, relationships and children. The women in this book have the advantage for the most part to be able to afford some form of support and/or help. It is daunting to consider how it is for the less educated, well-paid mother who must work for a living (often at low wages) and still face the same challenges.  <br /> <br />Witty and thought provoking.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-03

In the deluge of \\"let's just be happy\\" rather superficial books, this one is a refreshing departure from that norm. <br /> <br />Written by a leader in his field, Dr. Anderson does not negate the biological determinants affecting longevity.  But drawing on his work as the CEO of the American Psychological Association as well as numerous studies, he paints a compelling picture of the actual links between emotions, beliefs and one's social environment and their effect on one's health and subsequent death. He also cites the many studies that show how these same factors influence our vulnerability to everything from the common cold to heart disease. The book is written in an understandable style and features vignettes of prominent people, such as Maya Angelou, Terry Fox and Linda Ellerbee to add a more personal touch to his scientific presentations and findings. <br /> <br />This is a book that will give you a most compelling reason to try and change your life and your way of living. It can indeed be a matter of life or death or at the very least a significant factor in the quality of your life. <br />	2005-02-01

My sense is that the main story could not be fleshed out enough to make a decent sized novel.  <br />The meat of the book is concerned with the threat of a blackmailer who is threatening to poison an unspecified product unless the town of Castlemere pays a ransom of one million dollars. His opening moves are caustic soda in baby powder and cholera in cough medicine. Neither do any fatal harm but the threat appears to be that if the ransom is not paid, the moves will become deadly. Interesting but as I said above, the story on its own would probably be more suitable as a novella. <br />Still an interesting read. Bannister is an excellent writer who breathes life into her characters and the town of Castlemere. All in all, as another reviewer stated, this is a superior series. I would concur with that assessment.   <br />	2005-01-30

The good news is that the character of Joe Pickett continues to grow but the bad news is that the plot and ending of the book are quite unbelievable. The first half of the book is relatively gripping with the discovery of mutilated animals and then suddenly, the discovery of the mutilated bodies of two local men. <br />The second part of the books veers into Stephen King territory and it is a rare author who can emulate King convincingly. I found that even with that understanding the ending was way off in \\"woo woo\\" land as Pickett describes it.  <br />All in all, a disappointment from a writer who has delivered very engrossing books in the past.

Ann Rule has written another volume of her true case files; this is volume 9 and like the preceding volumes, there is a main novelette type story and a number of smaller stories. As always, she writes in a low key style with an obvious sympathy and compassion for the victims. In this volume, her unifying theme is how would-be lovers become predators and murderers. In almost every case, the murderer is unsympathetic if not an actual psychopath. And in almost every case, the victim is a trusting, naive lamb. The bulk of the stories occur during the 60's and 70's and in many cases, take many years for the perpetrator to be apprehended. Most occur in the Northwest areas of Washington and Oregon. <br /> <br />As the reviewer mentions, this story have a particular resonance with the current news stories regarding Scott Peterson and the death of Laci Peterson. The handsome, personable persona over an evil soul continues to fascinate and bewilder us. <br /> <br />Although this book is an engrossing read, I much prefer her full length books where she has the time and space to really delve into a story. In fairness, though, these vignettes do not have the depth to be expanded. <br />	2005-01-25

It was written in the 60's and preceded by \\"Call For the Dead.\\" Both books feature George Smiley but are not of the spy venue, but are more classic mysteries. His unfortunate marriage is referred to and there is a hint of the work he had done and is perhaps still doing in the spy field. But we must wait for future works to get a true taste of Smiley. <br /> <br />A murder in the prestigious private school, Carne, propels Smiley into a search for the murderer. There are many twists and turns and a dramatic denouement at the end. The story in all is quite dated but one must remember that it was written in the 60's.  <br /> <br />As a fan of the later le Carre, I found the book interesting and really quite a neat mystery story but when you compare with his later work, it is quite innocuous. I am indeed grateful that he swerved to go into the espionage field and give us so many truly fascinating books. <br />	2005-01-25

From Tourette's syndrome sufferers to those who have lost great chunks of their memory and past, he is unfailingly optimistic and, yes, kind. He almost forces one to abandon harsh judgments about the quality of life of these people and to look at and think about the pleasures and contributions they make. <br /> <br />I think the most touching chapter is when he delineates the lives and problems of those with what is loosely termed limited or drastically small mental abilities. He makes you stop and wonder if, indeed, their lives are not only valuable but also pleasurable and worthwhile. <br /> <br />A very thought provoking book.   <br />	2005-01-24

Once a young adult and working to become a successful performer the book loose some of its force.  <br /> <br />He seems to spend an inordinate amount of time in pursuit of and in enjoyment of \\"wine, women and song\\" and the telling, although lighthearted and witty, becomes more sluggish.  <br /> <br />The descriptions of the Avenger years is short and could have benefited by a little more length.  <br /> <br />All in all, a testament to the resiliency of the human animal, that Macnee finally matures into a responsible, caring individual (it does take him a while, though) in spite of a very weird and slipshod childhood.  <br />	2005-01-24

His series has been so strong and my fervent wish is that his next entry returns to his strengths. <br /> <br />This book suffers mostly from the lack of his two strong characters. Both Leaphorn and Chee are somewhat in the story line but their participation is lackluster and particularly for Leaphorn, very peripheral. The plot is hard to believe and the story is carried along by the actors in that same unrealistic plot. He brings some of his old magic to the description of the landscape of the Southwest but ultimately, the book is a disappointment. <br /> <br />I'll wait and hope for the next Hillerman and the return of his magic touch! <br />	2005-01-19

This entry is indeed his best; multi-layered, suspenseful and realistic. <br /> <br />Gunther is investigating a cold case, well over thirty years old, and is thrown back into the emotional crisis that was in his life at that time. His wife, Ellen, was dying, slowly and painfully of cancer at the same time he was investigating the brutal murder of a shopkeeper. A young man under suspicion at the time disappears and it seems that he is the murderer. The suspect is never found and suddenly the case is open again and Gunther must travel the path again, reliving the anguish of his young wife's death. In the present he must deal with his relationship with Gail, his lover, who is entering politics and in the midst of an active campaign. Her campaign means that he is not able to turn to her for support with his many conflicting emotions. <br /> <br />This is a well-written, suspenseful story made strong by the depth of the characterizations. A great series.   <br />	2005-01-19

He moves to a cottage on his brother's property near Ben's widow, Kate Frobisher, a sculptor and begins his book. He soon finds himself involved with Justine, a woman twenty years his junior and so the plot evolves.  <br /> <br />Barker is particularly adept in subtly delineating the effects of violence on the lives of her characters and this book is no exception.

His approach is to spur one's thinking as one peruses the actions of the press, governments, science and popular and current beliefs. He applies philosophy to the meaning of values and judgments and ultimately to the meaning of life. His approach is quite low key and dare one say \\"sensible\\"? <br /> <br />This is the type of book to keep on one's library shelf and dip into when the headlines and actions of the world make your head spin. I found it calming and fascinating. So much of current events seem to be dictated by a hardening, inflexible mindset, whether right or left, that it is refreshing to read an objective guide.   <br />	2005-01-08

Actually, it was a review by Katha Pollitt, a writer I admire immensely that precipitated my reading of the book... my thanks be to her for that. <br /> <br />There is so much written about this book on this site that it often obscures the true value of the book. Most of the negative reviews are prickly and leave one wondering if the reviewer has read the book. Much of the focus of the anti reviews seem to be self defensive at best and often anti-feminist and oftentimes an excuse to mount their particular hobby horse of women being the reason for all bad things.  <br /> <br />This is a valuable, even-handed book. Faludi delineates the quandary of the modern man with sensitivity and insight, just as many first generation feminist writers did the same for women. I won't go into the meat of the book as so many of the other reviewers, both pro and con, have done this. It is perhaps overlong but the message is so important this is a trivial caveat. <br /> <br />An important book and highly recommended. <br />	2005-01-06

Having read a few of Maitland's book, I finally made it to this one. The first two I read were good reads but nothing compared to Silvermeadow. This is a riveting read that uses a large mall, Silvermeadow, as the locus of the action. Brock and his crew, including DS Kathy Kolla use the search for a 14 year old employee at the mall as a pretext to hunt for Brock's nemesis, North. North has been spotted in the mall. The 14 year-old is discovered, murdered in a pile of garbage that has been compacted at the premises of the mall. The story takes off from there at breakneck speed with red herrings, twists and a hair rising ending. <br /> <br />The mall comes to life vividly as do the various characters in the novel. An excellent procedural mystery and I highly recommend it.  I look forward to reading more from this author. <br />	2004-12-29

The cause of feminist equality has improved somewhat in the intervening years but is still falls shamefully short of full emancipation.<br /><br />As Woolf so eloquently puts it, a woman needs money and a room of one's own.  And it is still a rare woman who has both. Her use of the imaginary tale of Shakespeare's sister and her \\"feminine\\" fate still has weight and packs a significant punch of truth.<br /><br />The other significant factor that Woolf does not touch on in this essay is time. The weight of child rearing, housework and domesticity still falls heavily on women. There has been some movement with men being involved in that area but the movement is very, very slow. Added to that, it is a rare woman who does not have to work and bring income into the household.<br /><br />Woolf continues to speak with honesty to the issues of feminism and women over the intervening bridge of years. This book still resonates. Highly recommended.	2004-12-27

I have had this book for years and just never got around to reading it. Why, I do not know. I am very glad I finally read it! <br /> <br />Edith Hope is a quiet, late 30ish writer of romance novels who is spending some time at the Hotel Du Lac in Switzerland. She has been \\"banished\\" there after backing out of her wedding at the time of the ceremony and causing so much embarrassment to her friends, not to mention the expectant groom.  <br /> <br />While at the hotel, she meets a number of women and the descriptions of their lives adds to the aimlessness and seeming futility of her existence. She writes to her secret lover, David, describing them and the life at the hotel and speaks of her love and passion for him. He, needless to say, is married and their relationship is sporadic and quite one-sided. Then, seemingly, rescue comes when a wealthy, successful man staying at the hotel, Philip Neville, proposes to her and offers her a very businesslike, loveless marriage.  <br /> <br />Through these avenues, Edith comes to some profound understanding about not only her life but the lives and needs of women. <br /> <br />There are so many undercurrents in this story and the writing is marvelous, wry, witty and multi-layered.  <br />	2004-12-27

Her essay on Palestine's children is one such example.  The title of her book refers to the attacks on September 11th, and she ranges over subjects such as poverty, racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, rape and far too many of the horrors of the world. Articulate and passionate, Jordan brings a keen creative mind to her subjects and strangely enough, considering her subjects, a feeling of optimism. <br /> <br />Reading Jordan does give one some hope for the future and the fervent wish for more of her ilk. An original, creative mind, she is sorely missed. <br />	2004-12-04

Dexter is a serial killer who because of the intervention of his policeman adoptive father has become different than your typical serial killer. The father challenged his killing instincts and directed those same instincts into somewhat more \\"noble\\" paths. Thus, Dexter only kills those serial killers who have done evil.

This novel is a welcome exception. <br /> <br />Winspear writes with a talent for bringing her characters and in particular, Maisie Dobbs to life. She also invokes the reality, the pain and the savagery of the First World War. It was indeed a savage, wrenching experience for those that lived through it and it never hurts to be reminded of the dreadful results of war. The recognition of the awful wounds resulting from it is a bitter reminder of the price paid by so many soldiers that were \\"lucky\\" enough to survive the war.  <br /> <br />Maisie is bright, ambitious and almost too good. There is just a tad too much of the angel brushed over her. But this remains a good read. The ending is easily predicted by the expert mystery fan but, that being said, this is an engrossing, entertaining read. <br /> <br />I found the writing around the war particularly compelling so I am curious to see her next book and whether she is able to sustain the same interest without the historical addition of the war <br />	2004-11-29

She marshals arguments and data to show that love, the Holy Grail that so many long for, is not only elusive but also often not the panacea that is promised by society. The love she is referring to is the romantic love we in the Western World base our marriages and relationships on.  She does not touch the subject of other loves; love of children, friends and/or family. <br /> <br />I found the first half of the book somewhat difficult but the last half redeemed the entire book. She puts a microscope on the society that holds love and its' rewards as the goal we should all strive for.  Yet that same society puts so many obstacles in the path of sustaining it.  Her thesis is that love is difficult to live with and even more difficult to sustain. She exposes the conformity and fear of being \\"different\\" that society demands from it citizens. The ideals; that love should last a lifetime; that love should be a constant and non-deviating emotion in a marriage; that when in love, one never looks at another woman or man. All rather difficult. Equating \\"working at love\\" with the current climate of burgeoning work hours and efforts demanded at even the most mundane of jobs strikes a chord. <br /> <br />Interesting and provocative reading that should spark further thinking and conversation.  <br />	2004-11-29

The author, using himself as the guinea pig, has ventured into the various avenues of research and knowledge about the brain and its workings. This is a wonderful book for the layman, interested in understanding the brain.  <br /> <br />From his explorations into the most primitive parts of the brain to the higher areas of creativity and thought, Johnson brings clarity to the functioning of this most fascinating organ. He examines the component parts of the brain; some parts which dictate the core survival tasks, such as heartbeat regulation and the flight-or-fight instinct and other parts, such as face recognition and interpretation.  Your personality, science and research is discovering, is the aggregate of the differing strengths of each of these modules, depending how they have been shaped by nature and nurture, by your genes and by your life experiences. You and your personality are indeed, the sum of the various parts of your brain. <br /> <br />Refreshingly free of dogma, the book is a romp through the working of this most marvelous organ. He examines and talks to Freudian theory, male-female differences, right brain-left brain and most interestingly, drugs and their influence on the brain.  <br /> <br />Turns out many of the drugs that influence our brains are manufactured by our bodies. This interesting information gives a bit of humor and wonderment to the \\"Just say no\\" and \\"This is your brain on drugs\\" campaigns by the moralists of all persuasions. <br /> <br />This book should stimulate a diverse examination of our behaviour and the theories and methods around modifying those behaviours.  <br />	2004-11-15

She never fails to deliver a wonderful read. Her picture of Venice and its society and politics is piercingly honest and although she shows all that society's warts and corruption, there is a sense of objectivity and compassion in her telling and in her police commissario, Guido Brunetti.  Brunetti is a full, well-realized character and his family gives him even more depth. Contrary to many mysteries, where all the loose ends are tied up and justice is served. Her stories often end with ambiguity and not necessarily with the bad guys getting their just rewards. <br /> <br />As an aside, his relationship and dealings with his superior, Patta, is worth the price of admission and give an even stronger, quite humorous picture of his control and tolerance. <br /> <br />Acqua Alta, the title, refers to the seasonal torrential rains of Venice and provides a backdrop to a tale of art, thefts and violence.  <br />	2004-11-12

Although Chief Inspector Brock appears to have divined the answer but having being taken off the case, may have orchestrated events (perhaps including the solution) behind the scenes.   <br />I find it interesting that the duo are referred to as \\"Kathy and Brock\\", her first name and his last.

For one thing, his descriptions of the Minnesota winters are so real and evocative that one is almost freezing reading them; and happy not to be suffering through the cold. His characters are well developed and believable in most of his books. <br /> <br />Solemn Winter Moon is a young Ojibwe Indian who has been in trouble with the authorities in the past. The victim, a beautiful high school student, Charlotte Kane, and he had been an item and then she broke up with him in a contentious manner. So when Charlotte's death is deemed a murder, Moon is the immediate suspect. Krueger explores the prejudices against the Indians in a realistic manner. The sheriff and the townspeople don't even consider any other suspects. Solemn runs away from certain conviction and while away, has a vision of talking to Jesus Christ. The story of Solemn's vision is handled in a sympathetic manner with interesting repercussions.  <br /> <br />The final solution to the murder and the unmasking of the murder is rather convoluted and seems to me to strain credibility a bit but all in all, this is a satisfying read. <br />	2004-11-07

It is somewhat dated, having been written in 1959, but holds up well with excellent plotting and a fast paced flow. The premise is fascinating and the writing moves quickly. I reread this mystery just recently and it stands up well in spite of being written 45 years ago. <br /> <br /> Philip MacDonald was a prolific writer; born in 1901. He won Edgar Allan Poe Mystery Awards in 1953 and 1956. He wrote a number of classic mystery stories, including this one, The Rasp and Warrant for X.  Warrant for X was made into the movie \\"23 Paces to Baker Street\\" starring Van Johnson, while \\"The List of Adrian Messenger\\" was made into a movie under the original name. It starred a plethora of stars in cameo roles with George C. Scott playing Anthony Gethryn. Both movies were not as good as the books but quite enjoyable.  <br /> <br />The List of Adrian Messenger's plot line concerns a list that Adrian Messenger gives to a friend in Scotland Yard and asks him, the friend, to check if each individual is still living at the same place. Messenger dies in an apparent plane sabotage and the search is on for the rest of the men on the list. The plot develops apace as many on the list of men seem to have suffered fatal accidents and on the surface, there appears to be no apparent connection between them. A recurring character of MacDonald's, Anthony Gethryn, is the protagonist.  <br /> <br />To reveal more would give away the plot. Read and enjoy!  <br />	2004-11-02

Dora, in this telling, is the murder victim, found in Volksgarten Park near the Imperial Palace.  The story details the meticulous work of the police inspector leading the investigation but the leading character is his wife, Erszebet. She takes every opportunity to read his case notes and to investigate on her own, with the help of an English governess, Wally. The story is lush with the heady atmosphere of early Vienna, rich Hungarian food, fortune telling, the coming war and layered over it the bible of detective work of that era, the police manual, System der Krimlalistik by Hans Gross. The manual is interestingly modern and surprisingly aware of the psychological aspects of crime. The methodology and forensics of detective work are still very much in their infancy, though. Particularly the photography of the era was not only primitive but also dangerous. <br /> <br />  The story is atmospheric and almost dreamy, on occasion but also never fails to hint and sometime skirts around sexual perversions and diseases. It is interesting how the author sometimes subtly and often overtly, highlights the prejudices against women and minorities of that period. It could be argued that we have not progressed much farther in that regard in the ensuing 94 years. <br /> <br />I read this book because I am very much a mystery fan and expected that the book would fall into that category. The novel fails on some levels to be a satisfying mystery novel but suceeds extremely well as an evocative picture of another era. <br /> <br />	2004-10-31

I understand that the author was also re-educated during seventies. <br /> <br />The only drawback to my complete enjoyment of this book was that for some reason I could not really identify with either boy, particularly Luo.  Normally with a book of this length and this well-written, I would read it in one sitting. I found that I could lay it aside and get into another book, then come back to it.  This is a minor caveat, though.  Their story is very real and their art of story-telling and their enjoyment of the novels are palpable.  The ending is delightful and surprising. <br />	2004-10-29

The plotting is not only rather weak but somewhat implausible. It smacks of a typical rote-romantic mystery which is quite unlike Crombie's usual novels.<br /><br />Gemma travels with her friend, Hazel Cavendish, to Scotland and whiskey distilling country and she finds out on their arrival, that Hazel had set up the weekend to reunite with her first lover. Although, married to a fellow therapist and seemingly happy in previous novels, it seems that Hazel has never gotten over her first lover, Donald Brodie, the owner of a successful distillery with a long history in Scotland. When Donald is murdered, Hazel is initially suspected. Kincaid makes a brief appearance but Gemma ultimately solves the murder. The murderer seems to have a somewhat weak motive for the crime but then the entire narrative plot is also weak.<br /><br />An ongoing historical narrative seems to be added to give meat to the plot but is a little fanciful and melodramatic, particularly when it is hinted that Hazel is plugging into this 100 year old story.<br /><br />All in all, a disappointment from a usually excellent writer. I look forward to her next offering.	2004-10-29
