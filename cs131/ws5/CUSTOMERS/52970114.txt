It was very hard to get into the book and want to continue to the end because the story just wasn't interesting. The reader doesn't get a sense of who the victim was, so it's hard to feel sympathy for the person. The murder part of the story really took a backseat to all the distracting social functions that Theodosia, the heroine, had to attend. The supporting characters, normally fun and three dimensional, were boring, whining, and morose throughout the book. Theo's relationship with her boyfriend, Jory, still doesn't progress. They are more like brother and sister. The magic of the earlier books simply isn't here.	2003-08-28

I had to force my way to finish it since the plot was so uninteresting. I didn't care about finding the murderer because there was no sympathy developed for the victim. The major characters in the series, normally fun, were annoying. Drayton moped throughout the book, Haley whined and complained, and Theodosia was too busy running around going to fashion events and hosting teas that solving the murder took a back seat. Even she was apathetic! As for Theo and her boyfriend, this is not exactly the romance of the century. They are more like brother and sister. I doubt that most women would consider being called &quot;kiddo&quot; by their boyfriends a term of endearment. By the time the murder was solved, it was anticlimactic, and I was just glad that the book came to an end. This book did not have the cozy charm that the others in the series did. Those who like this series can skip this entry and hope that the next book gets back on track.	2003-08-25

The characters and plot were fascinating and different. It was fun reading about this family's adventures as they traveled across the country. Then right when it got to the point where they were about to finally reach California, the author shifted gears and jumped ahead 30 years into the future. There was no explicable reason for this, and it really hurt the flow and point of the book. By that point, the reader couldn't relate to or even care about the characters anymore. This was an extremely disappointing and confusing ending to an otherwise good story.	2002-02-25
US	52970114	R2KN50SZVJPPXR	0425181901	987439916	Bloodroot (China Bayles Mystery)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	A solid addition to an excellent series	Sometimes people panic when an author departs from the setting of an established series. In some cases it does affect the series negatively. This is NOT the case, however, in the latest China Bayles mystery. China is a strong enough character to hold her own when the secondary characters are not present. I found this book to be fascinating. The subplots were interesting and the characters were well-defined and credible. The author presented a family tree at the beginning, so it was not confusing keeping the family members straight. It was good for China to get away from Pecan Springs and interact with her mother more. This book could be read and enjoyed by those who have never read any others in the series. It's an excellent story.	2002-02-25

The premise was good, but the mystery seemed to take a back seat to Anna's thoughts in this book. She seemed to be whining/complaining/ feeling sorry for herself on almost every page. There were some action scenes, but they just seemed to be put there just to have some action. The subplots were covered more than the main murder story. As always, the writing was excellent and the descriptive passages very realistic. This is a book for diehard Pigeon fans; if you've never read any in the series, don't start with this one. There are others better in the series.	2002-02-25

The Alpine series is a well-developed series of books with three-dimensional characters, vivid descriptions, humor, and excellent plot-lines. I always look forward to each new entry as I did this one. This book did not disappoint with regard to the above-mentioned characteristics. The citizens of Alpine are so realistic, I feel as if I know them, especially Emma and Vida. This book was a page-turner from beginning to end. So what's my problem? The ending. Without giving anything away, I felt that what happened was not true to the tone of the series or fair to Emma. Usually this series is more upbeat, a very attractive feature. However, the ending in this book was downright depressing, and I don't understand why it happened. If you're a die-hard Alpine fan, you may feel as I do about this part, but still enjoy the book. I do recommend it.	2001-10-26

A real page-turner	In this fourth outing for Leigh Koslow, the author has really hit her stride. The story held my interest from page one and kept me involved to the last page. The characters are likable, realistic, and well-developed. The plot is interesting, engaging, and keeps the reader turning page after page to follow the events as they unfold. Leigh and her cousin, Cara, are so well-developed, the reader can identify with their feelings and motivations. This is the best book in an excellent series that just keeps getting better.	2001-10-22

Normally I'm a fan of the Abigail Timberlake series, so I was looking forward to this latest entry. I came away extremely disappointed. The book was almost completely dialogue, so it was very fast-paced. There was very little setting and character detail, so the usual secondary charcters were barely seen and not developed at all. It was almost as if the author knew she had to get them in there, so she just made up a few scenes. This whole book seems as if it was thrown together. The author concentrates too much on trying to come up with witty or snappy dialogue, but it only ends up sounding phony. There's an alliteration on almost every page which is distracting and annoying. Nobody talks like that. The mystery is barely interesting, and the solving of it is unbelievable since there was too little attention paid to the storyline and too much on Abigail's comments. Overall, this was a very poor entry in the series.	2001-08-08

What began as a refreshing series about a former nun adapting to the secular world and unwittingly becoming caught up in murder investigations, has become boring, predictable, and unbelievable. In this book, I found that I didn't care who killed the victim or why. Chris takes it upon herself to investigate, which I found extremely far-fetched. How many wives and mothers have time to involve themselves in a murder case? There was no need for her to get involved here, and I found myself rooting for the people she interviewed. What makes her think she has any right to question people? She doesn't work for the police.This just doesn't ring true. The reader can't identify with these actions. In addition, the story reads almost like a journal in that all the minutiae of Chris' life are captured: her son takes a nap; he wakes up; he has a snack, etc. Who cares? Chris rarely shows any emotion, and her character even seems bored. For this series to continue, Chris needs to become more three-dimensional, and her involvement needs to be scaled back unless she finally decides to become a cop.	2001-03-29

However, this book is so ridiculous and far-fetched, it's an insult to the reader. The series just keeps getting worse. Angie is very hard to relate to. How many of us have no jobs but can afford designer clothes and Ferarri Testarossas? Her bubble-headedness is supposed to be endearing, I'm sure; it just ends up being annoying. How long is this relationship between Angie and Paavo going to go nowhere? The charcters are not likable, and the plot is absolutely absurd. Anyone looking for a good cozy should bypass this book.	2001-01-10

I highly recommend this book for those mystery fans who like light, cozy stories.	2000-11-12

The characters are not interesting or even likable, and the plot is not engaging. Lucy, the protagonist, is a whining, complaining nuisance. I found it hard to relate to her and her problems. At the end when Lucy is confronted by the murderer, I found the conclusion extremely far-fetched and unrelated to the rest of the story. It seems as if little thought went into making this a good mystery, but rather another book to add to the series.	2000-11-09

Torrey Tunet is back in Ireland working on a series of children's books, but gets distracted as she tries to help her friend who is accused of murdering her grandfather. While the plot is interesting, there is no cozy feel to this book. Torrie's character is rather one-dimensional and unappealing. There are no really likable characters in the book to inspire the reader to want to continue this series. However, as a mystery, it held my interest. If that's what you're looking for, you'll like this book.	2000-10-10

I started the series because I spent my summers at the Jersey Shore, and I thought that this would be a refreshing theme in an inundated mystery market. While the descriptions of the shore are accurate and well-done, there is nothing special or remarkable about the series to spur the reader to continue. Anne is rather one-dimensional; you don't really get to know her. There's little emotion from her, no humor, and little interpersonal interaction. It's as if she's just going through the motions of trying to solve the mystery, which is uninteresting itself. The characters are predictable and typical Hollywood types, all unlikable. I had to force myself to finish. If a new mystery series is to succeed, the main character has to be fully developed so that the reader cares what happens to her. In a continuing series, the supporting characters should be interesting and likable. This series doesn't have either.	2000-09-21

Frankly, I can't understand the extremely negative and hostile reviews for this debut mystery in a new series. Hillary and Jane are not stereotypical characters; they have completely opposite personalities which allows for some very comical interactions. The characters are interesting and  well-defined, and the interactions between Jane and her 10 year old  daughter are very credible. The plot is interesting, although not extremely  complex, but who says that all mysteries have to have a long convoluted  plot line? This book is entertaining and worth the read.	2000-04-25

It is up to the cousins to explore the estate known  as The Creepers and to question the Burgess family members to find out who  may want to get rid of old Leota. The plot is interesting and the  interaction between the characters is engaging and credible. The only  problem I have is with the title. It doesn't make much sense given the  situation in the story. Yes, there is a Suzette, a marginal character. I  suppose &quot;Creeps&quot; is referring to the estate. The title is just  too cutesy for the quality of writing in the book. The author has a strong  enough reputation that she shouldn't have to come up with silly titles.	2000-04-07

The cozy, hometown feeling was missing, in large part due  to the absence of some very central characters; Alice-Ann, Garnet, and  Greta. Tori's relationships with these people provided the warmth that  makes this series stand out from others. It seemed like Tori was just going  through the motions each day to make up for her missing friends. Although  the plot was interesting, Tori needed the interactions with the important  people in her life to make a more balanced story.	2000-04-05

It was setting up to be a cozy &quot;locked-door&quot; mystery, when it suddenly took a turn in a  different and inexplicable direction. I have to agree with the other  reviewers that the constant references to C.J.'s intelligence were  annoying, unnecessary, and distracting. The conclusion wasn't  earth-shattering or even satisfying, but I won't give up on the series  because of this one weak entry.	2000-03-22

The problem I have, though, is that Mandy is all business. There is no &quot;coziness&quot; here for those  who like that type of mystery. Mandy doesn't have a social life or any fun.  Her on again off again relationship with the detective is going nowhere  fast. To make this series excellent, there needs to be a balance between  Mandy's business/amateur detective life and her social world.	2000-03-22

Faith spends the entire story obsessing over her lost treasures and trying to get  them back. Her job and family take a back seat. While having a home robbed  is not pleasant, at least no one was hurt. I felt like telling her to get  over it already.

While the mystery is enjoyable, the series is becoming a bit too  predictable. One of the main characters is usually a suspect, and the rest  of the characters try to solve the mystery. As mystery readers know, you  must suspend belief somewhat when reading the genre, but in normal life,  how many of us or our friends are murder suspects? This is happening too  often in this series.

I'm an avid mystery reader, so I know what it takes to &quot;hook&quot; a reader. This book didn't have it. The setting was  depressing, the characters uninteresting and unlikable, and I honestly  didn't care about the storyline.

In this story, Lucy was preoccupied with herself, and her  family took a backseat as she tried to discover a murderer and contemplated  an affair; a not-so-believable twist in the plot. The reader gets a  confusing view of Lucy's husband: on the one hand, he's a traditionalist  who wants his wife at home; on the other, he'd like her to do what she  wants. In the other books, one gets a sense that this is a good marriage.  In this book, one wonders what these two have in common. The murder story  even took a back seat to Lucy's preoccupation with herself. Was this a  muder mystery or a woman's struggle with mid-life crisis? In the end, the  resolution is anticlimactic, and the reader is left with some negative  thoughts toward Lucy Stone.	1999-04-12

This could have been a great cozy whodunit; snowed in  at a mountain retreat, a number of suspects, no one getting in or out, etc.  The background of the characters just wasn't interesting or identifiable to  the reader. Also, too many corpses were piling up, which just was not  believable. Daheim usually has funny characters and plot lines, but this  entry just didn't work.	1998-09-18

However, the author constantly urges parents to  push math and science so that girls can get high paying jobs in traditionally male-dominated jobs. To me, this doesn't make a girl successful. It's fine if a girl's interests are in the math and science fields, but we shouldn't just expose them to these areas.  Also, the author makes it sould like a woman who chooses to raise a family is from the dark ages. This life choice is not encouraged, and that's a disservice to women who want to make family the top priority in their lives.	1998-07-04
