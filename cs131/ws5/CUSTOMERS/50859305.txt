One type of citation I needed was not in the book and I finally had to search for the MLA website. That is the reason I do not give this book 5 stars, they do not list their own website for up-to-date style references.

But if you are a first time reader of these stories be warned there are no footnotes, endnotes, or explanations of unfamiliar terms - so you could find yourself at a bit of a loss.    The book contains the third edition of \\"Frankenstein\\" originally published in 1831, I understand from other readings that Shelley made some changes in the text itself. The third, and last, edition includes the introduction she finally wrote for the novel.    For the experienced gothic reader or the novice willing to look up unfamiliar words, this book is a treasure as it has the three most famous and chilling gothic stories of the 19th century.    Enjoy them thoroughly and chillingly.	2004-10-04

Sorry, no. There's everything you need to furnish a home that would delight any child but not one house to put everything in. <br />Now if you are looking for furniture patterns in plastic canvas, this is the book for you. The living room, bedroom, laundry, bathroom, and patio are all here. Add the camper with accessories, you'll have tons to make for your fashion doll fan.<br />So for me - who was looking for a house pattern - this book is a disappointment, but for you - who might be looking for furniture patterns - this book could be a gold mine.

It is a book that will help you understand the history of loomed beading, how to do it, and how to design your own patterns.<br />I recommend this book for beaders who are experienced with looming and want to expand their horizons, because it will do that.<br />I will admit tho, I think this book is worth it for the eye candy alone!	2003-08-07

It's nice to look at the framed art as examples within the pages.<br />Now, this book claims it's easier and cheaper to do this work yourself - it is if you have a table saw and other power tools already on hand. The recommended mat cutter is almost $300.<br />There are lovely ideas in this book but I don't think it holds up its claim of being cheaper unless you are going to do a lot of framing work. I picked it up at the library with the idea of framing my beadwork, but with starting costs and skills to learn to do this work I'll pay for professional framing and use my time and money for beads and my own work! <br />If you are interested in learning to do this work, I'd say that this is a good book for you to start with. If you're an artist looking to frame your own work, think about how much time you'll be investing in learning to do this work when you could be working on your art.	2003-03-25

Very few end with \\"they lived happily ever after\\" and even less beginning with \\"once upon a time\\".<br />Containing cannabilism, incest, murder, sex, and a host of many things not consider \\"good\\" for children. Many of these stories evoke visions of Vincent Price rather than the canned, sanitized Disney movies. These are stories of goodness and purity most often - not always! - winning the day. The wicked are punished brutally for their misdeeds.<br />Printed on yellowed paper with both black and white and color illustrations it feels as if you are reading a book far older than it is. The story structure is rough, crude because these are oral stories written down perhaps for the first time when the Brothers gathered them. The language and pacing stay true to this oral tradition making the reading rough to a reader used to modern well edited stories. I could almost smell the smoke from the poorly vented fireplace as an old grandmother spun a tale to frighten and delight.<br />Grimm's Grimmest has more incommon with Freddy Kruger and Jeffery Dahmer than Disney - definitely not for the squeamish.	2003-03-02

But that's not the beauty of this lovely book, the patterns are. From the simple Stars &amp; Swirls Forever bracelet to the Tranquility tapestry with its gathered thread work, you can then tackle the Floral Fantasy and Owl Flight split loom necklaces. All colors are given with the Delica color number and approximate grams needed.<br />This is a beautiful book of patterns with full-color pictures of each finished project. I would suggest this one for a beader with some experience in looming.	2003-02-25

It ends with a nice bibliography until you can do further research on Zulu beadwork and several blank pages in the back.<br />Sadly the only color pictures are on the front cover.

Add the Elysian Fields Guesthouse (a rundown bed and breakfast) with a hole to Hell in the furnace room, an evil Keeper doing a Sleeping (not-so) Beauty in Room Six, the ghost of a sailor who died in the hotel in the attic, and the near-sighted, well-built handyman, Dean (sigh!) - well, what's a Keeper to do?! Run the place!<br />With sarcastic comments from Hell adding to the confusion as well as tempting Claire in the morning every morning in her mirror - btw, Hell talks to itself. Claire is more than a little frustrated by the situation because it looks like she's going to be stuck there the rest of her life!<br />In the meantime, guests keep showing up and they aren't your average guests - a vampire, a pair of werewolves, a tour of retired Olympians (think Mt Olympias, not the Olympics here), and a medium - Claire has her hands full. Not to mention a mouse problem or an imp problem, Claire insists.<br />My favorite part is Halloween when they get more than the average trick-or-treaters. The pacing is excellent and humor laces everything - even Hell.<br />So book your trip to Kingston and get a room at the Elysian Fields Guesthouse, just remember the rules:<BR> Never tell anyone where to go - they might!<BR> Don't wake HER in Room Six.<BR> Ignore the dead guy and the brightly colored mice or imps - whichever you prefer.<BR> The Historian is on the left side of Reality and the Apothecary on the right.<BR> Compliment the cook, he's a hunk and he does windows too!<BR> Ignore any voices speaking in block letters in your head.<BR> And don't forget to feed the cat!!	2003-02-17

But I think that a valid argument has been made for Walter Richard Sickert as the killer. Most of the primary source material for the claims are from the 1800s rather than referencing material written and interpreted by intermediary sources.<br />I would have liked to have seen more samples of the Jack the Ripper letters and Walter Sickert's handwriting until I would have been allowed to draw my own conclusions. The other murders mentioned, but not originally attributed to the Ripper, could have been the work of the Ripper or a copycat - I will not comment further on that.<br />What I truly found fascinating was the examination of the evidence with the comparison of how modern forensic science would handle the same evidence interesting in the extreme. It is amazing to see how far science and criminal justice has come in just over a hundred years.<br />This book is not written to transport the reader to the dark, damp streets of London in 1888. This book is written in a way as to allow a 21st century reader interested in the Ripper case a chance to look at the evidence, procedures, and police work of that time. A resident of that era would not realize that the bull's-eye lantern carried by the police and shown in the papers as \\"beacons of light shining on the victims\\" were little better by our standards than a flashlight with dead batteries.<br />In truth, I find myself more aware of how dark and squalid the world of Jack the Ripper would have been. We see movies, but they must be lit until we can see what is happening -- when in actually most of the Ripper's victims could probably see no more than a few feet in front of them at the time of their deaths. I suspect to get a true taste of the nights would require one to close a room until it is completely dark then light a single candle, not one with a well trimmed wick, but one that gutters and spits in the melting wax and slightest drafts.<br />Whether or not a case is made does not matter to me. I found this book a fresh look at both a series of old murders and the time in which the occurred. In many ways, the Ripper case is no longer about who did it but the society that spawned the killer and the succeeding generations' interpretations of the evidence and society.<br />It was an excellent read, though it did jar at times in the beginning when the voice of the modern forensic scientist stepped in. But I quickly became accustomed to the intrusion and welcomed the insights it brought.<br />Was Walter Richard Sickert Jack the Ripper? Perhaps. I know that were I on the jury I would be looking very carefully at the evidence present and how it was processed.	2003-02-04

Three are button projects that include thoughts on how to use antique buttons without major damage to the value of the buttons. There is one knotted necklace at the beginning of the book. There are three lariat ideas.<br />Section two is devoted to the creative process, how to find inspiration, and use color and style in jewelry.<br />I see this book as half inspiration and half instruction.

Ms Guidice shows you how to &quot;enhance&quot; the face the doll came with rather than totally wiping the face and repainting it. (The idea of repainting a doll's face scares me something awful.)<br />You will learn how to give a fashion doll a &quot;perm&quot;, enhance the makeup, and generally glitz up the doll's face and hair. She shows you how to create the costume on the front of the book and then opens her gallery of dolls to see what she has done with this &quot;basic&quot; beginning.<br />I'd recommend that anyone considering trying fashion doll makeovers to start with this book.

There are a few projects in each chapter but I really love the Designer's Notes at the end of the chapter. These pages include sketches of other ideas that can be created with the technique just learned.<br />The gallery is yummy with enough to whet your appetite for more or better yet, making your own masterpiece(s).<br />But the Appendix is what I really love about this book. There are guides to bead sizes, a standard list of jewelry lengths, and pictures of basic jewelry findings. Plus a glossary of precious and semiprecious stones; a beader's glossary of terms; birthstones - both traditional and astrological; blank graphs for loom/square, peyote, and brick stitches.	2003-01-02

There is also included an artisan's statement giving you insight into how the artisan sees his/her work.<br />As this was originally published in 1992 some of the resources are out of date but a web search will remedy that. Also, don't buy this book for instructions on how to do the beadwork, this is strictly eye-candy and how sweet it is! This is the book I pull from my shelf often to remind me of how much I love this medium, how far I have to go in my explorations, and how much fun getting there will be!<br />Sadly this book is out of print, but if you are a serious beadworker or someone who wants to see the best that beadwork can be - spend the time and money to get a copy of this treasure.	2002-12-10

I'll start with a quote from the introduction \\"our aim is to draw attention to objects decorated with, and constructed from, the tiny glass 'seed' beads\\" (pg 8 introduction). I will attest to the fact that the authors have succeeded in the most magnificent fashion!<br />Divided into deceptively simple sounding sections, this book will take you on a trip around the world and through history. The six sections are: Bead Manufacturing Centers; Africa; the Americas; Asia, Oceania, and the Arabian Gulf; Europe; and Construction and Techniques. Then each of these sections is divided into the the various countries and regions covered with the broad section heading. There are photographs everywhere - color, black & white, historical, and studio quality. This is a very visual book for a visual medium.<br />I've always felt as a beader that I am carrying on a tradition that goes back centuries, this book pays homage to the traditions from around the world. It is an incredible resource that belongs on every beader's shelf for inspiration and rememberance of all that has come before. This book will be to beadwork what \\"The History of Beads\\" is to beads and bead collectors.<br />TWO NOTES:<BR>ONE: The section on Construction and Techniques is not meant to teach you how to do a particular type of beadwork, but to give you an idea of what is involved. There are several excellent teaching books available.<BR>TWO: On page 151, there is a set of beaded sleeves from a dress from Western Europe that are absolutely breath-taking.	2002-11-12

You will also find information on color.<br />The gallery is actually two sections. Two pages are devoted to a few of the Bead Quilt squares created in memory of the September 11th, 2001, attacks. The other section is lovely in that it show a few of the possiblities inherent in bead embroidery.<br />Overall it's an excellent book and a good addition to any beader's, embroiderier's, or quilter's library.	2002-10-25

Not for Beginners	For those of you who don't know what french beading is - it is the creation of flowers with wires and beads. Yes, that is a very simple description of a very complex process. I picked this book up expecting needleweaving - peyote, brick, loom, square - anything but what I found inside.<br />I have not yet tried french beading but the project I found in this book would tempt me to try. The pictures are clear and in good color with good instructions. The wisteria worked with a root and displayed in a bonsai vase definitely has my attention.<br />There is some jewelry with wire and beads done in right angle weave, crochet, and knitting.<br />This book is NOT for beginners. It is for those who want to push the envelope of french beading to see where it leads. I just wish the author had chosen another title as I'm afraid this one will lead people to believe it leans to the needleweaving style of beadwork.	2002-10-25

There are projects to practice each stitch, as well as, a couple in the combining stitches chapter.

Each work is accompanied by brief statements by the artists to help you understand what the artist was thinking, feeling at the time of creation. <br />Now for the reason for my disappointment is that I am an avid fan of The New Beadwork by Kathlyn Moss and Alice Scherer, I would have been extremely happy with The Best in Contemporary Beadwork. Some of what I miss in Contemporary Beadwork is the simple biographical information of year and place of birth, and current residence, but mostly I miss the notation of date of creation, materials, techniques, and size. <br />Let me stress that Contemporary Beadwork is well worth the money, despite the lack of details.	2000-07-30
