Books	3	2	2	N	N	fluffy brainless fun	Another book to support Kinsella's perky thesis that if you're a spunky, pretty young gal you can do awful things or be a terrible person and it will be cute and funny and all will turn out well. You can see what's coming a mile ahead in this book, plot-wise, but let's face it, there's good dark chocolate and then there're Jolly Ranchers, and sometimes the cheap overly sweet crap is just what you need.	2005-04-29

But were they really friends? Lucy Grealy herself was conflicted. She wanted to be treated special, but not to be special for what it was that really did make her special: her face. Grealy herself wrote an autobiography, so didn't if she didn't want to lay open her life for scrutiny, why did she do that? After reading this, I wonder if Lucy Grealy really had any friends. It seems to me that, based on Patchett's book, Grealy acted and was treated like a pet monkey. Patchett even calls her \\"pet!\\" It reminded me of a recent biography of a friendship with JFK Jr. The author was as close as he got to being a friend, yet really did not have the realy intimacy because JFK Jr was special, and the author held back because no one could ever get past that awareness. A real friend wouldn't let Grealy get away with the sh&* she pulled. I wonder if Grealy had ever had a real friend, one who didn't treat her like Helen Keller's family did before the arrival of Ann Sullivan, and if she did, whether she might be alive today. I like the writing of this book, and was interested to learn about the world of academic creative writers -- prizes and grants and fellowships and so forth -- where most writers toil without ever becoming famous the way Patchett and Grealy did. Very interesting to read, especially if you read Grealy and Patchett's other work.	2005-02-20

As thorough as the series was, there are reams or reels or whatever of footage that never made it onto TV, so this book provides more information about Edwardian life, the participants and events of the series. It's an oversize book which unfortunately makes for awkward reading -- and it does have a lot of text that you'll want to read. However, the size makes for good display of photos, including many taken in Edwardian times and even at Manderstone, the house where the series was shot. So you see that they really did dress up in a thousand items of clothing just to watch cricket on the lawn or stroll around the grounds. A fascinating addition to a well-made series. I loved the series and could have watched ten times what they showed on TV and therefore really appreciate this book.	2004-08-20

Frances Kuffel is believer in the addiction model of overeating and the 12th step method of coping with it. This means that she is absolutely powerless over food and until she admitted it, really devoted most of her life to sneaking vast amounts of food. So she became and remained very fat, then, she at middleaged, she started attending Overeaters Anonymous and following their system of dealing with it: for the rest of her life eating nothing but exactly weighed and measured portions of mainly vegetables and fruit, phoning a sponsor every morning to pre-repoert exactly what her day's eating shall include. By doing so she has gotten down to, at her best (with many relapses up the other way) to 168 lbs. But from her side, it's super thin, gorgeous, haute couture-wearing, worthy of being-scoped-out-by-Eric-Clapton-SUPER THIN!! She's SO beautiful, as she reports so many people telling her! She has no thighs AT ALL!! Which is interesting, because to me, 168 lbs is shoot-myself FAT. Size 16. One definitely has thighs at 168. One is singularly unworthy of being scoped out by a rock legend. One does not fit in Dolce and Gabbana, unless it's special sizing for wealthy NYC matrons. If Kuffel loses another 45 lbs AND quits smoking, I'll grant her the self-aggrandizing of this book. But that just goes to show you, that to a thin person, 168 lb would be horrible, but to a 313 person it's Paris Hilton thin. It's all in your perspective. France's writing is not good enough to warrant this book's hype, but combined with a very respectable, hard-won weight loss, I'm sure it's a good start in launching her self esteem towards one day actually being thin and fit. Good start, honey!	2004-07-20

I somehow expect Vogue Knitting or The Big Book of Knitting to have everything, but it's The Knitter's Handbook that actually does. It's not as sexy as the other two, and maybe that's why I forget I even have it. I have an older edition of this, and it could be vastly improved with more photographs. The graphics provided are okay, but they're just weird to my eye in this age of easy-to-reproduce color photographs. This book is a knitting reference book. so it may not be the greatest for someone trying to teach themself to knit, but if the person learns and keeps knitting, s/he'll end up loving this volume.	2004-05-25

Maybe he was nagged to write a book about his experience to the point that he finally just wrote it to get everyone off his back. He's very angry person who seems to think that that's fine with his family, that they had worked it out and accept his hair- trigger temper as just a loveable quirk. I don't mind that he is angry about his illness. For once, someone does not get all gooey about illness, but just presents it as pain, obstacle, a waste of life force that Cohen would rather have spent on his career or family or anything else. And why not? I appreciate his rage, rage, rage against the dying of the light (literally, in his case). Not everyone can be ennobled by illness, and I'll bet it's actually a relief to many sufferers to learn they have a kindred soul in NOT being more than average and in hating their illness and what's been stolen from them. There are better, more eloquent books about what it's like to have illness (\\"Time on Fire,\\" for one) interrupt your life, steal your time, youth, freedom, independence and love and patience. This book feels like it is a narration to which I'm missing the pictures -- Richard Cohen was in TV, after all, and is used to having the pictures do most of the talking. I don't \\"see\\" this book at all, feel like I'm being lectured at, and found Cohen to be a very hostile, unpleasant person to the point where, although I believe his resentment is justified, I didn't enjoy being around him during the time spent reading his book.	2004-05-21
US	51051413	R26ORU4RJ79TSE	0809243156	959295889	The Royal Jewels	Books	5	21	21	N	N	Excellent	It's hard to imagine what one did to learn about the jewelry collection, state and personal, of British royalty before this book. Reading Suzy Menkes' preface give you an idea: you research it and write a book. And that is what she did. This book is scholarly, it's interesting, it's personal. It answers so many questions: what jewelry is owned by the royal family, and what belongs to the UK? Why does the queen wear some jewels and not others? What are those little portrait brooches on ribbon? What happens to all the jewels give the royal family? How did they acquire the jewels that they now wear? The royal jewel collection is richer and more vast than you'd ever guess from just tracking the jewels you've seen the queen and her family wear in the last few decades, and much of it was acuired from Queen Victoria's reign and onward. Up until Victoria and the spoils of British Empire, kings or queens would have to hire jewels to put in their crown frames when they needed to attend some regal function --their own coronation, for example. Suzy Menkes has done a fantastic job of finding out the history and use of the most magnificent jewel collection in the world. The paintings and photographs show many of the jewels on the original recipient or acquirer (Queen Mary's avid, avaristic jewel-buying is reponsible for the much of the jewel wealth the family now possesses) and how they've been reset by subsequent owners. In spite of being scholarly, The Royal Jewels is not at all dry. Menkes has gleaned a lot about the personalities of the wearers. And the politics!! Who gets what, and when they get it, the curiously paltry amount jewels Princess Diana (still living at the time of the latest edition of this book) and the Duchess of York received from their in-laws. An amazing book, essential to anyone interested in jewels, the British Royal Family, even history.	2004-05-01
US	51051413	RIN7AWNYF7QL1	0312272057	433455404	Dry: A Memoir	Books	5	19	24	N	N	wow	One of the finest memoirs I've ever read, I could not put it down. It shows what the real bottom of hitting bottom in addiction is like, without the slightest bit of almost...bragging that some memoirists have done, like in Permanent Midnight, where you believe that the author is sort of secretly impressed by his low, that he's showing it off, that he's manipulating the reader. The real story of the low is horrible, it's not glamorous but it is spectacular. I truly did not understand alcoholism until I read this book. Burroughs sense of irony is brilliant. He uses it to explore a point, to take a good look at himself, not to hold the reader at arm's length  or, and here I find myself saying it once again, show off. I think every Burroughs book has at least three brilliant thoughts or sentences, that are so good you want to write them down and email them to your friends, that show you something utterly familiar in an absolutely original way. This is like David Sedaris on ... well, crack. Or alcohol. I appreciate Burroughs surviving to write on. And on.	2004-04-02

To start with, the characters are too black and white, and not well drawn. Some characters don't even have names, they're a category: \\"The Questioner\\" and so forth. The characters that do have names are given characteristics much more that features. Chanu, the husband, is a pompous gasbag in the way that only the men of patriarchal cultures can be. He is a castles-in-the-air-type of person, and we read over and over about the selfish things he does, how he lords over and oppresses his wife and two daughers, how fat and revolting he is physically. His wife, Nazneen, married off by her father is virtuous, thoughtful, pious and not only runs the household, but ends up supporting her family with sewing piece-work. This book is LOOOOOOOONGGG, at least a hundred pages too long, and not in the good way. It's long in the way that has you skimming over pages, especially the ones about the Muslim group forming, losing your place and not caring, and basically just trying to get through it. After all that work, the denoument doesn't satisfy -- one can't believe that characters that have been shown to act one way (over and over and over) would suddenly start acting otherwise so the book could have the endig it did. Skip it.	2004-03-22

And Dunmore managed to take my breath away time and again with pitch perfect turns of phrase: &quot;...morning sunlight as sharp as lemons.&quot; Of course. That is exactly how it is.

Maybe because s/he's a Professional Writer s/he  can hardly let such a rare life experience go unexamined, unwritten about, s/he has written a book about a deeply personal life experience in the most superficial way possible. It's quite banal, and as a result, boring. The correspondence between Richard Russo and Finney is transcribed, almost as if to show just how clever the emails between Professional Writers can be, and maybe holds the ulterior motive of pulling in fans of the far more successful Russo. This book seems very calculated, as if maybe this is an effort towards a Pulitzer like Russo's and of which Boylan is so transparently evious.	2003-11-10

GRAB IT. Because the knitting world is very exclusive. Yarns come and go; they're issued like fashion collections and disappear just as quickly. And patterns, well, you may think of them like a classic -- Moby Dick can always be found, right? It's more like a magazine. You'll see it around for a month or two, and then good luck tracking down another copy if you didn't save it. It's one of the reasons knitters turn into such hoarders and savers, afraid to let go of that 12 inches of Scottish Heather because who knows where they'll find that yarn again? And of all the yarn companies and pattern designers, Rowan was worst of all.<BR>Their pattern books were more like vintages of wine. Good luck getting your hands on a good year once the word is out. Until now. FINALLY. Finally, someone at Rowan has had the sense to realise that these patterns are wanted, needed, and they deserve to live on with new knitters discovering them  and experienced knitters turning back to them again and again, if not to knit, that just to enjoy the design work, or get an idea for a collar or sleeve. This doesn't have all of Rowans patterns, but it has many of the best, and a smattering of all the patterns and designers. It's got some stunning works and many ideas from the best design handknit design company in the world today. A must-have, and a great deal.	2003-07-23

The thing is, Wharfe doesn't want to tell too much, so there's not much new here. There's a lot of self aggrandizement -- how Wharfe saved the day, this time and that time, how the \\"most beautiful photos ever\\" (in his opinion) were the result of his taking a island holiday situation in hand. And of course, how if HE had been still providing protection, she would not have died. The thing is, let's face it, Diana did not protect herself. SHE did not wear her seatbelt, SHE put her well-being in Dodi's unctuous hands and she herself, as Wharfe notes, was one to drive at speeds of up to 100 MPH.<BR>I think there's much more Wharfe has to say, and why not?

But by the end of the book, I wondered: Did Fremont learn NOTHING from her parents? Because to them, this \\"secret\\" which was basically right out there and not too hard to figure out -- was LIFE and DEATH matter to them. Survival, at its most elemental. And Fremont blabs it, being in one of the few countries in the world where you can blab your or your family's secrets and live to blab and blab some more. Telling her cousin was reprehensible--she would have figure it out, just the same as Fremont did.

This book is laugh-aloud funny, spot-on social commentary to scour our smarmy, collective perceptions and foibles cleaner than any upper colonic. It's not for the faint-hearted nor those who wish to remain deluded, but for everyone else it's a relief, like the collective popping of every helium balloon-headed star. She is way too young to be this wise and way too American to be so well-educated and cable of processing her thoughts. And may she continue writing for the rest of the long life she has to live, providing some movie star or the city of LA doesn't put out a hit on her.	2001-12-16

That and the honesty. I haven't made Donofrio's mistakes, but have had my own brand of sordid past, and I learned from Donofrio and myself and still want to heal and have God or some representative (Mary?) in my life. This books shows how the truth --raw, unflinching -- makes for breathtaking narrative. I wish I had Donofrio's guts.	2001-12-12

And I loved Melanie Falick's book, Knitting in America. But I hate this book for its design. It's an awkward shape (why haven't more people caught on to the brilliance of the purse-sized VK Knitting on the Go series of books?), and the faded pictures of the yarn stores and owners...they look like the printer printed the blue line proofs by mistake. I mean, knitting is nothing if not about color and texture, up close. The patterns were disappointing to me too. Very few I would actually make. Maybe the store owners didn't want to give up the rights to the really good, classic patterns, the ones that really sell? I hope someone else takes a crack at this great idea.	2001-11-20

We in a democracy are more likely to be outraged at an entire family being held responsible for the actions of one member. In other parts of the world, a family like the Oufkirs who benefited royally from the father's power will of course be brought down with their father. It is not clear what Oufkir's father did, besides the attempt at a coup, but I feel like that information is necessary to understand this story, and Malika does not provide it. Overall, I don't find Oufkir's story terribly credible. There are too many contradictions. For example, in one sentence she says they got to spend times out in a court yard together all day, and in the same paragraph she says family members for years only saw each other by reflection of water in a shared gutter. Elsewhere she claims she and her brother seduced two people on a train to help them in their escape; this after saying her brother had three teeth and a mouth full of abcesses and that she herself was so swollen from malnutrition that she could barely fit through the escape tunnel, and that they were dressed in years-old rags... From Malika's laughable self-aggradizement throughout the book, I wonder if she doesn't suffer from some mental disorder. Malika does acknowleged and understand that she was just as imprisoned in her first 18 years of life as she was in the second half, but notice she only considers the second half that she supposedly spent in prison as &quot;stolen.&quot; She doesn't seem to have much of a problem with the ridiculuous level of wealth and privilege she had in the first 18 years in contrast to the poverty in which the majority of her countrymen were living in at the time. I found this book poorly written and an insult to rational minds everywhere.	2001-10-16

I'll never get any closer to these worlds than I will through a book. I enjoyed reading about the life--the day-to-day aspects. No detail is too small. And as with mountaineering, the reality of being a bike messenger in a big city in the extreme weather of the midwest is much more gritty, dangerous and difficult than I could have dreamed.

It's really a mystery, one that unfolds in the most interesting way. It's like the movie Memento, or the India wedding trip episode of Seinfeld. You start out knowing the end result: someone's drowned--but someone named Ruth is alive in the book--and you won't find out how it plays out until the very end. I loved the setting, and found the austere writing tone really appropriate to the time period. I am from the midwest, and found the author was spot on in describing the seasons and weather and how lives play out according to it. I really enjoy how the author tangles up the lives of the characters, and this is a remarkable first effort. If Schwarz keeps this up, she'll be the American answer to Margaret Atwood.	2001-06-04

The pictures, the history, the patterns in the book thrill me, and I look forward to learning how to make these impossible-looking designs come alive with yarn. Not only did I find the history compelling, but Lavold is a great designer. Watch how she runs bands of cables up the front of a cardigan, then they turn a corner at the shoulders and meet at the middle back of the neck to form a yoke. Incredible. I rarely knit from patterns and I have never seen a knitting book from which I actually intend to make so many designs. There are entire patterns -- heavy coats and pullovers of Lopi, a light blouse cardigan of Silketweed, hat and mitten set, pillow and afghan. It's mostly sweaters for women in different weights, but there are few other things for household, child, and men. There are also charts for pieces of cable and motifs so that you can create your own designs, as well as a rune alphabet in case you want to knit a message on your sweater in the stick-like figures; it would look just like a thicket of trees. The more I look through this book, the more I appreciate it. It's up their with Starmore's Aran Knitting for scholarship and design and beauty.	2001-03-21

It's hard to compete with the likes of such genius as Meg Swansen, Alice Starmore, Kim Hargreaves... Nothing in this book is very stylish or classic.

Okay, it would help to know a little bit about golf--even though you kind  of can figure things out eventually. Maybe tack a glossary on the back in  future editions? Because golfer or not, this is a great book. The premise  is smart: over 50% of American men believe that, if things had just worked  out right, they could have been a professional athlete. John Paul Newport  gets specific: could have been a GOLFER. So he puts that hypothesis to the  test, and designates a year of his (and his wife and kid's) life &quot;The  Year of Golf.&quot; This is an honest, funny and smart book.

She only left to get when another  instituion, marriage, was offered as an option after all. If I'm wrong and  Kaysen was debilitated by severe illness, then kaysen really downplayed her  illness and symptoms as dramatically as she thrills us with the &quot;loony  bin&quot; details in this book.

He  also knows how to crunch the numbers to learn the truth: how much will it  take if a late 30-something like himself wants to retire in an  &quot;active&quot; community (millions). Is buying a house really the  biggest economic plus you can tally? For such a public figure, Broncaccio  gives a lot of himself away in this fast, fun informative book.

Not in the least gimmicky for its letter-to-letter format, which goes to show it's  the real thing. A lovely movie also.	1999-10-05
