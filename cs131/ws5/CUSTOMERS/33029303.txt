Too bad for him, since the Vietnam Air Force veteran has been grounded in Michigan, living a quieter life on a farm. But as plans heat up for his youngest daughter's wedding, there's a lot going on in the Gruen family: Will's wife plans on turning the farm into a bed-and-breakfast; his oldest daughter, living an open marriage, returns home for the wedding with her son but not her husband; and the youngest is showing ambivalence about walking down that long aisle. Set in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, Flight is about the journeys we take and the journeys we want to take and all the decisions we make along the way.	2005-05-14

I was expecting a suspense novel, I was expecting a serial-killer novel - a good suspense novel, a good serial-killer novel, but still. However, like Dennis Lehane's Mystic River, this book is so much more than it needs to be. The relationships between the characters are so interesting and well-executed that I stopped caring after a while about whodunnit. And when I did figure it out? It was timed just right: just enough before it formally gets revealed to make the reader feel smart, but not so late that you're wondering why the professionals haven't figured it out yet, i.e., perfect. The Halo Effect is seriously compelling reading. I can't wait for the next entry in the series.	2004-07-27

Previously, I'd just known him as the bad-boy Emperor's New Clothes reviewer. Of course, he's disingenuous all over the place here, but I had so much fun with this collection of his critical essays. What I expected when I opened this book was the acerbic one-liners that have now become infamous; of course, I found those, but I also found someone who loves the world of writing so much that he hates it when writers with genuine talent squander their gifts. There is both bombast here and humility. I think one of the reasons Mr. Peck bothers the critical and literary establishment is not so much that he can be mean, which he can - I mean, who else says in the middle of a review, having summarized the plot and theme that took the author maybe years to produce, &quot;well, duh&quot; - but because there's that niggling suspicion that maybe he's right about a few things and that maybe it's a few more than a few things and that if the emperor isn't quite buck naked, his taste in clothing is both questionable and minimal. I only hope that someday my own novels are important enough that they show up on Mr. Peck's radar and he decides to take a hatchet to the things I'm doing wrong.	2004-07-06

Blair Clemens, a single mother and chef in California, is dying. When Luke Bellingham, a throwback to her high-school days who is now a successful Hollywood screenwriter, comes back into her life, what will she do? Is it OK for her to reach for love, knowing it can't possibly have a traditional happy ending? In less capable hands, this could be maudlin material, but not so with Ms. Sussman. Blair is such a strong heroine, and Ms. Sussman's technique of alternating chapters between Blair's and Luke's points of view is so effective and capably done, that what could and should by all rights be tragic instead comes off as a celebration of life and love. Readers will finish this novel looking forward to Ms. Sussman's next.	2004-04-20

The story of Isabel Green's marriage to Paul Simmons, and the resulting complications, reminded me of books where neither plot nor literary value are short-changed.

It's impossible to say one looks forward to reading or enjoys a book that takes as its kickoff the destruction of the World Trade Center. In a very basic way, I think that nearly each person, certainly everyone I know, feels as though they somehow own the events of that day. In my case, by virtue of sheer geography, I'm just two degrees of separation away, meaning that I didn't lose anyone directly, but the number of those lost by people I know is obscenely huge. And then there are the pictures of the commuter lots in the towns I know so well with all those cars belonging to people who never came home.<br />Rarely when reading a book have I been so aware of how the stylistic decisions an author makes affects the reader. Usually, I get annoyed with writers who don't offset dialogue in quotes; the absence of what is really itself a device somehow feels artificial and affected. But here that decision is a mercy. It creates just enough distance that the reader can get through the first 50-100 pages, knowing that Wendy, the 13-year-old girl who forms the heart of this story, will lose her mother when those planes hit. It's also a mercy having the tragedy occur relatively early on, so that both the reader and Wendy have sufficient time to recover.<br />In terms of plot, afterwards, Wendy negotiates her New York life with her stepfather and halfbrother and her California life with her birth father, who she's hardly seen in years. It's a true coming-of-age novel, turning on the greatest American tragedy in recent memory.<br />From what I remember of what little I heard people say of this book before I read it was that by virtue of subject matter and some people's impressions of the author, it must surely be exploitative. While I'm sure that as time goes on there will be exploitative novels written on the subject, this book isn't those books. It's not in the slightest exploitative; or, if it is, then every novelist who's ever written anything, sincere or no, is exploitative too. Rather, it impresses as being one person's attempt to use her art and talent to make sense of the incomprehensible.<br />One finishes the book admiring Wendy's strength and spirit, and wanting good things to happen to her and to all those who lost so much on that awful day when the sky was an incredible blue.who's ever written anything, sincere or no, is exploitative too.

When I heard that Molly Moynahan's novel was going to be on the NYTimes list of Notable Books for the year, I immediately moved it to the top of my TBR stack and, oh, am I glad I did. Seventeen-year-old Alice McGuire finds herself in the wrong kind of wonderland when Matthew Swan, her soul mate since very early childhood, vanishes while in Mexico. While coping with the grief of a loss that never should have happened, Alice becomes involved with tutoring prisoners in writing for her senior class project. I don't want to give anything away, but this is such a strong and sensitive novel, smart and sad, the best part of it being that the reader goes away feeling as though Ms. Moynahan will have a lot more good stories to tell.	2003-12-05

Not just a serious novel, however, there's more at work here: like wry humor, a strong protagonist whose survival-against-the-odds beyond the end of the novel is a comfort to imagine; and the fact that that protagonist is allowed to be achingly human to the point where he's borderline annoying, not in a truly annoying-annoying way, but in a nostalgic-annoying way that will make older readers fondly remember, \\"God, I remember when I was young and the whole world moved all around me.\\"...	2003-03-28

This one is unique.\\" Despite the enervating aspects of the lives Paige and Pinch lead - their mother leaves them to their own apartment when still in their early teens, more than one friend meets an early and unnecessary demise, etc - there is pride in place in this book and a strong core message that the saving graces in a pain-filled world are the love you're smart enough to give and the love you're lucky enough to receive. As such, this book about two bastards out of California belongs on the shelf right alongside the surprise bestsellers of last year - The Lovely Bones and Dive from Clausen's Pier - because not only does it get the grim reality right, but it doesn't forget about the other reality: the light that saves.	2003-03-28
