US	31304380	R16CS6NVW8ZNNU	0380820234	86692379	Forge of Heaven	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Politics & Art	I had thought I wrote a review on this story the when I read it for the first time, the day it came out. In any case...<br /><br />This is far from my favorite C J Cherry book...<br /><br />Which is to say it is a very good book, just not one of the top twenty books I've ever read.<br /><br /> Ms. Cherryh is in my opinion the greatest writer living or dead when it comes to culture, and world creating. In this story there are three which are dealt with. Primarily, there is the culture of a quarantined space station, what would make life worth living for young adults in a place where there is no real struggle or getting out. The moral of the story seems to be the role of art, (strangely in this story the art of personal appearance), in society. There is a typical Cherryh disdain for how politics always get in the way of good and talented people doing the right thing.<br /><br />Secondarily, the culture of the planet below is dealt with, including the immortality of the protagonist of the previous story.<br /><br />And finally, the outside universe is dealt with as the paranoid who are afraid of what they don't understand.<br /><br />So if you don't want a story where you have to think, then this is not a story for you. Of course if you don't want to think,  C J Cherryh is probably not the author for you. Try Koonts. Or maybe Matthew Reilly, (both are authors whom I enjoy) depending on how you don't want to think. However if you want to explore the \\"what if\\" side of human interaction, and the shades of gray in character, this is one you might enjoy. I did.	2005-10-13

Cherryh's great early works.<br /><br />Serpents reach is a masterpiece of world building as it gives a totally plausible, totally believable world where Ants are the intelligent and evolved race. It explores how virtual immortality could affect wealth power and family relations.  This is a great story about betrayal and revenge and acceptance.<br /><br />The Cuccoo' s Egg is another great story that might be compared to the part (the part that you don't get to read., about when Valentine Smith is still on Mars.)  of \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\"  As it is the story of a human boy raised on an alien planet by aliens, in an attempt to understand humans and to make up for killing humans. Hard to explain but a great read.<br /><br />If you don't already have these two great stories... This is a great book to buy.	2005-10-04

After the intervening years it still frightens me that the politics and the financial concerns of healthcare are put above saving lives. (some of her findings on AIDS and cancer were burried by her supervisors for political and monetary gain)<br /><br />This book details the struggles of one of the great scientific minds of our generation to tell the truth and help people. I find it interesting to find occasional news articles that fortify Dr. Pert's theories after it has been long enough to be someone else's idea.<br /><br />Although I have some issue with some of her conclusions about psycopharmacology, I am grateful that there are \\"Warriors of Truth\\" in health research such as herself, that put public health over career considerations.<br /><br />Interesting book about/by an interesting woman.	2005-09-03

While this is a pretty good story it leaves too much to the imagination on the future of Shai's character. Enjoyable, as it is written in the style of C J Cherryh, not quite satisfying as if it were her story.<br /><br />Really two novellas that would make one smallish novel by today's standards.

First of all in the interest of honesty, I have worked for Dr. Mckay in England. In the 25 years I have known him, I have benifitted from his advice on many issues and I even named my first born after him.<br /><br />This book is a great resource on several levels. It is a thought provoking read. It is written in a manner that can be used as a text book or as a suppliment for seminars. It can be used in the family as a dinner convesation guide. In particular, that is what it reminded me of, was dinner at the Mckay's, where I have had the priveledge a few times of being in some of those pick an issue apart conversations. I envy his University students that get to be involved with such at school.<br /><br />In any case, the advice contained in this book could have helped me reconcile issues that drove me to leave the world of corporate management years ago. I f you are interested in the ideas of being an ethical manager, this book is a must read.	2005-07-17

Having run out of books before I ran out of craving I found the Book of Shai. Although Ms. Cherryh is the translator not the author, her unique style of writing shines through making this if not a great story, at least a good one. The Book of Shai begins the adventures of a young man named Shai and his companions in a future where the Earths axis has tilted and the world we know has been basically destroyed. This is a smallish novela, though not as quick a read as the size might indicate, as you have to pay close attention to follow the jumps in the story.<br /><br />If unlike me you haven't already read everything else with CJ Cherryh's name on it, try one of her other stories, (Just be sure to start at the beginning of a series as her character development is always way to good to miss.)Down Below Station is as good a place as any to start as it can be seen as the introduction to the \\"Merchanter Universe\\". But if like me you just have to have more, this is a good story that you will probably enjoy.	2005-07-10

I will admit to having to have read it several times before understanding all of the nuance. A very well written book investigating the great question of philosphy... what is truth?<br />A stark look at bigotry. And a clarifying look at lonliness. A novella packed with tons to think about. A book I have bought several times and given to several people. An insightful story for the manager or politition. Not a quick read, but a satisfying one.	2005-07-10

Although I loved all of the Ender and Shadow novels best of all, I also loved the Sleeping Beauty retelling in Enchantment. Here OSC does for Shakespeare, what he did for Sleeping Beauty.<br />This is a slower building story than most of his work, but in the end very rewarding. If you enjoy fantasy with a modern twist this is a book for you. If you enjoy exploring motives and motivation of human nature, this is a book for you. As always love, honor and responsibility are the primary themes of this story. Definitely worth a read!	2005-07-03

I was recently given a copy of this book, and although I don't normally like to read the middle of a series without reading what lead up to the book first. Let me say I'm glad I made an exception with this book. First, it is well enough written where it mostly works as a stand alone. But moreso that here is an incredible writer that has been around a long time I have never read! Although romance is not my first love (pardon the pun), this succeeds in the same way some C J Cherryh books do, and this book does it better than say Ann McCaffrey (who is the author I think of when Sci Fic and romance are used together). This book is full of characters to love and to hate, plenty of action and introspection. Fast moving and thoughtful. Great book!<br />An author who is a Physicist/Ballerina, I will definitely be buying more of her books!	2005-06-22

Only the warrior is a human being,  because only the warrior decides his destiny. The odyssey of Musashi as he developes himself into the perfect warior is at once, funny, romantic, exciting, and most of all thought provoking. The actual writings of this man have been used for centuries as a model for excellence.

The most interesting twist for the reader is you are so immersed in the alien culture that the one human in the story is the dialog that has to be translated. The incredibly original idea of the cultures. What if Lions were the evolved species on a planet... What would they be like, what would their values be etc. To try to compare this work to any other author would be pitiful for example the Nivens stories about the Tiger men (Man Kizn Wars)pullleezz! No other author is in the same league when it comes to world building, and making plausible cultures and belief systems.<br />Another amazing thing is Ms. Cherryh is able to keep her many books to the same universe. All the stories can eventually be patched to an understanding in another. This book is also a great essay into the aspect of lonlines of responsibility, and of being culturally alone. If you have not read this series you are in for a treat!	2005-02-06

As I read the story and the LDS (Mormon) elements fascinated me as a convert to the LDS church myself. As I read further into the story I almost wondered if this was set as a piece of anti- Mormon propoganda.. As it laid the bad out with the good for you to examine. The story so much shows what it's like to be a Mormon in a Non-Mormon town it's scary. However as I finished the story I realized it shows how the faith of our people affects our life for good and ill. The wonderful story of a loving family in a completely different horor story is not to be missed. So if you like ghost stories, if you like family stories, or If you are interested in how different cultures fit together, you will love this story.

So get your towel, and a pack of peanuts, you can even put your head between your knees,(it won't help but you can do it if you like)<br />And open this book and Restaurant at the end of the universe. You will be glad you did. Now the other books have some funny stuff too, but you have to read a lot of not so funny stuff to get to it. The new movie version comes out soon... I can't wait!	2005-02-05

I like books to help me to be smarter or better. This is not one of those books. The author never pretends to be that kind of author. He is the kind of author you wish wrote the screenplays for action movies. He is a very young man, and writes the kind of stuff those appeals to him. Each of his books cover a very small period of time, usually less than a couple of days, because there is so much exciting action it would take a series of books to cover a week in one. Ice station is fun to read. The characters are really bad or really good the way people aren't, you always know who to hate and who to love. There are some great one liners that will make you laugh, and so much action you will finish this book in one reading. So if you want a fun action story that will not change your life, not tax your brain, but will keep you entertained... This is a book for you.	2005-02-05

Cha... That is the point of reading, to engage the mind! Now when a movie does that well, yes, that is irritating, when an author invites you to examine the way you think through his story he has done his job. Now if the characters don't generate your interest, sympathy, or antipathy, then you won't continue to read. Then you will have changed the way the author writes, or he/she will go broke.<br />That being said, I think that certain members of congress, and senate, not to mention our allies, could stand some of the preaching in this story. Now while I will admit, that some of the writing seems to be dumbed down, and that some is way too gruesome, (the whole details on the Mord Sith I could have done without), and it would be infinitely more readable, if the author would take a class in being concise (it seems like he might get paid by the page sometimes), I have enjoyed each of the stories and started on each one since the third, the week they come out. And finally, as to the Jordan comparison, the wheel of time and the Sword of truth stories are basically the same story, no doubt about it. Guess what? The sword of Truth stories are better, precisely because of the preaching. So there you go.<br /><br /> Update 2008<br /><br />If you are reading this in 2008 and the series is finished, be warned that a lot of the things I liked about this story became worn and tiresome by the time the story finishes with Confessor. If you are a speed reader, you still may want to read this saga, but if you aren't by the time you finish Faith of the Fallen, you may have had enough.<br /><br />Here's my ADHD recap.<br />Freedom is good, evil men despise freedom, love to torture, and will do all kinds of kinky disgusting things.<br /><br />If you go to the fan site for the stories you can get a list of the wizard's rules which are pretty good and food for thought. The problem with the stories start to developed when the author decides that the reader isn't smart enough to have the thoughts, so he pummels you over and over and over and over....(ad nausea)smart enough to have the thoughts, so he pummels you over and over and over and over....(ad nausea)	2005-02-05

If however you are easily offended, some of the laguage and sexual content may put you off. Let me reiterate, this is not a book for your kids. This is a book that keeps you guessing, people die, good guys, bad guys and pets. This is just the begginning of a very long and uncompleted story, but a very rewarding read.If you want something different,that still has swords, horses, politics, love, hate and hope, try this one on for size!	2005-02-05
US	31304380	RROK32FF0PR51	0345453751	932841635	The Sword of Shannara Trilogy	Books	5	10	11	N	N	The Book that taught me to enjoy reading	I read this book for the first time in 1981 in bed with pneumonia in a small town north of London. I had read LOTR in Jr. High school and found it a good story that was hard to follow but cool. I think that that was the last time I tried to read a book for fun, (and being a lot older now I can read it for fun, but that's not the point) Even though the Ring series was considered cool back then, I'll bet most people who claimed to read it and enjoy it at least that I knew were exagerating. 10 years later, too sick to do anything else a friend lent me his copy of Sword of Shanara. It is not just chance that this book was instantly a best seller, and made fantasy a marketable genre and made \\"big books\\" the norm. This wonderful readable story filled with a readers quest to the metaphor, something that has been oft imitated but seldom duplicated. Since reading this story all those years ago, I try to read a book a week. That's how it starts, with a great story. So if you want to get someone to love books, start here!	2005-02-04

If, like I did, you already had the three books of short fiction contained in this volume it is still a book for you. First of all it is bound up in one beautiful hardback volume, so it looks a lot nicer in your library(not to mention the three have become valuable as collector items, so you can protect them and put them away). But it also has the advantage of some additional insights of the author as well as a story made especially for this edition. Lastly, if you don't have these stories in some other form you are missing a real treat. Ms. Cherryh's multi level writing style is always rewarding, and if you like I do have made an effort to own everything she has written will give you essential, parts of stories that you may have missed, (for example, Faery In Shadow, would be a head scratcher with out reading the first half of the story only available in the short story collections. Hint, Hint Publisher... Why don't you publish that Story in one volume for collectors? This is a great Airport Book, as it short stories and has natural breaks, but also the author, has set the book up as a story teller speaking to a traveler. Excellent!	2005-02-04
US	31304380	R7DEDHW065Z00	015216250X	681141436	So You Want to Be a Wizard: The First Book in the Young Wizards Series	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Much Much Much better than Harry Potter	A recently reread the first three books of this series for at least the third time. I still remeber the first time I read them as a \\"reading vacation\\" looking for something very light, I thought it a YA book, and I guess you can read it that way, at least the first one, but... The underlying metaphor can get very deep, engrossingn and thought provocing. A great story. I thoughouly enjoy these books!	2005-02-04
US	31304380	RG441LFEF6H9G	0812575717	106877023	Ender's Shadow (The Shadow Series)	Books	5	0	1	N	N	My favorite Story	Enders Shadow is actually my favorite story of all time.<br /><br />As a supplement to Enders game it has appeal on several levels.<br /><br />One, it explores the truth that truth is often a matter of viewpoint... That there are many sides to any story, and rarely do we have the advantage of knowing more than one.<br /><br />Secondly it is a great essay into the nature of genius... Often I think that people think that being genius is a happy wonderful thing, when in reality it is a lonely place, being the smartest person in the room usually means you have no one that can understand your perspective.<br /><br />It is also an exploration of the difference of ability and intelligence. For while Bean's character, is clearly the most intelligent, he comes to realize that Ender is clearly the one most fit to lead.<br /><br />It explores what sacrifices we ask of our military, and reminds us to let our children have a childhood. As the beginning of the Shadow series, it is in more action oriented and fast paced linier exploration of a character than the also wonderful Ender series that gets in to deep religious theory and covers millennia.	2005-02-04

And then...<br /><br />You will find yourself thinking about it while you relax, while you try to work, while you try to generate conversations from people concerning thoughts that seemed simple as they were explained in the book only to see confused looks on the faces of your  co-workers family and friends. This is a great story that look into how small things affect the world (I E the butterfly affect). One of the great questions in the story is \\"when did Christopher Columbus decide to be great?\\" and that question is explored in a way to change the way you think about history. This is a great book filled with great ideas.	2005-02-04
US	31304380	R2JMUEHJZ1P4TC	0345372794	940007423	Faery in Shadow	Books	5	7	9	N	Y	Celtic Mythology Wonder	This is a great story based in the ancient UK . Celtic honor, and horror. The secret problem with the book is that it is the second part of a story that is available in Ms Cherryh's collected short stories. If you have enjoyed her ancient Russia stories and The Dreamstone stories, you will enjoy this rare gem.	2005-02-03
US	31304380	RNEDZ6QUXJDCG	0756402530	904710435	Destroyer (Foreigner 7)	Books	5	5	6	N	Y	Another greatly satisfying experience	Any new Cherryh book is cause for celebration, doubly so with a return to the world of the Foreigner series. If you haven't read them all, please do... You will be lost if you start here. The character development is way too good to miss.  A wonderful exploration of politics, self doubt, honor ,loyalty, and justice. Ms. Cherryh is simply the best writer of this kind of book, and my favorite period. Please hurry the next installment!	2005-02-02
