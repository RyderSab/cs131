I think her recent novel - \\"The Girlfriend Curse\\" is one of her best yet.  I completely fell in love with Peg Silver and the story and adventures that she got herself into.  Peg's life as a interior landscape designer is ordered, safe and well ---- just what she wants.  However, the biggest problem she faces is how truly unlucky in love she is.  She can meet men ok - she can date men ok - she can even deal with the break-ups ok - but, the problem is she seems to have a pattern attached to her.  She is the last girlfriend before all the men in her life, go and get married.  And, if that isn't bad enough --- they all say the same thing.  They owe it all to Peg.  Yikes.....    Peg's decision to completely overhaul her life and move from NYC to Vermont is just the first step in a hilarious and delightful book about love, life and a guy named Linus.    Valerie Frankel is a talented writer who knows her own style and what she does best.  I always enjoy her stuff and look forward to the next.    Cheers!	2005-03-27

I have been watching her for years and have each of her (equally) amazing books.  I find her style and way to welcoming and educational. She has NEVER presented something that I haven't been able to make on my own.  Yes - sometimes her ingredients are on the wicked side - but, there is nothing that is keeping you from altering some of the cream and butter steps.  Ina is all about doing what feels and tastes good to you.  She is never pushy or overbearing.   <br /> <br />\\"Barefoot In Paris\\" is her newest venture - and I think one of the strongest in her collection.  I loved all the personal commentaries before each of the sections (To Start / Lunch / Soup & Salad / Dinner / Vegetables / Dessert) and all the wonderful recipes that are like a passport to Paris.   <br /> <br />Some highlights of the book include: <br />Cheese Puffs  <br />Blue Cheese Souffle <br />Eggplant Gratin <br />Mussels in White Wine <br />Lentil Sausage Soup <br />Endive, Pear & Roquefort Salad <br />Chicken w/Fourty Cloves of Garlic <br />Roast Lam with White Beans <br />Salmon with Lentils <br />Moroccan Couscous <br />Brussels Sprouts Lardons <br />Chocolate Orange Mousse <br />Creme Brulee <br /> <br />I also really love her \\"Ingredients you'll want to try\\" section as well as the \\"If You're Going\\" section with amazing tips and places to visit, should I ever get my dream trip to Paris.  But - until that day I can book with Ina and take a mini-vacation with amazing new book. <br /> <br />Congrats to Ina on her new accomplishment! <br /> <br />Cheers!	2004-10-28

She is the ultimate \\"earth-mother\\" that I dream to be (one day).  I love her easy going to manner and lifestyle. Her books are some of the favorite and \\"go-to\\" selections.  This is right up there with \\"Domestic Goddess\\". <br /> <br />Nigella way is not about doing everything perfectly - it's about enjoying amazing food with those that you love surrounding you. <br /> <br />There is nothing more comforting (or enjoyable) to me than a great big, dense, and rich cookbook.  I love them like novel.  I love to savor the words and dialogue.  Nigella never lets me down.  She GETS it!   <br /> <br />Her recipes are universal - not just \\"English\\".  She pushes us all the explore new tastes and palettes.  Her encouragement has made me try new and unexpected ingredients and cultures.   <br /> <br />This new book about cooking for your family whatever the holiday - is an amazing journey book into what makes traditions and brings back all those amazing memories that make you feel comforted. <br /> <br />A few highlights are: <br />- Ultimate Feasts <br />- Partytime <br />- Kitchen Feasts <br />- Wedding Feast <br /> <br />I know I have gone on and on about my adoration for Nigella - but, its completely true.

I am a fan of her show on the \\"Style\\" channel and think that she is a great voice for all young and \\"older\\" women who are still looking for the answers to life... LIKE which fork do you REALLY use for the fish course.   <br /> <br />\\"The Modern Girl's Guide to Life\\" is a wonderful compilation of helpful facts, tips, and general know-how.  I love the structure, tone, and all around helpful nature of this book.  Not to mention the really great way that Ms. Buckingham has of making you feel like you aren't the only one in the world who doesn't really know the best way to ask for a raise - what to wear to the opera - or the basics of buying a home.   <br /> <br />Ms. Buckingham says that you shouldn't be afraid to ask for what you want - and do something you love.... with that said, if you are looking for new people to work for your company Ms. Buckingham - give me call! :) <br /> <br />I love this book - and think that many of my girlfriends will be getting this one for the holidays! <br /> <br />Cheers!	2004-10-28

I was eagerly anticipating the book that would tie me over until some of my very favorite authors published a new book.  With great stories from Jennifer Weiner (Good In Bed / In Her Shoes / Little Earthquakes), Sophie Kinsella (Shopaholic Books/ Can You Keep A Secret?), Lisa Jewell (Thirty Nothing / Friend of the Family), and Anna Maxted (Getting Over It / Running in Heels / Behaving Like Adults / Being Committed) I knew that I wouldn't be disappointed.  And I wasn't.... This collection is a great anytime read that you can pick up and put down without losing your place and the flow of the book.  That's what's so great about short-story collections.  You can read what and how much you want.  <br /> <br />With the proceeds going to charity - this is a great chance to read something amazing and do some good at the same time.  Give it a chance --- you'll be really happy you did. <br /> <br />Cheers!	2004-10-11

Having been so shocked and surprised to see that there was another \\"Shopaholic\\" book being published (in the UK a number of months ago); I asked myself...what's left??  Becky has bought (and sold) every designer shoe, sweater, bag, scarf, etc known to man - she's gotten married to the man of her dreams - escaped from a crazy mother in law - and known the wonders of a family that will love her during any of her crisis.  What is there left to tell..... Well, in age old soap-opera fashion, give the girl a long lost sister.  To be totally honest - this was a stretch for me. I found little be excited about - except the beginning (during the honeymoon - classic Becky). <br /> <br />All in all --- I found the storyline farfetched and pretty unbelievable.  I think this might be a dead horse that needs to be left alone.   <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong ---- I love the Shopaholic books.  Adore them; I just don't want to see them turned into something cheap. <br /> <br />Cheers! <br />	2004-09-29

This Irish-American family drama is told within 3 main voices - and each character is artfully woven into a complete and really impressive book about family, faith and the secrets that families hold.<br />I loved this new book and found the author's talent really exceptional... I loved her tone and character development.  I found myself completely absorbed and not able to put this book down.  I stayed up all night to finish - and I haven't done that in a really long time. <br />This new author has a tremendous talent and I await more of her work --- I would love to see another multi-dimentional family saga, as they are always the books full of the most depth.<br />Cheers!	2004-06-26

I loved how very English this book is - and all the tone and feel of a suburban British tale.  <br />Katie Simpson is a wonderful lead - and holds the entire gang of characters in her hand and drives the story forward with great charm and ease.  I loved the everything about this book and find it a great way to spend an afternoon or LONG plane delay (which is how I got it read). Enjoy!<br />Cheers!	2004-04-15

So, I was really happy to hear that Valerie Frankel had a new book out.  I love her stuff... I find it really funny, charming and romantic.  &quot;The Not So Perfect Man&quot; was a real treat.  The story of these sisters had me rolling on the floor laughing and thrilled to my toes with my Sunday afternoon of reading.  <br />Frieda Schast is a wonderful heroine and I really enjoyed her way.

I mean - who hasn't read at least ONE of the \\"Shopaholic\\" books?  Everyone has... so, we know Kinsella's work.  Her new book \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\" takes us on a new adventure with Emma Corrigan, you feel the same sense of fun, intelligence and spunk as you did with Becky Bloomwood.  <br />Emma truly believes her life is right on track.  She has a (fairly) enjoyable job, good boyfriend, and good friends.  Everything is good.  Settled.  Well - an unexpected good awful flight has her in a tizzy and that's where things begin to go pear-shaped.  Emma uses this opportunity to spill her guts to a very attractive stranger sitting next to her --- of course you (as the reader) know this is no random man and things are going to come back to haunt Miss Emma.  The good thing is - Emma doesn't.  And, that's what makes this book so much fun.  It's light, fun and really fun.  I loved all the work settings and the backstabbing and naughtiness of it.<br />Great new book from one of my favorite author... I thrilled its finally available in the States (I read it ages ago from AmazonUK).  I think those who loved \\"Shopaholic\\" will be happy with this new offering. <br />Cheers!	2004-03-25

I heard about it ages ago - even received emails from the author about it.  I have been patiently waiting for it and I wasn't disappointed. I completely and totally LOVED &quot;The Wife of Reilly&quot; by Jennifer Coburn.  This new addition to the long line of chick lit books hits the mark in so many ways.  I loved the crazy and different story line - the amazing character development - the wonderful tone/vocabulary/and humor.  Ms. Coburn has a wonderful talent for storytelling and I can't wait for more romantic comedy's from her and the chick lit genre is right up her talented alley.<br />Great book to start off the New Year - it's quick and hilarious.  What more could you want?  Highly Recommended.<br />Cheers!	2004-01-04

I must confess - I am a sucker for a great beauty book.  I love learning all the insider tricks - all the resources the professionals use and new and exciting products.  Therefore, it's not unusual for me to pick up a new make-up/hair care/skin care book.  Recently, I saw that Trish McEvoy had released a new make-up book called &quot;The Power of Makeup: Looking your level best at every age.&quot;  I thought --- oh great.  Another beauty book.  It had an intriguing cover - and &quot;pretty pictures&quot; inside.  But once I dove in and really started to read her insights and philosophy on skin care and makeup I realized that this was more than your average &quot;how to do makeup book.&quot;  This book breaks down all the myths and confusion of over all beauty into three simple levels:<br />Level One: Makeup is not a driving passion in your life. You live in casual clothing, and you love the natural, simple look. Trish will help you find the bare necessities you need. <br />Level Two: For you, makeup is a lot like putting on clothes; it's an everyday essential. You wear makeup like a second skin. You feel more comfortable and confident with how you look in makeup than without it. Trish will help you refine your look. <br />Level Three: For you, makeup is a means of expression. You like to play and have fun with it, and you're game to try false eyelashes and other high-impact effects. Trish will show you how to pull out all the stops for your most glamorous look<br />I really loved this book and found a great new resource for my everyday living and beauty regime.  Trish McEvoy makes amazing product and now she has created a great book.  Think I might give this one out to all my friends on their next birthday.<br />Cheers!	2004-01-04

I never miss an episode and find her recipes so easy to work into my everyday cooking.  Ray builds her receipes around the everyday cook - with everyday ingredients - with a normal grocery store down the road and no real &quot;special cooks tools&quot; that other cookbook authors request.  <br />Ray's new book &quot;Get Togethers&quot; broadens her collection of recipes and give so many great ideas for all your entertaining needs.  I love how she organizes her books - and her friendly conversational way of explaining ingredients/techniques.  <br />I have read other complaints that it is not possible to complete her receipes in the stated 30 minutes - but I think if you are organized, focused and have a small bit of cooking knowledge it's completely possible.<br />I love this new book and it's a great addition to anyone's collection.  <br />Cheers!	2004-01-03

It just kept getting moved down and down the pile - as I bought, received, inherited new books.  Then one day - I made it down to the bottom of my &quot;To Read&quot; pile and found this little gem of a book.  &quot;So Many Books, So Little Time&quot; by Sara Nelson could have been written by ME!  Without a doubt - this is the story of my reading life.  I seem to live my life - moving books around my apartment.  Moving books into the &quot;Read Now&quot; - &quot;Read Later&quot; - &quot;Read Only When There Is Nothing Good On TV&quot; piles....  and finding little tiny gems when I least expect it.  So - if you are looking for a great resource of books you may not have read or heard of yet.  I loved this quick and fun book.

Who would have ever imagined begging for money on the internet to get yourself out of credit card debt?  Pretty ingenious.  I must confess --- if I had thought about it first -- this book might be called, &quot;Save Carrie&quot;.  But - I didn't... and now I am still trying to get myself out of debt before I'm 30.<br />While I caution everyone that this is not the ultimate solution - it worked for her.  It's a funny and really clever look at taking responsibility for your own actions and getting yourself out of jam without turning to you parents.  Some may argue that she turned to everyone else --- but it's not like she put a gun to people's heads and said &quot;give me all your money&quot;. People decided to help her -- and more power to them.<br />If there are anymore people out there with the giving spirit - I am more than willing to accept donations. :)<br />Really funny and cautionary tale -- with a new and modern twist!	2003-11-05

Sometimes those thoughts are clouded by self-doubt, poor body image and low self-esteem.  With the help of books like \\"Shapesville\\", maybe children will grow up strong and confident.  This book takes a really important and difficult subject matter and brings it back down to the child's level.<br />Without a doubt --- Shapesville is a tool for discussion and conversation.

She is probably my very favorite author in the whole world.  I have had this book for years (it was published in the UK ages ago) and I think that people are going into this book thinking it's new and will be up to her current standards.  That is not the case.  This is her very first book and only shows moments of her talent and brilliance.  Later books really express how much she had grown and how very talented she really is.<br />That being said --- this book is still really good and right up there with other &quot;Chick Lit&quot; books on the market today.  It holds it's own against those currently being published - but might pale in comparison to her previous offers.   If you go into this as any other chick book - you'll be fine.  Just don't think this is a NEW Jane Green book.  You might be disappointed.<br />Cheers!	2003-10-28

They keep raising the bar - and &quot;Losing It&quot; by Lindsay Faith Rech has raised the standards to new heights.  I completely loved this book.  I found it TRUE, emotional, funny and really dead on.  Perhaps a bit too true --- it hit a little close to home and I think that's why I really enjoyed it.  I knew is was coming from a place of honesty and someone who understands the complex nature of living in America in your 20's/30's and not exactly being a perfect size 4.  There are many women out there who can relate to this story, character and issues.... I think this is a real winner for the RDI line and I look forward to MANY more from this author.

Her previous work has always been on my list of favorite &quot;chick lit&quot; - work such as &quot;Ralph's Party&quot;, &quot;Thirtynothing&quot; and &quot;One-Hit Wonder&quot; are great British imports and each offer a new and amazing quality to Ms. Jewell's collection.  But, with the release of her new work &quot;A Friend of the Family&quot;, she goes beyond her previous talent and moves into the higher talent ranking of Helen Fielding and Marian Keyes.<br />Brothers Tony, Sean and Ned have a great life and love their family.  It's only when a new person walks in and stirs things up that you really see how 3 grown men handle life, love and family.  <br />This refreshing look into the inner workings of brothers is a huge leap forward and something I was thrilled to see.  You don't usually get that man's point of view done very effectively - but Lisa Jewell nailed it.  Perfectly done --- and might be the big deal of this summer.  I loved it and think it's her best work to date.  Can't wait for more!<br />Cheers!	2003-06-22

I love them.  I'm a sucker for a great \\"how to be chic and fabulous\\" book.  I love the graphics, the helpful little tips, the entire gossipy feel of them.<br />\\"Work It, Girl : 101 Tips for the Hip Working Chick\\" by Wendy Burt and Erin Kindberg is a fun and friendly user's guide for those of us either just starting out - or in the middle of that first BIG job.

I really wish someone could explain to me how women get themselves into messes like Jo does in &quot;Guilty Feet&quot; by Kelly Harte?  Because, we do.  We ALL do.  <br />Jo decides to leave her live-in boyfriend, SURE that he'll chase after her and declare his undying love and passion.  Bet you can't guess what happens next? ---------- he doesn't follow ------- Shocker huh?  Well, it only gets better.  Word is, he has another girl on the hook.  I<br /> just don't understand why (supposedly) intelligent women allow themselves to be put into situations like this.  It's frustrating --- but makes for amazing book reading :)  <br />&quot;Guilty Feet&quot; (a new Red Dress Inc book) is a hilarious and very true to life tale of regret and love.  The thought of being &quot;someone else&quot; has appealed to everyone at one time or another -- the question is, can Jo repair the damage she has done.  Or is it too late?  <br />I loved this book and think that Ms. Harte has a knack and talent for the &quot;chick lit&quot; genre.  I look forward to more.<br />Cheers!	2003-06-22

The gorgeous setting of a Hudson River estate is a perfect backdrop for these amazingly different and yet intoxicating group of people that Ms. Clements brings together during the summer.  25 years after college, this reunited group deals with heartbreak, loss and that little thing we call life with humor, sex appeal and a good ole' dose of intrigue.  <br />It's a fun and flirty book that makes for the perfect beach read.

I'm not sure it lives up to that great height --- but it's on the right track.<br />The story of young NYC travel column writer Kate Bogart is a fun and fast journey around the world via email.  This new \\"email\\" format seems to be taking over and I still haven't completely made up my mind about it --- but, in this book it seems to work.  I wonder if it lets an author off the hook and the books  aren't expected to as good as traditional books, but I think it might even be harder to keep a readers attention when they have to work at reading a book in email format.  When it's done right (as in Wanderlust) it's fun and fresh.  When it's done poorly, it's a total failure.  That's why I think the risk is greater.<br />Kate's correspondence with the \\"outside\\" world moves this book along and her travels provide for endless adventures.  It's a wonderfully witty and fresh book from promising new writer.  I would love to see a \\"real\\" book about Kate and her travels ---- my jealousy over her ability to travel alone (scares me to death) is really palpable.  A fast and fun read - perfect for summer months.<br />Cheers!	2003-06-22

From the abandonment of a mother, betrayal of a father, motherhood and lighter mood stories of cheating on her driver's test, Ms. Harrison's work is never boring and always effective.<br />&quot;Seeking Rapture&quot; is a wonderful collection of prose from an exceptionally talented writer who never seems to shy away from the taboo or shocking and, I really admire her for that.	2003-06-10

Which is something I rarely do.  I must confess - I am never disappointed.  Her work is always powerful, insightful, smart, and really mature.  She is not your usual &quot;Chick Lit&quot; novelist.  She is above and beyond that criteria - she is wonderfully powerful.  Her characters, storylines and subjects she covers are for true readers.<br />&quot;Behaving Like Adults&quot; focuses on 29 year old Holly who is struggling with a few areas in her life.  After breaking up with her unfocused boyfriend, she turns to her friends and her business (matchmaking / dating service) for a fresh start.  However, this has drastic and powerful consequences and that's where the heart and soul of this book meet.  It's a wonderful book to really sink your teeth into and I loved every minute of it.

She's your average woman, with a so-so job, a wacky family, great friends and a boyfriend that treats her like dirt.  Basic formula for a cute &quot;chick lit&quot; book.  Right?  Right.  Here's the different ----- &quot;Lucy Talk&quot; is all written in email format/WORD doc. Monologue's.  Some people haven't enjoyed this form of writing (seen in other current books) but I really think it moves a book along and makes it an easy and fun read.<br />I particularly loved the relationship between Lucy and her best girlfriends, Jane and Bella.  I found myself really drawn to them and could see myself in their group.<br />I love Fiona's books - her characters - her stories and her all around creative tone.

True - it's not better than their previous work (that would take a lot) but it's a really nice try.  <br />This childhood love story of Mickey and Fred is really sweet and refreshing.  Mickey and Fred grew up next to each other and experienced all their first together.  They thought nothing would ever bring them apart.  Well ---- cut to 15 years later and they aren't even \\"friends\\" anymore.  Of course - circumstances bring them back together and that's when the fun starts.  This is a warm and charming love story that really lets you into the minds of both main characters, and you have the good fortune to have them written by each member of the opposite sex.  <br />Nice follow-up effort for these two great and talented writers.

Green's previous work (Bookends, Mr. Maybe, and Jemima J) are some of my favorite books and I think Ms. Green is a wonderfully talented storyteller.  I'm really glad to see her moving in a more mature and complex genre.  I think it's time - and I look forward to more of it.<br />As for this newest book, &quot;Babyville&quot; revolves around the lives of three very different women.  Seeming perfect Julia, who is a successful TV producer, career driven Maeve who gets faint with the mention of motherhood and mother in training Samantha, who can't wait to buy those maternity clothes.  Of course, things don't go as they expect (otherwise, why write the book) and it's those twists and turns that make this a great Jane Green experience.<br />I really enjoyed this one --- it gets better with age, and I suggest a couple reads to really appreciate it.

Marian Keyes does it again with \\"Sushi For Beginners\\". This talented Irish author tackles the world of fashion magazines with her new tale, and does it with her usual charm and humor. <br />The backdrop of \\"Colleen\\" magazine is the perfect place to set up the main characters.  First you have Londonite and fashionably dressed Lisa Edwards, who thinks that her life is over when she is shipped off to the great north to be the editor of this new magazine with a the smallest staff known to man, no perks, and well ---- it's in Ireland (which she thinks is a fate worse than death.) <br />The bright spot is the really sweet (sometimes overly sweet) Ashling Kennedy. Ashling is everything that Lisa is not. She's not fashionable, she's not worldly, she's not --- well, posh. But, she's the foundation of this book and really the driving force behind this great tale of work, love and friendships. <br />I don't think there is a better author out there than Marian Keyes and she didn't let me down with this one. I love \\"Sushi for Beginners\\" and would suggest it to any lover of this genre or great fiction in general.<br />Cheers!!!!!!	2003-05-29

Gardner is really smart, funny and romantic work of fiction that is a perfect for a summer day at the beach.  <br />I really enjoyed Samantha, but I have to say that Cedric was the true gem of this book for me.  I really loved him and really rooted for him from the first page of the book.  He was charming sweet and really loving.  I loved everything about this book - and find myself telling anyone and everyone to pick up a copy.  <br />B.D.

Once I picked it up and read the back cover, that did it.  I was sold.  Having medium hopes for it --- it takes a lot to be a GREAT chick lit book these days, but I was completely and happily surprised.  I loved the whole pop culture and 80's flashback side of this book.  It made for a wonderful backdrop to the life and times of Eliza and her fancy for rock star's.

What else??????  Her friends!  (and yoga, of course).<br />While this is certainly in the \\"chick lit\\" genre --- it's better than the usual fair and Ms. Matthews' work is really well crafted and clever.

OK - it's not \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  BUT, I personally don't think \\"The Devil Wears Prada by Lauren Weisberger was supposed to be.  It was meant to be a fun (possibly tongue-in-cheek) portrayal of a young women's entrance into the world of fashion magazine publishing.  Andrea Sachs goes to work for Miranda Priestly, the all-powerful editor of Runway magazine.  And, Ms. Priestly is in a word.  A b*tch.  There's no doubt that this is a stab at author Lauren Weisberger's tenure as assistant to well known Vogue editor Anna Wintour and is very familiar to bestseller \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" but it's unfair to group them together as the same book.  They are differnt and have enough power in themselves to hold their own.<br />I think the previous reviews of \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" were unnecessarily harsh and a bit unfair.

I loved their spirit and strength.<br />&quot;Tall Poppies&quot; is a great book and I loved every minute of it.<br />Cheers!	2003-04-22

I read it years ago and loved page of it.  I'm a huge lover of Jane Austin and all tributes that have come after, including &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot;. &quot;Pride, Prejudice and Jasmin Field : A Novel&quot;<BR>by Melissa Nathan is a wonderfully clever, hilarious, and really entertaining.  I was especially found of Harry Noble's character and couldn't truly believe how obnoxious he really was.  I was beginning to think it must be some sort of dream sequence, but it wasn't.  It really showed Ms. Nathan's talent and I continue to say this is one of my favorite books in the last 5 years.<br />A great read for the summer and I think everyone would approve.<br />Cheers!	2003-04-22

I mean -- come on.  \\"Tom Dick and Debbie Harry\\" - how clever is that?  I give Jessica Adams a big thumbs up on this one.  I loved her previous work - \\"Single White E-Mail\\" and I was really happy to get a copy of this her new book.  This hilarious romp is set within the structure of a wedding and that leads to some smart and sexy scenes.  I found it really original and different.  I haven't read anything else like it - and I have read a LOT of english/australian/american books written by young women.  So, I give it high praise for originality.<br />My only complaint is the sometimes disjointed character development - I wanted more, and found some characters lacking.  Other than that ------- highly recommended.<br />Cheers!	2003-04-22

I'm a huge fan.  Watch it constantly - LOVE the Detroit Red Wings with my entire heart.  So, when I saw that a new contemporary romance novel was coming out - and it revolved around a hockey team.  I was thrilled.  Even bought a copy BRAND new.  Hardly ever do that with romance novels.  Well ------ I was completely let down.  I really didn't like it.  I found the characters boring, not romantic at all, and the entire storyline unfulfilled.  <br />\\"Body Check\\" by Deirdre Martin had potential.  It could have been great.  I give Ms. Martin credit for the interesting foundation - but, she needs work on the sexual tension and dynamic storylines.<br />I wish I could recommend it --- but, sadly I can't.	2003-04-22

This is a saga.  It's big.  Really big.  Not just in pages (544) put in spirit and taste.  It's got everything.  It's full and deep.  I loved the lingering romance and modern sensibility.  It's a wonderful and complex book of struggle and dreams.   Fiona is an incredible character and I admired her tremendously.  Her bold and empowered nature sends her over seas during the 1880s to New York and a completely new life.<br />I loved everything about \\"The Tea Rose\\" by Jennifer Donnelly.

But - this Red Dress Inc. book goes beyond your usual, &quot;I NEED A BOYFRIEND TO MAKE ME HAPPY&quot; genre and into the unlikely friendships between women.  All women - no matter how different they may be.<br />I really enjoyed &quot;Fishbowl&quot; and think it's a great step forward for Ms. Mlynowski (previous work - &quot;Milkrun&quot;).  I loved the dynamics between the 3 female roommates, the adventures they seem to get themselves into and the outside characters they encounter.  Its funny, well written, and thought out.

I was going to say how I was looking forward to next book.   Sadly, there won't be another book.  I was shocked and saddened to read that Ms. Davis was tragically killed (along with her parents) in a plane crash in March 2003.<br />Luckily, we all had the opportunity to read this amazing book before her untimely death. Her characters are well rounded, deep and fully engaged.  Her plot and story is well crafted and really interesting.  I found her work really interesting and couldn't put it down.

Not a great book - but a good one.  Colgan's usual humor and talent (showcased in &quot;Amanda's Wedding&quot;) isn't quite up to regular standards.  But - it's still a nice story with some interesting characters and hints of witty dialogue.<br />Holly - a would be florist is a bit of a sad case.  She doesn't really have a career - no real boyfriend - and no real direction.  But - she does have a good spirit and a few good friends.  When she moves into her friends flat - things begin to look up and her overwhelming attraction to flatmate Addison gives her something to look forward to every day.  BUT - that's only the beginning.  The book takes some clever and interesting turns from there, but all in all, it's not up to level of talent I expect from Jenny Colgan.  She's done better - and I'm sure she will again.<br />Cheers!!	2003-04-07

There was something so intriguing and fascinating about Darien Gilbertson and her husband Robert.  &quot;The Good Patient&quot; by Kristin Waterfield Duisberg is a wonderful case study into the mind of a seriously wounded and troubled woman.  Her dark world of cutting, alcoholism, and promiscuity is hard to read but very evoking.  <br />I found this book to be really intense and powerful, and I really enjoyed it.  It's a desperate tale of pain and really worth your time.	2003-03-31

I'm a huge fan of TLC's \\"Trading Spaces\\". I love the concept (based on the fabulous BBC show \\"Changing Rooms\\") and I love the designers (they really are the ones that make this show a hit) and I love home design. BUT - if you are looking for a HOW TO book. This isn't for you.... this is a fun and gossipy book ABOUT the designers, carpenters and host Paige Davis. If you want HOW TO tips, wait until later this year when THAT book comes out. <br />This book if full of profiles, home pictures, tales and reviews of each of the designers and their most famous rooms. It's a fun look inside their lives and recommendations. It's a marketing person's dream :) It's fluff --- but in a good way. It's a great soft sided book that takes your mind off more serious topics of the day. <br />My favorite spotlights are Hildi (it really shows her softer and sweeter side) and my all time fav. groovy girl Genevieve. She's such a wonderful free spirit. BUT - without a doubt, my crush on Vern's talent is even greater after reading about him in this book.<br />\\"Trading Spaces - Behind The Scenes\\" is just a great pick me up and I enjoyed every minute of it!	2003-03-29

The Red Dress Inc. line of female driven literature has produced the uneven but all in all, clever book by Lynn Messina.  &quot;Fashionistas&quot; is a look inside the world of fashion magazine publishing and the main character of Vig Morgan sets the scene.  The work place is where you find the positives in this book.  I really enjoyed the interoffice banter and interaction.  That's the heart of this story.  I didn't feel a strong connection with any of the outside stories or characters.  <br />The love interest wasn't very interesting at all.  I really didn't care if they got together - and in a way, I keep waiting for another character to show up and be the MAIN male interest.  Never happened.  H<br />owever, I wouldn't say this book is bad ---- just a bit uneven and not the BEST Red Dress Inc. book out there.	2003-03-29

I'll give her a break.<br />\\"Mr. Maybe\\" is without a doubt my favorite book.  I adore it.  I loved everything about it. I love the characters, the story, the settings, everything.  Libby is the ultimate British Gal and I was entranced in her life and fascinated with her fashion, interests and relationship with her best friend.  When lovely and sexy Nick shows up in Libby's posh life - he really throws her for a loop.  This is a girl that loves Prada and fancy restaurant.  Nick loves pubs and is on state's assistance.  They couldn't be more different --- but for some reason, it works.  However, when the relationship falls part, that's when the book really starts.  Libby suffers an identity crisis flounders in a dead-end relationship and continues to crave the romance she experienced with Nick.<br />I loved everything about this book and recommend it to all my friends.  The audio version if also VERY enjoyable.  Great on the subway or a car trip.<br />Hope everyone tries it -- I think you'll love it.<br />Cheers!	2003-03-29

The characters were well developed and really interesting.  Some of the more memorable in recent history.   <br />Ms. Wolff is a very gifted storyteller and I will continue to look for her work.

You root for Becky with both hands clenched tight - and the wait was completely worth it.  Becky got her man - her life - and her happiness.  I, for one, couldn't be happier for her.

It's better than that.  It's really well crafted and well thought out.  I think Ms. Frankel is extremely talented and I continue to be charmed by her work. <br />I loved main character Stacy, and found myself really relating to her and her struggles.

Before you can find the tissues, this woman has lost her entire family (mother/father/brother) in a horrific car-accident and falls into a (not surprising) depression and doesn't want to get out of bed.  Here's the kicker --- it's NOT a sad book.  It has moments of sadness but in the end, it's really a funny and charming book about starting over and the healing value of friendship.<br />I really enjoyed this surprising book and would read more from this talented author.

I found the three main characters (Maggie - the pregnant one on maternity leave / Roxanne - the dating a married man one / Candice - the trusting and will do anything for a person in need one) all well rounded and hilarious.  <br />&quot;Cocktails&quot; goes beyond your basic &quot;friends forever&quot; novel and dives into real life problems and the effects those decisions have on you and those around you.  <br />I found this book really unique and sparkling with touches of really dark and edgy comedy.

Well - \\"Angels\\" let me down.  I think that I have come to expect such wonderful and creative work from Ms. Keyes that anything less than spectacular puts me off.  Maybe I wouldn't have been disappointed with it if another author had written it - but I have much higher standards for Ms. Keyes.  I found \\"Angels\\" lacking direction, her usual sense of humor missing and compassionate characters absent. I couldn't have cared less about Maggie.  I found her very uninteresting, where her sisters (Rachel \\"Rachel's Holiday\\") and (Claire \\"Watermelon\\") completely had me from page one.  <br />I believe that Ms. Keyes can do better and has.  She is one of the brightest stars in the \\"chick lit\\" genre and I will always give her the benefit of the doubt and continue to buy her books - this one just gets resold to my used book seller.	2003-02-06

Sadly, this is a part of history and literature that I am not that familiar with so I was eager to read this and expand my horizons and knowledge base.  WOW!  I was taken back in time to a world that I can hardly imagine.  As a 27 year old white woman living in 2002 I can't even begin to truly understand what it meant to be a black slave in the South.  It is a completely different world and existence that I will never comprehend. The mere fact that she was a self-educated woman who survived to reach freedom should be enough to make this a wonderful work but, it's so much more.  It's the human condition and spirit that takes the reader on an adventure with Ms. Crafts.  I was charmed.<br />I found the Introduction by Mr. Gates particularly informative and was entranced by his ease and clear explanations.  It is truly amazing how he found this unknown jewel.  I am so glad that he did, because it provided me with knowledge that I desperately needed.  Thank you!	2002-11-22

It's all done by email and I think gives it something catchy.  I was a little confused at the beginning (keeping who straight) but I quickly got into a rhythm and it was a very enjoyable story.  <br />With a mix of romance, murder-mystery, chick lit and diary'esque feel to it, I think that Cabot has stumbled into a new genre and I really liked it.  It's not a difficult book - it's not War and Peace, but it's fun!! Very sweet and charming.	2002-11-22

I was a bit hesitant to give into popular opinion and spend money on a hardcover book from an author I wasn't familiar with, but I finally did. WOW - it was worth it.<br />I found this unusual story (told from the perspective of the murdered victim) to be so timely this year with the numerous child murders we have been witness too.  During the entire novel, I kept thinking that all young kidnapped and murdered children in this country are reaching out and trying to tell us what happened to them in those last terrifying hours of their lives.  It broke my heart and I struggled with those emotions long after I finished this book.<br />It's a real testament to the power of love and family and that a child's love is always with you.  It also gives the hope (no matter what your beliefs are) that one day you go on to a better place.  <br />I really enjoyed &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; and think that it's a read that will speak to me for a long time.	2002-10-30

I really wanted to give up on the whole thing --- but thought I needed to give Crusie the benefit of the doubt. Sadly, it never got better and never got sexier.<br />The characters from \\"Temptation\\" meant a lot more to me and I think I was hoping for more from them, and an expanded story from the first offering.

It has a touch of glamour with the parties and dates but all in all - it's the story of a normal young woman struggling to find her path in life.<br />This genre has becoming increasingly popular and this newest addition is a great addition.  Other books in the &quot;Red Dress Ink&quot; series are less then stellar but, this one is a clear winner with a lot of promise.  I found Ms. Papa's style refreshing and a nice quick read.  Other reviews have mentioned the few problems with the editing and grammar - I agree this was a bit distracting at times but all in all a great debut from a promising new author.	2002-08-23

Getting to know the characters, learning the story - appreciating the language and prose.  I was moving right alone and then it just started to get stale.

I loved &quot;Animal Husbandry&quot; and really enjoyed &quot;Dating Big Bird&quot; however, &quot;Her&quot; was a disappointment.  To begin with - it's difficult to enjoy a book when you can't stand - understand and relate with the main character.  She was annoying, crazy and really unsympathetic.  I kept thinking she would get better or the story would unfold and you would understand her motivation.  But - it never did.  <br />Elise (the main character) is engaged to nice and comfortable Donald.  Her ordered and calm life is turned upside down when Donald's former fiance Adrianne comes back into the picture.  I have to say, I enjoyed her character more than another.  She at least gave you something interesting to think about.  I found her entire relationship with Donald completely unbelievable.  There is no way this woman would ever have been with him - but, I will leave that up to you.<br />There were moments that I was interested - but all in all - the negatives outweighed the positives.  Try her other books - they are better.	2002-08-12

Before I really get started with my review - let me preface this by saying - I love Jane Austin.  She's the best - and my ultimate favorite author.  This book is NOT J.A. While it's attempt at Austin style is clear, it's not completely successful.  I think that the author tried to be true to the \\"general\\" aura of Austin but she had to know she could never fully duplicate the brilliance of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  However, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. Because, I did.<br />This book is HUGE. (a nice big read for the beach or plane) And, I drove in head first.  Yes, I must admit --- Colin Firth and all his wet shirt glory had me pinning for more Darcy and Elizabeth.  I wanted more --- and the thought of Colin Firth as Darcy has me pinning for a well --- naughty version.  Well, I got what I wanted.  This novel is pure fantasy.  It's way too sexy, flippant and romance novel to be true Austin. <br />The characters are vaguely the same - but, much more open with their language, subject matter and actions.  If you are looking for a bold and passionate Darcy carrying Elizabeth up the stairs - a la Rhett Butler - you've got yourself a novel, and personally I don't think there is anything wrong with that.  But, if you are a purist and the thought of Elizabeth even showing a shoulder is too much for you - this isn't the book you should read.<br />Luckily, I enjoy that sort of thing from time to time. :)  Happy Reading!!!	2002-08-12

She's such a talented and gifted storyteller.  &quot;Getting Over It&quot; (her first work) is one of my favs and I have been eagerly anticipating her next novel.  I was not disappointed.  The levels and characters in this book are wonderful.  She tells a story with such intelligence, care and thoughtfulness.  I really enjoy her pace and character development.  The story goes deeper than the usual &quot;modern romance&quot; and makes you work harder.  You will completely enjoy this book - and feel satisfied with a job well done.  I highly recommend it.	2001-06-08

I love her tone, characters, sense of romance, and wild bloody fun.  He work is just fabulous.  I find her refreshing and just plain fun.  This work circles around the two stories of Emily and Bella.  Each tales weaves a wild and fun room of love and charm.  Her work is so full of humor and truth.  She has been called teh &quot;Jane Austen&quot; of our time.. now, I think that is impossible, as Jane is the ultimate best, but's she pretty darm close.  Get all of Jilly's books... she very talented.	2001-03-18

Imogen and Prudence is another winner in my book.  Her charcaters are so funny, warm and full or mischief.  I just love them...  I think that the British charm that I have come to love and adore in fiction, hits the mark with these wonderful little gems.

This is certainly my idea of a great weekend.  I found this wonderful tale of young Lisa Diodetto's life a bit too like looking in the mirror.  God Forbid that we both be unmarried and without children at age 25.  Her bold and brash changes serve as a wonderful vehicle for this crafty story.  I read a review that said, &quot;This is Jane Austen in New York at the end of the 20th century&quot;...  how true.  I'm a faithful Austen girl - and I would certainly see glimpses of my &quot;religion&quot;.  It's a great book with loads of charm and humor.  And, a bit naughty too...

You would think this could be classified with the whole &quot;brig jones&quot;..&quot;lucy sullivan&quot; family...  but, you'd be off the mark.

It's a departure from some of the other books of hers that I've read, and I really thought she tackled this story and subject matter with dignity and emotion.

If you're a fan of young, female, wickly funny and romantic authors (esp. our lovely British invasion--Bridget Jones/Come Together/anything by Jane Green, Fiona Walker etc.....

As a young (well...fairly), single, working girl....I find these types of books (By way of the British Invasion) great fun.  I love to escape into a world that never involves my paying off credit cards, the over abundance of dirty dishes under the bed or the fact that there is no one taking out my trash (but myself)  This book is full of wonderful characters, great story, and great charm.

If you want a look into the mind of a man...check out &quot;Come Together&quot; by Josie Lloyd, Emlyn Rees.  You'll find a deeper look into the mysterious world of a guy.

I completely enjoyed Tara and her rough road of love and life.  I was enchanted by her personality and heart.  I think that Marian Keyes is not well known enough in this country and everyone should be talking about her books, just like &quot;Bridget Jones&quot;.  While, I am a huge fan of H.

Katie Brown is a girl that I can really get behind.  I have been a longtime of hers (due to her TV show on Lifetime and following her career as a Native UP. Michigan gal like myself) but her work in the new book &quot;Katie Brown Entertains&quot; really brings her into a new category.  She's such a down to earth, sweet, fun and wonderfully talented woman who can take everyday crafts and turn them into something truly special.  I love her easy approach to life and entertaining.  I found myself caught up in her excitement and I really believe that anyone could take her ideas and turn them into practical formulas for success.  <br />Her book breaks down every dinner party theme you can think of, and shows you every element of it.  From the food, the design concept, and the table setting decorations.  She's so talented and makes it easy for all of us to bring something special to our entertaining.  It's a wonderful new book and a great new resource to have in your corner.  I really loved it!	2000-10-19

I had never been to the BIG APPLE and was really anxious and nervous about my trip.  I didn't know where to stay, where to eat and how to see as much of the city as I could in a very limited amount of time.  And, this book helped me out on all three on those concerns.  I found it to be very well thought out, easy to follow and full of wonderful information.  The lodging section was exceptional and I was able to find a great place to stay (The Wellington Hotel) that was in my price range and location all because of the helpful &quot;Citypack.&quot;  I think that any traveler would find it helpful and should really consider investing the money in a great resource book like this.

He covers all the basis with style, spark and creativity.  I found his style to be very modern (but, not too modern. I.E. silver, and black lacquer) hip and full of spaces that everyone would LOVE.  His work is simple but, still very impressive.  I really think that the &quot;average&quot; person could re-create many of the elements that Lowell introduces.  I found myself really drawn to his color choices, design elements, and creative touch.  It's a great book for someone looking to add a lot of spark and polish to a room.  Great resource!	2000-10-07

There is so many wonderful and creative ideas that are certainly within the reach of the average woman.

It's not really a book that I would be drawn too, but I was so wrong.  It was dramatic, emotional, harsh, and crafty.  I was fascinated by this tale of two people who are wildly drawn to each other.  Their love is dangerous and not healthy.  But, you can't stop reading...just like you can't help but look at a car accident.  It was tumultuous read, and I was absorbed by these people.  Almost obsessively so.  I think that if you're a &quot;real&quot; reader with patience and a knowledge of good literature you'll appreciate what the author was trying to do.  He was successful and I was enchanted.  Wonderful Book!	2000-10-06

But, this one isn't one of the lucky ones.  The setup of a young secretary telling the story of those she works with, could have worked but, IT didn't.  The characters were NOT interesting and I found myself getting annoyed at those little icons the author used to tell what was going on.  I felt like I was reading a children's picture book.

I have come to expect wonderful things from this  amazing author but, this one just didn't do it for me.  Not worth your  time or money.  Try her other works.  You'll be happy there.	2000-09-19

While this isn't a sequel to &quot;Sex and the City&quot;  (which, I might add is WONDERFUL) it has the same tone and demeanor.  These  tales of New York City women and their lives are filled with sex, money,  and well.....being shallow.  Yes, these are the shallowest bunch of people  I have ever read about.  And, I loved it.  It's the perfect way to escape  into a world that very few of us will ever realize or experience.  This hip  and wealthy world of New York celebrity is full of ego's and the people who  &quot;rule the world.&quot;  While this isn't the BEST book I've ever read,  (it's divided into sections with different characters) I found it exciting  and a delightful and naughty treat.  Recommend for the less adventures  readers.  It's not difficult but, fun all the same.	2000-09-09

This book is very deep  and deals with many different voices and generations.  The story of the  Price family's work as missionaries in the Africian/Belgium Congo draws you  in with amazing language, stories and the hardships that these people face.   The book is divided into chapter narratives (by each of the four daughters  and the mother) and the sense of adventure, heartache and even humor leaves  the reader wanting more.  I know the subject matter is extremely dramatic  and sometimes violent, but it was the humor of these young daughters that I  truly loved.  I found myself laughing out loud at Rachel's comments and  dreams for herself.  Her dreams for going home, and what she's missing back  home, cracked me up.  Her shallow nature is refreshing in a way.  You know  you're getting the &quot;real&quot; her, and she's not holding any punches.   All it would take to make her happy is a sweater twin-set.  I truly loved  Ruth Mae's innocence and ability to adapt and change with the surroundings  she was forced to live in.  The twins provided a voice of intelligence and  often, power against their father's over-barring nature.  His blinded  foresight into the future was maddening and you wanted to just shake him  with a force greater than any of these women had.  I found the sisters  relationship's to each other, and with the Congo beautiful to read. I  really loved their individual stories.  A beautiful story is told by all of  them. <br />I was deeply affected by this book and feel in love with these  women.  While I may not have always agreed with them or what they did, I  can understand that they did the best with what they had.  They did what  they could to make it and be happy.  I loved this book.  My only complaint  with it is, that it possibly went on a bit too long.  I found myself  wondering when it was going to end.  I'm not sure that Barbara needed to go  into such detail about what happens to the girls/women once they leave the  Congo.  A shorter and more condensed epilogue would have been a good idea.   <br />     This is not a book for the faint of heart or inexperienced reader.   It's a long and difficult read, but certainly worth the time and money.  I  highly recommend it.	2000-09-07

Her brilliant use of language,  texture, and storytelling lead the reader on a course of discovery.  Each  selection and character is well-rounded and multi dimensional.  She doesn't  cut corners on any story or persona that is expressed.  She can tell a  story like no one else.  She has such a talent for condensing a very  involved story and breaking it down to it's core and making it so powerful  that you want to continue with them for years to come.  You have a real  belief that these characters that Bloom created are so strong, that they  will survive even faced with the sad and difficult circumstances they  faced.  She makes you believe in compassion and ultimate success.  A  wonderful collection and well worth the money.	2000-08-30

When I was first approached by the author herself, about reading her book,  I was intrigued and compelled.  It's not often that an author takes the  first step in the hopes that you might read their book.  So, that was a  great start for me. <br />Second, this book was amazing.  I was shocked by  reaction and strong feelings in regard to character and storyline.  From a  powerfully violent beginning, to a story of redemption, and the hope and  dream of happiness, I found so many wonderful things about this novel.   Main character, Charlotte, is a broken shell of a young women but, grows  and heals with the help of so many around her.  I loved the whole idea of  &quot;The House of Gentle Men.&quot;  It's a wonderfully classic and  cleaver story with a new twist.  Sincerely, this is a great book and I  think a real treat for any serious reader. <br />Thank you, Kathy Hepinstall.   I really loved your book.	2000-08-30

The story of young 15yr. old Tamara Anderson and her very  eclectic family.  Her charm and mature voice lends itself to a wonderfully  paced and articulate book.

And, &quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; is a real triumph.  I was struck by the  series top inside of a really great work of fiction.  <br />Rachel's long and  sometimes difficult journey into sobriety lends itself to a fascinating  backdrop in this book.  The people she meets, her family, and each element  of conflict build new layers into this big and wonderful book.  Keyes  certainly knows how to tell a great story and with characters you'll come  to know and love.  Her talent as a storyteller is something I can't wait to  explore in the future.  She has a real ability to tell a compelling story.   I highly recommend this book.  It's great!	2000-08-19

She's only 17 but, she's very mature, educated in a multitude  of areas and so observant for someone so young.  <br />This debut by Emma  Forrest is very cutting and full of humor.  I loved the celebrity backdrop  and found the main character (Viva) enormously run to read.  It's clear  that they author's early career in pop-culture magazine columns prepared  her for this novel.  The English humor that she brings into this book hits  a wonderful tone and I found myself very charmed.  A fun book with lots of  edge.	2000-08-09

You are forced to read about  them, but very quickly you become fascinated and eventually in love with  them.  For their strengths, their weaknesses and most of all for their  voices.  They carry this novel with grace and charm.  The deep elements of  love and family pull these people together forever.  <br />From an early  tragedy, these woman face many trials but, it's their love for each other  and the ties that bind them that keep the reader intrigued and fascinated  by this book.  Wonderfully written with a great voice.  This author is very  talented and I think it's a shame that more people don't know who she is.	2000-08-09

Cheryl Richardson's &quot;Take Time For Your Life&quot; is a 7-step  coaching book about living a more productive and fulfilling life.  And, who  wouldn't want that??  The entire basis that most people are enormously  busy, stressed and cut off from &quot;real life&quot; is right on, and it  doesn't make you feel like you're on your own.  She recognizes that people  have lives, busy lives but the focus of calming down, taking time,  realizing what's really important and making a real plan for yourself can  really help you be a happier and more fulfilled person.<br />I'm not one for  &quot;mushy&quot; feel-good books, but I certainly could see the merits in  this book.  She has practical ideas, steps and ideas for making your life a  bit better.  Listen, these kinds of books aren't going to  &quot;CHANGE&quot; the world, but they might make you less anxious, worried  and stressed.  And, I certainly think that's a positive thing.

I had heard great things about it, and I genuinely   excited about it.  But, sadly, it didn't live up to what I had hoped.  I  found it melodramatic and down right boring in spots.  I never really knew  what the author was talking about, and in what time frame we (as the  reader) were dealing with.  It was confusing and a bit too choppy for my  taste.

And, boy did I have to work to get it all  done.  It was long and hard, but completely worth the effort.  I loved  every minute of it.  I found Anna's struggle mesmerizing and heartbreaking.  I was filled with so many emotions that I couldn't even sort them all out  until I was finished.  I wept with everything last page and fell in love  with the language, Russian customs, time period, and settings.  I don't  think that this book could have gotten any better.

This was a correct assumption on my part.  What a wonderful  series and an amazing character.  I'm very saddened to know that this book,  &quot;The Remorseful Day&quot; is the last in a long and well done series.   <br />The most brilliant thing about Morse is that in the end he's a normal  man with flaws.  You can certainly find fault with many things he does, but  it's with a certain charm and mystic that makes it all very endearing.  I  find him to be dashing, charming, wise and very gruff.  That may be one of  the things I enjoy most about him.  He's no pushover and certainly not a  man to be taken lightly.  I love everything about him and certainly rank  him right up there with Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple and  all the other famous English Detectives that have wowed and amazed up all.   Comic relief is always added by Seg. Lewis.  (Morse's sidekick)  He seems  to be a bumbling idiot but, so sweet and charming you just love him.   <br />I'm very sad to see Morse go and can only take comfort in the fact that  I can keep these mysteries with me for ages and ages.  A wonderful  conclusion to a spectacular journey.	2000-08-05

And, second,  I found the storyline to be tired and overused.  I don't think that it was  as intense as I had been lead to believe and it certainly didn't hold my  interest or appeal to love of a good novel.  I can't really recommend this  one very much.

It takes a real look into the world of the human condition and  what choices you make can have lasting effects on you and those around you.   It touches on how you can take a deep and long look into yourself and  decide if you are making the most of your life.  The only problem is with  her character development.  She leaves you hanging a bit with some of the  characters and you really crave more interaction and depth.  But, that may  come with more experience.  She certainly has a lot of talent and it's a  fresh and raw voice that has hit the mainstream.  As someone else has  stated, I would be surprised to see this book on Oprah's Book List.

But, it certainly didn't distract from how much I  enjoyed this selection of stories.

I must say, I was very sadden by this poor attempt at humor from two of the funniest people out there.  I'm a huge fan of JG's  but, this was just a weak try at being funny.   You could almost hear them  trying so hard to be smart, full of humor, and a bit on the cutting edge.   They really missed the mark.  I can't even imagine getting threw a chapter  of the print book, at least I had the audio that had mild entertainment  value.  JG's reading was a step above Ben's but, that wasn't enough to make  this book could.  Her over abundant use of her (obviously plentiful)  vocabulary just got on my nerves.  I was really disappointed in this lack  luster tale.  I was all set to love it and have a wonderful time.  Too bad  it was such a let down.  Don't waste your time....I'm sad I did.	2000-07-17

You almost feel like you're reading a poem.  The language and word choice is very special and I found myself very captured by main  character Janey.  The connection between older Janey (the narrator) and  young Janey is very strong and powerful.   It's a wonderful tale of a  dangerous childhood and certainly grips it's reader into Janey's world.   It's full of emotions and feelings that very few people can fully identify  with.   A brilliant first novel.	2000-07-16

You know you shouldn't slow down and look, but you just can't resist. &quot;Exposure&quot; by Kathryn Harrison is just like that.  You  feel so guilty watching, but just can't tear yourself away.  This alluring  but, lurid book about a women's mental unraveling is brilliant and  powerful.   Ann Rogers grew up as the muse for her father's revealing  photographs and when the museum plans on a show of his work, it opens up a  whole world of issues she never knew would happen.  It causes a tremendous  amount of anguish and provocative reactions.   This psychological thriller  is simply fascinating and very worth of your time.  <br />It's not an easy  read.  And, it contains very mature subject matter, but very powerful.	2000-07-15

She's wonderfully poetic and compelling.  I found this book  frank, honest and deeply funny in some areas.   She pulled no punches and  truly drove into her own mind and those who she shared her time with at the  hospital.  It's a tough and powerful novel that is told so honestly that  you want to be so careful with it and be respectful.   Kaysen is a talented  storyteller and very honest.  I really enjoyed this book.	2000-07-15

Edith Wharton is certainly one of the most accomplished authors in American history.  I don't think there is ONE of her books that I don't completely LOVE.  And, &quot;Custom of the Country&quot; is certainly one  for the record books.  Wharton creates a completely new and different novel  in &quot;Custom&quot; than in her previous books.   As in the others, you  may have found yourself really cheering or rooting for the main characters.   You felt affection and fondness for them.  But, in this one could you have  found more fault with Undine?    She's everything a reader should just  loath.  But, for some strange and heartwarming reason, you don't care.  You  move past that and just enjoy this wonderfully written American  Masterpiece.   Wharton's gift for words, story and characterization is  fabulous.  I just love her.  She's one of my top 3 favs.	2000-07-15

This  novel by Ann-Marie MacDonald is sweeping, spell-binding and completely  amazing.  This wonderful story of heritage and family is certainly bold and  deep.  But, don't let the length scare you away.  This book contains  everything a sage should have.  Characters, plot, story, beautiful  language, pace, and a talented writer show that &quot;Fall on Your  Knees&quot; is a book that everyone should read.  <br />Don't get me wrong,  this book isn't a happy story all tied up with ribbons, because it's not.   But, it's because of those drama's and flawed characters that make you  empathize and feel for the people you're reading about.  You'll carry them  with you, long after you've read the last page.

This book certainly had moments of brillance, but they were not strung  together into long enough patches.  This book showed glimpses of humor and  really smart conversation but, there are just too many holes into it to be  great.  If you're looking for the LA version of &quot;Bridget Jones&quot;  you're going to be disappointed.  This is nothing like it.  It certainly  doesn't have that sweet and charming sensability.  &quot;The Cigarette  Girl&quot; has a harsher and more dynamic edge to it.  It's wilder and very  &quot;LA&quot;.   But, that doesn't mean it's not a worthy book, because it  is.  But, just not in the same vain of &quot;BJ.&quot;  Read it for it's  own greatness.  Don't compare to it to something else.	2000-07-09

And, if you do, I'm worried for you.  &quot;A Certain Age: A Novel&quot;  by Tama Janowitz is a scary look into the world of who might possibly be  the most shallow woman on the planet.  Her world revolves around money.  Spending it, making it, being around it.  The backdrop of Manhattan, NY  certainly adds some interest and a whole world of possiblities but, in the  end, don't you really need a main character you can identify with?  At  least on some level?  Well...I can pretty much say, that you won't with  Florence.<br />There are moments of humor in this book.  Hence, the few  extra stars, but all in all....not worth my time.  I was disappointed,  sometimes disgusted, and pretty much let-down by this book.  I hoped for  more.	2000-07-09

Reviewers have said that if it had been published before &quot;Bridget Jones&quot;, it would have given it a real run for it's money.  And, I  agree.  This is a fabulous book by (to me) an unknown author who has so  much potential and talent.  It's a well-rounded, entertaining, heartfelt,  and emotionally accurate novel dealing with the life and love of a main  character that I certainly could identify with.<br />If you're a fan of  &quot;Bridget Jones&quot;..&quot;Love: A User's Guide&quot;...or &quot;Come  Together&quot;, I really think you'll love this book.  I had it on my wish  list for ages and I'm thrilled that I bought it.  It's a great read!	2000-05-22

I have no idea who could really eat any of the receipes, (you'd have to have the EMS standing next to you) but, BOY are they fun to read.  You've never seen anything like them.  The ingredients they use, the meals they  make, the language they use, it's unbelievable.  I've learned so much from  them.  About different types of food, styles, history and uses.  It's a fun  and entertaining book.  I say, GOOD LUCK to you if you really use it as a  manual.  I'll pray for you! :)	2000-05-18

I have tried Martha's receipes time and time again.  I can probably count on ONE hand, the amount of times a receipe has worked.  I don't know what the problem is.  Maybe she leaves something out, or the time/temp. is off.   I'm not sure.  But, anyhow, they just don't work.  <br />However, there is a  bright side to her books (hence, the extra star) they are very entertaining  to read.  You can certainly gain some inspiration and creativity from her  books, but just look for a receipe elsewhere.  <br />Her books are NOT for the  everyday cook.	2000-05-18

It's deep, emotional and most of the characters aren't very enjoyable.  But, some how it all works.  The story of one woman's life has (of course) been  done countless times before, but never like this.  You feel each painful  minute and day for Ellen.  Her trapped life inside that house breaks your  heart.  You just want to run in there and grab her, shake her, and get her  out.  It's amazing to see the sad and downward spirl of one woman's soul.

This book broke my heart and I'm not even a mother yet.  I can't imagine what it would be like if I were.  The most horrifying thing happens.  A child is kidnapped right from under your nose.  What could be more scary?   I can't think of a thing.  This book successfully reveals those emotions.    However, I do have a major problem with it.  I felt very little sympathy  for main character Beth.  She was so cold and had no clue in regards to  what her family needed.  She was so selfish and ended up letting her whole  family down.  Older son Vincent was left to care for himself and baby  sister Carrie.  That poor child not only lost his brother but, he lost his  mother too.  The real story is Vincent and how he deals with the losses in  his life.  <br />&quot;Deep End of the Ocean&quot; has it's redeeming  qualities and is a good read.  The sympathy is just focused on a different  character.  At least for me.	2000-05-05

Having been born and raised in the Detroit, Michigan area, I'm very familiar with Mitch Albom and really love his work.  So, I find it really hard to take some of the previous reviewers who see Mitch as a greedy,  money hungry, person who only got &quot;interested&quot; in Morrie once he  saw him on &quot;Nightline&quot;.   How very UNTRUE.  Mitch is a kind and  generous man who was just living a life, as many of us do.  Work, success  and money drive so many, and the mere fact that he was able to reconect  with his college professor in the last few months of Morrie's life, is a  real testament to Mitch's heart.  This is a wonderful story with so many  lessons in it.  Some may say it's too simple and we all know it, but I  don't see many people living their lives that way now.  The endearing soul  and lessons of Morrie should be first and foremost in so many of our lives,  but sadly it took the face of death for Morrie's voice to awaken them.    This is an amazing book that everyone should take a few hours and read.  It  certainly made me rethink some decisions in my life.  And, I hope that by  doing that, I too, might have made Morrie proud.	2000-04-28

The story of these sisters is timeless and the struggle for independance  while still searching for love, could have been written today.  Jane Austin  was SO ahead of her time.

I adore this book...I read it over and over...if I could have 3 wishes, one would be to thank Jane Austin for her amazing novels..I have read and loved every single one.  2 would be to have a friend like Lizzy Bennett..she is the most admirable heroine I have ever read about..she is strong, smart, funny, and so amazingly loving...My third and most important wish would be to find a man like Mr. Darcy..he is my ideal romantic hero..he sure did make my knees go weak..time and time again.  Everyone should rush out and get this book..if you haven't read it yet..you should be shot...Buy it now!!!!!	1998-02-12
