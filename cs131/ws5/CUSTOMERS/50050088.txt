US	50050088	R1AGVUV9UJ9R8A	1883319250	614495769	Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Solid biography	This is far from an official biography. It has not the endorsement of Linda Lee, and it also lacks interviews with some key member of Bruce's life. Also, the excuse given for the total lack of photos was not convincing at all. <br /> <br />But you will soon forgive the author for these minor flaws, because once you begin to read this book you will not stop it. Bruce Thomas, a bass player with Elvis Costello's band, writes with passion, but without bias. He tries to be objective all the times, including the \\"conspiracy theories\\" surrounding Bruce's death. <br /> <br />This book has a serius side effect: after reading it, you will not watch ever again the movie DRAGON (1993). Although Jason Scott Lee gave a great performance, it is clear that the movie was a total absurd, it's amazing how Linda Lee gave her support to it.	2005-02-28

So, although I agree with most of the points exposed in the book (that are very well researched), my two stars rating is not about the text, but it is due to bad writing style.<br />The book lacks cohesion and a smooth flowing of ideas. It seems a bunch of previous articles put together in a rush. The result is that it´s not an easy reading or logical reading.	2004-06-22

ODESSA FILE is better, DOGS OF WAR is better, DEVIL´s ALTERNATIVE is better. <br />What Forsyth´s book lacks now is that sense of real iminent danger present in his classics. HT anguish of the French detective trying to find the Jackal; the hunt, by Peter Miller, to find Odessa; the Ucranian revolutionary guy in the Devil´s Alternative.<br />Recently, all his books seems rushed, and all the characters are without any dimensional. It seems like every character is a consumate pro&quot;. Everybody does what it is supposed to do and that´s it. No inner feelings. No contradictions. No dillema. The children are &quot;Pro children&quot;, the women are &quot;Pro women&quot;, the killers are &quot;pro killers&quot;... well, you got the point. Also, the famous &quot;journeys across the world&quot; that his characters do, one of FOrsyth´s trademarks, are uninspiring nowadays: rushed, no thriller, no lurking danger, easy.<br />Other than this, comes the absurd rating some reviewers can give. If you give AVENGER five stars, you are simply saying that it is in the same status as DAY OF THE JACKAL, what any reasonable fan know this is not true!<br />AVENGER is a turn-pager, no doubt about that. But it´s not a great book at all, altough much better than some of his last books.	2004-05-06

This outdated and stupid book, written more than forty years ago, continues to sell and spread its blurred vision of &quot;Capitalism RUles It All&quot;. Friedman must be proud. Total capitalism has won. Any miserable governmental initiative related to social welfare is seen like an atrocity that will make stocks to fall..<br />Friedman clearly despises the average, poor human being. He's a basket case, in my opinion (a rich one, selling this junk of a book along the world.) Certainly, if he was younger, he would now  be some kind of CEO intenting to fire another thousand employees to make his stockshare raise their value. Christ, he thinks that even the post mail should be given to private hands!!!<br />This book is outrageous, immoral. It tries to induce the reader that all the plagues are due to government intervention. When it comes to corporate greed, he dismisses this problems simply by saying that the greed from one corporate checks the greed from another. Nevermind about monopoly! It would never last! (h&aacute;, h&aacute;!). This book is comedy, a bad one by the way.	2003-12-21

As I´m a big AC/DC fan (up until the \\"FLICK OF THE SWITCH\\" album), I bought this book.<br />It was a big dissapointment. Of course KERRANG has a lot of tradition in the business of writing about rock and roll, but the book seemed to me just a bucnh of old articles put together to sell a book. No new research. <br />Also, of course, the book is \\"devoted\\" to AC/DC. Anywhere, the writer (or \\"writers\\") are capable of telling some of the truth: Brian Johnson´s voice, nowadays, is totally shot. It´s simply not pleasant anymore to listen to it (I mean, in the albums. Alive, the vibe and the hype will do the job for the band).<br />It does not mention that Angus´ extended solos are ludicrous (the solos INSIDE the songs are majestic). It does not mention the fact that,a long a show, it seems that drummer Phil Rudd, bassist Cliff Williams and Malcolm Young are having no fun at all.<br />Also, it simply does not have the nerve to talk the truth: after Bon Scott´s death, the band entered a never ending decline in terms of creativity, only bypassed by the majestic debut of Brian Johnson, BACK IN BLACK. Even if songs like WHO MADE WHO and HEATSEEKER made it to the charts, and that some album had good material, it was always below par comparing them to Bon´s albums, always.<br />The chapter about Bon Scott´s death is full of wrong information.<br />About Phil Rudd return´s to the band, there´s onnly a brife phrase stating that he came back to the band after \\"a four-year break\\"... Well, Rudd left the band in 1983 and returned in 1995. For me, it means a twelve-year break...<br />There´s also the caption of a photo saying it was taken in Cambridge, 1980. But the photo has drummer SImon Wright on it.... And Simon entered the band in 1983...<br />All in all, this book will add nothing to the serious AC/DC fan, but will at least provide a good frametime for your own research.	2003-04-10

But I bet half of the people that bought the book did not finish it. It's hard reading all the way, because Tolkien was really eager to develop a credible and whole new world to be like a mithology, so he spent pages and pages describing the ground around the characters.<br />Also, justo one question: WHY THOSE RIDICULOUS SONGS???!!<br />Also, it's alittle bit too hard to like characters that eat so much and sleep so much (hobbits)	2003-01-23

I can´t understand the Young Brothers ruthless personality. I love AC/DC. <BR>So, when a writer like CLinton Walker tries \\"heroically\\" to pay a unabiased tribute to Bon Scott, one should expect that the Young clan would give support to his project.<br />No. That didn´t happen. Malcolm, Angus, George, drummer Phil Rudd, Harry Vanda, ex-manager Peter Mensch, well, nobody connected to Alberts Productions accepted to give an interview for this book, which was almost a \\"last chance\\" to homage their fallen comrade. This is even made worse by the fact that Bon´s parents, Chuck and Iza, gave their blessing to the project...<BR>Just intriguing, I assume... The author could not even obtain permission to quote from Bon´s lyrics, what would have certainly made the book still better!!!<BR>As for the book, it´s excellent, altough it quotes so much from Bon´s girlfriends (as explained above, this was the only line of action left to the author).<BR>As for people within the band, the most interesting sources are ex-bassist Mark Evans and ex-manager Michael Browning. Altough sometimes criticizing the band, they (and the author) did it in a very soft manner, with respect and gallantry.<BR>Well, once we don´t have (and probably never will) any kind of oficial biography about AC/DC, we´ve gt to put our hands upon anything released.

Lord interviewed a lot of characters still a live. He prefered not to create dialogues nor try to figure out what was going through peoples minds. But, read a book with one thousand characters and not one of them being special is sometimes hard work. The narrative ( a kind of journalistic style ) is dry, typical of that age.

The book is entirely based on quotes from the bands member on rock magazines, fanzines and MTV interviews. He did a good job  linking this interviews, nothing more than that. He also made a ridiculous  short introduction to rock scenario at the time of Metallicas beginning.  The overall result is a weird kind biography, even knowing that is  unauthorized. He has a good writing style, no doubt about that. But all the  facts are well known (of ourse, theyu were taken from magazines! )	2000-06-02

The only flaw, in my humble opinion, is his emphasis in the forgey of the Zapruder film. I dont buy it. Anyway, even without  taking that in consideration, there are a lot of evidence leading to  conspiracy. Please, take a look at one photo showing Kennedy in a public  speaking moments before the murder. Watch the way Lyndon Johnson is staring  at him.

He writes technically, respecting the victims, not trying to take advantage of the tragedies for his own profit. Its not a book to be read back-to-back (there are 18 well  developed chapters, full of graphics, photos and diagrams and technical  language).

THe book is &quot;cold&quot;, in a  dictionary-like style.

He did a good research about World Globalization, he blamed  old people all around the  world for the crisis in the Welfare State, he gave empty clues for solving  this problems. Anyway, its good to know the real face of Capitalism, as  Marx had predicted a long time ago, but that had been held at bay by the  Welfare State politics post World War II.

From then on, forget the &quot;action&quot; sequences.

Bob Tuck shot down 29 German planes in WW II, in an amazing career that was cut short when he was shot down by flak in January, 28, 1942, and then was made a prisoner of war.
