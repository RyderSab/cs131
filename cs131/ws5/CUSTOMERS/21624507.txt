Since the novel is based on credible icons and traditions including current events, the suspense pulls the reader into a web of realistic mystery.  Those intrigued by conspiracy on a religious level will find the research fascinating and thorough.<br /><br />As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.<br /><br />Overall the novel is outstanding (borderline between 4 and 5 stars) for any fan of the pseudo-realistic literary genre.

The events are true crime, a change from the typical novels I read, keeping more to accounting factual events in the late 1990's than coating the mind with generous descriptions of the environment and people as found in the fantasy or science fiction genre.<br /><br />As a Special Agent in the ATF (Department of the Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms), William Queen becomes involved in an investigation that will consume over 2 years of his life affecting his person in more ways than initially considered.  The internal conflict to identify and relate between criminal and law enforcement will become the toughest battle.  Beginning as an associate and weaving his way into the upper echelons, he befriends those whom will hopefully be brought to justice spanning numerous counts of felonious crimes.  Special Agent Queen embodies a true hero bringing the sacrifices home to us who simply hear a few lines in the news.<br /><br />At times, it is mildly difficult to determine whether the story has become a flashback or current event, chronologically jumps around at times.  As with novels of this nature, events and people are vague for individual protection and might give the reader an impression of a fragmented story.<br /><br />Thank you.	2005-07-27

Falling back to an earlier character, Lestat de Lioncourt tells his tale on his final journey with not the original cast but with newly acquired Tarquin Blackwood and Mona Mayfair.  The literary style has short clipped sentences and not as verbose or beautifully written as in the past.<br /><br />Outside of one particular vampire bloodbath that was very thrilling, the remaining parts uninterested me.  Lestat, initially an engaging character, has become annoying and I do not wish to hear his babbling speech or read his stories anymore he has changed so much.  Of course Lestat falls madly in love once more.  As always, the created vampires are omnipotent, able to use any of the powers of an Elder and do not have the appreciation of one who struggled to survive.<br /><br />The entire Mayfair/Taltos/Vampire theme fusion has pushed the creative envelope giving way to an untrue vampire story.  A nurse in the previous novel has her name spelled differently because apparently Quinn, who interacted with her on a semi-regular basis in that telling, didn't know how it was correctly spelled.  Addressing such a thing was a waste of space and unnecessary.  However the purpose of Stella and Oncle Julien is left unresolved, possibly answered in outside novels but I will not seek the answers elsewhere and end my experiences with this narrative.<br /><br />The author forgoes some of the traditional limitations found in the vampire genre such as the crucifix, holy water, and garlic, creating her own world where images on reflective surfaces are allowed.  The outrageously powerful vampires have telepathy and the eldest can perform telekinesis and spontaneous combustion on the younger vampires, abilities I've not encountered in other works.

As other individuals in the sequence of stories have done, Tarquin Blackwood reveals to Lestat de Lioncourt a peculiar life focusing on his boring human experiences and culminating with passing supernatural events.  Nevertheless, the characters and environments are described splendidly.<br /><br />The author continues to create dull non-vampire novels, selling them as vampire stories (the sole catch because it is told by a vampire) borders on the asinine.  The human characters lack any vampire encounters, providing nothing spectacular to warrant a new volume in the series.  The simple pattern begins with a potentially awesome character or event turning into a long-winded life story and concluding with a small section covering an important life shattering shock.  However the \\"revelation\\" (and its disgusting fallout especially in hindsight) isn't terribly surprising given the author's twisted mind.  Many times the dialog is a quote within quote within quote with the storyteller repeating a person repeating a person making it difficult to follow.<br /><br />Quinn's transformation becomes the most disturbing and revolting process I have endured resulting again in an insanely powerful fledgling comparable with placing a child behind the controls of a nuclear launch system.  The struggle of a weak new vampire was a large attraction with the earlier novels and more than likely will not happen anymore given the current trend.<br /><br />The author forgoes some of the traditional limitations found in the vampire genre such as the crucifix, holy water, and garlic, creating her own world where images on reflective surfaces are allowed.

Akin with prior novels, the author describes the characters and environments marvelously.<br /><br />The Norseman encounters Marius after rising from a frozen grave on a mission.  The excitement soared as I saw an opportunity for Thorne to become a vengeful specter but was dismayed when after a small first section of the book most is written as first person Marius revealing to Thorne his entire story.  Countless times the author plugs Botticelli, an obvious obsession with unnecessary references throughout Marius' life, and again gives lessons in Christian art and history, creating a wearisome story.  The final dozen pages cover Thorne's unclearly motivated mission, a far cry from the anticipations cultured at the beginning.<br /><br />After eight novels, I notice many similarities.  Vampires tell their version of tales already known but more elaborately, they suffer emotionally, they love an art form, they tell a story of a vampire telling a story, they cannot or will not glean thoughts from even the weaker vampires yet regularly reveals their own thoughts, and eventually become exceptionally powerful.  This virtual indestructibility leaves me wondering why wouldn't a vampire over all the millenniums seek dominance over the human population instead of becoming another crying whelp.<br /><br />The author forgoes some of the traditional limitations found in the vampire genre such as the crucifix, holy water, and garlic, creating her own world where images on reflective surfaces are allowed.

David Talbot recounts his Talamasca past with one of its members Merrick Mayfair, a witch whose unsurpassed skills might be able to summon Claudia's spirit for the emotionally troubled Louis de Pointe du Lac.  Similar with other novels, the author describes the characters and environments wonderfully.<br /><br />A vast majority in the book consists of non-vampiric encounters between mostly David and Merrick prior to David's initial meeting by the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt.  Even though the voodoo magic is rather fascinating, many chapters are boring filler, trying to hook the reader into two series by riding the vampire coattail with the fledgling's tale.  Nevertheless the end ties the two worlds together in a disappointing yet intriguing manner.<br /><br />I grow weary of the incessant whining by many characters, hoping for more aggressive and gory vampire-fashion bloodshed.  Lestat makes a cameo appearance in a series he helped build.  I truly hoped Louis would remain as he was after the summoning results and before Lestat's involvement.  As with \\"[[ASIN:0345434803 The Vampire Armand]]\\", Claudia's character (initially very charming) is further butchered by events plus David's not an equally engaging individual as the storyteller Lestat.<br /><br />The author forgoes some of the traditional limitations found in the vampire genre such as the crucifix, holy water, and garlic, creating her own world where images on reflective surfaces are allowed.

Armand narrates his life to fellow vampire David Talbot with splendid descriptions of the characters and the environments and several religious experiences.<br /><br />The only fascinating incident is when Marius descends brutally and horrifically on a group of victims, an encounter that does not occur often and should with the gruesome mystique behind vampires.  Otherwise I was not fond of the book.<br /><br />The first quarter of the book reads as soft-core very young adult (if one considers Armand a child then it's pedophilia) pornography with wanted and unwanted adult relations.  Furthermore, a great amount of time is spent studying the intricacies of religious artwork, especially paintings of Christian significance.  From a reader hoping to find vampire experiences outside of enthrallment with the depth and emotion of the paintings, these repeated details are quite boring.  Claudia's death was a disappointing explanation, quickly thrown together and without emotion unlike when describing religious art for endless pages.  Then there are unlikely mortals who watch a feeding with tearing out a heart or ripping facial flesh without any reaction, which was also seen with the virginal Dora.  I think people of relative clarity would be disgusted or offended by such manners especially without being spellbound.<br /><br />The author forgoes some of the traditional limitations found in the vampire genre such as the crucifix, holy water, and garlic, creating her own world where images on reflective surfaces are allowed.

Lestat recounts an entire account with splendid descriptions of the characters and the environments, on par with all the other narratives.<br /><br />Aside from the lovely language, the plot turns ghastly when the consummately immature vampire receives another outrageous offer from a new creature calling itself Memnoch.  Hoping the foolish Lestat has learned from past mistakes, one is left questioning throughout why Lestat of all individuals encounters these alleged religious experiences ranging from Creation to the Passion to visiting Heaven and Hell that consumes most of the book.  I wonder if a setting outside Lestat would have elicited a greater tale, in other words create a world of characters not using the vampiric vehicle.  Some might be outraged by the implications of a vampire drinking the blood from Christ and his fixation with consuming the female menstruation.<br /><br />[minor spoiler]<br /><br />Allowing Lestat to consume the blood of Christ is either a poor plea by God or a devious lie by Memnoch.  Given the unsaid ramifications it might have on the demon presence residing in the vampire blood if it were truly the blood I believe the incident was a lie.  Otherwise I would have expected him to burst into flames or totally transform psychologically, not have an equal ecstatic experience as normal human consumption and not change dramatically.<br /><br />[end minor spoiler]<br /><br />The ending reveals amazing discoveries and surprises for the mortal and immortal world due to Lestat's naïve nature.  During the story all of the individuals gush an inordinate amount of love and fondness at every person and everything almost to the point of sickening.  Dora's has an unreal affection for Lestat, allowing intolerable and disgusting behavior to exist in her presence.

The characterization and environmental descriptions are very engaging, bringing more depth to known and unknown areas of the series and follows a similar path as encountered before, a post event driven tale.<br /><br />Queen Akasha has arisen from her statuesque state, stirred by Lestat's rock band, and wishes to exert her will while others in the vampire community attempt to determine her ultimate goal for reanimation.  Her powers are tremendous, few can rival her abilities, and Lestat is at the center of all attention.  As opposed to the previous novels in the chronicles where the topic dealt with an individual's battle with maintaining humanity, this is a struggle with destiny and survival as told from a third person view.  Once again, Lestat purely benefits from his relations throughout the novel to the point of outrageousness.  He utterly lacks discipline and no one wishes to enforce any, hence his appeal as a character.<br /><br />I disagree about the author's handling in the creation of the fledgling vampire.  I've felt a person with physical damage from a vehicle accident or scars from surgery would remain after the transformation yet a person ravaged by disease would no longer feel the affects such as pain since the body is dead (as in the case with Gabrielle).  Obviously the author fashioned her own vampire mythos but having broken bones mend and loss of flesh restored to form a flawless body is inconsistent when others have lost body parts and those didn't regenerate.<br /><br />The author forgoes some of the traditional limitations found in the vampire genre such as the crucifix, holy water, and garlic, creating her own world where images on reflective surfaces are allowed and being welcomed into the household has no leverage for the residents.

[no spoilers]	\\"Chainfire\\" is the ninth novel in the \\"Sword of Truth\\" series revisiting a prevalent theme in prior volumes.  The preachy writing has brief moments of interest.  Other than Richard, Kahlan has been entirely erased from history, memory, and prophecy as having ever been alive.  Below is my synopsis of the recurring trials of love involving Kahlan and Richard Rahl in the previous novels.<br /><br />Book 1:  Richard taken by Mord-Sith<br />Book 2:  Richard taken by Sisters of the Light<br />Book 3:  adventuring separately, doubts of love<br />Book 4:  adventuring separately, doubts of love<br />Book 5:  Richard and Kahlan together for first time, try to save pacifist culture<br />Book 6:  Richard taken by Nicci<br />Book 8:  adventuring separately, Richard poisoned by different pacifist culture<br /><br />Throughout the novel, Richard behaves as a selfish lovesick bully, rudely demanding answers, constantly thinks life is meaningless without Kahlan, and contemplates suicide.  A young girl begs him to save her grandfather but Richard refuses because his search for information regarding Kahlan is more important, making the girl assist him while someone else volunteers to separately help her grandfather.  He is a disturbing hypocrite, preaching about living your life how you wish yet demands others help.  Richard forces them to choose his bidding, indirectly removing free will with the threat of violence (not really a choice for the child).  Richard constantly states the evil Imperial Order must be eradicated for wanting to destroy free will but obsesses over Kahlan and leaves others to battle Jagang's forces.  He chooses to deny a leadership role, potentially sacrificing the world, for Kahlan.  As a result, the author failed to create a romantic quest while trying to have her disappearance a mystery amidst a fantasy story.<br /><br />Richard verbally oppresses people, not allowing explanations whereas his remarks must be fully heard.  He even yelled at and disrespected his grandfather.  Furthermore, he doesn't explain essential details nor give details of important events because his time is crucial for lecturing.  The reader encounters pages of unbearably long-winded sermons that slowly illustrate a concept.  The second consecutive chapter of an argument about Kahlan's existence had nonstop speech (hardback - Chapter 14 from bottom page 153 to middle page 156) with 4 short actions (lifting an arm or jabbing finger) and 1 small out of place paragraph describing a character outfit and environment.  Richard preaches the importance of fighting the Imperial Order for freedom in solid dialogue (Chapter 15 from page 165 to middle page 170) with five 2-line comments from a crowd and couple minor actions.  That is a five and a half page mind-numbing speech.  I haven't read every novel let alone every fantasy novel, but that is a staggering lecture.  Constantly a solid page of a repeated speech hammers a Goodkind concept into the readers.  Combined with Nathan, Nicci, Shota, and Zedd speaking the same teaching manner, the lengthy dialogue becomes exceedingly boring and neglects to distinguish the characters as separate individuals.  Characters behave lovesick the same, cannot live or exist without their love and will die without the person, a morbid manner.<br /><br />Richard doesn't fully understand his abilities, casting spontaneous magic.  While Emperor Jagang travels with an entire army, his counterpart Lord Rahl recklessly and unrealistically travels with few companions through enemy territory.  Samuel, the previous owner of the Sword of Truth, is as physically twisted and mentally obsessed as Gollum (an exact clone of a short, dark form with a pallid head, gray skin, bulging yellow eyes like twin lanterns) of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is with a magical item.<br /><br />The writing has degraded through the series.  I no longer collect them in hardback and read the newer books from the library having to forego paying even though time is money.As with many readers, I will see how characters I once greatly enjoyed retire.<br /><br />The book isn't without redeeming qualities.  Nathan and Zedd when not teaching philosophy are engaging individuals.  Nicci has become a much-needed person in the war against the Imperial Order with her expertise.  Even though she is not a war wizard, why not try teaching Richard magical skills.  The final 100 pages raise the rating with creativity in characterization and magical reasoning.<br /><br />Thank you.enjoyed retire.    The book isn't without redeeming qualities.

In his final book, Frank Herbert continues his exceptional writing style with a fine mixture of politics, warfare, and individual introspection.  Sadly, the death of the author for this fascinating series might have abruptly ended the series.<br /><br />I enjoy following a new ghola introduced specifically for this chronicle.  Sheeana has matured quite a bit, taking on the Reverend Mother qualities traditionally expressed in the past.  The Duncan and Murbella relationship has evolved nicely, giving the Bene Gesserit a handle on the Honored Matre.  Reading the view of the Great Honored Matre and the Mother Superior, respective leaders of their schools, gives great insight into the differences and similarities between the two.<br /><br />I get the impression another book was to follow this one since several strong characters weren't utilized to their full potential and questions left unanswered.  Duncan Idaho's regulated actions by the Bene Gesserit fearing he might be a Kwisatz Haderach limit the use of his Weapons Master abilities.  Also Scytale and two mysterious characters in Duncan's visions become a non-factor.  The series has evolved with spice addiction falling into the background, although the sandworm is not as common as millennium past.  No appendixes conclude the novel but still a glossary would have sufficed.  A detailed map of the significant terrains, especially with the climate transformation, would have been useful.<br /><br />I highly recommend the series to any fan of the science fiction genre.<br /><br />Thank you.	2005-02-16

[no spoilers]	\\"Heretics of Dune\\" is the fifth novel in the \\"Dune Chronicles\\" over continuing thousand years after the previous book.  The detailed writing style is superb with a fine mixture of politics, warfare, and individual introspection.  The drastic planetary changes found in the prior novel have returned mostly to the original conditions.  The influence of the Golden Path by Leto II relentlessly affects the universe.<br /><br />The installment contains many engaging characters (largely Atreides descendents), beginning with a new ghola Duncan Idaho.  Improving on the previous Duncan models has continued with some amazing results near the story's end.  Sheeana of Rakis displays fascinating powers over Shaitan in the desert.  The best addition to characters vaguely similar from previous books is the Mentat Bashar Miles Teg.  This brilliant military mind interacts well with Duncan and manages the Bene Gesserit calmly after returning from retirement.  Not as much prescience as seen in the past, which I found relieving.<br /><br />As with the planet formerly known as Arrakis, the series has evolved.  Spice addiction has fallen into the background, although the sandworm is not as common as millennium past.  Brief sexual content finds its way into the chronicles for the first time, I didn't care for specifically but is crucial motivation behind certain events.

The writing style resumes the comprehensive detail of the opening chronicle with its strength in grammar and vocabulary.  The planetary changes initiated during the first novel have drastically altered the landscape, environmental and political.<br /><br />Leto II remains alive, having gone through a metamorphosis since bonding with the sandtrout and evolving into a mostly sandworm creature with little humanity remaining.  Exploiting this form and the myth behind Shai-Hulud, Leto generates a godlike image to enforce his will upon the universe and furthermore has shaped his own breeding program around the Atreides legacy to save mankind.  The Duncan Idaho gholas have remained a link to the former Dune days yet ironically a lot of the Fremen tradition, the strength of the earlier novels, has been lost.<br /><br />The constant conversations with implied meanings between Leto II (a vastly intelligent individual) and others grow irritating, generates a sense of mystery while developing a monotonous repetitive theme.

The writing style returns to the comprehensive detail of the opening chronicle with its strength in grammar and vocabulary.<br /><br />The storyline focuses on Ghanima and Leto II, the twins by Chani and Paul Muad'dib, and Paul's sister Alia, regent after Muad'dib left his empire into the desert as per Fremen tradition due to his blindness.  Having left Arrakis over twelve years ago, the controversial Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica makes an appearance under questionable motives to participate in the twin's development.  The mysterious Preacher addressing the masses against the current political situations creates vast intrigue since no one else would dare oppose the highly religious government abandoned by Paul Muad'dib.  Duncan Idaho participates throughout, adding depth to a character briefly featured in the original and strongly suspected in the second book.  Leto II tackles the prescience talent, undergoing major philosophical dialogue that is meticulous yet a very interesting point of view.<br /><br />Using the Fremen Language generates a sluggish time of reading.  Personally, I would prefer a statement of \\"says in Fremen\\" as opposed to the actual gibberish then the translation.  No appendixes conclude the novel but still a glossary would have sufficed.

The writing, though not as comprehensive as the first novel, still contains strength in grammar and vocabulary.  The story isn't developing a culture and world as much as following select individuals, squandering the original creativity.<br /><br />Unfortunately the Jihad Paul Muad'dib tries to avoid earlier has come to pass, leaving fanatics preaching a twisted faith in his family name.  Yet the prescience of Paul and Alia drive the majority of the story in great detail.  They struggle with the affects of shady junctures in the visions while not fully comprehending every possible path, keeping Muad'dib busy to prevent a more horrible future even as he avoids the schemes of those wanting his genetics.  Interesting opponents and a breakthrough involving an individual from Paul's past makes the book a remarkable read.<br /><br />No appendixes conclude the novel but still a glossary would have sufficed.

The detailed writing style is superb with inventive explanations behind the science fiction physics and the imaginative items plus a fine mixture of politics, warfare, and individual introspection.  The cycle of life on desert planet Arrakis contains well thought out processes from the overall planetary scale to the biological.<br /><br />Aside from fifteen-year-old Paul Atreides, I found one of his mentors Gurney Halleck to be a great character to follow during the story and wish there had been more regarding his background.  The Fremen desert culture has been tempered in the harsh planetary environment, forging a hard society.  The primary attraction to the hostile planet is the spice melange, a poison yet a potent drug to its users and the inhabitants of Arrakis (it even permeates the very air people breathe).  The spices' negative side effects are not completely discussed, leaving me to question whether it is even considered a drug or poison if it doesn't significantly impair a person other than a lifetime addiction to its benefits.<br /><br />At the end of the book, there are excellent appendixes including ecology, religion, and terminology.

It has an interesting storyline involving an assortment of deities supplemented with a variety of creative magical weaponry.<br /><br />The book splits time mostly between Denis and Mark.  I find Mark a charming personality who could have been managed with greater attention while Denis is a new character, left as a complete enigma.  The remaining group of characters who got the series thus far is downgraded to secondary characters.  A subtle revelation regarding the Emperor adds an interesting twist.<br /><br />[minor spoiler]<br /><br />Earlier in the series, Shieldbreaker successfully defended a wielder against an attacking warbeast, slicing off its paws.  In this novel, Vulcan is attacking with Shieldbreaker a group of humans who grapple him unarmed to the ground.  The interesting fact is the Sword passes through the unarmed people in an immaterial state but harms the god.  In the spirit of the fight, I would consider the human hands a choking weapon.  The swarming of unarmed humans to subdue the Sword wielding god compared to the warbeast is a large flaw in the story.<br /><br />[end minor spoiler]<br /><br />Assorted spelling errors, in greater number than the earlier novels, slows down the reading.

The story is rich and extremely thorough to a fault.  Careful explanations of training and military formations command the storyline but when they are not fully utilized throughout the novel the details develop into moderate filler.  Although I enjoy learning the rigors a character experiences from an unskilled novice to a respected veteran, a great number of secondary characters fill the story, enough to be overwhelming.

The even-tempered veteran soldier furthers her experiences outside of Duke Phelan's company, at times preoccupied with her fantasies and other times unrealistically naive to the point of dimwitted.  However, the events that develop her as a person are spellbinding, including some mysterious characters and extremely dangerous encounters.

It is an amazing book filled with creative battles, detailed descriptions, and interesting characters.<br /><br />I am pleased with the outcome of the series.  The unique powers exhibited by the sullanciri are clever.  General Androgans and Kerrigan have impressive displays on the battlefield and in magic respectively.  Some important revelations resolve unanswered incidents from earlier volumes but most loose ends are tied up at the conclusion with a slim possibility of a future generation story.<br /><br />The timing of Qwc, an odd character throughout the series, to be at a particular place with a certain individual damages the free will versus fate discussion.  The Alexia and Crow romance is nice but I feel the bedroom details could be neglected.  The Norrington, whom will challenge Chytrine according to the prophecy, is unusual yet anticlimax compared to other fantasy novel heroes.<br /><br />Characters and countries overwhelmed me by the end of the novel and a glossary would have been worthwhile along with a more detailed map of the significant terrains.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.	2004-06-16

The camaraderie between Resolute and Kedyn's Crow isn't as dominate as in the prior volume but is complimented with a romantic relationship delivering less fighting, which I find slightly disappointing.  Given the audacious origin of General Androgans, he is one of my favorite characters, implementing impressive strategies and tactics.<br /><br />Characters and countries overwhelmed me by the end of the novel and a glossary would have been worthwhile along with a more detailed map of the significant terrains.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre and look forward to reading the final novel.<br /><br />Thank you.	2004-06-09

There is mystery on other individual fates from the prelude novel, hopefully to be resolved in the future novels.  It is curious to note how countries and people change and/or remain the same over the 25-year difference.<br /><br />I found the novel better than the predecessor in all things.  It has imaginative magic and great encounters.  Two youngsters, Kerrigan and Wilburforce, are interesting to follow as they mature with the events unfolding, likewise Alyx with her unusual background.

Such inconsistencies are unforgivable.<br />Overall I believe the story would have been more enjoyable had the author stuck with what worked, Jon-Tom and Mudge.  Any offspring of the great duo does not seem proper when one is a cheap clone of the parent with the equivalent idiosyncrasies.  It is the same brand of humor and problems but different individuals.<br />Other new characters are likable and the object of the quest is very witty.

This book is a pleasant read but not as colorful as the earlier ones in descriptions of the environment and attire of the inhabitants of the world.

When I recognized similarities to Arthurian legends, I became even further frustrated.  However one or two characters kept me reading.  At the end, I sat down and digested what I had finished.<br /><br />There is a lot more to the story than what the book cover offers.  The writing is fairly decent and the author doesn't pull punches with regards to character development, which can be fairly sinister.  I felt I could identify with someone then pages later find myself thinking a decision made was no where near what I would do or hope I would have done.  Other authors might gloss over an indiscretion, but this author delves into the cause and affects to help the reader understand the action had a serious consequence.  The great imagery of some people shattered by deranged acts made me feel as if I had done the damage personally and had to live with the results.<br /><br />I am hoping this will be a foundation for a great second and maybe future books.  I don't think most friends who read the fantasy genre would care for this book, but I'd call it an acquired taste and if you don't mind brutal developments you'll be able to read it.

This is the only volume thus far that has the back cover text available under editorial review, however for the sake of consistency with my previous reviews I'll include it.<br /><br />Back cover of book:<br /><br />The Tyrant Falls...<br /><br />Child of flame and terror, born and bred to violence, Hope Hubris had ruled the solar system's most powerful empire with a fierce, uncompromising passion.  His was a white-hot flame of justice that scarred friend and foe alike.  Yet now he left Jupiter as an exile, his autocratic rule overthrown by the one person he could not oppose.<br /><br />Deposed, disgraced, but forever unbroken, the tyrant's greatest hour was still to come.  For only he could shoulder the burden of humanity's boldest dream; to leave behind the confines of the solar system - and journey outward to the stars...<br /><br />The epic of Hope Hubris comes to a blazing climax!<br /><br />Statesman<br /><br />End back cover of book.<br /><br />Hope Hubris records his memoirs during exile following his tenure as Tyrant of Jupiter.  I enjoyed this volume more than the last, on par with the first and third volumes.  The overall dynamics of the solar system dealing with Hope's political fate and the new direction of his attention drive the story.  Some surprises await the reader to tie up many loose ends; unfortunately some threads are left unsolved.  You can almost sense his advanced age creeping into the writing, sometimes rushed and missing some elements.  I will assume such was on purpose.  Also the science fiction of space travel took an intriguing leap with an introduction to interesting technology.  I found it overall a respectable ending to the Hope Hubris legacy with occasional slow moments.<br /><br />During the reviews of the series, I noticed a volume 6 listed as being available.  I have not had good luck finding a copy at any local bookstore or library but hope to see what that volume entails.  Sadly it is a $25 large paperback and I do not care to pay that price for a simple paperback.<br /><br />Thank you.what that volume entails.

Absolute dictator of the United States of Jupiter, Hope Hubris was destined to become the most hated and feared man of an era, a tyrant charged with countless heinous acts and sexual cruelties.  Yet justice remained his fiercest passion.<br /><br />Now to insure his goals, Hope would assume an alternate identity and become a rebel - the brilliant leader in a revolution dedicated to his own overthrow.

I found the volume to be tough to read through at times given the pace of the prior books.  I was fascinated with the impact of different facets of a government under construction, from picking a competent director to implementing the final policy.  Again he uses his preternatural skills to select those around him to form this government.  Also there is some interesting action with the creative attempts on his life.<br /><br />It became difficult when a formula appeared similar to the previous volumes and I couldn't get inspired as before to read to the next chapter.  Almost as if the basic structure of each volume is the same yet the context is different.  It was the navy, then a political career, and now an entire government.  In addition, I scratch my scalp at some of the usual odd behaviors between him and his female companions.  Decent read though.<br /><br />Thank you.	2004-02-08

Hope Hubris, Jupiter governor, progressive populist, warrior hero, and presidential candidate...a \\"mem-washed\\" tool of the enemy.  And if his captors' plan worked, Hope would destroy his own political career, leaving the fate of his planet in the hands of its corrupt presidential incumbent - Tocsin.<br /><br />But Hope Hubris had a destiny to fulfill.  He had the cunning to discover code words that could reactivate his mind...the strength to resist addiction to their drugs...the power to win the support of his countrymen, and finally the courage to make an agonizing sacrifice that would ensure his planet's future and his own destiny...<br /><br />Tyrant of Jupiter<br /><br />End back cover of book.<br /><br />Hope Hubris chronicles his experiences in the hands of his captors as he attempts to recall his memory.  I found the volume to be very entertaining and similar in approach to the previous volume.  His ability of turning a bad situation into a good outcome and utilizing a person's strength to benefit both he and the person continued to engage me late at night.  As opposed to a tactical combat in a naval battle, the reader is exposed to a popularity combat in a political battle.  The similarities are interesting to experience considering the background of Hope Hubris.<br /><br />My primary complaint (other than the new cover art with an actual steam locomotive in space) is the code words that could reactivate his mind.  I feel a code word being expressed verbally or during a vision would unlock his mind as easily as his version of reading it.  As a reader, think about how many times the last word would be expressed mentally (even after the second to last word if they must be done in order) when you find out the last word.  I distinctly remember a code word being expressed pages before he discovered the word.  An example would be the word \\"tyrant\\".  If someone were reading this review out loud and said the word \\"tyrant\\" from the back cover of the book excerpt above, I should have an unlocking of memory and consequently if during that unlocking the word \\"Mars\\" were expressed and my mind comprehended the word I should have another memory renewed.  The entire code word approach is fascinating but falls short when the code words become commonly expressed outside of his method of reading and do not trigger a restoration.  I do not wish to spoil the book, but hopefully you'll understand my gripe after reading the book.<br /><br />Thank you..

Because he defended his older sister against the violent lusts of a wealthy scion, Hope and his peasant family were forced to flee Callisto, one of the moons of Jupiter.  Pursued by bloodthirsty scions across the airless desert, they barely escaped with their lives.  The illegal space bubble was overcrowded with refugees, all hoping to reach Jupiter for asylum.<br /><br />But the space travelers had not reckoned on the terrible threat of high space - the pirates, barbaric men who rape, rob, and murder, with no thought but to satisfy their bestial appetites.  It will take all Hope's ingenuity to survive, but the atrocities he witnesses will never die.

Some scenes are brutal and troubling and won't be suitable for all readers.  The horrible crimes committed against Hope and his family becomes somewhat repetitive which I'm not fond of, hence a 4 star rating.<br /><br />The early experiences with good and evil people at this age will define his character to become tyrant.

I know society is at times represented in literature and I did notice a trend towards what people would call liberal.  Aside from the strange storyline while is interesting, I was left bare (bad pun reference naked) to my satisfaction.<br /><br />There are times when I feel the preaching of Richard Rahl has been copied and pasted for every character to miss the original speech.  A speech to a couple people is given again when more join the party and again when more join the party.  In this case, I would have preferred a generalization of,<br /><br />\\"While Richard explained how not acknowledging evil is evil to the ignorant band of travelers, Kahlan and company prepared the packs for another days travel.\\"<br /><br />as opposed to having to reread the sermon.  I ended up skimming the preachy sections because I find them out of character from how he was in the first couple books.  He was more engaging and cunning in the early novels.  Granted he reflected quite a bit but currently he seems to want to brainwash the unenlightened to his side.  Yes, he is the leader and leaders speak, but not everyone will agree with a leaders political position and he will serve them all, at least the effective leaders.  He wastes more time arguing than doing what he should be doing, fighting for his life.<br /><br />I am also disappointed in the methods Richard discovers the latest Wizards Rule.  This is no great surprise or spoiler, but there is a Wizards Rule in every book.  Again, Richard miraculously deduces a rule out of thin air, almost verbatim.  I believe I remember Zed teaching Richard in the first book the First Rule but now Richard doesn't need a teacher because he learns them on his own, in the proper sequence, at the appropriate time.<br /><br />[minor spoiler]<br /><br />Zed and Nathan, two of the most learned and powerful wizards around, would have no clue about some of Richards additive/subtractive problems but again Richard deduces out of thin air how he could solve them, one of which are his recurring headaches.  The headache solution explanation was one of the most ludicrous things I ever read.<br /><br />[end minor spoiler]<br /><br />What about the excerpt on the cover of the book, which is the editorial review found excerpt above.  It is in the first couple pages of the book.  I found it to be a good example of the degenerated writing of the series and a sad start to the book.  Short sentences lacking any colorful words.<br /><br />Richard the omnipotent, the omniscient, would be lucky to light a campfire with his magical skill.  This spur of the moment, desperation magic is getting redundant.  At least the relationship between Kahlan and Richard isn't tested to the degree of the previous works.  Good gosh, that story has been done over 5 times.  Kahlan is starting to remind me of the Aes Sedai of the \\"Wheel of Time\\" saga.  All-powerful whiner.  This powerful woman forged in the fires of conflict and tempered with Richard's love is becoming a big pawn and sissy to the war.<br /><br />The primary nemesis of this novel is a great concept.  When I watched \\"Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace\\", Darth Maul (the double edged light sabre wielding enemy) was one bad dude with no character development and an anticlimactic ending.  In Naked Empire, we have one bad dude with no character development who has a lot of potential lost in the mix of preaching.<br /><br />There are some neat things to happen, a few relatively unique events/people worth adding to raise the book rate to 2 stars.

[no spoilers]	This was the first Stephen King book I read 10 years ago.  I'm not a large fan of his works or the horror genre but the premise sounded interesting and inspired me to read it.<br /><br />A compelling book about good versus evil on a social level and a personal level.  Add fate, religion, and a little magic to help compliment the story and you receive a first rate novel.  The writing is superb.  For a novel this large, someone might fear a dragging story however about every chapter connects to the overall story without appearing as filler.  Slow parts are appropriately placed.  If you've travelled throughout the United States, the cities and highways are real with a few exceptions.  Not too gory or graphically violent.  Great characters.  I recommend this for those who enjoy reading thought provoking stories on a higher level.<br /><br />One of the flaws are the few loose ends but I prefer to think of them open to reader conclusion/philosophy.  Another of the flaws are spelling errors and misquotes.  Considering how many different copies and prints have circulated through the years, these errors should be fixed.  But these flaws are minor given the scope of the work and don't really detract much from the book.<br /><br />Someone else may have noted this fact but for me the song \\"Among the Living\\" by Anthrax took a more colorful perspective after reading \\"The Stand\\".  If they would write a song about what this book encompasses, they are well read.  Cool song for a great book.  If you're a fan of heavy metal, listen to the lyrics.<br /><br />Thank you.	2004-01-24

I was apprehensive since I was intrigued with the exploits of Cazaril and Royesse Iselle but after a short time I became fully engaged in the adventures surrounding Ista and the brothers Ferda and Foix and some other new characters.  Ista was a drag in the first book but three years later she's pulled out of her curse induced funk for an interesting journey.<br /><br />Once again, the writing is awesome.  The plot is very interesting and has more not-so-common magical elements.  The story pace is well timed and I found myself saying up later than planned to read more.  Every chapter has a purpose.<br /><br />If you enjoyed \\"The Curse of Chalion\\", I think you'll definitely want to check this one.

[no spoilers]	\\"The Lair of Bones\\" is an entertaining book having well-timed action and story arc changes.  And I've liked the forcible concept.  My big concern is having so many Dedicates and those caring for them.  Issues of agriculture, supply lines, education, armed forces, and politics could be more seriously damaged with the number of Dedicates used throughout especially when they are casualties of war.  An example would be the extremely huge drain on a society considering the number used for Raj Ahten and his Invincibles.  If you take a strong farmer for a strength endowment prior to a battle, now you need to care and feed him and still care for the land.  Substitute the strength example with any of the attributes 1000 fold and you see a crisis develop.<br /><br />I'm not happy with how a metabolism endowment affects the time process.  If I understand correctly, the book starts 7 actual days since the first book although to Prince Gaborn or Raj Ahten it seems longer.  For strategy I think of supply lines, (re)construction, establishing Dedicates, healing of non-endowed people, and (re)tooling instruments of war.  The times affecting these issues are overlooked and could be if the campaigns lasted months but the battles occurred over 7 days.  I feel they weren't properly addressed and leave sections of the action incomplete.<br /><br />I'm picking at details but overall the story was decent.  A nice surprise or two but Baron Waggit is nowhere to be seen (although I have my theories) and he was important in the first 3 books.  Sadly it ends a little fast, as if at a high metabolic rate.  I would have liked the equivalent of an additional book to better articulate some of the above comments.<br /><br />Thank you.	2004-01-21

Considering what I've read in the past, Amazon recommended this book.  I didn't read the reviews per se, but looked at the editorial reviews and star rating and was encouraged to buy it.  And I'm very glad I got it.<br /><br />I found the writing to be wonderful.  Descriptions of the environment and the people placed me in the world.  Not only the primary characters but also those interacting with them were fabulously developed.  Males and females were well represented.  No inane bickering between characters, no head scratching as to why some person did something, but interactions for a reason.  A well thought out story.<br /><br />The books realm of magic is fascinating.  You don't have the typical spell caster tossing \\"balefire\\" or the all-powerful-to-be but knows-nothing-now novice trying to survive with spontaneous magical feats with no logical explanation.  This book has enough magic to satisfy.  I thought there was little magic and few wizards in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" series and I found this comparable.  It is more about the people, more about story, more about strange fate.  Some obvious plot developments but some interesting surprises too.<br /><br />If this sort of writing interests you, check out the first chapter at a library or bookstore.  You might want to get it to find out how the book ends.<br /><br />I'm anxious to see how the world continues.

I originally became interested in this series when I moved and was looking for something to read while I acclimated to a new area which was prior to book 9 coming out in hardback.  I remember reading the first 2 or 3 books in the series and going out to purchase the remaining ones in paperback, enjoying them so much.  As I read further into the series, I found myself grinding my teeth at my haste for buying the latter novels.  A fanatical WoT friend got book 9 the day it came out and I had it a week later to read.  He was excited but I didn't feel happy with it and was glad I didn't purchase it later in paperback.  I never did.  I vowed to use the library for the remaining books.<br /><br />Current history.  This is my first review.  At no time have I been more outraged by an author and fanatical reviewers to start reviewing books, especially this trash.<br /><br />First the author. I do not wish to reiterate other great remarks.  Most of them have used the best lines out there, quite funny.  I enjoy reading them more than the actual book.  I visit here about 1/week for my rip fix.  I agree with what other 2 or less star rating reviews have said.  I don't own the book, so bear with me.  One thing I do remember, there was a minor lord who had about the same name as another character, about a 5 or 6 letter name.  Basically, the 2 [v]owels and the other 3 or 4 [c]onsonants were rearranged between the two names.  A name like [Cvcvc] or something alone those lines.  The series has an overabundance of characters with similar names containing the same letters; combined with the various clothing descriptions the book becomes frustrating.  A better glossary is necessary where a minor character introduced would deserve a mention.  Some of the major names and phrases aren't listed!  I don't want to bother sifting through 9 long books to ultimately find out that this person was the sister to the maid of the general in book whatever and we're expected to remember.  I finally searched the internet using keywords \\"wheel of time\\", \\"glossary\\", and \\"characters\\" to find the answers on a reliable website.<br /><br />Second the fanatical reviewers.  There are a rare few 5 star rating reviewers that have true reviews about this book and this whole book, and nothing but this book.  My review is not about them.  My remarks are about the remaining reviewers, who are about as outrageous as the book.  It doesn't matter if you started reading with the first book in hardback or book 10 in paperback, we at one time are/were fans of Robert Jordan and his world.  We are reviewing this book, book 10 of WoT, \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\".  We are NOT reviewing the next potential book, we are NOT reviewing any prior book, and we are NOT reviewing the overall series.<br /><br />To give CoT 5 stars because book 11 or future books will surely rock is ridiculous.  Are you psychic?  I remember reading something along those lines in the book 9 reviews and book 10 stunk so your ESP is off.  To give CoT 5 stars because the first books were great is not a review of CoT, but of the other book.  Please leave that review with that book and not inaccurately raise the rating of CoT.  To give CoT 5 stars because you love the series but this book wasn't that great is misleading.  That is a contradiction...\\"this book wasn't that good and was slow and repetitive, whatever, but the series is great so I'll give it 5 stars\\"...if you give what you are calling a mediocre book 5 stars, how can you truly express a great book?  Please be honest about what you are reviewing, CoT, NOT the series.  From what I've seen, the lower rating reviews are pretty much honest about what they are reviewing, this book.  And stating the series is in decline is reflecting this book since it was horrible.<br /><br />As I said above, I bought the first 8 in paperback.  Friend and library supplied the last 2.  I will continue to use the library.  Fortuntely, a friend helps me get the book earlywith his connections at the library, and the waiting list was HUGE the last time.
