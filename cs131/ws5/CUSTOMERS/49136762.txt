Instead you get a diary collection of his journey in Europe as an artist.  Though in the book he explains the purpose of his trip is to promote Blankets, and he did go through many interviews and photo shoots.  But in this trip he brings the reader to a mature side of himself, whereas he shows his impression with other artists in Europe.  With his skillful brushworks, Thompson is able to draw out little glimpses of culture and people of his visit.  Overall I recommand this book to anyone that is interest in art or already an artist themselves.  You'll find drawing in a sketchbook everyday is an illustration of your life, just like what Craig Thompson is able to share in this book.	2004-08-05
US	49136762	R3FHKWZTE1U8R2	0811839753	195484469	The Art of Finding Nemo	Books	5	6	7	N	N	A glimpse of the talented artists of Pixar.	This book is similar to the Art of Monsters Inc.  However, this time you get more than just images but you also get small introductions and quotes from the artists/animators.  The book starts off with an introduction from John Lasseter and Andrew Staton, both Disney veteran animator and Pixar founder.  Then the book goes off with a frenzy of incredible concept art, drawings, sketches, character sketches, color definition, and storyboard.  It is amazing of how much effort they put into the film.  Prepare and be dazzled with Ralph Eggleston's pastel storyboards (director of FOR THE BIRDS)!  You also get a full throttle of hilarious character sketches by such famous modern illustrators - Peter DeSeve, John Sohn, etc.  Pages of incredible studies on sea life and color concept for the film.<br />This book is a perfect inspiration for any animator or film/animation student.	2003-06-23

Its got historic facts and stories about his young life to a successful artist in Britain.  The author goes in depth about concepts and theories of how Waterhouse think in terms of painting and storytelling.  It also talks about the other Pre-Raphealists that lived at the same time as Waterhouse; their influence and relationship to him.  What I love about the most is the high quality of the prints.  The book is big in scale and the prints are marvelous in fullfilling the space.  <BR>If you like Waterhouse or Pre-Rapheal artworks this is one book that you won't want to miss.	2003-04-07

For many north american and japanese families, everyone must remember the legendary children book of their young age, &quot;Where the wild things are&quot; by Maurice Sendak.  Well, Sendak didn't just draw and write his own children books.  He did many other things before actually getting to the success he is at now.<BR>The book goes in detail about Sendak's personal life growing up in Brooklyn, New York, from his very early stage of life as a Polish American child to his approach as an artist at teenage age.  The author talks about his influence from his parents and siblings, as well their struggle to survive the recessive economy in America.  The author treats Sendak as an artist, who explores mostly around the writings and illustrations of children.  The book shows many rare prints and drawings of Sendak.  How Sendak plays with art materials and his creativity into both pictorial children books and editorial illustrations.  Near the end of the book it also talks about his plans and drawings for theatre art, especially the opera for &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;.  Something not everyone knew about!  <BR>I would say this is a book for any illustration fan or artist to own.  But don't get it for your kid, it is no children book, it is an artbook mostly aim for adults and collectors.	2003-04-07

That's what I love about it first.  But then this is more of a book explaining the progress and experiences of the film production team.  It has good interviews on great animators like Andreas Deja, Glen Keane, and many more.  It goes in detail of how animators cooperate with their actress/actors, designers, and even business folks (yes, those whom actually owns Disney, ahem.... Peter Schneider).  What really bugs me is the absence of concept art and development sketches.  It appears on several pages of the book, but not enough compare to &quot;The Art of...&quot; books.  This is a great book to get for any Disney or animation fan, but if you want reference and simply....to get inspired by awesome Disney art--you may think otherwise.  Do check it out before you purchase it, but it is a decent book!	2003-03-12

It is full of colorful concept sketches, drawings, color thumbnails, and awesome storyboards.  A really special part of the book is a collection of caricature sketches for the movie by Gerald Scarfe, an ink master of the century!  If you like Hirshfeld, this is like Hirshfeld meets Disney.<BR>There are few pages of storyboard, especially the beautiful color storyboard for the song &quot;Zero to Hero&quot;.  It is a true inspiration for any illustrator or animator.  The character development sketches are really good too, though not as experimenting as the book &quot;Art of Monsters Inc.&quot; (Pete Doctor, John Lasseter).  <BR>Overall, if you are a fan of Disney art, or animator, or even just an animation student like myself.  GET THIS BOOK!  Worth the decent cost.  You wouldn't want to miss it!	2003-03-12

This is my first Disney sketchbook series, and I except nothing from the book (rarely anybody owns one).  This book is more of a character drawing and sketches book, there is hardly any concept art, background design, color test, or development art.  I myself as an animation student personally thinks this is a lovely book to have, but I wouldn't be able to use it for reference or inspiration.  It is more of a collectionable item for Disney and animation fans.  I strongly suggest you check it out before paying the big buck for it.	2003-03-12

I always thought it is a girly book.  Now I read it again with the fantastic illustration of Charles Santore, I know why Disney adopt it into a movie.<br />If you are looking for beautiful modern children illustration works, this is the book you have to get.  Charles Santore brings out the mysterious mood of ocean merfolk, which is something missing from any other little mermaid illustrations I've encountered.<br />The book is a bit pricy but it is worth every penny.  It is a classical novel with the quality of classic art.	2003-01-28

If you like to own some really cool prints of Bugs Bunny, Tweety, or just the old folks from the Warner Bros. Studio, this is the book!  It goes through the history of the animation studio and its founders.  Chuck Jones is similar to Walt Disney, he had his own crew of animation masters to create a whole new perspective of cartoon.  <BR>One disappointing about this book is that its published date is 1997.  Sadly &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; (released 1999) and &quot;Cats Don't Dance&quot; (1997) did not make it to the book; two of the most successful WB animated feature film.  However, it is still a book to own and look for inspiration.	2003-01-15

I've read the story/play before getting this book, and I must say the digital images really elaborates a new wave of magic.  The digital imaging photographs are great in company with the writing.  The colors are fantastic and the typography really promotes the tension of the plotline.  For any illustration or fine art student this is one book you must have for reference.  It is like taking Disney's Peter Pan into live action, except with lesser background scenes.	2002-12-25

What's surprising is that in this book there is hardly any screenshots or CG graphic art.  But that's what makes the book great!  It really proves that computer does not dominate in the animation industry; everything is still from sketches and traditional works.  The book filled with great works from Eggleton (director of &quot;For the Bird&quot;) and many other amazing script illustrators.  The only thing that is disappointing is that most of the images are already available in the Monsters Inc. DVD.  Overall, no animator should miss this book!  Don't want to miss those amazing prints!	2002-12-01

For the first and second series of the Earthsea, you'll find in this book suddenly Sparrowhawk, the famous Earthsea wizard, is not the protagonist.  The main character has pass down to his accompany, a prince, that aids the wizard's voyage in the sea.  The islands of Earthsea is losing balance and magic powers from every continent.  Wizards are losing their Name and power, dragons are dying, and even Roke (Wizard school) is dying out its faith among their Names.  Sparrowhawk begins a journey to seek the origin of the illness.  <br />Overall, I think this book is much more intense and overwhelming than the last book (Tombs of Atuan).  Everything is a mystery in the Earthsea, and characters have changed from the last two books.  The mage himself is becoming old and tiresome, but he is still  able to restore the balance to Earthsea.  If you are a Earthsea fan, remember to read this book!  You won't regret it!	2002-07-30

The story is quite basic: about a young girl just moved into this new big house with her parent. She likes to explore and found a door way to another dimension. A world that looks exactly like ours, except... everything else is strange and different. She struggles to escape and rescue her parents from her other mother of the other world. Of course, the ending is happy and she learns that her life is not so boring.<br />Before I read the book I thought it is going to be scary and frightening or even creepy like Lemony Snicket's \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\", but turns out the illustrations of McKean is really what keeps up the scariness. From the book I expected scary subjects and gruesome imageries...but I doubt some talking mice and walking hand is going to scare any nine-year-old. I feel that Neil Gaiman is putting too much limit in his creativity. As if he is too afraid to make the story too scary or too \\"not scary\\". <br />Overall, I think the book is scary or frightening  due to McKean's illustration. So don't be afraid to read this book to your kids or students. It is a short story for a biweekly read, and the plotline is interesting... but don't expect anything in the book to get you goosebump.	2002-07-30

The story takes place after few more adventures of the mage, Sparrowhawk, who is already known as the greatest wizard and only Dragonlord of all Earthsea. He travels to the north east and enter the scared realm of the Tombs of Atuan, where the Darkness lies and workshipped by the people. Sparrowhawk plans to steal the greatest treasure hidden in the tombs, however, a young priestess called Arha hesistates to stop him... and kill him.<BR>Overall the story is well written and a great ending as the first book of Earthsea, but it is not as exciting and thrilling... Due to the many chapters of long descriptions of the sacred rituals and temples. Everything is very slow until the mage enters the story. But it is still worth reading and complete the Earthsea Trilogy.	2002-07-18

Me and my friend got this Actionscript book for a summer read.  What can I say?  It is perfect! Though it is not a actionscript &quot;bible&quot; but it goes in depth about actionscripting and debugging.  It teaches you to work with actionscript like C++ or PHP.  Unlike most books gives you pretty pictures and not much of explanations on what's going on.  If you are a programmer or designer who just want to know what's behind the Flash magic, check out this book!  It is all you need, and you won't have to buy another one.  What's even better is that once you learn the language of Actionscript you won't have to worry about actionscripting in the MX family, there aren't much differences!  It is like once you learn how to ride the bike, you won't forget it.	2002-07-16

Every page is full of excellent descriptions and backgrounds of his work and life. Not to forget the colourful pages of Sargent's painting and drawings. However, if you want a complete book or at least a heavy packed bible about Sargent and his works, well, this book wouldn't satisfy you much.

Some paintings are revised in photography, so you don't get the same old yellowish rusty image from the 1970s reference.  <BR>If you simply is a Norman Rockwell fan or know someone who is a painter... I would say this book is the best there is.  it contains a section of sketches - portraits, painting sketch, brainstorm ideas...etc.  And the chapters are separated according to his years of career, from the early 1920s to the late 1960s...	2002-07-15

This is where Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy (The Pevensies) together again, entering the world of Narnia.  The story takes place after a year of their first Narnia encounter.  They were called back to Narnia due to the disasters in the land.  Where the name of Aslan has forgotten, and the Narnia crown is in the wrong hand.  The Pevensies helps Prince Caspian and the forest creatures to fight against the army of Telmarine, and... I don't want to spoil anymore of the story.  Overall the ending is excellent and every chapter of the book is breathtaking.<br />I read this book during my last week of finals in University, and it did goods to be or else I could've die from studying and working.  If you've read the previous books of Narnia, don't stop until you get to the Prince Caspian, of course, dont' even stop there!!  Never stop reading the Chronicle of Narnia, it is a classic wonder in every reader's heart.	2002-07-14

Wouldn't you want to know what happened after the prince kisses the sleeping beauty from her slumber? Is it just happily ever after? Or there is more to it?<BR>Orson Scott Card did a distortion to the famous folk tale of Sleeping Beauty. The story is thrilling and action packed! Card brings our high-tech world into the past where witches lived and religion is the control of one nation. The story is based on the protagonist, the prince, or so an University student graduate who just happens to be the victim of the folk tale.  Card brings two worlds in comparison, magic vs technology, differences in value, culture, standard, and through all this we are able to see the development of each characters.  It brings you a surprising ending!<BR>Again, don't let the book cover fool you, it is not a romantic story about a prince saving the slumbering princess. It is nothing compare to Disney's Sleeping Beauty.  Read the book! It is as good as the Enders Series!  No doubt the sequel (if there will be any) will be as good as Enchantment.	2002-07-14

Let's put Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter aside and look at the Earthsea series; it is a superb read without a second doubt of the intense story plotline. Every chapter of the story captures my eye, it makes my reading time all too much shorter.<BR>The story tells of a legendary wizard called Sparrowhawk (real named Ged) in the world of Earthsea. At young age, Sparrowhawk discovers his talent in magic and wizardry, after one victory of protecting his village from the enemy. He was taken away by a wizard to learn the art of magic. However, due to his pride and ambition, a curse was brought to him by his pride. He goes on an adventure of travelling throughout the Earthsea; to search for the cure or answer to his curse. <BR>The writing style is descriptive, and Le Guin really catches the character's personality. After this first book you'll want to read the rest of the series. I strongly recommand it to anyone at any age, even though you are never a fantasy fan. This book may open your eyes to a whole new different view!	2002-07-14

As any animation student or fan would know, this IS the book he or she would admires and stares for hours.  \\"The Illusion of Life\\" is not just a history book about the Disney studio, but it goes beyond the history and concept; it goes in deep into storytelling, character animation, background design, concept/script illustration, character design, and many more.  The greatest thing about this book is the author and writer, FRANK THOMAS and OLLIE JOHNSTON!!!  Two of the veteran and master of Disney animation.  They have been working with Disney since Sleeping Beauty and Peter Pan... the 40s and 50s!  The writing is also very descriptive and easy to understand.  Not only they get to the point, they also reveal several secrets and tricks in animation.  <br />I strongly suggest every animation fan and animator to get this book. It is expensive, but not rare to get.  It is one of a kind!  And do get it before it runs out of print!	2002-07-04

Many people may disagree with me, but I think this book is not suitable for children.  The images are taunting and very nicely rendered, however, there are some strong hidden meanings within them.  Such as the imagery of soldier and violent, and especially the general's black leather glove (maybe symbolic to the idea of totalism?).  <BR>What interest me the most is the climax of the story; when the boy and his family falls into sleep, and they wake up when peace finally arrives to the country.  I want to know why that symbolizes in the story, what is the author trying to describe or proof to the reader?  <BR>I think this is a book quite dangerous for parents to read for their kids at bedtime, unless you go further in describing them the history and cross-meanings of the book--perhaps that is complete package of the book, and what the author want every parent or teacher to do.	2002-07-04

I would say this book is unique and outstanding of the Narnia and The Lord of the Rings series.  It is not comparable to any other books I've read.  The Disney motion picture version of the book does not give away anything.  I have the DVD and I find every detail of the plot is surprising.  It is a great read for both children and the adults.

It is just as fun reading \\"Matilda\\" and \\"The Witches\\". The language is easy to read, lots of photographs took by Roald Dahl himself, and the ending is satisfying.<br />The story is about Roald Dahl's first career in Africa (Sudan) working for the Shell Oil company. When the second world war broke up he joined the royal airforce throughout middle east and the coast of Greece.<br />Throughout the book you follow a period of his life, experiencing both the positives and negatives of his adventure.  You also get to find out how he begins to build ideas, and these ideas become great children books that are unforgettable to this day.<br />This is not just a great read for the Roald Dahl fans, but everyone who loves for adventures and wild creativities.

Believe me, if you live 6 blocks away from the World Trade Center and can't get back to your apartment for 14 days, you wouldn't like to get any more depress than that.<br />A surprising news is that an Animation Studio in Japan called &quot;Studio Ghibli&quot; (the same studio that made Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, and Kiki's Delivery Service), they have got the right from Diana W. Jones to make an animated motion picture adoption of the novel.  Something there to get you reading!	2002-01-22
US	49136762	RS7LYYZKJBAOK	3822885746	2716489	Mucha	Books	3	11	15	N	N	Good for coffee table, alright for collector.	This is a small collection of Alphons Mucha's work.  It includes lovely prints of Mucha's poster design and painting, a small biography, however, what disappoints me the most is the small dedication to his major work &quot;The Slav Epic&quot; and jewerly design.  This is a good gift to introduce someone to Alphonse Mucha, but if you are a collector or fan of Mucha this is not the right book for you.	2002-01-22
