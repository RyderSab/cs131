Recipes range from antipasti to desserts, and include basics such as chicken and meat broth, homemade pasta and gnocchi, and pizza dough. Some recipes are a bit involved, but they don't require difficult techniques or equipment (Caggiano always instructs us to run tomatoes through a food mill to remove seeds, but I ignore this). My favorites include Fried Veal Meatballs, Risotto with Smoked Mozzarella, and Frozen Zabaglione.    This is a nice big hardcover, but no pictures.	2005-03-06

Books	4	10	10	N	N	good miniatures book	This is OOP, but is really just the &#34;...with White&#34; and &#34;...with Black&#34; books in one. There are more than 200 games, but they are embedded with many variations, some of them complete miniatures of their own. This increases the value of the book as an opening reference. Although the book is hardly exhaustive or current, a certain level of player (&#60;1500) could use it as a guide to openings.  <br /> <br />The complete games also serve as a lesson in attacking chess, sort of like 'Art of Attack' or 'Art of the Checkmate' (although WQaC is not organized by attacking theme). In addition, by covering up the moves, you can use this book for tactical exercises. There aren't as many problems as in a typical exercise book, but the fact that they appear in the context of full games rather than isolated positions makes them more valuable.	2004-10-27

The TOC and index look identical except for spellings (flavor vs. flavour, and so on). I'm guessing Iced Cool doesn't refer to double cream or caster sugar, but I can't say whether it includes the recipe for Gooseberry and Clotted Cream Ice Cream. <br /> <br />As ice cream books go, this one is more of a how-to guide than a recipe dump. Lewis spends many pages on equipment, ingredients and basic procedures. She's a particular aficionada for presentation, and each page is enhanced with about 3 or 4 photographs.  <br /> <br />The 50 or so recipes mostly cover the basics. Still, there are some unusual recipes, such as Rhubarb Ginger Ice Cream and Dondurma Kaymalki (!). Lewis has a few interesting ideas: She likes to add cream late to avoid greasy/buttery texture. To the dismay of purists, she recommends corn starch when working with egg yolks. Her berry ice creams have no eggs or milk, and cream is only added after the puree has been churned for 10-15 minutes. Conveniently for those who lack an ice cream machine, she provides instruction for finishing every recipe by hand utilizing whipped cream. <br />	2004-09-16

The sections are further divided by ingredients, so you get three cauliflower recipes in a row, and, later, two with scallops, and so on. I'm personally appreciative of the number of bean/legume recipes (10), and there are several good ideas for pesto and lasgane sprinkled throughout.     The recipes range from very easy to mildly challenging, but the authors do not cut corners with ingredients. There's no garlic powder or canned crushed tomatoes here (canned peeled are okay). The illustrations by Miriam Dougens are nice, but I always prefer photos. This book will not lie open and flat on its own.    EDIT: also, there's no index.	2004-09-03

I think even the reviewers who have gone out of their way to say this isn't a book for beginners are underestimating the difficulty level of it. I'm rated in the 1500s USCF and still maybe should have waited until I added another 100 points before tackling it. And this wasn't the first strategy book I read. In comparison, I'd rate it as one healthy step more advanced than either Lessons of a Chess Coach or The Amateur's Mind.<br />Not that it's impossible to understand what the author is talking about; it's just that you may not be able to make use of it yet. Stean offers some easily digestible information, such as the relationship between half-open files and the minority attack, and the importance of entry points on open files. But to a weakie, his in-game examples of strategy will seem to be undercut by (a) not-so-easy-to-see tactical shots, and (b) mid-stream shifts in strategy. Stean also doesn't always carry to the games to the point where it's easy to see the win in hand. This isn't really a criticism of Stean - that's just the way chess is - but it does make the book challenging for patzers.	2004-06-02

And it is. The puzzles are pretty challenging, and it definitely helps if you play chess. You tend to notice positional abnormalities that are the bases of the problems. From there, it's just detective work.<br />But the real treat to this book is the world the author creates. Smullyan's characters can't play chess for nuts. You should see the bizarre positions they come up with - it's as though they're making random moves. Yet this doesn't diminish their love of the game one bit. They're such gentlemen too. No one minds when Dr. Holmes interrupts to ask questions. His new friends are always polite and like nothing more than a good demostration of deductive reasoning.

I personally would've loved to see some detailed annotaion about the song structure, instruments, melodic development, etc. <br />In fact, Sutro is mostly interested in names. He spends only about 5-10 pages on what constitutes jazz: swing, improv, and so on. This is what I wanted more of. I want to listen to a piece of music and have someone whisper in my ear &quot;notice the synocpated the beat here.&quot; I also would like a clearer description of the differences between historical periods.

A less patient coach surely would have hanged himself. It's almost as though we all have coaxial cables connecting our minds to our chess hands, and for patzers (and I'm one of them) the connectors often jiggle loose. Chess is a complicated game. Sometimes you just think yourself around in circles and make a move that has nothing to do with anything. Silman seems flummoxed when this happens. It's a patzer thing - he wouldn't understand.<br />After reading this book, I felt for the first time that I was beginning to actually play chess, rather than just push pieces around. Silman covers the key topics and shows you strategy in action. He also makes a convincing argument that tactics aren't the only thing that matter, and challenges lower level players to learn advanced ideas.<br />But it's also true that this book is as much *about* amateurs as it is *for* amateurs. With all of its examples from patzer play, it reads at times like a dissertation on amateur chess rather than an instructional manual. Overall, I would have preferred more examples from master play, rather than the same position misplayed by a class player one more time.	2002-11-04

The former World Champion doesn't annotate every single move, but that was always a gimmick anyway (how many times do you need to see 1-PK4 explained?).<br />Euwe includes more &quot;dogs&quot; than Chernev (such as a game featuring the patzer's opening), but it would be wrong to think his book is simpler than Chernev's. In fact, I was surpirsed at how many  variations Euwe shows, including some fairly long ones. His selected games are a bit more tactical, while Chernev seems more concerned with principles and &quot;rules&quot; and is a bit more dogmatic. Admittedly, it's hard not to be somewhat dogmatic and simplistic when writing a book for lower level players, but Chernev is perhaps too much of a noodge for my taste.	2002-05-21

Also, the chapter called &quot;Planning a Win in the Middlegame&quot; has nothing to do with planning. In it, he has a brief section called Attacking Without Knights in which he simply shows two short tactical combinations that don't involve knights. No attempt is made to provide any prinicples about attacking without knights. It's the sign of an author who apparently doesn't understand the difference between instruction and description. <br />Maybe four stars is too generous. This is not, IMHO, an &quot;essential&quot; chess book.	2002-03-18

It's a riveting read, but my first thought was &quot;no way is this true,&quot; and I'm pleased to find others questioning it as well. (Of course, many people will believe anything.) Does it matter? Yes. The first part of the book, about growing up in Hell's Kitchen, still holds up. The second part, about sexual abuse in a juvenile prison, is probably exagerrated.

Many of the problems are forced mates, which makes them a bit easier, but they still get to be pretty challenging. I think this book is ideal for players rated 1200-1500 or so.    It's not as good a value as Reinfeld's 1001 books, but it's still a good value. The only downsides are the typical Pandolfinian cover hype (\\"Invaluable for practicing traps and winning opening moves\\") and occasional errors. But it's still a good book.    EDIT 2/08: Looking back years later, I think it's fair to say that Pandolfini wrote this book with a pre-9/11 mindset.

This is book is written at a fairly basic level. He explains a lot of basic chess terms, such as open files and pinned pieces. All told, the book is interesting for those who want a record of the event, but it's not really instructive. It's also not a great value with only 6 games, though it does provide the game scores (no annotation) of the first match which K. won.<br />Pandolfini makes some questionable comments - such as calling K. the &quot;last human world champion&quot; - and isn't afraid to express his opinion. He thinks that Kasparov would have won if he'd only played his own game instead of trying to get cute with anti-computer moves.<br />There's no behind-the-scenes repoortage, nor much here about the technology behind Deep Blue. I think Panda might have written it on his couch from reading the games scores in the newspaper.	2001-05-16

It's not as simplistic as you might think. The only real concession Walker makes to juniors is in introducing a few characters with silly names, such as Mr. Woodpusher, Bobby Blunder, and Count Alberic O'Kelly de Galway.<br />The first two sections explain the principles of development, space, and controlling the center. Walker uses full games to illustrate his points. I have to admit, I've never been a fan of this method because it seems to imply that sound opening moves automatically lead to checkmate by move 30, which is an oversimplification. Still, these sections nicely (re-)enforce the basic principles of opening play.<br />In the next section, Walker surveys the openings by showing the main lines of about 25-30 different openings. The lines go about 10-15 moves deep, but probably do not include enough explanation for you to actually play them without other sources.<br />In the final section, Walker provides a full repertoire to use as White (Giuoco Piano) and as Black vs. e4, d4, c4 and Nf3. Here he shows you more than just the main line. I think any player below Class C can probably use this repertoire in actual play. I know people will complain that he doesn't give you enough options as to what to play, but I think you pay the price if you want a book that shows you detail on every opening.<br />I'd recommend this book as a first opening chess book and perhaps the only opening text you'll need until you reach at least 1400, provided you utilize Walker's repertoire advice.	2001-03-31

It's a pretty funny and irreverent book at times, but most importantly, its opinionated. Walsh inspires the reader to form his own opinions as to what they like and don't like.

The title makes them sound they're for beginners, but I think they fall midway between Seirawan's Openings and books like NCO and MCO, and may lean more towards the latter. MBCO is more thorough than Seirawan and just as recent, but has less text and theory. On the other hand, Kallai explains some moves and traps which would be obvious to the expert, and also gives tips on how to play the middlegame. There are no complete games given, just openings.<br /><br />There's a good deal of information here for a short book. But a price is paid in terms of layout: there are no neat tables as in NCO. Also, I personally dislike the notation, which is figurine algebraic.<br /><br />This book fills a niche as a pre-NCO/MCO openings reference guide, but is it a big enough niche to justify $40 (you'll need both volumes)? Maybe you're better off buying MCO if you need a thorough reference book (not everyone does), or going elsehwere if you really need to learn how to play openings. I like Kallai's two books, but am not convinced I should have bought them.<br /><br />Edit 2/08: I should also point out that this book has no index or decent TOC. To find, say, Dragon, you have to go to the beginning of the Sicilian (in the other volume, of course), see which roman numeral it is, and then flip through until you find the first page.

The answer, of course, is that they take the same number of  moves. This is probably obvious to many chess players, but for some reason  this seemed relevatory to me. Ward then explains why this is useful in  knowing how to use your King aggressively in the endgame.<br />The book has  more advanced material than this. It's a short book, but each page has two  columns of text, and there is a lot of text, not just diagrams and move  lists. What I like best is that Ward doesn't just gush over great moves by  master players, something I've never found helpful. He explains the ideas  and spells out that which advanced players may find obvious.	2000-05-06

The author gives a good account of several openings and explains \\"opposition\\" in the end game section. Half the book contains generously annotated  games.<br />There isn't enough on tactics here, and the writing can be dull.  Lasker basically just strings long paragraphs one after the other without  relief.<br /><br />Edit: After about 15 years with this book, I can say it is not really good for novices. Some of the material is for absolute beginners, but much of it jumps a bit further along (maybe for advanced beginners). It's presentation leaves something lacking compared to today's works: mostly long text paragraphs with embedded variations.<br /><br />Still, there's good stuff here. The opening section is dated, but actually gives the reader a pretty good foundation on how to play them. E.g., the double king pawn openings are explained through the lens of Black trying to play P-K4. The endgame section isn't bad, but I think the middlegame section is wanting. The annotated games at the end may be the highlight of the book. 48 of them from the around the WW1 era.<br /><br />I can honestly say I've gotten a lot of use from this book over the years, but I doubt it's the best at what it is trying to do.	2000-02-01

It would have  broken up the monotony of the book too.<br />There is undoubdtedly some value  to the basic drill of looking at a chessboard and picking the best move.  But even here the basic format often gives it away: Pandolfini basically  tells you the your opponent has blundered and that there's a fork or pin  coming up.

There's usually 2 or 3 games shown per player,  which in actuality isn't enough to characterize that player. I think the  book could be tighter in showing the connection between one generation's  ideas and the next generation's refinements.

US	51863496	R1XB5Z3S74QANC	0374159963	184001758	Gain	Books	2	1	5	N	N	A very disappointing novel	Galatea 2.2 and Goldbug Variations are two of the best contemporary novels I have read, so I was excited when Gain was released. However, this book was a major disappointment. I thought Powers provided a plausible history  of Clare Corporation, and his description of what a cancer patient seems  realistic (though not having cancer myslf, I can't be certain). However,  the novel lacked the intellectual brilliance of his previous novels, and  the prose was less dazzling. I realize a lot of people find Powers' other  works difficult, but Gain lacked the qualities that make him such a unique  writer. In addtition, the plot of Gain provided no tension or drive. This  wasn't a terrible book, but wasn't what I had hoped for after Galatea 2.2.	1999-02-14
