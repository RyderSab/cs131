US	51115543	R36KLRT3WHKDZR	1593090390	845668304	Fate's Redemption	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A very intelligent read, VERY thought provoking!	Fate's Redemption is a novel that allows us to peek into the lives of three successful brothers. This book is first and foremost a story about interracial love and the impacts it has on individual lives, society, and families. Fate's Redemption takes a hard honest look at race and answers the questions we really dont want to answer but that we know other races want to know. This novel is about race, love, and relationships. Keith Lee Johnson is a descriptive writer who I see as the next James Patterson, he can weave a tale of suspense and this book does a great job of getting you at the first page and holding your attention to the very end. This book will have you missing sleep to read. I give it 5 stars.	2005-06-13

The length should not be intimidating, on the contrary, it is very inviting. Once you start reading about the lives of Trey, Erika, and Vince you will want to read more about them. The chracters were very well developed. The storyline was very interesting, it was filled with drama and plot twists. This book is truly \\"erotica\\" Mr. Luckett did a good job of making the characters and their \\"adventures\\" come to life.  I feel there were the perfect number of sexual encounters/love making sessions in ths book. It helped the reader see life through the eyes of the characters to be able to experience what they were feeling in vivid detail. This book rightly has worked its way in my top 5 list. I will be buying several copies and giving them out as Christmas gifts. Mr Luckett thank you for blessing us with your gift. This is a wonderful read!!!!!!!!!!!	2004-09-19
