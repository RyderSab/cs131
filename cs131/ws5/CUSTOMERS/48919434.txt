US	48919434	R2511S9ABR4CIC	0552999458	771413298	Dead Famous	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Reality TV Rules	Ben Elton ridicules the human desire for fame with a comical murder mystery based on a reality television show. His style and explanations are both refreshing and pinpoint accurate.<br />I enjoyed 'Dead Famous' for the taunt at our 'MTV' society, the comparison between a 'Death Show' to the entertainment value crowds took pleasure in when gladiators fought in Roman coliseums.<br />'Dead Famous' is a delightful and well written story.	2003-04-30

The author depicts characters which not only intrigue but depict the extremes in society. I do not believe that Ayn Rand was an extremist; it is through her extremist characters in the novel that Rand describes objectivism, the goal towards ego and capitalism, as not 'evil'.<br />It is man's desire to achieve a goal using all instruments at his/her disposal which promotes improvements or degradation to society as a whole.<br />Toohey as a character was resolute in his goal for power and it was this determinedness which allowed him to obtain his strength and manipulate people. Ayn relates the methods used to stifle the soul of man and kill the spirit.<br />Howard Roark strives for a 'quality' in architecture which many attempt to destroy (even unknowingly). Roark's glory is achieved in the doing and the finality of the work. The achievement when completing his works alters the architectural and imaginative ideas of others.<br />I highly recommend this novel to all the philosophically minded readers. Whether or not you agree with the author, the ideas will have you thinking.	2002-12-14

He slowly pulls away from the commercial side to explain the horrors that lurk beneath.<br />The story is of interest until the point where the author pushes anti-globalisation and anti-modernisation, turning many unrelated situations to his viewpoint. The storytelling was akin to describing the industrial revolution and complaining that people were losing their jobs in the farms, as opposed to the American dream of progress and an improved way of life for all.<br />Of particular mention was the Author's description of the failure of communism in The Soviet Union, the failure was complex, based around the political situation as well as ideological and the implementation of the system. Not, as the author describes it primarily as a result of the countries technological outlook. Bombings mentioned in the book were as a result of religious and political differences and not as the author describes it as an anti-capitalistic revolt.	2002-10-29
US	48919434	RBPUCGGBOPS86	0060930136	131784822	The Fifth Mountain	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Coelho's simple writing with a strong message	The Fifth Mountain speaks of Elijah the prophet who is known both to Judaism and Christianity. The Prologue by Coelho explains his primary reason for this story, which may on the surface convey a similar outcome to the 'Alchemist' yet touches on many different messages.<br />I loved the message that one does not always understand the reasons for the unavoidable yet in the bigger picture it all comes to light. Each person has their own unavoidable situations, as unavoidable as the weather. It is how we choose to react and the meaning we give to them which drive us to success or failure.<br />In many ways this philosophical idea may be compared with Viktor Frankl's Logotherapy. The meaning attached to the situation leads one to different outcomes.<br />Another important message is one of destiny. If one believes in a destiny or a chosen path much like Elijah the prophet, one is still required to do the actions and work towards the goal or outcome. Even if it is written in the stars that one is meant for greatness, it does not necessarily mean that one does not have to work towards it.	2002-10-08

'Quality' is the term that Robert Pirsig uses to explain the unexplainable. If the previous sentence sounds too philosophical then skip this book. 'Zen and the Art' is a brilliant explanation not only about the source of happiness, but also about the source of the thought where happiness was formed.<br />It gives me encouragement to realise that sitting in a classroom with teachers whose purpose is to indoctrinate not to teach and learn together may not be the ideal growth experience.<br />I completed my reading of the book last night and many of the ideas, morals and guidance are yet to sink in.<br />ZATAOMM is a classic and beautiful narration for the philosophically minded.	2002-08-16

Orwell attempts to shock us with the extremities that exist in a totalitarian society whose ultimate purpose is to obtain power. Perhaps these issues, as mentioned in the afterthought, are relevant in areas apart from totalitarianism. Perhaps capitalism is also a class distinction where money is representative of power.<br />These and other issues are covered, proving Orwell's brilliant writing genius.	2002-05-09

Alan Lightman's style, written in the first person, is precise and void of overly descriptive confusion. Benito too is void of overly emotional descriptions, yet his personal softer side still emanates.<br />I loved the book and love Alan Lightman's style.<br />The novel as it nears completion does however slightly fade into nothingness, my view perhaps because of my pedantic reasoning. I therefore gave four stars as opposed to five stars. Despite this, the novel in its entirety is brilliant and I highly recommend it.	2002-04-29

Why do I use the word 'Journey'? Paulo Coelho's works each has a journey and a message to share. I do not agree or want to agree with every message, yet the subtleties and the intricate story telling kept my interest and forced me to read on. 'By the River Piedra', is a tale of the power of love and Paulo's explanation of true love. Is love solely discovered with the person you are with, or the person you are?<br />The novel is both spiritual and thought provoking.	2001-11-06
