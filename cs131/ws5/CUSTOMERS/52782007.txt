I got the good science, but the story was only average. I did like the Dwellers, and the antagonist. The Protagonist was so-so.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this book is simply this: Once Banks concretes a character in my mind...he really does not need to waste the paper and the ink to continue to paint that character! So many times, I would just skim over his ceaseless desriptions of the character's pasts... I already had the character drawn, inked, and coloured two hundred pages before!  GOSH! (and I loathe skimming through books!)<br /><br /> I was reading, thinking to myself, \\"GET ON WITH IT ALREADY!\\" I just wanted him to tell the story, and quit wasting so much time giving me more and more and more backstory! Really, Iain, I got it! I understand who these people are!<br /><br />The story had the proper amount of twist in it at the end, but once you've read a number of sci-fi magazines, it really wasn't that big of a surprise.  Thanks for reading.	2005-07-27

Most of his books read like you were watching a movie. All of them but this one. This one reads like it is tv series. Nothing bad about that, but the book seemed to \\"think\\" too much. When I read Rollins, I want ancient hidden civilizations, and hidden treasure and strange science that is misunderstood. This book gave me most of that. It didn't have the too much of the ancient civilization, besides the Knights Templar, and all the Illuminati things they talk about.  Rollins is great at leaving a cliff hanger at the end of every chapter which makes you want to keep reading. Rollins is also an extremely accessible to his readers. You can go to his site, send him an email, and he will actually respond.<br /><br />If you want a fun summer read, give Map of Bones a look. But don't forget to look at his other books either. Amazonia, Excavation, and all his other books are GREAT to read; fun AND easy.<br /><br />If you 've read his other books, this one is not as action packed, but more of a thinker. That's not a bad thing, it's just the truth.	2005-05-28

I thought it was well written, although some of the dialogue was stilted. The story begins with a young employee on Capitol Hill, just running through the paces, when his friend decides to introduce him to a secret game. Our young hero soon finds himself mixed up in all sorts of political and mysterious intrigue that takes him -- seemingly -- very far away from the Zero Game...but he is soon to find out that everything in life is a circle and he is right in the middle.<br />If you like political stories with some James Rollins' type action, then this stoy is great. The writer shifts between first person and third often, which can be somewhat jarring in the beginning, but later on, you hardly notice it and it's nice to be in someone's head for a while.	2004-04-12

I'm just a dude with a big brain. With that said, read this review.<br />I read Rand because of its &quot;reader's choice&quot; number one spot in the top 100 list of all time. I thought, &quot;Science fiction, AND on the top 100 list? I can't go wrong!&quot;<br />Gag.<br />The book starts off okay. That's because you haven't heard the same thing over and over again. About half way through the book I was wondering when the aliens were going to show up -- either on the good guy's side or the bad guy's side. It didn't matter which side they showed upon IT WOULD HAVE HELPED MAKE SENSE of the odd way everyone in this book acts.<br />The mystery in the beginning of the book is decent. There are some moments when I enkjoyed the book. But--WHERE WAS THE PRESIDENT?  She never once mentions a president who would be in somewhat charge of our nation! Especially in the 40's or 50's or 20's or whenever this book is supposed to happen.<br />HERE IS MY BIGGEST TWO PROBLEMS WITH THIS BOOK.<br />1) The longest da mn diatribes you have ever read. One lasted for like FIFTY PAGES!!  NO ONE talks this long and this thoughfilled. No one can hold that much philosophy in their heads and manage it so effortlessly!<br />2) The heroes of the book were basically a bunch of quitters.  They all hid out until the end. When, if they saw what was going to happen before it happened, they could have gotten into a number of key political offices (apparently not the office of the president because there is no such animal in this story) and ran their enemies out. I mean, they are a bunch of smart guys. But no. Our heroes decide to go and hide out in the mountains. Wow, I'm impressed they gave up. They are my heroes.<br />Why was this considered the best book of the past century?<br />Someone tell me please.	2003-08-23

So I figured this book would lead me into his maturing and learning how to to use his powers. Um, no. Apparently Van has been fighting a war some border (don't know where because there is no map!) and has this great reputation. We never actually get to SEE him do any battling. As a matter of fact he doesn't really DO anything for the first 80% of the book! Not until Lackey decides to, ONCE AGAIN, throw a bad guy at us in the LAST TWO CHAPTERS and have van kill him. So for the entire book, we don't even get a HINT there is a bad guy looming. All we get is Van's wonderfully yucky life. Then BOOM, there's a bad guy in the last 2 chapters and van goes and kills him.<br />Wow.<br />Exciting.	2003-01-31

BR>The problem with this book is, you can see that she writes for money and not the love of a good story. Her protagonist is a young spoiled boy who, in the beginning is normal and patient and stuffy. But please! We all know that you don't have a story about a young man who is NORMAL! Anyone who has ever read a fantasy story could tell from page one that this kid was going to be the most powerful one of them all!<br />Lackey's writing is childish. Every OTHER word is italicized.

If you liked the Luke/Vader son/father stuff, then you will love this story! the only problem is you'll probalby figure it out on page twelve or so.<br />This plot was tired. The writing was boring! If you read this review and still get the book, remember this: You can read the first episode where the Knight has his dream, and then you can skip every other time he has what is almost THE EXACT SAME DREAM!<br />Also, once Nest has gone through the park the first time, you can skip every other time she runs through the park. For some odd reason Brooks seems to think we need minute overkill descpriptions of the area our characters are moving through...even if he's already given us the dead on descriptions FIVE TIMES BEFORE!  I was getting upset with this book because, you take out half the ridiculous scene descriptions and you take out half the internal dialogue and the book is about 150 pages! it was like he had this short idea for a story in his head, but he stretched the story so it would be a normal length novel.

I was impressed with the characterization and the way Hobb tied up all the loose plots.  The protagonist's ending was believable. Hobb writes the story in first person, but is able to use third person to tell stories of others via The Skill. Smart lady. Her portayal of the young man who grows to a grown man was excellent. She leaves certain things out of the story until the very end which is nice. That way, you the reader, will not be able to say, &quot;Oh, I know what's going to happen here.&quot; She does not tell you specific things until the very end that ties things together wonderfully. I am impressed. Read these books, and you too will enjoy them.	2002-11-05

I am on the third book of this installment. So that must say something. Assassin's Apprentice is written in first person, which, initially, bugged me. (Chronicles of Amber is 1st as well, but this one seems to get into the character more)<br />The book is written from the perspective ofa boy name Fitz, but when reading you can tell it is penned by a woman.  The boy character is too full of feelings an emotions that, as a man, I know we (men) just do not have. Not to say that this takes away from the story. It does help, but it is far fetched to believe a young man thinks this way.  Regardless. The story seemed longer than it really is. There is a lot of just standing around and not doing anything while the character sorts through his feelings. He rehashes many of the same things over and over again and it begins to get tedious. The background story of the castle and its inhabitants is well worth the read. The ending is not really an ending, but leads you to the next book. Overall, not a bad book, but not the best fantasy I have ever met. The protagonist seems too willing to accept things as he is told they are, instead of branching out on his own. If someone told me I was a powerful person in a specific type of magic, but I couldn't use it because peeople simpy told me I could not, I would most definitely at least TRY to use the magic and see how much of it I could control. Heck I would try until I succeeded, but Fitz tried once and then gives up with a shrug.  Hard for me to empathize with such a character.<br />I will finish the series, but will move on to other tales from other writers from here.	2002-10-21

I have read almost 1000 books and I have been able to put them down whenever I please and hit the hay...not with these.<br />Although his characters are a little flat, and his plot full of holes, the STORY keeps you moving. The action never stops, ever. I tried to put the book down but kept reading until my eyes were scratching against my lids. The characters of Corwin and Merlin are decently drawn, but Zelazny always seems to drag them out of holes with some &quot;new&quot; magic or magical creature whom we have never met before. The neat thing is, finding out what he will do next, no matter how contrived.  There are some typos and some other issues with this book, but it is a good story and you will like it.	2002-08-02

I had a few issues with this book.<br />First: Pete sits around and worries that he will be caught and dreads over what he has done...FOR 25 YEARS! I think most of us could get over something after that long. It seemed like, when I was reading the last part of this book, the character Pete was still a child, not an adult.  The character NEVER grew up. He stayed a child. Now I dont know about you, but I like it when my character grows and becomes more than he was in the beginning.<br />Second: If you or I had that much money, (darn near a trillion bucks) in the bank, and we were worried about someone finding out about something we'd done in the past...we would purchase an island somewhere in the middle of the atlantic and live there! No truth machines! No nothing but bliss! You could run your company from the comforts of your home by vid screens and have all your supplies flown in!  Come on James! think about it!	2002-05-03

King appears to be, over the last few years, tying every book in with the dark tower series. I dont mind this. I really want him to finish.<br />In case you dont know, King is retiring after finsishing the Dark Tower series. It will be his penultimate climax of every book and every story he has ever written. How many other writers do you know that can tie every book they've written into one crossover series? The man is smart. If you read all his books you will want to read the dark tower series -if you read the dark tower series, you will want to read all of his other books. Genius.<br />Anyway, this story is not so much about Insomnia, but more about The Powers That Be. Originally I did not pick up this book because I thought it was one of King's dark horror stories that he wrote about the time his mother died. (The long walk, Roadwork et al) and didn't even give it the time of day. With a name like Insomnia, how could it not be?  The book is about much more than that, and its not all that dark. Actually is pretty uplifting.  King's characters still do things that make no sense to me, they always have, but he knows how to weave a story, and he knows how to build a character.  KA!	2002-03-15

The middle is very, very suspenseful, but I was dissatisfied with the explanation behind what was happening. Perhaps I have read too many King Novels and see the ending before it gets there. Too familiar with the writer. Maybe I just didn't like the ending. Honestly, I thought the book was EXCELLENT...until King EXPLAINED what the thing was.

TWO: He writes books like we like to read today, fiction that is fast and breezy. Think of it this way, when you are reading a King novel, you are getting the best of both worlds.	2002-03-12

Pistone	Books	3	2	5	N	N	I read this book when it came out many years ago	and let me tell you: It was pretty damn scary. To think these people really live these lives and do these things! Ack! The movie was not that good. The only reason I gave it three stars was because it had a pretty long middle that got me flipping pages without reading it.  He went into too much details on the daily lives of these thugs. Some detail I like, but this was too long for me!	2002-03-12

This was the kind of book you can read during a saturday/sunday reading fest. I liked the lead character Roland a lot. If you like those, &quot;End of the World&quot; type stories, where there are only a few people left alive on the earth, you will love this story.	2002-03-12

It seems to me that a lot of the newer fantasy is written in todays languages with todays moralities and ideals. This book is written just like good ol fantasy you grew up with. Nice. Read all of Fiest, his stuff is pleasing to the eye and inner ear.	2002-03-09

Any time you can get information from an editor of a book, by all means, go for it.  This book is written by an editor so one would hope you would get some insight to getting published. And you do. That is, you do if you haven't already read a number of other books on writting. Funny thing is, most books on writing tell you the same stuff, and this one is no different than, Writing the Blockbuster Novel, How to Write a Damn Good Novel, Self Editing for Fiction Writers and the such.  I would recommend to you, the aspiring novelist to READ THIS BOOK, but also to read two others: Elements of Style (type that into the search window on Amazon, its by Strunk and White) and On Writing, a Memoir of the Craft by Stephen King.  Great book on what to do and what not to do.	2002-03-09

How to not write. It made a big difference to me.<br />Especially the parts on beats and dialogue and point of view.<br />If you are a new writer and are only going to get one book, then by all means, get this one.<br />In addition to this book I would recommend reading: Elements of Style by Strunk, and On Writing by Stephen King.	2002-03-09

The story was well told and then characters were first rate. He goes into more of established cities and lands like in Fiest, and has a wide open epic like Goodkind and Jordan.  What I really liked abou this book was the way the magic took a backseat. It was well put into the story, but didn't over power it.  Unfortunately for Mr. R.R. Martin, I have weaned (sp?) myself off of all multiple book sagas until the last one comes out, and then I read them all at once. (Thank you Mr. Robert Jordan and Mr. Terry Goddkind.) I find I have such a busy life, I forget what happened in the books prior.  Maybe that's my fault for being a bad reader, or maybe thats the writer's fault for not writing memorable fiction.	2002-03-09

It had about 12 of the 20 plots in it! Give me a break! Get Self Editing for Fiction Writers, The First Five Pages, How to Write a Damn Good Novel or many others out there.<br />SUGGESTION: Two books that helped me out, more than any other, On Writing by Stephen King and Elements of Style By Strunk and White. Read those as well as this book, and you should have enough tools in your belt to get the job done.	2002-03-09

(Didn't like Hyperion) I read it and was liking it...until they got to Philadelphia. Once they got to Philly, the story bogged and bogged. It seemed like Philly was supposed to be the climax and Simmons decided to carry the book on even further to a penultimate ending instead of the simple one he'd originally envisioned. I liked this book, but it was overly long. To me, if they had cut out half of the [stuff] in Philly, the rest of the book was okay.<br />Give it a read. Its at least as good as most other books out there. Simmons is no King, not many are.	2002-03-09

Eye of the World was a good book, not great, but good. But the man has so many plot threads into the story by the fourth book, that you have RE-read every book before it so you dont forget what happened! SO eventually, when you get to the 10th or 11th book, you will be doing nothing but reading Jordan ALL the time, waiting for the next book to come out!<br />Save your sanity, don't even start on this saga. FOLKS! This book came out in 1993!  It is almost TEN YEARS LATER and he still is nowhere ready to finish the series!<br />DO NOT START ! You will either get addicted or insane...	2002-03-09

I HAD TO KEEP A DICTIONARY BY THE BED the entire time I was reading it.  Hey folks, I'm no dummy, college educated and all, but this book's vocab was much higher than mine. Also, the story was VERY broken up into bits that the writer never seemed to fill in.  I could not seem to figure out how certain characters got certain powers and were at certain places at certain times. Maybe it just me. Eh, what the heck, READ THE BOOK! Its great! If your IQ is over 160 maybe you'll enjoy it.	2002-03-09

This book told me more than any of those other books and much of what the other books left out, this book  gave me.  It also goes into detail on King's life. Excellent. I cried while reading it, and that is rare for me.  Even if you dont want to learn how to write, read the beginning of the book for the story, its great.  I dont give out 5 star reviews every day, but this one deserves it.	2002-03-09

They all get into the same stuff, Point of view, resist the urge to explain, exposition, tell the story in the now, dialogue, and many many more. If you have told yourself you are going to write a book and you wanted to get a book on the craft, then by all means get this one. It is no different than, Self Editing for Fiction Writers, The First Five Pages, How to Write a Damn Good Novel or many others out there.<br />SUGGESTION: Two books that helped me out, more than any other, On Writing by Stephen King and Elements of Style By Strunk and White.

You have to wade through numerous longueurs in the middle of this story where absolutely nothing happens!  But you still keep reading to see if it ever reaches a frution that is satisfying. But, alas, it never does! A question: Why, if there were a God, would this God need giant ships traveling through space to perfect Their universe? If you are a God, then you should be able to complete the perfection without doing experiments!  I read and read and fought through the boring waiting as the characters simply sat and did nothing during their long trips.  Hoping that the benevolent race would make themselves apparent. That it would be sort of like Close Encounters.  Not some completely preposterous idea that ACC seemed to pop out at the end!  RIDICULOUS!  If this was the plan of some all mighty God, then it was seriously flawed and I don't think I would want to live in their universe!  I wanted to meet some aliens! I wanted to meet some higher beings who created all of this! I wanted MORE!  That had to be the most let down ending of any book I have ever read in the history of ever!  Save your nickel and go get some chewing gum. You will enjoy it more.  Mr. Clarke, I don't believe I can read your books any longer.  The first RAMA book was awesome. I was completely intrigued. But when you tried to explain what was behind the ships, your explanations were less than acceptable.	2001-05-04

Some of the readers need to remember that this is a GRAND story, with very far reaching effects into a rich world. Instead of seeing each book on it's own, look at them as an entire story, one that has got to have a middle that builds up the end. It just happens to be that this is one LONG story, and, with that in mind, you can understand its LONG middle! I am sure that none of the readers would want Bobby to end the story in one quick swoop. -Take as long as you need Bobby, we'll still be buying the books...	1998-11-21
