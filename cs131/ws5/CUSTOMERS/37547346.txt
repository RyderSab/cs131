Poor Z. wrote a good bit of crap in the 1980s up to his death in 1994, so if you've read any of that, don't write off the early stuff. <br /> <br />\\"Lord of Light\\" builds on the foundation of earlier SF.  Whereas the idea of a sleeper-ship whose crew decide to lord it over their charges on the destination planet---and I mean, Lord it over them---might've been a plot in itself for Heinlein or Clarke, Zelazny leaves this so much in the background that it's really handy to have that part indicated on the back cover. <br /> <br />I didn't find the chapters disjointed or mere \\"tales,\\" though time may pass between them.  I will pass along that, in my teens when I first read the book, it took me a while to catch on that chapter 1 is \\"in medias res\\"---chapter 2 goes back to the beginning of the story, and the book advances from there. <br /> <br />A clever, funny, poetic, and touching book.  Z's better books are valuable for their style alone, even when the plot and characters are as good as they are here.  He, Vance, and maybe Brunner are the great SF stylists of the Sixties.	2005-09-14

My quest for a good \\"general reader\\" account of Darwinian evolution continues.  Mayr's book is the closest I've come yet.  Its topical orientation is a welcome break from the many historical accounts one finds.  And Mayr's authority is of course tremendous. <br /> <br />But the book seems to assume a familiarity with lots of species and concepts that I, no biologist but no slouch either, simply don't have.  The glossary is long but could be a good bit longer.  And Mayr's prose is serviceable but certainly not a plus.	2005-08-12

An earlier reviewer wrote:  \\"For example, the author states that most Scholars agree that more than one person was involved in writing Isaiah. It would be more accurate to say that most scholars he knows believe this.  <br /> <br />\\"The fact is it is commonly acknowledged,even among liberal scholars, that the liguistic style of Isaiah belongs to one writer. This was ascerted by no less than Heinrich Gesenius in 1819.\\" <br /> <br />Those who would like some idea of what scholarship *after* 1819 can teach us, will doubtless benefit from Pelikan's book.   <br /> <br />A majority of contemporary scholars do indeed believe that Isaiah has 2 or 3 authors.

Sigh.  Not hardly. <br /> <br />The authors have written a book too short by half.  They have many opinions, some interesting, but it's difficult to know why one should credit them on any given point, as their ridiculously scanty citations will show.  Bombing the fuel facilities at Pearl Harbor wouldn't have done much good, as they could be rapidly replaced.  Really?  Says who?  The authors just \\"know\\" this.  The section on 1941 in Russia is especially odd; one would scarcely know that there were debated issues. <br /> <br />The book is an okay introduction, but if you've read enough about the war to have some idea of the controversies, you'll be dissatisfied.  Though lord knows, any book that tries to put MacArthur in his place can't be all bad. <br /> <br />(And hey, if anyone knows of a book that does Liddell Hart's job better, please mention it in comments.  As it is, he remains the best we've got, but SURELY 30 years of research have counted for something.)	2005-03-23

The standard scholarly bio is Gelzer's; if you want footnotes and an academically limited perspective, go there. <br /> <br />What this book does is to try to imagine what it was like to be Caesar, to be a colleague or enemy of Caesar's---not in some fuzzy fictionalizing way, but in more subtle ways. <br /> <br />I've read both Gelzer and Meier, but Meier's account of Caesar made by far the greater impression.  Certainly no \\"debunking\\" went on, that I could tell. <br /> <br />And the background on Rome, making it \\"Caesar's Life & Times\\" for one reviewer, was welcome to me, and an inseparable part of the author's effort to understand Caesar.	2005-03-15

His Metaphysics was circulating as a xerox copy at the college bookstore; I'm glad to see it in print.<br /><br />Anyone unfortunate enough (as I am) to read Aristotle in English rather than ancient Greek, can benefit from Sachs's translations, though it remains worthwhile to have something like the classic Oxford translation alongside, to compare their senses of the Greek text.  Sachs's object is to recover what Aristotle may've been up to, by avoiding the Latinate terminology that haunts Aristotle studies and trying to find more \\"authentic\\" meanings for the Greek words.  Whatever his ultimate success or failure, it's wonderful to have such a fresh approach to the translation of Aristotle available.	2005-01-23

(\\"Who else, besides Stendhal, has been a psychologist before me?\\" asked Nietzsche.)  Julien's character is a great achievement precisely because he remains, to some extent, a \\"stranger.\\"  Don't we all?  N.b. that both Stendhal and Nietzsche were opera fans; I suspect that the shared appreciation of opera's hyperboles and melodramas may have come from their recognition that we are all acting a part.    Stendhal is more readable than even perhaps Flaubert precisely because of his \\"modernity\\" as regards plot and character.  I have read R&B at least 10 times and will be reading it the rest of my life.  I only wish Stendhal had written a dozen other novels.    Slater's translation for Oxford is also top-notch.  DO NOT waste your time with Burton Raffel's new translation for Modern Library, or the old Penguin translation.  (The new one for Penguin is quite good, but Slater's is better.)  It's unfortunate that Oxford doesn't do a better job of getting its editions of this book and \\"Charterhouse of Parma\\" into bookstores.

I know, because that's how I tried to read it, knowing nothing about GW.  If I hadn't recently read \\"Sphinx\\" and Chernow's Hamilton bio, I would've had problems. <br /> <br />As for Ellis's notion that he's discovering the \\"character\\" of GW, he tries to be a prestidigitator, raising the mystery at the end of his preface and then springing the answer at the end.  This is not a good way to write a serious book; he should've been testing out the thesis at every turn.  As it is, the bit about \\"Washington's strong passions,\\" etc., makes it into all the reviews, so that the book falls a bit flat. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, Ellis is a fine writer (Chernow's bio of Hamilton is a better *biography*, but worse written), and I appreciated learning something about the enigmatic GW.  I'd never really thought about the unprecedented nature of GW's stepping down after the war was won.  (But while the comparison to Cromwell is apt, Ellis's comparison to Caesar isn't.  Caesar didn't rebel against an empire, he rebelled against a republic.) <br /> <br />I got this one from the library, and am glad that I did ... and that I didn't buy it!

Rather, it's an analysis of Montgomery's actual plan for the battle, how Montgomery conducted the battle, and how M. afterwards perpetuated the \\"myth\\" that the battle had, in fact, accorded with his plan.  The author does a fine job balancing regret for M.'s negative qualities with appreciation for his positive ones, even if the latter seem a little thin on the ground by the end of the book. <br /> <br />What's most glaringly missing is any account of what the Americans were up to in the Cotentin peninsula; they really come onstage only in the COBRA breakout.  Also, as another reviewer here has noted, there's not enough on the Germans. <br /> <br />The book's strengths include a candid appraisal of the British infantry's war-weariness and lack of training, which left Montgomery with a relatively blunt instrument.  (This was partly his own fault, since he insisted on using experienced troops.)  One problem the author discusses is that many documents remain classified; also, he notes a late discovery that the supposed shortage of British manpower may have been a myth itself, perpetuated by Churchill or others who wanted to retain a \\"home defense\\" force. <br /> <br />A good book on the Normandy invasion, but not THE book.	2004-08-30

I think Frank does a great job of contextualizing the decision to use the Bomb. <br />  <br /> I'm disturbed, though, by the reader reviews that insist &quot;Frank proves it was moral to drop the Bomb,&quot; etc. He does no such thing; this isn't a work of moral philosophy, nor does it try to be. Frank's point is that, given that mass bombing of civilians was an accepted part of WW2 with or without the Bomb, the decision to go nuclear made sense in view of (1)Japan's intractability and (2) the fear of Soviet intervention (even the Japanese, presumably, are grateful that the Russians didn't take Hokkaido for 50 years a la East Germany). <br />  <br /> The book begins, appropriately, with the horrors of the firebombing of Tokyo, maybe the single most destructive raid of the entire war. Such mass murder of civilians was not enough to defeat the Japanese; and I agree with the reviewer here who points out that it was the one-two of the Bomb AND the Soviet declaration of war that probably led Hirohito to throw in the towel. <br />  <br /> It's possible, perhaps, to justify the wholescale slaughter of civilians through bombing: the Japanese, like the Germans, supported their leaders in waging aggressive war, and paid the price personally. But Frank doesn't tackle that case here. His point, and it's a good one, is that using the Bomb made sense at the time, and &quot;at the time&quot; is the only reasonable way to judge the men who made that decision.	2004-07-26

It gives a good review of the operations in WW2, but often in a potted manner that sounds like a (gifted) high school term paper. There's not always the necessary effort to think about what events in the war mean for the big picture. To his credit, when he DOES connect the dots, it's interesting, as in his claim that Churchill's preoccupation with the African campaign led to Singapore's being undersupported.      And where his hobbyhorse gets rocked, as most flagrantly with his factually inaccurate section on the decision to drop the A-bombs, L.H. is positively pernicious. (See Richard Frank's excellent &quot;Downfall,&quot; which I will go review after this.) I'm also surprised, given his obvious anger that the Soviets were left with half of Europe, that he doesn't go into some depth on whether the Allies should have pushed for Berlin.      Nevertheless, its scope and analysis make this a good book to have on the shelf, particularly if you're interested in the British campaigns. There is much more attention to the sideshow in north Africa than any non-Brit could justify, tho since Liddell Hart edited Rommel's papers, this was probably to be expected.

This is a remarkably clear, sympathetic, closely reasoned book on Nietzsche, the only one I've read that made me think how happy N. would've been to read it. I'm only up to his treatment of the 2d essay in the &quot;Genealogy,&quot; but on every major point, L. is simply RIGHT about N. I was unaware that, as thordane observes, the analytic folks were getting into N., and if this book's any indication, it's a great thing. (Analytic method + continental scope = good philosophy.) Students & others who begin their reading of N. with a copy of the &quot;Basic Writings&quot; and this book will save themselves a LOT of wasted time.      UPDATE: Finishing the book, I'm no less impressed. Wanted to reply to &quot;A reader&quot; who was unhappy with Leiter:      &quot;Essentially, Leiter claims to have have the only non-'misreading' of Nietzsche in the literature [eg, from the Preface, '...my aim here is to provide what has heretofore been unavailable:namely, a book-length overview of Nietzsche's ethics that will be of use not only to Nietzsche students and scholars, but also too moral philsophers...']. Thus, past critics, including Bertrand Russell, Alexander Nehamas, Martha Nussbaum, and his own colleague at the U of Texas,Robert C. Solomon, are dismissed with barely veiled contempt.&quot;      Not so; L. says he's providing &quot;a book-length overview of N's ethics,&quot; which none of the &quot;past critics&quot; listed has provided. Moreover, as far as N. criticism is concerned, Russell DESERVES to be dismissed with barely veiled contempt, not that L. does so in the quoted passage. Nehamas and Nussbaum are far from perfect either.      &quot;Moreover, I find his attempt to, in essence, claim for Nietzsche a unified theory of ethics comparable to Kant to be quite unconvincing.&quot;      Comparable to Kant how? In being unified, i.e., not self-contradictory? Be unconvinced, but I think L. is right that if N.'s interesting, he's not just some random nut but is actually making sense. But if &quot;comparable to Kant&quot; means *substantively* comparable, that's just not what L.'s writing.      So much utter trash has been written about N. that you can't be a N. scholar without getting a little &quot;sour&quot; about the published nuts cluttering your field!	2004-07-06

I'm enjoying the book.  Hegel's been a sore spot ever since the seminar on the &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; where I felt like a complete illiterate trying to read him (in translation no less).<br />Since Hegel's practically the definition of &quot;pseudo-philosophy&quot; in the English-speaking world, it's fascinating to read this treatment by a sensible English (?) philosopher.  Taylor does a great job in the 1st chapter setting up Hegel's problematic, with a survey of German romanticism and its issues.  Those issues are in large part still with us today, so that Hegel's working on problems that should be of interest to us.<br />But are those problems solvable?  Can we take seriously someone who argues that &quot;the rational is real, and the real is rational&quot;?  Taylor's carefully developing and qualifying Hegel's claims of universal rationality and trying to see his case for them.<br />Even if you hate Hegel, or think you do, the great anti-Hegelian Bertrand Russell said that the 1st step to evaluating a philosophy is to engage with it as sympathetically as possible (in a bit of a Hegelian moment himself as I recall:  sympathy-antipathy-evaluation).  This book may be your best shot in English.<br />Nietzsche argued that (1) the world is meaningless and &quot;irrational,&quot; and that (2) humans cannot accept (1).  If he's right, then something like Hegel's system may be the necessary consequence.	2004-04-17

Anything after Zarathustra, except for Ecce Homo, is a good place to start.<br />Second, despite reading a translation, don't forget that N. is a clever, funny, & devilishly smart writer.  Freud said no one before N. ever had as much self-knowledge.  Read him with a sense of ironic humor.  Too often N. is treated as some heavy thundering German, when if there's one thing that drove him up the wall, it was heavy thundering Germans.<br />Third, forgive his attitude problems about women.  N.'s dad died when he was a kid; his mom & aunts raised him, got on his last nerve, & gave him a bad attitude towards women.  Which, regrettably, was not exactly uncommon in the 19th c.  BG&E includes his acknowledgement that his misogyny is a bedrock level of stupidity that he can't escape.<br />Fourth, if you're a Christian, there's a lot of N. that won't be acceptable to you.  But learn what you can.  A lot of so-called \\"Christianity\\" strongly resembles the \\"slave morality\\" that he describes.<br />This is an amazing book that I haven't even tried to describe, the book that made philosophy come alive for me with N.'s comment that, when wondering where the hell some metaphysician's notions came from, one should ask what morality the notions are aiming at.  The book is full of great insights from a brilliant man.  Read this, then the Genealogy, then Twilight of the Idols.	2003-09-05

Well, long book tho it is, H.B. is very readable and a lot of fun for those who love Stendhal's style and persona.  Chatty, honest, quirky (all those little maps!), skipping around madly, with the strange mix of irony and idealism that makes Stendhal so &quot;modern,&quot; this is an enjoyable book for &quot;the happy few.&quot;  I doubt there are many books like it---Rousseau's confessions feel much more polished, &amp; hence less &quot;real,&quot; than Stendhal's book does.  (Of course I'm agnostic on how honest S. really is---but it's a good book, true or not!)	2003-08-04
US	37547346	RNYXG0FGZ80T0	0679783180	325978172	The Charterhouse of Parma (Modern Library Classics)	Books	5	35	36	N	N	Great book, but avoid Howard	Hard to say whether Charterhouse or Red &amp; Black is better; lately I lean to Red &amp; Black (get Catherine Slater's Oxford translation; shun the new B. Raffel paraphrase).  The fun of reading Stendhal, I think, is his narration; one briefly feels as clever, as observant, as clear-headed, as the narrator.<br />The Modern Library has apparently decided that, with so many good Stendhal translations out there (Slater; Mauldin's Charterhouse; the NEW Penguin R &amp; B; Lowell Bair's Charterhouse), it has a duty to provide bad ones.  Richard Howard's translation has errors that even my schoolboy French can pick up.  The New Criterion (which may have its own bones to pick w/ Mr. Howard, true) listed a great many flaws in his command of the French.  And he's tone deaf to Stendhal in many of my favorite passages (not as bad as the old Shaw Penguins, but bad enough).  If you read Howard's Stendhal &amp; think you don't like him, try a better translation.	2003-08-01

Lovecraft: Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Best single Lovecraft collection	Having thought this one was out of print, I was about to get the Joshi/Penguin editions, but stopped after I saw this was still around.  A few people's favorites are missing, but this is the closest thing to the core of HPL's weird imagination.  Joshi's endnotes might be interesting to those who like such things, but HPL is not yet (thankfully) the kind of author who must be annotated if he is to be understood.<br />I can't really add anything to what so many others have said about HPL's appeal.  The magnificent paranoia of his tales, the notoriously purple style and eerily repetitive plots - it's not a stylistic or imaginative fault, the repetition, so much as something almost Freudian - makes them uniquely memorable.  I haven't read an HPL story in 10 years, I'd say, but having been reminded of him the other day, I'm looking forward to ordering this collection &amp; renewing the acquaintance.<br />(Oh, &amp; note to whoever wondered what T.S. Eliot/Virginia Woolf fans would make of HPL:  I'm a fan of all 3, and there's something about HPL's construction of an alternate universe, viewable only through the fragmented reports of his narrators' horrible experiences, that has a very modernist quality, to say nothing of the themes of decadence and insanity.  Modernism cuts a broad swath, as I noted Louis Menand recognized when he compared Tolkien's appeal to Proust's in the NYRB a while back ....)	2003-07-17
