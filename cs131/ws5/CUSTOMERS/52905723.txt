This book basically introduces the reader to the basic priciples of iridology. In it, the authors describe the different marks that one can find on the iris and describes the associations each area has with the body.<br /><br />The ability to self-diagnose with the use of this text is limited. The eye charts, although interesting, are so specific that without the use of digital imaging, the best one could do is generalize.<br /><br />The largest problem with the text is the lack of research provided. There are a few studies mentioned without the supporting data, but nothing substantiating the claims. Of course, the whole area of iridology is basically still in its infancy, from a purely research oriented perspective.<br /><br />With that said, the whole idea is pretty interesting, and if you know nothing of the science, this book will do nicely as an intro.	2005-08-21

This book with mainly two things in mind: communication and understanding. The author's adopt their longstanding research about the world of typewatching into an intelligible book about the main areas of the work environment such as problem solving, conflict resolution, time management, etc.<br /><br />Any manager that has direct reports would do themselves a favor by reading this book. This book will also provide support for a subordinate that doesn't quite \\"fit in.\\" For those hurried types, each chapter ends with guidlines in a charted format for working with those of other preferences. Although this is somewhat useful, what I don't like about the approach is that they focus on the four preferences instead of focusing on the four major groupings, forcing the reader to combine and study the effects. For example, the charts will explain how an E should lead an I, etc. I believe that it would be much more useful to categorize the charts by the four major groups (e.g. NF's, NT's, SJ's, SP's) and how to interact with other types in each subject area.<br /><br />To the author's credit, the book does provide an overview on the major strengths and potential weaknesses of each of the 16 types in the workplace, for those who aren't familiar with the MBTI. However, it does not really provide a concrete method of determining type, leaving the reader somewhat guessing with the use of anecdotal phrases.<br /><br />Overall, I find this book well worth the investment. However, I would not recommend this book as an introduction to typewatching. If you are familiar with type, the specific chapters will be meaningful, if not, pick up either the precursor to this book by the same author's or one of David Keirsey's works prior to reading this.	2005-08-19

The books are grouped thematically in order of appearance. This book was originally written in the 60's so it does lack some of the more recent and critical textual studies that have been developed. In fairness, it does discuss some of the difficulties surrounding authorship and dates that still exist.<br /><br />Each book is broken down with the use of an overview, main themes, and critical passages. A basic outline of each book is also provided. There are study group questions and application ideas presented at the end of each chapter if you are looking for general questions best served for Sunday school classes, study groups, etc.<br /><br />If your Bible is simply the text without any commentary, this little text will prove helpful. However, most of what is contained here is general in scope and contained at the beginning of each book in most mid-range to high-range study bibles in print today.	2005-07-29

It basically examines the various phrases (e.g. son of man) associated with the messiah(s) that were expected throughout this period. It certainly was written from a research standpoint to be used for research and not intented as a casual reading.<br /><br />This book gives a fair review of the various expectations such as a warrior type messiah, a suffering servant, as well as some lesser known movements such as the two messiah movement and even the Christianized returning messiah dogma.<br /><br />For the most part, the author is not identifying the messiah as any particular individual, but is trying to provide a broad scope look at the many movements and possible reasons as to how they developed and evolved from one type to another.<br /><br />Drawing heavily upon the Dead Sea Scrolls, the author examines the various Bible texts that imply messianism and attempts to place these messiahs in their proper context. I believe that any serious student of this period would do well to have a copy of this book handy as it should prove to be a well used and well cited text as the research and debate about messianism thrives and grows.	2005-06-11

Inference is heavily used but in all fairness can not be discounted outright.<br /><br />Literalists will find this book appauling as it directly confronts some of dogmatic interpretations that have been received through the Hellenistic worldview. However, I wouldn't necessarily classify this book as a Hebraic roots text if that is what you are looking for.<br /><br />I think that this is a decent book in that may force the serious student to examine the foundation of their respective interpretations in light of the fact that most do not read the Bible with a cultural sensitive background. This book may serve as a launching point to a study of near eastern cultures as they relate to the Bible but is certainly not exhaustive.	2005-06-02

The ideas contained within are certainly valid for any age.<br /><br />This book is about sensitivity, not sensitivity to the weeping child, but the sensitivity required to maintain a successful business. This books speaks about being not only sensitive to your customers, but being sensitive to your employees, a major problem with many companies finding it difficult to survive.<br /><br />Actions speak louder than words, everyone knows it, hardly anybody does it. Empowerment, give people the means and freedom to shine. Listen, quit trying to teach the world, let the world teach you. Keep things simple, simplicity allows for focus and leads to success. Easy concepts to understand, not so easy to apply. This book is about principles.<br /><br />It could certainly be argued that most of the advice given in this book is anecdotal, but this fact is also why it has lasted this long as a viable text. Those that want to argue this point are usually the same individuals that don't understand the principals and don't apply them, hence why they need this the most. Sure, most people intuitively know these principles, but how many need reminded?<br /><br />People are moved more by general concepts that are flexible enough to be applied to most situations.

He presents his seven steps to studying the Bible in its proper context. Drawing heavily upon the teachings of George Lamsa, he presents other possibilities for understanding some idiomatic expressions contained in the Bible.<br /><br />I can't say that I agree with everything that is contained within this text. I think other scenarios are more probable, but will fairly allow for the possibility.<br /><br />I do reccommend this book, not necessarily for the interpretations contained within, but for the good advice on how to approach the Bible's teachings and how to frame the study so as not to ignore the proper context.	2005-05-28

The language is appropriate for both graduate and undergraduate classes. I used this text as part of a Total Quality Management class in a Ph.D. program.<br /><br />It is organized into six fundamental divisions of any organization. The six divisions are the environment, planning, organizing, leading, controlling, and innovation. There are numberous charts and graphs that help the reader visualize many of the concepts presented. Also found scattered throughout are snippets from the quality heavyweight Philip Crosby of \\"Quality is Free\\" fame.<br /><br />Due to the age of the text, this text will most likely find its way to the reference section of most classes or in a private library of an acedemic researcher. The reason for this is because it was compiled at the dawn of the age of the Internet and is clearly outdated in this respect. It merely scratches the surface of the influence that the Internet has on particular businesses and can only offer anecdotal inference on the subject.<br /><br />However, if you can overlook this lack of information and should you find the need for a good overview on the entire workings of an organization for practical usage and want to find a text to reference for some stimulating thought on where and how to structure a business, this book will do nicely. It is truly comprehensive for its time and still largely applicable today.	2005-04-24

There are also other essays present that discuss the history of the Star of David symbolism and the mystical golems.<br /><br />The author presents the case of how Sabbatianism and Hasidism influenced the messianic themes that are prevalent in today's Judiasm. Some of the more interesting readings cover the notion of Sabbatianism and its transformation to a sect that believes in a messiah that pointed the way to redemption through sin as a result of its heretical leadership.<br /><br />Identifying some of the religious inadequacies of Sabbatianism and how they gave rise to Hasidism and the notion of a messianism that focuses on self and personal redemption, the author presents a plausible argument worthy of serious debate for years to come.	2005-04-03

It is extremely easy to read without the use of complicated language. The knowledge is practical and fairly easy to remember, as long as you're trying. Get it, read it, study it, and give it as a gift! I don't give many 5's.<br /><br />This author expounds his earlier work of the same title to include devoted chapters to the major areas of most peoples' lives; that of marriage/dating (amusingly labeled \\"Mating\\"), parenting, and leadership (i.e work). Each one of these chapters is worth the price of this book in themselves. This book is a lesson in tolerance, understanding, and harmonious relationships.<br /><br />Of course, there's a temperment sorter for the reader to take and in-depth descriptions of each of the sixteen personality types using the Meyers-Briggs classifications (i.e. I or E, N or S, N or T, and J or P). I think this author's definitions are more intuitive than Meyers and Briggs. With the use of easy to understand figures, anyone can figure out the temperments of those people around us with a high degree of accuracy with very little practice.<br /><br />I simply love the way that Keirsey breaks down the various temperments into four basic types (Artisians, Rationals, Guardians, and Idealists) and discusses each types' strengths and areas in need of development (of which none of us are immune). The simplistic use of diplomat, strategist, tactician, and logistics makes this book easy for anyone to understand.	2005-01-16

The Jewish insistence on using primarily a oral tradition while avoiding codifying their positions basically weakened their ability to mobilize on a wide and consistent scale.<br /><br />On the other hand, the early church fathers use of the written vernacular developed a consistency that could be studied easier and advanced faster as opposing critical arguments were presented, \\"Learning from the past\\" if you will.<br /><br />The reason I have given this an average rating is that the reading is a bit redundant at times.	2004-12-12

In all fairness, interesting not fascinating, hence the rating.<br /><br />The text does not read like a dictionary so it isn't too hard to comprehend and most readers will polish this off in a couple weeks even at a liesurely pace. However, I would classify this book as a reference book since that may be where you find the most use for it and not something you just sit down and read, unless you are a trivia buff of sorts.	2004-12-12

Most people will be able to get through this in a week, others who really don't like to read about these subjects can take a month and only have to read for a brief 5 to 10 minutes.<br /><br />The lessons are practical enough to not overwhelm the alpha male.

The primariy focus is on the order of prayer as used through the use of a Siddur. I found the background to why certain traditions exist interesting (my primary motive for reading it), but found the many chapters devoted to what order certain aspects are performed on what occasions taxing. In fairness, this is primarily because I'm not Jewish, not because of the writing. However, for the Jewish person wondering why they do certain things at certain times, this book will prove to be very educating.<br /><br />I did find the discussion of how the certain traditions relate to the Bible or the Torah a bit lacking, since the text largely is devoted to syntax and order of the tradition, not the reasons. In summation, for a Jewish reader, this book will prove to be extremely helpful for your studies. For the non-Jewish reader, unless you are scholarly this may not be the best choice for you.	2004-12-12

In it you will find most of the difficult but most interesting aspects of life expounded.<br /><br />Rumi has a fun way of simplifying life with entertaining stories and constantly shows an extreme love for his closest historical companions.<br /><br />Rumi is most kind and respectful to the figures of the Bible (particularly kings David and Solomon of the OT and Jesus of the NT). I say this with the full admission of being a Christian. It is quite obvious that this individual values humanity at the core and sees all people as God's children. We should all benefit from such an example.<br /><br />The only thing I found difficult was that some of the allegorical content is hard to decipher being 800 years removed from the true context. However, the translator's comments at the beginning of each section and the notes in the back of the book clarify much and help the reading immensely.	2004-09-11

There is adequate discussion of the various versions and how they were produced and the abundant trials along the way for many of the first translators trying to get the Bible into the common masses' hands.<br />From there this book delves into textual criticism which is a logical course given that the Bible's various interpretations have much to do with the actions done in the name of God. This leads the authors to discuss how the Bible was/is used by its readership throughout history. I thought that there was not nearly enough discourse on the major threads of Christianity and Judaism, given the absolute importance of these denominations and Western civilization.<br />Finally, and discouragingly, the book ends with liberation theology with a main focus on feminism and African-American advances and here is where this book reads like a political agenda or a subtle apology. I found these issues a poor choice for the last 50 pages of the book. Should they have been ignored, probably not, but overkill comes to mind.	2004-07-19

I used this text as a part of a Ph.D. curriculum.<br />The book is broken up into three main segments; strategy, organization dynamics, and practical application with future considerations.<br />Each chapter within each segment has three main sections; topical discussion, cases, and readings (i.e. journal type articles) related to the chapter's topic in that order. Although I think it would have better to have the readings before the cases, it not really that impeding.<br />I found the topical discussion to the point, borderline brief, which is good since most people only can remember 10% of what they're reading anyway. The negative here is that this book may have to be supplemented with other material to cover a semester length.<br />The cases do not present any preconceived questions, so the institution or instructor will have to come up with those on their own. I like this since it allows an instructor to personalize the book to their class, not that they don't do that anyway.<br />Overall, this is a decent text with up-to-date knowledge (as of 2004) to be relevant for a few years to come.	2004-07-10

First of all, this is not a commentary about the books of the prophets so don't buy it if that's what you're looking for. This book is largely a look at the sociological and psychological aspects of being a prophet.<br />This book challenges you to look at the world from a probable perspective of the man and not necessarily the mission, although these subjects are covered at an aggregate level.<br />The author transports the vivid reader into the mind of a prophet and helps one understand the frustrations, depression, and sense of injustice that the propet may have felt. The prophet is not dehumanized to demigod status like most other readings on the subject. The prophet is viewed as sympathetic to God and in tune with the message. These men feel the emotion.<br />What I find most appealing is that the author allows God to have emotions which I find refreshing in light of the influence that Maimonides (whom I enjoy abundantly) has had on Judaic thought.<br />The only negative, if any, is that this is not the most easy read, but what philosphy student likes light reading!	2004-06-30

Of course, a biography of St. Francis can't ignore the spiritual side of this man entirely and I think the author gives his due respect to his accomplishments.<br />From a well to do youth to a poverty stricken reformer, this life is one to be admired no matter what a person's background. The book sufficiently discusses the historical events as an outword expression of the transformation of the man, but not necessarily the transformation itself for the student trying to study the method.<br />If you wan't to learn of the man and the development of his order, this book will do nicely.

This is one of the true practical Kabbalah manuals with its endless combinations and meditations, and workings of the mystical tree that all but the most advanced will find themselves re-reading paragraphs.<br />The addition of other versions makes this book a good one for the linguistic study of the text and is shown in the original Hebrew as well as English.	2004-01-17

The main function of the book is to relate the tree of life to the workings of the human race. However, I found that it quickly became blurred on who the speaker was, was it the editor or the Yehuda Ashlag.<br />Although the main premise of the book was explained sufficiently, the overall benefit is questionable. I found very little practical knowledge to be gained. The book is set in a lecture style with at best some ponderings to be made.<br />It is clear that the system of the author is forced reasoning, but to its credit, so are many other explanations of the tree of life workings. The influence of humankinds knowledge at the time of the original is prevalent but not entirely unreasonable.<br />Bottom Line: There are better books to be read concerning the tree of life system of rudimental meditation.	2004-01-17

In this book, Heschel takes a philosophic look at Judaism and why it much more than a religion, but a way of life.<br />Even a Gentile or non-religious reader can come away from this reading with a kinder appreciation for the religion and inherent philosophy of Judaism. Heschel is able to dispel much of the ignorance and hate concerning this great religion.<br />The structure of this book is sound and concise starting with the general notion of why in his mind there simply has to be a creator.

Maybe this review is a bit tainted because I don't really care for devotionals that much. The reason is because much of the context is lost when one verse is &quot;pulled out of the hat.&quot;<br />I found some of the stories to be a forced link to the verse it was to be depicting (lack of context). I also found that much of the stories were worldly wisdom.  For instance, in one case I'm almost certain that &quot;the end justifies the means&quot; was being presented, and I find no such notion in the Bible.<br />Of course there were some good stories also, but overall, I just don't care for reading that doesn't explain the setting and identifies the context.	2003-11-08

This book is good reading for understanding some of the recent advances of research pertaining to the Biblical flood. It focuses on the history of the Black Sea area and how a plausible flood in this area had far reaching implications in the world.<br /><br />I liked how the author provided various links, some speculative, between the migration of the people of the Black Sea area as a result of rising water, to the development of human civilization.<br /><br />I'm sure the notion that the cradle of civilization not being in Egypt will get some unwelcome reviews, but they are presented as theories that warrant investigation and not as fact. I like a book that stretches accepted knowledge.<br /><br />The die hard 6000 year old Earth believers will be irritated that the \\"global\\" flood didn't happen in the literal sense, but they are descended from those who excommunicated the people who  believed the Earth revolved around the Sun.<br /><br />Finally, the book is an overall easy read and written in a logical fashion that is non-flammatory.	2003-11-08

The author's main idea revolves around innovation, claiming that this is the secret to a thriving business (and I won't disagree with that).<br />Providing numerous ideas and concepts to get the synaptic response working, only a dullard can not find some idea that they can modify for, not directly copy for, their own business model. Balancing a fine line between being too aggressive and not aggressive enough, I really think the reader will have to discover how much or how little based on their own circumstance, this book is not a magic bullet, but not a bad starting point.<br />The most innovative point, not necessarily \\"new\\", is the constant reminder to think beyond your immediate customer and consider how you can make your customer a better supplier to theirs. This is discussed in a very understandable manner.<br />Scenario planning (a really great tool) is implied throughout the text and the Shell organization I think should be credited with bringing these concepts to the forefront, if not inventing it, I'm surprised they were not one of the subjects.<br />There is one point I disagree with, but not vehemently. I don't think that a person can learn to be innovative (I think this is implied).  The best I believe can be achieved is that person can learn not to stop those that are. To their credit, the authors do address this.<br />At times the reading is rather slow, but not hard. So my suggestion is to start with chapter 1 (don't laugh it starts on page 61), my reason is that forewords written by CEO's whom are praised in the main body are not exactly unbiased and the prologue is comprised of brief company biographies that don't provide much to the main point of the reading.<br />I do give credit for a well-balanced approach for all aspects of the business model and accountants should learn well and remember that people make the numbers, not computers.  I do wish there would have been more time spent on employee motivation factors, I just think they are overly neglected in most businesses, but they are at least discussed.wish there would have been more time spent on employee motivation factors, I just think they are overly neglected in most businesses, but they are at least discussed.	2003-08-07

This book's purpose is to relate the sefirot of the Tree of Life system to the whole of human existence. How well it did so could be debated. I thought that the author did quite nicely with applying the tree systemology to the psyche and soul, but found the interpretations as they apply to physical existence to be forced.<br />The only part of this book I flat out disagreed with however, was the explanation and resulting implication that divorce is somehow acceptable and necessary to certain people's evolution.<br />Overall, the psychology used is agreeable in modern schools, but has certainly been influenced by some modern tolerance that is in opposition to the Bible.	2003-07-13

More specifically, he tries to understand why God appears to O.T. folk physically but apparently stopped at some time.<br />There is no conclusion drawn, only that doubt is raised as to whether God has really changed his tacts, or have we caused the rift.

Various parsha are considered and commented upon.  The author relies heavily upon early Jewish literature and not much is original.  However, many English readers will most likely find some considerations of the psychological nature that they may not have considered before.  Alternative understandings are presented to most of the beloved stories in Genesis.  These interpretations were not presented as a matter of fact, which I appreciated, but were presented as alternative understandings to fill some holes in the complexities of the literal translations.	2003-06-15

History is what it is. Hopefully people will learn from the past, but history is also full of lessons that say that tradgedies of the past have a way of repeating themselves.<br />I did come away with a more thoughtful perspective of the symbol of the cross, which is why I would recommend this book to others. I can say that I'm less likely to use the symbol as a banner but I can't say that this symbol can't carry positive meaning either. A person's focus is certainly worth considering.	2003-06-08

This is one of those short books that you read in one or two sittings.  The purpose or theme of this book is to promote sharing and caring.  The concepts are not extremely deep on the surface, only upon meditation do the ideas expand.  If you read just for the sake of reading, this book will be a waste of time for you.  If you're capable of challenging and motivating yourself, it may be worth your time.  The short stories resurrected from the teachings of Yehuda Ashlag are entertaining yet teach simple truths.  The main reason for my less than superb ranking is that I believe the price is too high for this little book.

Every once in a while, I read a book that teaches me life lessons that are not easily forgotten.  This is that kind of book.  Even the most common prayer among Christian can be given a fresh light.  This book is exciting because it allows one to understand the correct translation with proper context.  I believe this author has achieved both.  Starting by setting the context, this author then moves verse by verse through the &quot;Lord's prayer,&quot; giving food by which one can meditate and quite possibly put oneself in the proper mindset to be able to listen properly and hopefully receive God's wisdom.  Every verse is analyzed with the simple goal of setting a proper mindset, attitude, and reverence for God.  Although the title of the book can be a bit misleading, alluding to a sense of selfishness, maybe purposefully, one quickly learns that this is not the case, as it should be.  Buy it, read it, meditate and live by it.	2003-03-16

It is of average readability and best suited in my opinion to a study group.  The subject matter is interesting but dry, I found it hard to focus after a while.  The lessons are applicable and challenging and the premise cannot be denied, we've certainly lost something over the centuries since Christ lived on earth.  Getting us Christians back to obedience is noble and certainly needs to be said, hence the book.<br />Although I found this book at times long in getting to the point, one can certainly come away from the reading with a desire for reverence to God.  Therefore, I suggest that should you decide to purchase this book, find someone to share it with and take your time, you will then not be disappointed.  Even more important, learn to follow the advice and be patient in doing so, for this subject does not come quickly to most of us.	2003-03-16

The author methodically ascends the Tree of Life, stopping by each sefirot and describing its purpose and how it relates to the unfathomable One.  The author describes each sefirot as a gate that leads to further understanding.  Within each gate, the author pulls together many scriptures in support of his esoteric interpretation and his belief of how one can properly ascribe their prayers so that they are heard on high.  Although not easy reading by today's standards, it certainly is much easier to comprehend than the Zohar for example and accessible to those with some patience.  For those studying the history of Kabbalah, this text helps the reader understand the teachings and development of the Kabbalistic sect in and around the 13th century.  However, this is certainly not an introductory text and should only be read after student has at least a rudimentary understanding of Kabbalism and an intermediate grasp of the Tanakh.	2003-03-01

This author gets to the point very quickly and offers practical advice on the most difficult of obstacles to overcome in high risk marriages.  The topics discussed are irresponsibility, workaholics, over bearing spouses, abusive (both verbal and physical), alcoholics, and a few more.  No &quot;magic bullet&quot; is being offered which makes this text more valuable for those that are serious and honest about their problems if they are faced with one of these major problems.  Even though most of the cases presented are extreme for most marriages, this book should also be helpful for those that want to be sensitive to early warning signs and hence, stay out of these situations.  This book is easy to read and understand and is sensitive to those in these situations who may be reluctant to obtain a copy.	2003-03-01

It's primary purpose is to show how one can apply God's instructions (i.e. the law) to modern day situations.  In the process, the author briefly expounds upon what the phrase &quot;Kingdom of Heaven,&quot; may have meant to those individuals living in the time of Christ.  This book is extremely short and can be read by most in one setting (It took me about an hour) so don't expect an extremely deep work.

The author presents a realistic possiblity without all of the fluff associated with some researchers. There is no space invaders, no highly advanced cultures with supercomputers, or any supernatural people are present, just good old fashioned ancient cultures that are driven by the search for wealth and trying to keep their business secret. The possibilites that the Carthinigians, the Romans, the Phoenecians, and others have visited the Americas before Columbus are certainly plausible given the archealogical evidence that is available. The idea that Atlantis will be found in the Carribean is certainly not new by any means but the additional research is refreshing and the way in which the available evidence is compiled is excellent.	2003-01-26

Where this book will help Biblical readers is that the descriptions along with the sketches provided allow the reader to visualize the structure as opposed to just reading the words. I will be able to read Leviticus much easier the next time through. For the Christian, the author makes applicable connections between Christ and his ministry and the tabernacle and its services. For instance, an example I thought revealing was that the silver sockets were formed from redemption money and its associated references become more vivid. This book is marketed as a supplemental to Alfred Edersheim's The temple: Its minisry and services. Many parallel are drawn between the temple and the New Testament. This book will remain a classical reading into the foreseeable future.	2003-01-26

This book covers all of the major ideas in their proper historical context, from Gnosticism to Hasidism.<br />  The author's concept or purpose is to dispel many of the misleading, and speculative notions on the nature of Jewish mysticism.  In the process, taking the mystical/magical portions for the most part out of the equation.<br />  What I like best about Scholem's work is that he is not so concerned with what the meaning of each Kabbalistic notion but is primarily concerned with where it originated and what circumstances allowed for the development of an idea.  This allows for an objective and unbiased consideration of the concept being studied.<br />  What you won't get in this book that you will find in most others about this subject is the promotion thereof.  No evangelical tendencies exist which make for a more throrough reading.	2002-12-08

Although it is nearly impossible to eliminate preconceived bias, this book does approach the subject as well as anyone ever has.  Not only does he advance the plausibility of certain events that have been questioned from a historical perspective, but also challenges some long-standing notions of &quot;proof&quot; for certain events with more practical notions of reality that don't discredit the Bible.  This author very clearly challenges the notion of a strictly literal reading in instances yet does so in a non-combatant style.  This book does a nice job of leaving out religion per se and focusing on the evidence supporting historical plausibility.  If nothing else, to come away from this book and think the Bible is pure fantasy with just smatterings of reality would be irrational.	2002-12-03

For instance, the woman at the well story that I've read dozens of times is looked at from the perspective of the woman in a flirtatious setting, showing the wiles of Christ.  The author basically sticks to the basic premise of redemption from a Christian perspective, but through the perspective of God, or at least his perception of how God thinks.  His approach is certainly unique among the books I've read and most of the methods and logic that drives the ultimate conclusion made by the author is at least to some degree understandable, regardless of my disagreement.  If nothing else, this book is challenging and well worth the time.  This is a book I will likely read again at a future date.	2002-12-03

The differences are explained but the emphasis is on the commonalities with time being properly considered.  Some distinguishing light is shed on the major problem of identifying the Essenes to a small community in Qumran considering various sources that identify certain contradictions.  Although most will acknowledge a common root to the various sects of the time, Pharisees, Sauducees, Essenes, and Christians, this author ties the various texts available and places them in a convincing time-frame that allows for all the differences.  The notion of various sects within the Essene movement is plausible yet simple and that is what makes this so appealing in my opinion.  Overall, a nice piece of detective work.	2002-12-03

This book does a nice job of retracing the steps from Pythangoras to modern day interpretations of the Torah.  The books purpose is not to discount the entire branch of study known as Kabbalah nor even the use of gematria for some interpretations but reduce the possibility of this systems origination in the Hebrew world.  Torah, especially the Oral branch allows the introduction of new knowledge and the infusion of gematria is certainly evidence of this.  The book is written is very understandable terms and flows well making this an easy and enjoyable read.  The student of religion will most certainly enjoy this book.	2002-09-01

I must say upfront that this book has very little if anything to do with science besides some obscure inferrences drawn between creation and religion.  Considering the title I was certainly disappointed.  However, trying to move past the title and the contents one finds a belief that man is essentially evolving past the need for an omnipotent God much less a personal one.  To make matters worse, his attempts at Christianity and attempts at reducing Jesus to man with a vision come right out of the late 19th century with more recent vocabulary.  This book lands squarely in the Ba'hai faith without much imagination.  Drawing some teachings out of Kabbalism, I strongly believe that this book would disappoint even most Kabbalists.	2002-09-01

Although it is pretty clear that it is not as old as the original author would have you believe, this Middle Age text is important from the perspective of its historical influence.  This book's focus is on the branch of practical Kabbalah.  From my view, the significance of the book does not lie in its magical incantations and gematria but its naming of various angels and divisions of heaven and hell.  Unfortunately from my perspective these discussions were extremely brief.  The only thing I would have liked to see done differently would have been keeping the appearance and form of the Hebrew alphabet instead of transforming them into English where the author was not trying to phonetically use Hebrew.  This book is extremely hard to follow and even less practical.  Therefore, if you are not a student of historical religion you may be disappointed.	2002-09-01

This is an interesting book that brings to life many of the teachings and beliefs of the Tibetan Bhuddists.  This book is primarily about the migration of souls and the process of death and rebirth.  I particularly liked the background information given by the author leading into the main text that discusses the basics of this flavor of Bhuddism and the evolution of its teachings.  The author retranslates the title for the purposes of reading and after reading the text, I certainly agree with him.  The two major teachings that I see are what to expect after death and how to prepare for death while still alive.  Although I think the emphasis is on the latter.  I think you'll find that the basic tenets of this faith are found in all major religious beliefs along with noticable differences the further one defines the system.

When we all sit back and reflect on our lives, the success or failure will be largely told by how much our kids love us and what things they remember about us when we're gone.  Another piece of the puzzle is that how our children &quot;turn out&quot; depends largely on us fathers.  I take this responsibility seriously and this book reminds me why.

I thought this was a really neat book.  This book is about the geneology of humankind.  There is little doubt in my mind that genetics will prove to be the definitive tool for all sorts of mysteries.  Archeology will never be the same as a result of these inroads by genetics.  Dr. Sykes' detective sleuthing of the Polynesian migration led nicely into the more challenging task of Europe and eventually the world.  It is very humbling, although not surprising, to know that the billions of people alive today are all relatives.  The majority of the work is devoted to the ancestry of Europeans showing that over 80% of them are derived from a mere seven women.  These types of studies will become a necessary tool in the reconstruction of history and will allow a better confidence level in the results.

Although no one can argue that to be in tune with oneself and one's surroundings is admirable, the method to this awareness as described by these authors is a bit impractical in today's society.  Most useful in my opinion was the works that help the reader take notice of the things and events around them.  What I disliked the most was the blaming of the tempter for our woes, when it is us who takes notice of the temptation and ultimately sins.  Regardless, this is important reading for those of the Orthodox faith and those students of religion searching for the &quot;whys&quot; of what they believe or at least where they have originated.	2002-07-20

This is certainly a classic text and a must for anyone interested in the history of Christianity.  The reader should find a host of interesting topics and can see much of the progression of Christianity and how the theology developed.  A special emphasis on martyrdom is given but is appropriately balanced with the periods of times in which Christianity was accepted.  On the darker side, one can certainly see the seeds of anti-semitism and the division of the church even in Christianity's adolescense.  Considering the many changes that transposed in these earliest years when many of the second generation Christians still lived as evident from this reading, it is no wonder that Christianity is so far removed from its core beliefs today.

The reader will quickly discover that only half of the book is written by Rabbi Kaplan, the rest by Rabbi Lipschitz.  Not that Lipschitz's reading is poor by any means, it just isn't what I paid for.  Although I found Rabbi kaplan's work extremely interesting, I found it a bit brief.  None of the concepts are taken to any depth and only let the reader hang on many topics.  Admittedly the complilers associate the work with a collection of lectures and personal notes but I don't think a person could know until after purchase.  The true value of this book lies in its openness to new scientific hypothesis and its position that simply a literal reading of the Bible is faulty.  I particularly thought the commentary on how two differing opionions are deemed correct, or at least possible, until proven otherwise was refreshing and would be good advice to at least the Christian community.  His brief commentary on the resurrection shed some light in my mind on the general absence of its discussion in the Tanakh.  Overall, it's a good book and worthy of discussion but unfortunately a bit shallow.	2002-05-11

His interest is clearly the exegesis of New Testament passages and their relevance to the Temple language.  Many readers can certainly benefit from a reading of this book, being able to read their Bibles in a much more accurate context.  One can just picture the expressions on the crowds and Pharisee's faces as Christ made use of Temple symbolism is regard to himself.  Another area which I thought the author did a fine job of commentary on was his exposition on the differences and additions to the ceremonies Moses and the early Israelites would have kept, something modern Christianity does not appreciate in its constant attack on Torah.  The authors appreciation of the Hebraic culture is obvious and his striving for reconciliation between the two religious systems is certainly applied.  This book has stood the test of time and appears to have the strength to remain a classic.	2002-05-11

The authors mainly takes a view that humankind can't help but ponder the plausibility of an afterlife. Their studies mainly focus on meditative states of various religions and shows why there is some truth or common theme underlying all religions which is hard to disagree with. Where the authors and I part company however is that he believes that \\"all roads can lead to Rome\\", per se, or at least that all roads lead you to the right road.<br />However, the reader should focus on the neurological aspects which are interesting and where the author's strength lies. The rest is opinion, which they are certainly entitled to. The true beauty of the text is that they are able to at least able to add some physical, logical legitimacy to the notion of deep meditative states and the explanations given by those that have encountered them across various religions. To their credit, they do a decent job of adding some realism to a very controversial subject in the scientific community.	2002-05-11

After what I thought was a homerun in The Mystery of Romans, Nanos came slightly back down to earth with this text.  By all means however, this is definitely an interesting perspective and logically sound and contextually accurate so far as I could tell.  With a little imagination, one can certainly place themselves in the timeframe of early Church and see these events unfolding before your eyes giving rise to at least the possibility of this alternative reading being correct.  What I hold most dear is the ability of the author to reconcile the differences between early Christianity and Judaism in a way that shows that the two sects are not at different and at odds with one another as we make it to believe in today's society.  I'll be looking forward to the more critical reviews that come out of the &quot;scholarly&quot; community.  This book at least deserves a consideration but I believe its going against the flow of mainstream interpretations will likely get this book ignored for no other reason than pride.  Grass roots students will surely appreciate this book.	2002-05-11

I'm not usually big on books apologetic in nature, but what I like about Dr. Ross's are that they are written by a Christian for other Christians primarily.  Dr. Ross does a nice job in this book of presenting material from the scientific community in order to bring harmony between science and religion.  This book focuses on Genesis and primarily with the creation account.  If you're open minded enough to at least consider a Christian oriented approach to science outside of the traditional approaches by the group founded by Henry Morris this book should challenge you.  Ross' spin on Genesis comes primarily from a challenge to the context in which these passages appear that is a refreshing change to the &quot;science&quot; that looks for obscurities that generally drive nothing but a wedge between the scientific community at large and theologians.  It's time to stop ignoring the science that is prevalent in the world and realize that these discoveries should promote faith not hinder it.  This book's pragmatic approach may just be the ignition needed.	2002-04-14

The underlying theme that I as a Christian couldn't help but notice is the large part hypocrisy of the Christian community has played in this continuing saga of man versus God.  This book does a fine job of taking various lives and writings and putting their major themes together in order to arive at general understanding of humankind's lack of faith.  However, the author was open minded enough to finish with William James and thus not discount the notion of religion within the pages of his book.  If you are a serious religious student or even a novice philosopher, this book will give you a better appreciation for the small things that we do that influence those that may someday influence the entire world.  Whether negative or positive is in our hands.  From a religious perspective this book should serve as a humbling experience, unfortunately people punish the basis of the religion because of the \\"followers.\\"  If you're looking for more ammo to discount religion you may be dissapointed, I don't believe that was the author's purpose.	2002-04-14

It gives enough detail so as not to leave the reader hanging, but does not overwhelm the reader with complex issues, which is why it is referred to as sketches in the title.  However, if you're looking for an in depth study of this period, there are other resources that would provide much more detail although not necessarily in one text.  This author does a nice job of pulling together various mainstream resources for his work like the Mishnah and the Talmud, although the Talumud was compliled much later.  The most important teaching I could see was the exposition on the various sects and political forces that exerted influence during this quasi-theocratic state regardless of their tributary status under the Romans.  Considering the time of writing, late 19th century, I doubt you can find anything better geared toward a Christian audience.  For most Christians, this book will help fill a void that exists and continues to hinder a proper understanding of the contextual issues surrounding New Testament studies.	2002-03-10

This is certainly not light reading and very esoteric in nature.  Without the commentary of Mr. Kaplan, this text would be incomprehensible to all but the very elite of the Kabbalistic scholars, which I'm not.  Extreme patience and focus is required when reading and I highly recommend that one read the commentary for each of the 200 points as you go.  Of course this makes for lots of page turning, but much easier comprehension.  With that said, one can find many gemstones within the pages of this book that are largely allegorical in nature.  Although I find the gematria a bit of a stretch at times, I certainly can't definitively discount the exegesis either.  The work along the sefirot and the meditative implications I thought were the most useful of the teachings in these pages, but not intended for the beginner.  The commentary on the levels of the soul and universes I also thought were particulary interesting and useful for understanding some of the Hebraic connotations of the Bible.	2002-03-10

Although short in length, this book packs quite a punch.  The chapter on repentence alone is worth the price if the whole book.  Steinsaltz does a magnificent job of peeling the layers back to get at the core of the meaning of concepts relating to life.  This book is certainly Kabbalistic in nature, but that shouldn't prohibit anyone from picking this book up.  It is written a very easy to understand manner that would make it acceptable to anyone interested in the &quot;meaning of life.&quot;  The author takes intimidating subjects like the sefirot or &quot;tree of life,&quot; and explains their relevance to our lives in a manner suitable for even novices of scripture or anyone searching for some meaning for that matter.  I can see coming back to this book time and time again for methods of approaching subjects of the Torah to those that reject its validity in our lives or those that like to portray it as irrelevant in today's society.  This book could definitely be part of a class in a college or university and would even be suited for certain high schools.  The depth of subject matter combined with the easy readability and the relatively short length make this a splendid book suitable for anyone remotely interested in the meaning of their life.	2002-03-10

The Zohar is the most widely used text in the study of Kabbalah.  This book, written by Gershom Scholem, takes various exerpts from the Zohar to give the reader a basic idea of what manner of instruction and knowledge one can find in the Zohar.  His selections are chosen to cover most of the stages of life and the major questions concerning what lies after and possibly our return.  For taking such a small selection, Scholem masterfully picked his selections to provide a smooth transition between subjects.  This book is very short and can be read in a couple of days without too much effort.  Let the reader beware, if you choose to obtain the full version after reading this book, you might be surprised to find that much of the text is extremely difficult to understand.  Scholem definitely chose those exerpts that are not too difficult to understand for this book.  In spite of its brevity, I would recommend this book because it adequately portrays the Jews rich scholarship over the centuries and their constant striving to understand the more mysterious matters of their existence.	2002-03-10

Written mainly from a Near Eastern context and an archeological perspective, this is one of the few texts that are written about the historical elements of the Bible that does not attempt to fictionalize the stories within.  Although, the author clearly does not take each piece of scripture literally this book should not offend anyone but the most stubborn.  So if your convictions are rigid, you will not like this book.  However, if you are open to other perspectives outside the Christian dogma, you will find this text educational and not offensive.<br />The three main points that lead me to recommend this book are; 1. The author's exposition of the Ten Commandments which will surprize most Christians but not Hebrews.  He mainly confirms the reason why Hebrews refer to them as the &quot;Ten Utterances,&quot; or as the author prefers, the &quot;Ten Commitments.&quot;  He does so with a comparison to the ancient treaty construction which I found refreshing. 2. His basic outline of how and in what order religion evolves.  What I appreciated most concerning this was his treatment of Christ as a reformer and not some revolutionary with some brand new religion as he is mainly portrayed by most even within the Church.  All of which, fall right into line with those Christians that understand their Hebraic roots.  3. The diversity of those involved with the Exodus and the subsequent nature of the kingdom.  All of these points are widely misunderstood among Christianity.<br />Unfortunately, although not necessarily uncalled for, the author provides ample evidence of Israel's idolatry.  I'm not quite sure why this isn't common knowledge and I'm not sure why this idolatry necessarily negates a principle faith in God, but it does in some people's minds and therefore this exposition is probably necessary.<br />The only real disagreement I had with the author is the assumption that the Bible teaches a massive invasion and subsequent wipeout of the indigenous people of the land.  For instance the Bible makes it clear that God would allow the Hebrews to conquer the land gradually as shown in Exodus 23:29-30.  Although the author prevents evidence to support these verses, his assumption is that the few instances of Joshua's utter annihilation were the norm, or at least perceived to be the norm.  If his assumption is the former, I strongly disagree, if the later I can appreciate the manner in which his case was made.<br />Overall, this is a well written text written in a non-combative style that is a nice change from most of the other archeological texts concerning the Bible.For instance the Bible makes it clear that God would allow the Hebrews to conquer the land gradually as shown in Exodus 23:29-30.

Covering the main events of St. Augustine's life from his adolescent years to his death, the author presents Augustine in a well respected manner.  His analysis of Augustine's writings from a chronological standpoint sheds light of many of the misconceptions or debates surrounding St. Augustine's life and teachings.  The author allows Augustine to basically \\"grow up\\" while still allowing him the frivolous excursions of youth and early adult formative years when most people are figuring out who they really are.  People can and do change, and this author recognizes and accepts this notion.  For this reason, if nothing else this text is worthy of perusal.  The book's brevity does leave the reader with a sense that something is missing and hence the lower rating.  As many writings as Augustine produced and as complex as his teachings are, the concise nature of this book does a respectable job.  For those on the go or if looking for a nice gift, this book will not disappoint with its brevity and attractive cover.	2002-02-10

The largest majority of its pages are attributed to St. Peter of Damaskos and the remaining pages to four others.  This book requires the reader to ingest its pages slowly since it is written primarily in bullet form but with enough information so that the reader is not slighted.  Extroverted types will not find this easy reading, even though it would be a worthwhile struggle.  If nothing else, a person should come away from this book with a sense of humility and an appreciation for true patience, especially considering the hurried pace most of us choose to go along with.  I would suspect that anybody other than an isolationist would find this book impossible to follow in its entirety but possible at various times and well worth the effort.  To practice what this book teaches would be a benefit to anyone trying to overcome the world in spite of themselves.	2002-01-21

I'm not quite sure how a biblical archeologist can start off any worse than to deny that Abraham's stories are true, claim the exodus never happened, and that Joshua's conquests are myths. I particularly thought it quite interesting to note that his reasons included that the Bible wasn't written until the time of Josiah and the cities mentioned did not exist at the time of the exodus. How absurd. Most people are aware of the fact that the Bible didn't take on its final form until later so why would anyone think they would use ancient names for cities that have been renamed when most of the uneducated populous at that time it was written wouldn't have any idea where they were referring to. That is hardly proof. What amazed me was that his use of the names of the cities were a major portion of his proof for redating the entire chronology of the patriarchs and the exodus. One of his \\"problems\\" with the current belief system is that people take the Bible as fact but then would use wording from Herodotus? This is the same person that has been called, \\"the father of lies.\\" The only thing I thought that was worthwhile was his exposition on the late period of Hebraic history.<br />If you want to read something more scholarly, with better presumptions (IMO), I suggest David Rohl or even Immanuel Velikovsky. Leave this one to be sold at one of those book clearance sales.	2001-12-19

His knowledge of extrabiblical sources is invaluable to understanding the concept and practice of meditation within the Bible.  For the complexity inherently contained in this subject, Mr. Kaplan writes in a manner that is easy to follow and understand, yet doesn't leave the reader incomplete.

This book gives the reader a very broad appreciation for the art of meditation through a broad compilation of the various Kabbalistic literature that is unaccesible to most people and nearly impossible to taste if your language is only English.  This book covers all of the major schools and their most noticeable differences and provides enough &quot;meat&quot; to contemplate the various methods of meditation themselves.  This book is not an expositon on the Bible, but it is biblicaly based although not readily apparent.  If you're looking for your first book on meditation, don't start here, this isn't a beginners text.

There is one Christian saying or concept on one page, the similar Buddhist saying on the other.  For all the similarities between the two religions, there are as many differences, sometimes subtle in nature, also.  I recommend a serious look as opposed to a quick glance while immersing oneself in these pages or the separating lines will become blurry quickly.  I found the &quot;miraculous&quot; things of Buddha interesting and as a Christian had to refrain myself from a judgmental attitude because of the fact.  Faith is a deep concept in spite of the focus of faith, but it took me years to understand that.  With all that said, this book will give you a flavor of the two great religions to start you in a comparitive study, but to stop here in my opinion would be foolish.

I found this book interesting, but not very deep.  I thought it could have done a whole lot more on personality tendencies.  I thought the most useful aspect of this book was that it teaches not everything is &quot;set in stone&quot; but a tendency to be aware of should its influences give rise.  Other useful information was his sporadic explanations between the basic tenents of receiving for the sake of sharing and receiving for self alone.  I found his lack of references or a bibliography disturbing given that astrological concepts have been around for quite a long time.  How ironic that Kabbalah takes Solomon's teaching of &quot; there is nothing new under the Sun &quot; quite literally.  Regardless, I don't think this book is a waste of time, but I don't find it as something I'm going to be coming back to frequently, as the word astrology inherently implies.

I promise you'll come away saying, &quot;Why that isn't so bad!&quot;  I found that some of my intuitive habits are partial, albeit incomplete , meditative techniques.  This book completes the circuit, making worship more personal and productive, with its practical applications.  Don't let the title fool you, this book is also very appropriate for those Christians that are open to the roots of their faith and the subtle insights of the prophets, as well as those Hebrews searching to fill the void of their ancestral heritage.

This book covers Christianity from its beginnings to the current age of Internet surfing.  The author disects Christianity by focusing on geographical regions to start with and then chronologically within those regions.  Although it covers the entire span of Christian history, I thought the author should have given the origins of Christianity much more attention.  The other portion that I found somewhat lacking was the development of the various Protestant denominations.  However, this book was well rounded in its approach overall and worth the time and effort to read.  If you're looking for a book to discuss the general development of Christianity, this book will do nicely.

By taking a look at long living companies, the author has extracted some timeless advice for corporations to pay attention to.  The thing that &quot;lowered the score,&quot; so to speak is that there were hardly any statistics or hard numbers involved to back up his claims, regardless of the intuitive excellence of their teachings.  If this book is to make a difference and it has the ingredients to do so, I thought some hard results outside of the longevity would have to be produced and they weren't.  What I particularly liked was how the distinction was made between living companies and economic companies.  More importantly, how people need to realize that you can't run a company with some of one philosophy and some of the other.  You'll have to pick this up and read it to understand this, but I think if you do, you'll see that most companies are attempting to mix oil and water today and unfortuneately, I agree that they will be &quot;dead before their time.&quot;  Overall, this was a very insightful book and upon reflection to my own life, sarcastically entertaining.	2001-10-15

In comparison to other religions, this one has the most in common with the Hindu faith.  However, to understand the tenets of this faith, you may have to reread this a few times since the language does not flow extremely well with the English language.  Even then, depending on your background religion, you may have to rely heavily on a commentary.  In my opinion this text is full of double talk and borrowed wisdom that left me guessing how it has become popular and even survived.

It covers the most basic tenents from a historical point of view, while delving fairly deep into their concepts. What I really like about this book is that it covers the many different secular beliefs that abound today as well as where these different systems found their origins. After reading this book, I understand that much like Christianity, different Kabbalists have various beliefs and interpretations of the Bible. After reading the chapter on what the Kabbalist is looking for in a Tsaddik, or righteous one, I'm surprised that more of them are not Christians. As I was reading this text, I couldn't help but think of numerous N.T. scriptures that were nearly identical to their beliefs. Take a look at this book, I think you'll agree.	2001-09-02

Very readable and easy to digest, this book provides a lot of sound teachings.  Being a Christian, I am often amazed at the vast amount of parallelisms that exist between the various religions and find myself less condemning and a result less offensive, which leads to more opportunities to discuss my beliefs.  With that said, I recommend that more people need to be able to understand other cultures and beliefs before attempting to persuade others to adopt their teachings, whatever they may be.  This book is great ground zero reading into the psyche of the Hindu culture, as well as a good instructor in many areas where we have questions.	2001-08-16

However, instead of what I think of as practical knowledge, it spoke primarily in the realm of the metaphysical and theoretical. I can't dispute the author's claims on a theoretical basis, but I really doubt people are going to regenerate their missing limbs like a salamander anytime soon. The piece about miracles I think is attainable, but with much difficulty. The most practical method exposed, relatively speaking of course, is the notion of at least two possibilities for each situation. According to Kabbalah, seeing is not necessarily believing, but I would say that my apparent lack of faith dictates that I am skeptical about some of the things in this book. Examples and actions will always speak louder than words. If you want something similar, but more worldly, try Gregg Braden's writings.	2001-08-16

Dr. Pfeffer takes a detailed look at how power is gained, used, and lost in the world of humanity.  This book is fairly easy to read and is packed with usable information for wading one's way through the often political nature of business.  Even those who aren't aspiring CEOs can benefit from this book.  If nothing else you should be able to recognize THE GAME as it takes place in your organization, and in the process keep out of the line of fire.  Insightful yet practical.	2001-08-04

Instead, the author focuses primarily on the realm of physics, with a rudimentary knowledge of the subject matter. It is very hard to tell where the author is going the entire time, jumping from one concept to another. I hope that the second volume does a better job at &quot;getting to the point.&quot; If I had to speculate, this book is nothing but a rather large introductory message for volume 2, or at least I hope so. Don't waste you money on this one, you would be much better off buying an introductory book about relativity and quantim physics. You would learn more and be just as prepared to look at the mysteries of Kabbalah.	2001-08-04

The concepts are not written about to be understood, only where they have developed.  The author presents his material in a very objective way without any noticeable bias toward one system or another.  Don't expect to walk away from this and be on the road to enlightenment.  However, with that said, I do think it is important to the student of Kabbalah to understand the roots of the matter.  This book does nicely in this respect.  One should not start on the mystic road unless one knows who cleared the trees and laid the gravel.	2001-08-04

This book is very short, hence why it is called Fragments.  I read it in its entirety in an hour.  I liked the fact that the author included the Greek translation along with the translation.  However, the commentary is weak to be kind.  There could have been much more regarding the influence of this work on the following Greek philosophers, or a look at parallel systems developing in the same time period.  I recommend waiting for the paperback if one is ever published.	2001-08-04

Dr. Ross provides evidence for the ancient age of the Earth and the universe.  Starting out, this book looks at the cause of why most Christians believe that the Earth is only thousands of years old.  He then goes on to apologetically convince the reader of the fallacies of this belief.  Although it is written for a Christian audience, this book could provide some witnessing power for those trying to reach the largely un-Christian scientific community.  If you would like to stir some debate in your Church, take a look at this book, it will provide you with the opportunity.  It is also written in a non-scientific method so it shouldn't confuse many readers.	2001-08-01

Filled with pictures and charts, you can come away and actually remember what it is you read.  I wasn't particularly thrilled with the attempt of the author to blend in other various religions as authoritative.  Of course there are similarities but this hardly makes them legitimate.  The beautiful illistrations are this book's saving grace.  However, there are better books on Kabbalah.	2001-07-21

This is simply a great book.  Contextually sound, theologically based, and historically appropriate, this book peels back the layers of Romans and breaks it down into its simplest terms.  The LCD (Least Common Denominator) is the focus of this study (The Shema) and if your eyes remain focused, the contradictions simply dissolve. If every Christian was to read this book and act according to the understanding that comprises these pages we would be united and the internal strife would end (1 Cor. 1:10-13).  At the same time if the Hebrew people would read this text, they might not have the animosity they do toward Christianity, provided we live up to our end of the bargain.  If you read this book and don't come away with appreciating the Hebraic roots of Christianity and a thirst for more, then your heart is hard.  I don't give many 5 star ratings!	2001-07-21

This book covers a broad range of categories yet doesn't intimidate the reader with endless re-translations of text.  This book covers the history enough to convince the reader to study further and presents its case in a clear, logical manner that leaves one hungry for a deep investigation.  All of the answers aren't here, which is fine, the author's intention is just to pry the door open and stick his toe in.  The only negative is that the chapter on Semitic persecution didn't flow well with the rest of the book.  I thought it would have been better as an appendix.  This book would be a great gift for someone who you doesn't quite understand your point of view if you understand the importance of the Hebraic roots of Christianity.	2001-07-06

While most texts cover the Classical period, this book gives the history that preceeds it and hence the reader will have a better understand for not only what happened but most likely why.  From a classroom perspective this text would be useful for a introductory course on Greece.	2001-06-30

Although I don't agree with everything the author presents, especially about multiple messiahs, but his research into the origins of Freemasonry is sound and hard not to agree with.  I don't doubt that there are links between the many aspects of religion and cultic activities in the world today and if nothing else, this text should open the door for further research to develop the author's theories which are excellent leads for any investigation.  If you want to be challenged, I encourage you to read this book.  Even though some will undoubtedly find this book &quot;proposterous,&quot; it is very entertaining.	2001-06-30

Foundationaly sound, this book pulls the most relavant scriptures for the legitimacy of fasting even in our &quot;modern&quot; times. Not only is this book convincing, it also gives practical advice for the hesitant follower. I thought it did a nice job of balancing the notion of fasting for the appropriate reasons yet not with the wrong motives. I'm not quite sure why he subtitles the book &quot;10 secrets of spiritual strength&quot; though, unless for marketing reasons. Overall, this is a good place to start if you're considering fasting.	2001-06-30

It even gives a practical guide for those who want to try these traditions themselves to have an instructional tradition for their descendants.  I thought this book did a good job relating modern observance to New Testament times.  I know that the next time I read the passages mentioned, I'll have a better understanding of the context surrounding the actions of Christ and the apostles.  This book is very easy to read and structured for even the most elementary student of New Testament history.	2001-06-30

I even like the fact that the author acknowledges at some depth the passages in Isaiah 58.  However, I thought that this book could have covered more on the subject of practical reasons to fast.

Being a Christian, I found this book fascinating due to the many parallel teachings of the Bible.  I found myself having a much deeper appreciation and respect for the Egyptian religious system (at least the first Egyptians).  One cannot help but wonder where the two cultures strayed from each other considering the fundamental similarities. Although polytheistic, there is plenty of good, solid wisdom within these pages.	2001-06-16

If you're into a lot of numerolgy or like to add, subtract, multiply, and divide for the sheer enjoyment of it, you will like this book.  Frankly, I thought this book could have been about half as long and I wouldn't have felt slighted.  His implied theory of religious evolution seemed a bit lacking and I didn't care for his branding of Pauline doctrine as an inferior religion to Christ's teachings.  As far as the prophetic themes, well, we'll just have to wait and see, but I won't be holding my breath.  I guess I don't give Edgar Cayce, although interesting, the same kind of weight this author gives.	2001-06-16

However, don't expect this book to prove or disprove any Biblical text.  The majority of this text is mythological in nature and hosts a managerie of gods.  If one digs enough they may be able to relate some of the figures in this book to Biblical antediluvian characters.

I can't say whether this particular title is any better or worse than any other English rendition of the Qur'an, nor will I find out.  I confirmed some of the hearsay that I get from ignorant Christians, while being surprised at some of what I read.  Although there are similarities between Christianity and Islam, there is also a wide gap. In my opinion, this book does not teach or instruct much at all, but is a book of warnings.  The Surah's (Chapters) are very redundant and contradictory.  Paraphrased Bible stories are rampant often leaving out significant details.  Overall, my mood was one of despair and hopelessness while reading, with only an occasional shot of hope.

His insights are practical and his metaphoric language is memorable.  For the most part, his generalizations are accurate, but I also believe that there are more individual traits that can't be generalized solely on gender that make some of what this author has to say inaccurate.	2001-05-26

The chicken and the egg question is not my goal here, but I must say that the lines can certainly be fuzzy if one does not have a solid foundation on which to stand.  This book is a classic in the realm of mythology and is truly a good reference to have around.	2001-05-26

Books	3	3	4	N	N	A classic commentary on the commandments of God	Maimonides, better known as Rambam, is truly on of the great commentators of the Torah.  This two-volume set meticulously goes through each of the 613 commandments of God with commentary on the importance of each.  The reading is very dry, but this set provides a handy reference.	2001-05-26

This book took me back to 1st grade when we were still allowed to sing &quot;God Bless America&quot; and other historic songs that kids today  don't even know because they mention the word GOD!  A wonderful little  book, it reminded me of how far we've come and how high we've climbed but  also how far we've come down the other side of the hill. I truly wish that  our kids don't have to be ignorant of the heritage that allowed the  foundation of this great country of ours, and that heritage is grounded in  the Bible.  This book is a gentle reminder of that basic truth.  I'm glad  my wife picked this book up for me, she picked a definite winner.	2000-08-16

We often get into the  &quot;I don't care what you have to say, just listen to me, my religion is  the right one.&quot; mode and forget that we should &quot;first seek to  understand then to be understood.&quot; (Steven Covey)  This book does a  good job in relating Buddhism's basic teachings to those who want to  understand what Buddhism is all about.  Of course, I have some major  differences of opinion on certain things, but there is also a lot of common  ground between Buddhism and Christianity.  Fundamentally, Buddhist's have a  whole lot more faith in mankind than the Prophet Jerimiah (33:9).	2000-08-16

Sound advice if you ask me.	2000-08-16

If a person reads this book and can't relate the material to their own lives, they couldn't be human.  Dr. Chapman once again has hit the nail on the head with this book.  Practical insights and easy to understand stories help to make this book a  clear winner.  Everybody I know, including myself, will have lots to learn  and lots to practice after digesting the information in this text.  This  book is not only for those of us who are married, but anybody who wants to  get along better with anybody they have a relationship with, whether it is  a parent, child, friend, or even an enemy.	2000-08-16

This book is nothing more than a  supporting document of the Mishneh Torah and the Guide for the Perplexed.  It doesn't nothing but direct the author in one of these directions.  There  aren't even any excerpts from the texts, just the classic, &quot;see my  writing in...&quot;.  Don't waste your money.  The only thing it does say  is that Maimonides believed in a resurrection of the dead.	2000-08-16

The author shares some insight into the study of the deaper meanings of the Bible.  He puts it in  such a way that makes this form of study less mysterious.

Being a very short book, it is more suited for a  coffee table or a briefcase than on a bookshelf.  Dr. Van Impe professes a  pre-tribulation rapture of the church, so for those of you who don't  believe that scenario, then this book is not for you.  This book is also  not intended to be a study of much depth but merely scratches the surface  of the world of prophecy.	2000-08-16

Although it is a very long text, it is full of supporting  documents for the Bible.  If you only have a copy for reference, its index  is pretty thorough.  Or if you choose to read it cover to cover, like I  did, you can't help but learn much about Hebraic thought and history.	2000-08-16

I must admit that with every new book this author writes, the better his depth and subject matter.  Although still basic in scope (which is why he  has to write so much), he explains in layman's terms what his mission in  life is.  I personally like a thorough reading over the &quot;super  easy&quot; which is why this book does not break the 4 barrier.  It is a  quick read if you're on a plane and need some closure while reading.	2000-08-16

From a content standpoint, this book places the reader at the  turn of the millenium (the previous one of course).  I think one should  take advantage of any opportunity to gaze at religion from an ancient set  of eyes.  This text does a very good job.	2000-08-16

It is easy to read, has lots of good information, and covers all the necessary heavy-hitters in the field  of international cultural awareness. I was quite pleased with the way the  author related various cultural teachings to short stories in order to  grasp a mental picture.  Not many books destined to be used in a classroom  setting accomplish this very well.  In today's business world, one would be  committing suicide by not having at least a basic understanding in the  differences between various cultures of the world, if not an in-depth  understanding.	1999-05-27

Most of these  possibilities are worded to do nothing but cause confusion and doubt for a  student just starting out trying to learn what the meaning of the Bible is  all about.  If there is one good thing to say about this book, it is that  for those of us Christians that want some practice taking a barrage of  questions about the Bible, this book is good practice.  I'm quite astounded  that people think that these &quot;valuable insights&quot; are not taught  in today's churches.  If they aren't they should, that much I'll agree  with, but honestly, nothing new here.  Mr. Davis needs to stick with the  Civil War, or do a little more studying.	1999-05-27

However, if you have read his other works or those of Yacov Rambsel you are likely to  be disappointed to some extent.  Jeffrey borrows heavily from previous  works for this book. If I was a betting man, the fact that he got a  &quot;Big Name&quot; (i.e. Word Publishing) to publish his book led to his  choice of borrowing.  Very little new items show up in this text.  Buy the  other ones I have listed, you'll be glad you did.	1999-05-27

I think this use of the word paradox is becoming a bit too common these days and these authors also  seem to force the concepts to make paradoxes out of them.  They also throw  a person's reading rhythm &quot;out of whack&quot; by throwing in the  chapter on Information Technology which clearly doesn't belong in this  book.  With that said, I will say that there are some good bits of advice  and methods which can be used within a business to help change things  around.  Overall, I think it is worth a look, but you might want to wait  for the paperback version.	1999-05-27

Hofstede's groundbreaking work is internationally recognized.  Although the study was done in the late 1960's - early 1970's,  the information is still relevant and interesting.  For anyone who has to  spend time in another country, they would be doing themselves a favor by  getting a hold of this book.  The only problem with this book is that it is  not one of the easiest reads I've ever seen by far.  To his credit however,  he provides lots of tables and charts for the person who typically scans  material.  A must have for expatriates or those seeking an MBA.	1999-05-27

Although, this author is obviously not a Christian, he helps the reader understand some of the things that went on and were believed at the time of  the apostle.  He is obviously confused on the seeming contradictions within  the Bible and here is where we part company.  His notion that Paul was not  really a Pharisee and that Paul mingled various beliefs along his way to  Rome needs work.  Another case of reading the Bible out of context.	1999-05-27

This book covers most of the basics and some of the weightier issues of the Feasts of  Israel.  For those of you with a solid background in Judaism, I would  reccommend Eddie Chumney's book, which by the way Hagee refers to several  times in the text.  This book is easy to read, always a plus with me and  keeps the reader interested.  I do like the way he discusses each  festival's relevance to the; Past, Present, Future, etc.  Would make a good  gift to newer Christians.	1999-05-27

First published in 1986, I'm surprised that such an insightful book hasn't gathered more attention.  One of a Christian's main goals is to reach the lost, this book describes a method by which we could possibly reach more  unbelievers more rapidly.  Even if a person was to not use the author's  specific organization, the solution proposed is simple yet quite profound.  His main point is a winner in my book.  I assigned the 3 rating because the  book is not in-depth and has only one main point.  However, it is still  worth reading.	1999-01-02

This author is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  His study of the Second Temple Period along with his insighful parallels between Judaism and Christianity are worth more than gold in my opinion.  In this book, Young  examines Christ's parables from both the Jewish and Christian perspective.  What I like about this book is that it helps the reader obtain the correct  context of the readings, something that I push for with fervor.  Just  published, this book is a good read and an excellent resource for future  study.	1999-01-02
