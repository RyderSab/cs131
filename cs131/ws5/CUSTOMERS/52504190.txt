Perhaps this is the story Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would have penned were he apprehended at a circus performance and dispatched straight to his  typewriter. Fata Morgana is a solid mystery with fantasy elements that  elevate it from sleuth versus villain into an enigmatic and elusive tale  tinged with Gypsy mystery, parlor games and extortionist magic.<br />Inspector  Picard, career descending and body weight ascending, is on the trail of Ric  Lazare who is bilking high-society members out of considerable cash. Ric  Lazare possesses a machine that foretells the future, but this alone does  not explain his hold on those in his circle of influence. Picard  investigates with the intention of exposing the salon scam of a medium and  his costly advice, instead, he encounters the unknown - Black Magic, Grand  Bewitching, the creations of a German toy maker, and a nagging  foreshadowing of events, particularly his own demise. Picard's sleuthing  takes him through Nuremberg, Budapest and Old-World Paris and everything  Picard discovers lays in shadows, echoes and reflections. Discovering the  background and identity of Ric Lazare (and his stunning wife, Renee, who  has Paris bewitched) is what keeps the reader turning the pages. Clues come  from:<br />1.) The mysterious death a priest. 2.) A half-Paleolithic family on  a one-way forest trail somewhere on the steppes of Eastern Hungary. 3.) A  hashish smoking Chief of Police. (The smoke is rather strong...occasionally  it renders me unconscious.) 4.) A gifted toy maker, his evil apprentice,  and ultimately the toys themselves, which are \\"much finer than men and much  worse.\\" 5.) A library in Paris where a volume of century old letters and  diary excerpts reveal the true, yet impossible, identity of Ric Lazare and  his wife Renee.<br />Kotzwinkle adds amusing sensuality to his descriptions of  Nineteenth century Paris. (1861) What other capital would throw a party for  the Great Whores of the City? The description of this partyand the sauced  satyr, Count Cherubini, who hosts it are worth the read alone. Extravagant  debauchery Old-World style.<br />Kotzwinkle includes several zestful scenes  between Inspector Picard and the ladies - a prostitute, an enchantress, and  a woman in a tavern whom he seduces by hiring a gypsy Cymbolom player to  envelop her in aural foreplay. Picard is quite the ladies man and these  scenes show that while he may be an old dog, the learning of new tricks  isn't necessary if the old ones are masterfully performed!	2000-09-01

His power of description makes you feel as if you are watching a documentary filmed on location. Every reader will have a page or special  paragraph where they are compelled to give homage to these original  Hard-Core Soldiers. Mine was when Pressfield described how the front line  of Spartan soldiers bought their eight footers from the vertical to the  horizontal in one movement, as if the line was one creature, with one mind.  Men in the second and even third ranks, thrust their weapons over the  shoulders of their own men, turning the Spartan line into a piercing wall  of death. That warriors who knew this to be their last battle could  accomplish such unity and precision makes you bow your head in awe. <br />A  battlefield is strewn with tens of thousands of bodies. The horrible mass  appears to move because the wounded and dying in their writhing cause this  flesh mountain to look like the movements of one gigantic creature. Fear  and Death have turned the earth into a shin-deep broth of urine and blood.  What kind of steel spirit would it take to behold this battlefield and  refer to it as \\"The Dance Floor?\\" Only a warrior of Sparta!<br />The criteria  that King Leonidas used in choosing the Three Hundred who would stand and  die at the Hot Gates is the supreme example of harsh Spartan wisdom. The  Three Hundred never knew the real reason King Leonidas selected them over  their brethren, but you will know by the end of the book. This revelation  alone is enough to challenge any ideas you had about Spartans. I had  believed the Spartans were a warrior cult without reverence for life,  something like ancient Clingons, but without honor. I now know that the  Spartans shared bonds of brotherhood as rigorous and sacred as any  religious order and that their brutality contained the raw compassion  needed for survival.	2000-05-26

The letters would be written in an Aquatic  Dialect that no one speaks, but the message is clear to all of us:  &quot;KNOCK IT OFF!&quot; it says in Blue-Green GAIA Script.<br />Oh, how we  longed for the Angels to come. To have them materialize at our evening  tables in a breezy eddy of Atomic-Silver. To let them partake of Suburban  meatloaf and Southwestern cuisine. To let our children raise their glasses  of Gatorade in a playful toast. Jesus uncorks the wine from the wedding  feast and Elijah reclines before an empty plate. Buddha has happy ears,  longer and larger than ever. <br />The Pope addresses the masses gathered in  St. Peter's Square. He tells them in eight different languages that Jesus  has returned and sits in his office awaiting instructions. He tells them  that Salvation will begin as soon as the paper work is completed. <br />But,  alas, on May 5th and the days that followed, we in the Northern Hemisphere  rolled out of bed and went to work and our sister shadows in the Southern  did the same, except they stirred their coffee counterclockwise.	2000-05-11

Charlie raises horses, fearlessly handles snakes, shoots quail, runs his own fleet of jets, is married to a younger, beautiful women, and is in general a good  ole boy -- even owns an honest ta gawd plantation where all the helpin'  folk are black. <br />Charlie is also a man in prime need of a humbling  experience. Charlie is a real estate developer and his most serious  problems develop as a result of a wide-body ego coupled with backward  planning -- desire it, act on it, followed by, plan for it, pay for it.  Croker becomes overextended on a real estate deal for a development that is  largely a monument to himself, even named it The Croker Concourse. This  leads to a \\"workout session\\" at Planners Bank, where Charlie is given a  most unpleasant reception. Wolfe describes the scene in vintage style,  casting a rheumy eye on corporate America and its ugly military efficiency  and total bottom line orientation. It is at this point where you will  realize that you have come to like Charlie Croker, that you are pulling for  this humus head from south of the gnat line, that Croker, raw and crude as  he is, contains a genuine spirit and optimism that has been bleached out of  the rest of us.<br />Politics and money drive the entire story. Wolfe shows  how saturated Americans are with these two Noble Truths. (Even  Conrad-the-stoic's actions, the spiritual soul of this 787 page journey,  were brought about by the frustrations of not being an economically viable  member of society.) A Man in Full is a snort fest, (I read this while bus  commuting and couldn't contain my laughter, despite the worried stares)  Wolfe's satire is as biting as a side ache, unfortunately, the truth  running beneath the humor is a sobering one. This is the kind of book our  grand kids will read and when they finish it, they will close the book and  exclaim, \\"My god, were you people ever messed up!\\" <br />I especially liked  the chapters dealing with Atlanta's black mayor. He is like an inverted  Oreo, posing publicly as white for the \\"money\\" constituents from the  wealthy white neighborhoods, and posing privately as black for the less  economically powerful, but more numerous black voters. The tribal art  collection ebbs and flows through his office in accordance with the  political tide!<br />Wolfe brings the mayor, Croker and Planners Bank together  on an issue that threatens to explode the entire city in racial tension.  Fareek Fanon, a black football star is accused of raping a white woman from  one of Atlanta's most influential families. If Croker, (a former football  great) speaks out on Fareek's behalf, maybe the mayor can help him with all  his debts to Planners Bank? And maybe someone high up in Planners Bank will  be owed a valuable gift in return for forgiving Crokers debt? And if the  mayor quells the coming riots, maybe he will reclaim the straying voters  needed for his reelection? Everyone is itching and planning for the  scratch. A simple premise, but greed and political chess playing enter the  equation, creating a centrifugal force that sucks some characters into the  melee and spins others off into ruin. <br />Ruthless and wicked writing from a  man who portrays American society with a magnifying glass held over the  warts and moles.	2000-01-21

Imagine a black and white world lifted from an old Borgart movie. Imagine mean streets imported from a Raymond Chandler novel leading to a big city called 1950's Somewhere, USA. Imagine Pleasantville, but with smog.  Colson's world is like a coat sleeve that was inverted half way-part of  this world you readily recognize, the other half is a spooky reflection.  You know you have seen it before but can't quite place where. The  Intuitionist reads like a fable from another world that magically tells our  worlds history.<br />The Intuitionists have committed an ideological  insurrection against the Empiricists by using the controversial  &quot;Intuitionist&quot; method of ascertaining elevator safety. In this  eerily familiar alternative world, elevators rarely fail, so the contention  between the two factions appears to be the proverbial \\"Tempest in a  Teapot.\\" However, this is a story about vested interests and how such  interests impede progress, how they will wage a costly war over valueless  turf. This is a story about self-preservation when evolution is clearly  arguing for extinction. <br />Colson's prose is a skin that defines the form  of some famished and untamed beast. I have seen this creature hiding in the  type font shadows, crouched, and ready to spring up at us from the base of  every paragraph. The exact symmetry of this beast I can't say, but that it  is angry, I have no doubt.	1999-12-04

DeFoe, a guard  at the museum, steals the painting for her, hoping to assuage her delusion.  Instead, Imogen enters the delusion further. She leads an unauthorized  tour, telling the museum-goers that she is the wife of the painter, making  up details of their life together, confiding her desire to return to her  painter husband. Strangely, Imogen is unconcerned that the Nazi's are about  to invade Holland and her return to her \\"husband\\" would only last until the  Nazi's arrested her.

Roth attacks the  denouement with an exciting staccato touch, but he diminishes the effect by  employing too many fermatas. A conversation is interrupted while the ethos  of an entire generation is outlined before the conversation continues. The  misanthropic mystery that is Rita Cohen, who calls during the apocalyptic  dinner party and then evaporates, unsolved, can only be likened to a sudden  glottal stop that truncates the music too harshly. And finally, the grand  fermata that is Zukerman - on hold since page 89 while he \\"dreamed a  realistic chronicle, began gazing into his (The Swede's) life.\\" If the  mental copulation of possibilities were an Olympic event, then Zukerman  (Roth) would be solid gold.	1999-10-28

The Road to Wellville is an amusing story of people in search of Organic Grace. These people believe that they suffer from the visceral accumulation of toxic sludge brought on by years of improper diet. Since the rigors of  eating were never mastered better than by the great Cleansed Colon himself,  Dr. Kellogg, they follow his ever command. They scour their colons, blast  out their bowels, purge their way to purity--yet, despite the daily  intrusions to their lower orifices', they still end up digging their own  graves with their teeth. <br />Told with unrelenting satire, The Road to  Wellville is the story of an original Health Nut and all his pampered  followers. Provides great insights into the Fad that still drains wallets  today.	1999-06-16

I have always hungered for an adventure that was ambigious enough that I would be forced to complete it in order to unravel the mystery. Clayton Smith left Andy Mann just such an adventure. Although Clayton Smith is a  dead character, he is the most interesting character in the book. Even at  the end, I was not convinced that he was really dead; like Elvis and Jim  Morrison, I can readily imagine folkore explanations about how he still  lives.

I loved the wandering, Impromptu prose! Breakfast at Tiffany's is a romp through a vapid party; advice on what to do when you've gone from blue to  red; secrets in the past that appear and stand on the street corner outside  your apartment; and finally, a pathetic act of cat dumping. What impressed  me most were the three short stories that followed Breakfast at Tiffany's.  &quot;A House of Flowers,&quot; read like a short story influenced by  Garcia Marquez or Borges.

I did not feel any sympathy for these jacked-up characters and when someone finally got their scalp ripped off and their spine crushed, I merely felt relief that this was one less pathetic personality I had to  keep track of. The dialog was as vapid as the intelligence of the lead  character, Sara Morgan, who has an IQ of about room temperature and  performs the expected Dumb-Damsel moves that makes for typical schlock  suspense. (Oh gosh, can Liam really, really be so bad? Golly, Gee!)

Dick captures the ethos of both the Japanese and German cultures. Taking from both peoples-- their good and the bad qualities-- he creates a future that is eerily familiar. He describes the Germans as  &quot;driven by some desperate sub-conscience archetype....their egos  expanded psychotically so that they cannot tell where they begin and the  godhead leaves off.&quot; That succinctly sums up the Nazi thirst! The  psychological, religious and political insights surrounding the jewelry,  expressed great insight from Dick about the nature of the conquered and the  conqueror. The speculation of the U.S. being overrun by Japanese culture is  not so far removed from current reality. I read this during lunch hours at  the Sony Corporation surrounded by inscrutable and ambiguous Japanese;  always speaking in the Mother tongue so as to obscure the directives from  the Home Islands. Childen, in his relationship with Tagomi and Paul,  suffered Place-consciousness and always struggled to hear the real  conversation veiled beneath the spoken one. Childen experienced how very  low the Rice Paper ceiling is, and while it is lighter than the American  Glass variety, it is infinitely more impenetrable. Many passages in this  book read like a contemporary documentary.	1999-03-05

I very much liked the image of the catcher who keeps those kids from falling over a crazy cliff. But I had to wade through a lot of slag to find that gem. The problem is that Holden is such an unsympathetic character.  He's a rich, East coast WASP who has been given several opportunities for a  free education. How does he respond? Well, he can't apply himself because  everyone is too phony. Hell, Holden could find phoniness lurking in a fruit  bowl. What passes for tragedy in Holden's life? Losing his fencing team's  foils on the subway or discovering that a seedy hotel also has seedy  clientele. How can you care what happens to a character like  this?<br />Perhaps, if Holden was freed from his parent's economic bondage he  could finally toss off those golden manacles; become homeless and head  downtown for the free eats; stand in a soup line three times a day and  finally get hit with some Freakin Real! I hate Holden, Catcher and all, I  really do.	1999-03-03

But Salinger is certainly not the American Borges as some have claimed. John Cheever, Richard Yates, Sherwood Anderson; these were great short story writers. The attraction is to read  these stories for some hints about the Glass family. I find something  disturbing about this family or more on target, the reaction of readers to  the Glass family. Seymour could clip his toenails and readers would find in  this activity some symbolic comment on The Eight Fold Path or, perhaps, the  essence of Zen in the manner Seymour tosses the clippings into an ashtray.  Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Sometimes you don't like a story because  it's weak and not because you missed the East-Salinger Symbolism.<br />I found  it amusing that all nine stories repeatedly used cigarettes as plot  propellants. Was J. D. under grant from Lucky Strikes? Whenever Salinger  wants you to know he's about to be prophetic he uses a cigarette as a  harbinger of the coming epiphany. His characters handle cigarettes, smoke  them, and move ashtrays about and, on two occasions, even handle the  contents of the ashtrays. A cigarette can be a great prop, but not for nine  straight stories.	1999-03-03

Lamb stands Depression  up on its feet, kicks it in front of a mirror and allows us to look back at  the reflected abyss shown in the mind, actions and body of Dolores. When  Dolores hears about whales dying in Wellfleet she heads there in a cab  which makes no sense unless you understand how depression can warp your  sanity. Severely depressed people crave self-negation and behave so ugly  that it makes you sick to love them. Depression (Dolores) is ugly - Lamb  describes it, captures it, even allows you as the reader to suffer it along  with Dolores. If you can't handle it then go back to TV's Baywatch, but  don't put the slam on the Lamb because he didn't waft soft sunshine puffs  against your teary cheeks to lighten it all up.	1998-09-03

Gaines reigns in his  writing so it never lets out the anger, frustration and disillusionment  that the characters carry. I wanted so much for Grant to explode, do  something brass and big and even after the fight scene, I was still waiting  for release. And that's when I realized how well crafted and artful an  author Gaines is. Gaines made me FEEL what Grant felt his whole life, what  Grant's people and community felt; a hungry anger that can never be sated.  I felt this anger so clearly that when I closed the book I felt as though I  had in some way fulfilled Grant's desire of getting out of that town and  going somewhere better.	1998-08-26

The disadvantage to such economy is that you don't get all the details and  that will upset some readers, the advantage; however, is that you don't get  a bloated 600 pager that showcases the author's command of the Oxford  English Dictionary. And THAT is refreshing.<br />I love how Danticat weaves  Haitian folklore into her story. She gives you a feel for the soul of the  Haitian people; their mettle and their pain. I became furious when a coal  vendor was beaten for no reason other than a lust for cruelty by the  soldiers and I fought back a tight throat and stinging eyes during the  deliciously sad ending.<br />Let Danticat tell you a story and see if you too  find wings in the telling.	1998-08-25
