While I dont have a problem with either topic, I was looking for Bill's popular political bites and there is plenty of material out there for that topic.  To my mind he missed the boat on this one.	2005-08-14

I am giving this book 5 stars not because it is a literary classic but because it is one of the best of its genre.  I am not going to rehash the story here as that is available elsewhere.  However, having read all of this series of books, I can honestly say that this is the best one so far.  I have thoroughly enjoyed all of them but this one kept me on the edge of my seat  While all of them deal with horiffic crimes and a touch of the supernatural, this one has truly gruesome tales of murder especially those involving children and more than a little touch of the supernatural.  I read it in one sitting and enjoyed every page and I'll bet you will too.  Worth the price and a definite \\"get away from it all read\\".	2005-08-08

Once in about every ten years a book comes along that totally mesmerizes, this is that book!  A book about \\"Dracula\\"?  Yes but it is way more than that.  I cant imagine the research that went into this book.  It is beautifully written and flows like good music.  I admit I tend to skip over descriptive items in many books but not in this one.  The beauty and thoroughness of the descriptions of the many sites all over Europe took me along and made me feel as if I were there and wanted to stay.  The plot was very different from what you might expect and I loved the fleshed out characters.  This book is beautiful, mysterious and thrilling.  I look forward with great anicipation to additional books by this author.  In the case of some lesser reviews, all I can say is \\"pearls before swine\\".  For a change the professional reviewers got it right \\"This is the Book of the Summer\\" <br />	2005-06-20

Contrary to what some reviewers have said, I like the familiarity with the characters and I also like the growth and development of the characters.  This book was interesting with unexpected plotlines.  Usually by the 5th book in a series, plots tend to become a rehash of the same old thing.  However, with this Armstrong's books, it goes beyond what has gone before in new and surprising ways.  The development of the supernatural worlds is always enjoyable.  I dont expect Faulkner or Hemmingway when I read an Armstrong book, I expect fun and pleasure and that is what I find always.	2005-06-06

However, it would have come to life much better with color photos.  This is especially true of the before and after shots.

But, frankly poor Harry didnt really seem to have a life until this episode.  He may have lots of power as a wizard and certainly lots of adventure in dealing with the \\"dark side\\", but something was definitely missing.  As a dog lover myself I was delighted at the addition of \\"Mouse\\", not to mention Thomas the vampire.  I liked Mouse immediately as a puppy with attitude.  Somehow these additions provide a needed softening of Harry's edges and relieve some of the depression and dissatisfaction at the end of the other stories.  I am also happy about the further rounding out of Murphy's character and the underlying possibilities between her and Harry. <br /> <br />I hope all of this means further continuation of the stories and further developments of the characters.  I enjoyed this book the best of the six I have read so far and am looking forward anxiously to new additions to the series.	2004-08-17

In fairness to all concerned, I read this book as I have read others on the same subject.  Sorry, it smelled from a block away.  This type of political smear is all too typical of GW and we have all seen it used before from Daddy on down.  Those who have been subject to this type of thing have all testified as to it's effectiveness unfortunately e.g. John McCain/Max Clellan. <br /> <br />Come on people, wake up and express your disgust with the kind of politics this books represents.

I was surprised to see so many negative, or on the negative side reviews of this book.  I loved almost every page and have ordered all of the rest of Mr. Sellars' books as well.<BR>I love police procedurals ala Patricia Cornwell and I love books with a touch of the supernatural ala the Jim Butcher series.  Being able to combine the two just proved to be a delight.  Okay so the book could have used some editing but I still loved every minute of it.  I just finished this one and am half way through the second book in the series.  I intend to read them all and dont intend to quibble over small flaws.  I found the writing to be tight, the characters to be likeable and not much wasted time.<br />Mr Sellars is a good representative of his religion/craft and I found myself asking how likely any of these skills are.  But in the end didnt care as I was in it for the ride.  And quite a ride it was.  Am enjoying digging into the next book in the series and am only happy there are still two more to go after that.	2004-06-14

This is the best and most enjoyable book series I have read in many years.  It has all of the elements I most value in a book to &quot;just enjoy&quot;.  I have learned to love all of the recurring characters from Molena Point and especially the four legged variety.  These books are comfortable to read, fun, presenting a good mystery and most surprising of all they are well written without all of the usual cliches and juvenile writing that usually accompanies this genre.  I am utterly devestated that I have come to this last book (so far) in the series.  Trust me you too will love these books and the mysteries they present not to mention that touch of supernatural phenomenon that makes them truly extraordinary.  I have always been more of a dog lover myself but have found a new awareness of cat psychology from an author who truly knows and understands cats.  Don't miss this series whatever you do!	2003-02-08

What a wonderful day when a new series of books is found which guarantees hours of reading pleasure ahead.  such is the case with this delightful mystery series.  I have just completed two of the books and am totally delighted.  Cat on the Edge was my first and I unexpectedly loved it and had to have the rest of the series.  I am more of a dog person but loved these cats!  The author obviously knows cats well as Joe and Dulcie behave exactly as you would expect a cat to behave except......they find themselves having human feelings about various situations, and the ability to talk, read and understand human speech.  Add mystery and murder to all of the above and you have a delightful, light reading adventure.  I felt like the characters in this book were old friends when finished reading and could hardly wait to begin reading their next adventure.	2003-01-13

It has been a while since I read anything I truly could not put down but this book delivers.  The characters were well developed and varied in their personalities and approaches.  A little romance, lots of thrills and chills and page after page of nail biting suspense.  I particularly like strong women heroines, which Maggie O'Dell certainly is but she is also vulnerable and flawed just enough to be human and likeable.  The other female roles are excellent and totally different from each other; the strong, worldly Tess is a pleasure to root for in her confrontation with evil.  Would like to see more of this character in subsequent novels.  All in all a thoroughly good mystery.  I hope to see many more of the Maggie O'Dell novels.  Would highly recommend this novel to anyone who likes thrills, chills and a rollicking good story.	2002-07-09

It is the first book in a long time that I could absolutely not put down until it was finished.  The action and tension was on every page so at no time did it get boring.  I loved the lost city, the monster, the Indian lore and everything else about it right from the first page.  Just cant express how much I enjoyed this book.  I sincerely hope that Owl Goingback continues to write lots more along the same lines.	2002-06-19

I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Having read all of the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter books, I was sick of so much gore, detailed sex and descriptive paragraphs about various bodily fluids.  I picked this book up to try and was immediately delighted.  It was just what I needed.....light, fun, and yet with a mystery to solve and a romance to encourage.  I love the main characters in Sookie and her vamp boyfriend Bill.  they seem so normal to be so ummm shall we say unusual.  Sookie is truly a girl who is open minded and non-discriminating.  She is also funny, sexy, and not nearly as air-headed as her friends and neighbors of a lifetime would like to think.  I would highly recommend this book, especially to those who need a relief from the heavier tales.  This is just right!!	2002-06-11

You never get the feeling that they are thinking, &quot;well this is just another fright book so lets not bother to be too literate about it&quot;.  They write well and do not write &quot;down&quot;. The Cabinet of Curiousities was certainly an unusual topic and a fresh one.  While most of their books have a touch of the supernatural or a monster or two, you can still learn a lot about many of the sciences as you enjoy the read.  My big problem is slipping to the last page and spoiling the read itself, which is what I did here.  However, that said I would highly recommend anythig written by these guys.  Just DON'T read the last pages first!	2002-06-04

I have read all of the books in the Anita Blake Vampir3e Hunter series.  Each book had a new twist and a different type of enemy for Anita to face. However, I have noticed that with each book the sex gets kinkier and the emphasis on bodily fluids has become grosser and more prevalent to the point of disgust.  While I have liked most of the books in the series, this one was over the top and I have not been able to finish it and dont know if I will.  I have just found I no longer care about the characters or their over the top relationships.  I hope that if Ms. Hamilton continues the series, she will revert back to the things that made the books special; the different monsters and the mystery of finding and destroying them.  Enough already with the sex and messier aspects of the stories.	2002-06-03

This book had me totally spellbound from beginning to end.  The characters work well together and the addition of a new character was a real plus. I felt the fear of the victims down to my toes.  And wanted to see the nemisis, shall we say neutralized, as badly as the characters.  A good read indeed!	2002-03-22

A couple of months ago I began Laurell Hamilton's \\"Guilty Pleasures\\".  At first it was a bit of a turnoff.  It seemed immensely dark and the sexual overtones seemed almost perverted.  However, I picked it back up later and began to get further involved.  I found that I enjoyed the book and really became involved in the \\"adventure\\" of it all.  My opinion slowly began to change until I was fully caught up in the dangers the heroine, \\"Anita Blake\\" constantly faced.  It was such a relief to find a heroine who was not constantly screaming and hoping for rescue but who rescued herself.  I enjoyed the book enough to pick up several more books in the series.  I have enjoyed getting acquainted with the continuing cast of characters.  Ms Blake has a very imaginative approach to the supernatural, just a bit different than most, and all of the \\"supernaturas\\" are not entirely evil.  A good book to read with a cup of hot chocolate while it rains outside.	2002-02-11

While there was much I did enjoy about the book, there were some things that make me unsure if I will or will not add it to my list of favorites.  I very much enjoyed the adventure, the danger and the strength of the female heroine.  In general, the book was a bit dark and kinky for my taste.  However, be that as it may, there was enough about this book that I found enjoyable that I have ordered other books in the series.  I have the feeling that this series cannot be judged by just one book and I am more than willing to give it a fair shot.	2002-02-01

Words like cozy, charming and delightful come to mind easily.  It was the perfect book for a rainy Fall afternoon.  I only got up from my chair once to get a cup of tea and stir the fire.  Yes, it is that kind of book.  It has all of the elements, likeable characters, an English cottage, a benevolent ghost, the much loved English mystery...sort of...and a touch of romance.

When Mr Rollins' new book arrived, I was in the process of finishing another book, however, my eye kept wandering over to Deep Fathom.  Finally had to give in and start reading and didn't stop till I was finished.  Mr Rollins gets better with each book he writes.

Katherine Kurtz' tales of the Knights Templar have always been my favorites and when she says &quot;she can't leave them alone&quot; she proves it in this book by managing to incorporate a bit of their legend.  I would highly recommend this delight of a book for anyone looking for a pleasurable day of light reading.  The ending leaves us to wonder if more books in this genre may be forthcoming.

The basic premise of bringing together mystery/supernatural experts in a turn of the century environment is wonderful.  However, the  remainder of the book is nothing more than a rehashing of old tales.  Not  enough advantage was taken of the original premise and it would have been  far more interesting to use newly created mysterious occult tales and  involve the legendary solvers more directly.  I was very disappointed in  this book but have high hopes that Ms. Michaels' next book will be more up  to the standards of previous novels such as &quot;Ammie Come Home&quot; and  &quot;To Be Buried in the Rain&quot;.	1999-02-18
