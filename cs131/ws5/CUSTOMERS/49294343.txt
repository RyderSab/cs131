This book confirmed something that I've felt all along:  Hillary and Bill Clinton are true and tireless public servants.  On an instinctual level, I always liked the Clintons despite the fact that media coverage of them seemed to dwell inordinately on false accusations leveled at them.  Despite a constant onslaught of attacks from their political opponents during eight very successful years in the White House, the Clintons devoted themselves to doing as much good for as many people possible.  <br />Though there are a few dryer moments where Senator Clinton delves into great detail about her travels as First Lady, Whitewater, or healthcare issues, the overall tone of the book is personal, inviting, and generous. It was as if a friend of mine had grown up to become a First Lady and a Senator and wanted to share the marvel of it without glossing over her personal challenges or darker moments during the journey.  The book is filled with events in the lives of a President and First Lady, but despite the power of their positions, I soon felt so connected to the Clintons that I started to think and talk about them as Hillary and Bill.  One paragraph about Hillary's response to people asking why she is still married to Bill is poignant, powerful, and unforgettable.  <br />I cannot remember the last time I read anything that made me feel excited about serving one's country in the political realm.  I learned that Hillary's competence in the world of law and politics did not spring up overnight, but grew from a long dedication to public service and an unwavering commitment to issues such as healthcare and women's rights. Hilary's insights are often very simple, with a  profound universal appeal:  \\"One of the most important lessons I learned during my years as First Lady was how dependent the affairs of state and the policies of nations are on the personal relationships among leaders.  Even ideologically opposed countries can reach agreements and forge alliances if their leaders know and trust one another.  But this sort of diplomacy requires constant nurturing and informal dialogue among the principals, which is one reason why the President, vice President and I took frequent trips overseas.\\"<br />As you read this book, you will travel with Hillary through an awe-inspiring story that includes Watergate, marriage, Whitewater, parenting, Africa, the Middle East, Washington DC, and friendships, to name a few.  If Hillary's story is one of successes, it is even more a story of courage and persistence through the personal choices she has made.  One of the most enduring messages in the book comes from what Hilary tells us Nelson Mandela said to her and  her husband:  \\"the greatest glory of living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time you fall.\\"<br />This is a book about going for excellence in one's life.  If you are interested in nurturing excellence in your life as well as in the lives of those around you, I recommend another brilliant book:  \\"WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK,\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane.  In a book written simply from the heart, the Kanes make the practice of living a full and rewarding life accessible to everyone.	2003-07-21

This is a beautiful and gentle book about experiencing the great being that<BR>you really are.  In the course of this self-discovery, Ruiz points out that<BR>we need to become aware of how trained our minds have become to suffering.<BR>Once we recognize where we are using our minds to diminish our sense of<BR>well-being, we have a choice in letting go of destructive behaviors.<br />I particularly enjoyed the chapter called, \\"The Dream Master.\\"  Ruiz<BR>describes our life as a dream.  Before we learn to master this dream, we<BR>live in a Dream of Fear that enslaves us in a perpetual cycle of suffering.<BR>To master the dream, we must begin with ourselves - we must be completely<BR>honest with ourselves.  When we tell ourselves the truth about what we like<BR>and dislike in our circumstances, we have a choice to follow those things<BR>that feed our happiness and to let go of those things that put us in pain.<BR>As we discover how to see things as they are without getting lost in our<BR>reactions and our minds' interpretations of what we see, we become Dream<BR>Masters.  Through awareness of our experience of life, we recover our free<BR>will:  \\"Becoming aware is about being responsible for your own life.\\"<br />In my own experience, I have found awareness to be an inexplicably powerful<BR>tool for living fully and passionately.  An excellent book that nurtures<BR>one's ability to live with awareness is \\"Working on Yourself  Doesn't Work\\"<BR>by Ariel and Shya Kane.  The authors' presence in this book is clear,<BR>compassionate, and truly compelling.  I recommend it as an excellent<BR>companion to Ruiz's book and wish you well in your self-discovery.	2003-01-21

Every now and again, a book comes along to remind us of how simple life is<BR>and how complicated we make it with our minds.  In \\"The Power of Now\\",<BR>Eckhart Tolle converses with his readers about what it is to shift from a<BR>thought-based and time-based view of life to a being-based life.  It's a<BR>simple idea:  there is no moment but now, and when you get into this<BR>moment of now, the past and future have no power over you.  If a mental<BR>grasp of this concept could get people into the present  and keep them<BR>there forever, we'd have a lot more enlightened people on the planet.  To<BR>that point, when a student in the book tries to insist that the past and<BR>future are real, Tolle replies: \\"You  haven't yet grasped the essence of<BR>what I am saying because you are trying to understand it mentally. The<BR>essence of what I am saying here cannot be understood by the mind.  The<BR>moment you grasp it, there is a shift in consciousness from mind to Being,<BR>from time to presence.   Suddenly, everything feels alive, radiates<BR>energy, emanates  Being.\\"<br />What people can do, Tolle suggests, is to practice getting into the now -<BR>by feeling what's happening in their bodies, by noticing their own<BR>thoughts without holding them as true.  Everything that is precious about<BR>life is in the Now.  Eckhart's presence is powerful and palpable in this<BR>book.  As I read it, I felt worries and concerns about things I can't<BR>control just drop away.  I can't explain this phenomenon, but as Tolle<BR>says, the mind can't hold the moment.  The daily practice of being present<BR>is key, since each day brings new challenges to remaining centered.	2002-11-22

I found Caroline Myss'  \\"SACRED CONTRACTS\\" to be a warm and insightful guide to investigating one's purpose in life.  Myss writes with a great generosity of heart.  She describes her book as \\"a product of my wanting to share with people my insights about our individual and collective life purpose over nearly two decades of working with the energies of the human spirit.\\"  Myss explores the idea of archetypes, or energies, that are aspects of our personalities intricately involved in the fulfilling of our purposes.<br />The book functions as a guide to help you identify the key archetypes in your life, so that rather than getting lost in the drama of your life, you can step back and experience yourself as more centered in the big picture.  The tone is light and often playful, and Myss sprinkles her discussions with many gems, such as:  \\"real creativity is based on a solid foundation of knowledge and discipline.\\"  Her chapter on the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" as a symbol of personal transformation is moving and mesmerizing.  I had never considered the difference Dorothy made to the lives of the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Lion before I read this chapter.  Myss repeatedly underlines the importance of living in the moment:  \\"Fulfilling your highest potential actually means acting on your highest or deepest truth each moment of your life.\\"  As an excellent companion book on your road to personal growth, I strongly recommend \\"WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane.  (Their audio CD's and tapes are brilliant as well.)  This simple and practical book is an indispensable guide to living fully in the moment and discovering joy and satisfaction with a consistency beyond your wildest imagination.	2002-10-02

Based on extensive research done by Gallup (the polling organization), NOW, DISCOVER YOUR STRENGTHS is about developing human strengths instead of trying to improve weaknesses.  The authors begin by making a remarkable point:  that people succeed better in their careers when they go with what comes naturally to them instead of trying to develop abilities they are lacking in.  They illustrate their ideas from the point of view of an employee as well as from a management viewpoint.  After a 30-year study including interviews with over 2 million people, the authors condense the results into a detailed description of 34 strengths - patterns or themes that can contribute to your personal and professional success.  They provide a website where you can take their online strengths test, and they stress the fact that it is not the type of test you fail.  It is more about observing yourself without judgment.   <br />The tone of the book is good-natured and encouraging:  \\"Spontaneous reaction, yearnings, rapid learning, and satisfactions will all help you detect the traces of your talents.\\"  One of the most valuable things I read in the book was how often people are reluctant to build on their own strengths because mediocrity and failure are so much less risky.  I encourage anyone attracted to this book's ability to present new possibilities for your life to read a copy of WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK by Ariel and Shya Kane.  The Kanes are masters in the art of showing people how to transform possibilities undreamt of into everyday realities.	2002-08-24

If you've noticed that you often have useless thoughts about things you can't control, Byron Katie's \\"Loving What Is\\" could be the book for you.  Katie lays out a process she calls the \\"Work,\\" four questions that can facilitate your release from problems that flood your thought processes and dominate your life.  It is a systematic mind-based approach whose cornerstone is an investigation (via the four questions) of whatever ishappening in your life.  Katie emphasizes (through numerous examples with people going through a wide range of life's challenges) that you're either inquiring about your concepts or attaching to them.  She is a rigorous taskmaster in the dialogue she has with each person, leading them to the fourth question in which you turn around a situation.  She calls this \\"turnaround\\" \\"your prescription for health, peace, and happiness.\\"  <br />The goal of the \\"Work\\" is to quiet the mind through inquiry.  When you do that, you can just love whatever is happening in your life instead of fighting it to no avail.  One of my favorite points was about not getting into other people's \\"business,\\" since trying to fix someone else is just a way to keep us in pain.  In another example about a woman at the end of her life in a hospice, Katie points out that your can either live with your life or with the story of your life.<br />Another effortless approach that espouses living your life instead of your thoughts is a beautiful book about the immeasurable power of awareness. Part story and part narrative, it's called \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work,\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane, and I can't recommend it enough for people who are ready to stop being hard on themselves and rediscover life's forgotten magic.	2002-08-09

What a pleasure to read a book that encourages me to just continue being me, with one key suggestion:  that I observe myself without judgment.   Tolle presents this book as a simplified and condensed version of THE POWER OF NOW, his original bestseller.  The tone is simple, gentle, and powerful.  It's all about getting into the moment, where the magic and joy of life reside.  I was very intrigued by Tolle's description of time as something that only exists in the mind, in the past or future. There is no time in the present, he points out, and by leaving the moment, we create more psychological time.  I had never looked at this way.  I also liked his emphasis on reconnecting with oneself by observing the sensations in one's body - this struck a chord with me.  In a world awash with tips on how to get better, it's an immense relief to read something that opens your eyes to how perfect you already are.  I strongly suggest complementing this book with WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK by Ariel and Shya Kane, another excellent publication that actually facilitates you in the day-to-day practice of living in the moment, where passion, satisfaction, and love are unlimited.	2002-05-13

Brian Tracy's \\"Focal Point\\" is a primer in how to achieve one's goals and<BR>simplify one's life.  It is a detailed set of tools to: 1) help you do more<BR>of what works, 2) do less of the things that don't benefit you, 3) do and<BR>learn new things, and 4) eliminate the things that work against you.  What<BR>Tracy brings to his book is a high degree of passion for success and for<BR>tapping into unexplored possibilities.  One simple point he makes early on<BR>is German philosopher Goethe's idea, \\"Everything is hard before it is easy.\\"<BR>I think if people just get that, it could transform their lives.

If you could spend some time with an elder who is passionate <BR>about the topic of how to find meaning in one's life, it would be <BR>Harold S. Kushner.  In his book, &quot;LIVING A LIFE THAT MATTERS,&quot; <BR>Kushner, a rabbi, draws extensively from the Old Testament to <BR>examine the course of one's lifetime as a series of ever-changing <BR>challenges.  He explores greed and generosity, dishonesty and <BR>truthfulness, all the while striving to find the lesson, the kernel of <BR>truth that he can share with his readers to re-affirm that life has a <BR>purpose.  <br />In the end, the &quot;Life that Matters&quot; is one in which we <BR>make a positive difference to others, a life guided by care, <BR>compassion, courage, and faith.

Well, I<br />was wrong.  In his second year at Hogwarts, young wizard Harry Potter meets<br />new challenges as a student, as a friend, and of course, as a hero unaware<br />of his greatness.  New and colorful characters appear, like the flamboyant<br />Professor Lockhart.  Rowling's story continues a lovely parable that pits<br />the lifestyle of wizarding folk against non-wizards, the muggles.  The<br />comparison is between living one's life passionately and heroically versus<br />living a normal life by the book.<br />Since the unfortunate events of last September 11th, I think Harry Potter offers children and adults alike a way<br />to answer the question:  how do I live my life fully and make a difference to others?  If this is a question you find yourself asking, read all the Potter books as well as a beautiful little book by Ariel and Shya Kane called \\"WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK.\\"  The Kanes' book is a clear and simple guide to living a magical life.  I recommend these books because they have touched me.  They demonstrate that we can all be wizards in our own right.	2001-11-12

Most of the text is by Dr.  Cutler, a Western psychiatrist who converses with the Dalai Lama  and then reflects on the conversation.  In the course of the book,  the reader accompanies Dr. Cutler as he grows in his quest to  elucidate the principles of happiness.   Among the many  eye-opening interactions between Cutler and the Dalai Lama is one  in which Dr. Cutler assumes that feeling satisfied with an action  determines its being positive.  The Dalai Lama points out that  &quot;self-satisfaction alone cannot determine if a desire or action is  positive or negative,&quot; but rather that the consequences of an  action or desire determine its being positive or negative.  The  dialogue between Dr. Cutler and the Dalai Lama makes for an  engaging East Meets West interplay.  <br />The persistent theme I found throughout the book is that humans  are essentially good and that compassion for oneself and others is  essential to realizing our potential.  The Dalai Lama says  &quot;Compassion is required in order to activate the seed which is  inherent in our hearts and minds.&quot;  If you're looking for another  excellent perspective on the practice of day-to-day enlightenment,  I wholeheartedly recommend &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane - it has made a great difference in my life.	2001-08-14

Don't let the simplicity of this book overshadow the power of its message:  \\"When the driving force of our actions is wholesome, our actions will tend automatically to contribute to others' well-being.  They will thus automatically be ethical.\\"  With the courage to point out that religion is not a requirement for ethical behavior, the Dalai Dama discusses virtue, compassion, and our spiritual connection to the world.  He does so as a simple and honest man without holding himself as holier than anyone else.  Describing how humans can make a constructive difference on the planet, he appeals to people to tap their highest potential and to go for their personal goodness, despite the social currents that discourage one from doing so.    <br /> This is a book about discovering your ethics rather than just acting out cultural norms.  If you appreciate simplicity of style and communication based on real substance, allow me to also recommend \\"WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane.  In an age of widespread doubt, these two books are refreshing reminders that the principles underlying a fulfilling life are both simple and practical.	2001-06-11

Dan Millman's LIVING ON PURPOSE provides  a clear and simply structured view of what Millman calls &quot;House Rules,&quot; guiding principles for living one's life on purpose rather than by accident.  Each chapter presents a House Rule, then a clarifying summary of the rule, two related question/answers, and a personal exercise page.  I found the tone of the book supportive and compassionate.  The anecdotes are light-hearted and helpful.  Some of the ideas I was particularly struck by include:  &quot;If we wait for the perfect moment to come alive, we may discover that we never lived at all,&quot; and &quot;By paying attention to the present moment, and the next, and the next, we determine the quality of our lives.&quot;<br />LIVING ON PURPOSE gently nudges the reader in the direction of living in the moment.

Want to live your life to the fullest? - start by clearing out all the old stuff that is dragging you down.<br />This book recommends an easy and comprehensive method to clearing out and organizing your house and office.  It advocates looking at how you operate and organize your environment to support you, instead of trying to make you fit into a supposedly better way of living.  i.e. if you scatter your shoes as soon as you walk in the door, just put a shoe rack in the entrance.  Simple, but much more efficient than making yourself wrong for leaving your shoes scattered by your front door!<br />This way of looking at yourself is very profound and has a lot of meaning for me.  I previously read &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane which advocates looking at life and at yourself with a non judgmental awareness, and shows how to live your life to the fullest.

I picked up a copy of Gary  Zukav's &quot;SOUL STORIES&quot; and I'm well on my way.  It's a light collection of  stories and thoughts about living your life from your heart.  Zukav talks  about the &quot;Old Male&quot; (old-fashioned and traditional) and the &quot;New Male&quot;  (uses his intuition and recognizes a new order to things) -- I saw pieces of  myself in both of these!  I particularly enjoyed the chapter in which Zukav  meets Oprah Winfrey -- it's a beautiful demonstration of how easily  cooperation happens and how you never know all the ways in which your dreams and goals will be expressed.<br />     In my wanderings through book reviews, I came upon another excellent  book that supports people in living from their truth --  &quot;WORKING ON  YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK&quot; by best-selling authors Ariel and Shya Kane.

So when I read a review of Don Miguel Ruiz's \\"THE FOUR AGREEMENTS\\" where the reviewer actually said it felt good to read, I knew it was a book for me.  The book is like taking a walk with a compassionate shaman who describes and lives simple truths.  I particularly liked a passage on the third agreement (\\"Don't make assumptions\\") in which Ruiz describes a husband and a wife who fall out of relationship not because they don't love each other, but because they make assumptions such as the other member of the couple should be able to read their mind if they really loved them.  How familiar!  It really underscored the value of truthful communication for me.<br />    The same reviewer also recommended \\"WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane.  This is an excellent book about REALLY living your life fully.  And a perfect example of how the words are secondary to the feeling of well-being that jump off this book's pages.  Thank you, kind reviewer, for two great gifts.	2000-10-24

When I picked up a copy of &quot;MESSAGES FROM THE MASTERS&quot; by Brian  Weiss, I expected lessons from famous prophets and gurus throughout  history. Instead - I discovered a collection of spiritual advice and  anecdotes focusing largely on past-life regression that delivered an  important message:   that we are the masters and that anyone can be an  invaluable teacher in life.  There is a sense of urgency in this book as  Weiss entreats the reader to be gentler on himself, to see life as a means  of learning the lessons we need to grow, and to see that we are all love.   By relaxing the mind, Weiss tells us, we can become aware of who we are, of  how powerful we are.<br />In my own life, I have found awareness to be the  key, and another excellent book on the subject which I very highly  recommend is another bestseller called &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T  WORK&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane.   A truly magical life is possible and  both these books are excellent guides to discover it for yourself.	2000-09-09

Gary Zukav's \\"Seat of the Soul\\" is a treatise on the empowerment of one's  soul.  Zukav discusses really living one's life rather than seeking the  approval of others.  He deeply emphasizes developing a reverence for all  life.  I think the following quote from the book is an eloquent  distillation of his message:  \\"When the energy of the soul is recognized,  acknowledged, and valued, it begins to infuse the life of the personality.   When the personality comes fully to serve the energy of its soul, that is  authentic empowerment.\\"  Through anecdotes and discussion, Zukav suggests  that we become intimate with our emotions, since they affect our  intentions.  He also stresses that we are here to learn lessons, creating  situations for ourselves that bring us face-to-face with what we need to  learn most.  He writes at length about intuition, compassion,  responsibility, and power.  \\"You lose power when you fear\\" he explains, and  suggests that we cultivate feeling what is happening in our bodies rather  than follow our thoughts about those feelings.  If you are touched by his  message and the power of awareness in our lives, I suggest you grab a copy  of \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane.  I've read  many books that have pointed the way to a great life, but this one went  right to the heart of the matter - that trying to fix yourself keeps you  stuck in the places you'd like get out of, but getting into the moment will  set you free.   Enjoy these books!	2000-08-24

I think the maze is  an appropriate image because it suggests that we don't know our course and  can find triumphs and upsets at any turn.  It also emphasizes that our not  liking the way things show up won't make a difference, but that adapting  and creating new solutions will make life more fun and a lot easier.    Johnson prescribes going forward with intuitive hunches despite the  ever-present fear of change in our lives.   I'm glad I read the book and  that I followed a reviewer's suggestion  to read another book as well:   \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane.  I've read many  books that have pointed the way to a great life, but this one went right to  the heart of the matter - that trying to fix yourself keeps you stuck in  the places you'd like get out of, but getting into the moment will set you  free.   Don't miss either of these books.	2000-08-21

One of the reviews of &quot;Working on Yourself Doesn't Work&quot; by  Ariel and Shya Kane pointed me to an audio tape by the Kanes called  &quot;Magical Relationships.&quot; What a treat! After meeting the authors  through their book, I got to actually hear them talking with people in a  seminar. They are brilliant with people, really listening to each question  and comment that arises from the audience and giving everything they've got  with their responses. Listening to the tape was like spending time with two  compassionate friends (and their guests!) who have discovered magic in  their lives. I felt very close to one of the participants who talked about  how embarrassing it can be to feel her partner's love for her. It's a great  section, but I won't give any more away. You don't have to dream about  having an awesome life. Get the book, get the tape, and celebrate - the  Kanes are a gift!	2000-08-21

Lance Armstrong's \\"It's Not About the Bike\\" resonates with the boundless,  Tour de France-winning energy of its author.  Armstrong tells his story  with honesty and simplicity in a way that made me want to hear and know  more, and not shrink back from the details of  what it's like to have  testicular cancer.   As he talked about the person he was before and after  fighting cancer,  I could feel the post-cancer Lance emerge in the book - a  person who woke up to what a difference people make in our lives, and what  a difference we make to other people and to ourselves.  I really like the  following quote from the book:  \\"The one thing the illness has convinced me  of beyond all doubt --more than any experience I`ve had as an athlete--is  that we are much better than we know.\\"<br /> I owe a great thanks to a  reviewer of this book from Jersey City.  The review spurred me on to read  this book as well as another book she recommended \\"Working on Yourself  Doesn't Work\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane.  I've read many books that have  pointed the way to a great life, but this one went right tothe heart of the  matter - that trying to fix yourself keeps you stuck in the places you'd  like get out of, but getting into the moment will set you free.

While  it's based on a college graduation speech, its appeal is really to anyone  open to advice about work and personal relationships.  My favorite chapter  was \\"Your Behavior Has Consequences\\" because . Shriver takes an honest look  at getting \\"your gut to talk ethics to you.\\"   It's about personal  integrity in environments that practically beg you to bend your principles.   Shriver uses examples from her own life, citing mistakes she's made, and  successes she's had in the area of living with integrity.  I got the  feeling that someone who had been down certain roads was willing to lend me  a hand in being true to myself.  I was inspired that she stressed letting  go of the past and getting on with what's present in your life.<br />    To  readers interested in discovering a fuller life,  I highly recommend  \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane.  This book is  for anyone who wants to live each day with self-expression, satisfaction   and love.  Many books have pointed the way for me, but this one went right  to the heart of the matter - that trying to fix yourself keeps you stuck in  the places you'd like to be free of, but getting into the moment will set  you free.  Just in reading and re-reading the book, I've found myself  falling into the space of living in the moment and my life has become  easier.  This book is truly a gift.	2000-08-07

The  first person is Morrie Schwartz,  who used the process of his death to  instill in people an urgency about living fully and truthfully, not just  mechanically according to the dictates of one's culture.  The second person  is Mitch Albom, who recreates his experience of Morrie so vividly that I  feel as if I gained a friend in Morrie and suffered a deep loss in his  death.   Albom lets us feel his heart in the story so honestly that  something in me relaxed around the discomfort with the topic of death.  And  while I really like the wisdom that Morrie imparted to Mitch, what stays  with me is the passion for life that Morrie had - it is palpable and  contagious.  If you catch it, it could heal something in you.<br />    To  readers interested in discovering a fuller life,  I highly recommend  \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane.  This book is  for anyone who wants to live each day with self-expression, satisfaction   and love.

It's a handy-sized book with short chapters (1-3 pages) that are clear and crisp.   I got the feeling that the author cares about people and is really excited  about sharing the things that have made his life fuller.  My favorite  chapter was #15: \\"Remind Yourself that Your Life Begins Now.\\"  Carlson  reminds the reader that  the past holds no power over our present UNLESS we  give it power.  \\"Operate as if all the power in your life begins and ends  in this moment.\\"<br />I have found that living in the present really does  provide me with an inexplicable level of satisfaction and well-being which  go hand in hand with abundance.  The idea is daunting to the mind, but if  you're really curious about living fully after reading this book, then grab  a copy of \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work, a Book About Instantaneous  Transformation,\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane.  This book is about having a  magnificent life and nothing less. The three principles of transformation  the Kanes talk about touched me so profoundly that I HAVE discovered my own  magnificence. No kidding! Just by being in the moment, life becomes  magical.	2000-07-07

Eckhardt Tolle's \\"The Power of Now\\" is a compelling book about getting into the moment and accessing the power that resides there.  Tolle talks about pain and suffering as functions of the mind that we can let go of.  I  was struck by so many passages, including this one:  \\"So the single most  vital step on your journey toward enlightenment is this:  learn to  disidentify from your mind.  Every time you creat a gap in the stream of  mind, the light of your consciousness grows stronger.\\"  What I like here is  that the words themselves are both intriguing and resonant with an  inexplicable truth.  By saying yes to your life, to this moment, Tolle  explains your life will start working for you rather than against  you.<br />The book is written as a question and answer conversation with  Tolle, who converses clearly, patiently, and with compassion.  I highly  recommend this book - it can make a huge difference in your life!<br />Tolle  also points out  that while only you can bring yourself into the now,  finding someone who is intensely conscious and joining them in the state of  presence can accelerate things.  So I'd like to recommend a book by a  couple I've experienced as master trainers in getting into the moment.   It  is Ariel and Shya Kane's \\"Working of Yourself Doesn't Work:  A Book About  Instantaneous Transformation.\\"  This book is about having a magnificent  life and nothing less.  And while it seems too good to be true, I found  that the  three principles of transformation  the Kanes talk about touched  me so profoundly that I HAVE discovered my own magnificence.  No kidding!   Just by being in the moment, life becomes magical.  By becoming aware of  the mechanical behaviors that keep us out of the moment, we regain our  original freedom.  Read this book and the presence of the Kanes will seep  through and you'll feel how true and powerful their words are, and how  deeply they care about people and about the often-missed  possibility of  living with immeasurable joy, wellness, nourishing relationships, and  satisfaction.   And if you're ever in New York City, check out their  seminars - they are miraculous.	2000-06-29

What a great book!   \\"The Four Agreements\\" flows with a simplicity and honesty that caught my attention.  I came away from this book feeling more at ease in myself.  Perhaps the most powerful passage in the book for me  was \\"Death is not the biggest fear we have;  our biggest fear is taking the  risk to be alive -- the risk to be alive and express what we really are.\\"    I hadn't looked at this idea before, and when I checked with myself I found  it to be true.  Miguel Ruiz's book does a great job of describing the  process through which we lose sight of our true selves.  After that, Ruiz  outlines the four agreements you can make with yourself to have a  fulfilling life.  They are simple and powerful and they can make a a great  difference in the quality of your life.<br />Gladly enough, when I found this  book on Amazon and read the reviews to check it out, I saw a review for  another book which I bought as well.   It is Ariel and Shya Kane's \\"Working  of Yourself Doesn't Work:  A Book About Instantaneous Transformation.\\"   This book is about having a magnificent life and nothing less.  And while  it seems too good to be true, I found that the  three principles of  transformation  the Kanes talk about touched me so profoundly that I HAVE  discovered my own magnificence.

My work is  easier and I feel more connected to the people in my life.
