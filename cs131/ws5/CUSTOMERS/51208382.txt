It would have been a great story but for the CONSTANT INTERRUPTION of a narrator setting the next scene. It was so distracting I lost interest for the entire story! I never want to listen to a story told like this. It was almost painful to listen to. I barely got through tape 1 before I packed it up to give to my local library. This was a total waste of my money.	2005-08-11

This was a total waste of my money. There were too many characters to follow and too many details about them. I  was so confused with all of the characters that I never really understood the story. Very disappointing.	2004-09-27

There were too many characters to keep track of. At times the story was totally confusing. It jumps around, the conversations among the characters was very hard to follow, and most of the time would leave you in left field! Save your money on this one.	2004-08-20
