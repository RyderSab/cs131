It was only coincidence that every Alien civilization we encountered was so advanced beyond the civilizations of Earth that we looked like pathetic savages scrabbling in the dirt by comparison. And I know that in time we will begin to come upon worlds whose peoples are far behind or at best equal to ours. It is impossible for Earth to be the most backward inhabited planet in the known universe. However all of us at the top knew what would happen if the apparent skew toward Alien superiority were to become known to the Terran populations. That way lay hysteria and panic, or worse; that way lay the fate of the dinosaurs. The policy of total deception was implemented at the highest levels, with the fullest understanding that anyone showing the smallest sign of potential for betraying the situation would be killed at once; there would be no exceptions, not even in the White House.

Damiano muttered something that was a bit profane. &quot;The problem isn't in your hand at all. It's here,&quot; said Damiano's teacher, and he laid his ivory hand on the young man's right shoulder. Damiano turned his head in surprise, his coarse black ringlets trailing over the fair skin of that hand. He shifted within his winter robe, which was colored like a tarnished brass coin and heavy as coins. The color suited Damiano, whose complexion was rather more warm than fair. &quot;My shoulder is tight?&quot; Damiano asked, knowing the answer already. He sighed and let his arm relax. His fingers slid limply across the yew-wood face of the liuto that lay propped on his right thigh. The sleeve of the robe, much longer than his arm and banded in scarlet, toppled over his wrist. He flipped the cloth up with a practiced, unconsdous movement that also managed to toss his tangle of hair back from his face. Damiano's hand, arm, and shoulder were slim and loosely jointed, as was the rest of him. 'Again?&quot; he continued. &quot;I thought I had overcome that tightness months ago.&quot; His eyes and eyelashes were as soft and black as the woolen mourning cloth that half the women of the town wore, and his eyes grew even blacker in his discouragement. He sighed once more. Raphael's grip on the youth tightened. He shook him gently, laughing, and drew Damiano against him. &quot;You did. And you will overcome it again and again.	2000-09-24

Damiano knew her powers as well, having hoth suffered them and stolen them. But now all the strength was hers and he had none at all. Damiano felt himself step closer to the witch, though he did not know how he did it, not having a body with which to step. &quot;I knew you would come at last, Dami&quot; said Saara softly. &quot;Part of your soul is waiting here.&quot; He reached out one doomed, immaterial hand. &quot;Saara,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Pikku Saara.

The author's ability to bring to vivid life the general background of this period of history, and yet interweave it with the type of fantasy which was actually accepted in that day of positive faith is truly amazing.

Plangent water reflected the little green leaves of the willow, including even the tiny round crystals of dew which hung from the leaves, with only artistic distortion, while below the line of the water cool fish brooded, wearing coats of bright enamelwork. On either side of the stream a lawn spread out, tended by cloudy sheep. Other beasts, too, roamed at their graceful will across the landscape: the ox and the wide-horned aurochs, the slouching camelopard, the corkindrill-each animal as fat as a burgher and similarly complacent. None were ragged, none scarred. None raised its elegant head except in wonder at the sweetuess of the air. Of course there were birds, and even in the lacv mass of the willow they sang, regardless of the presence of two or three sleek and platter-faced cats who meditated while resting upon the largest branches, their white, gray, or manystriped tails curled below them like fishhooks trolling the air. Although there were aurochs and a camelopard, and it has been said that these are wary beasts and unsocial, this park which contained them had not the appearance of wilderness. Beyond the copse of fruiting trees on the far side of the river rose a white palace of intricate shape and exquisite proportion, though through distance and the balmy air its exact lineaments were confused. Another more homey sort of house tose closer to hand, on the bank of the stream itself This edifice was square, three stories tall, and also white-sparkling white-except for a roof of red tile and certain tasteful borders of red and gold about the windows.	2000-09-24

Protect themselves against the chance that some enemy up there had something to answer the tanks: a general in Hell never assumed anything, and lasers and disruptors and tactical nukes were always a possibility.

Cleopatra was shouting orders of her own, snatching up equipage and personal belongings and wreckage and shoving them at an orderly while legionaries struck the tent they had been sleeping in.

And indeed, his power  brokering, love of glamour; controversy, and notoriety made him, in the  end, one of the most influential men in our society. From his role in the  Rosenbergs' trial and as chiefcounsel to Senator Joseph McCarthy during the  Senate hearings through his extraordinary friendship with J. Edgar Hoover  and his own vendetta against Robert Kennedy, Cohn's reputation built. But  his unique practice of law and power brokering was most notorious outside  the courtroom. His unprecedented track record and his sensational and  shocking behavior drew the rich and the powerful to him to solve their  problems. His clients ranged from media barons to members of organized  crime, to the owners and clientele of Studio 54, to glittering society  names-especially if they were divorcing-and a host of the mighty in  business and politics. At the same time Cohn, himself the target of  numerous indictments, was haunted by professional misconduct charges and  finally disbarred shortly before his death. His private life was even more  startling than the public one. Roy Cohn's name was constantly in gossip  columns, hobnobbing with the glitterati; then there were his lovers, his  denials of his homosexuality and AIDS, and finally his death from  AIDS-related cancer in 1986. Nicholas von Hoffman has created a remarkable  and provocative biography. interviewing family members, colleagues,  clients, friends, and lovers, he gives us an extraordinary portrait of the  man, his ideological passion, and the patterns of power and money that  controlled his life. From the hidden bank accounts, numerous incidents of  political fixing, and surprising connections, to the clients who were  bilked, the judges and politicians who made his singular practice of law  possible, Citizen Cohn reveals the real Roy Cohn. Nicholas von Hoffman has  written for the Chicago Daily News, the Washington Post, and King Features  Syndicate, and reported through the electronic media on CBS's '60 Minutes,  CBS Radio, and the Byline Radio Syndicate.

This third volume of Kate Simon's extraordinary memoirs centers  around the main people in her later life. Her first husband's illness and  death were followed by two bittersweet love affairs and then by the painful  death of her daughter -her only child-whose long illness the author  describes with her usual blend of empathy and self-restraint. Her younger  sister, whom she had helped to raise, also died at this time. Kate's  relationship with her second husband grew bitter, and after an illness she  entered a hospital, had an abortion, and went into analysis. In the years  that followed Kate took up the travels for which she became famous in her  books and articles. Here, however, she describes not scenery or  architecture but people-especially men-who became friends or lovers and  offered marriage or adventure. The book ends with a portrait of the author  as she was at the end of her life-well centered, elderly, a bit tired, but  still pushing, still entertained. <br />Kate Simon (1912-90) was born in  Warsaw, Poland, and came to the United States with her family at the age of  four.

Part picaresque novel, part moving romance, part historical document, this  extraordinary reconstruction of fifteenth-century Spain, by one of Mexico's  leading literary figures, has been acclaimed throughout Europe and Latin  America. This was the century that changed the face of Spain, and of the  world-the century of the wars with the Moors, which led to the end of  Moorish Spain; the voyages of discovery, which culminated in Columbus's  enterprise; and, perhaps above all, the century of the Inquisition, which  financed both the wars and the voyages by seizing the fortunes of condemned  Jews, and which led inexorably to the Expulsion. Here these events are seen  through the eyes of one Juan Cabezon, a descendant of converted Jews, who  is orphaned at an early age by a series of bizarre accidents and taken in  hand by Pero Menique, a clever blind man, who uses him as a guide through  the rich street life of Castil. It is Menique who brings him beautiful  young Isabel de la Vega, sentenced to death by the Inquisition, and begs  him to hide her in his house Juan and Isabel fall in love, but as time  passes, Isabel is driven close to madness by her forced seclusion in Juan's  house and her constant fear of death. One day she vanishes, and Juan sets  off on a desperate search for her which takes him across Spain, into the  heart of the Jewish communities, and constantly into the path of the  Inquisition's autos-da-fea journey that stamps itself indelibly on the  reader's mind.<br />About the Author: Homero Aridjis is one of Mexico's  foremost poets and novelists.

It is that and more. It is a raft-ride through  the white water of American opinion and thought. It is Mark Twain and Ring  Lardner, Will Rogers and H.L. Mencken, Walter Lippmann and Joseph Alsop,  Russell Baker and Calvin Trillin. It is nothing less than the American  voice fortissimo-often blunt, occasionally eloquent, always opinionated,  inspiring, infuriating, delightful. In this wonderfully diverse anthology,  New York Times editorial writer Karl Meyer brings together 72 of America's  finest columnists, the first such collection ever published. The range of  voices is remarkable, stretching from Ben Franklin (who, as Silence Dogood,  castigates the evils of demon rum) to Anna Quindlen (who writes on the  travails of being pregnant in New York City). H.L. Mencken lambasts  Truman's 1948 presidential campaign as 'unhampered by anything resembling a  coherent body of ideas.&quot; Mary McGrory describes sitting in Judge  Sirica's courtroom as the Watergate tapes are played on the &quot;little  Sony&quot;: how Haldeman slumps in his chair, how Mitchell turns faintly  pink. Milt Gross renders a demented comic version of Pocohantas and Keptain  John Smeet in American Yiddish dialect (&quot;Hends opp!-odder we'll cot  you off de scallop wid a tommyhuck!&quot;). Heywood Broun offers a  tongue-in-cheek explanation of &quot;How I Became a Red.&quot; And I.F.  Stone assails our collective guilt in Kennedy's assassination (&quot;We all  favor murder, when it reaches our own hated opponents&quot;).  To read  these columns is to walk through American history and savor the views of  some of our finest commentators, declaiming on everything from freedom of  the press to yesterday's double-header.	2000-09-06

Even a whisper of impropriety can ruin the Honorable Chester Y. \\"Pops\\"  Popowski's judicial career prospects, and this note hints at a very severe  scandal indeed. But when the blackmailer turns up dead, Brady's in a real  bind. Client privilege means he can't tell the cops why he met the  blackmailer in a dingy bar off State Street or why that meeting was  violent. He can't reveal his client's name. Now as prime suspect, Brady  Coyne takes a trip down the dark side, caught between his need for justice,  freedom, and the nagging feeling that the prison doors are going to slam  with him on the inside. A superbly written thriller with a good sense of  humor.	2000-09-02

US	53072274	R2J9ZNNUT5XYIP	0595003524	157178566	A Series of Murders	Books	5	6	6	N	N	fine Brett effort	Simon Brett now returns to the extraordinary character who made him  famous: Charles Paris, the usually out-of-work actor who on occasion  imbibes a little too much and who detects even better than he acts. A  Series of Murders finds Charles gainfully employed in what he hopes will be  the long-running Stanislas Braid television series based on some rather  dated 1930s novels. Charles is booked for three highly paid months as  Sergeant Clump of the Little Breckington Police Station, foil to the suave  detective Braid, a disciple of the School of Lord Peter Wimsey. Russell  Bentley, a wooden and egotistical leading man who always plays himself,  stars as Braid, and an impossibly bad actress, Sippy Stokes, is  &quot;absolute death&quot; as Stanislas Braid's naive young daughter,  Christina. Television sitcoms hardly require Shakespearean training, but  Sippy is so awful she may ruin the show.  Fortunately for the series but  sadly for Sippy, Charles discovers the young lady crushed to death beneath  a props case when he wanders into the props room (on his way to the bar)  early in the shooting schedule. Charles knows that many people had cause to  dislike Sippy or to wish her gone, but murder would seem to be an extreme  way to terminate anybody's contract. Simon Brett is in very fine form here	2000-08-27
