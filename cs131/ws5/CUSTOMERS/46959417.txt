US	46959417	R1QGZ9QLZDRBVG	0440242002	430694437	Bleachers	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Grisham departs from legal formula for football tale	\\"Bleachers\\" departs from John Grisham's usual legal thriller formula to tell the story of a dying football coach and some of the key players who have returned to their hometown to honor him. In particular, the plot revolves around Neely Crenshaw, a high school All-American who blew out his knee in his sophomore season in college and never played football again.<br /><br />Crenshaw has old demons involving his relationship with Coach Eddie Rake, as well as a failed romance and a middling real estate career. The primary character arc for Crenshaw is coming to grips with what he learned from Coach Rake and moving on from reliving his high school glory days and getting over his poor choice of girlfriends from his teen years.<br /><br />Coach Rake never appears in the book. His life is told through the flashbacks and stories of those he influenced. He comes across as one of those megalomaniacal coaches who tortures his players, physically and psychologically abuses them yet build character for success. As the layers peel away, we learn how he supported some of his players after their football careers were over. It's a tale we've heard before, of the tyrant coach quietly helping his boys behind the scenes. Once a player, always a player. For males, the equivalents would be boot camp, fierce fraternity hazing or intense football practices meant to build unity and confidence.<br /><br />The book is a light read, good for a plane ride or vacation at the beach. While the book is well-plotted and paced, the characters lack multi-dimensions and depth. Most of the story is told in dialogue, which makes for a brisk pace, but the reader is not shown much in real time. Ex-players sit in the bleachers rehashing their glory days. Ex-players tell the sheriff about a significant event that happened during their championship day. Ex-player tells ex-girlfriend that he's sorry for dumping her for the school tart. And so on. Lots of talking heads.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a quick read about a small town high school football coach and his players, this will work for you, but if you're expecting an in-depth examination with interesting character development, this work falls short.or a quick read about a small town high school football coach and his players, this will work for you, but if you're expecting an in-depth examination with interesting character development, this work falls short.	2005-05-27

I purchased the new edition to get updates on my favorite groups and to cover all of the material that had been released since 1992. Many groups from the grunge/alternative/post-modern/1990s power pop/etc. genres are included, which is cool.<br /><br />What I like, is the inclusion of newer groups and material, and I think that in general the star ratings are accurate.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br /><br />There are glaring omissions, such as George Harrison (but with Ringo Starr!) and no Metallica. There are blatant editing errors. For example, Sting covered the Police song \\"Shadows in the Rain\\" on his solo debut, not \\"Consider Me Gone.\\"<br /><br />What I really don't like:<br /><br />Some of the reviewers come off as not liking the music they're writing about. The star ratings show one thing, but then the reviewer just rips into things like Steely Dan's choice of backing musicians. It's as if someone decided what was cool and what was not, and then vented all of their frustration about not being a musician and turning into a critic in the group reviews. I also would have liked more about the music, and not half a column about Robert Smith of the Cure's makeup habits.<br /><br />Buy this for the ratings, but beware that the music you enjoy may be shredded!	2005-04-02

First, I learned about Bono's songwriting process, or lack of, and how the themes for the songs came together. Second, the book covers every song up through All That You Can't Leave Behind, including covers, B-sides, etc. in the appendix. The chronology and discrography are useful, and the book is packed with cool pictures. Many of the song stories contain snippets of interviews with the band members and producers, so you get different viewpoints on specific songs and records in general. It was interesting to read how things evolved, and how some songs were passed through different hands for polishing.<br /><br />If that's what you expect, then it's a pretty good fan capsule. There are pieces of band history and relationships presented, but that part mostly skims the surface.<br /><br />My main knock on the book is that Niall Stokes is such an insider with the group, or a fan, that he is unable to offer more critical analysis on some of the tunes. To read here, nearly every song is a masterpiece. If you take a step back you see repetitive structures in the early works, mixed themes in even the best songs (from mud huts in Central America to a grimy city in Bullet The Blue Sky) and pieces from Zooropa and Pop that don't really stand the test of time.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, U2 is one of my favorite bands, and they have produced an outstanding catalog of songs, but one needs to be more objective in examining the body of work.	2005-03-17

The result is an interesting trip through the most ancient civilizations of \\"western\\" culture. They reached all the way back to Sumer and the myths that form the early books of Genesis, Exodus, etc. in the Bible. Characters such as Abraham, Moses, Jacob and Joseph come to life, and the development of Egyptian culture forms the basis of the freemasons ritual. The ancient secrets of king-making tie strongly to ancient Egypt, then into Canaan/Palestine/Judah/Israel with Moses.<br /><br />There is a lot of revisionist history here, as well as conspiracy theory of how the Roman Catholic church has suppressed knowledge and changed stories to fit their own end. The amazing thing is that a lot of this makes sense. The sections dealing with the life of Jesus Christ are fascinating. The ideas presented will at first seem radical to those who follow blind faith and have not questioned what has been drilled into our heads by the organized Christian (Catholic) church for years. For example, accepting that Jesus had brothers and sisters is now generally accepted, yet not widely discussed. The entire section about Qumran and Jesus' brother, James the Just, is very interesting, as well as their interpretation of various Bible passages. According to \\"Key\\" Jesus was a radical preparing an army to oust the Romans, far from the peace and love preached by the church. They also claim that it was Paul who took the life and teachings of Jesus, twisted them into mythical and heroic proportions and began the cult that evolved into Christianity.<br /><br />Jump forward about a thousand years to the Crusades, and the Knights Templar alledgedly unearth the Nasorean scrolls that depict the \\"true\\" story of the Biblical period, with alternate Gospels that show Jesus as a mortal man, rather than the divine figure portrayed by the church.<br /><br />They even describe how the Shroud of Turin could actually be the image of a Templar who was tortured by the church when the Templars were rounded up nearly eliminated by the Inquisition.<br /><br />Another idea presented here is that North America was actually discovered by Knights Templar who journeyed west from Scotland. The evidence is at Rosslyn chapel, where images of aloe cactus and maize corn, indigenous to America, are carved into the architecture of a building that was completed before Columbus ever set sail.<br /><br />While there were several leaps of logic in the theories presented, and they remain theories, because proof of lacking, I found this book a very interesting presentation of history.<br /><br />After all, the Gospels were not written at the time of Christ, and just imagine how much a story could have changed a few years after the fact, let alone decades. Follow that with careful editing and censorship, translation from Aramaic and Hebrew into Greek, then Latin, then English, etc. Who knows what really happened?

The book remains on the NY Times bestseller list nearly two years later. Richard Abanes \\"challenging response\\" strikes me first as someone's attempt to ride the coattails of someone else's success, especially when his other titles are books responding to Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is a work of fiction, with some interesting ideas about the origins of the Christian and later Catholic church, such as Jesus being married to and having children with Mary Magdelene. DVC brings out ideas about \\"the sacred feminine\\" and paganism, as well as the \\"truth\\" of the Holy Grail legend and ideas about the Knights Templar. If I'm to believe that this is true, then I'd also like to have a look in that warehouse where the U.S. government stored the Ark of the Covenant at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. There are lots of conspiracy theories out there, and DVC feeds right into people's love of a good thriller.<br /><br />I did find the book to have an anti-Christian bent in general and anti-Catholic bent in particular. To that end, Abanes book brings some of this into balance. His arguments are presented clearly and concisely, in an easy to read format that breaks down the various \\"theories\\" presented in The Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />My problem with \\"The Truth Behind The Da Vinci Code\\" is that there seems to be a belief that the Bible is infallible, and all that the Christian church has created around the legend is the irrefutable truth. One need only look at a variety of world religions to uncover \\"virgin birth\\" stories, and the fact that many Christian holidays/feast days neatly overlap original pagan feast days. Also, the gospels where not recorded during the life of Jesus, so who is to say there was no embellishment on the truth? Since we know little of his life between the ages of 12-30, is it not possible that he could have enjoyed the life of a normal mortal man until then?<br /><br />Both books raise many arguments about the nature of one of the world's great religions, and this should be questioned and argued. By getting a taste of different viewpoints, we can revise our faith.<br /><br />Further recommended reading includes: The Last Temptation of Christ and The Hiram Key.mortal man until then? <br />Both books raise many arguments about the nature of one of the world's great religions, and this should be questioned and argued.

Ben was born a slave, but his mother caught the eye of a white man, St. Denis Janvier, who purchased her along with her son and daughter. Educated in languages as well as becoming a surgeon, and classically trained as a pianist, Ben currently makes his living giving piano lessons and playing at various balls in New Orleans.<br /><br />Things change suddenly when his mother's original owner, a despicable sugar plantation magnate, Simon Fourchet, comes calling and asks Ben to pose as a slave in order to find out who is sabotaging his sugar harvest and trying to kill him.<br /><br />This is one of Hambly's most intense outing yet, and Ben is put into some considerable peril while trying to unravel the various threads to find out who caused the murders of several slaves as well as damaged some key equipment.<br /><br />Posing as the slave of his friend, the consumptive violinist Hannibal Sefton, the two travel upriver to Fourchet's plantation, Mon Triomphe. There, Ben must adapt the language of a field hand and muster all of his strength of character to restrain himself as he witnessess the cruelty of overseers and Fourchet himself. Hambly does not use the delicate issue of slavery of window dressing, but addresses it head on, and there are some visceral and graphic scenes depicted here.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ben must get in with both the field hands and the house servants as well as gaining knowledge about the white family controlling the plantation. The plot is intricately woven, and there are several surprises awaiting Ben. Luckily, his friend, Abishag Shaw, has given him a way to communicate by tying colorful bandannas to a tree and changing them daily. If he fails to change the color, help will be on the way...he hopes.<br /><br />There is voodoo, conspiracy, twisted family relationships and affairs within affairs that will keep the reader guessing as well as turning pages.<br /><br />As usual, Hambly has crafted an detailed novel with vivid descriptions of places and people. I felt like I was there with Janvier. Her research is outstanding and I learned about how sugar cane was harvested at the time. There are many interesting historical nuggets here.<br /><br />Some bumps...<br /><br />She referred to the entrance to the sugar mill as a gateway to hell, which when first encountered was awesome, but this description was repeated multiple times, which diminished the impact.<br /><br />A typical challenge of all books in the series is the sheer number of characters. We have the various slaves and families, as well as the plantation owners, neighbors and various side characters.

One has to give these guys credit for keeping the fires burning all these years, with no band turnover, and creative output that continues to be inventive, original and uncompromising. What amazes me is that critics in mainstream music magazines still like to label Rush as a sci-fi/fantasy prog-rock outfit that writes space operas and songs about gnomes and elves. That was done over twenty years ago! Since the early eighties, their songs have focused on social, political and psychological issues as well as relationships and the human condition.<br /><br />Back to the book...<br /><br />It's arranged chronologically, with each chapter covering an album/cd release and subsequent tour. The writing is mostly transcribed interviews, and I found that Alex Lifeson was quite talkative and provided the most insight. Funny considering Neil Peart is the lyricist and Geddy Lee is the vocalist. Lifeson also displayed great humor.<br /><br />While the style proved to be breezy and chatty, as if the reader is sitting on a couch across from the guys, I wanted more meat on the bones. While the press release reads that every song is analyzed, this amounts to little more than a sentence or two on most tunes. I wanted more specifics than hearing that \\"Grace Under Pressure\\" was difficult to record. Why? What made it hard? There were other examples of this, but I did find that more time was spent with recent material, say the last five or so studio releases and the two recent live sets. This was good, since I'm less familiar with the newer material, being an old school Rush fan from back in the day.<br /><br />What comes across is that the members of Rush are gracious, intelligent men committed to their craft, while also pursuing outside hobbies to enrich their lives. They avoid negative talk about other groups or music industry folks, save a veiled remarks. They are also intensely private about their families. I learned that Alex has a grown son, also a musician, and that Alex is now a grandfather. Very little is mentioned about Geddy Lee's family. Most Rush fans should by now be familiar with the tragedies of Neil Peart's family. Read \\"Ghost Rider\\" to learn more about that.<br /><br />If you're looking from the road like the Led Zeppelin book \\"Hammer of the Gods\\" or Bill Wyman's \\"Stone Alone\\" this is not for you. This is a career overview that focuses on the music, with lots of band pictures that show the evolution of their fashion over the years.as a grown son, also a musician, and that Alex is now a grandfather.

Nelson Demille's \\"By the Rivers of Babylon\\" is a military thriller from the late 1970's. The basic premise involves an Israeli peace delegation flying to New York on two Concordes, only to be hijacked by Palestinian terrorists. When they crash land on the ancient site of Babylon, the small group of men and women, with only a handful of weapons, but a strategic defensive advantage, makes a stand against a superior force.<br /><br />Aside from some of the obvious dating due to historical changes during the past twenty-five years, this book works surprisingly well. Of course, a plane load of Israelis crashing in Iraq during the past few years would have met a different fate.<br /><br />Several things make this story work: The first is the pacing and orchestration of the action scenes. Demille proves adept and building action, juggling multiple sequences and moving us forward on this roller coaster ride. For example, when they first crash, they have only a small contingent of security men, but one happens to have an M-14 with a starlight scope, and he is able to become an effective sniper to hold off the initial advance. But the stakes are always high, and with each attack the defenders are pushed closer to the brink.<br /><br />Another thing that works is that the characters are strong enough to hold our interest. Most are not fully developed, but the two key players, Jacob Hausner and Miriam Bernstein, are dynamic and create an emotional core. Hausner is the head of El Al airline security who must deal with his own sense of failure, internal power struggles, and desire to eradicate his nemesis, Ahmed Rish. Rish, the leader of the terrorists, is the brilliant but insane leader of the Palestinians.<br /><br />Miriam Bernstein is one of the leaders of the Peace Delegation, who undergoes significant changes in her relationships and viewpoints on the peace process.<br /><br />Along the way, there are various heroes who rise to the occasion, such as the pilot, David Becker, the intelligence man, Isaac Burg, the American operative, McClure, General Dobkin, F-14 pilot Teddy Laskov and a host of others.<br /><br />It's definitely a pot boiler that you won't want to put down.the intelligence man, Isaac Burg, the American operative, McClure, General Dobkin, F-14 pilot Teddy Laskov and a host of others.<br /><br />It's definitely a pot boiler that you won't want to put down.	2004-10-19

He also happens to have the family curse of seeing visions of the future.<br /><br />The story of full of plots within plots, characters who are more than they appear to be, and plenty of action. There is subterfuge, counter-plotting, revenge and romance.<br /><br />In addition to Genji, the other primary characters are Heiko, the most lovely geisha in all Japan, Emily, a beautiful young American perceived as ugly in Japan, and Matthew Stark, a gunfighter seeking revenge on a man who has fled to Japan and become a Buddhist monk. Important sub-characters include Genji's uncle Shigeru, who has horrific visions of a WWII era and overpopulated future Japan. There are also a trio of Genji's captains, Saiki, Kudo and Sohaku, who may or may not be plotting against their lord. Throw in the treacherous Kawakami, the Shogun's chief of secret police, as well as Kuma the Bear, the deadliest ninja in Japan, and Genji has plenty of antagonists.<br /><br />The story was intriguing, and the plot moved along quickly, with rarely a dull moment. It's a page-turning read. I enjoyed the comparison/contrast of Japan and outside cultures, and Matsuoka went to considerable detail on clothing. Genji is a likable protaganist, who faces a number of challenges, and exhibits some character arc by the end of the story. He makes some unexpected decisions. Emily also grows in the story, and has to make some difficult choices as well.<br /><br />Matsuoka attempted an third person omniscient point-of-view strategy, getting us into the heads of just about every character in the book. This was sometimes successful in presenting an almost \\"Rashomon\\" type review of scenes from different perspectives, but was sometimes confusing as we backtracked to scenes that have already ended. There are also a lot of character histories told in flashback. This is the essential problem with the book. There was more \\"telling\\" than \\"showing\\" with character emotions and stories, and not enough vivid detail to fully bring me into the character's world.<br /><br />Also, I felt that the buildup for the relationships was better than the payoff. I was disappointed in the Stark vs. Jimbo showdown.<br /><br />Finally, the novel is very graphically violent. Especially involving children. So if you are sensitive to that type of thing, beware.ient point-of-view strategy, getting us into the heads of just about every character in the book.

The title is a bit misleading, because the book is not strictly about Ichiro, but also deals with success stories such as Hideo Nomo, Hideki Matsui, Kazuo Matsui and the challenges to a player like Hideki Irabu.<br /><br />Whiting includes a lot of interesting history, some of it rehashed from earlier volumes, but necessary here if one is to read this as a stand alone piece. He details the birth of baseball in Japan, how it became Japanized with the intense training, and some early experiences in cross-cultural play with teams from the United States. There is also some philosophy, for it is important to understand the Japanese culture and mindset, as well as the almost martial training that players endure in Japan. All very fascinating stuff.<br /><br />The bulk of the book focuses on those players since 1995 who have made their way across the Pacific to play for teams in North America. The stories about Ichiro, Nomo and Hideki Matsui are near-mythical, and one has to wonder how much truth was embellished by their families and coaches. But aren't the stories of players of this caliber always near-mythical?<br /><br />While the prose reads well, and Whiting is very knowledgeable about the Japanese game, I found numerous factual errors. Ichiro was born in 1973, but the book had him entering junior high school in 1975! Now that's precocious. Probably a typo, but in a baseball book, errors with dates and stats are killers. Another error had the Yankees winning the 1995 World Series, when they were ousted in the Division Series by the Seattle Mariners. Yeah, it's nit-picky, but it does make one wonder about the other stats and whether the fact-checkers and editors did their jobs well or not.<br /><br />The other knock that I have is that Whiting made some references about Seattle that sounded like he has never even been to the city, or that his information is terribly dated. Watch those adjectives. He referred to \\"rain-soaked Safeco Field\\" possibly without knowing that it has a retractable roof, and that during the summer, Seattle is one of the drier places to be in the U.S. and way more so than in rainy, muggy Japan. Check out Art Thiel's \\"Out of Left Field\\" for the story of baseball in Seattle.<br /><br />Still, it's a great read and provides many insights in how the Japanese players perceive the North American game. The biggest thing to take away is that players in MLB should bone up on their fundamentals, kind of like the NBA players need to brush up against their international competition. The world is catching up...t. <br />The other knock that I have is that Whiting made some references about Seattle that sounded like he has never even been to the city, or that his information is terribly dated.

US	46959417	R37E3SRFCC5AT9	0060934417	546555129	Bel Canto	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Lyrical prose of opera and hostage situation	I didn't want to read too many reviews to taint my gut impressions of this book, so that's what you'll get.<br /><br />In an unnamed South American country, during a lavish party for a visiting Japanese businessman who had been convinced to attend because they hired his favorite opera singer to perform, a group of terrorists burst in looking for the president of the country, only to learn that he has begged off attendance at the party in order to watch his favorite soap opera. The resulting hostage situation quickly develops into a Stockholm Syndrome story where the prisoners begin to empathize with their captors, and the terrorists are not as nasty as one would expect.<br /><br />Bel Canto is not an action story, but rather a character driven tale that unfolds and meanders in and out of different character's points of view. This is both a strength and weakness of the story. We see many things through many sets of eyes, learn their stories and feel their emotions. The problem is there are so many stories and sub-stories, that some strands are left as loose ends.<br /><br />Among the more important characters are, of course, Mr. Hosokawa, the businessman whose birthday brought all of these people together. He is a calm, steady character who realizes the joy that was missing in his life. Roxanne Coss is the soprano from America who sang at the party, and the only female hostage to remain after most of the guests and staff are released. She is a bargaining chip, but she alters the course of events when she begins to sing and the beauty of her voice affects all around her.<br /><br />A lesser character, but important, is Mr. Kato, a senior VP in Hosokawa's company, but also an excellent pianist.

This book was really an enjoyable read. Even though I've never watched the show, I was able to get leadership examples from Tony Soprano's point of view in a humorous format. You might ask yourself, \\"a self-help book based on Tony Soprano?\\" But Deborrah Himsel pulls this off effectively. She's quick to point out that Tony is not an ideal role model, but that he is an effective leader. She adeptly translates his style into more typical layman's terms, and a lot of it makes sense. For example, if your vendor is not doing what he should for your business, you can't go out and whack the VP, but you can use some conflict resolution skills, such as a sit-down, to work things out.<br /><br />So, this book uses examples from the Sopranos show to create business scenarios that might translate to one's own working life. The samples also provide a contrast of what not to do. This creates a multi-viewed approach that makes sense, and is less dry or rah-rah than typical business leadership books.<br /><br />Take a look at the case studies and see if Tony can help you become a more effective boss.	2004-08-31

The astronomy and geometry are written for a layman's level, without being too dry or technical, but not childish either. Heath details how the earth moves about the sun, with seasons and the calendar, as well as two types of lunar cycles, equinoxes, solstices, eclipses, etc. The book details how our calendar works and offers some interesting alternatives. There's even a short chapter about Stonehenge, which can be further explored in another volume by the same publisher.<br /><br />I found it fascinating how much megalithic astronomers knew about the sun and moon cycles, especially the geometry, but then again, they didn't have much else to do and light pollution was almost non-existent then. Imagine what the sky looked like in 3000 BC! The book is full of cool illustrations and tables and overall is well put together.	2004-08-02

While it is derivative of most epic high fantasy series, such as Lord of the Rings, there is also a liberal dose of Narnia-type spirituality and a fish out of water in the title character.<br /><br /> Thomas Covenant is a novelist in a modern but rural U.S. town who suddenly loses everyting when he mysteriously contracts leprosy and becomes an outcast in his own community. A freak accident thrusts him into an alternate universe. He immediately encounters two evil forces, the title character Lord Foul and a malignant cavewight named Drool Rockworm. What follows is Covenant's quest to aid the inhabitants of the land in reclaiming an artifact from Drool and attempting to stop Lord Foul from destroying their world.<br /><br /> Covenant has an interesting series of adventures on his way to the city of Revelstone. He meets Lena, a young woman who aids him but whose trust he betrays, and her mother Atiaran, who leads him to a mighty river. Once there he mights the excellently named giant, Saltheart Foamfollower. And the adventure continues...<br /><br /> The book is full of vivid description of The Land, where the inhabitants have a spiritual affinity with the earth, kind of granola hippy elves and wizards. Very 1970s, but not dated at all. There is amazing depth and passion in these characters, and this is a character driven fantasy.<br /><br /> Of course, the most important character is Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, so called because he does not accept that The Land is healing his leprosy and that he bears a startling resemblance to a prophetic figure of the land, due to his missing several fingers on his right hand. He also has a ring of white gold, which is magical in the land, but whose power he does not understand nor have any ability to control. Covenant is a character in conflict, an anti-hero surrounded by heroes. This makes the story challenging, because at times I wanted to smack him because he was so testy, whiny, selfish and weak. In the end, these flaws create a well-rounded character, and one can only hope that he develops more heroism and skill in the subsequent volumes.<br /><br /> The quest also has a satisfying conclusion, yet enough of a dangle at the end to lead one to explore the next book, &quot;The Illearth War.&quot;because he was so testy, whiny, selfish and weak. In the end, these flaws create a well-rounded character, and one can only hope that he develops more heroism and skill in the subsequent volumes. <br /> The quest also has a satisfying conclusion, yet enough of a dangle at the end to lead one to explore the next book, &quot;The Illearth War.&quot;	2004-07-26

Cannell is best know for his various television series, but he also pens fast-paced action novels that are similar in spirit. King Con involves a fallen card sharp, Beano Bates, after he rips off a mafia boss named Joe &quot;Dancer&quot; Rina. The boss catches him and beats him nearly to death. A witness comes forward and is under the protection of a tough lawyer named Victoria Hart. Tragic events bring Bates and Hart together to bring down Joe Rina and his brother Tommy, in the biggest of all cons.<br />I like the progression of scams, from a card game, jewel switch, craps cheating and finally a bogus oil company. With each scenario, the stakes were upped and things were never easy, but rather a house of cards ready to collapse at any moment. The book features an interesting cast of characters, many in the Bates con artist extended family. The dialogue was ready for film, the sets were easy to imagine and there was tension on every page.<br />The characters were pretty forgettable, with not a whole lot of dimension. Most of the time they're thinking about how they should be living instead of doing it. The old show vs. tell criticism. There were also points where things got over the top, like the whole Arkansas Bates clan and the hillbilly stereotype, although the invoice was funny.<br />Obviously Cannell is having fun, and it's interesting to learn the con person's lingo. Don't take this book too seriously. It's a popcorn book to enjoy on a long flight or vacation at the beach house or ski lodge.	2004-03-22

I have to admit that it was not until I saw him on Oprah that I actually went out and got the book. The reason was seeing him interviewed by himself, then with his wife, Trudie Styler. He showed different sides in the interview, and that's what comes through in his memoir, \\"Broken Music.\\"<br />Much of Sting's life story has been available for years in various interviews and articles about his career, but what we get here is the personal viewpoint and emotion of a man driven to succeed at his craft. Also, we get deep inside his head with his relationship with his parents. As one reads what he went through with his family, it becomes apparent where he got a lot of the inspiration for his songs.<br />It's also interesting to see how his early music career as a jazz musician shaped the evolution of the music by The Police and his later solo career, when he recruited top young American jazz musicians to form another top group.<br />Back to the book. Stings describes his childhood in Wallsend near the Scottish border, and growing up as \\"the milkman's son.\\" He shares a number of amusing anecdotes, and demonstrates a flair for literate prose and self-deprecating sense of humor. This is a man who rose above his upbringing, but is not afraid to tell a bawdy joke or two. One of my favorite stories was about him trying to impress a girlfriend, getting his car stuck, and having to call his dad to bail him out.<br />Sting covers his childhood, grammar school and college years, a series of dead end jobs, and fledgling music career in detail. He identifies a number of influences, mentors and friends who helped him move forward to achieve his dream of becoming a successful musician. He also describes various romances that were important in his life, and how his early family life influenced the success or demise of these romances.<br />Sting gives credit where credit is due, but also provides honest portrayals of his associates.<br />While Sting has a strong sense of atmosphere and narrative, I did find the frequent shifts of tense sometimes jarring. Parts of the story are also non-linear, but the future projections are often helpful in explaining how a particular person would be important later on in his life.<br />Various folks and critics have called him arrogant and pretentious over the years, and while Mr. Sumner is extremely self-aware, what comes across more is an individual determined to succeed. The Police were a great success, but if there was animosity amongst his peers related to song-writing, it's because Sting was the better songwriter. He is also one who has tried to contribute himself to causes other than himself, and I can see where this can bring about a backlash.<br />This is a fascinating tale and a worthy read. Then, get out the disks and enjoy his music with a new perspective.provides honest portrayals of his associates.<br />While Sting has a strong sense of atmosphere and narrative, I did find the frequent shifts of tense sometimes jarring.

He also seems to be fond of his own writing and clever turning of a phrase at the expense of his subject. It makes me wonder if he ever played sports, or even likes watching the games.<br />Had I not read several excerpts of the book that appeared in the P-I last year, I probably would not have wanted to read it. Those excerpts demonstrated that Thiel had more substance than his columns. In &quot;Out of Left Field&quot; he doesn't try too hard to impress us with his wit, and the book is all the better for it. We are able to enjoy the tale without author intrusion.<br />This book will primarily appear to those in the Seattle Mariners' Pacific Northwest region fan base. As a long-suffering fan who attended the M's first game in 1977, I was very familiar with the cast of characters. Thiel dug further, providing information about how the Seattle Pilots left town after only one season in 1969. He also detailed the role that Slade Gorton, a local attorney and later U.S. senator, played in not only getting an expansion team in the city in 1977, but also in building a new ownership team in 1992, and then helping to push through the program to build Safeco Field.<br />While much of what has transpired with the Mariners over the years is fairly well-known, we also get more background of how Hiroshi Yamauchi came to purchase the team, along with executives from Nintendo, Microsoft, McCaw Cellular, and a host of local politicians. The story is as much about Minoru Arakawa, John Ellis, Howard Lincoln, etc. as it is about Lou Piniella, Ken Griffey, Jr., Alex Rodriguez and Randy Johnson. The part about how the M's almost passed on Griffey as the number one pick is interesting. The behind the scenes look at the player personalities and egos at work also sets up how and why various players departed.<br />We get Seattle's wild ride in 1995 over the Yankees in the ALDS, and how they survived the departure of their marquee players and then Piniella after 2002. Jay Buhner, the M's long-time right fielder, provides a number of colorful quotes.<br />For any baseball fan, it's a good read that doesn't inundate the reader with too many statistics. It's about people, luck and fate. Thiel covers the who, what, where, when, how and why with little nonsense and a balanced style.sed on Griffey as the number one pick is interesting.

The Starlite Drive-In is being torn down by developers when a body and some objects are found. Callie Anne stops by to identify the remains, and is drawn back to the summer of her youth when she changed from a girl to a teenager on her way to becoming a young woman.<br />Her father is employed to manage the drive-in and spends each night above the concessions stand changing the reels. Her family lives near the grounds in a small house, and her mother, Teal, has not set foot outside for five years. Due to a leg injury, Callie Anne's father is limited in the physical activity he can perform. Into their lives comes a handsome drifter named Charlie Memphis, hired by the theater owner to perform maintenance at the site. Memphis charms mother and daughter, and also proves useful in thwarting a would-be robbery at the theater.<br />As the summer progresses, Callie Anne realizes that Memphis is less interested in her than her mother, which she at first finds distressing, then confusing as relations with her father deteriorate. Claude Dicksen treats his wife like dirt, while Charlie Memphis treats her like a man ought to treat a woman, and in the long summer evenings while Claude works the reels, an affair develops while Callie Anne eavesdrops from the sidelines.<br />There are also several subplots; one involving a war veteran named Billy who comes around mooching for food and asking Ms. Dicksen to dance. The other involves Callie Anne's blossoming romance with a boy closer to her own age, Virgil, who runs the ticket booth for Callie Anne's father.<br />While the book moves in a leisurely summer way, each scene features tension and interesting developments, and the pace and atmosphere really drew me in to the story so that I felt I was there looking over Callie Anne's shoulder. The characters were well-drawn and three-dimensional. There were times you want to be angry with Callie Anne, but you can't help but feel for her with all of the changes going on around her. Her father, Claude, as the antagonist of the piece, has issues but the reader is able to find some sympathy despite his being fairly unlikeable. Charlie Memphis is a dark hero with a mysterious past, and the full truth of some of his history is never clearly divulged. Teal Dicksen, Callie Anne's mother, undergoes the most dynamic transformation, and it's a joy to witness her release from her confinement.<br />\\"The Starlite Drive-In\\" is a moving drama that I could imagine being made into a Hallmark Hall of Fame type film.re really drew me in to the story so that I felt I was there looking over Callie Anne's shoulder.

It's a well-paced page-turner that will have you waiting for the next twist.<br />The basic premise is that unlucky, possibly cursed, Stanley Yelnats, is sentenced to  juvenile correction at Camp Green Lake after a pair of shoes falls out of the sky and hits him on the head. Camp Green Lake turns out to be a huge desert, and at the work camp, he and the other kids are forced to dig a hole each day, five feet deep and five feet in diameter. Oh, and since they're in Texas, there are tarantulas, scorpions and the dreaded spotted yellow lizards.<br />The modern story with the young teens alternates with that of Stanley's Latvian ancestor, Elya, who was cursed by Madama Zeroni for failing to fulfill a promise. There's also the tale of the bandit, \\"Kissin\\" Kate Barlow, who was originally a schoolteacher that fell in love with Sam, the onion farmer who happened to be of a different race than her.<br />Of course, we want to know why the kids have to dig these holes and how all of the various elements will be tied together and why the Warden is so obsessed with this place. I won't give away any spoilers here.<br />The story, while humorous, also features some dark sides, such as the prejudice of the original inhabitants of Green Lake. There are also moments of tension and cruelty between the various \\"campers\\" that would probably be typical of teens in this situation.<br />The villains are larger than life, the dastardly Mr. Sir and the flame-haired Warden, which suits a book for this age group. Sachar succeeds in blending the teenage incarceration story with the various tall tale elements in a fascinating story of coincidence, magical destiny and redemption.<br />Both Stanley and fellow camper Zero undergo growth, so there is character development as well.<br />There's also a feature length film, which follows the story fairly closely.<br />I recommend this book, as well as the film, and would read it again.

Harry Dresden's latest adventure builds upon the previous for books in Jim Butcher's series about Chicago's only practicing wizard.<br />In Death Masks, Harry must duel the vampire Ortega, find the missing Shroud of Turin, battle against foes both supernatural and mortal, and deal with the return of his girlfriend Susan. The fact that she's now a half-vampire and part of a secret Brotherhood makes things complicated. Butcher introduces some new nasties in the Denarians, associates of the Fallen, who gain power and corruption by possessing the thirty coins of Judas. The main thrust of the story is the search for the stolen Shroud of Turin, and trying to figure out the purpose of its theft. Butcher also throws in Gentleman John Marcone, Chicago's crime boss for good measure. Luckily Harry has help from the Holy Knights and his friend, Michael Carpenter, plus Susan with her newly suped up powers.<br />The story is well-paced, the action well-orchestrated, and the threads of the plot are laced together deftly. Butcher obviously takes time to piece together his stories, drawing on twists of religious history and the occult, and building on events from the previous books. Harry's world is increasingly complex, and he continues to grow as a character. I like the storyline remains interesting, and the author is having fun creating this universe.<br />I still find it tough to swallow when Harry always seems to be at the center of all things, as if the entire supernatural world revolves around him. Why do all of these creatures seek him out? Where the heck are all of the other wizards all of the time? There was an interesting moment toward the end with Marcone as less than adversary, but Harry seems to try to irritate people.<br />Finally, I didn't get a feeling of resolution with very many of the plot points. This was just a bridge to the next story in the series. But hey, I'm still hooked.	2004-01-27

One night his village is massacred by the chief warlord, Iida. Tomasu pulls a trick and escapes into the mountains and is saved by another warrior lord, Otori Shigeru. Otori takes Tomasu in as his son, renames him Takeo, and the young man begins to learn the way of the warrior. It soon becomes apparent that he possesses the skills of the assassin class known as \\"The Tribe\\" which include superior hearing, stealth, invisibility and the ability to leave  a \\"second self\\" behind. Later, he learns to put people to sleep.<br />Meanwhile, a second plot told in the third person involves Kaede, a young woman who is the daughter of a lord but held hostage to keep her family from considering an uprising. The warlords are to use Kaede as a pawn in an arranged marriage with Otori. Things get complicated because of a certain Lady Maruyama, and then Takeo's feelings toward Kaede. A little Shakespearean tragedy within a Japanese setting makes for plenty of intrigue.<br />Takeo makes an interesting and likable protagonist, and I found myself cheering for him and all the challenges he had to face. The side characters were also colorful, with heroic Otori Shigeru, the mysterious teacher Kenji, the doomed Lady Maruyama, jinxed Kaede, and more. You know some of them will play larger roles in the following two books.<br />I wondered about this book being a young adult novel, because while the language and sentence construction read fairly simply, there is graphic violence and some sex that should be for a more mature audience. The dialogue was sometimes stilted and overly formal, but that's the way it is in Japan, and for the most part Hearn makes this work. I also liked the author's choice of pseudonym, presumably after the great Japan historian Lafcadio Hearn.<br />  I came away wanting to know more about The Hidden and The Tribe, and hope the subsequent books reveal more, because I'm eager to continue this series. I thought the first book came to a satisfying resolution, while setting us up for things to come. Across the Nightingale Floor is an enjoyable read and definitely for those interested in Japan.orian Lafcadio Hearn.<BR>   I came away wanting to know more about The Hidden and The Tribe, and hope the subsequent books reveal more, because I'm eager to continue this series.

Around this plot swirl a typical rogues gallery of characters that enter Robicheaux's sphere: Tee Bobby Hulin, a blues guitarist and singer who pens the song that becomes the book's title. Jimmy Dean Styles, an ex-boxer and current bar owner and music producer, Marvin Oates, a seemingly innocent bible salesman, Sal Angelo, a Viet Nam vet who may have been with Dave's unit, and one of the nastiest characters Burke has brought to life, the former plantation overseer known simply as &quot;Legion.&quot; There is also a duo of lawyers, Perry LaSalle, whose grandfather owned a pepper plantation, and Barbara Shanahan, a beautiful but angry woman who gets involved with Dave's pal Clete Purcel. Throw in some drug dealers, crooked cops, New Orleans mafia and a woman with secrets and you have a dark tale that will have you turning page after page.<br />Burke's strengths continue in this book: Beautiful prose depicting the Louisiana landscape or gritty descriptions of those who inhabit this otherworldly place. The dialogue smacks you in the face. The characters show multiple dimensions and always have a surprise in store for Dave or the reader. The story works on multiple levels, with the murder mystery nearly secondary to the inner story as Dave uncovers the connection between Legion, LaSalle and Tee Bobby Hulin, and other connections.<br />My knocks would be that old Streak is getting very close to the edge of not being likable. He's a very flawed character, self-righteous to a fault, fighting off the constant urge to drink, but what bothers me is that he can't seem to have a conversation with a single person without insulting them, no matter how polite they are to him. What is it with this guy? Still, I root for him and there are some things that happen in this story that no one should have to endure.<br />Bring on Last Car to Elysian Fields!.

Wyman engages readers with vivid images and a keen memory that bring this period to life, and he also builds brief pieces for the other founding members of the Stones, Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Charlie Watts.<br />Having always been a casual fan of TRS, I learned a lot from this book. The major parts are fairly common knowledge in rock music lore, but here are some of the main points:<br />*Brian Jones was the key influence in the early days, having a genius level aptitude for learning instruments, and possessing a charisma on par with Mick Jagger's. He was also a very screwed up guy with a number of physical ailments and emotional instability.<br />*Ian Stewart was a key contributor, as a pianist, then road manager after his &quot;relegation&quot; by Andrew Oldham.<br />*While Andrew Oldham profoundly influenced their growth, he also screwed them over, as did manager Allen Klein. What happened to all of that money?<br />*Wyman was a shameless philanderer who detailed his many road conquests, but was also a doting father to his son, Stephen.<br />Wyman also had a lot of bitterness toward Jagger and Richards, for their egos, their controlling of the band and ignoring contributions of other band members and reaping a greater share of songwriting royalties. Wyman details how his own projects were shunted to the side. The Jagger/Richards/Oldham &quot;unholy trinity&quot; also led to Brian Jones becoming a sideman, never blossoming as a songwriter, and eventual ouster from the band. Well, actually, Jones own self-destructive behavior contributed greatly to these three things.<br />Wyman provides amazing details about each show, from the number of attendees, the gross receipts and what happened. It was also interesting to note his bank balance at various junctures, as the public believed these guys were millionaires when they were basically broke because of the mismanagement of their accounts by Klein.<br />Some critiques: The book is pretty long, and the anecdotes of concert, riots and screaming girls in the early years get pretty repetitive.<br />I would have liked to have learned more about the music itself and how the songs came together. This book is many about the performances and personal escapades of the band members.<br />Still, the information presented provides a great glimpse into the Stones early lives and music from 1963-69. Having read this book, I'm eager to find the next &quot;chapter&quot; and delve further into The Stones music catalog from the blues/R&amp;B period as well as songs beyond the obvious hits.g a sideman, never blossoming as a songwriter, and eventual ouster from the band.

Tolkien took Arthurian legends and Norse mythology and recreated the realm of high fantasy in the 1950s that continues to be popular today.<br />That Tolkien was able to forge a bond with &quot;Fellowship&quot; then split up the characters was a masterful stroke. In &quot;Return&quot; we follow Pippin and Gandalf to Minas Tirith, where Pippin becomes part of the tower guard for Denethor, the Steward of Gondor and father of Boromir and Faramir. Merry, left behind in Rohan, bonds with King Theoden, and later secretly rides to battle with the mysterious Dernhelm. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli take with paths of the dead to recruit an army that must fulfill its destiny to become free of a curse. We also get the sub-stories of Eowyn and Faramir. And Frodo and Sam don't even appear until the second half of the book!<br />What I liked about &quot;Return&quot; is that Tolkien continued to raise the stakes and throw obstacles in the way of his characters. Merry and Eowyn pay a price during their encounter with the ringwraithes. Frodo gets stabbed, stung and bitten. Yet, each character gets to be a hero in a believable way. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are already larger than life heroes, so the hobbits are really the source of humanity in the story, the observers who rise above their stature and perform great acts of bravery. That Tolkien could show growth in so many characters, and even in Aragorn as he gradually accepts his destiny as the king of his people, was remarkable.<br />The book is filled with excellent detail about the lands and history of the peoples, and I found myself glad that there were handy maps in the back for reference.<br />After the climax, there are another fifty or so pages as the characters make their way homeward and Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin must retake the Shire from the thugs who have assumed control. This would be unheard of in a book today, since the main action has been completed, but Tolkien is going completing the journey by having the characters return as champions. In the &quot;Scouring of the Shire&quot; chapter, we see how much the hobbits have truly grown, as they must wage a campaign without their other friends to help them. Finally, &quot;The Grey Havens&quot; draws our story to a close.<br />The appendices are also worthy of perusal, as they are filled with historical details of the world of legend, when Isildur battled Sauron, etc. as well as what happended to the principle characters after Frodo returned to the Shire. By reading these pieces, one glimpses the amazing scope that a writer can undertake to create a world filled with fascinating stories, rich history, multi-dimensional characters, and sweeping landscapes.<br />This series is highly recommended.thugs who have assumed control.

Books	3	8	12	N	N	In your face political and social diatribes	When I started reading Michael Moore's \\"Stupid White Men\\" I wasn't sure if I would finish it. The introduction is a lot of ranting about the sham of the 2000 election the Bush \\"stole\\" from Gore, and filled with enough conspiracy theory to make Oliver Stone proud. I'm not thrilled by writers that jump on a soap box and jab their finger in my chest, and have to wonder about those that insist on gimmicks like SHOUTING WITH CAPITAL LETTERS and ending every other sentence with exclamation points!!!<br />Yet, as I continued chapter after chapter, I was drawn in by Moore's compelling style and sense of humor. You simply have to read the entire book to realize that this is not simply liberal ranting, but that Moore is taking on both Republicans and Democrats. Bush and his cabinet are targets for sure, but Moore points out that the person who really let the election slip away was Gore. Clinton is not spared, and the list of measures that his adminstration signed is eye-opening, from the administration that supposedly did so much for the economy and environment.<br />Moore takes on a number of topics, from big business (average starting pay for a pilot at American Eagle was $16,800 in 2001), white people (every person who has ever harmed me in my lifetime..has been a white person), and the education system (how do we make politics as engaging as sports?).<br />As you read, you should not be shocked by what is stated, because deep inside we know most of this stuff is true, and we're not doing anything about it.<br />While the book is filled with jokey things, like how a man can \\"survive your bed being set on fire\\" there is useful advice for slobs. Moore has also packed the book with addresses and web sites for how to contact your senator or congressperson, literacy programs, and lists like fifty world leaders and much more.<br />Whether or not you agree with Michael Moore's viewpoint doesn't matter, you should take a look at this book. Whether you do something about any of the issues is up to you.up to you.	2003-11-05

It's not \\"Harry Potter\\" or \\"The Thief Lord\\" which are geared toward a youth market.<br />The story is set on fictitious Clam Island in Washington state's San Juan islands, where there is a place on the western side of the island that never sees rain during the summer. This is Summerland, and it is where the local little league teams play their games.<br />An eleven year old boy on one of the teams, Ethan Feld, is not much of a ballplayer, but he's friends with Jennifer T. Rideout, one of the best players on the team. There's also Thor Wignutt, a player who thinks he's an android and talks like Data from Star Trek. One day Ethan begins having strange visions of bushbabies near the field and on the roadside. The creature is actually a werefox named Cutbelly, and meeting him is the beginning of Ethan's adventure.<br />Ethan's father is an inventer and tinkerer who has come up with a material used in a portable blimp that they fly around the island. It turns out that a certain character wants to use the material to hold a substance so that he can bring about the end of the world. Once Mr. Feld is kidnapped, it's up to Ethan, his friends, and an odd assortment of characters that they meet along the way, to save the day.<br />It's kind of like \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" meets \\"The Bad News Bears\\" with a liberal dose of random mythologies thrown in for spice.<br />For example, we have the \\"ferishers\\" who are dimunitive creatures (faeries?) that excell at baseball and scampering between the various world/dimensions known as the summerlands, the winterlands, and the middling (our world) with the gleaming as the great world shut off from the rest. The ferishers call humans \\"reubens\\" or \\"rubes.\\" It's a takeoff on a greenhorn ballplayer.<br />The end of the world is called \\"Ragged Rock\\" which comes from the Norse mythology \\"Ragnarok.\\"<br />And, the antagonist is Coyote, popular in Native American lore and akin to Loki, a trickster and master of change. Coyote also invented baseball, and Chabon uses baseball both literally and metaphorically to move the story forward.<br />I liked the blending of the various mythologies, especially the sequence involving Ethan's team playing against a team made up of the \\"liars\\" which are characters from tall tales like John Henry, Paul Bunyan, etc.<br />Ethan must save his father, and the world as well, while developing his new position of catcher and dealing with an unfinished magical \\"bat\\" made from an ash wood branch taken from the great tree of the universe. There's another link in that baseball bats are made from ash and this type of wood allegedly holds magical properties.<br />Jennifer must develop into a pitcher, and deal with some of her family issues.<br />I enjoyed the story, but I'm not sure if kids in the 12-15 age group will grasp all of the literary subtleties, but then again maybe so. I enjoyed Chabon's use of the language and thought the story was well-told, although the characters did not always come off as wholy sympathetic. If you like baseball and fantasy, and are looking for an escape, this is a pleasant read.nist is Coyote, popular in Native American lore and akin to Loki, a trickster and master of change.

The basic concept is there, androids that are close to human escape from Mars and come back to earth to blend in with society, and a bounty hunter must track them down and \\"retire\\" them.<br />The book is set in a much more bleak nuclear aftermath, were radioactive dust permeates the atmosphere, blotting out the sun, and causing defects in many humans that make them \\"specials\\" or the more derogatory terms \\"chickenheads\\" or \\"antheads.\\" The dust has also killed off most mammals, birds and insects. Owning an animal is very important to those left on earth, and everyone carries a guidebook to check the values when they want to encounter an animal.<br />Rick Deckard is the number two bounty hunter with the San Francisco police force. He owns an electric sheep and badly wants to have a real animal, be it a horse, a goat, a toad, or whatever. When he is assigned to track down six escaped Nexus 6 androids, all he think of spending his earnings on is an animal.<br />The story follows Deckard through his day and gives us many glimpses into what life is like for these people. We learn about their religion, with \\"Mercerism\\" vs. the omnipresent television and radio personality \\"Buster Friendly.\\" We see their hovercars, and we also see life through the viewpoint of a special named John Isidore, who attempts to help three of the escaped androids.<br />What I really enjoy about Philip K. Dick's writing is that he created science fiction that was more speculative fiction, with bits of futuristic tech and lingo sprinkled like spice, so that it appears to be a world much like our own, but with different tweaks here and there. Also, he explores the deeper stuff like what makes us human. Is it empathy? Is it the group catharsis of climbing the hill, enduring the stones, sinking into the earth and being reborn? Is it caring for an animal? The nature of humanity vs. android is a powerful theme that gets twisted and turned as Deckard encounters a variety of archetypes in his quest to retire the androids and collect his bounty. The mysterious counter bounty hunter Phil Resch appears for a few scenes, helps Deckard, then disappears. It remains open whether he was really human or android. There's also Rachael Rosen, a Nexus 6 android who seduces Deckard, then performs an unthinkable act that nearly breaks him.<br />One of the key things that makes a book great is whether you think about its concepts when your not reading it, and keep thinking after you're done. \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" aka \\"Blade Runner\\" succeeds in this department.f humanity vs. android is a powerful theme that gets twisted and turned as Deckard encounters a variety of archetypes in his quest to retire the androids and collect his bounty.

Wolfe, the first and only werewolf on the Boston police force. His latest partner, Detective Ryan, (we're never told his full name), is the straight man tasked to find information that will have Frank thrown off the force, but Ryan hopes to prove Frank's innocence.<br /> Meanwhile, the pair investigates the murder of a librarian, encounter the dark, savage \\"trashcan people\\" and square off against local crime figures and their loaner minions from the \\"mafia exchange program.\\"<br /> Page creates an edgy, humorously twisted Boston just left of center, with vanishing restaurants, invisible cigar-smoking hitmen, and the exotic \\"artiste\\" Violet. One of my favorite sequences is when Frank and Ryan must navigate the layers of bureaucracy and nepotism in order to meet the mayor and District Attorney.<br /> The mystery also features Frank receiving packages from a secret source, leading him deeper into his quest to come to terms with his past.<br /> The novel was well paced, with crisp dialogue and a number of well-orchestrated action scenes. The humor worked best when it was not forced, with a few bits just not working like having a partner die from being hit on the head by an anvil. The suspension of disbelief only works if it's not too over the top.<br /> There were also some details I would have liked to know, like more about Frank's past, why he changed his name and whether he had the same style, clothes and car when he was a human. I'll look for those in the next book of the series? And what was Ryan's full name?	2003-10-13

If this had been the first Burke book for me, I would have rated it higher.<br />The main plot involves Billy Bob defending his illegitimate son against a murder charge in a fishy-smelling situation involving a rich kid deviant with fetal alcohol syndrome and speed on the brain, a former football hero, DEA officers, and a sociopath named Garland T. Moon.<br />The inner plot involves Billy Bob wrestling with ghosts and demons from his past, namely private conversations he has with his old partner from their Texas Ranger days. There is also some mystery surrounding the death of Billy Bob's father in 1965.<br />Burke does an excellent job weaving all of the plot threads together, and the characters are believable. His descriptions are spare and elegant, and he has the ability provide sensory detail in a few short sentences.<br />One word of warning is that the cast is a rogue's gallery, like other Burke novels, and features a very flawed protaganist, but one we can root for just the same. Still, we're in some dark territory here, and Burke's writing is edgy, graphic and not for everyone.<br />While the book was well-written, I didn't get enough distance between Dave Robicheaux and Billy Bob Holland, who are essentially the same character. Both are men in their forties who stay in good shape, have father issues, and share similar demons in their past. The same self-righteous attitude was evident in both men. I hope that Billy Bob's voice takes a different shape in future novels of this series.<br />The other problem is that Burke is starting to recycle some of his details. The wealthy southerners always hold glasses wrapped with paper napkins secured with a rubber band. He's used this one a lot. There's also one where the night smells of fish spawning that's been used multiple times.<br />Still, this was a gripping read filled with tension on every page that made me want to know what was going to happen next.that made me want to know what was going to happen next.	2003-09-12

Maggie and Father Murphy have an immediate chemistry, and his struggle with his vows creates plenty of tension throughout the book.<br />The third protaganist is Peter Tobin, John Costello's best friend, also a talented artist and very confused young man.<br />All three suspect foul play in the death of John Costello, and their separate investigations lead them to link the deaths of a prominent judge, a waitress, and several boys that died years earlier at the school.<br />The book is full of suspense and tension on every page, which kept me reading. I enjoyed the details of the college, and found the characters sympathetic. As the pieces come together, the part about the saints is well done and creates an interesting twist as we learn connections with each character's name.<br />I thought that too much was given away too early, and I guess the villain's identity right away. His voice was just too false and too much like Eddie Haskell from &quot;Leave it to Beaver.&quot; I didn't trust him, so I wondered why the characters had no doubts, although he was carefully seducing them by playing on their grief and fears. Also, the villain's motive is never made clear, other than he's a sociopath. There is no depth to why he is carrying out his crimes.<br />The story is also an indictment of life at a Catholic seminary, with alcoholics, egotists, and closeted and not-so-closeted homosexuals thrown together in a modern Gothic setting.<br />Still, the book was well-paced and pulled me into the bizarre world.zarre world.	2003-09-04

He turned some fresh similes, and while the story was mostly character driven, there was tension and conflict throughout that kept the story moving.<br />I felt that it did sag a bit in the middle when Grady and James went to Grady's in-laws to celebrate the Jewish holiday Seder, and it's funny because that entire part was written out of the movie version.<br />Yes, the movie version was good as well, excellently cast with Michael Douglas as Tripp, Tobey Maguire as James Leer, Robert Downey as the lecherous Crabtree, and Frances McDormand as Sara, Tripp's lover.<br />Great book that I will probably reread at some point, and I'm looking forward to digging into Chabon's other works.	2003-08-21

Rowling has done an amazing job of advancing the basic Harry vs. Voldemort plotlines, while developing the central characters and introducing new allies and enemies.<br />Harry, now fifteen, has entered adolescence full of teen angst and emotion, questioning the adults in his life as to why they continue to withhold information from him. At times difficult, whiny and self-absorbed, young Harry is determined to prove to the doubting wizarding community that you-know-who is indeed back from the beyond. Rowling throws enough obstacles in Harry's way to keep the story interesting, including the latest Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, Madame Umbridge, a truly vile and horrible character. Harry also must deal with Ron as the new keeper on the Quidditch team, loads of schoolwork, a nasty punishment in detention, Malfoy as a prefect for Slytherin, and the loss of a friend.<br />Along the way, we get new development into Harry's Aunt Petunia, plus we see growth in Neville Longbottom, as well as Ron Weasley. Fred and George are up to their old tricks, but they grow as well. I would like to see more from Hermione than just the know-it-all bookworm, and she does loosen up throughout the book, but she can be grating as well.<br />While the book is long, and could have done with a bit of trimming here and there, Rowling succeeds by having conflict on every page, and keeping the story moving with new challenges to the young wizards.<br />Adults may fine the black and white distinctions trying, but consider the true audience of these books and what they want out of this series.<br />Probably the best sequence is where Harry learns some interesting information about Professor Snape and James Potter.<br />Read and enjoy!	2003-08-19

Using interviews with childhood pals, teammates, opponents, and other associates, Leavy pieced together an intriguing portrait of a man that the press has over-analyzed for being &quot;enigmatic,&quot; &quot;aloof&quot; and &quot;reclusive.&quot;<br />I liked how the chapters alternated between Koufax' perfect game in September 1965 and the story of his life. Leavy did an excellent job of painting the picture around the life, with details of Brooklyn in the fifties, and life in the Dodgers organization. The perfect game of 1965 was woven into the fabric of the turbulence that had occurred in Los Angeles that summer and with what was to come.<br />Koufax had six so-so years, then six years where he was the best pitcher in baseball, and established records that were all the more amazing when one considers the state of his left arm. The man used his time, and used it well, and when he had to, he walked away from the game, at only thirty years old.<br />The book covers primarily his teen years and baseball career, with a final chapter or two on his life after baseball. If you're looking for a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; glimpse into Koufax' life, this is not that kind of book. It is an attempt to separate myth and legend from reality, and to show that Mr. Koufax was just a great pitcher, and a person like the rest of us.	2003-08-01

As I read the book, however, I began to wonder if it had actually been written by Hillerman.<br />The plot involves Washington, D.C. politicos involved in drug-running between Mexico and the U.S. There is some soap-boxing about missing royalties owed Native American tribes from the U.S. government, and a couple honorable assassins thrown in to spice things up.<br />The setup is interesting enough, with a man sent out to the Four Corners region to do some investigating, shot in the back, and then a follow-up investigation by Sgt. Jim Chee. Meanwhile, Chee's would-be girlfriend has become Border Patrol Officer Manuelito down in the bootheel of New Mexico. In fact, most of the action in the story is done by Bernie, although Leaphorn figures out most of the details with his powers of deduction and a couple maps. Chee just kind of ties things together.<br />What disappointed me is that although the characters are moving along, the spirit seems to have gone out of Hillerman's writing. The vivid details of the landscape and geography are missing, along with the spirituality of Chee. Most of the Navajo cultural notes that made the earlier novels interesting are just kind of hinted at and it is assumed that the reader has read the other works. If this was the first Hillerman mystery I picked up, I would probably skip the rest.	2003-07-21

We learn on page one that the central characters have committed a murder, but the intrigue is finding out why. What happened to lead up to the murder of the supposed friend, Bunny Corcoran? What happened to the characters after the murder?<br />The narrator, Richard Papen, moves from California and tries to recreate himself at a liberal arts college in Vermont. He eventually breaks into the tight circle of a group of elitist Greek scholars and their instructor, Julian Morrow. There is a good deal of character study and observation as Richard interacts with the group, both as a unit and individuals. There is Henry, the leader and self-styled intellectual. Francis is the frail hypochondriac and barely closeted homosexual. Fraternal twins, Charles and Camilla, are the fair-haired amongst the dark. Charles is prone to excessive drinking, while Camilla masks her emotions with a frosty exterior. Finally, there is Bunny, the obnoxious nouveau riche sponge who bleeds the others until they resort to murder.<br />The murder of Bunny is only the center of the story. The spiraling descent of Richard, Henry, Francis, Charles and Camilla is what makes the story interesting.<br />These are not people I would have liked in college, wearing suits all the time, and moving about in their exclusive, arrogant, and pseudo-intellectual manner, but Tartt does present them as humans with good qualities and flaws. There is a certain Sophoclean irony in the way their lives turn out, and how some of the peripheral characters, like Cloke Rayburn and Judy Poovey, actually succeed after college.<br />The language is beautiful throughout, with excellent atmosphere in describing the college as the seasons change, and the small insights of the various cliques at the school. While one is following the plot of Richard and his group, there is also a sense that life is going on around them.

Lewis' \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" is an excellent introduction to fantasy realms for children between 10-12, but older kids and adults will enjoy this series as well. Lewis was a contemporary and colleague of Tolkien, but his series is geared more toward the young and has a strong Christian bent, as well as being much lighter in tone. There are strong themes of faith, honesty, love, giving and friendship in each book. While each book stands alone, there is a clear continuity and many characters reappear in more than one tale.<br />One of the things I really liked was that Lewis was able to introduce new heroes and supporting characters in each story and get the reader to like them as much as the previous set. I also liked that there was often also a lesson for one of the supporting characters, usually an animal or other non-human, to learn to be better, such as the horse Bree overcoming his vanity.<br />Moving through all of these stories is the great Lion Aslan, an enigmatic, spiritual being who helps the various characters discover strengths within themselves and overcome obstacles. Aslan is like a god/creator/deity who leads our heroes to greater wisdom.<br />Book 1: The Magician's Nephew features Digory and Polly and tells how they let the White Witch into the world of Narnia and how they met Aslan and witnessed the birth of Narnia.<br />Book 2: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. One of the most loved of the series, introduces the Pevensie children Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. Edmund experiences the greatest character arc and Aslan gives the greatest gift. Very strong Christian allegory in this tale.<br />Book 3: The Horse and His Boy. This is a tale during the Narnian golden age, and features a boy named Shasta and horse named Bree. They journey from Calormen to Archenland, so we see some of the other lands in the world of Narnia, and learn about the King of Archenland and his sons Cor and Corin, as well as a spunky young princess.<br />Book 4: Prince Caspian. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy return to Narnia, but centuries after their Golden Age, to aid Prince Caspian claim his rightful throne. There is a particularly moving sequence involving the four children's faith in Aslan.<br />Book 5: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Edmund, Lucy and their cousin Eustace Scrubb are pulled into Narnia to travel with Caspian as he journeys to the ends of the world in search of his father's loyal advisors. Eustace undergoes great changes in this story. Lots of strange and inventive realms here.<br />Book 6: The Silver Chair. This is the darkest of the series, where Eustace and new character Jill travel with the pessimistic Puddleglum (a Marsh-wiggle) into the wastelands and encounter the Green Witch and a mysterious prince, plus a Dante-like journey through Underworld.<br />Book 7: The Last Battle. When a false Aslan is spotted throughout the land, and great changes come to Narnia, Eustace and Jill return to aid King Tirian and the unicorn Jewel. This one is very heavy with Biblical parallels, along with the beginning of the end and the rebirth.<br />Read and enjoy!ter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy return to Narnia, but centuries after their Golden Age, to aid Prince Caspian claim his rightful throne.

His girlfriend has left town to deal with issues resulting from book three, and Harry is down in the dumbs. Enter Queen Mab, the Sidhe (faerie) Queen of Winter, with a case for Harry: Find out who killed the Summer Knight. Harry becomes the emissary of Winter.<br />We see the first gathering of the White Council, and learn some of Harry's allies, such as his second mentor, Ebenezer, along with enemies like Morgan and The Merlin. There is also the shadowy Gatekeeper.<br />With a battle brewing between the White Council of Wizards and the Red Court of vampires, the wizards need safe passage through the Nevernever world of the faeries. However, there is also a struggle between the faeries of Summer and Winter. Harry must solve the murder and power struggle or be handed over to the vampires by the White Council. There's a lot at stake for poor Harry.<br />Luckily, Dresden has some allies on the Council, and enlists the aid of the young Alphas, the werewolves from book two. He also begins to regain his friendship with Lt. Karrin Murphy of the Chicago police Special Investigations unit. They have a couple key scenes, including one that involves a fight with an ogre, a ghoul and a plant-monster at a WalMart.<br />Add to all of this the return of Harry's first lover, the wizard Elaine, plus the various faeries, and we get the makings for a bit of intrigue.<br />As with his other books, the story is well-paced, with plenty of action along with plot development. Harry's use of magic is always interesting, and his humor carries him (and the reader) through some of the darker periods. There is a good balance of levity with shadow. Harry's character continues to develop, and his talk with Lt. Murphy is a major step forward for him. For the other characters, we mostly see them through Harry's viewpoint, but the way they react to him also reflects some development, if only at a minimal level.<br />Some of the things I bumped on were the way that characters seem to disappear for large chunks of time. Michael Carpenter, Harry's ally from book three, isn't even mentioned this time. Also the identity of the murdered was no big surprise, but here the who is not as important as the why. There are plenty of twists and surprises to keep a reader guessing.<br />With book five due out soon, I can only wonder what adventures will come Harry's way next. Will he be able to help Susan? What will become of Elaine? The vampires loom at the edge of twilight, but I suspect that Harry Dresden will be ready.a minimal level.<BR>Some of the things I bumped on were the way that characters seem to disappear for large chunks of time.

Digory accidentally wakes the evil Queen Jadis and the children bring her back to London, where she begins to wreak havoc before they can get her back into the Wood. They also bring Uncle Andrew, a cabby and a horse named Strawberry.<br />They go to another world and witness a type of genesis, as a new world is born, called Narnia, with the lion Aslan as its king. Digory must go on a quest for a silver apple and return with it to Narnia. I won't spoil the rest.<br />The story begins as a fantastical fairy tale, and even though it's a children's book, there is a lot of depth for grown up children. As the land of Narnia unfolds, there are a lot of biblical currents, such as Aslan the creator, Jadis the temptress and the silver apples as the focal point of healing and knowledge.<br />It's a fun story, rich in dialogue and description, but well-paced and orchestrated and worth repeated reading.	2003-05-03

Jim Butcher definitely raises the bar with \\"Grave Peril,\\" the third installment of \\"The Dresden Files.\\" I gave this one four stars as a comparison to books of the genre, not all books.<br />The basic premise has Harry running around Chicago trying to find out why so many ghosts and spooks have breached the barrier between our world and that of the 'Nevernever' where all kinds of creatures reside. The story ties in a previous case involving a sorceror, as well as an extended sequence at the vampire's masquerade ball. During the course of the adventure, those close to Harry are either possessed or attacked in some way by a spirit dubbed 'The Nightmare' and even Harry succumbs at one point.<br />What I like about this series is the mixture of horror, mystery and dark comedy. The plots have improved with each book, although they always seem to be personal involving Harry in some way. I like his descriptions of the various entities, and the rules that bind them. Harry gets a new ally in Michael Carpenter, a sort of holy knight with a special sword, although no explanation is given how these two got together. Harry's love interest, Susan, also has a strong role. Murphy has a couple key scenes, but she's out of the way much of the book. There are also various shadow characters such as Thomas the vampire, Lydia with Cassandra's Tears, Justine the victim, Lea the fairie 'sidhe' godmother of Harry, and enemies like the evil Kravos, and vampire siblings Kyle and Kelly. Bianca is both the sexiest and foulest vampire one will ever meet.<br />Since the narration is told from Harry's point of view, we never get a lot of development of the other characters, but their outward emotions are clear, even if one never quite knows what trick they might pull next. Harry, on the other hand, is developing into a balanced character, with admirable traits and flaws like anyone. He is full of emotion, and tries to do what's right, but he recognizes his own shadow side.<br />As usual, the sensual descriptions of magic are interesting, and the extended action at the vampire party is a page-turner. Butcher paints the characters into a corner time and again, and manages to let them figure interesting ways out of their predicaments. Harry not only uses magic, but also his brain and body.<br />In the end, their is both a sense of finality and continuity, as the plot is resolved, but the story of Harry and his friend's (and enemies) lives will figure into future tales.l descriptions of magic are interesting, and the extended action at the vampire party is a page-turner.

The Man in the High Castle takes place in a North America radically different than the one we know. Written in 1962, Philip K. Dick's vision is less science fiction that alternative fiction. The east coast is controlled by the Third Reich, the west by the Japanese, and the mountain states are all that remains of the old America.<br />Dick makes an interesting case, with his blend of historical and fictitious Axis and Allies characters that shaped the destiny of the world. He doesn't go into a lot of futuristic gadgetry, mostly just rockets that can take humans to the moon and Venus and Mars, along with a forty-five minute trip from Berlin to San Francisco. He hints at the experiments conducted by the Nazis, such as the draining of the Mediterranean Sea and the African atrocity.<br />What really makes this book stand out is the characters and how they are linked through this story. We see Robert Childan, a dealer in items of \\"historicity\\" and closet racist. There's Mr. Tagomi, a conservative but open-minded businessman who has a defining moment with an \\"antique\\" revolver and a bit of nouveau jewelry. Frank Frink is a Jew who has evaded the Holocaust and goes into business with a friend, making the new style of jewelry. His ex-wife, Juliana, embarks on a quest to find the writer of a popular, but controversial book, the titular \\"Man in the High Castle.\\" Their lives are intertwined, along with their belief in the oracle of the I Ching and the attachment of value to things that belonged, or could have belonged, to someone famous or to a famous period. The past is linked to the present and future.<br />The story traces their lives, along with subplots involving the change of the German high command and a Swedish businessman who may not be all that he appears.<br />I liked the book because it's a thinker, one that makes you question how things might have been, how they are, and how they could be, along with variations if key events or people had not made certain choices of action.

It's an interesting application on everything from the bat and ball, the field, the offense and defense, lineups and strategies of the game. The book is also full of easy to understand symbols and charts.<br />Understanding is easy, but mastery is difficult, just as baseball is an easy game to learn but difficult one to master.<br />I especially liked the breakdown of the offensive batting order and the defensive alignment with the names and descriptions. For example, the pitcher is the creator, the father and extreme yang of defense. The catcher is the receiver, the mother and most yin of defense. Remember, it's all about balance. On offense the lineup is broken down into its archetypes, such as the number three hitter, Chen the arouser, the first son, Thunder. The third hitter is the second-best hitter on the team and perhaps best overall hitter.<br />These descriptions are helpful to newer fans and veterans alike.<br />I also enjoyed the coaching and playing strategies. These are such simple rules, like \\"place the team first,\\" \\"learn from your mistakes\\" and \\"be moderate from beginning to end.\\" Yet, time and again they are forgotten by managers and teams during play.<br />There's a lot here for players and coaches of all ages and levels, plus umpires, fans and even for outside baseball in everyday life. \\"Do not be afraid of hard work,\\" \\"avoid superstition,\\" and \\"accept defeat and victory equally.\\"<br />What I didn't like:<br />Toward the end the book got preachy, with narrator intrusion and opinions on the designated hitter, domes, turf and politics. Even if he was right, it strayed from the philosophical to the soap box.<br />In the end, however, we return to the Tao. I recommend this book for both the Yang and the Yin of the ball and the bat.d from the philosophical to the soap box.<BR>In the end, however, we return to the Tao.

Werewolves!<br />Dresden, Chicago's only openly practicing professional wizard, must reestablish his friendship with Murphy, and build his growing relationship with Susan, a beautiful tabloid journalist.<br />Also included are gangster John Marcone, a quartet of intense FBI agents, two gangs called the Alphas and the Streetwolves, a cursed Scottish philanthropist and the mysterious Tera West.<br />It's enough for a fast-paced, intense read that is both graphically violent but balanced with the levity of Dresden's self-deprecating sense of humor.<br />Things I liked:<br />Dresden's character improves from the first book and I liked his inner monologue. I do like that he uses his wits and body in addition to magic. When Harry has a conversation with his inner self, while he's knocked out, a lot of information comes to the surface and he takes a leap forward in development.<br />As I mentioned earlier, there was a good mix of levity with the suspense, which helps because this is a very violent story, especially the second half of the book, which is an extended string of action sequences, in the police department, in dark garages, and climaxing at Marcone's estate.<br />I liked making potions with Bob and the fun ingredients.<br />I enjoyed learning about the different types of werewolves.<br />The plot of Fool Moon flowed much better than Storm Front, with more related subplots and loose ends thrown in about Dresden's family, Marcone, Murphy, Susan, etc. that gave a sense of continuity to the series.<br />My bumps:<br />I wanted to smack Harry for being overprotective and for withholding information from his friends. He needs allies. He also always seems to get beat up and lose his clothes. He's intelligent but not very wise sometimes.<br />My questions:<br />What about Harry's father and mother?

Most people are surprised when they learn that those movies were based on novellas by horror master, Stephen King, but he shows that he's not just into scaring the heck out of you.<br />The story cycle bases one novella per season, and each follows characters on a journey, whether it's one of hope, descent into corruption, coming of age, or life through offspring.<br />\\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\" takes place over decades, as a prison inmate retains his spirit and soul, while breathing life into a dark institution, and whose patient nature finally leads him to freedom. The story is told in first person from the point of view of old Red, the guy who can get you things, about Andy Dufresne, a young banker jailed for the murder of his wife and her lover.<br />One of Kings great strengths is creating a believable voice for his characters, and as you read this tale, it is like Red is talking to you. Other King strengths are providing back story and creating a world in which these characters live, one with a past, present and future, and it makes them three dimensional. One of Kings flaws is going off on tangents and digressions a bit too often, but he always comes back to the story.<br />The Body (basis for Stand By Me) is a coming of age story about four small town boys on the cusp of entering Junior High School. On the Friday before Labor Day, they set off to find the body of a missing boy. One of the four boys, Vern Tessio, overheard his brother talking to a friend about the dead body.<br />The characters fall into several categories: Gordon LaChance, who narrates the story as an adult, is the dreamer/writer whose older brother died earlier that year. Chris Chambers is athletic, tough but smart. wise beyond his years and the white sheep in a family of black sheep. Teddy Duchamp is the psycho wiseguy who wears thick glasses and hearing aids as the result of his war veteran father putting his head to a stove. Vern Tessio is the least intelligent, but plays a key symbolic part as the one tells the others about the body and also is the first to spot it.<br />Along their journey, the boys encounter adventures, such as Milo Pressman the junkyard operator and his dog, Chopper. There is a run across a high trestle as a train bears down on them, a swim in a culvert full of leeches, and a night in the dark woods with screaming wild animals. When they eventually reach the boys, they have a run in with a group of teenage hoods from their town. A major difference from the movie, is that this story details the aftermath of the confrontation after the boys return to town.<br />King does a nice balancing act with his adult narrative and pre-adolescent dialogue, making each voice unique and fleshing out each boys character to make them multi-dimensional. All four experience growth, but Gordon and Chris take this growth with them as they get older. Dont let people drag you down. Theres a lot more to this story than just kids looking for a dead body.<br />My bumps here are again that King goes off on tangents and digressions, some to fill in background and history for the characters, but sometimes really straying far from the course. At one point he takes nearly a page to say that someone is dead, where The kid was dead. The kid wasnt sick, the kid wasnt sleeping. Would probably have sufficed.<br />I wont go into a lot of detail about the other two stories. Apt Pupil is about a boy who discovers a Nazi war criminal living in his town, and blackmails the old man into telling him stories about the war in exchange for not blowing the whistle on him. The stories the boy hears slowly lead him into senseless acts of violence. In The Breathing Woman a disgraced woman is determined to triumph over death.<br />These four stories combine to make an interesting cycle, and demonstrate that Stephen King has writing talents that stretch beyond his horror work.a disgraced woman is determined to triumph over death.<br />These four stories combine to make an interesting cycle, and demonstrate that Stephen King has writing talents that stretch beyond his horror work.	2003-03-25

Roberts &quot;A Short History of the World&quot; covers a lot of ground in 500 pages, from the earliest hominids to the early 1990s. The book provides concise details on the major civilizations that have impacted our world, and more importantly, the lasting impact these civilizations had on their descendants and other civilizations. One can trace our current world conflicts back through thousands of years and realize there is no easy solution to the many problems that confront us.<br />While Roberts gave attention to Asian civilization, his writing did come off with a pro-Western, pro-British slant, especially in his description of the early Islamic movement as one of &quot;conquest and expansion.&quot; The same could be said of Christian nations.<br />With such a wealth of information to process and absorb, I whittled away at this book over several months.

Throw in locations in San Francisco, Amsterdam, Paris and Africa, and you get globe-trotting action with plot twists that keep you guessing until the end.<br />I enjoyed &quot;Diamond Lies&quot; and found the map legend to be an interesting device in the role it played with John Erickson's quest to find his one true love. The novel was fast-paced and well-written, and the characters were multi-dimensional, even the villains Barzan and Moto. The subplots were effective as well, involving the lives of the elder Erickson's, and the environmental message that gave multiple sides of the issue.<br />There was some temporal weirdness with the prologue, which bothered me. Also, the Teri Clark character came across as insecure and high maintenance, and somewhat irritating. I would have liked more physical description of the characters. I also wanted more sensual atmosphere of the various locations, especially in the Africa section.<br />There were a number of sequences that were stunning, including a key action scene involving a river, wildebeests, and range rovers. I won't spoil it, but this part was as intense and exciting as anything I've read.<br />I'm looking forward to Johann Sorenson's next novel, and I recommend this one for fans of international adventure.	2003-03-17

We get to see Harry's life on multiple levels, as he works an outside job, and inside job, and attempts to deal with various issues in his personal life, such as dating, annoying faeries, and trouble with the unseen White Council.<br />I found the story intriguing, and although somewhat derivative, there were some interesting spins in creating a hard-boiled gumshoe wizard.<br />In creating a back story for Harry Dresden, author Jim Butcher has done a good job. In reading the book, I can tell that details of Harry's life have been thought out, that he has a family tree, there are rules to magic, and he has a history with his mentor. The White Council, while unseen, is represented by Morgan, a cross between a probation officer and grand inquisitor, and Dresden's nemesis. There are several sequences involving magical talismans, spells, potions and such that were interesting, and acceptable as far as magical realism.<br />Now for the bumps, and there were more than a few.<br />Another reviewer already commented on the issue of the canister and how Harry came to get it. I wondered also, why give it up so easily?<br />There was a very basic temporal gaff, when the day is referred to as Friday when it's already Saturday, and this is not just nit-picking because the day sequence is integral to the plot and Harry's fate.<br />Also, the plot just didn't hold together well, like the author was trying to do too much and tie things together with some implausible coincidences. He's called in to investigate a murder involving some mob guy and a woman, which leads him to connections with a more powerful mob guy selling drugs, and then into a connection with a black wizard peddling a drug that allows users to glimpse through the 'Third Eye' and eventually it's all a setup? Please.<br />Dresden's relationship with Officer Murphy didn't fly either. Why doesn't he just talk to these people? How can she slap handcuffs on him after she's been poisoned by a dog-size scorpion? Why does she think he's the killer? This just irritated me.<br />Morgan the wizard also thought Harry was the killer, and this bugged me because I thought the White Council would at least have some sense on who's using what kind of powers.<br />I had no problem finishing the book, because it was a quick read, and I'm interested enough in the big picture story to read the next one, but I hope the story plotting is better.selling drugs, and then into a connection with a black wizard peddling a drug that allows users to glimpse through the 'Third Eye' and eventually it's all a setup?

There he plans to follow his dream of writing a novel.<br />Part 2 takes us to Jamaica, and the new life and friends that Seth finds there, as romance and adventure unfold, and Seth faces his greatest challenges.<br />Things I liked about the book:<br />The writing is full of humor, and I found myself smiling and even laughing out loud at times as I read. The dialogue is crisp and the character interactions have the illusion of reality. The story, while initially character driven, built as the book moved along, but the characters always kept things interesting. The plot ended up having some unexpected twists and turns. There was a definite journey undertaken by Seth, with obstacles, friends, allies, enemies and mentors, although the biggest obstacle for Seth was himself. I also liked that this was a story written by someone of the \\"tween generation\\" that is not quite baby boomer and not quite generation X, so I could identify with it.<br />The descriptions gave me that feeling that I was there in the scene with the characters. Ehrens has a nice touch with detail.<br />The thing that truly made the book worthwhile was the characters, most of whom were well-drawn, with good qualities and flaws. Seth, Shulie, Emma, Erika, Freedy, Diego, Alfred and even Dugan all had their moments.<br />Criticisms:<br />The writing is very self-aware at the beginning, trying too hard to be cute and funny. The initial monologue was chatty and there wasn't much plot, just a miserable guy ranting about everyone. Although, with the terrible people he encountered, the ranting was not always unjustified. There was also this attempt at being a Holden Caulfield/Catcher in the Rye type, that I wish new writers would just stop trying right now. Also, the first person narrative seems very close to what I might suspect from Mr. Ehrens. I imagine that there are a lot of similarities between Seth Gold and Ron Ehrens.<br />Big Bumps:<br />There was one instance of out of point of view foreshadowing (Dugan knew...) that jumped out at me. The book was also full of bad editing, with \\"repore\\" instead of \\"rapport,\\" \\"shown\\" instead of \\"shone,\\" and \\"Columbia\\" instead of \\"Colombia\\" all appearing more than once, and those are just a few examples. The writer should not be faulted for this. The book could have used better editing.<br />To conclude, I thought that Seth's defining moment in the book showed excellent emotional range, but he was unemotional when a certain tragedy took place. Maybe he had prepared for it, or didn't really care. You'll have to read the book and decide.<br />I hope to read another work by Ron Ehrens, to see if he can capture the voice of different characters and prove my Seth/Ron theory wrong.Seth, Shulie, Emma, Erika, Freedy, Diego, Alfred and even Dugan all had their moments.<BR>Criticisms:<BR>The writing is very self-aware at the beginning, trying too hard to be cute and funny.

We learn the customs, see the people both struggle and prosper with their farming, and watch as Okonkwo rises to prominence within his group.  Determined not to become like his ne'er do well but well-liked father, Okonkwo is a hard worker, ambitious leader, but cruel to his family.  As the story unfolds, he allows his pride and sense of duty to tradition overcome what in his heart he knows must be wrong.  There is a moving portion involving an adopted son from a rival village where the reader suspects that a tragic outcome awaits.<br />Eventually, an accident, but serious transgression, results in his exile from the village.  Okonkwo remains determined to return and take his place among the tribal leaders, but then the white men arrive with their new religious ideas.<br />This is one of those books that you wonder about as your reading, until you've completed it and then realize you have to read it again to catch all of the ideas between the lines.<br />Okonkwo is a well-drawn character, full of strengths and character flaws that make this novel compelling.<br />It's a thinker.	2003-02-07

Having secured shogun Tsunayoshi's favor in the first book, Sano has been elevated to \\"sosakan\\" level, kind of the chief investigator to the court.  The main mystery plot involves a killer who is collecting \\"bundori\\" war trophies based on a century-old betrayal of the first shogun, Oda Nobunaga.<br />Sano must find the killer, while avoiding the wrath of the jealous chamberlain Yanagisawa, the allure of the mysterious priestess/ninja Aoi, and a host of uncooperative samurai and citizens.<br />Strengths:<br />Throughout the book are colorful descriptions of old Edo (now Tokyo) that give a sense of place.  Rowland evokes the five senses, as well as inner senses with respect to atmosphere.  I liked that there was action in the city aside from the investigation, such as the riots and resulting fire that burned throughout the latter portion of the book.  This gave me the idea that there were other things happening outside the life of Sano.  Rowland gives detailed physical descriptions of characters.  Her use of history and cultural notes pulls one into the period.  I also liked the sexual tension between Sano and Aoi, with love interest possibilities, plus the addition of the loyal Hirata as a sidekick.<br />Work areas:<br />The mystery ends up not nearly as compelling as the numerous subplots that surround it.  As an antagonist, Yanagisawa basically has no redeeming qualities.  There were times when Sano, an educated and intelligent man, acted so thickheaded that I wanted to throttle him.  While the sensual details worked, Rowland needs work on showing emotions rather than telling them.  There were also instances of someone saying something in Japanese, then translating it themselves into English, such as \\"Okashii ridiculous.\\"  I also can't let slide this gem of dialogue:  \\"Dirty saboteur!  Who are you working for, you agent of evil and darkness?\\"<br />Still, I enjoyed the period detail and the pacing was gripping, keeping me moving the story.  I'm looking forward to watching these characters grow and eager to find out what happens next.gripping, keeping me moving the story.

Books	4	11	12	N	N	Insights into lives and creative process of The Beatles	If you only buy one book on the Beatles, this is as good as any.  I found it immensely readable, and had trouble putting it down.  It's one of the few books I've read more than twice.  Hertsgaard gleaned much of his information from old interviews with the Beatles and those of their inner circle such as producer George Martin and sound engineer Geoff Emerick, along with Neil Aspinall, Derek Taylor, and many others, as detailed in the nearly 100 pages of notes.<br />What comes out is a nuanced telling of the Beatles story, much of it already known to fans, but with the addition of notes on the recording session and almost every song they recorded, along with tunes like &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; that showed up on bootlegs and many that appeared in the Anthology Series.<br />After each chapter, I found myself popping in a disk and listening on the headphones to discover things on the songs I'd never noticed before.<br />A worthwhile read.	2003-02-02

A group decides to intervene with Christopher Columbus, change the outcome of his journey, and thereby alter the history of life in the Western Hemisphere and even the entire world.<br />I thought this was a compelling narrative.  The plot drew me in and kept me reading, but the challenges of altering the past also made me stop and consider the ramifications.  Even if we could, is it ethical to alter history?<br />Positives:<br />I like the mix of history, science fiction, anthropology, religion and environmentalism.  The character of Columbus is very dynamic, experiencing a hero's journey with peaks and valleys, and he comes out of it a changed man.  He also comes across as three-dimensional, unlike most of the other characters in the story.  The whole idea of pastwatch was fascinating, as well as the various histories of the peoples in Mexico/Yucatan, etc.  Card must have done a lot of research, or his fictional histories are very convincing.<br />Criticisms:<br />We never really see the world of the future.  Everyone is always looking at pastwatch, so it's as if they have no real lives.  Relationships are given as summaries.  There are no sensual details.  Physical descriptions are minimal.  The fact that the earth is nearly beyond repair is not revealed until over halfway through the book.  The most glaring technical error is with point of view.  We go from watching via pastwatch, to suddenly being part of the past, and then with a mix of third and first person narrative.<br />Great ideas, very interesting story, but I would have liked more depth and clearer point of view transitions.	2003-01-30
US	46959417	R1IO9NHBHIE9H4	0140185003	179354174	The Quiet American (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)	Books	4	10	11	N	N	A subtle thinker...and insight into Viet Nam conflict	Graham Greene's \\"The Quiet American\\" was published in 1955, but it has an almost eerie prophetic quality about what was to happen in Viet Nam.  This novel will soon be a film featuring Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser.<br />While the French are trying to stave off the Chinese and Viet Minh communist threat and hold on to their colony in Indochina, a young American idealist enters the scene.  Pyle, with his prep school values in hand, begins to fund a \\"Third Force\\" based on writings by his intellectual idol, York Harding.<br />We see the action through the eyes of Fowler, an aging, cynical British reporter, determined not to become engaged or emotionally involved in the conflict.  Fowler has plenty of issues.  He's trapped in a loveless marriage to a woman back home, smokes too much opium, and has a convenient relationship with a young Vietnamese woman named Phuong.<br />Phuong becomes the object of contention between Pyle and Fowler, and the conversations the two men have regarding the woman and her country provide amazing insights into the attitudes about Indochina.<br />Greene's novel is very character driven, yet there is also plenty of action, as well as discourse on the nature of the conflict.  Fowler is a vivid personality, undergoing some intense changes throughout the story, leading to key events that cause him to become involved.<br />The book is less than two hundred pages, but it leaves the reader with plenty to think about upon completion.  A very satisfying read.	2003-01-08

The man has lost his daughter and with withi a year of each other, and has embarked on a solo motorcycle trip across Canada to Alaska as part of the healing process.<br />This book will appeal to travelers, motorcycle enthusiasts, Rush fans, those dealing with loss in their lives, and anyone interested in a fascinating journey.<br />The story unfolds on journeys of several levels, as Mr. Peart attempts to piece together his life while traveling across North America.  There are beautiful descriptions of nature, insights into locations visited, and travelogue details.  Yet this story is deeper and more personal than just a travel account.  We learn about Peart's family and friends.  Along his route, he learns that his dog has died and best friend, Brutus, has gone to prison.<br />We're right there with him when he crosses the arctic circle, when he dumps his bike on a bridge in Mexico, and when he's trying to get out of LA but can't resist turning around to go see a certain person.<br />Peart lets us inside his head, and life, with details of his life as a drummer, lyricist, writer, bicyclist, motorcyclist, birder, art lover, and avid reader.<br />The writing style includes prose narrative, letters to friends, and journal entries, as well as song excerpts appropriate to the writer's emotions at various stages of his journey.  I learned what was important to this man, as he rediscovered little by little what he still liked about his life, such as bird watching, reading, etc.  At times I was frustrated for him, but I cheered at his triumphs.  Peart holds nothing back, exposing his deepest challenges, unafraid to bear his soul, and we experience an entire range of character arc.<br />I know I'm enjoying travel essays when I get out a pencil and begin making stars in the margins by places the author visits that sound appealing to me.  I made a lot of marks in this book.  There were sidebars about personalities, such as Sam Hill and Jack London, that also merit further exploration.  That's another thing I like, if the author makes me want to learn more about something he/she has mentioned.<br />The narrative begins to drag a bit in part two, when the letters begin to overtake the prose and there is some repetition, but things pick up once the Ghost Rider hits the road again.<br />I won't spoil the ending, but I recommend this book, especially to those who have purchased &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; and want to get a better understanding to the thoughts behind the songs.ow I'm enjoying travel essays when I get out a pencil and begin making stars in the margins by places the author visits that sound appealing to me.

I like the &quot;exploring&quot; series because the guides have lots of maps, along with pictures, history, art, architecture, and interesting sidebars.<br />This guide gives an overview of all the main islands, with well-rounded information for all types of travelers.

Entries include the common name and scientific name, and you can enter dates, locations and remarks on your sightings.  Plenty of room is given for entries.  There are even occasional blanks for adding birds.  I used this to add species I identifed on trips to Japan.  Also included is a section on Hawaiian species, and accidental species not usually found in North America.<br />In the back is an appendix where you can enter your list, up to 828 birds!  There's also a useful alphabetical index, with page numbers and checklist.<br />There are no pictures, so you will need a field guide for identification.  I usually carry a notepad and make my entries when I come home.<br />A very handy guide.	2003-01-04
US	46959417	RVHQE80I9T7YC	1582790914	3124452	Signature Classics : A Christmas Carol	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A classic tale of Christmas	Most people in the western world are probably familiar with the tale of Ebeneezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens.  The story has been made into dozens of television and film versions, but I think the written version still stands above film.<br />Dickens' language is very descriptive, and he paints clear pictures of his characters.  Take Scrooge, for example:<br />&quot;Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!  Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire, secret and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.&quot;<br />Another strength of Dickens was showing the common man, sometimes with quiet dignity, as in the case of Bob Cratchit, and sometimes at his lowest, as in the case of the workers at the pawnbrokers hawking Scrooges goods.<br />The images of Jacob Marley's ghost &quot;wearing the chains he forged in life&quot; are very vivid, as are the souls that Scrooge sees out his window.<br />Scrooge is forced on a journey by three spirits, the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future.  All of the scenes have distinct images and evoke intense emotions within Scrooge.  The reader feels part of his change.  I never did quite understand why his father treated him so poorly, but that he did contributes to the man Scrooge becomes.<br />In the end, Scrooge is a changed man and goes out of his way to share his generosity.<br />I recommend this book for children and adults alike, because the story is timeless and Dickens practicallly defined the quintessential Victorian Christmas.  The name Scrooge and 'Humbug' will forever be linked, and the name has come to define someone miserly or without holiday spirit.<br />What day is it?<br />It's Christmas Day!	2002-12-17
US	46959417	RWKBQ3QLUAQB6	068485256X	95652864	The Last Temptation of Christ	Books	4	94	101	N	N	4.5 - An excellent fictional account on the life of Jesus	The Last Temptation of Christ is a fictional exploration of the life of one of history's most intriguing figures, Jesus Christ.  This is not revisionist history, merely an author's viewpoint on how the Son of the Carpenter may have lived his life.  It should be taken as a novel, and not a reinterpretation of the scriptures.<br />Nikos Kazantzakis presents Jesus as very human, a man struggling to ignore the voice of God while making the crosses that the Romans use for crucifiction execution.  The people around him think he is mad, and at first the story is frustrating as the reader wants the character to show some guts and follow his destiny.  Of course, what a destiny this turned out to be.  How many of us could have done what he was purported to have done?  That is the question, and as Jesus accepts that he is the Messiah, the story really gets moving.<br />This is not an easy read, both in its prose and its ideas.  There is a lot here to challenge people from all religious backgrounds.  Jesus is shown as a human, with human emotions and frailties, but it is this that makes for an interesting character arc in the presenation of the novel and the creation of a truly dynamic character.<br />Kazantzakis also provides beautiful description of the land of Jesus' birth and places we've read about in the Bible and heard of in the news.  Nazareth, Judea, Galilee, Samaria and Jerusalem come alive in these pages, full of Jews, Romans, Pharisees, Scribes and ragamuffins.<br />The character of Judas Iscariot is also interesting, a militant religious zealot who wants the Romans out of Israel.  In this story, he is the one follower that remains completely true to Jesus, and must accept the most difficult task given to him by Jesus.  The other apostles are shown as weak and ready to desert Jesus at the earliest threat of danger to their lives.<br />A challenging aspect of this book is the visions, and one is never quite sure if what a character is seeing is real, imagined or a vision from God.  A lot of strange things happen, and sections are full of Biblical symbolism so you might need to read sections twice or consult with the Gospels for clarity.<br />The scenes dealing with Satan are particularly bizarre, especially the period where Jesus is fasting in the desert.<br />Another interesting character is Mary Magdelene, a prostitute that scorns Jesus, then becomes one of his most ardent followers.  She figures in the last temptation, but more important are the sisters of Lazarus, Martha and Mary.  As Christ ascends the Cross, he experiences this last temptation and there is an interesting twist on temptations.  To me, this section was not nearly so blasphemous as \\"religious\\" folks have made it out to be.  They probably didn't actually read the book.<br />Here are a couple of my favorite passages:<br />\\"What are dreams, Rabbi?\\" she asked him softly.  \\"What are they made of?  Who sends them?\\"<br />\\"They are neither angels nor devils,\\" Jesus answered her.  \\"When Lucifer started his revolt against God, dreams could not make up their minds which side to take.  They remained between devils and angels, and God hurled them down into the inferno of sleep...\\"<br />Another<br />\\"A prophet is the one who, when everyone else despairs, hopes.  And when everyone else hopes, he despairs.  You'll ask me why. It's because he has mastered the Great Secret:  that the Wheel turns.\\"<br />The only major problem I had with the writing was that there was a lot of point of view shifting within scenes, so it sometimes became confusing whose head we were in during the scene.  One minute we're with Jesus, the next with John, then Peter, and so on.  I don't mind multiple points of view, but I prefer to stay with one character throughout the duration of a scene.<br />I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who wants to examine their beliefs from an alternate point of view other than the one taught by organized religion.sion from God.

They end up targeting an actress that portrayed and lesbian and an actor that portrayed an abortion doctor.<br />The novel takes jabs at the entertainment industry, cheesy private investigators, white supremacists in Idaho and far, far right-wingers on television.<br />There were a couple gaffs and plot holes that could have been fixed.  In one scene, a man is talking to a woman in her kitchen and a gun falls out of his pocket on to the floor, and she doesn't notice.  She gets shot, of course.  The worst one was a blatant lie of a red herring where a shadow character smiles into a phone for no other apparent reason than to be part of an evil plot.  Later, this character is innocent.  I felt cheated.<br />I hope the author will clean up some of these types of slips in his next work.  He shows promise as a thrill-writer and I can see his novels being optioned for screenplays.	2002-11-24

They flee to Venice, a city their mother loved and described to them in great detail.  There they meet up with other young urchins, Hornet, a girl with a long braid who loves books, Mosca, a boy who likes boats and Riccio, a pickpocket with crooked teeth.  They all live in an abandoned movie theatre and receive assistance from the mysterious Scipio, who steals from the wealthy homes of Venice.<br />Other characters include Victor Getz, a bumbling detective who the author describes as \\"looking like Bob Hoskins\\", Ida Spavenko, a kind-hearted woman photographer, and Barbarossa, a swindling antique shop owner.<br />The plot has the children eluding then befriending Victor, along with Scipio's quest for the big take, then a mysterious caper that propels the characters on a quest to a secret island in search of a magical merry-go-round.<br />The writing is simple and well-paced, probably best for kids ten to eleven, with plenty of action and comedy.  While not being entirely original, the book suffers from some of its surprises easily guess far ahead of time.  The characters are not given a lot of depth, although I liked Prosper and Scipio, I would have liked to have learned more about them.  Much of Scipio's background remained unclear, as well as his motives for helping the other children and his eventual transformation.<br />Prosper changes by not changing, and becomes the anchor of the story, the conscience and most sympathetic character.  He faces many choices, makes some mistakes, but comes out ahead by his own intelligence, the help of his friends, and a little luck.<br />One point that makes this story rise above other books is the author's attention to the details of Venice.  While not overwhelming young readers, there is enough to provide a clear picture of the city's canals, old building and many bridges.<br />Still, one cannot help but think that this is a movie treatment that will find it's way to the theatres eventually., there is enough to provide a clear picture of the city's canals, old building and many bridges.<br />Still, one cannot help but think that this is a movie treatment that will find it's way to the theatres eventually.	2002-11-18

The transition from lyricist to prose writer can be difficult, but Peart does an excellent job.  Before reading the book, I already had respect for the man, a rock and roll drummer, for going on a cycling tour in eastern Africa.  I would respect anyone for undertaking such a trip, and after reading the book, I respect him even more.<br />Peart's language is conversational throughout most of the book, as if he's relating the events over a drink at a pub.  Many of his insights probed much deeper when he explored the culture of the people of Africa in general and Cameroon in particular, offering comparisons to a previous journey he had made to west Africa.<br />We see the landscape through the writer's eyes as he cycles up hills and navigates dirt roads, rocks, gun-toting guards at checkpoints and the sometimes rewarding vantage points.  Each village or stopping point is described and I felt as if I was part of the journey.<br />In addition to the daily travels, we get Mr. Peart's reactions and thoughts to people that he encountered on his travels.  He does not try to gloss over personalities with stereotypes, but tries to present things as they are.  Yes, the country and continent has been exploited, but there is a strong victim mentality and Peart points out that Africans themselves participated in the slave trade.  All the problems of Africa did not originate from outside the country.<br />Yet there are also great moments of kindness experienced.  The woman who says \\"you are welcome,\\" the smiles from young children, or the family sharing its simple food with their guests.  I found the visits to the various missions particularly interesting, and the affect upon the writer of the nuns singing vespers is moving.<br />Mr. Peart also writes about his relationships with the other four members of his group.  David is their guide from Seattle, struggling to keep a good face while helping the slowest member of the group.  Elsa, a sixty-year old woman with facile new age sensibilities and a sour disposition, is the cancer of the group, constantly falling behind and complaining about everything.  Leonard is the stalwart Viet Nam veteran who remains an anchor throughout the book.  Annie is a twenty-something needy type who has a \\"good heart\\" but is not very thoughtful or considerate.<br />There were several clashes amongst these personalities, and I appreciated Mr. Peart's knowledge of his own shortcomings and self-analysis.  I would have liked to have seen a little more reaction of the other's toward him, but that is sometimes hard to capture or catalog unless one has a confidante within a group.  The author did not have this, and the book ends with some loose ends among the different riders, or maybe they were just ready to get away from each other.<br />Perhaps the most powerful thing about the book is the strong emotional arc experienced by the author, probably unexpected when he set out on his journey.  He begins with idealism intact, but after bouts of dysentary, an encounter with a drunken soldier armed with a gun, and an offical that tries to make off with his (and David's) passport, he truly undergoes some changes. There is a shift in attitude, but also a new appreciation of things taken for granted in developed countries.  By the penultimate chapter, I felt just as tired and sweaty, bruised and bloody, bitten and beaten and just plain exhausted as the writer.  The final chapter, his arrival in Paris to see his wife and get back to civilization, strikes quite a contract with his previous experience.<br />If I had to make a criticism, it would be that some parts were kind of soap box preachy, although I tended to agree with many of his views.<br />I'm looking forward to reading his next book, \\"Ghost Rider.\\"attle, struggling to keep a good face while helping the slowest member of the group.

US	46959417	R3NNBCPHIYWCDU	0553212478	655343360	Frankenstein	Books	5	6	7	N	N	The original Gothic horror classic	Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is one of the original Gothic horror classics, along with Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula.\\"<br />If you only know \\"Frankenstein\\" from the movie versions, this book will come as a surprise.  There is less detail on the creation, no criminal brain vs. normal brain, no Igor, no fabulous lightning storm, no bolts in the neck and no slow-moving gait.<br />In fact, Shelley's narrative begins with letters from an Arctic explorer, R. Walton, written to his sister.  Walton's passion for exploration is explained and his quest for companionship detailed.  Then, while his ship is trapped in the northern ice, he spots a creature crossing the ice.  Following the creature is a weakened man in a broken sledge.  Upon rescuing the man, Walton meets Victor Frankenstein, and so begins his tale.<br />We learn of Frankenstein's family background, upbringing in Geneva, early education and fascination with the nature of the world.  Upon entering university, he expands his knowledge of physical science and chemistry.  It is there that he begins construction of a being that he plans to bring to life.  Through Frankenstein's narrative, we begin to see his descent into an obsessive madness, more manic than maniacal, a bi-polar disorder of the nth degree.<br />The assembly and bringing to life are kept vague, probably because Shelley herself lacked the scientific knowledge, but cleverly veiled by Frankenstein's own admission, lest another try to duplicate his work.<br />Dr. Frankenstein succeeds, and when the creature awakens, Frankenstein is so repulsed that he abandons the creature and flees his laboratory.  He has a breakdown, and only the arrival of his best friend, Henry Clerval, brings him back to health.<br />What follows is Victor Frankenstein's demise through the machinations of the being he created.<br />I love Mary Shelley's language, so evocative of the time, full of color, passion and darkness.  The voices are very distinct, and we get to hear the creature's story of what happened when he was thrust into the world, cast away by the hand that created him.  The creature is far from the dull movie versions, in fact he is quite intelligent, mastering language by observing a family as he hides in a hovel next to their home, discovering the joys of music, and reading the work of John Milton.<br />But, he is alone and an outcast, and implores Dr. F to create a mate for him.  The Dr. denies him this request, taking a moral high road lest he should unleash a family of demons upon the world.<br />There is so much to enjoy here, from the lush detail of the travels of both the Dr. and the creature.  The range of emotions displayed by both make each sympathetic and pathetic at various stages.  There is also the strong message about violating the natural order and trying to play God.  One must be ready to face the consequences.  This is a powerful story.of what happened when he was thrust into the world, cast away by the hand that created him.

Yet his body has not been found.  Also, there is an issue with his father having left him an inheritance and his mother trying to claim him as a slave.  Throw in an opium addict brother, a shadowy uncle and a demon of a grandmother and you have the makings of another southern gothic mystery set in old New Orleans.  It's up to Benjamin January to find out what really happened to Jumon if he is to free his sister before she is hanged or taken with fever from the filthy jail, the notorious Cabildo.<br />It's another steamy summer and Ben is still recovering from injuries he suffered in \\"Fever Season.\\"  Money is hard to come by, with the music season slow and Ben being unable to earn a living as a doctor.  Yellow Fever, and perhaps even Cholera, are taking their toll on the population, and Ben must confront his deepest spiritual beliefs in a conflict of voodoo and Christianity.<br />I liked the further development of January and found him to be an excellent observer of his surroundings.  Although a man of deep moral conviction, he is full of conflict with his societal role, mourning for his dead wife, and challenged by the voodoo signs haunting his every turn.  His main ally continues to be Oxford educated, opium-addicted, Irishman Hannibal, slowly descending with consumption.  Rose Vitrac returns and their friendship continues to grow.<br />The complex web of families continues to be fascinating.  I would love a peek at Hambly's notebook detailing the genealogy of whites, blacks and colored, creoles and Americans, wealthy and poor, that she so aptly illustrates in her writing.<br />Her writing is very descriptive and one really gets a full range of senses, from the smell of the gutters to the detail of a house in the swamp.<br />At times, the detail can become overwhelming and drag parts of the story.  Also, I still would like a \\"cast list\\" to keep all of these people straight, as there are so many names, both American and French, that I sometimes forget who is who.  The sheer number of characters makes it difficult to keep them all straight.<br />Still, I am enjoying watching the growth taking place with Ben January, and look forward to the next book, \\"Sold Down the River.\\"tail of a house in the swamp.<br />At times, the detail can become overwhelming and drag parts of the story.

US	46959417	R1V8C4P5VRCX58	1587151022	332076815	Mystic Rhythms: The Philosophical Vision of Rush	Books	3	21	21	N	Y	Nice range of material covered...too many tangents	If you're looking for a book about Rush the band, this is not for you.  If you are looking for insights into the inspiration behind the lyrics, this book is a step in the right direction.<br />Carol Selby Price comes off as well-read, with a wide range of knowledge covering philosophy, religion, literature and pop culture.  She definitely is a fan of the music of Rush, but especially the lyrics of Neal Peart.  Don't expect a lot of coverage on the instrumental music here, this is strictly about the lyrics.<br />I found that the breakdown of theme categories and selection of titles worked from the standpoint that she covered from 2112 through Presto.  The book works best when clearly staying with the topic of a single song, then using some comparisons from literarture, etc.  If one were to merely listen to the songs, there would be a surface meaning, but this book helps dig deeper below the surface layer, peeling through the layers of allegory and metaphor to some core visions.<br />For example, while \\"Red Barchetta\\" appears to be a thumbing of the nose against the powers of a dystopic society, I never thought about the adventure merely being a dream by the fireside itself.  Did he actually drive the care or simply remain with his uncle by the fireside?<br />I liked the link of Analog Kid, Digital Man and New World Man, especially the inner/outer versions of New World Man comparing both individuals as well as the regions New World, Old World and Third World.<br />Criticisms:  There must have been a copyright issue with reprinting the lyrics, because one would need the album/disk package at hand to review the writing.  While there are plenty of quotes from other sources, the Rush songs are merely paraphrased.  I also would have liked to have the entire song broken down, instead of going off on a tangent to show comparisons with Kant, Plato, Nietzsche or Ayn Rand.  At times the writers appeared to be showing off their knowledge and there was some definite narrative preachiness about our society.  E.T. one long commercial for Reese's Pieces?  What does that have to do with Rush?<br />Some songs are covered briefly, such as 2112, which was then recovered in The Trees.  Some editorial tightening would have helped this book, but then again, at barely 150 pages, it was not that long a read.<br />I would recommend this book to Rush fans who are scholars and have read works by some of those in the bibliography.ness about our society.

US	46959417	R14D9M3RO863IL	0812570820	915491164	Prophecy: Child of Earth (Rhapsody, Book 2)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	An excellent sequel and bridge book in the series	Prophecy picks up where Rhapsody left off, with Rhapsody, Achmed and Grunthor in their newly established kingdom at Ylorc, but with many tunnels remaining to be explored and quests yet to be undertaken.<br />The series involves three people who escape various pursuers in their homeland by climbing along the root of the great tree that passes the \\"axis mundi\\" of their world.  They come out on the other side and discover that they have traveled several thousand years into the future, their homeland has been destroyed and the refugees have dispersed in the new land.<br />There are many fascinating premises here and I like the way Haydon fills her world with interesting races borne of elements.  The natural world is a powerful presence here and strongly affects the magic used by those who possess it, but in different ways according to their elemental background.  For example, Achmed is strongly attuned to the wind and can sense the vibrations of someone's heartbeat from miles away.  Rhapsody can affect fire.  Grunthor can pass through earth.  Ashe can move in water.<br />This is a very character driven book and series.  By keeping the number of central characters to a minimum, we get to know them better and learn their desires, fears and goals.  Rhapsody may be a little too perfect at times in the seemingly effortless way she picks up music, swordsmanship and magic, but she is also a flawed character trying to learn and improve herself.<br />The central plot also works as an effective mystery.  The group must find a demon (the F'dor) and the Rakshas (kind of an elemental possession creature) in its employ.  There are also a variety of political and religious forces at work and a broad an interesting group of sub-characters whose motives remain unclear.<br />My criticisms...<br />First, the typesetter or editors could have done a better job cleaning up the numerous errors in the book.<br />Rhapsody can get a bit irritating with her naivete, and the love scenes were a bit long.  There was one scene where Ashe asks her to sing him a song before continuing a conversation and I almost threw the book at a wall.  Quit stalling!<br />There were also a number of point of view shifts within scenes.  One moment we're in one person's head and paragraphs ping pong back and forth into someone else's head.<br />My biggest knock is having scenes with unseen villains.  This is a cheap writer's device and totally cheats the reader.  You have two people talking but we can't see them.  What's up with that?  Or one person identified and the other a mystery, even though the other can see them.  Put the reader in the scene or leave it out.<br />I am looking forward to the final book in the series, because I want to see how the story ends and what happens to the characters.  What will happen at Tristan's wedding?  Will Rhapsody remember...was one scene where Ashe asks her to sing him a song before continuing a conversation and I almost threw the book at a wall.

One of the main points of the book is that in striving to modernize, Japan has lost some (or most?) of its soul.  The country is so concerned with achieving superiority that the people live in cramped apartments and have an amazingly high cost of living compared to other countries.  Also, the bureucratic engine is systematically destroying the countryside by paving over rivers and building dams that are unnecessary, roads to nowhere and airports for radishes.<br />Having lived in Japan for over 2 years near the end of the bubble economy, I can attest that I agree with many of Mr. Kerr's points. While at times repetitive and preachy, he also comes across as one who truly loves Japan and counts himself a member of the \\"Chrysanthemum Club\\" of Japanophiles.  This is not Japan bashing.  Point after point is made about the government construction state's unstoppable building, the ministry of finance's botching of the economy, the education system training children to be obediant while filling their heads with useless facts, and the stagnation of research and development.<br />Do you wonder why Shoko Asahara and Aum Shinri Kyo could achieve what they did?  They provided state of the art research facilities to scientists whereas most universities are underfunded and out of date.<br />This book should be read by any person who has lived or studied in Japan or has any interest in the country or Asia in general.  I hope that the Japanese translation stirs some action, for as Mr. Kerr notes, change this time must come from within Japan and not from foreign pressure.<br />While reading the book I realized how many things I had taken for granted during my stay, while at other times he was right on the mark and I was nodding my head in agreement.  Yes, the government is corrupt.  Yes, there is always some type of building going on.  Yes, it's outrageously expensive.  Yes, the people there mostly look sleep deprived and are conditioned to be like children.<br />I look forward seeing more work by this author.g more work by this author.	2002-04-17

The story is one of a young baseball player overcoming his personal denial in his search for happiness and purpose to his life.<br />Mike Houle, a ballplayer fresh out of college with a business degree (a rarity) waits for the chance to get drafted but gets passed over because of a dismal senior season.  He had always been an excellent second baseman, leadoff singles hitter and base stealer, but now finds himself waiting by the phone.  His agent sends him to an obscure league in Iowa where things are not quite as they see.<br />Think - &quot;Shoeless Joe (or Field of Dreams)&quot; meets &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; only not as sinister.<br />The character Mike holds the story together.  His voice, motives and emotions are believable and while he's smart enough to know better he sometimes chooses the wrong path.  He holds to his dream.<br />I enjoyed Kinsella's writing.  The dialogue is great and there are many interesting stories within the story, like the Roger Cash episode where he bests the town's top team with only a group of high schoolers to back him up.  It's all about the distances.<br />Emmett Powell and his family were a hoot and there are a number of quirky characters in the mix.<br />My critiques:  A lot of telling and not enough showing.  There are scenes where someone is relating a story and I lose sense of where I am, especially when the storyteller basically drops out of the novel.  The imagery is vivid but I wanted more substance.<br />Going with the previous comment, I felt many of the characters were not fully developed.  We never really get to know Mike's brother, Byron.  Nor do we get much insight into Daniel Morganstern's issues with the team.  Stanley Wood disappears about halfway through, as does Crease.  McMartin has an episode then reappears later.<br />Would I recommend the book?  Yes, it's a pleasant summer read.	2002-04-10

An interesting character to what could build into a great series.<br />The plot at first seems simple, January must discover the true killer of Otis Redfern, but along the way he gets involved with slave kidnapping, slanderous accusations among so-called \\"medical professionals\\" and must carefully maneuver the caste hierarchy that existed in 1830's New Orleans.<br />Here are things I liked about the book:<br />The level of detail presented was excellent, from the character's skin tone, dress and physicality to the way they spoke.  The buildings and period description immerse the reader into that time.  The atmosphere of hot summer, fever and cholera is as much a character as the people.  In fact, once the summer was over and the plot remained unresolved I thought it took a little of the edge off the story.<br />I like that the characters, both black and white and in between, are depicted in shades of gray and shadows.  Not every white person is shown as a cruel slave owner or crude illiterate and not every person of color or black is shown as a noble victim of the oppressed.<br />These are complex characters with the illusion of reality.  January's best friend, Hannibal, is an Irish violin virtuoso who reads several languages and reels off quotes but is also a drunk, an opium addict infected with consumption and regular customer with prostitutes.<br />Abishag Shaw, January's associate with the law, is an unwashed, tobacco-spitting Kaintuck but who knows enough French to pronouce the names correctly and has a strong but unspoken moral and ethical code.<br />The story also introduces Rose Vitrac, an educated woman of color who runs a school for girls that want something more than to be a placee for a white man.  Rose is also a complex character, emotionally scarred, but provides a good ally for January.<br />There are many other interesting characters and again I enjoyed the way January moves through the various levels of this society.  The medical practice was truly horrifying.<br />My main critique is that January is always thinking about the caste system that exists there.  Always.  It sometimes detracted from the plot.  I also wanted to get deeper into his relationship with his mother.  Livia Levesque was one not given much dimension.<br />I also was a little disappointed with the historical epilogue and felt it was not needed.<br />My questions:  What happens next?
