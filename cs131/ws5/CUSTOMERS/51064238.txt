I had to purchase this book for my intoductory ECE class, and I ended up dropping the class unable to understand the concepts.  The examples provided were extemeley easy and basic, while the problems at the end of  each chapter were horrific and ecclectic bunches of components.  There was  no explanation of how to work them, and few answers to check your work by.  I have re-enrolled in the class under a different professor using a  different book, and currently earning an A.	1999-10-13

Tom Clancy writes even longer books in three months, and Wolfe is certainly a better writer than Clancy, but he doesn't show that HERE. I'm not feeling sorry for him financially, since Wolfe made millions  off A MAN IN FULL. But what a waste of talent, when he could have been  producing something great. F. Scott Fitzgerald said that the stuff he wrote  the fastest was the best stuff. Wolfe should have heeded this advice in  year 5, and started a different book. Oh, well, Wolfe can take comfort in  the fact that Edmund Morris spent 16 years on his Reagan book DUTCH, and  it's even bigger garbage than A MAN IN FULL. I hope Wolfe returns to  nonfiction, which is what he does best (witness his recent article in  FORBES).	1999-10-12

After reading some of the instructional texts on Photoshop after I bought this book, I found that as much as Ben Willmore claims that he did not want to write a &quot;Step by Step&quot; approach, the book is way too thin on  the inner workings of Photoshop 5 to be of any real value. There are better  texts out there that teach more of what's going on in the program.

The flow of this work is what one would expect to see in spoken material. Additionally, this work has been translated from Chinese to  English. As the author indicates in the preface, there was no intent to use  fancy or stylistic grammatical techniques but the goal was to convey some  rather sophisticated concepts in a direct, simple manner.<br />This book is a  collection of teachings which were formerly taught only in secret from  master to disciple in China from antiquity. We are quite fortunate to have  this material in written form in the West and it has been largely  underappreciated by occidental westerners.<br />If the western reader can wade  through the cultural idiosyncrasies, the reader will find a very rich array  of important concepts of inestimable value to the spiritual seeker. An  understanding of Chinese history and culture is helpful but not necessary.  You will find answers to questions such as<br />* What did the Buddha really  teach?<br />* What is the value in practicing only one cultivation method?<br />*  What do most qigong schools really teach?<br />* Why should one not heal other  people's diseases?<br />* What is the meaning of life?<br />* What is Truth?<br />*  What is the purpose of being human?<br />* What is the law of the  universe?<br />* Why should we cultivate?<br />* Can one eliminate karma? If so,  how?<br />* What is the ultimate criteria for determining morality and  ethics?<br />Many of us grew up being taught that we should be good people by  our parents, churches, teachers, etc., but we were never given a really  good reason as to why we should. A perusal of the newspaper or a casual  observation of people reveals that most people do not abide by the  standards of moral conduct and behavior that we were raised on.<br />When you  read Zhuan Falun, you begin to understand why we should conform to the  highest moral and ethical standards. As such, it represents a very  significant contribution to the social ethic and personal evolution of each  reader.<br />The knowledge contained therein is of an extremely deep and  subtle nature. Each person will derive a different conceptual understanding  of the book and this understanding will evolve upon subsequent re-readings.  This is truly a book that grows on you and is unlike any other book in this  regard.<br />If you are a true spiritual seeker, this may be the last book you  will ever read on spirituality and metaphysics. Nothing else even comes  remotely close. And, best of all, you will achieve what you came here for.such, it represents a very  significant contribution to the social ethic and personal evolution of each  reader.<br />The knowledge contained therein is of an extremely deep and  subtle nature.

For  example, the authors recommend taking the mineral chromium, which I have  been taking for years to the improvement of my disease.  They also  recommend taking an herb, HCA, because it increases insulin sensitivity  like chromium does.  I am anxious to take it and see the kind of  improvement it leads to.Overall, this is an informative book that shows the  reader how to take control of his or her disease.	1999-01-11

This is the first Redwall book where the main character isn't the wielder of Martin's sword. The warriormaid Mariel's weapon of choice is a knotted piece of rope named 'Gullwhacker'. (Suprisingly, this is a very effective weapon.) She's stubborn, smart, brave, and out for revenge! Along with a small band of friends from Redwall Abbey, she is searching for Gabool the Wild. He's responsible for trying to murder her during a storm at sea. Mariel has sworn to kill the evil rat, but he is the King of the Searats with hordes of bloodthirsty killers at his command. The odds are not in the Woodlander's favor, but Mariel is a Warrior. One way or another, Gabool's days are numbered!        If you have the slightest interest in Redwall, this is one of the first ones you should read. It's descriptives are so real, you can almost taste the food, and you can nearly hear the ring of blade against blade during the battles.	1998-04-05

For instance, when Skipper of Otters fought with that eel. Or the part with the two bumbling vermin, Sneezewort and Lousewort. (Who names these guys?)  All they seemed to do was make the story longer. I wish it was explained why Lady Cregga Rose Eyes hates the Rapscallions so much. But I still LOVED the book. The hares live up to their reputations as perilous (and hilarious!), and all the woodlanders prove to be courageous warriors as once again Redwall Abbey is threatened by a warlord and his (not very bright) horde of vermin, who never seem to learn not to mess with Redwall. I can't wait for the next one, but I have one question: Why is the battle cry of the hares and badgers &quot;Eulalia!&quot;?	1998-03-26

At first, the main character, Mattimeo, is a BRAT! As the son of Redwall's champion, Matthias, he's allowed to get away with pretty much anything. Until a revenge-driven foe from Redwall's past, Slagar the Cruel, pays a visit to the Abbey. By the dark of night, Mattimeo and several of his friends are stolen away by the masked fox. In the morning rain,  Matthias swears by his sword to  bring them back, and the perilous chase begins. It is a quest full of revenge, puzzles, adventures, battles, heartbreak, reunion, new friends and old. And Mattimeo joins the ranks of Redwall Abbey's legendary warriors	1998-02-28

'The Outcast of Redwall' was a pretty good book, but it definetely didn't live up to 'Redwall'. The beginning was promising, but the middle was lacking in the usual quests and adventures.
