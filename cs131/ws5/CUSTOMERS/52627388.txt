Well, when you put it that way, fasting sounds downright elegant, doesn't it? After reading this book, you'll see that there's a whole lot more to it than just, well, starving yourself. Fasting is a gift you give yourself, and it can be spiritually and physically transforming. This book, in true Jeremy Safron style, covers the topic succinctly and beautifully, including absolutely everything you need to know to prepare for and perform a fast in 88 pages (another good stocking stuffer at about 6x8\\"!).  <br /> <br />One of my favorite parts of the book is the Self-Empowerment Questionnaire at the end \\"designed to track and guage the process of healing,\\" because that's really what fasting is all about - cleaning out the body and quieting the mind. This book covers every kind of fast you can imagine, from speech fasts (no talking) to sweet food fasts as well as traditional juice and water fasts. You'll learn about cleansing practices for all different organs and fasting assistants like pranayama, yoga, sweats, skin brushing, writing, castor packs - the list is too long for this review.  <br /> <br />Suffice it to say that this book is all you need to get started on this time-honored cleansing ritual. As soon as I finish writing this review, I'm filling out the questionnaire and sending it in by email for advise on the type of fasting program and other practices that are right for me. And of course, I'll check with my doctor before getting started. Treat yourself: get this book - a true gift - and do the same for your health and well-being.--Melanie Wilson <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-01

I just love this little book, and I wish I'd had it when I first started working toward a raw diet. Don't let it's little size fool you (about 6x8\\" - perfect stocking stuffer!). It's one of the most useful books on raw foods that I've ever read, despite it's having only 90 pages. Jeremy Saffron, author of The Fasting Handbook: Dining from an Empty Bowl, has mastered the art of saying a lot by saying very little. He chooses his topics with care and covers them succinctly and completely.  <br /> <br />Let me tell you what you'll get out of this book besides a complete list of raw restaurants and food sources. He answers all the questions that I and many others asked as raw food newbies (and frankly were still wondering about), like \\"Is nutritional yeast really raw?\\" and \\"If you could give me a list of the top five foods to include in my diet, what would they be?\\" I especially liked his sections on travel, dehydrating, foraging, and culturing, and extras like Easy Indoor Gardening and Types of Raw Food Diets (Hydrorians? Who knew?).  <br /> <br />This is THE perfect gift for someone considering adopting a raw food diet. <br />	2005-10-01

The first thing you need to know about Heather Houck Reseck, the author of this book, is that she's a member of the Seventh Day Adventist church. Not that it matters what religion your cookbook author is, but I didn't know this when I started reading this guidebook and I was distracted by her talk about the Sabbath and going to church until I realized what church she was talking about.  <br /> <br />She's also a registered dietician and health consultant dedicated to helping hurried families eat healthy meals. Her book is big on shortcuts, from mixes to slow cooking, marathon cooking sessions to buying in bulk.  <br /> <br />The book includes more than 100 pages on meal planning, nutrition and quick cooking methods, while the rest of the book features recipes for mixes, breads, dishes with fruit, entrees, side dishes, bean dishes, salads and food gifts.  <br /> <br />All of the recipes include many variations so you can get a lot of mileage out of this book just by trying the same recipe in a different way. For instance, the recipe for bean enchiladas is a delicious but pretty standard bean, cheese and sauce situation that initially calls for refried beans, but includes variations that add brown rice, meatless burger, green chilies, sauted vegetables and extra spice or exchanging the refried beans for black beans (which is the way I tried it, and I would definitely do it again).  <br /> <br />Many of the recipes also include variations on how to cook the meal, from using the microwave, oven or stovetop to plugging in the slow cooker. There are tons of hints, tips and techniques for cooking quick, healthy meals that your family will love. If you want to know how to use a slow cooker or a pressure cooker, freeze meals for your family or get in and out of the supermarket faster, you'll find something of use in this book.  <br /> <br />This book provides a very solid education in planning and eating vegetarian meals. Reseck is a little obsessed with clever plays on words and acronyms, but mostly these puns just serve to highlight her enthusiasm in her topic.  <br /> <br />Reseck says there are eight traits of great cooks: they plan proactively, prepare nutritious food, produce delicious food, preserve simplicity, prize beauty, pursue timesaving strategies, practice ingenuity and persevere at learning. With the help of this book, you will build up a bunch of these traits, becoming a better good and giving your family more nutritious food in a flash. --Sarah E. White <br /> <br />	2005-10-01

Anyone who has ever picked up a juice book will adore this one!  <br /> <br />But Juice Power for the thirsty soul is not just a juice book; it is jam packed with lively smoothie and shake recipes as well. All of the recipes are easy to make and could easily accomodate a raw foodist by substituting nuts and seeds to replace the soy. We tried all of the recipes in the book and our favorite ones are Ginger Get Well, Tropical Dream, and the Daily Grape Drink. For the sugar aspect of the recipes (maple syrup, honey, etc.) we substituted wild raw agave nectar. Juice Power for the thirsty soul is a real gem. My son Ian and I highly recommend this book. --Angela Elliot <br />	2005-08-15

Raw chef to the stars Bryan Au has written a new cookbook, Raw in Ten Minutes. In it, he's designed recipes that will appeal to the whole family, from the \\"Raweo Cookie\\" to \\"Grilled Cheese.\\" <br /> <br />The concept of this book is so appealing. I love raw cuisine - when someone else prepares it! All the great raw meals I've had have taken hours, sometimes days of preparation for all the soaking and sprouting and dehydrating that goes into them. I was very excited to see a book that gives recipes for preparing raw cuisine - fast. The recipes sound great, but the author does make a lot of assumptions about what the reader already knows how to do. For example, in a recipe for Curried Humus, it calls for \\"2 cups soaked chickpeas,\\" I'd like to know, how long do I soak them (there is a sentence or two about soaking in the introduction), and what amount of dry chickpeas makes two cups soaked? <br /> <br />Not surprisingly, the raw recipes call for some unusual ingredients that may have to be mail-ordered (Azuki-bean miso, for instance). Also, many of the tools required may not be in a conventional kitchen, like a mandolin slicer and a professional blender. <br /> <br />The color pictures on the front and back cover look delicious. The \\"mashed potatoes & gravy\\" and the \\"nuggets with BBQ sauce\\" are two of the must-make recipes in the book. Although it is missing two features high on my list for good cookbooks: an index and nutritional information for the recipes, Raw in 10 Minutes does have a useful resources section with books and web sites to help people with raw cooking. Because the recipes seem accessible and tasty, it's a good introduction to vegetarians interested in branching out to raw cuisine.--Amy O'Neill Houck	2005-08-12

The subtitle (\\"Creative Gardening for the Adventurous Cook\\"), encapsulates quite nicely why this is a cookbook far beyond the norm. Written specifically to help in growing vegetables so that we can cook with them, each flower, herb or vegetable is accompanied by tips for its best use in the kitchen. <br />  <br />Published originally in 1992, the 2004 update includes more information, resources and recipes. The text is simple yet thorough, and is chock-full of tips, ideas, illustrations and charming anecdotes. In simple, straightforward text, Hirsch gives instructions for growing, harvesting, and cooking with over 75 vegetables and herbs. <br />  <br />The cookbook is accessible for beginners, while being complex and satisfying enough for more experienced gardeners. Chapters are devoted to gardening techniques, crop rotation, seed starting, and natural ways to defend against insects. Another chapter covers various kinds of gardens, from hillside, to walled patio, to container gardening, while the 70+ recipes will showcase the fruits of your labor and help transform them to the the pleasures of the table.  <br />  <br />The recipes are delicious and comprehensive, from soups, dips and salads to appetizers and main dishes. Hirsch also includes information on cooking times and techniques, as well as the effective use of herbs (with advice for planting, compatibility and cooking). It is hard to pick favorites, but the Vegetable \\"Pasta\\", Summer Rolls, and Portuguese Kale Soup are among my favorites so far. <br />  <br />The recipes are not all vegan (although of course they are vegetarian), but vegan options can be substituted (soy cheese for non-soy, etc). A must have cookbook for gardeners and cooks alike.--By Lisa Steele	2005-08-12

Over the years of failing to keep even the most hardy houseplants alive, I've figured out why with my husband's help. He is an avid gardener, green thumb extraordinaire. It's not that much of a mystery, really, why his plants thrive and mine dry up and shrink to nothing. It's just that plants and gardens take work, plain and simple. I've just been too lazy because gardening doesn't excite me. <br /> <br />Well, I think I may have found a way to keep myself in the garden! Not long ago I was reading a children's magazine which talked about planting a completely purple garden, and I thought, yeah, that's the ticket! How fun! Well, this book is the grown-up version of that idea. The pen-and-ink and watercolor illustrations are gorgeous, and each of the 75 physically beautiful vegetables featured includes a couple pages detailing its interesting history, nutritional content, and growing instructions. What a way to make gardening fun! <br /> <br />This book isn't just for amateurish types like myself looking for external incentives to get out into the garden. My husband, an experienced gardener, learned a few things, too. How do these unique vegetables sound? Artichoke \\"Violetto de Romagna,\\" Dwarf Blue Curled Scotch Kale, Giant Red Celery, Purple Calabash Tomato, Sunburst Squash, and Zebra Hybrid Eggplant, just to name a few!

Two books that my son Liam and I enjoyed recently are Little Mouse, I Love You and Good Night, Little Mouse. Written by Dugald Steer, illustrated by Caroline Anstey and published by Scholastic Canada Ltd., these stories deal with the subjects of love and noises in the night.  <br /> <br />In Good Night Little Mouse, Little Mouse's Grandpa comforts her at bedtime by showing her those who were responsible for making the various noises that she hears. By showing Little Mouse an owl, a fox, an otter and some badgers who are going about their night time activities, Grandpa helps Little Mouse to overcome her fears.  <br /> <br />Little Mouse, I Love You sees Little Mouse's \\"Gran\\" answering her granddaughter's question \\"What is love?\\" Gran answers the question by taking Little Mouse on a walk and showing her various animals who are caring for their young. Gran shows Little Mouse a mother wren teaching her chicks to fly, a mother squirrel sharing acorns with her children, a mother rabbit care for her injured child and a mother sheep who comforts her frightened lamb. All of these compassionate acts are displays of love. When evening comes Gran and Little Mouse return home where Little Mouse reflects on what she saw that day before going to bed.  <br /> <br />Children will enjoy the subtle lessons of these stories which features nature and animals.

Besides numerous nutritious recipes for breakfast and brunch, baked goods, sauces, spreads, soups, main courses and other things, Burton provides advice for \\"Feeding Your Vegan Baby & Toddler\\" which is divided into age groups for 6-9 months, 9-12 months, 12-18 months, 18-24 months and 2+ years. In the section \\"Additional Notes for Feeding Baby\\" Burton discusses organic foods, prepackaged foods vs. home-made and food preparation tips.  <br /> <br />Another helpful section that offers practical information is \\"Cooking Guides & Notes\\" where the author provides guides to cooking grains and beans and other \\"Cooking Notes.\\" A comprehensive glossary is also useful.  <br /> <br />Burton's support of hemp foods is a welcome addition to this recipe book and will hopefully encourage other cookbook authors to feature this nutritious food in their books. Not only does Burton include a section on \\"Hemp Foods,\\" but she also mentions the importance of hemp in the Introduction.  <br /> <br />\\"This is one of the few cookbooks you will see that features hemp products. Hemp seed nuts and nut butter provide complete protein and essential fatty acids that we can only get from our diet. Hemp seed oil is also rich in the essential fatty acids.\\" (page 14)  <br /> <br />Another interesting aspect of Burton's book involves the relatively small number of recipes that contain soy. Burton's reason for minimizing her use of soy is simple. \\"I suspect that many vegetarians and vegans rely a little too heavily on soy, and while I still include it in my family's diet, no one food should be consumed excessively.\\" (page 14) Burton also includes numerous wheat-free recipes and recipes which feature a wheat-free option.  <br /> <br />It's nice to see that vegan recipe books are becoming more popular. Vive le Vegan! is one of the better vegan cookbooks that I've seen as it not only offers a good selection of easy-to-make, nutritious meals and snacks, but itcontains lots of other important information as well. Those who turned to vegetarianism due to a love of and respect for animals will want to get a copy of Burton's book and consider taking the next step to veganism. As Eric Marcus points out in the Foreword:  <br /> <br />\\"Many people assume that concerns over cruelty can be addressed by becoming a lacto-ovo vegetarian, and buying free-range eggs and organic milk. Unfortunately, welfare standards for these foods are utterly lacking. And, just as troubling, these foods depend on slaughter every bit as much as their factory farmed counterparts. There is simply no such thing as animal agriculture without suffering and killing - the economics just don't allow it.\\"  <br /> <br />Vive le Vegan! will be of interest to everyone looking for interesting, nutritious, cruelty-free recipes.--N.

They include nice preparation tips and well-written instructions as well as useful nutritional information. There is also a good index (which many cookbooks often lack), and it includes beautiful color photos of some of the recipes.

The section on sauces, includes recipes that could easily become household favorites - like \\"Miso Good Gravy!\\" and \\"Amazing Creamy Caesar Dressing.\\" There's a great section on Salads and Sandwiches which offers quick and easy meal ideas including a delicious way to use up leftover fried or marinated tofu in a sandwich filling. --Amy O'Neill Houck <br />	2005-02-19

This book is part of a new series of vegetarian guides to major cities. The pocket or purse-sized guide is packed full of reviews and information about restaurants around New York-Manhattan and the five boroughs. The guide is organized by neighborhood, and includes a nice map of all the locations listed in the book. Within the neighborhood section, the locations are listed alphabetically, but there is an index by cuisine at the back of the book.  <br /> <br />Each Restaurant is rated for quality and price and has a key to whether the location is vegetarian, vegan, or a conventional menu with vegetarian choices. There's a short description for each restaurant which provides useful information about the location, sometimes describing favorite dishes. Because the book was written by one person, Justin Schwartz, who reviewed all the restaurants himself (!), it is useful to read the introduction to get a feel for his style and what he likes and doesn't like. (For instance, he loves falafel, so there are endless choices of great places to find it all over the city).  <br /> <br />There are many fantastic restaurants listed in Veg Out that I wouldn't have heard of otherwise, but the author also spends a lot of time describing one or no-star restaurants, when I think he simply could have listed the location with a caveat to stay away. The size, convenience and well-stocked pages of this guide make it a great book to carry on your next trip to the city. --Amy O'Neill Houck <br />	2005-02-18

It can become frustrating when you find a great sounding recipe only to see that several items, which would be difficult to substitute, are from animals.  <br /> <br />Vegetarians considering switching to veganism will want a copy of Foods That Don't Bite Back: Vegan Foods Made Simple as the author, Sue Donaldson, has included important information in the section entitled \\"Why Become a Vegan?\\" where she looks at numerous reasons why this healthy, compassionate diet should be embraced. In the preface, Donaldson describes the cruel conditions that nonhuman animals enslaved for their flesh, milk and eggs are forced to endure before they are killed. She also provides many arguments as to why a compassionate, vegan diet is preferable for human and nonhuman animals as well as the environment and how it can be attained.  <br /> <br />\\"If you are concerned about the environment, there are a number of dietary steps you can take to demonstrate your concern. The single most important step is to become a vegan. Only by drastically limiting our dependence on animal-based foods can we develop a sustainable relationship with the environment. Another key step is to buy organic produce whenever possible, thus encouraging the agricultural industry to lessen its dependency on chemicals. A further benefit of going organic is that you thereby support what are typically small, family-run farms over agribusiness. Large-scale and intensive farming is responsible for most environmental degradation.\\" (page 21)  <br /> <br />Donaldson also provides suggestions and tips pertaining to \\"raising vegan kids in a non-vegan world\\" including some of the books and websites listed in the \\"Resources for Further Reading.\\" She also covers \\"Hidden Animal Ingredients\\" as well as where to go online for more information on this important subject. A short section on \\"VeganSubstitutions for Cooking and Baking\\" is also helpful.  <br /> <br />Donaldson's recipes are varied and are divided into sections on: starters, soups, side dishes, main dishes and desserts. Many of the recipes are easy to make and Donaldson provides variations for several of them.  <br /> <br />The glossary of ingredients is informative and provides the reader with definitions for many vegan foods and ingredients. This section will be particularly helpful to those who have recently made the transition to this healthy, kind and environmentally friendly diet. There is even a section on \\"Vegan Pets.\\"  <br /> <br />Whether you are looking for good vegan recipes, reasons why a vegan diet is important or more information pertaining to hidden animal ingredients in foods, Foods That Don't Bite Back is definitely worth a read.  <br /> <br />	2005-02-09

The Respiratory Solution contains considerable information on dealing with respiratory ailments using natural medicines. Written by Dr. Cass Ingram, a physician and author, this book provides lots of advice for staying healthy in a world that is largely polluted.  <br /> <br />\\"There are hundreds of pollutants in city air. The majority of these pollutants arise from vehicular exhaust. Industrial exhaust fouls the air with a host of toxins, including mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium, beryllium, sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, dioxins, toxic hydrocarbons, and thousands of others. Jet exhaust is an enormous contributor to air pollution. In cities with international airports the air may be so polluted as to be deemed virtually cancerous.\\" (pages 25, 26)  <br /> <br />While most people are aware that pollution affects health, they may not be aware of some simple things that can be done to improve health. Dr. Ingram covers subjects such as the importance of deep breathing, sleeping positions and minimizing exposure to chemical pollutants and basement air. Dr. Ingram states that \\"...relaxed deep breathing is such a powerful technique that it may by itself result in an immediate improvement in health.\\" (pages 16, 17) Dr. Ingram also says that it is dangerous to breathe through the mouth and that stomach sleeping is the most dangerous position in which to sleep.  <br /> <br />After providing practical information dealing with breathing, sleeping, pollution, germs, mold, food allergies and the power of spice extracts, Dr. Ingram spends much of the book writing about \\"Respiratory Illnesses and Their Natural Cures\\" - everything from actinomycosis to whooping cough and including ailments such as asthma, bronchitis, colds, emphysema, flu, hay fever, pneumonia, sinusitis and smoke inhalation. For each condition Dr. Ingram describes the respiratory ailment, symptoms, causes as well as \\"treatment protocol.\\"  <br /> <br />A short chapter on \\"Staying Healthy\\" looks atsuch topics as exercise, improved posture, breathing, proper ventilation and drug toxicity. In the last chapter, Dr. Ingram describes the importance of natural cures for respiratory illnesses.  <br /> <br />\\"Proper diet, nutritional supplements, herbal medicines, and detoxification programs directly improve respiratory health. Thus, only through natural, non-toxic methods can the respiratory system be healed. If no effort is made, the toxins accumulate, causing damage as well as disease. Vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, herbal extracts, spice extracts, and medicinal foods, like honey and vinegar, are powerful tools for regenerating the lungs and keeping them as healthy as possible. In other words, only natural cures are capable of reversing lung diseases. Plus, natural cures are safe, that is they will not destroy lung or respiratory tissues. Nor will they cause annoying side effects, which plague drug users.\\" (pages 187, 188)  <br /> <br />Anyone who wants to protect themselves and their family from respiratory ailments and who want to know ways of treating respiratory problems that may arise will want to read The Respiratory Solution. --N.

YoChee, or yogurt cheese, is a concentrated form of yogurt used in cooking and baking that you can make at home with the right yogurt and some very simple steps. Eat Well The YoChee Way: Guide and 275 Recipes guides the reader through making YoChee and gives a variety of ways you can use the thickened, creamy substance to replace more fatty, creamy ingredients in recipes such as spreads, breads, casseroles, pastas, desserts and breakfast recipes.  <br /> <br />I am a yogurt fanatic, just ask my college roommates. It was the joke in our apartment that we could always count on one thing in the fridge (and surprisingly for college students it wasn't beer) -- Dana's yogurt. So I was excited to try making YoChee. Yogurt has numerous health properties associated with it, including live and active yogurt cultures that promote healthy digestion and the body's yeast fighting powers, high amounts of calcium and a vegetarian source of high-quality protein with much less fat than found in other dairy products such as cheeses.  <br /> <br />I was surprised to read that YoChee (in a variety of other names) has been used in Middle Eastern cooking for generations. This gave me confidence that, if it's been made for generations, it must be easy enough to prepare. But the instructions page seems a bit more complicated than the actual process of making YoChee turned out to be. And a mention of the \\"specially designed draining device\\" that the reader can buy from the YoChee.com website made me wonder if I could make this at home without buying the recommended equipment.  <br /> <br />Turns out, making YoChee was quite simple. It's as easy as buying a yogurt without any thickening agents, stabilizers, gelatin or gums in it (Dannon Plain contains milk only and is relatively inexpensive), then setting a cone wire coffee filter on top of a jar, filling it with Yogurt and allowing the watery substance leak out of the yogurt for a number of hours (mine sat for about six to eight hours). Youcan also use a colander and cheesecloth set over a bowl, although I can imagine scraping the YoChee out of the cheesecloth may be messy. The end results looks like a whole-milk sour cream or a cream cheese.  <br /> <br />I used the YoChee to make sweet biscuits, which were very good. The YoChee took the place of a shortening or butter ingredient. With 7 grams of protein per biscuit, 150 mg of calcium and less than one gram of saturated fat, this recipe trumps any traditional biscuit recipe in health properties and tastes just as flavorful and heartier than the average biscuit.  <br /> <br />Other recipes I'd like to try with my next batch of YoChee include a Quick Creamy Bean Stew, Eggplant and Potato Curry, Superior Spinach Dip, YoChee Pesto and a frozen dessert snack \\"cube\\" called Cocoa Chunks that the book says you can store in the freezer and \\"pop in your mouth when the mood hits.\\"  <br /> <br />Almost any recipe that uses butter, cream cheese, sour cream or mayonnaise appears to be able use YoChee as a healthy substitute to these high fat ingredients. I recommend trying YoChee and reading this book to yogurt lovers, dairy consuming vegetarians, people with lactose intolerance or anyone who wants to lower their fat intake while increasing their intake of calcium, protein and live active yogurt cultures.  <br /> <br />The book says you can use cow, goat, sheep or soy yogurt. However, all the recipes in the book were tested with only cow's milk. In my own yogurt quest over the years, I've tried soy yogurt and not liked it because it felt too \\"gummy\\" to me, but that could be because I tried a brand with gums or thickeners in it, which is a no-no for making YoChee. Perhaps there's a soy yogurt brand out there without any of those additives in it, and then it would work fine. --D.Anderson-Villamagna <br /> <br />	2005-02-09

It is a wonderful book for helping people not only transition from the Standard American Diet of meat and dairy to veganism, but also learning to integrate raw foods into their new lifestyle.  If you are looking for a 100 percent raw food book, this is not for you. This book is not about dieting and recipes, it's about helping you build a stronger and happier life. Filled with Julie's inspirational stories, over 100 transitional recipes, and her tips for getting your life back on track. Everyone's journey is different, but we all have one thing in common, we each have to take the steps to reach our goals. Her realism is what got me to keep turning the pages. She has a great sense of humor about often embarrassing moments. We've all been there! I love reading stories of great courage and this is one of those. Julie Wandling weighed 315 pounds, had high blood pressure, back pain and could barely walk up a flight of stairs. Through the help of her mother, she found the vegan diet and raw foods and that was the start of her new life. Now at age 40, she is able to run, jump, hike, dance, swim, twirl a baton, and play with her children. In her book, she asks her readers questions like, Are you sick of being sick and tired? Overweight? Fatigued? In Pain? Then happily says, \\"I was all of these 15 months ago!\\"	2005-01-31

I was very impressed with the overall layout of the book. The forward by Nicholas J. Gonzalez, M.D. was fantastic. His description of the raw food lifestyle is very well researched and beautifully presented. This alone makes me delighted to have the book.  <br /> <br />I tried four of the recipes, and they were all good. My favorite two were Kelly's Macadamia Whipped Cream and Kelly's Lemon Custard. I was impressed by how Carol believes in and defends the raw food lifestyle. I also liked her honesty about her popcorn slip ups. I love how down-to-earth she is. I also loved how she pointed out in her book that the raw food lifestyle is not a fad.  <br /> <br />The first raw food restaurant opened in 1917 and stayed open until World War II. There are books on raw foods that date back to 1925, and I'm sure if I did even more research I would find books dating back even further. As Carol puts it in reference to the books and restaurant, \\"That's too long ago for this to be a fad.\\" I think Carol is wonderful for the raw food movement. People admire her and respect her, so it can only help push the raw movement mainstream.  <br /> <br />My concern with book is that she mentions eating raw meat and raw dairy. I agree that we are all different, but I have not seen any value or benefit from adding raw animal products to one's diet. I have seen fabulous results with the raw vegan lifestyle mixed with exercise. I culture all my foods and feel that this is vital to our health. Perhaps this is why Carol adds raw dairy to her diet. It is quite simple to culture seeds, nuts, and coconuts and reap amazing health benefits from this.  <br /> <br />There are a few drawbacks to this book. The recipe section is very small and surprisingly, none of the recipes are hers. There are many conflicting references in regard to eating animal products. Carol seems to spend a good deal of time defending that decision which ends up confusing the reader on whether one should or shouldn't eat raw animal products. The pro arguments aren't convincing enough. I would have liked to have seen solid up to date research. Although, I loved a lot of what was in Carol's book, I would not recommend that someone who is new to the raw food lifestyle purchase her book. It is too confusing. This is an excellent book for the experienced raw foodist.--Angela Elliot <br />	2005-01-15

Anyone who has had the supreme pleasure of dining at Roxanne's Raw, knows why I was so excited to receive this gorgeous coffee table book in the mail. Of course, you won't want to keep it in the living room all the time, because you'll need it in the kitchen to create Charlie Trotter and Roxanne Klein's delicious gourmet cuisine.  <br /> <br />A warning: this book is not for the faint of heart. But let me say that even if you never take the time to make one of these fabulous creations, you'll find yourself dreamily flipping through the pages over a cup of herbal tea and wishing for your own personal raw chef. I love to leave this book out for two reasons: one, it inspires and challenges me when I'm feeling bored with my food, and two, it so beautifully answers the question \\"So what do you eat - salads?\\"  <br /> <br />Each 2-page spread is devoted to one glorious recipe and a full-page color photograph of the finished product. Believe me when I say that every single second of time and energy that goes into one of these recipes will be rewarded with a wonderfully worthy raw meal. The section on \\"pairing wine and raw food\\" is accentuated by Wine Notes with each recipe.  <br /> <br />I'm very sad that I will never set foot in Roxanne's restaurant again since the place had to close down in 2004, so I will hold on to this book and keep it as a treasured part of my recipe book collection. Each time I open it, I know that I hold in my hands a part of raw food history and the key to recreating the singular experience that it was to dine at her establishment.  <br />But let's not forget Charlie Trotter, six-time James Beard Award-winner and one of the top chefs of our time. He met Roxanne and her husband through his restaurant in Chicago and challenged him by requesting raw meals. His introduction to the book alone will provide you with a number of valuable tips to raw food preparation and a view into how one traditional chef exanded his horizons. Roxanne herself was led downthe path to raw foods when she met up with actor and raw foodist Woody Harrelson in Thailand while researching cuisine for a vegan cookbook. <br /> <br />In her words: \\"My raw cuisine is about discovering the inherent sensuality of each ingredient in its natural state, and then highlighting it in the final dish.\\" This food is indeed sensuous, and, in your hands, this book could be the one to awaken your own desire to create awe-inspiring dishes. <br /> <br />	2005-01-15

This fantastic collection of over 350 recipes by 49 of the world's most reknowned raw chefs will have any uncooked enthusiast flipping madly through the pages looking for their favorite names. You'll find recipes from Stephen Arlin, The Boutenko Family, Juliano, Dave Klein, Viktoras Kulvinskas, Paul Nison, Rhio, Chad Sarno, Nomi Shannon, Shazzie, Cherie Soria, Jinjee & Storm Taliafero, David Wolfe, and many more. The book also includes recipes from the Quintessence raw restaurant.  <br /> <br />For the few names you might not recognize, you can flip to the \\"Meet Our Chefs\\" section in the back for a short bio on each one. You'll also find sections on \\"The Right Ingredients,\\" \\"Essential Tools,\\" \\"Juicers & Juicing,\\" \\"Sprouting and Greening,\\" \\"Dehydrating,\\" and \\"Advice From the Pros,\\" as well as a helpful glossary of ingredients, suggested readings, and an extensive list of resources.  <br /> <br />The recipe section of the book contains everything from specialty dishes to create a gourmet, 5-course dinner to recipes for simple soups or salads. There are a few full-color photos interspersed throughout. My only complaint is that I wish there were more - but I'm sure they would have raised the price of the book. Each recipe lists serving size information and special equipment needed and often include variations and/or contributors' notes.  <br /> <br />I disagree with other reviewers who've said the recipes all require too much time; that simply isn't true. I randomly flipped to five different pages, and each had at least one recipe that would take 10 minutes or less to prepare. Certainly, some do require dehydrating, but in my experience, once you get the recipe together quickly, you can leave it to dehydrate and forget about it till it's done; the time it takes is really deceptive. <br /> <br />What makes this book truly different from most of the other raw recipe books out there is that this one was written to appeal to raw foodists, vegetarians, and cooked omnivores alike! Beyond the 2-page \\"Why Raw?\\" introduction, there's no overt promotion of the lifestyle. The book aims to reach everyone and encourage them all to eat more healthful raw foods by providing a huge selection of mouthwatering recipes. \\"Do you have to be a vegan to eat raw food? Of course not! Many people who consider themselves 'raw fooders' eat a diet comprised of 50 to 100 percent raw food. [This book] is for anyone who wants to eat more fruits and vegetables and prepare them in exciting new ways.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-15

Baby Greens is a delightful and informative book on adding raw foods into the diet of children. In the introduction, author Michaela Lynn describes her search for answers about raw foods first for herself and later for babies and kids. She mentions her frustration at not finding a book on those topics. She finally comes to realize that she is supposed to write that book! Lynn makes it clear that Baby Greens is not meant to promote a rigid diet but rather to help families of all dietary persuasions add more living foods to their repertoire.  <br /> <br />Part one of Baby Greens is a collection of essays on health and bioenergetic nutrition written by Michael Chrisemer, N.C. Chrisemer's essays are readable and educational. He covers a variety of topics ranging from enzymes, toxins, sea vegetables, vitamins, and water to breastfeeding. Each essay is short and to the point. They are packed with information that will inspire the reader to explore each topic more in-depth. I was fascinated to learn about the homeopathic qualities of sea vegetables. I was likewise pleased to read that Chrisemer makes correlations between breastfeeding behavior and later eating habits. His bits of wisdom make perfect sense to me. In his essay \\"Putting it All Together,\\" Chrisemer discusses children and their need for autonomy. He shares an anecdote about a pudding pie he craved after seeing a TV commercial. Instead of denying him the experience of the pie, his mother bought it for him. He found the pie to be much different from his expectations and he never asked for another. Had his mother denied him that experience, he might have missed out on an important opportunity for growth.  <br /> <br />Part two of Baby Greens is all about food recipes and activities. This is where the book really shines. Each page is filled with whimsical drawings, helpful hints and great recipes. Lynn covers everything from pregnancy nutrition to feeding a baby old who is enough for solids to getting your bigger kid to help prepare the meal. I decided to truly put this book to the test. I would need to prepare and consume (with my kids of course!) as many of the meals as possible. We started out by making Cupid's Soup from page 72. This is a delicious mixture of beets and apples that my children both happily gobbled up. The next recipe we tried was from page 92, the carrot-raisin salad. This is a twist on the traditional made with mayonnaise. The flavor of this new carrot raisin salad is fantastic! I made it for a playgroup, and it was very well received by everyone. Since I've had the book, I've made about a half dozen of the recipes and have been very pleased with all of them. I also found the games and resources in the back of the book to be especially fun and helpful. I even located a source for organic avocados right down the road from me.  <br /> <br />Baby Greens is such a lovely book and should be in the library of every new parent. The authors are never judgmental. They offer gentle suggestions for improving on current diets rather than advocating for a raw-only lifestyle. You can hear the respect and love in the tone of the writing. I find the compassionate language used throughout the pages to be very soothing. This book is such a pleasure to read and I cannot recommend it enough. --Mona Harris <br />	2004-12-29

I met Robyn Boyd at the International Festival of Raw Foods in Portland, OR last summer (2004) and was impressed by her immediately. She gave me a copy of her book to review and stressed her daughter's help in assisting to develop the recipes. That caught me right there! Any cookbook author whose child has a major say in the recipe tasting and selection gets points in my book. You may wonder why I didn't say \\"un-cookbook\\" or \\"recipe book\\" ... that's because Boyd advocates eating \\"simply, purely, wholly, and 75-80% raw.\\" Whether or not you're into raw foods doesn't matter; this book is for all families wanting to transition to a healthier eating. That's why she calls it RawSome Recipes - 75 percent are raw recipes, while 93 percent are vegan.   <br /> <br />First, her recipes are fabulous! My family and I tried many of them, some cooked, some not, and they were all easy to prepare and delicious. The ones especially endorsed by Boyd's daughter Molly and her friends aged 4-14 are marked \\"RawSome Kid Recipe!\\" There is also lots of information for families in this book. She includes sections called \\"RawSome Kids,\\" \\"Great After-School Snacks and Grazing Food for Play Dates,\\" \\"Tips for Healthy Traveling,\\" and \\"What to Pack in the School Lunch Box.\\" For entertaining I was happy to see \\"Fit for Company...Four All-Raw Dinner Menus\\" and a \\"RawSome Holiday Menu,\\" from which I will plan my Thanksgiving and Christmas menus.  <br /> <br />Another thing I really like about this book is that it is full of beautiful color photos, a selection of which you can see here. And some of the more complicated recipes (not that any of them are truly complicated) include not only a photo of the finished product but pictures of steps along the way. In addition, Boyd includes a wealth of information on various aspects of a healthy lifestyle, including some basic nutrition information, for example, the value of sea vegetables and a list of recommended whole food supplements, like barley grass andspirulina.  <br /> <br />While most of her recipes include readily recognizable food items, for those of you wondering just what the heck kombu is exactly, or why some of her recipes call for coconut oil, you can flip to the glossary in the back. This list of resources for buying many of these items, if you can't find them in your local health food store or Whole Foods, will also come in handy. In this book I found the answer to integrating my family's cooked vegan diet and my raw vegan diet. It's absolutely the best one I've come across for those desiring to incorporate more raw and vegan foods into their families' diets but aren't sure about going all vegan or all raw - or just plain don't want to.   <br /> <br />Boyd writes from a Christian perspective, but you mustn't think her book is exclusively for Christians. While she includes interesting and thought-provoking sections entitled \\"Whole Foods the Way God Intended\\" and \\"Eating Vegetables Worked for Daniel\\" (Daniel 1:3-20, a story which is great to share with children!), there is an abundance of nutritional information and resources that anyone will appreciate. I very highly recommend this book!  <br /> <br />	2004-12-28

One morning, during the second week into second grade, my son announced that he was through with sandwiches and would prefer something else be packed in his lunchbox instead.  Something else, I thought, remembering back to my childhood love of sandwiches, especially peanut butter and jelly.  What else could I make for lunch that he would eat? Sometimes I am lucky enough to have leftovers from the night before but more times than not, this sprouting seven year old cleans up everything served to him at dinner, leaving nothing for lunch the next day.  I tried to disguise sandwiches for awhile, making them on a bagel or packing his two favorite food items-salsa and humus and a rice cake instead of the usual whole grain bread.  But alas, he caught on and I was left wondering how creative a mom could be at 5:30 in the morning while loading a lunchbox. <br /> <br />Along came \\"The Vegetarian Culinarians Make Sandwiches,\\" cookbook just in the nick of time.  There are no ordinary sandwiches in this no -frills book but instead, mini meals many of which don't even resemble the common sandwich.  One of their warm sandwiches is toasted peanut butter and cherry, using canned cherry filling.  Their version of peanut butter and jelly is a Hawaiian peanut butter roll up.  The recipes in the book have unending creativity and have inspired me to re-think the whole lunch scene.  Many however are not as healthy as I would like.  For instance, some of the ingredients include white bread-something we rarely eat.  There is also cheese in nearly every recipe, which we avoid.  In fact the cookbook is much more vegetarian-friendly than vegan.  But most of the recipes are easy enough to adapt to individual needs (I just substituted soy cheese rather than the real stuff for recipes that called for cheese).   <br /> <br />The bottom line is that when I think sandwich, I no longer think ordinary peanut butter and jelly or even rice cakes with salsa and humus.  Now I think Big Dippers, an Italianbread concoction that is broiled and dipped into pasta sauce.  I think fruit and cream sandwiches with cream cheese spread, jam, and an apple.  I think Crunchy Chinese Pita Pockets.  I think fast, wholesome, and delicious.  I think my son will be the envy of his lunch table! <br /> <br />The sandwiches in this cookbook are simple to prepare and many use ingredients that you probably already have in your cupboard or refrigerator.  On a rushed school morning, or any time when lunches are being made, that can only mean good news for those of us doing the preparing.--Carol LaLiberte <br />	2004-11-01

Author Alanna Mitchell, who was named the best environmental reporter in the world by the World Conservation Union and the Reuters Foundation, writes about several environmental catastrophes that are taking place including the effects global warming is having on the Arctic, the destruction of wetlands in Jordan where species are going extinct \\"at the rate of about one a year,\\" and deforestation in Madagascar which, according to Mitchell, \\"is the world's top extinction hotspot.\\"  <br /> <br />While some of Mitchell's observations of how our species is destroying the very ecosystems we depend on for life are depressing, other prominent people's views on how destructive our species is are further disturbing.  <br /> <br />\\"Leakey, the eminent Kenyan paleoanthropologist and authority on human evolution, is convinced that humans are poised to become 'the greatest catastrophic agent' the world has ever seen, a highly intelligent, highly lethal species set to destroy billions of years of evolutionary advances.\\"  <br /> <br />Much of Mitchell's book looks at how humans have decimated the planet, but she also writes about some environmental success stories including how Suriname's rainforest, thanks to conservationists, is almost entirely intact. Mitchell, in the chapter \\"Iceland's New Power\\" reports on how Iceland is \\"doing away with fossil fuels in favor of harnessing the mythical energy of hydrogen,\\" and how, in the next couple of decades, they will switch their cars and ships to hydrogen and then won't require any oil.  <br /> <br />Dancing at the Dead Sea is a fascinating, sometimes disturbing, book, but it is one which needs to be read. If we are to overcome our destructive, short-sighted ways and begin living in harmony with the other species, we need to be fully aware of what we're capable of - both in terms of causing environmental catastrophes and healing the planet. --Glenn Perrett	2004-10-05

The mother-infant relationship of chimpanzees is similar to that of humans, and children will be educated and entertained by this delightful series of eight books describing the loving relationship of a young chimp and his mother.  <br /> <br />The first book in the series, Okomi: The New Baby, introduces the reader to Mama Du, an important female chimpanzee, her recently born baby, Okomi, Okomi's father, Dada Du, and their life in an African forest.  <br /> <br />The second book, Okomi and the Tickling Game, finds Okomi and his mother lying in the shade on a hot summer day. After waking up from her nap Mama Du tickles a sleepy Okomi until she becomes tired. Okomi then decides to tickle his mother and they enjoy the \\"tickling game\\" until they become hungry, hug and go off to find some food.  <br /> <br />Further stories find Okomi having fun playing in leaves and learning to climb a tree. Okomi Enjoys His Outings describes new things that the young chimp discovers when on a walk with his mother, while Okomi Wakes Up Early finds an energetic and playful Okomi having fun under the watchful eyes of a patient and loving mother.  <br /> <br />Okomi Goes \\"Fishing\\" has Mama Du teaching her young son how to get termites out of their hill and eat them, and Okomi Wanders Too Far tells how the baby chimp wanders off and temporarily gets separated from his mother.  <br /> <br />The stories are very simple and describe situations that young children will relate to. Children will also learn about chimpanzees as the stories are \\"based upon real events and natural chimp behavior in the wild as observed by Jane Goodall.\\" The first time that I read one of the Okomi books to our son Liam, he liked it so much that I had to immediately read it to him two more times!  <br /> <br />Some of the proceeds from the sale of the Okomi books supports the work of The Jane Goodall Institute's Tchimpounga Sanctuary in the Congo Republic where there are more than 100 orphan chimpanzees. --Glenn Perrett	2004-10-05

The Nature Upclose Series is an informative and entertaining series consisting of 13 books for young children about various animals (and dandelions) that they're likely to come across. Pill bugs, luna moths, earthworms and slugs are just a few of the interesting creatures featured in these books by author and illustrator John Himmelman. In these books the species' life cycle and some of the roles that they play in nature are briefly looked at.  <br /> <br />I particularly like this series because it features several species that our species is either ignorant of or despises. By educating children about the wondrous lives of species that we don't like or don't know much about, we are able to teach our children that all species are important and deserving of our respect.  <br /> <br />Himmelman's simple text and full color illustrations will hold a child's attention. At the back of each book there is a \\"Words You Know\\" section where simple definitions are given for words found in the book. For example, in the book A House Spider's Life brief definitions are given for: egg sac, house fly, silk, spiderling and yellow jacket. This section can help an adult better explain certain terms to a child and also highlights some words that may need defining or emphasizing during the story.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-01

Taking prescription drugs or herbs while breastfeeding can be risky unless moms have good information about how it may affect her breastmilk and her baby.<br />Fortunately, books like Thomas Hale's Medications and Mothers Milk (2004 edition now available), and The Nursing Mother's Herbal by Sheila Humphrey can help nursing moms navigate pharmaceutical and natural remedies while breastfeeding. Moms who don't know anything about herbs as well as moms who have used them to treat common ailments will find The Nursing Mother's Herbal helpful.<br />Unlike the technical Hale book, which deals with prescription drugs (most La Leche League chapters own and can offer information from this book to share with your health care provider), The Nursing Mother's Herbal is an easy-to-read book about breastfeeding, herbs and dietary supplements. <br />The book's conversational style is backed up by serious, solid research. Humphrey, an IBCLC-certified lactation consultant, has studied botany at the college level. She is also an ob-gyn nurse and La Leche League leader. Her information sources for the book include her husband, a PhD botanist specializing in the study of medicinal plant pharmacology and ethnobotany; a long list of herb experts, including Andrew Weil; and breastfeeding experts, including Dr. Jack Newman and members of La Leche League. <br />For new moms, The Nursing Mother's Herbal devotes the first three chapters entirely to breastfeeding. It is an excellent explanation of all the factors that play into a positive nursing experience for moms and babies. Humphrey explains why breastmilk is the superior infant food, then she explores where to find breastfeeding information and support. Finally, she offers a peek into the amazing nursing mother-baby dyad. <br />For moms new to herbs, the following chapter is dedicated to explaining herbs and herbal medicines: What's a tincture? What is the difference between a decoction and a liquid extract? How do I know I am getting a quality herbal product?<br />Humphrey inserts many warnings throughout the initial chapter on herbs, including why it's important to make sure you have the right plant if gathering herbs from a garden or from the wild (some toxic plants look very similar to herbs), so this chapter is a critical read before moving onto the rest of the book. Many herbs interact with prescription drugs, so it is important to tell your health care provider about any herbs or nutritional supplements you take. Humphrey offers extra safety measures to apply when using herbs while breastfeeding, including: \\"When breastfeeding, it may be best to avoid those herbs that can cause side effects even in small doses; instead find herbs with a wider margin of safety.\\"<br />Even so, she writes: \\"Despite all the concerns I've brought up here, please do not get the impression that herbs are dangerous. As a group, herbs are probably safer than most types of other medications.\\"<br />The following chapters offer specific herbal remedies to various ailments or situations breastfeeding mothers may encounter, such as herbs related to weaning. Information-packed appendices at the end of the book provide further resources to explore as well as plant safety charts.<br />As with any book related to health, it is not a substitute for professional medical advice. However, The Nursing Mother's Herbal is a wonderful resource for moms to inform themselves about natural remedies and to gather information to share with their physicians about alternative treatments to common health problems. --Dana Anderson-Villamagna	2004-06-02

At the end of the book are a simple maze and a drawing page. Tucker has his very own web site at [...] where you can see some of the gorgeous illustrations. Our children, ages two and six love this book, and I appreciate the message they learn about the benefits of avoiding pesticides. Buying organic makes a real difference, and that message comes through loud and clear in this book!--Melanie Wilson	2004-04-27

This 16-page coloring book is a fabulous learning tool for kids, and contrary to what you might think, considering who authored it (PETA, THE animal rights people), it's very mild in it's message. Rather, it's an educational coloring book with great drawings of animals, from dogs and cats to lobsters and chimpanzees. Each page is devoted to one animal and includes factual information that will appeal to children, as well as some information about how animals are used by humans: \\"Dogs are related to wolves - have you ever heard a dog howl with a fire siren?...Dogs come in many shapes and sizes, but it doesn't matter what they look like - a mixed-breed dog from the animal shelter can be smarter and sweeter than a purebred pooch...\\" or \\"Did you know that chimpanzees can use sticks and rocks like spoons and hammers, and they can find plant medicines in the jungle? Some people put chimpanzees in cages, in laboratories, or train them to 'act' in shows...\\" Each page also includes a DID YOU KNOW box with a short factual statement that will be easy for kids to remember, like \\"Raccoons eat at night and rest during the day...\\" My six-year-old has used this in her homeschooling as part of the animals curriculum, and she likes that the back cover has samples of the pages already colored in for her to copy. We definitely recommend it for older children who are ready to learn the basics of the true role of animals in the human world as well as lots of interesting animal history and trivia.--Melanie Wilson	2004-04-27

It's not an easy task to raise compassionate, non-materialistic, and socially conscious children in today's prevailing culture. Above All, Be Kind is a guidebook for parents trying to do just that. <br />Author Zoe Weil is the co-founder of the International Institute for Humane Education, an organization that teaches young people about more humane ways of living and about how our daily choices impact the world for ill or good. She says living in humane ways is all about living up to the highest human qualities. <br />Weil gives examples of situations parents will likely encounter with their children (\\"What do you do when your son asks for a toy gun?\\" \\"What do you do when you find pornography in your teen's room?\\") and how parents can handle those situations with wisdom. <br />In segments called \\"Did you know?\\" she reveals disturbing facts about hot button social issues such as factory farming, sweatshop clothing, and child-targeted advertising. Besides documenting the facts about those issues, Weil takes the process a step further with pages called \\"Let Kindness Grow,\\" which offer suggestions about what we can do to make more humane choices in relation to each issue. <br />The most important message in the book is to parents themselves. It is the mantra \\"My life is my message,\\" which Weil says she has used many times to check her own behavior. The Ghandian quote reminds parents that we cannot expect our children to walk any path that we ourselves are not willing or able to walk. <br />To that end, Weil lays out a four-step plan she calls the \\"Four Elements\\" that can help readers come to a right action for themselves or help their children make about any choice. Essentially, the Four Elements are: Gathering information, using critical thinking skills, turning that knowledge into respect for all, and making a responsible choice. <br />One of the last parts of the book is dedicated to personal introspection. Weil created a \\"My life is my message\\" questionnaire that readers are to work through to critically look at where we can improve our own life messages. The 13-page exercise is a humbling and valuable experience. <br />Weil provides an appendix bursting with solid statistics, valuable reference books, and tons of resources to help parents locate more information, better products (such as a list of companies that do not use animals to test products) and websites that can help us make more humane choices for ourselves, our children, and the world. As a result, this book is not a one-time read but rather a resource to be picked up time and again. --Dana Anderson-Villamagna	2004-03-25

It was a warm summer's eve, on the anniversary of my first kiss. Angie and I wanted to go out and celebrate, so I could forget about the long-lost first-kiss-boy. We stepped into Juice for Life, after we'd chosen it from a list of Toronto vegetarian restaurants. The lights were low, the room was bustling, and a delicious aroma rested on the air. We sat at a quiet, two person, wooden table near the back. As the friendly waitress handed us the menus, we were shocked to see pages upon pages of juice selections-everything from &quot;Lust for Life&quot; to &quot;First Kiss&quot; (how appropriate). The meal selections were just as unique and bountiful, boasting health and great taste. We ordered. I drank a &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; juice, and savored a vegan carrot cake. Never had I tasted such delicious, healthy and animal-friendly cuisine. We returned several times while I was in Toronto-for lunches, breakfasts and dinners! It went without saying, then, that I'd bought their much-acclaimed cookbook, entitled &quot;Juice For Life-Modern Food and Luscious Juice.&quot; <br />The founder of Juice for Life, Ruth Tal Brown, began her now-successful business as a travelling juice bar, which later evolved into a permanent location at a former chicken slaughterhouse. Today, there are several JFL branches scattered throughout downtown Toronto, with famous diners such as Alanis Morissette, Lenny Kravitz and Reese Witherspoon. The restaurant has won numerous awards for it's fab food, too; it was voted Best Vegetarian Restaurant four years in a row by Now Magazine, three years in a row by Eye Weekly, and two years in a row by Toronto Sun newspaper. For those of us who aren't able to make it to this metropolitan city, we turn to the aforementioned Juice for Life cookbook, which enables us to enjoy all the same great tastes of the restaurant's juices and meals at home. <br />Since I purchased this cookbook, each and every recipe I have tried has left empty plates and diners begging, craving for seconds, thirds - even fourths! Every recipe is out of the ordinary, with unique twists, delicious flavors, and surprisingly, numerous health benefits. Who knew healthy food could taste this good? This was one of the aims of Ruth Tal Brown - to make healthful, vegan food taste great. The book is divided into two sections: Luscious Juice and Modern Food. Each section offers tips and information on the recipes, cooking preparation and equipment, as well as details of various ingredients throughout the pages. Some of the recipes are a little time consuming, but the wait is well worth it. My favorite recipes include the Fez Pita (baked eggplant, roasted zucchini, sundried tomatoes and yummy hummus) and the Jerusalem Rice Bowl (basmati rice, tahini sauce, hummus and herbs). The Luscious Juice section is quite large, subdividing into categories like &quot;Energy Elixirs and Vital Fluids,&quot; and &quot;Super Power Shakes.&quot; <br />The book is completely vegan, save for a few recipes that contain honey. I definitely recommended it to anyone who craves an exciting meal, who wants to surprise the taste buds with an unforgettable dining experience, and leave their body nourished and healthful. Juice for Life, from that summer night a few years back, has found a permanent and essential home in my kitchen. --Jessica Alleva	2004-03-25

Nava Atlas' brand new cookbook has given me motivation to cook again!! With two picky vegetarian children and no time to cook, it has been difficult lately to even think of meal ideas. Atlas' newest cookbook gives great suggestions, is designed to be a great time saver, and is perfect for vegetarian and vegan families. It is a wonderful addition to my family's bookshelf. <br />This book is easy to read and easy to use. It is divided into a number of sections including: Easy Breakfast Treats, Soothing Soups &amp; Salads, Pasta, Tofu &amp; Seitan, Vegetables and Grains, Easy Side dishes, Sandwiches and School Lunches, Healthy Snacks and Baked Goods. <br />I really appreciate that most of the recipes have easy-to-find ingredients and are simple to make. Many of Atlas' ingredients are already in your kitchen. Each recipe is clearly marked whether it contains dairy or eggs and most of the recipes include variations. I also love how she makes it easier for readers to plan meals by noting accompanying side dishes and their page numbers. This makes it so easy to serve a complete and delicious meal without frantically having to think of accompaniments. <br />In addition to the recipes, Atlas discusses vegetarian eating and other topics including pesticides in our food, the vegetarian food pyramid, and websites dedicated to vegetarian and vegan lifestyles.--Denise Steele-Darnell	2004-03-02

Eating for Beauty was written with raw food enthusiasts in mind. The raw food diet is most certainly about beauty: the beauty of nature, the beauty of health, and the beauty of body, mind and soul. David Wolfe, the author of Eating for Beauty, is a shining example of beauty and health in the raw food movement. He has been a leading authority and educator on raw foods for years. In this book, he reveals how to shine with the beauty that is already present within you. <br />When I first heard that David Wolfe had written a book titled Eating for Beauty, I was a bit put off. I thought it was going to be shallow, just focusing on how to be more physically attractive. But as I read this book from cover to cover, I was quite impressed. He makes a very logical point that by the eating certain foods, we are in fact creating a certain person. We are made from the food we eat, in a very literal sense. The more life force we eat, the more life force we will have in our bodies. The body uses vitamins and minerals to nourish our organs, such as the skin, hair and eyes. Clear, glowing skin, strong nails and bright eyes are all signs of a healthy, well nourished body, and they're all benefits of a raw food diet. <br />David Wolfe goes into great detail about some of the most beautifying foods on the planet. He dedicates a section to each of the following: aloe vera, arugula, burdock, coconuts, cucumbers, durian, figs, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, nettles, olives, onions, papaya, pumpkin seeds, radishes, turmeric, and watercress. These foods contain high amounts of \\"beauty minerals,\\" like silicon and sulfur. They are also very cleansing and energizing. Papaya is especially high in natural enzymes, and durian contains tryptophan, an amino acid that helps elevate seretonin levels in the brain. Coconut contains a very unique substance called lauric acid, which is incredibly antifungal and antiviral. The fats found in coconut, hemp seeds, and macadamia nuts are extremely nourishing. When included in a balanced raw diet, these foods have the power to transform your body and mind. <br />Besides listing specific foods, he also talks generally about which foods are best and which foods should be avoided. For instance, when choosing what to eat, go for foods that most closely resemble foods found in the wild. These foods will contain more minerals and stronger life energy. Many fruits and vegetables today are hybrids and have been genetically modified to be low in nutrition and high in sugar. This book does a great job in educating its reader about which foods are TRULY health foods, and which are not. You may be surprised! <br />Mental diet - feeding the mind through thought - is also an important element of beauty. A positive outlook and an enthusiastic demeanor will give you a glow and attract others with similar vibrations. A smile is by far the best, and cheapest, accessory you can wear to become more beautiful. <br />Yoga also creates a beautiful body by strengthening muscles and creating symmetry through balance and grace. Yoga enables muscles to release stagnant energy and increase the flow of life force throughout the body. This is very important when trying to cultivate a beautiful glow. Exercise provides the cells with oxygen, while stretching helps the organs and muscles to release toxins and rejuvenate. <br />I especially loved the Kirlian photography pictures throughout the book. Kirlian photography is a way of actually measuring the energy and life in a certain food. The pictures of raw organic food shine with light as if electricity were circulating through the veins of the plant, where as the cooked food looks dull and lifeless. People speak of the \\"life force\\" in raw foods, calling the raw diet a \\"living foods diet.\\" Through Kirlian photography it's easy to see just how blatantly real this concept is. The photographs are so beautiful, especially the picture of the starfruit, which has an amazingly symmetrical energy field. I would love to have one of these photographs magnified and made into a poster for my room! <br />Near the end of the book there are some amazing testimonials to the raw food beauty diet. You will see through these testimonials that others have overcome many serious health problems and regained their health and vibrancy through raw foods. Reading their stories, their insights, and their wisdom will inspire you to incorporate Eating for Beauty into your own life and being. <br />While Eating for Beauty does indeed focus on physical beauty, it focuses on that beauty which is already present, that natural beauty which all human beings posses, if we would only let the light shine through. Raw foods, yoga, proper sleep and a positive outlook with a heart full of love will without a doubt overwhelm you with your ever-existing beauty. If becoming more of who you are (more beautiful) is something that you're interested in, than this book was written for you! Thank you David Wolfe for sharing with us, through Eating for Beauty, your incredible wealth of knowledge and insight. Eat for life, love and happiness, and you will be Eating for Beauty! --reviewed by Anna Hays	2004-02-17

Remember when you first learned that people can live without eating meat? It was radical thinking at first because, after all, vegetarianism turns upside down all the rules we learned through childhood about health. It rearranges facts that we've held so dear throughout the years: that meat is good for us; that it's necessary for good health; that we're, by nature, obligated to eating it. For many people, reading John Robbins' Diet For a New America was a turning point - the book that flicked the switch in thousands of people's brains. We don't need meat! Suddenly a radical concept became normal. They vowed to stop eating animal products because the information Robbins presents is undeniable and inspirational. It simply made sense. <br />Jed Gillen is the John Robbins of the pet food industry. His book, Obligate Carnivore, exposes vegan guilt, vegan hypocrisy - that we are so firm about avoiding animal products, but we (gasp!) buy them for our companion animals. The book offers up evidence that cats can live healthy, happy lives without meat products with a little help from supplemental taurine. It doesn't focus on dogs because dogs don't require taurine for health, stripping them from the &quot;obligate carnivore&quot; label. <br />One of the many insights Gillen has is the leather shoe commentary. If you've ever been to an animal rights protest, you've probably had someone yell out to you, &quot;Your shoes are made of leather, though!&quot; Well, no, actually, they're synthetic. So there! Where they would really trump us is if they yelled out, &quot;You feed your cat meat, though!&quot; Hmmm. You got me there. <br />Obligate Carnivore is a good laugh, considering it's riddled with very serious considerations about cat health and the downer topic of farm animal abuse. Once I got accustomed to his humor (it took a few pages), I found Jed upbeat, fun, and bold. Chapter titles include &quot;I Was a Vegetarian Idiot&quot; and &quot;Gwagwagwe.&quot; This last one had melaughing out loud for at least five minutes. That's a long time laughing; I thought I wasn't going to stop. <br />A smile creeps to my face remembering the chapter &quot;The Aching-Ass Equation.&quot; <br />Without the humor, Obligate Carnivore would sound to a carnivore cat guardian like an annoying vegetarian to a meateater - a vegetarian who spews out facts that the meateater just isn't open to hearing. Even if you're unwilling to change your cat's diet, the perspective in this book is absolutely imperative to examine if you don't eat meat for ethical reasons. Vegetarians pride themselves in being committed to exploring the truth of health, environment and animal welfare issues. Therefore, if evidence suggests (and healthy cats prove) that vegan diets work, the obligation is to take a look. <br />&quot;You're not feeding your cats and dog meat? You're crazy!&quot; Ah, but I'm not. I'm just vegan. --Reviewed by Caity McCardell	2004-02-17

It's not news that the government and big business have led us astray on multiple levels. Pick up any Adbusters or Mother Jones magazine and you'll find a plethora of ways corporations have sold the environment, animals and human health to the highest bidder. What's fun (or horrific, depending on your mood) is learning the specifics. Seeds of Deception delves into the details of genetically modified (GM) food: what we should know about the politics, science and investment behind the industry. <br />One of the many issues the book raises is that GM food is almost impossible to distinguish, since it's generally not labeled here in the United States. Companies, such as Monsanto, spend millions, if not billions, of dollars keeping the public happy and ignorant about the lack of testing behind their products. They even have some pretty smart folks believing GM food is going to feed the world and cure blindness in Third World countries. It's taken a lot of dough to create that groupthink. As we've learned from pharmaceuticals, the cigarette industry and the meat and dairy industries, when a company is willing to spend that kind of money on public relations, someone's putting frosting on a mud pie. <br />Peppered with anecdotes about animals choosing non-GM food over GM food, Smith's evidence of scientific and political cover-up is startling. It's impossible to ignore the evidence in this book. Even if only a fraction of it is true, we're in some serious crap. The problem comes down to a simple statement Smith quotes from geneticist, David Suzuki: \\"Any politician or scientist who tells you these products are safe is either very stupid or lying. The experiments have simply not been done.\\" <br />Seeds of Deception's chapter \\"Muscling the Media\\" discusses corporate strategy to eliminate media reporting on GM food in the United States. \\"Under the auspices of the public relations and lobby firm Capitoline/MS&L, they [GM giant Monsanto] created a plan to identify and then stiflethose reporters and reports that were critical of rbGH.\\" (rbGH is the infamous growth hormone that makes cows produce more milk - horrible stuff.) The question remains: Doesn't Smith worry about being slammed and discarded like the many journalists and writers he describes? His book isn't going to show up on Oprah anytime soon - or is it? If enough people consider the seriousness of the topic, Seeds of Deception won't fall by the wayside. <br />If you have room for another New Year's resolution, please let it be to follow the suggestions in this book. Eat organic, locally-produced food. Feed your children organic food and encourage schools to look into the realities of GM food in their cafeterias. Avoid certain foods altogether (like non-organic papaya from Hawaii, for example, which has a 50% chance of being GM) and encourage restaurants to eliminate GM food from their menus. <br />Seeds of Deception will open your eyes - eyes that, from then on, will search for organic alternatives to take-your-chances, you-might-be-a-guinea-pig ingredients. It has been praised for reading like an exciting novel, and I agree it's quite a thriller. If only this terrifying exposé were fiction. --Reviewed by Caity McCardell	2004-02-17

That's the verdict from my six-year-old on Frannie and Pickles, a whimsically illustrated story of the special bond between an elderly woman and her animal companion. The bond intensifies page by page. Somehow, Frannie becomes her dog Pickles, and vice versa. Frannie catches a Frisbee in her mouth. Pickles wins a bridge game. While my son was laughing at the narrative, my two-year-old enjoyed searching the delicately detailed pictures for the subtext story of a gang of mice who are terrorizing cats. What were those mice going to do next? In a corner of the final page, the barbarous mice, in caveman skins, are gathered around a tiny barbecue. No! Are they going to eat roasted cat!? My family goes through stacks of children's library books and finds that an occasional book is a definite \\"keeper.\\" This book is one of those you can read over and over for new discoveries; the story is so subtle and poetic that there endless messages to be gleaned from it. My six-year-old and I discussed a different ethical aspect of how living beings treat one another at each reading. My two-year-old never tired of looking for those mice!

Books	5	21	21	N	N	A Dancer's Delight	This book has won several awards including the Gourmand World Cookbook Award and the ForeWord Magazine's Book of the Year. I was shocked at the actual quality of the book. The publishing is excellent.<BR><br /><BR>As a dancer, I know that one thing you have to maintain is discipline, and with all the tempting recipes out there, it's hard. Surely one of the most attractive things about this cookbook is its pictures. Almost every other page has a beautiful photo of one of the recipes. At the beginning of each chapter, there's a picture of a dancer, and these alone make the book worth buying. Alright, enough said about the images - let's consider the food.<BR><br /><BR>I was really surprised to find that one of my favorite recipes was an appetizer. Edamame, which I'm really not sure how to pronounce, is simply prepared, salted soy beans, which you take out of the pods and eat. They aren't too filling and they make a great replacement for the traditional crackers and cheeseball appetizer.<BR><br /><BR>The second section of the book is devoted to soups. While these aren't entirely easy to make, all the preparation is well worthwhile. The Gazpacho Andazul was my favorite; it's basically a really complicated version of tomato soup. It tastes like something that you would get in a cafe in Europe, but maybe that's just me. There are a lot of spices added in, so if you accidentally overdo it a bit, it can taste rather strong. (By the way, there are a ton of adorable cooking quotes scattered throughout the pages, and for this soup the quote is &quot;Only the pure of heart can make a good soup.&quot;)<BR><br /><BR>Moving on to third chapter, the salad selections are phenomenal. There are recipes for European salads, like the Taboulleh with Shredded Baby Spinach, which is really good and the Panzanella, which includes a recipe for the dressing as well. I don't know if you are anything like I am, but I'm not entirely used to gourmet food. I'm the girl who ends up getting the tossed salad and mixed vegetables in most restaurants, so it takes a bit of getting used to. But if you give them a chance, you won't be sorry.<BR><br /><BR>A lot of these recipes are not veg, so you may have to weed through the ones you don't want to try. Lucky for us, there is an entire section devoted to Vegetarian and Meatless Entrees! Many of these recipes took the longest to prepare, especially the Fresh Spinach, Roasted Eggplant, and Mushroom Lasagna. While this took a while, it serves eight and you can easily hang on to the leftovers. There are a lot of other really great meatless recipes including sesame noodles and a really great pizza recipe. But this is one section where some of the more culturally diverse food comes in. The curried banana balls were a bit different, I'll admit, but it doesn't hurt to try them once.<BR><br /><BR>Lastly, we have the land of desserts. No complaints here! These were amazing with a couple of great biscotti recipes and  Irish soda bread. There is also an applesauce carrot cake that is to die for.<BR><br /><BR>In the back of the book is a glossary filled with both ballet and cooking terms and more pictures. It's a great ending to a great cookbook. Overall, I would highly suggest adding this to your kitchen. It is a great way to impress any guest that comes along and an even better way to treat yourself.--Courtney Jones	2003-12-22

Through it all, his mission has remained the same - to protect the whales. <BR><br /><BR>An early history of the whaling industry, as well as that of Greenpeace, (originally known as the Don't Make A Wave Committee), is covered extensively. Modern day whaling practices are explained - including ways in which some countries continue to thwart the worldwide ban on whaling practices by claiming they are hunting the mammals for the purpose of science. <BR><br /><BR>Written in easy to understand terms (in other words, you don't have to be a biologist to get it), this book is an entertaining and interesting read, although some readers might be offended by the frequent use of colorful language. Especially enjoyable is the passage describing the majesty of icebergs, &quot;I pictured them building up slowly over millions and millions of years and then one day, with a violent, ear-shattering crack, breaking away from the ice shelf and setting off on their own.

If Americans would only slow down, turn off their TV's/cars/stereos/computers, and get together with one another; then amazing things would happen for us, the environment, and the animals. <br />This book contains interesting bits of information designed to inspire the reader and spur them to action. From it we learn that \\"since 1940, Americans alone have used up as large a share of the Earth's mineral resources as all previous humans put together.\\" Despite dire proclamations of American wastefulness there are plenty of suggestions on correcting the imbalance. Ideas such as \\"green\\" businesses, reduced meat consumption, developing alternative fuels, and a renaissance of the arts are proposed. <br />This book not only deals with the external world but also the internal world. It offers ideas designed to bring contentment without ever opening up a wallet or swiping a credit card. Suggested activities include holding a song circle, a story swap, or even just taking a sheet of homemade brownies to a neighbor and introducing yourself. <br />I enjoyed this book and the message it conveyed. The free response questions in the opening section of the book are of particular interest. I took the time to really think about my answers to questions such as \\"What makes you happy?\\" and \\"What do you want from life?\\" I came up with some interesting and even surprising answers. I am sure you will do the same if you read this little gem of a book. --Reviewed by Kristin Daniels	2003-08-18

Coetzee is a philosophical look at the heart of vegetarianism and animal suffering rather than a discussion of the hard raw facts that most books include on the subject. It takes a look at both sides of the issue, including some hypothetical thought-provoking questions from the \\"opposition\\". This is done in the form of a short novel in which author Elizabeth Costello is invited to give two lectures to her literary peers. <br />She chooses to deliver her talks about the plight of animals, not by relating facts about slaughterhouses and veal crates, but by establishing certain theoretical truths about the way animals think and feel. \\"Reminding you only that the horrors I here omit are nevertheless at the center of this lecture,\\" she says. <br />Coetzee's book presents the case for animal rights in a way I had never seen before. It offers some good answers for those who ask about our vegetarianism, and it raised many questions for us to answer for ourselves. The Lives of Animals reaffirmed why I had chosen this lifestyle in the first place and strengthened my resolution. No longer do I do this simply because I can't bear to be a cause of suffering, but rather because animals - as thinking, emotional beings - deserve it. A highly recommended this book that will renew convictions, but since it's heavy in philosophy it can be a little hard to follow. A collection of essays by various contributors following the story helps to clarify and extend the message of the book. --Reviewed by Rachel Crowley	2003-08-18

It covers a wide variety of topics - everything from common myths, to nutrition, to the names of animal ingredients and what they are. The book is set up in a way that's easy to read. You could use it as a reference guide to let you know if a certian product contains animal ingredients, but my personal favorite chapter is the one on nutrition. Many new vegans have concerns about what vitamins they need and where to get them from. This book explains it all. I give it two thumbs up. I highly recommend everyone buy and read it several times. It's a very nice addition to any book collection. --Reviewed by Melissa White	2003-08-18

All of the humans lives depend on one small, stowaway hen, who thinks she is TOO small to make a difference, but in the end makes a REALLY big differance on the little green planet and their views of how \\"inferior\\" humans are. <br />This book, with it's large print, makes a great book for kids of all ages!

I'm trying to convince my World Studies and U.S. History teachers to use this book as a part of the curriculum. Eternal Treblinka compares the disgustingly similar Holocausts of the Jewish during World War II and of the animals throughout history. The book also gives very important background information on the history of animal abuse and who was responsible for the genocide of the Jewish. It's surprisingly easy to read and it's amazing where he gets all this information. The book is divided into three parts: A Fundamental Debacle (I), Master Species, Master Race (II), and Holocaust Echoes (III). Each part is introduced by a quote(s) relating to the topics of the chapters. <br />\\"A Fundamental Debacle\\" talks about when animal abuse began and discusses the controversial subject of whether or not animals were put on earth for humans' needs. \\"Master Species, Master Race\\" describes what caused the Holocaust and every person responsible for carrying out the Final Solution (the scientists, slaughterhouse employees, Henry Ford, and Hitler himself) and the story of how slaughterhouses were established. Chapter three, \\"The Industrialization of Slaughter\\" includes quotes and paragraphs about the classic novel The Jungle by Upton Sinclair. And finally, \\"Holocaust Echoes\\" is comprised of the stories of animal rights activists who have been affected by the Holocaust, including Peter Singer and the Nobel Prize winner and Yiddish writer Isaac Bashevis Singer. <br />Also, this book isn't only about the Holocaust of the Jewish; it also talks about the mass murders of the Chinese during World War II, the infamous genocide of the Native Americans, the conquest of Africa and the Philippines, the dehumanization of the Vietnamese and what happened to the Japanese during the bombing of Pearl Harbor. This is a wonderful book and anybody who's interested in history should own a copy. I learned more history from reading this book than in my history classes. I knew more about the Holocaust than my teachers did, which was handy when I argue with them. --Reviewed by Angie Lau	2003-08-18

While the book is almost overly detailed at some points, Cox's use of evidence supports his conclusion that veganism is not only an animal rights choice but a health conscious decision. This gives vegans, like myself, plenty to reference when told that meat and dairy are essential to a healthy diet. <br />The book includes a long section about Mad Cow Disease that is both horrifying and shocking, a description of the inhumane treatment of pigs in slaughterhouses, and a series of frequently asked questions and answers. Furthermore, the text contains a portion discussing major contemporary diseases such as cancer and diabetes, the connection to meat and dairy consumption, and alternative ways of treatment or prevention (usually through a vegan diet). In each part of the book, Cox expands on his topic writing with extreme precision and minute attention. This means the reader must be very interested, at some points, to remain engaged. Overall, though, by using humor and simple explanatory language, the complex issues explored by Cox prove easy to understand. Those who succeed in carefully reading through his arguments and evidence are handsomely rewarded with a wealth of knowledge. <br />You Don't Need Meat proves to be an educational text providing more reasons to choose or continue a vegan lifestyle. This makes it an intriguing and informative book for both the devout vegan and the meat-eater unconvinced by animal rights arguments. --Reviewed by Ellen Roggeman	2003-08-18

Since her heroic act of sitting a tree called Luna to prevent it from being cut down (along with many other giant sequoia trees), she has been an inspiration to many. This book is filled with the inspiring tales of people who are like Julia Hill, who do care and who have made a difference in our world. It also is packed with information on all sorts of environmental issues from water conservation to the clear-cutting of trees to to the very positive effects of vegetarianism on the environment. It has lists of the things you can do in your everyday life to make a difference. It lets you know that even the smallest things do make a difference.

My English class read the book Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser for an assignment. This best-seller traces the evolution of fast food, its corrupt business practices, and its cultural influences. <br />A large part of the book discusses how workers in the chain of supply are treated. Schlosser gives examples of ranchers forced to sell their cattle with nearly no profit, the immigrants who slaughter the animals for little pay and no job security, and the exploited teenagers who sell the final product. <br />Another big topic of the book focuses on the workings of huge corporations like IBP (Iowa Beef Producers) and ConAgra foods, which are the largest suppliers to fast food chains. It reveals their political activities such as lobbying to keep the government out of food safety inspections and for a lower minimum wage. <br />Other than ending with an epilogue about mad cow disease, the book mentions little about animals (Schlosser does make an incorrect reference to \\"humane\\" slaughter in an earlier chapter, though). This fact makes the case against meat production even stronger; those uninterested (or even opposed) to animal rights will find it unsettlingly hard to ignore so many human rights violations within the industry. When first beginning to read this book in my English class, I tried to explain how slaughterhouses were some of the most dangerous workplaces in the world, but most of my classmates did not believe me. By the end of the book, they were all upset about the almost non-existent safety standards. <br />Fast Food Nation makes vegetarianism more appealing and really backs the claim that it is the healthiest and most all-around responsible diet by exposing how unethically the big food corporations deal with everything, not just their cattle. --Reviewed by Rachel Crowley	2003-08-18

On the whole, Speaking Out for Animals by Kim Stallwood is written in a hopeful and progressive style - certainly it's worth a read. But as I read the heartwarming stories, I definitely felt mixed emotions. On the one hand, it is good to hear happy endings. On the other hand, it is terrible to think that humans could be responsible for so much suffering and cruelty. <br />This book's greatest fault, in my opinion, is the first 24 pages. I found myself nearly in despair, thinking 209 more pages, what if it's all like this! Fortunately, it is not all that bad. After I got through the relatively short and somewhat dull interviews, I finally reached something good. The interview with Sergeant Sherry Schlueter was just the first of a series of ten interesting and varied stories. I especially enjoyed reading how animal rights are viewed abroad, in the interviews with Maneka Gandhi of India and Tatyana Pavlova in Russia. <br />To often, it seems, I hear terrible stories of animal suffering. All this bad news can become quite overwhelming. That's why I like section two of this book, all 31 of these stories are strictly happy endings. From Ginny, the dog who rescues cats to Butch and Sundance, two runaway meat pigs, this section will leave you feeling good. <br />Section three is titled \\"Unsung Heroes,\\" and I also found it to be interesting and inspiring. Tony and Vicki Moore who fought against Spain's blood fiestas, the Buffalo Field Campaign fighting for the wild buffalo and eight-year-old Amanda Walker-Serrano, alerting others to the truth about circuses. These three stories are among 21 true tales of animal heroes. --Reviewed by Starlynn Clarke	2003-08-18

From the moment I saw this book offered for sale in Farm Sanctuary's quarterly newsletter I wanted to read it. In the Judeo-Christian ethic, the concept of \\"dominion\\" is used to excuse every variety of human cruelty. Few among us haven't had to argue over Genesis 1:28 - \\"Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.\\" Even those of us who are not members of the faith will hear this verse come up when we talk about vegetarianism with others who are. This book amply counters that often-misapplied passage from the Bible. <br />Matthew Scully's book, Dominion explores just how humanity exercises its rule over the earth. In three of the chapters, he exposes the gross excess of Safari Club International, the bribery within the International Whaling Commission, and the Smithfield Corporation's complete disregard for the comfort and well being of their pigs. These serve as examples to support the rest of the book, which dissects theoretical arguments for the topics of animal suffering and rights. Scully considers theories and theorists on both sides of the issue, ranging from Steven Budiansky's \\"secular absolution\\" for cruelty all the way to Peter Singer's Animal Liberation. So many points are offered that this book deserves a second reading to take in all the information presented. <br />But, Scully points out, ultimately theories are only relevant in theory. What truly matters is kindness and mercy in action. The whole book aims to reform our attitudes towards animals, but the last chapter plainly urges lifestyle changes and offers sensible suggestions to help end their misery. Both practical and philosophical, Dominion is wonderful for anyone trying to further develop their own views. I would also recommend it for those kind-hearted meat-eaters who love their dogs and want to save the whales but are unsure about extending that compassion to the rest of the animal kingdom. <br />Matthew Scully's fascinating book reminds us that the command beginning with \\"rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth...\\" doesn't conclude \\"...with an iron fist.\\" --Reviewed by Rachel Crowley	2003-08-18

Most animal rights activists look down upon the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and the destruction of property that some of their rescue missions entail. Animal rights activists are one of the most peaceful group of people in the world, so why are some of them smashing and burning things? The book Free the Animals, by Ingrid Newkirk (co-founder of PETA), not only explains exactly how people can do this, but it also shows the American Animal Liberation Front through the eyes of the people who started it. <br />Told like a fictional story, this book takes you through the life of the womyn who started it all. Starting out as a cop and ending her career to devote her life to animals, this womyn changed the animal rights movement for America. Each chapter is another section of her life, and another raid she went on. <br />Newkirk gives a personal touch to the movement through this womyn, and also through the animals. A story and pictures of each animal she rescues are in the book. You honestly get to live the life of an ALF activist. Depicting everything from stake-outs to the rescues themselves, this book has everything you need to form an accurate opinion about the Animal Liberation Front. <br />Reading this book will definitely enlighten you and change your mind about the animal rights activists who participate in such activities.

Technically this is a children's cookbook, but that's the kind of cookbook I like to use the best. Just because you're all grown up, doesn't mean you have to eat that way. This cookbook is definitely good for beginners though. It's got a great little guide in the front with all the \\"official\\" cooking terms in it so you can understand it all. Like a picture of a spaghetti strainer and next to it, it says \\"colander,\\" so you know what they mean when the instructions say you need a colander. It also tells you exactly what they mean when they ask you to stir, beat, dice julienne, etc. It also breaks down carbohydrates, protein, fats, and vitamins, and tells why you need them. This is definitely a book that you should pick up if you're just starting your vegetarian diet. Although the recipes are mostly vegetarian, there are a few vegan ones in there also. Each recipe is in metric (European) and Imperial (American) measurements. And most recipes give you little alternatives and variations that you can try. In the beginning of each chapter they have about three meal plans that you can try out like a movie night at home, southern meal or a good winter lunch. All of these recipes are fun, easy and taste great. There's everything from full meals to basic vegetables to snacks, shakes and desserts.

Despite the title, this isn't a one hundred percent raw cookbook. As the subtitle announces, it's actually includes recipes for \\"groundbreaking natural cuisine that combines the techniques of macrobiotic, vegan, allergy-free, and raw food disciplines.\\" <br />That said, it's one heck of a cook (and uncook-) book! If you are not completely convinced that you want to go raw, or you wish to make the transition gradually, this book offers a combination of terrific recipes for both uncooked salads, soups, and sauces, as well as cooked grains, soy products, and desserts. <br />The author includes information on digestion, nutrients, and food combining. The glossary in the back will help you identify some of the more unusual ingredients, though if you are an accomplished vegan cook, you are probably familiar with most of them.

After spending years having raw/cooked diet swings, he found it in his heart to write this book. It's purpose: to inform others so they don't have to learn things the hard way. <br />The first chapter delves into human anatomy and our \\"natural\\" diet. It takes us through our instincts and physical characteristics that call us to raw foods. Most of the chapters that follow deal specifically with the diet. Some of the headings include: \\"Fat,\\" \\"Protein,\\" \\"Detoxification,\\" \\"Teeth,\\" \\"Sleep,\\" \\"Giving Up Bad Habits,\\" and \\"Digestion.\\" From Chapter 16, \\"Food Combining,\\" Patenaude says, \\"We should be eating one food at a time and never mixing together anything.\\" He continues, \\"With a simple, mainly raw diet, we automatically avoid most bad food combining.\\" He then goes into the properties of certain foods and how they will react when eaten with others. Important tips such as these are extremely valuable to even experts! <br />The closing appendices of the book have daily menu ideas, testimonials, and comments on certain foods. I particularily enjoyed this book because Frederic's voice is felt throughout the entire thing. All of his words show sympathy toward us because he's interested in our well-being.

That may sound strange, but it's not an uncommon phenomenon. Not all families need to cut out all cooked foods to overcome their child's problems, but that's exactly what worked for Cheryl Stoycoff's family. <br />In her introduction, she lets the reader know what not to expect from the book: it isn't a primer on raw nutrition for children. She wrote it for those who are already convinced of the benefits of a raw diet but still need advice on how to help older children make the transition. Much of her advice is based on the simple premise that you first set an example, then you enlist your child's cooperation - as best you can. <br />I like that the author is realistic about the fact that some kids will transition more easily than others. She encourages loving patience and praises the benefits of any change toward a healthier, more whole foods vegan diet, rather than lamenting the difficulty of going 100% raw with kids. And she covers not only dealing with children themselves, but also briefly discussing handling school, relatives, and social gatherings. <br />Also included are chapters on \\"The Diet-Behavior Connection\\" and \\"Meal Ideas\\" complete with a section of her own tried-and-true kid-friendly raw recipes. <br />This is a short book, an easy read, and it answered many of the questions I had when contemplating how one could possibly get a whole family to go raw.

Reading it does something that other more technical raw food manuals and cookbooks cannot do: it allows the reader to actually see what life might be like as a raw fooder.<br />Though the Boutenko's and their children were experiencing health problems due to their diet and lifestyle which strongly influenced their desire to go raw and encouraged them to stick with it, their story offers hope that making the transition with older children is indeed possible.<br />This is an inspiring book, and it includes a small recipe section and some before and after photographs of the family.

The writing style is simple, easy-to-understand, and fun-to-read, making it a sure winner for this age group. However, the book would appeal just as much to parents and younger children. The author and her husband have raised two vegetarian daughters, and her connection with what veg kids want and need to know is clear and strong. She has a knack for presenting facts and information that keeps your attention, and most importantly, will appeal to young minds.<BR><br /><BR>The book starts by defining \\"vegetarianism,\\" and includes quotes from kids of all ages explaining why they decided to become vegetarians. Interspersed throughout the chapters are quotes from famous people and interesting facts about animals, animal agriculture, the environment, and nutrition. Short activities help to illustrate the topic of each section. For example, to help children understand how much space a chicken is allotted in a typical egg-laying factory cage, the author suggests taking a ruler and a sheet of paper and tracing a six-inch square. This is a quick, easy lesson that really brings the point home.<BR><br /><BR>Schwartz goes on to discuss how to deal with parents who aren't happy about having a child convert to vegetarianism and \\"other sticky situations,\\" like talking to one's peers, handling holiday dinners, and getting decent veg food in the school cafeteria. She covers these topics by offering simple advice without sounding preachy. She keeps it upbeat and positive, which kids will appreciate, but which some may find unrealistic. Still, her saucy comebacks are priceless, and will allow veg kids to arm themselves with funny comments whenever they are put on the spot.<BR><br /><BR>In the chapter \\"Food, Glorious Food!\\" Schwartz presents a history of vegetarianism and a primer on \\"new\\" foods, many of which are not eaten regularly within the standard American diet. She introduces soy foods including soymilk, tofu, TVP, tempeh, and miso, and includes information on lentils and quinoa, plus peanuts, chickpeas, and potatoes, all of which have interesting stories behind them. She even briefly discusses genetically modified foods.<BR><br /><BR>Finally, after providing a general discussion of eating a balanced diet in the chapter entitled \\"Be Smart - Stay Healthy,\\" Schwartz goes on to discuss nutrition in more detail. This section is so easy to comprehend that my 5-year-old enjoyed reading it with me. Provided are sample lacto-ovo and vegan diet menus, lots of meal ideas, and a handful of recipes to get you started. This title is highly recommended for new vegetarian kids as well as their meat-eating or vegetarian parents. It would also work well for vegetarian parents who want to teach their children aged 5 to teen about nutrition.	2003-05-27

Though she seems to be promoting attachment parenting, the author is very adamant about a baby's \\"need\\" to cry. She does recommend that you hold the infant while he's crying, but she is against breastfeeding for comfort, which I don't agree with. She talks about letting the baby cry instead of nursing so he won't get into a \\"control\\" pattern. I'm sorry, but a 3 month old baby just needs comfort. Furthermore, her references are very sketchy, especially when it comes to her personal theories, which she presents in the same way that she presents the factual information.

She defines a food \\"allergy\\" as the following experience: \\"eating a food causes you distress, or if you discover any clear cause-and-effect symptoms that are relieved by avoidance of specific foods.\\"<br />Her completely updated and revised cookbook includes over 350 recipes. Each is free of all common food allergens. No more getting halfway through a recipe only to realize that it would have been gluten-free if only you had used the other flour option. There are also chapters on ingredients that may be new to you, rotary diversified diets, keeping your home allergy-free, eating out, and helping children with allergies.<br />Note that this is not a vegetarian cookbook. However, a majority of the recipes are vegan. There are 17 vegetarian main dishes, and several of these have become instant hits at my house. The Better Burgers are the greatest.  For Thanksgiving, I served the Zesty Loaf for the first time and an hour later, the loaf was gone, and my sisters-in-law were begging for the recipe.<br />We have also grown quite fond of the Fresh Apple Muffins. They will be going with us to our La Leche League meeting this month. And I'm willing to bet that none of them will be making the return trip home.<br />The only recipe that hasn't turned out well was the Date Pecan Pie. Too much blackstrap molasses makes things taste like cough syrup.<br />My only complaint with the book is that quite a few of the baked goods call for white buckwheat flour or a combination of flours. While the author explains how to grind whole buckwheat groats in the blender, I find that to be too time consuming. With a preschooler and baby around, I don't have time to grind my own flour. I have the same issue with the combination of flours used in some recipes. It takes extra time to get out and measure three different flours. <br />However, as one who eats a vegan diet in the comfort of my own home, I have to say that I love allergy-free cookbooks: no dairy, no eggs, and all-natural sugars. As a fine example of a cookbook that fits this bill, The Allergy Self-Help Cookbook will always have a place in my kitchen.<BR>--Reviewed by Virginia Delaney	2003-01-02

I have to admit I was a little disappointed when I first looked at this book.  But as all too often happens, we adults fail to see the true joy in something simple.  The pictures of a child doing yoga instantly entranced my son, and the hand drawn backgrounds lend a sense of playfulness.  My son who is four has been mimicking my yoga poses since he was around 10 months old, but this is the first time he has seen someone his own size in these poses.<br />I found he lacked the patience to listen to the descriptions that accompany the pictures, but would talk about the pictures, ask questions, and willingly try the poses himself, often holding a pose for 30 or more seconds.  Anyone with a 4-year-old knows that 30 seconds is an eternity.  My 19-month-old daughter wasn't interested in the book but enjoyed copying her brother.<br />My son has been asking to practice with me more often lately, bringing his own mat when he sees me setting up for my practice.  He asks for his favorite poses by name or by finding them in the book.  <br />This book has also deepened by own yoga practice.  My children have reminded me that yoga does not have to be so serious.  It is okay to giggle about tipping over during tree pose or to stop for a quick hug after triangle pose.  I had forgotten these simple things as I worried about getting my poses just right.<br />This book lacks this warning, but remember to let the child lead you.  While I expect an hour or more of myself, I have found my son seems to lose interest after 15 or 20 minutes - but that is fine.  Instead, I will continue to cherish the time he practices with me but I also get a little more time when he curls up and goes to sleep beside me on his mat while I finish my practice each night.<BR>--Reviewed by Teresa Burgess	2003-01-02

(Katzen also has nice introductions and incidental notes within the articles that make them fun to read.) Many recipes include variations that make the book full of possible recipes and combinations. I especially liked the two introductory chapters about breakfast: \\"Make Room in your Life for Breakfast,\\" which includes a short look at breakfast around the world, and \\"Breakfast for Metabolic Health,\\" which discusses how breakfast contributes to our overall diet. The book contains over 300 recipes with sections on breakfast beverages, \\"Vegetables for Breakfast\\" and a delicious-looking chapter on \\"Potatoes, Beans, Tempeh & Hashes.\\" Katzen states that most of the recipes take less than 30 minutes to prepare, and many take less than fifteen. <br />Unfortunately, there is no nutritional information with the recipes, and only 3 1/2 pages on menu planning at the back of the book. Sunlight Café is also obviously designed for lacto-ovo vegetarians as it relies heavily on dairy and eggs, and many recipes are not suitable for vegan substitutions, although Katzen says you can always substitute soy milk for cow's milk. While there are vegan recipes in the book, they're not labeled, so vegans get the not unpleasant chore of wandering through the chapters soaking in all the interesting tidbits while picking out what recipes to prepare.<BR>--Reviewed by Amy O'Neill Houck	2003-01-02

This view has made it easy for some to cruelly treat, kill and eat them. Patterson describes how slaves were treated similarly to domestic animals.<br />By designating some people as animals during the Nazi holocaust, humans were able to persecute, exploit and violently deal with their own species.  Patterson states that referring to humans as animals \\"...is always an ominous sign because it sets them up for humiliation, exploitation, and murder,\\" and he cites numerous examples of races referred to as animals during times when they were exploited, treated brutally, killed and even exterminated.<br />Patterson then turns his attention to large scale violence against both nonhuman and human animals in both the United States and Germany. Some of this violence was due to the American eugenics movement, which, according to Patterson, was in part inspired by the breeding of domesticated, nonhuman animals, and the creation of assembly-line slaughter in America which later \\"...crossed the Atlantic Ocean and found fertile soil in Nazi Germany.\\" <br />In 1939 the eugenics movement in Germany included killing mentally challenged people and those with emotional and physical disabilities. Many of the people instrumental in these mass murders came from a background in animal agriculture. According to Patterson, the eugenics movement, sterilization and murders combined with the mass industrialized slaughter of nonhuman animals led to the Nazi \\"Final Solution.\\"<br />Patterson points out that the Nazis treated their victims like animals before murdering them.. Dehumanizing the victims made it easier to murder them.<br />By looking at how humans have treated nonhuman animals and other humans seen as inferior, Patterson effectively illustrates how the Holocaust occurred and how similar atrocities occur every day in slaughterhouses and factory farms. <br />The final part of the book looks at Jewish and German people whose advocacy on behalf of nonhuman animals was influenced by the Nazi Holocaust. In order to create a kinder, more compassionate world, our species must make peace with the nonhuman animals with whom we share the earth and give them the respect that they deserve. <br />Every so often a book is written that has the potential to make an incredible difference. Eternal Treblinka is one such book. <BR>--Reviewed by N. Glenn Perrett	2003-01-02

Did I really want to know if our home was toxic? Did I want to know if my son's school was a safe place for him to be? I wasn't sure at first, but as is typical for me and other moms I know, my parental guilt got the best of me and I sat down to read this amazingly interesting book.<br />The environmental checklist at the back of the book proved to be more than just another thing to do; it helped me to focus in on areas of our home where we are at risk of being exposed to toxins.  <br />Did you know, for example, that magic markers that contain xylene can cause your child to experience headaches, dizziness, confusion, and balance and breathing problems? Scented markers can be dangerous in addition because they encourage children to taste them.<br />The book does contain some good news.  For example, olive oil can be effective in treating head lice, therefore avoiding the potential dangers of the more caustic over-the-counter head lice treatments.<br />Forget about creating a germ free kitchen or bathroom - it can't be done.  Using antibacterial, germ killing, sterilizing sprays will rarely result in a germ free environment, even if that were something one would wish to do.  Using toxic cleaners simply replaces the germs with a synthetic chemical hazard.  Overuse of such products can actually increase the potency of germs that can rise up and revolt against the products themselves.  For disinfecting, simple \\"green\\" products work and are safe, or a homemade solution of ¼ cup of bleach to a gallon of water will suffice.  <br />I was further surprised to learn that commercial peanut butter might be better for your child than the ground peanut version.  This is largely because there are government regulations limiting the amount of aflatoxin, a naturally occurring toxin producedby mold that contaminates peanuts.  A child who eats a product with high levels of aflatoxin may develop liver failure.  Some fresh ground peanut butters tested at natural food stores were found to have levels higher than the government standards of this dangerous substance.  <br />Raising Healthy Children in a Toxic World has now joined the other reference books that sit on my kitchen counter for a quick thumb through when needed.  I recommend other parents add it to their bookshelves as well.<br />--Reviewed by Carol LaLiberte	2003-01-02

That's what, I believe, Jay Disney is hoping to achieve in his cookbook, The Middle Path, a book written to appeal to vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.  Disney provides a realistic and sophisticated approach to vegetarianism without being aggressive.<br />Disney discusses the various reasons for eating a vegetarian diet without offending the meat eating set and without getting on the cruelty-free soapbox.  The only soapbox he stands upon is the one dedicated to \\"moderation.\\"  While he does make mention of the far-reaching benefits of a vegetarian diet, he does it in a matter of fact way that speaks to why people do it as opposed to why all people should do it.<br />In The Middle Path Cookbook, Disney supplies a book full of information on techniques and ingredients.  Each chapter includes an educational introduction giving descriptions of the focus ingredients and cooking tips.  For many cooks this may be old news.  However, those less experienced cooks will find this information and instruction takes away the intimidation factor in most of the more sophisticated recipes.<br />Disney's recipes range from basic to sophisticated, healthy to decadent, with everything in between.  Although Disney uses eggs and dairy in several of the recipes, he does offer up some advice on substitutions.  Still, there are a number of recipes using heavy cream, butter, and sour cream without mentioning whether or not non-dairy substitutes would work in those instances. Many of his recipes are \\"transitional\\" in nature, but he still manages to include recipes utilizing tempeh and seitan for the more experienced vegetarian.<br />Overall,   The recipes are creative and tasty, especially the vegan ones. <BR>--Review by Lucy Watkins	2003-01-02

She and others like her had grown weary of treating their children's ailments with risky traditional medicine.  These \\"medicine moms\\" discovered that ages old homeopathy really did work for their kids and began to research it, learning more about its application. While the author states clearly in the book that a certified homeopath should always be consulted in the uses of homeopathic remedies, in this book she explains clearly and in lay people's terms why homeopathy works, how it works and for whom it works.  I learned more from reading this book than from going to a homeopath for the past two years.  I now understand many of the remedies he suggested for me for various conditions, just based on what I read in Medicine Moms.

Mothers in search of information about and support for nursing founded what is today an international organization dedicated to breastfeeding.  \\"Medicine Moms\\" is a term used by the author for mothers wanting a better course of action for their kids than traditional medicine.  Through their own research and support, they began to share what they knew about homeopathy and watched in amazement as their kids responded to homeopathic remedies for various ailments, without the side effects of prescription drugs.

The vegetarian would live in harmony with nature.  The carnivores would be constantly at war. In Herb, The Vegetarian Dragon, author Jules Bass instead presents a tale of acceptance, difference and compromise.  Herb, as the title foretells, is a vegetarian dragon.  The other dragons in the forest of Nogard are meat-eaters.  The King and his brave knights at Castle Dark are also meat eaters.  In fact, one major complaint the human carnivores have about the dragon carnivores (in addition to the dragon leader's penchant for \\"the sweet taste of royal princesses\\") is that they eat the finest wild boar meat. Through the intervention of a little girl who has befriended Herb, the story is resolved with all parties free to eat what they choose, as long as they stop eating each other.  So, despite the characterization of meat eaters as violent warmongers, the resolution is not strictly pro-vegetarian but rather pro-choice. Debbie Harter's illustrations are exquisite.  Rich and colorful, full of small detail as well as huge characters, the pictures allow the book to reach that perfect combination of engrossing story and mesmerizing visuals.  For the vegetarian child, Herb, The Vegetarian Dragon has the added benefit of presenting a happy character who is different because of what he eats.  Herb is a wonderful role model. --Reviewed by Jake Aryeh Marcus	2002-10-26

When it comes to the other species with whom we share this planet, humans are often ignorant and lacking compassion. This characterization is also one that humans have tried to place on turkeys. Frequently this remarkable animal is wrongly portrayed as stupid and clumsy. Part of the reason for these incorrect descriptions of the turkey has to do with our species having cruelly bred this animal for fast growth and unnaturally large size. Turkeys' dependence on humans is often cited when people state that these birds are not intelligent. However, Karen Davis points out in her book More Than a Meal: The Turkey in History, Myth, Ritual, and Reality that these animals are dependent on humans for survival because we have made them so. By breeding fast growing, overweight turkeys we have created birds who are unable to walk fast or fly into trees and who commonly experience \\"lameness, respiratory congestion, mating infirmities, and heart disease, and most have white feathers that prevent them from camouflaging themselves.\\" Besides intelligence, Davis offers fine examples to illustrate that turkeys are good parents and very protective of their young. <BR>If human animals are going to begin respecting and living in harmony with nonhuman animals, we must learn about these animals and treat them with the compassion and respect all species deserve. We must also learn from our mistakes and cruel past and start righting these wrongs. In More Than a Meal: The Turkey in History, Myth, Ritual, and Reality, Karen Davis provides considerable knowledge on these fascinating animals and our deplorable relationship with them.--Reviewed by N.

Hooray!  This is the cookbook for which I have been waiting.  In fact, if you are vegetarian or vegan, you have very likely been waiting for it, too.  It truly has wide appeal.  Whether you are a veggie teen, an active and over-committed adult, or a senior citizen wanting to keep it simple (as in easy), you will enjoy and value Nava Atlas' book as much as I do.  There is so much I love about it, and only two things I would change; but they are teensy-weensy criticisms.  First, about the recipes:  true to her word, Ms. Atlas has somehow managed to create 250 recipes, each with five or less ingredients.  You will find familiar stand-bys, as well as new and imaginative dishes.  Looking for a hummus recipe?  It's in there.  How about veggie pizza?  It's in there, too (twelve pages of pizza recipes-delicioso!)  Do you enjoy a comforting, nourishing soup?  Yep; you will find that, too, in \\"Chapter 1: Simplicity in a Soup Pot.\\" What about tofu?  I have been eating tofu regularly for nearly ten years now.  You can imagine that my favorite tofu recipes no longer create much excitement at the dining table.  Therefore, I am always on the lookout for an addition to my tofu repertoire.  Was I ever excited to find an entire chapter (\\"Chapter 5: Essential Soy\\") devoted solely to tofu recipes! That's where I headed first. <BR>There is so much more to The Vegetarian 5-Ingredient Gourmet than recipes.  If your mantra is, \\"I don't have [pick one or more]  a) the time,  b) the inclination, c) the know-how to successfully prepare a vegetarian or vegan meal,\\" have no fear.   Ms. Atlas has done all the thinking and the work (except the cooking, of course), including a complete shopping list for stocking your cupboards, menu suggestions for each and every recipe, a menu-planning guide, and nutritional statistics.  There are even shopping list and planning forms that you may reproduce over and over again. My absolutely favorite thing about this book is that every chapter-indeed, nearly every page-includes interesting and fascinating information about the various recipe ingredients.  Ms. Atlas has also provided numerous helpful hints regarding preparation. Remember the two teensy-weensy criticisms I had about The Vegetarian 5-Ingredient Gourmet?  One is that it has no color inside.  I think it deserves more pizzazz than shades of gray.  The other is that it is not in hardcover, and I fear this treasure of a cookbook will wear out long before I am ready.  ...	2002-08-19

While it isn't difficult for vegans to modify most vegetarian recipes, it is nice not to have to. A quality vegan recipe book is important for those of us who don't use products from animals and who want diversity in our meals. Rose Elliot dispels many of the myths commonly associated with vegetarian and vegan diets. At the beginning of her book, Elliot deals with misconceptions that much of society has concerning protein, iron, calcium and vitamin B12. After putting the reader's mind to rest concerning these items, Elliot briefly states some of the benefits of vegetarian and vegan diets. The book has a variety of nutritious recipes in the following sections: Soups; Dips; Sandwiches and Bread-based Snacks; Salads, Dressings and Appetizers; Sauces; Pastry Dishes; Pasta Dishes; Legume Dishes; Grain and Nut Dishes; Potato Dishes; Desserts; and Scones, Cakes and Cookies.<BR>As with her book Vegetarian Christmas, Elliot's recipes are easy to prepare and sound delicious. Each recipe includes the number of servings it makes and many recipes include variations. A few of the recipes that I'm looking forward to trying are: Lentil Loaf, Stuffed Nut Roast, Instant Vegan Raspberry Ice, Christmas (plum) Pudding, Spring Rolls with Dipping Sauce, and Bread Sauce.<BR>Vegan Feasts is an excellent recipe book that will be a significant addition to any vegetarian's or vegan's cookbook library! -Reviewed by N.

So your know-it-all cousin chides that your baby's being spoiled by all that attention.  Last time you talked, she disapproved of prolonged breastfeeding. What'll it be next?  Don't you wish you had some scientific evidence to back up your choices?  Well, now you do.  Dr. Linda Folden Palmer's book, Baby Matters,  exhaustively lists the scientific evidence behind attachment parenting, breastfeeding, and the reality of food allergies.  With chapters such as, \\"The Attachment Advantage,\\" \\"Bonding: the Inside Story,\\" \\" Crying & Caring,\\" and  \\"The Dangers of Cow's Milk,\\"  Dr. Palmer shows how the establishment of science-conquering-nature has caused unnecessary suffering and heartache to parents and babies alike.  Leaving babies to \\"cry it out,\\" forcing them to sleep alone, giving them formula instead of breastfeeding, ignoring possible food allergies, and indiscriminate vaccination have all resulted in alarming SIDS rates, aggressiveness, emotional detachment and physical illness.  Not to be accused of selectively culling sources, Palmer evenhandedly discusses vaccines, for example, deflating the overblown cons and discussing the details of what the research really shows.  This is truly a valuable resource for attachment parents, and perhaps if you gave it to your cousin at her baby shower, she might just learn a thing or two.  What you (and your great grandma) knew in your heart was right all alongit simply took some time for our society to catch up. Reviewed by Regina Cassidy	2002-08-14

There aren't many books about tofu out there, so even though this isn't a vegetarian title per se, we love it for the positive messages it includes: love of animals and good, healthful food. The story is about Mr. Kim, a Korean immigrant, who finds a cat at the pound when he first comes to America. Everyone says, \\"Oh, you got a new cat!\\" so that is what is what he names her. New Cat is Mr. Kim's best friend, and it is her job to guard his tofu factory. One night a naughty little mouse gets into the production room and nibbles on some electrical wires starting a fire. New Cat saves the day when she goes to investigate and accidentally spills a huge vat full of tofu and water. When Mr. Kim arrives, he is grateful to the firefighters, but his is worried about his missing cat. Knowing he wouldn't be able to sleep with New Cat gone, he stays behind to clean up and finds his scared, wet friend hiding in a vat of tofu! The heartwarming tale is charmingly illustrated by the author, Yangsook Choi, herself a Korean immigrant. She includes a short author's note in the back, describing her memories of buying and eating tofu in her native country. It does include one short mention of meat in this sentence: \\"My mother would always buy some, and the tofu would appear in a hot stew, or a crispy pan-fried meat dish with vegetables...\\" Since my four-year-old won't allow me to skip even one page of a book, I simply leave out the word \\"meat\\" and read on!

Millions of North Americans have turned to vegetarianism and embraced this healthy, compassionate diet, and our numbers are increasing. Unfortunately, we are still a minority, and problems or inconveniences with meat eating family members, relatives, friends, co-workers and others are commonplace. Our ethical diet draws a variety of responses, everything from kidding to anger. Using her own experiences and more than 200 surveys from vegetarians who live with meat eaters, Adams provides good advice on how to deal with the meat eaters in your life. Adams suggests that we consider meat eaters as \\"blocked vegetarians.\\" In the chapter \\"Love at Work III: Living with Meat Eaters - Partners and Children\\" Adams discusses such topics as living with meat eating partners, raising children when only one parent is a vegetarian, raising vegetarian children and cooking with children. To complement the practical advice given to vegetarians, Adams has included more than 70 pages of vegetarian recipes. A section on \\"About Ingredients and Products\\" is also very informative describing items of interest to vegetarians and where and how they can be used. The appendices are also very useful and enhance an already insightful book. Appendix A, \\"Living Among Meat Eaters: Rules of Thumb,\\" provides reminders of important points pertaining to living with meat eaters. Appendix B, \\"Letter to Parents of Vegetarians,\\" contains wise advice for parents whose children have chosen vegetarianism. Appendix C is \\"The Vegetarian Patrons of Restaurants Card.\\" The reader is encouraged to make copies of the card provided which can be filled in and left at restaurants so that the needs of vegetarians visiting the restaurant in the future can be better met. Appendix D is an \\"International Vegetarian Card\\" which says, \\"I am vegetarian. What do you recommend?\\" in 21 languages.

Chase explains about current trends of using animal-derived ingredients like tallow, estrogen, spermaceti, and civet musk in everyday personal care products.  These products involve inhumane treatment of animals - some require the animal to be killed before the ingredient can be harvested.  Instead, Chase suggests some possible man-made or plant-derived alternatives, such as glycerin or jojoba.

Aviva fills the pages with not only commonsense but easy-to-read-and-understand remedies for a wide array of childhood illnesses and complaints. She also includes a lot of information for expecting moms that are healthy, effective words of wisdom. If you are familiar with using herbals and a hands-on approach to illness, then this book is a refreshing compilation of information that will result in you nodding your head in agreement. It is also wonderful to have all the different illnesses and remedies in one place. No more searching for that stray note or book with one quick blurb about a possible remedy for this or that. If, on the other hand, you are not familiar with using anything but a regular doctor or over-the-counter medicine for every illness, this book will be comforting for you as well. It is not an anti-doctor approach at all; in fact there are certain areas in which Aviva mentions that using a doctor is necessary. However, she also includes things that the parent can  do to accompany the doctor's techniques. Everything in this entire book is very empowering to parents and women who are expecting. Often, the first thing we are told to turn to is an over-the-counter med or a quick trip to the doctor's office, and we are left feeling helpless to comfort our children. Aviva stresses how important and powerful the mere touch of a parent is in the healing of a child, and she supports the idea that there is emotional healing to be done as well as physical healing for any illness. The herb list is extensive and there are many easy-to-follow directions for tonics, teas, washes and other healing ideas that can be made at home, even by a sleep-deprived parent. The remedies do not involve a lot of searching for hard-to-find ingredients or supplies. Each remedy is simple and starts with a non-invasive approach. I recommend this book for any expecting couple, new or experienced parent. You will find yourself turning to it again and again . <BR>-Reviewed by Amy Rawson	2002-05-20

People who have obtained their opinions from the Bible have told me such things as, \\"Animals were put on the earth for humans to use,\\" or \\"Animal don't have souls, and they don't go to heaven.\\" It is refreshing to read Reverend J. R. Hyland's positive, well-researched book about God's love, respect and concern for animals and how they should be treated. Reverend Hyland sheds light on such atrocities as animal sacrifices and animal slaughter and how God did not want these sacrifices and meant for all animals, both nonhuman and human, to be vegetarians. He claims that carnivorous eating is in direct contradiction to the Bible. \\"God said unto them...have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, `Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.' (Gen. 1:28-29) \\"The restriction to a vegetarian diet as the only legitimate form of food was the standard to which all of earth's creatures had been held from the beginning of time. But during the millennia that had passed since then, human beings had become conditioned-and adapted-to a much lower form of life. Noah and his family, like the people among whom they lived, had become carnivorous.\\" Reverend Hyland also shows how humans have altered the meaning of parts of the Bible. For example, he explains that \\"the Book of Genesis plainly states that animals, like humans, were created as nefesh chaya: living souls. (Gen. 1:21,30) Scholars have obscured this fact by translating the same words differently. When applied to Adam, nefesh chaya reads \\"living soul.\\" (Gen. 2:7) But when the same term is used about animals it is translated as \\"living creature.\\" (Gen. 2:19) He goes on to explain that even though there is no biblical basis for their belief many people use the excuse that animals do not have souls to condone \\"the most sadistic and cruel treatment of sentient beings.\\" This is an informative book illustrating that nonhuman animals are not to be exploited, abused, and killed, but treated with respect, compassion, and kindness. Hopefully, our species will heed Reverend Ryland's wise and humane warnings-and soon! <BR>-Reviewed by N. Glenn Perrett	2002-05-20

The Man Who Planted Trees is the tale of Elzeard Bouffier, a man who, after his son and wife die, spends his life reforesting miles of barren land in southern France. Bouffier's planting of thousands and thousands of trees results in many wondrous things occurring, including water again flowing in brooks that had been dry for many years. The brooks are fed by rains and snows that are conserved by the forest that Bouffier planted. The harsh, barren land is now pleasant and full of life.<br />Written by Jean Giono, this popular story of inspiration and hope was originally published in 1954 in Vogue as \\"The Man Who Planted Hope and Grew Happiness.\\" The story's opening paragraph is as follows:<br />\\"For a human character to reveal truly exceptional qualities, one must have the good fortune to be able to observe its performance over many years. If this performance is devoid of all egoism, if its guiding motive is unparalleled generosity, if it is absolutely certain that there is no thought of recompense and that, in addition, it has left its visible mark upon the earth, then there can be no mistake.\\" <br />The Man Who Planted Trees has left a \\"visible mark upon the earth\\" having been translated into several languages. In the \\"Afterword\\" of the Chelsea Green Publishing Company's edition, Norma L. Goodrich wrote that Giono donated his story. According to Goodrich, \\"Giono believed he left his mark on earth when he wrote Elzeard Bouffier's story because he gave it away for the good of others, heedless of payment: `It was one of my stories of which I am the proudest. It does not bring me in one single penny and that is why it has accomplished what it was written for.'\\"<br />This special edition is very informative. Not only does it contain Giono's inspirational story, which is complemented beautifully by Michael McCurdy's wood engraving illustrations and Goodrich's informative \\"Afterword\\" about Giono, but it also contains considerable information about how wood and paper canbe conserved in the section \\"The WoodWise Consumer.\\" Goodrich writes about Giono's effort to have people respect trees.<br />\\"Giono later wrote an American admirer of the tale that his purpose in creating Bouffier `was to make people love the tree, or more precisely, to make them love planting trees.' Within a few years the story of Elzeard Bouffier swept around the world and was translated into at least a dozen languages. It has long since inspired reforestation efforts, worldwide.\\" <br />The Man Who Planted Trees is not only a wonderful story, it will inspire you and your children to care for the natural world.<br />-Reviewed by N.

Considerable information is also provided on such topics as calcium, calcium supplements, vitamin D, milk substitutes, dining out and travel tips, to name a few. <br />While reading the section on vitamin D, I was hit once again with the realization that being truly vegan can be very difficult - and not because it is hard to eliminate meat, dairy and other animal products from our diet. That was easy. Learning to understand labels can be much more difficult - especially when important information is missing. For example, under the section \\"Does the vitamin D added to foods come from animals\\" I learned that vitamin D2 comes from plants while D3 comes from animals.  <br />\\"There are two forms of dietary vitamin D: D2 or ergocalciferol, which is of plant origin, and D3 or cholecalciferol, which comes mainly from sheep's wool and hides, fish liver, and eels. Unfortunately, most of the vitamin D added to foods is vitamin D3. The main exception is nondairy milk - many of these products contain vitamin D2.\\" (page 40) <BR>Armed with this information I went to the kitchen to see what is in our multi vitamins. Arrghh! Of the three brands of children's vitamins, two listed vitamin D as D3 while the other just listed it as vitamin D and didn't specify whether it was D3 or D2.

We do the easy thing, the quick fix, the instant cure, rather than reading the important signals that will lead the way to better health and greater peace of mind. Consuming a diet based on plants helps the body to become more in tune with nature. Vegans have lower rates of many types of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, strokes, kidney stones, arthritis, and osteoporosis, just to name a few.  They suffer fewer illnesses and have clearer skin.  They are living in truer balance with nature.  Alexander gives the reader a jumping off point by explaining why it is important to eat this way and how to do it.  Many cookbooks give recipes, but no guidance, which can be frustrating for someone who wants to change the way that they eat but has no idea how to begin to change.  I found the recipes to be easy to follow and delicious.  The black and white illustrations by Suzanne Wood are enchanting.  This guide is so much more than a cookbook.  I found the ideas fascinating; it made me want to fulfill my responsibility - to take care of my body to help insure harmony in the universe. -Reviewed by Michelle Smith	2001-11-23

I used to wish that my local fast food restaurants would add a veggie burger to their menu.   I liked the idea of loading my brood into the car and zipping through the drive thru - simple, quick, and heck, a meal even came with a toy.  I would think, &quot;Man! If only they had a veggie burger!&quot;  Now, I realize that the issue is much more complicated than that.   <br />In reading this book, I learned about the way that the fast food industry exploits consumers and even the very people who help to make the business a success - the workers in the restaurants and the meat packers.  It's a very complex issue.  Some of this exploitation takes place because a large proportion of the workers are young, unskilled, and/or poor - from the kid behind the counter, all the way to the meat cutter who takes a chance on his life every day by simply performing his job.  Quotas, not people, are what are important in an industry that appears to focus solely on the all-mighty buck.   <br />I may not eat this food, but my friends and family do.  It's chilling to read statements such as, &quot;A great deal of effort was spent denying the federal government any authority to recall contaminated meat or impose civil fines on firms that knowingly ship contaminated product. Under current law, the USDA cannot demand a recall.&quot;   Or, &quot;In the eight years since the Jack in the Box outbreak, approximately half a million Americans, the majority of them children, have been made ill by E. coli 0157:H7. Thousands have been hospitalized, and hundreds have died.&quot; <br />When I started reading Fast Food Nation, I expected it to be dry and uninteresting.  It's not.  Eric Schlosser, who spent three years on research, takes the subject of fast food and demonstrates how it applies to many different aspects of everyday life.  I found it to be interesting and moving.  I quoted it constantly to anyone and everyone who would listen.  I suggest you read this book and pass it on to as many people as you possibly can. -Reviewed by Michelle Smith	2001-11-01

Unfortunately, this compassionate attitude isn&#8217;t always extended to wild animals or those that much of society callously regards as &#8220;food animals.&#8221; Many usually caring and thoughtful children (and some adults) don&#8217;t think (or don&#8217;t want to think) about where their burger or bacon & eggs come from. Some people mistakenly think, or are wrongly led to believe, that animals raised for society&#8217;s unhealthy and cruel diet live carefree, enjoyable lives free from any hardships until they are quickly and humanely killed for food. <BR>Saving Emily is a wonderful novel for children aged 9 and up. In telling the stories of Emily, the heifer, 12-year-old Chris, and his friend Gina,Nicholas Read not only provides an interesting and enjoyable story, he also effectively informs the reader of the cruel existence that cows and bulls must endure until they are killed. <BR>While Saving Emily is an interesting story and provides valuable insight into the business of growing and killing animals for food, it also deals with the important and common issues of dealing with&#8212;and overcoming, difficult childhood experiences. Chris must leave his friends and school in the city. His parents are divorced and his mother has married someone who lives in a small town. Gina is different from the other children in her school. She is a vegetarian and she helps out at the Rescue Ranch where dogs, horses and cows who have been saved are cared for. Her love for&#8212;and attitude toward, animals doesn&#8217;t sit well with the other students in the ranching community. <BR>Finally, Saving Emily conveys the vital message that the efforts of a few can result in positive changes, making an often hostile and cruel world a little kinder. Children who like animals will enjoy this book. Children who aren&#8217;t as caring toward animals should read it! &#8211;Reviewed by Glenn Perrett	2001-10-31

The deer teaches Victor the difference between carnivores and vegetarians, including the difference in their teeth, jaws, claws and fingernails. At the picnic Victor shares the food of animals who do not eat meat. Rabbits share their vegetables, a giraffe offers some of her green leaves, cows share their soybeans, horses give Victor oats, a gorilla provides bananas, chipmunks offer nuts, an elephant shares peanuts, and a few mice hand Victor some of their seeds. <BR>When Victor wakes up he goes home and tells his parents about his dream and that he has learned what he needs to eat. <BR>Victor's Picnic With the Vegetarian Animals not only points out some of the differences between animals who eat meat and animals who consume plants, but also the types of food that vegetarians consume including: vegetables, beans, grains, fruits, nuts and seeds.

His room, a peaceful place during the day, morphs into a house of horrors when the dark night sky heralds the arrival of the boy under the bed. The boy is frightening as he scurries about, keeping Giles from a decent night's sleep. Mother and Father are no help - those tricky boys are very clever and can make themselves invisible, if the need arises. So Giles, determined to regain some peace, as well as some Z's, decides to take matters into his own hands. He recites a song that brings the boy to tears. The boy wants to leave, but can't find his way home. Climbing under the bed, armed with a flashlight, Giles helps the boy to find his way back. After spending a bit of time together, the boy and Giles realize an important universal truth - no matter what a being looks like on the outside, we are all pretty much the same on the inside. Young monsters and young boys both like to play and they both can feel alone and afraid when they are lost in the dark. Full of colorful and imaginative illustrations, this twist on the popular notion of monsters hiding under the bed will appeal to young girls, boys, and monsters everywhere. --Reviewed by Michelle Smith	2001-08-30

This is a recipe book that will not only become dog-eared with use, but you will rave about it again and again to your friends. If you have a meat-eater that you are trying to cook for, this will be the book that brings him or her over to the vegan side of life. To say that this is simply a recipe book would be giving you only half the picture. This book is full of delicious recipes, as well as an amazing amount of cooking and food information. You could actually just sit and read this book. The recipes are rich and fulfilling, and the blends of foods are just different enough to entice you and your family to try new things. I think the single, most important bit of information gleaned from this book was the recipe for tofu cream that had endless variations. It may sound trivial, but often the richness of a dairy product like sour cream really makes a dish, and often, that is the one thing that I miss. This tofu substitute is entirely satisfying, and dare I say, even better because you can transform it to fit the dish.The preconceived notion that all vegan fare leaves you hungry and unsatisfied will be quashed when you try some of the heartier choices like Shepard's Pie and Thai Vegetable Stew, which requires only a simple trip to your local Asian grocery store. For dessert, there are fabulous recipes for Chocolate Mousse Cake, fruit pies and cobblers and Cashew-Cinnamon Ice Cream for starters. The best thing about this book is that the recipes are laid out step-by-step so that you can easily follow them. Also, helpful hints are liberally sprinkled throughout. I recommend this cookbook because it not only has many new and different recipes for the vegan family; it also includes rich, tempting foods that you will love to make.-Reviewed by Amy Rawson	2001-06-24

I have bookshelves lined with many really great vegetarian and vegan cookbooks, all with beautiful photos to go along with the recipes, and wonderful ideas for meal planning. But these cookbooks get taken off of the shelf only when it is time to dust, for two main reasons. The first is that most of the recipes have ingredients that I have either never heard of or I can't find in my local grocery store or even health food market. The second reason is that many of the recipes take a long time to prepare. I always think, while perusing these cookbooks in the bookstore, that I will just make the time somehow so that my family will enjoy these vegetarian delicacies. It never happens. As a busy mom, there are times in my day when I have to pause and think, &quot;Have I eaten today?&quot; I need quick recipes with readily available ingredients. Linda McCartney's book is chock full of both.  The introduction presents vegetarianism in a way I had never considered before. Linda writes that it is anticipated that at the present rate, if people continue to convert from meat-eaters to vegetarians, by 2050 we will all be vegetarians. Also a lifetime of vegetarian eating, which I hope my son will have, results in saving 760 chickens, 5 cows, 20 pigs, 29 sheep, 46 turkeys, 7 rabbits, and over half a ton of fish. The cookbook has a whole section on nutrition, food groups, and topics such as the vegetarian pantry and alternatives to dairy products.  Each recipe comes with a preparation time, so I can plan ahead and decide if I have the amount of  time to make a particular entree. There is also a section of the book entitled, &quot;Quick and Easy Meals,&quot; which is, of course, the part of the cookbook that I turned to right away! The photos of these recipes looked just as pleasing as the ones in the other sections of the book, but the preparation times for these meals were more reasonable, given my time constraints. Each recipe throughout the book also indicates which country it came from and some even have notes from Linda telling the circumstances around which she first tried the recipe. Sometimes her daughters introduced her to them, other times she ate them at friend's homes. The book ends with menu planners for such celebrations as children's parties, Easter, Christmas and Thanksgiving, as well as a midsummer eve's picnic.  My family is particularly fond of the festive loaf that is a sort of vegetarian meat loaf made out of veggie burgers. I have served it to non-vegetarians who liked it so much that they requested the recipe! My husband and son prefer the loaf cold and eat it for leftovers in a sandwich. The baked portobello mushrooms were a great main course served with a side of rice and steamed veggies. I love portobellos but cook them the same way every time. The recipe in Linda McCartney's cookbook was quite different from the way I typically make them; the flavors were unique. Linda also has lots of great creative salad dishes that go beyond the mixed green or mesclun type. My family likes her warm zucchini salad, which is simple to make. I nearly always have the ingredients for this dish in my house. Great finger food recipes for kids include crispy vegetable won tons, oven fries, and unique ideas for homemade pizza. There is a dessert section in the cookbook as well.  Linda McCartney has left behind quite a legacy. Making her favorite foods made me feel like I was being invited into an intimate part of her life, enjoying meals that she once shared with family and friends. Linda has left all of us with a wonderful opportunity to enjoy vegetarian food from around the world. She does it in a way that requires limited effort and time. Although she is gone, her music, her animal activism, and her way of living remain with us in different forms even today. Through her recipes, the work shedid in promoting the merits of a vegetarian diet continue to inspire even those of us who feel at times challenged in a culinary sense! -Reviewed by Carol Laliberte	2001-05-15

That is not to say that it's not worth the money-it will tell you everything you need to know about this essential part of the vegetarian diet.  Many of us have missed the boat on flax.  We have heard about omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, but it's often unclear exactly why we need them, why they are so important.  This book goes into detail on that subject without being boring or difficult to understand.  And it gives you over 80 ways to incorporate flax in your diet, recipes for breakfast, breads, spreads and dips, salads and dressings, soups, entrees, side dishes, and desserts.  Two of the authors, Barb Bloomfield and Judy Brown, are well-known vegetarian authors.  Siegfried Gursche, has a long history as a researcher and developer of flax.  He is also the publisher of alive magazine and alive books and the author of Healing with Herbal Juices.	2001-02-12

If you're looking for inspiration to lead you to a healthier lifestyle, you'll find it in this book, an autobiographical account of Ruth Heidrich's amazing journey from breast cancer and a double mastectomy to radiant health through a  low-fat vegan diet and extensive fitness training. Contrary to medical advice, after her mastectomy, she immediately resumed running and refused treatments of chemotherapy and radiation.  Instead, she chose to work with Dr. John McDougall on in experimental diet program. One of the first changes she noticed after starting a vegan diet was improved race times.  She soon added biking and swimming to her regimen and in four years, she completed her first half marathon.  Ruth's health and fitness level only went up from there to find her today as one the world's most impressive athletes.  She completes an unbelievable four triathlons a year (for a total of over 60 races annually!), was inducted into the  Gold's Gym Hall of Fame and, in 1999 was included in Living Fit Magazine's list of the 10 fittest women in America.  Ruth is in her 60's now, and she's in better shape physically and emotionally than most people half her age. She travels the world today, running races, speaking, and inspiring young and old to take food and fitness seriously.  She is a glowing example of the healing power of the human body when it is treated with the utmost respect.	2001-02-12

I don't know how many times I've been walking down the aisle of my grocery store, noticed a new vegetarian item in the frozen section and thought, &quot;Wow, I've gotta try that!&quot;...only to discover it's got egg whites, or casein (a milk protein), or honey.  Oh well.  I invariably walk away feeling like we vegans get the short end of the stick when it comes to convenience foods.  <br />Enter The Complete Guide to Vegetarian Convenience Foods.  Except for the foods marked with symbols to tell you they contain casein or honey, every item listed is vegan.  They are grouped by food type (soy milk, soups, burgers, etc.) and brand.  My copy is completely marked up with notes of different foods I want to try.  Of course, not all these brands will be found in my local area, but the great thing about this book is that I have the exact information to give my store manager when I request that they carry a particular item from a certain company.<br />All the foods in this book were taste tested, and if they didn't measure up, they didn't make the printing!  So you can feel assured that the foods listed are at least worth a try.  In fact, Gail Davis, the author, includes a symbols for Author's Favorite and Kids Pick.  There is also a symbol noting the fat free items.  But I have to say that I am most appreciative of the fact that no items containing hydrogenated oils (trans fatty acids, known to be quite dangerous to your health) are included in this book.  I personally thanked the author for that.  She has saved me loads of time! <br />Also included is a section on pets, a list of resources, and a list of suppliers complete with addresses and phone numbers.  It's obvious that a tremendous amount of work went into compiling this useful tool, and every vegan family should have one. I wholly believe (pardon the pun) in a diet consisting mainly of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, seeds and legumes.  But who doesn't enjoy a veggieburger or packaged cookie once in a while?  People always ask me about how much time it takes me to read labels on every packaged food I buy.  I tell them that although I do spend a lot of time researching my purchases, when I find a brand I like, I just stick with it.  I don't have to read labels every single time I go shopping.  And with this book, now I hardly have to read them at all!	2001-02-12

Dorothy Dougherty is a Speech/Language Specialist who works with adults and children. She is the co-founder of the Atlantic Behavioral Care - a center developed to aid people with speech difficulties. Dorothy believes that &quot;. . . during the first three years of life, parents help &quot;shape&quot; their baby's brain and set the foundation for their life's learning.&quot; Now, that is both an exciting and terrifying realization for me, personally. My daughter is now 2 , and I sure hope that I haven't already blown it. Dorothy's book explains that communication is made up of three basic parts. The first is Receptive Language; this is when we attach meaning to a particular word. The next part is called Expressive Language which includes word choice, vocal tone, any gestures, and rate of speech. The final part is the actual Speech, the sounds that you create with your mouth to form words. The book is divided up into sections dealing with creating &quot;a language-rich environment,&quot; a list of language milestones, ideas and toys to help increase vocabulary, a sample case story, a glossary, and an extensive list of resources. The book is easy to read, written in simple terms, and in a conversational style. When I read it, I found myself making many notes about activities to try with my daughter and I can't wait to pass the book along to my sister, who has a one-year-old. So many of the suggestions are easy and natural: talk to your baby, follow their cues, don't push, be a good model, no baby talk (okay, I'm not so good at this one) and use the proper pronouns, play song and word games, read to your child, and &quot;praise, praise, praise&quot;, among many others. Most importantly, I have learned that it is important to talk to your child and that the television does not work as well as your &quot;live&quot; interaction. I guess that means it's time to cut back on the Blue's Clues and Teletubbie videos.	2000-11-22

I know that I will read it again and again and pass it around to all my Mommy friends. Basically it's all about giving yourself a break and realizing that you do NOT need to be perfect to be a good mom. Perfect is an impossible notion. Good enough is good enough. Amen. Guilt is such a large part of being a parent - not being enough, not doing enough, not making enough, not having enough time, and on and on. Guilt is an unnecessary and debilitating emotion. It breeds a lack of confidence and it kills joy - two really necessary emotions for successful mommying. Ariel Gore, the author of the book is a single mom, as well as the founder and editor of Hip Mama - a `zine for women ([...] She believes that conventional advice books are \\"scary\\", and she shares her story in short essay form. There are essays about her dreams, her pregnancy, her bouts of depression, her battles with the &quot;system&quot; and family court, as well as her breakthroughs and personal insights. Make time for yourself (if you are unfulfilled or empty inside, you will not have anything to share with your children), throw out the concept of having it all (it's a myth and a dangerous goal to attempt to attain), be an individual (your kids will love you for it, even if you do embarrass them), and spend &quot;no more than an hour a day on housework.&quot; I see this book as a sort of literary high-five to women everywhere. Believe in yourself and your mommying skills. Stand up for yourself. Love yourself and love your children	2000-11-22

I've always loved the idea of using yoga for better health and balance.  I can remember sitting beside my mother in a lotus position, making a funny face with my eyes wide open and my tongue hanging out - I think the position was called &quot;The Lion.&quot;  I can also remember the speed with which my mother shed her pregnancy weight after the birth of my little brother when I was 12.  Yoga is a powerful thing - it can soothe your spirit, quiet your mind, or it can set your heart to pumping. DeAnsin Goodson Parker, Ph.D., also believes that it can strengthen your bond with your baby.  Using a concept that she calls &quot;baby whispering,&quot; she teaches parents how to get in tune with the rhythms and the needs of their children - &quot;connecting spirit to spirit.&quot; What a beautiful idea. I tried it with my youngest child, Sarah, who, at the age of two, is really no longer a baby.  She thought that I was trying to tickle her.  I skipped to the back of the book and had more success with the exercises recommended for &quot;mobile babies.&quot;  My son Max is nine, but he has a brain disorder that puts him at the developmental age of a much younger child. He loved the yoga. I laid beside him, matching my breathing to his, and I felt such peace. I can't wait to take the book in to share with his teacher when he returns to school in a couple of weeks. I wish that I had been able to access this book when each of my children were first born. Like the infant massage that I still use, I believe that it provides another way of showing that incredible love that we feel for our children. It encourages trust, and trust in turn builds confidence. It is a truly wonderful book.  -Reviewed by Michelle Smith	2000-10-13

There are those parents who buy bulk foods at the health food store and thoughtfully plan a variety of nutritious meals for their vegetarian children every day.  Then there is me, who considers herself a candidate for mother of the year if she manages to feed her child spaghetti for supper, rather than peanut butter and jelly.  This book helps.  It is filled with nutritious, creative recipes that please adults as well as children.  For the most part, the recipes have simple ingredients and are quick and easy to prepare, although the book does contain some more time-consuming recipes, such as Mama Palma's Pizza, that would be strictly weekend endeavors at my house.  My favorite of the recipes I tried was the Razz-Matazz-Berry Salad.  Mario's Stuffed Shells were a big hit with my husband and 18-month-old son, and my son and I really liked French Toast of the Town (try it with the maple glazed bananas). The book begins with a section called \\"A Healthy Approach to Feeding Our Families,\\" which contains information about food and water safety, basic necessities of a vegetarian kitchen, and food allergies. It also has menu and party planning sections and a helpful section on nutritional requirements and food values.  However, the bulk of the book is recipes, all of which are vegetarian and most of which are vegan (there is honey in a few of the recipes). This book would be a godsend to any parent who needs new ideas for imaginative, nutritious vegetarian meals, when peanut butter and jelly just doesn't cut it anymore. -Reviewed by Susannah Ruis	2000-10-13

Here is a wonderful book of recipes that are not only delicious but provide a natural boost to your immune system and overall good health. The book highlights such fantastic herbalists as Rosemary Gladstar, Christopher Hobbs and Amanda McQuade-Crawford to name but a few. Each herbalist is asked to describe his or her favorite recipes for healing and supporting a healthy body.  With names like Amanda's Herbal Iron Elixir and Balsamic Blast, there is a multitude of choices available for every taste and need. Not only do the recipes cover the healing aspect of herbs in foods, they also include recipes for healing herbs in teas and tinctures. A precise and easy to follow chapter on how to make tincture, teas and cordials makes this a book that can be used by the beginner as well as someone familiar with using medicinal herbs. Another chapter is devoted solely to the herbs in the book, including their common and botanical Latin names, the parts used, the general taste and the herb's affinity for particular body systems. This chapter is especially important for you to familiarize yourself with an herb's properties before using. Finally, there is a wonderful resource section that includes contact information for herbs and natural products, bulk herbs, educational resources and much more. This is a good indication of a book's serious intent and solid background of subject material. There are three chicken soup recipes that include organic, free range chickens and one that includes oysters and two more that include butter and honey. Other than that, all of the recipes are vegan and there are 101 recipes in the book to choose from!	2000-10-13

It used to be  that the mere word \\"sauce\\" gave me pause, conjuring up images of corn  starch, heavy, rich ingredients, and standing in front of a hot stove  stirring.  Erase those images from your mind and imagine a whole book of  entirely vegan sauce and dressing recipes that you can make in a blender.   That means no cooking and literally seconds to a better meal.  A few  recipes do call for toasted nuts or roasted garlic, but those can easily be  done ahead of time, and believe me, that simple extra step is well worth  it. The vast majority of recipes simply call for dumping everything into  the blender and flipping the switch. With the help of this book I turned  out a dinner of pasta with Walnut Pesto and green salad with  Sweet Basil  Vinaigrette in under 30 minutes.  Even my omnivorous guests wholeheartedly  approved. Included are sections on planning vegetarian meals and combining  and correcting flavors. Recipe chapters are: Vinaigrette Sauces &amp;  Dressings; Nut &amp; seed Based Sauces &amp; Dressings; Tomato, Bean &amp;  Vegetable Based Sauces &amp; Dressings; and Creamy Tofu Sauces &amp;  Dressings.  A bonus with each recipe is a list of suggestions for each  using each sauce; for example, you can use the Green Ecstasy Dressing on  pasta with asparagus and carrots, on shredded daikon radish with Bibb  lettuce or on sliced, ripe tomatoes. This cookbook is my current favorite!	2000-08-18

I honestly didn't think I needed another vegan cookbook, so I was pleasantly surprised when I received Incredibly Delicious from the people at Gentle World.  They make their home together on the big island of  Hawaii, and there live an entirely vegan lifestyle.  Sounds like an exotic  dream, doesn't it?  One of the products of their life and work is this  thorough book, joining the ranks of their other vegan title, The Cookbook  for People Who Love Animals.  Noted author, Michael Klaper, M.D., who wrote  Pregnancy, Children and the Vegan Diet and Vegan Nutrition: Pure and Simple  wrote the introduction for this book.  Most notable is the sheer number of  recipes.  If you ever thought of the vegan diet as limited, think again.   Along with chapters devoted to Breads and Breakfast; Salads and Soups;  Dips, Dressings, Salads, and Gravies; Appetizers and side Dishes; and  Desserts, there is a section entitled Rawsome Recipes.  You guessed it-how  to \\"cook\\" everything raw, from hummus to veggie burgers, even breads and  crackers (using a dehydrator).  This section also includes information on  `veganic' gardening, composting and sprouting.  I liked the surprising  addition of this information, because it allows those who are still  considering a raw foods diet to experiment without having to buy a book  they might end up not needing.  It also presents raw food ideas in a  context that might bring the issue into focus for some people who would  never even pick up a raw foods book or magazine.  There are so many  terrific recipes-interspersed with inspiring quotes-that it would be a good  buy for any type of vegetarian.	2000-06-01

This is the perfect book for older vegetarian kids who want to try their hand in the kitchen.  And its forward by dietitian and author Suzanne Havala is a simple, reassuring guide, especially for non-vegetarian parents who have concerns about their independently vegetarian children or teens.   For more than ten years, the author of Kids Can Cook Vegetarian Recipes,  Dorothy R. Bates, has been hosting Friday afternoon cooking sessions for  the teens from the Farm School near where she lives.  You may have heard  about the Farm, a community in Summertown, TN that is known for raising  healthy vegetarian children.  The recipes are simple, easy to follow, and  there is nothing too out of the ordinary.  The Farm kids used these recipes  to create 3-course meals, and a place setting diagram is included in the  book in case your kids want to host a meal, too (or just learn how to set a  proper table).  And in case you think it takes seasoned young chefs to  recreate such a feat, keep in mind that the author has also used these  recipes to cook with disadvantaged inner-city children in the Farm's \\"Kids  to the Country\\" summer program.	2000-06-01

Ones that will be passed down through the generations.  Ones  that you played with as a kid but may have forgotten or didn't realize were  still around.  Founded in 1989, the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio is the only  independent consumer review of children's products, everything from  literature and audio/video to learning toys, top-rated science products and  big ticket items.  The testers are real \\"families from all walks of life\\"  and the criteria  used to determine a toys suitability for a coveted  listing in this yearly manual include: product design, safety and  interactivity, developmental appropriateness, learning and entertainment  value, and more.  The listings are grouped by age, subject, and also into  special award categories, like the SNAP award, the Special Needs Adaptable  Product Award for those toys that are easily adapted for children with  special needs.  Despite all these groupings and listings, the book is very  easy to navigate and so very useful.	2000-06-01

Step by step  instructions with photos make creating these masterpieces easy even for the  inexperienced in the kitchen.

It's the kind of  cookbook that makes you want to learn to cook, and it deserves an hour set  aside to create these lovely meals.  If you can only reconstruct half the  fabulous presentation, it'll be worth your time!  In reality, most of the  recipes only appear to be time-consuming; they are not. There are only a  handful of recipes that seem to be specifically aimed at pleasing the  preschool set.  The book is meant for children of all ages, including  teens.  The recipes will most definitely appeal to adults and older  children.  I would be willing to bet you could even tempt a devout  meat-eater with some of them.  There is definitely an eggs and dairy  emphasis, so it cannot be categorized as a vegan cookbook.  It would make a  great gift for a friend or family member that wants to know what to cook  for you when you come to visit or as an introduction to vegetarian cooking.	2000-04-21

First published in 1977, this classic vegetarian cookbook still has the same charm and warmth of hand-drawn pictures and handwritten recipes, and now it also has bright color photos interspersed among the familiar pages.   There are 30 new recipes, and many of the old ones have been rewritten,  since, as the author describes, her cooking has become \\"more streamlined in  preparation-and lighter in `weight' while richer in flavor\\" over the years.   The oil content has been pared down and only 15 recipes include eggs.   Tips for \\"dairy reduction or substitutions\\" are included, so this version  will probably appeal more to the vegan set.  Also included:  pantry notes,  recommended tools for the kitchen and a table of conversions.	2000-02-16
