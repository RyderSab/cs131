Ceppi asked us to read closely for the rhetoric of class attributes.  There was much class-identifying-imagery to observe in Harding-Davis' 1860's rendering of the lives of impoverished Welsh miners transported into late-slave-era iron foundries of the American North. Mid-19th-cen feminist literature of this social-reform type is deeply informed by Protestant missionary enthusiasm to transform everyone into clean-living bourgeois church-goers. Thus Harding-Davis uses powerful polarities of dirt for workers, clean for bouregoisie, etc. It's so blunt and obvious that she could be accused of writing soap-opera ... as many of her mid-1800's female-writer colleagues were accused, sometimes justly.  However her scenes of poverty, disease, and death in the mills are so heart-wrenching that her motives are clearly pure. Now that Tillie Olsen has rescued Harding-Davis' wonderful writing from obscurity, she is good to read for knowledge of American feminist writing history, for understanding of American class polarities in the ante-bellum era, and also for a true, scary story of life with the great unwashed.	2004-12-13

Tucker Childs.  Fairly user-friendly in tone.  Seemed like it would be accessible for undergraduates as well.  (There were college seniors in my class and they seemed to comprehend the material.)  Handles all the major contemporary theories.  Since the major theories are numerous, complex, and frequently contradictory, Wardhaugh's thought-provoking end-of-chapter questions are a big help for students trying to sort out their intuitions. Great chapters on pidgins and creoles, diglossia, gender, and speech act theories.  Extensive citation of post-1950 research studies and a charming final chapter in which he smilingly admits that this fascinating, emerging discipline is really all over the map.	2004-03-30

Sanskrit shlokas are immediately followed by Shri Sastri's English translation/comments, making it fully accessible to the non-Sanskriti. This is not a user manual but a massive 3-volume reference work.

Key text for serious &quot;big picture&quot; Jyotishi.  Although this was an early work of Behari's and therefore a bit windy, it remains a reasonably understandable gateway into the ancient Vedic cosmology. Behari writes with pronounced Theosophical-Cosmological bent.  May not be suitable for Vedic literalists.

His profound spiritual insights are unmatched in modern Jyotisha literature.  However, Behari is not for everyone. He is not a literalist.  He treats some Vedic subjects as metaphors. You have to already like the theosophical cosmology to appreciate Behari's genius.  To literalists, Behari can be irritating.  Also, normally, Behari's prosaic Indian English writing style makes for cumbersome reading. However this particular volume is skillfully edited by the eminent American Jyotishi, David Frawley. Excellent section on nakshatra's.  Behari's powerful theosophical cosmology shines through quite readable, uplifting prose.

Nakshatra readings are from the older, lunar component. Westerners accustomed to tropical, solar-only astrology will find nakshatra divisions perhaps a very new concept. (For a historical explanation of the merging of solar & lunar systems in Jyotisha, see Valerie Roebuck \\"The Circle of Stars\\".)<br /><br />Harness' \\"Nakshatras\\" provides a nice way to dip one's baby toe into the rich & complex lunar-house system. It offers about 3 pages of description for each nakshatra.  3 pages turns out to be perfect for beginner-level quick reference without detailed study.<br /><br />Each 3-page description includes David Frawley's definition of the nakshtra's \\"shakti\\" or divine energy, the central stars in its astronomical constellation, ruling planet & ruling deities, animal symbol, and descriptive psychological profile.  (Harness has a PhD in counseling psychology.)  There is a brief but useful section on using nakshatras to establish relationship compatibility, and a note on kuja dosha.  Good index too!(A great rarity in Jyotisha books...) At the end, there is an appendix containing 12 basic rashi profiles, which may be helpful for early beginners.<br /><br />If you are starting from a Western astrological perspective and have never heard of nakshatras, by all means buy this modest volume for your Jyotisha bookshelf. It is approachable and easy to read.<br /><br />Seasoned practitioners of the Vidya may find the descriptive material rather superficial, to the point of sounding vapid. This is definitely not a scholarly text. Considering the complexity of nakshatra lore, it is not even particularly informative.<br /><br />However, there is one advanced feature that experienced Jyotishi may agree re-pays the cost of this book. That is Harness' by-permission copy of B.V. Raman's incredibly convenient nakshatra marriage compatibility chart, listed toward the end of the volume.

I love the big picture.  This 464-page book, I think, offers the popular equivalent of a year-long college humanities class.  (But be prepared for upper-division college vocabulary!)<br />Schlain's controversial but compelling thesis is that in human culture over time, we can see a pattern:  when linear (alphabetic) reading &amp; writing prevail, cultural respect for women diminishes.  &quot;Alphabetic&quot; means linear character script not including pictographs such as hieroglyphics but yes including ideographs such as Chinese characters.  An inverse relationship exists, he claims, between high levels of *alphabetic* literacy and low levels of respect &amp; protection for women, between patriarchal dominance and feminine subjugation.<br />To prove his point, Schlain takes us on a humorous, readable, *erudite but easily understandable*  tour of recorded world civilization.  His thesis may or may not be justifiable.  You be the judge.  But buy this book for the recorded history tour!!<br />Schlain's thesis is radical now but maybe in a few years it will be widely accepted.  I personally was convinced!  Plus, I gained a new teaching perspective.  Recommended for language &amp; humanities teachers especially!  If you assign this book to your college students, tell them to read it with serious English dictionary handy.	2002-04-29

The proper method for learning jyotish is to go whole-hog into the jyotish worldview -- no matter how many years you have invested in tropical thinking!  However, this book may be just what the rishi ordered for the tropical-but-wavering-toward-vedic audience.  If you're a Western astrologer tired of bizarre house cusps, miniscule angles, and the West's great body of fragmented astrological literature, Braha's book may help you take that first step toward jyotish. (You'll be glad you did!) Braha says in the book that because he enjoyed some life-changing readings with tropical astrologer Isabel Hickey in his youth, he believes it worthwhile to preserve some of the western techniques which grounded excellent predictors like her.  Although I doubt that such rare accurate tropical readings justify preserving the tropical system (e.g., Hickey was an extraordinary mystic who could have predicted with tea leaves or raven calls as well!) I nevertheless recommend Braha's text as a clear, compassionate, straightforward, step-by-step manual for learning to re-think your tropical charts in the Vedic style. Written in a pleasant tone which is respectful of learning curve stress, it offers enough examples to introduce jyotish, without overburdening the beginner.	2001-10-23

Rick's writing is pungent &amp; entertaining.  He has a weird sense of humor perfectly suited to his subject! Highly recommended for readers with a working knowledge of Vedic predictive techniques, who want the benefit of Rick's extensive death-timing research. Beware, however, that Rick saw himself as a Tropical/Vedic bridge thinker.  Rick was a formerly accomplished tropical astrologer who was driven to study jyotish out of frustration with failed tropical predictions.  He got much better predictions with jyotish &amp; the sidereal zodiac of course, but he chose to retain tertiary progressions which he said improved his accuracy for predicting death.  In 1994, he thought he still could or should address the tropical audience.  Unfortunately the constant switching between these apples-and-oranges perspectives makes the book fairly cumbersome. Also he used his own private ayanamsha (-5.10 from Lahiri) - so if you want to use his examples in your own research, you'll need to accommodate his ayanamsha.  (Luckily, Goravani Jyotish software v.2.x has a Houck's ayanamsha option programmed in.) When Rick left his body in spring 2001, he said that his books would not be reprinted again after his death - so if you want this book, get it soon.	2001-10-23

Philosophy, it turns out, was &quot;just a job.&quot;  I had *no* idea that Paul Feyerabend once possessed a &quot;world voice&quot; for opera.  It was opera he loved.  About 1/3 of the story is about operas he'd seen worldwide, who sang the roles, his critical opinion of the singing!<br />Also includes his bookish, only-child upbringing; his horribly depressed mother and her suicide in his teens; his adult depressions; his affairs and marriages; and finally, his mature love for the beautiful Graziana, which allowed him some actual truth in this life.  It ends with Graziana's reminder that most of Feyerabend's life was spent in chronic pain, the result of a gunshot to his groin during the Nazi retreat from Russia.  That was the injury which rendered him sexually impotent at 20 - a recurring theme in the story.<br />By the last page, I was in tears.

It provides a level of mental peace that no dogmatic philosophy can offer, while permitting both a wide scientific view and strong emotional perception to co-exist on friendly terms.  Naess takes Pyrrho's &quot;abstaining from final judgement&quot; style of scepticism as his model rather than other know-nothing forms of scepticism because the reserving-final-judgement type allows sanity in the real world, freedom from dogmatic extremism, and a wide-angle philosophical objectivity that Naess finds practically useful in an era of fundamentalism and other ideological tyranny.

Norwegian eco-political philosopher Arne Naess is interviewed by spry young American academic David Rothenberg.<br />Subjects span Arne's entire life consciousness.  In easy-to-read, question-and-answer format, this slim volume tells the lay reader many fascinating personal details.  Rothenberg &amp; Naess discuss -- inter alia -- Arne's rejection of his mother, childhood obsession with tiny things, the financial help from his older wealthy businessman brothers that freed Arne to live a charmed &quot;thinking&quot; life, and Arne's subversive leadership in the WWII Norwegian Resistance.<br />Why are this old Norwegian man's memories so important?  Although many in the USA do not yet know him, Arne Naess is considered the father of &quot;Deep Ecology&quot; - a philosophy of articulate ecological beliefs, which works to shape ecological dialog with non-ecological forces.<br />Today's ecological thinkers will find these interviews highly educational.  It is intriguing to see how the 20th century movement called Deep Ecology was shaped not only by Naess' work in ethics and communication theory, but also by his spiritual communion with non-human intelligence, and his &quot;Panzercharakter&quot; defensive shell.<br />These personal interviews reveal that the spiritually transcendent militancy of Gandhi's &quot;satyagraha&quot; - which Naess has made so key to modern ecological activism - appealed to him emotionally as well as philosophically.  Most importantly they confirm that the emotional life of the leading ecological philosopher of the 20th century, has been equally as influential as his intellectual power.	2001-04-28

You will find Prof. Fisher's answers accurate and positive, because he does not ask random informants (or informants with mischievious motivation) like many other anthroplogists who go on to write books on Sherpas.<br />Essentially, Fisher's interviews show that Sherpa culture remains vibrant, moral, and strongly religious. Great book, highly recommended!	2001-01-24

Neverthless a classic that deserves a place on every Tibetan-English translator's bookshelf. I often consult it as a third-or-fourth opinion (after Rangjung Yeshe and Das) when I am searching for a good English match to the Tibetan. Was a pioneering work in its time, deserves continuing use within limits of its view.	2000-11-06

Excellent general presentation on the arts of sacred geometry and mandala.  I've read it dozens of times, often for looking for analytical knowledge but sometimes  just enjoying the soothing flow of beautiful illustration.  Much insight is  skillfully enclosed in this slender volume.  Highly recommended!	1999-10-02

Sherpa language itself is rarely written, but Ortner went to great lengths to locate  original Sherpa histories actually written by educated Sherpa lamas.  Her  translations of the Sherpa migration (from Kham, Tibet) stories into  English are wonderfully detailed, and her study of Sherpa clan politics,  Sherpa Buddhist beliefs, and finance in the old Sherpa Kingdoms is more  thorough than any other study before or since.  Most of the research for  this voume was conducted in Zhung Gompa (Junbesi) in SharKhumbu, the  Southern Kingdom of the Sherpas.  Surely Lama Dorje, the magical Sherpa  Lama who founded Zhung Gompa, smiles upon this work!	1999-09-21

However, readers will want to know that his 'vedic' perspective is somewhat controversial among professional jyotishi. _Planets in the Signs and Houses_ is written reference-style, so one can easily flip to a specific planet's description.<br />Great for the beginner, esp. those who already know tropical astrology. (Many western astrology books are organized this way.) Writing style is fairly clear western English. However, since a final reading requires *blending* these isolated planetary actions, this book should not be used alone. Other books in the &quot;Vedic Astrologers Handbook&quot; series may fill in the gaps.	1999-01-25

As a result this scholarly work is humble but very comprehensive.  I was assigned &quot;Tibetan Civilization&quot; for a graduate course, and expected it to be dry, full of weighty philosophical terms, and too distant from real Tibet.  I was enormously pleased and surprised to discover its readable treatment of some very abstruse topics such as lama lineages and magical rituals, as well as the authors obvious love and respect for Tibetan traditions.  I recommend &quot;Tibetan Civilization&quot; to all my friends who wish to be educated in the subleties of Vajrayana theology and theocracy without any political arguments. Tashi delek!	1998-05-25
US	52765794	R16YNZXPYSZOR4	0881337455	968775021	Living in the Middle: Sherpas of the Mid-Range Himalayas	Books	3	5	5	N	Y	Heartfelt but spotty research	Donna Sherpa begins her book on Sherpa culture by telling us that it is not a dissertation.  That turns out to be quite true, with both good and bad results!  This book is a personal story of one American woman's relationship with her Sherpa husband, and through him a curious understanding of Sherpa culture as a whole.<br />The book is really a diary and travel story, full of pleasant anecdotes about the author's beloved husband and his relatives.  However, there are a number of factual errors and incomplete tables which reveal that the author has not done her Sherpa culture homework!  Nepali language words are labelled as Sherpa, and both Nepali and Sherpa words are transliterated incorrectly.<br />Although language and meaning errors are probably the result of Mrs. Sherpa's primary informant (her husband) being very partially educated, it is also a sign of poor fact-checking.<br />I would recommend Mrs. Sherpa's book as an entertaining light read for Americans who are interested in one woman's view of Nepal and Sherpa culture, but for factual correctness see Sherry Ortner's or James Fisher's well-researched (and very readable) Sherpa books.	1998-05-24
