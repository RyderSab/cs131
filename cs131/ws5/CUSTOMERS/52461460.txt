The author does a spectacular job of introducing the characters and bringing them to full life.  The founding brothers were a fascinating group of individuals with very differing personalities, which the author captures flawlessly.  The book is more a narrative than 'dry history' which only adds to its readability.  An extremely entertaining and informative read, and highly recomended!	2003-06-06

After living and traveling extensively in Japan, this book felt like reading about home.<br />The authenticity of the location, coupled with the writer's engaging style makes for an excellent read.  Before I started reading I was worried it was going to be another psuedo-japanese fiction like 'rising sun', fortunately I was proven utterly wrong.  The author has obviously walked the very streets and frequented the very bars he writes so well about, as well as has a solid grasp of the culture, which comes through in some interesting observations made by his main character, John.	2002-11-06

From experience, this is exactly how you must learn a foreign language.  The CD isn't cluttered with English sentences - it is all Japanese, which is what you want.  <BR>Listening to the cd alone will help tune your ear to Japanese, and as you are learning, you will be able to pick it up more and more as you go along.  Just be aware that you will need to study the book to make any progress, but if you do study the book, you will improve by leaps and bounds.	2002-08-05

If you can hold on until page 88 or so of the first book, you should be hooked. I haven't read any fantasy since lord of the rings about 10 years ago, and it was good to be back.  The first 88 pages or so are spent on nothing, yet everything.  88 pages setting the story, about the small village from which the 'hero' Rand has never left or intended to leave - a village where everyone is human, there are no gnomes or elves, and monsters and dragons are little more than myth.  a simple sheephearder, drawn into an epic quest beyond his understanding.  I had never heard of the book before, a friend handed it to me, so I read it with no preconceptions or expectations.  Be warned, after the 800+ pages you probably still won't fully grasp what is going on - which is the best reason to keep reading!  Much like the 'vampire chronicles' by Anne Rice, the fact that you are trying to find out what is going on is what keeps you going.  I've only just started book 2, and hope that the author keeps the suspense up for as long as possible.  This book is much deeper than the lord of the rings was or was meant to be, it is not simply a battle of good vs. evil, there are many 'groups' some out for themselves, some not - who knows who are the \\"good guys\\" in this series, least of all Rand?  This book is only recommended for people who enjoy very long and detailed books.  Especially since in total the series is 7000+ pages...  Read it!	2002-02-07

He rationalizes all of the various controversies that surrounded Patton to put Patton in the best light.  There is no controversy, or 'dirt' dug up on Patton here.  Otherwise a fairly quick and very interesting examination of the life of Patton.	2001-06-18

He states that he translated more for readability and 'feel' than flawless accuracy, and thus scholar's looking for a verbatim translation may want to go with another edition, however for someone interested in just reading for enjoyment, this is an excellent and readable narrative, and not at all abstract or convoluted the way some narrative poetries can get.  At the start of each section there is a paragraph or two explanation of what is going to happen, and end notes at the end of each chapter that adds background and other interesting tidbits of info.  Highly reccomended.	2001-06-08

If you want to or have to read Dante, pick up this version translated by John Ciardi.

If you are really interested in MBTI, be prepared to buy 'please understand me' after you read this - it is good for sharpening points and making things clearer.  otherwise, this book is a worthwhile introduction, but you will need to read other books to really 'get a feel' for the MBTI.	2001-06-05

I don't believe it is particularly historically accurate, but why should it be?  It is historical fiction, and a great read at that.  A solid, intelligent plot.  If you have to choose between this and 'enemy at the gates' choose this!	2001-06-04

After having lived in Japan and interacted with Japanese on a daily basis, as well as a good dose of Japanese television and movies, I can tell you that most of the phrases in the book are just not used, are probably outdated, or even taken from obscure dialects.  If you are looking for a good book on Japanese 'slang', I'd reccomend &quot;Kansai Japanese&quot; by Peter Tse - while not really 'slang' per se, it is one of the most interesting and lively dialects in Japan, and more useful than any of the 'slang' found in this book..	2001-06-02

It is very structured, and can help you learn to understand - and speak the Kansai dialect.  The pronounciation is different from standard Japanese, so i'd recomend using the book more so you can understand it rather than speak it, but anyway, it is filled with examples and situations, using dialogs in English, 'standard' Japanese, and 'kansai' Japanese.  Learn Japanese the way it was supposed to be spoken!  After all, if the capital hadn't been moved to Tokyo, this might have BEEN the standard.	2001-06-02

This book is full of interesting revalations, and when read in conjunction with 'please understand me II' and the abovementioned 'Type Talk', it is an excellent resource in helping to understand yourself and those around you.	2001-05-25

This gets my full recommendation, especially if you are a fan of the historian Stephen Ambrose - rather than a dry retelling of history or a historical examination, it is a narrative, from the point of view of the men who were there.  Probably the best introduction for the ameteur historian to D-Day.  A must have for any WWII history buff.	2001-05-25

In true NT style keirsey examines and analyzes all 4 personality types (along with 4 subtypes of each main type)  It is much wider in scope, and with prior knowledge of the MBTI this is a very usefull book.The book examines how the types interact, and more interestingly, delves into psychological motivations of each type, and how each type views the world, interacts with the world, and wishes to be viewed.  It is a bit technically written, lots of vocabulary and presumed prior knowledge of the MBTI, so again, I'd recommend reading the first book, well, first.	2001-05-23

This one, on the other hand, I have attempted to read twice, and NEVER finished it.  Compared to the epic 'Shogun', this book was very slow and clunky.  It is based in fact - the result of the forced opening of Japan in the mid-late 19th century.  however, the story is so realistic as to be dull.  Truth may be stranger than fiction, but in this case anyway, it is hardly as interesting.  The story itself is very coherent and easy to follow.  It is just too DULL.  If you are looking for another &quot;Shogun&quot;, aside from a few interesting (stress on few) tie-ins to &quot;Shogun&quot;, there is nothing there.  Shogun was the pinacle for Clavell.  This just might be the nadir.	2001-05-21

It reads like a fairly dry battle manual, describing Russian tacticts, the 'personality' and leadership style of the Russians, etc.  very little in the way of interesting anecdotes. This is a valuable piece of researh - useful for a historian doing specific research on tacticts on the Russian front, but is little more than a dry overview.  If you are looking for an interesting narative, this is NOT it.  If you are looking for battle tacticts and examinations of the russian way of combat - possibly as research material for a book or research paper, this may be for you, otherwise, you may want to avoid this.	2001-05-18

I saw the movie before reading this book, which is probably the best way to go about it if you don't have much of a background in sailing and/or fishing.  The book is an excellent narative of not only the 'andrea gail' but of various boats, sailboats, and personalities related to gloucester, mass.  The book is well written, as well as respectfully written.  The author obviously has respect for the men who fish off the east coast, and it shows in this book.

This book not only gives a good historical overview of the presidents of the united states, but also interesting psychological profiles - insights as to why they did what they did, and thier motivations, more or less based on the meyers-briggs type indicator.

That is fine, however the author gives a lop sided view - basically giving all the reasons and theories as to why the cosmological constant is valid - you are lead to believe that it has been 'proven' correct - while virtually ignoring the numerous other valid theories.  One notable example of this is the author's dismisal of the 'string' theory in less than a paragraph somewhere near the end of the book with no good argument or explanation as to WHY he feels the string theory is bogus.  considering the physicist brian green was able to write an entire book about why he feels the string theory is not only valid but very likely correct (the elegant universe), I would have hoped that the author of 'god's equation' would have come up with some sort of 'proof' as to why the 'cosmological constant is any more valid.  Otherwise, this is a very interesting book, with interesting insights on Einstein himself, and even a good primer for Einstein's own book, &quot;Relativity&quot;.	2001-05-04

He seems to have been an odd person to say the least based on his habits and personality quirks, but in my opinion, even though the author's purpose is to make him seem more 'human', to me learning all these wierd little details about the life of Hitler makes him as enigmatic as ever....  That aside, it is a fascinating book.  cold hard facts on Hitler without a 'spin' are interesting, but there is not much examination of Hitler, just a collection of details and anecdotes.	2001-04-30

Almost as if his only source material were his previous books...

Originally,  the mystery was the real draw to continue reading the series (Where did  these vampires come from?).  However, since nothing new is gained except  for the life of armand, i give it three stars as a stand-alone book -- not  really a necesary part of the vampire chronicles, but interesting  nonetheless.	1999-07-11
