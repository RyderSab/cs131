At first, I worried that the beautiful book cover would turn out to be just so much eye candy, with nothing to back it up; I was wrong!<br /><br />This story ties together much of the folklore of Christmas, and, most important to me, not only does not omit the Nativity, but accentuates its importance, without coming across as overly-pious or preachy.  The eternal struggle between good and evil is well defined here.  The crass commercialism of \\"Santa Claus\\" seems even more offensive after reading KRINGLE, and I consider that a Good Thing.<br /><br />Another bonus about this book is, boys can enjoy it as well as girls.  In my job as a children's librarian, one struggle is to find \\"boy books.\\"  With his Droon series, Mr. Abbott is practiced  at bridging that gap, and he does it again with KRINGLE. I am delighted to see this hard-cover, beautifully illustrated book published in time for the holidays.  I hope we see more like this from this author, though he does a pretty good job, at the end, in declaring it was something along the lines of \\"just one of those things.\\"  I hope there are more ideas like this lurking in his imagination!	2005-10-10

In the children's department of our public library, when a parent or child asks for reading ideas, we steer them Doreen-Cronin-wards!  Now, she has done it again--this book is hysterically funny, and is enhanced by Harry Bliss' illustrations.<br /> We had the privilege of meeting them both in person in Fort Thomas, Kentucky the other day; I did not think it was possible to be any more impressed, since they are favorites of ours, but I was wrong.  There is a level of understanding of their audience that comes through when one gets a chance to chat with them, as we did.<br /><br />Dorren, if you are reading this, THANK YOU for signing the \\"Team Will\\" books for me!  We see our oncologist in a few days, and I cannot *wait* to present her with them!

She (Ellie) is SOOO over-the-top feminist, why does she put up with repeated rape attempts from another woman, and still refer to her as a good friend?  It is the one discordant note in this one.  If I were *really* going to nit-pick, I might add that I wish I knew if Hat Bowler ever does realize what his departed lover had actually been guilty of, a book or two back???  Does Mr. Hill neglect this, simply because he feels it is unimportant to the current story line?  If that is the case, then why mention Hat's pain at all?  It seems it would be a good thing for Hat to know just how seriously twisted his late lover had been.  Perhaps it would ease the grief, or if not, even better, perhaps it would behoove him to be very cautious in future, before giving his heart away.<br /><br />Thank God these are not real people!  :-)	2005-04-21

Well worth it, too--once again, Richard Peck delivers the type of story we have come to expect, and to appreciate, from him: human, real, funny, wry, and honest.  My only complaint:  Not enough!

The fascinating look at the history of families who lived on Alcatraz, as well as the warm family tale interwoven into that history, made this an unforgettable read for me.  Not only that, but the author did a fine job of representing autism, and the various *out there* treatments available in the 1930's.<br /><br />Somehow, she also works a believable, yet suspenseful, sense of adventure, and understanding of pre-teen feelings, and a knowledge of *baseball* into her work!<br /><br />The sub-themes of spoiled rich kids, parents blinded by their own tendencies to dote--and there is more than one such parent represented in this story!--the scheming that pre-teens can and do manage--these all add to the richness of the reading experience.<br /><br />Get this book for your pre-teen--better yet, read it yourself.  I am far from my middle-school years, and this is one of the best books I have read this summer.	2004-07-27

Like its predecessors, this one made me reexamine what I believe, what I have been taught, the social mores I myself follow, and why I do so.

I am clueless as to if that is what the author intended when she wrote the novel, but that is what happened in my case. All you hide-bound traditionalists out there, take a look at this one.

I am pretty much at the place where I just do not think this man is capable of writing a dud for young adults.  This one is fascinating, not only because each story stands on its own as a small gem, but because of the invaluable insights he gives to the young person who wants to write.  His accounts of how his stories and novels came to be, of how hard work and persistence paid off, just ring so true, and he has a voice that somehow makes a young adult want to listen--as attested by my own three children.<br /><br />He just keeps getting better all the time.	2004-07-25

This was yet another attempt to make money by continuing to stereotype eastern Kentuckians.  *I* live in Winchester, and most of the people I know are nowhere near as provincial as the ones in this book.  Also, the stereotype doesn't even stay true to form!

I can allow Ellen's lust for revenge against a prim and prissy Stephanie--after all, children are vicious, sometimes, to each other, and I felt it was clear that this ongoing battle between the two girls was clearly depicted as such; in fact, Edgar and Ellen are also well-explained as deviant mentalities.  But to have the two of them mistreat an animal (of whatever sort it is) seems to promote such treatment of animals as fun, or cool, somehow.  I found that disturbing.<br />The characters are one-dimensional, but after all, this is what it is--a tale of two evil imps on yet another crusade to destroy something they feel is in their megalomaniacal way.<br />I think a parent could do better in choosing summer reading for his/her child.	2004-06-15

One reviewer says the author brings the Delta to life?  Only if there are readers who truly believe that \\"life\\" means a land where heroines are pursued by not one, but two incredibly perfect males--one of whom globe trots between life-and-death political standoffs and our heroine, Sarah Booth (whose sexual proclivities are mighty virulent)--and where \\"Daddy's Girls\\" still circle the wagons on behalf of each other's so-called honor.<br />This book may have worked in the seventies, possibly a stretch in the eighties, but there is no way anyone with a healthy dose of realism can force it to fit today.  Not only is there a live-in ghost--dredging up unfortunate memories of the Aunt Dimity cozies--but we are treated to frequent sexually-charged romantic interruptions, recalling (shudder) Barbara Cartland and her earls, dukes, and wayward lords.<br />The perpetrator can be guessed rather early on, which made finishing the book even more of a chore.  But finish it I did, so that probably says something about me: an incurable optimist.  I kept believing there had to be *something* at least lightly touching reality in this book.  Another suspension of belief!  I will definitely pass on the series.  If you like a good mystery, not too much gore, and a real brain teaser, this is not the book for you.  If, however, you like a romance-titillator-cozy-snuggums, buy the book.	2004-06-09

While I find the author's position on testing absolutely on target, it disturbs me that Nora ends up deciding that she will continue to hide her abilities in order to have and keep friends.<br />I am *hoping* Mr. Clements wants us to be disturbed in this manner, that he actually is putting this sad finale in place to make teachers, librarians, and especially *parents* consider that this is what our testing community has done to children like Nora.<br />Please, Andrew Clements!

True, once or twice I have wished there had been more discussion: people's reactions to trysyts, to deaths, to surprises... but taken as a whole, the book really does strike the note that time swallows, or at least blurs, so much familial pain.<br />Read the book.

The reader also sees clearly and is able to evaluate the various means of neglect used by different types of parents who all, in the case of this book, seem incapable of prioritizing their child's needs.
