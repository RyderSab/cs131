US	50966767	RIY75TXW05RRB	0758204078	71338817	Looking For It	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Another Great Book by Michael Thomas Ford	I really liked this book. I found it an intense and page turning drama. Michael Thomas Ford seems to have a knack for writing drama's that have large casts and mutiple storylines and he blends them together magically. This is the story of John and Russell a couple who decides to split after seven years, Simon an older man dealing with the death of his long term lover and moving on, Thomas a priest dealing with his sexuality and his future in the church, last but definitely not least Mike a bartender who is looking for love and possibly a career change. Throw into the mix Pete a mechanic who has some anger management issues, a man who enjoys sex with men but who is adamently not gay. This book is very dark compared to 'Last Summer' and the authors humorous essays, and that is what I liked about this book. I loved the fact that it was dark and not merely a light fluffy romance, it had romance but it also had a sadistic violent edge that kept me up late into the night reading to discover what is going to happen next. I really liked 'Last Summer' but felt that this book is much better and I am anxiously looking for to Michael Thomas Ford's next fiction effort.	2004-09-19

It was definitely a page turner and had a great fast paced story line. It is about a group of Manhattanites during the course of a few days and their lives in and around plays whether on or off Broadway. I liked the book but at the end I felt like I really didn't get to know the character too well. Christopher Bram wrote another wonderful story but I felt that the story was really lacking character development. Besides Caleb and Jessie Doyle you really have no idea of what the characters went through in the past. Like with the youngest character, Toby, the only thing I really know about him is that he is from Wisconsin...that's it. What kind of life did he have in Wisconsin that would make him move to NYC and start to strip? I liked the book a great deal I just thought that it would have been a better book if the author would have fleshed out the characters a little more.	2004-02-19

I then read the summary of the book and gave it a try. I have never heard of Michael Thomas Ford so I decided to give the book a try and was astounded. This is one of the best gay books I have read in quite a while. All the characters were very likable and realistic. The bond that the characters build throughout the summer in Provincetown is very believable. I hated when the book ended because you lose contact with many of the characters you grew to love through the novel. I hope that Michael Thomas Ford is planning a sequel because I would love to know what the characters are going to be up to next summer.	2003-10-24

I wasn't really fond of the Hudsons series and the first three books in the DeBeers series didn't impress me but this was a considerable improvement.  I liked the fact that the book moved quickly and kept the reader wondering what was going to happen next. I knew most of Grace's story from the previous books in the series and it was nice to get the whole story from her point of view instead of Willow or Hannah's. After reading this book I am eager to read 'Hidden Leaves' to see how Grace's story finishes. This is definitely one of the ghostwriters better books.	2003-02-13

The story is about five friends and an extremely famous movie star in a rundown mansion in St Tropez and the month they spend together. This is most possibly one of the most repetitive Danielle Steel books I have ever read. She keeps making the same points over and over again. Pascale and Diana distrust Gwen, we get the point, yet the author repeats this and the reasons why on almost every single page. Plus, alot of the little 'surprises' you see from the beginning. This is not a horrible reading experience, and it's also not too enjoyable.	2002-10-05

This book reminds me of my  favorite Jackie Collins book, 'Chances'. It starts in the present and then goes back many years and keeps flipping from past to present until the story merges into a suspense filled page turning climax. The story is the third book with Madison Castelli, but instead of her being the star of the book it deals with her father Michael and his long time lover Dani. The book is filled wth sex, violence, drugs and many shocking twists and turns. This is certainly a book that is hard to put down has a satisfying ending. I hope there are more books with Madison and Michael Castelli in the future. Aren't we also due for another Lucky Santangelo book?	2002-09-14

The ending seems far fetched and the characters one dimensial but their was alot of suspense that kept me turning the pages and finish this book in one day. I have read all of James Pattersons books and feel that this one was not written by him because the writing style seems so different from his other books, I feel Peter De Jonge wrote it and James Patterson probably gave his name just so it would sell, but I don't know. Overall a good book just nothing worth recommending.	2002-08-29

I was excited when I heard 'The Snow Garden' was coming out, so I got it as soon as it was available. I read and enjoyed the novel  but I don't plan on rereading this one. The plot was, in my opinion, very gripping and the suspense just kept building and building until the explosive climax but I didn't care for the ending. Sure a majority of all the books questions are answered but I feel that there is alot of stuff that Christopher Rice could have added to make the ending a little more fulfilling. I felt I was left with too many 'what about's' at the end of the book. I am still a Christopher Rice fan and eagerly looking forward to his next novel.	2002-03-26
US	50966767	R12WOKE5XJEHKB	0671039962	48569798	Honey	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A typical VC Andrews book	This book is pretty good, it has a lot of romance, and mystery. It's the story of a young girl, Honey, who comes from a family with dark secrets and a very religious grandfather. She loves to play the violin and her teacher thinks she has potential and has her and another student get together to practice and of course they fall for each other. Then the typical Andrews storylines take over. Secrets come bursting out, family members go crazy, students tease Honey and Chandler for their relationship. Not the best book in the series, that belongs to Ice, but it does make me anxious for 'Falling Stars'.	2001-11-07

It was a quick read because it was hard to put down but when you finished you feel a little cheated. There is something missing, the characters weren't completely fleshed out, and the ending was wrapped up too quickly and too happily. The book starts where 'Not A Day Goes By' ended with Yancey and Basil living their seperate successful lives, but throw Bart Dunbar into the mix and lives are thrown into chaos. I am eager for the sequel because this book did have few loose ends that I would like to see get wrapped up and hopefully the sequel will have more scenes with Raymond.	2001-07-26

The main character Libby decides that she doesn't want to have a relationship she just wants a fling, because if guys can do it so easily why can't she, but then she meets Nick. He is everything she wants gorgeous, good kisser, even better in bed, but then she sees his bedsit, his friends, and his income and is not sure this is right for her. Then she meets Ed who is the complete opposite of Nick, rich, powerful, lovely friends, not that cute, messy kisser, and lousy in bed. There is no surprise in how the book ends but the book is so fun and funny that I would recommend it to anyone who wants something to read for a day at the pool or beach.	2001-07-16

I wasn't a juvenile deliquent and my brother wasn't in a coma, but everything else was there. The close relationship with his mother, buying broadway showtunes, and questioning his sexuality. The main difference I was only a year old when the action in this  book took place. It's the story of Robin MacKenzie coming of age in 1978 in New Jersey. It deals with many, many things, feeling responsible for his brother being in a coma, being attracted to boys, having a family falling apart. Once you start this book it is hard to put down, for me there were many late nights. This is an author that will be added to my must-read list.	2001-06-05

Lara Mallory ruined Clark Tackett's political career so Clark either killed himself or someone killed him, so why would Lara return to Eden Pass, Clarks hometown. Key, Clarks brother, and Jody, Clarks mother, just want her out so they will do anything to see it happen but Lara has one thing she needs to do and she will needs Key help. A wonderful novel with twists and turns you will not see coming, plus the secondary characters have great storylines also.	2001-05-31

This book would have been alot better (and shorter) if she would have stuck with the main story line. The story starts with Alice's point of view, moves to her husband Howard, then ends with Alice. The story is very involving and emotional the only problem is the characters aren't that likeable. Alice is so passive aggressive and weird at times. When her husband comes and visits her in the jail she is talking off the wall. Howard is distance and doesn't even acknowledge his wives presence  until she is arrested. A good book just not rereadable	2001-05-22

So I started it and was disappointed right away. This book, like most books, didn't get my interest right away. It also didn't hold my interest like other books. I found my mind wandering so I would have to go back and reread certain passages. Then when I finished the book I was disappointed. What was the point of this book? I read this whole book and didn't get anything from it. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone and will make sure I never read this book for a second time.	2001-05-04
US	50966767	R323WFRZWHH8WJ	0553104144	676623025	Riley in the Morning	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Too Predictable	I enjoy Sandra Brown and read many of her books but found this one highly predictable. I know that these books were originally published as Loveswept romances back in the early to mid-eighties and are just being released in hardcover so I wasn't expecting the usual suspense format. But 'In A Class By Itself' and this book have been let downs because after the first chapter you know why the character walked out on the man that they love and it usually isn't anything shocking or earth shattering. I'll continue to read these books I'll just have to make sure I kept my expectations low.	2001-05-02
US	50966767	RC97HHGASQ9E3	0385265700	836824873	The Book of Ruth	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Wonderful, yet dark novel	This was a very interesting read, yet very disturbing. It's the story of Ruth, growing up and her painful life.  Ruth gets picked on because she is poor and not all that smart.  As she gets older her life doesn't get any better, that is until she meets and falls in love with Ruby.  Little does she know what lies in her future. I started this book and could not put it down. You feel so sorry for Ruth yet you have a feeling that she will not experience the true happiness you wish for her. One character I wish we saw more of was Matt, Ruth's genius little brother, who moves to Boston early on in the novel. A highly recommendable book, not for every one though.	2001-04-30

Right away the book introduces many interesting characters that you learn things about throughout the book and I liked that it didn't give the surprises away right at the beginning. You learn alot about Milkman and his friends and family and that was nice to read about.  Then Milkman goes on a search for gold and that was when the book began to lose me. I thought Milkman's search and his spitirual and emotional journey was boring. I never felt Milkman was that likeable of a character and he meets &quot;his people&quot; and then he suddenly changes. I just didn't feel that Milkman was that type of character.	2001-04-23
US	50966767	R2BZHD2CI6844S	038550117X	133960389	Disobedience: A Novel	Books	3	2	4	N	N	My First Jane Hamilton Experience	I read the summary of this book and it sounded good.  Then I started it and, I don't know if this applies to all of Jane Hamilton's books, discovered that she goes on page after page of rambling. This would have been a better book if she wouldn't spend pages rambling about things that usually have nothing to do with the progressment of the plot. The only character I found interesting was Elvira. This book would have had a higher rating if the author just stuck to the story and left the randomless thought behind, but by then it would have ended up a short story.	2001-04-17

Once I started I couldn't stop, the short chapters is the primary thing that made it a fast read. I enjoyed the book but my problem is that it is highly forgettable. I have read all of the Alex Cross books but can hardly remember anything about any of the novels that I read almost a year ago. I remember almost all of the Patricia Cornwell novels and Susan Grafton novels but Alex Cross is just forgettable. The book is good it just doesn't stick with you.	2001-04-17

What a mistake.  I couldn't put it down, I was so pruny, the bubbles were gone, the water was turning cold, yet I continued to turn the pages. I got almost to the halfway point when I decided to get out of the tub and the rough day at work was far behind me. I loved the transformation of heavy Jemima J to the slim JJ.  Yes, it was predictable but it was a good book and it is nice to read something light and fun every once in awhile.	2001-04-17

But Anne Rice's son is a brilliant writer. This book was fast paced and gripping. The book has twists and turns from the first chapter to the last page. You get involved with the characters and love them even through their flaws. Christopher Rice is an author that I will make sure I follow.	2001-04-16

Strong and interesting characters, and a fast paced plot with many twists and turns that are not expected. All the characters seem to be hiding something and there is just so much stuff going on that you become so engrossed in the book that it could be finished in just a day because once you pick this book you won't want to put it down until you turn the final page. Sandra Brown is one of the best mystery/suspense/romance authors around.	2001-04-14

The sad thing was that many of the stories I thought were true turned out to be urban legends. My only problem was after each urban legend the author decides to give you the background of each legend.  I'm sure some people are interested in the origins of the legends, when they were first heard and what part of the world they were first heard in. I was primarily interested in the legends and could have done without the history lesson.	2001-04-14

But that wasn't the case because when I picked up the book I couldn't put it down. You feel as if you become an actual Birdseye family member because you are there for the good times and the bad times. My only problem with the book was the ending. The 'and they lived happily ever after' just didn't fit in with the rest of the book.	2001-04-12

It was a wonderful book, it kept your attention all the way through. I loved how it kept going back to Willy Jack and his trials and tribulations after he dumped Novalee off at wal-Mart. I would recommend this book if you want a light, easy read.	2001-04-10

Books that deal with aliens and UFO's are not my favorite books to read. The only way I would read one those books is if Stephen King wrote it. This was a good book, it got me interested and it kept building the suspense so I was eagerly turning the pages to see what would happen next.  Not his best book but it should be read nonetheless.	2001-04-10
