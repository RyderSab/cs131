I picked up Sid Fleischman's \\"The Giant Rat of Sumatra (or Pirates Galore)\\" because of the title, and I casually started it at work, and then I was late back from break. Thanks a lot, Sid Fleischman. Your book is the best read I've had in a long time.<br /><br />Twelve year-old \\"Shipwreck\\" has found himself the reluctant cabin boy of the gloriously decaying pirate ship \\"The Giant Rat of Sumatra\\" (so named because of the rat figurehead). His shipmates aren't a bad lot, for pirates, and when the deadly but decidedly charming Captain Gallows pulls into San Diego harbor it's clear that \\"The Giant Rat of Sumatra\\" has sailed her last voyage. The pirates are given the option to either find a new berth or join the Captain in his new life as a Don of Mexico. Shipwreck, though, isn't really given a choice. After a spontaneous display of loyalty to his Captain he is made the unwilling bearer of the emerald eyes of the Giant Rat herself. Walking around with a fortune sewn into your coat hem is nervous work when all your associates are pirates.<br /><br />From there we have a serious of wild adventures involving one-armed men and lady bandits, underwater duels and pirate treachery, disguises and revelations, until at last we arrive at the final showdown as San Diego falls to the invading American army (it is 1846, after all).<br /><br />A blast from start to finish, the \\"Rat of Sumatra\\" is a must for any fan (of any age) of pirate lore or adventure novels. Fleischman is a first-rate storyteller, weaving a fun plot with genuine literary merit and a beautiful way with words. I can't recommend this book enough, particularly if you've run out of Leon Garfield and are looking for someone new to keep you turning the pages.<br /><br />A word on the title: When I first saw the book I thought the title was a reference to a hilarious article a few years back about obscure movie quotes. The author of the article stated that the all time greatest (and hardest to drop into a conversation) quote was \\"Have you ever heard of the Giant Rat of Sumatra?\\", a line from an old Sherlock Holmes film. When I saw this book I thought it couldn't be a coincidence and Fleischman was one cool guy. I still think he's cool, but apparently it was a coincidence. The title is an allusion to the Holmes story, but not the article. No matter, a four and a half star book (which for Amazon purposes I'll round up to five) that needs to be famous.<br /><br />I do feel it could have done with a bit more suspense at the end (a la \\"Black Jack\\") but the overall journey was a decided pleasure. And Hollywood, if you make the film version, Antonio Banderas for Captain Gallows please. Or Diego Luna will be fine too. Get going!<br /><br />GRADE: A-/B+rd of the Giant Rat of Sumatra?\\", a line from an old Sherlock Holmes film.

James White isn't a well-known sci-fi name, despite the huge sales of his delightful \\"Sector General\\" series. His books aren't flashy; there's little violence, even less sex, and no coarse language. But when it comes to writing thought-provoking, inventive, and just plain entertaining stories, in my opinion White is up there with Asimov and Heinlein.<br /><br />In all the Galactic Federation there is not a more revered and honored chef than Gurronsevas, whose culinary talents are well-known by every species. He can easily command any salary in any of the most prestigious hotels and resorts in the galaxy, but after a lifetime of cooking for the rich and powerful, he finds to his horror that he is growing bored. What he needs is a challenge, and what bigger challenge could there be for a chef than the kitchens of the gigantic, awesome, famous and infamous Sector General Hospital?<br /><br />The challenge proves a whopper even for this legend. How, for instance, can Gurronsevas improve the meals of beings that breathe chlorine, when one whiff of their air would poison him? How can he prepare a feast for someone whose mind contains the consciousness of more than one species, none of whom eat the same thing? And how can he navigate the delicate and fragile world of a multi-species hospital when he's built like an elephant? This last one gets him into one scrape too many, and it is in disgrace that he is sent on a dangerous final mission: Convince the population of a dying world to stop starving themselves to death. Can the greatest cook in the universe save an entire planet?<br /><br />The problems are interesting, the solutions ingenious, and as always with White the journey fun and fascinating. All his books are page-turners, and this one's no exception. And while tenth in the \\"Sector General\\" series, \\"The Galactic Gourmet\\" is a stand-alone and can be read by a newcomer. If you like this, please get ahold of the first three \\"Sector General\\" novels, often sold together in an omnibus. While the beginning of the series deals more with the medical aspect of White's brilliant creation, all the tales of \\"Sector General\\" are worth reading. Please don't let this one pass you by!<br /><br />GRADE: B+/A-ogether in an omnibus.

Seven years later and this is still my favorite book; Fun, funny, thrilling and wondrous. \\"The Warrior's Apprentice\\" was the first and still remains the best work of Lois McMaster Bujold (and for this lady that is saying something).<br /><br />Meet Miles Vorkosigan: Eighteen, crippled, tiny, and what can only be called a genius of life. After failing to get into officer's school, he goes to visit his grandmother (living in another solar system) for a cheering up, and comes back the general of his own private army.<br /><br />Everything is between is sheer roller-coaster bliss, with twists and turns galore. Wonderfully crafted characters, sharp dialogue, a nice mix of sci-fi and fantasy and a sense of triumph lacing throughout, this book made Bujold a star and never was the status so well deserved.<br /><br />I was introduced to \\"Apprentice\\" by a good friend who told me \\"Prepare to fall in love\\" and that Bujold could make a deformed dwarf a sex symbol is a tribute to her powers. Once you read this you'll surely want to read the sequels, and while they vary in quality (\\"Borders of Infinity\\" is my favorite) Miles himself always remains the star attraction. One in a thousand and not to be missed.<br /><br />(Also check out the story of Lord and Lady Vorkosigan's romance in the excellent \\"Shards of Honor\\".)	2005-07-05

Here's a good idea: Collect obscure novellas (too long to be in short story collections but not long enough to be published alone) by great mystery authors and publish them together in an omnibus. Reader's Digest did it, and so we have here four complete and original novellas by Leslie Charteris, G.K. Chesterton, Michael Gilbert and the always awesome Dorothy L. Sayers. They vary in quality, so if you're just browsing here's a quick breakdown:<br /><br />1.) The Beauty Specialist- Leslie Charteris  This is one of over 150 stories Charteris wrote about The Saint, and I was very excited to read it. Unfortunately, while the characters are interesting and the plot decent Charteris' writing style is really, really bad. If you're not a stickler for grammar or a fan of Strunk & White's \\"The Elements of Style\\" you might not notice, but everyone else is likely to be driven crazy by Charteris' muddled sentences and excessive use of adverbs. The guy needed an editor but bad. GRADE: C/B-<br /><br />2.) The Oracle of the Dog- G.K. Chesterton<br />Chesterton's a far better writer, and it shows here in one of his classic Father Brown stories. Unlike a lot of mystery fans I don't think the plot of \\"Oracle\\" is anything spectacular, but it's tight and holds your interest. GRADE: B/B-<br /><br />3.) The Cleaners- Michael Gilbert<br />An Inspector Petrella mystery. I liked this one all the way up until the ending, which I felt negated everything that came before. Read it and see what I mean. What was the point? GRADE: B-/C+<br /><br />4.) The Incredible Elopement of Lord Peter Whimsey- Dorothy L. Sayers<br />Yay! Always a pleasure to read a Lord Peter mystery, isn't it? They're just so classy and fun. This has exotic locations, a great villain, a damsel in distress (beautiful, of course), and Lord Peter playing with peoples minds. What more could you want?<br />GRADE: B+/A-<br /><br />So there you have it, and hopefully you have enough info to decide if you want to buy the collection. Enjoy!	2004-08-27

This translation by James Magruder is excellent, even if slightly flawed (Magruder has a tendency to inject English slang that is a little distracting in a period piece) and there's even a list of props in the back in case you get inspired to stage your own version.<br /><br />The plot? Okay, hold on, here goes: The Princess Leonide, sitting on a usurped throne she has inherited, decides to pay a visit to the sole surviving member of the original royal family. His name is Agis, and one look at his hunky self is all it takes to send Leonide over the moon in love. Unfortunately, he has been most carefully raised by his two guardians, Hermocrate and Leontine, to be scornful of love, hate women, and detest the Princess, whom he has never seen. What's a girl to do? Dress up as a boy and make all three of them fall in love with her, of course.<br />It really just gets loopier from there, and it's all pretty silly, but the real appeal in Marivaux's play is not the plot, but the language. It's marvelous. Since most of the scenes consist of the characters being talked in and out of love, the play is a mine of great speeches. There's also plenty of wit and humor (I especially love Agis' distress on being the only one not to receive a portrait), and a spirit of fun throughout. What it does lack is an ending. It just sort of stops. The recent movie version, with Mira Sorvino as the Princess, added an ending that was good enough to fool me; it was so seamless and matched Marivaux's style so well I was genuinely surprised when I finally read the play and discovered it had been tacked on. If you like the play, go ahead and rent the movie, it's not half bad and you get a satisfying ending.<br />In any case, know that the \\"Triumph of Love\\" is a semi-neglected gem well worth both going to see and reading, especially if you're a Shakespeare fan and are looking for something new. As Magruder says in his introduction, \\"Love is delightful and love is cruel, leaving victors and victims in its wake. Marivaux honors both extremes in his wonderful play.\\" Enjoy!<br />GRADE: B+cially if you're a Shakespeare fan and are looking for something new.

Even though I worked in a library for years and read dozens of books a month, I am ashamed to admit that I hadn't read any of Noel Perrin's recommendations outlined in &quot;A Reader's Delight&quot;. I have now, though.<br />In essay after wonderful essay, Perrin uncovers gem after glorious gem. From Russian Sci-Fi (\\"Far Rainbow\\") to World War II memoirs (\\"When the Snow Comes, They Will Take You\\") , from lyrical fiction (\\"The Bottom of the Harbor\\") to the next-best-thing to Jane Austen (\\"The Semi-Attached Couple\\"), many of these books are out-of-print, some truly obscure, and all of them terrific.<br />Startling eclectic, Perrin discuses books from virtually every genre and he does so with grace and wit. There's tales of ancient China, old journals, satires, children's books and even a poem. This is guy who not only knows good books, but adores them, and he doesn't care where he finds them. In the introduction, Perrin tells about a professor he knew who cited the \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" books among his all time favorites, and Perrin makes it clear that true book-lovers know no snobbishness.<br />Some of these books will be a bit hard to track down, but most can be had by simply utilizing your local interlibrary loan program. In any case, \\"A Reader's Delight\\" is a must have for those who love a good read, not only for the recommendations but for Perrin's own stylish writing.<br />GRADE: B+	2004-05-29

The story is engrossing, and the description of a small town and the changes that come to it is excellent.<br />My only quibble is the disposal of my favorite character halfway through the novel. Other than that, this is a great book that was once very popular but has now slipped into obsurity.

I have a good friend who to all intents and purposes is a normal everyday housewife, but who just happens to own the most spectacular collection of sci-fi you can possibly imagine. A few years ago she handed me &quot;Test of Honor&quot;; an omnibus containing &quot;Shards of Honor&quot; and &quot;The Warrior's Apprentice&quot;, both by legendary sci-fi writer Lois McMaster Bujold. &quot;Prepare to fall in love,&quot; she told me, and she was right. McMaster is a must-read for anyone who considers themselves a fan of science fiction. &quot;Shards of Honor&quot; was the first McMaster I read, and while not quite up to the level of &quot;The Warrior's Apprentice&quot; (which was definitely her masterpiece and one of the greatest sci-fi novels of all time), it is still a splendid introduction to her work and the world of Miles Vorkosigan.<br />&quot;Shards of Honor&quot; details the meeting and subsequent romance of Miles' parents, Cordelia Naismith and Aral Vorkosigan, on a backwater planet during an interplanetary skirmish. Despite belonging to opposing sides of the conflict they fall in love and the rest of the novel chronicles their adventures (together and apart) as they struggle to survive both physically and spiritually in a time of war. This book will be especially interesting to those who love the Miles Vorkosigan character; as he is an exact blend of his parent's more spectacular qualities.<br />As with all of McMaster's books, &quot;Shards of Honor&quot; moves at a breathtaking pace and is crammed with wonderful dialogue and characters. If you haven't yet read any of her books, &quot;Shards of Honor&quot; is a great place to start, but if you are only going to read one, I would have to say let it be &quot;The Warrior's Apprentice&quot;, the next in the series and the first to feature Miles. McMaster hit an all-time high with &quot;Apprentice&quot; which she hasn't yet managed to duplicate, but &quot;Shards of Honor&quot; belongs alongside &quot;Borders of Infinity&quot; as her next-best work.

I spent the<br />next few days completely engrossed in his lively tales on the chemistry involved in our daily lives.<br />Discussed here is the science behind ice cream, aspartame, wheat, bagels, paprika, beer and yes, cookies. Schwarcz also chimes in on the controversies over dental fillings, botulin, lead paints, DNA manipulation and genetic engineering. He shares fascinating stories about some of history's greatest scientists (of particular interest is the inventor of Nylon, who ended up committing suicide, and the man behind chemical warfare, who also saved millions of lives with his fertilizer experiments). There is also a section devoted to debunking health scams and diffusing unnecessary paranoia.<br />While I didn't agree with all of Schwarcz's opinions (I think he may be a little naive in regards to the dangers of genetic modification), the breadth of his scientific knowledge is impressive and his enthusiasm for science infectious. &quot;The Way the Cookie Crumbles&quot; is an entertaining and informative read for both the scientifically minded and those just interested in learning how to get ink stains out of their clothes (try using limonene or amyl acetate).<br />GRADE: A-/B+	2003-05-13

Rudolf Besier's \\"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\\" is an excellent play based on a turbulent period in the life of the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Elizabeth is an invalid who along with her many brothers and sisters lives in terror of her borderline insane father. He rules his house with an iron fist, forbidding any of his children to marry or even have friends.<br />Into this nightmare comes fellow poet Robert Browning, who through a combination of tender ardor and sheer stubbornness forever changes the life of Elizabeth, and ultimately all of the Barretts. The final scene, where the family comes to terms with a great shock, is both frightening and triumphant.<br />Besier's play is rooted in fact and tightly paced, with an incredibly suspenseful ending, especially since most people know how Barrett's life turned out. Good, solid dialogue and an interesting historical backdrop make this play well worth reading.<br />GRADE: A-	2003-04-24

The subtitle, &quot;100 Best Poems to Memorize&quot; is misleading, because for every good choice (like Byron's &quot;So We'll Go No More A' Roving&quot;) there are at least two no-so-great ones (&quot;Lord Randall&quot; and &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot;) and a few selections are downright inexplicable (Why would anyone want to memorize &quot;The Song of the Mad Prince&quot;?). An ideal poem for memorization should combine deep meaning with a strong rhyme, making it easier to burn into your mind. &quot;A Mending Wall&quot;, by Robert Frost, while a great poem, in my mind is just too hard to memorize. &quot;Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot; would have been a better Frost choice. Tennyson's &quot;Ulysses&quot; is just way too long, and other selections suffer from plain old mediocrity. The only truly excellent choice here in my view is actually the first one, Elizabeth Bishop's &quot;Sonnet&quot;. It's down hill from there.<br />In conclusion, if you really want to memorize one hundred wonderful poems I recommend just checking out &quot;Committed to Memory&quot; from the library, gleaning what you can, and then buying &quot;Poems to Read&quot;, by the Favorite Poem Project; a terrific anthology that has at least fifty poems well worth committing to memory.

After asking his readers to send in postcards detailing the songs they hated the most, Dave was astonished to receive over 10,000 replies, with votes still coming in to this day.<br />Realizing he had touched a nerve (\\"People were stopping me on the street, grabbing me by the shirt, and with cold fury in their eyes saying things like: 'You know that song about the pina coladas? I hate that song. I HATE IT.'\\") Dave devoted two columns to his bad song survey and eventually wrote this book, a celebration of some truly horrifying \\"music\\". Included here are the original winners of the survey, as well as special sections on \\"Teen Death Songs\\", \\"Song Women Really Hate\\" (such as the immortal Crystals' tune \\"He Hit Me and It Felt Like a Kiss\\") and \\"Weenie Music\\" (Barry Manilow features heavily in this chapter, as I am sure you can imagine). Hilarious from beginning to end, my only complaint about the \\"Bad Song Book\\" is that at less than 100 pages it feels a little slight.<br />One hundred pages though IS enough to generate an enormous amount of pain as we remember dreadful song after song (by the time he got to \\"You Light Up My Life\\" I had to briefly stop reading so I could roll around the floor, clutching my head), so maybe this kind of thing is better taken in small dosages.

Far more detailed than the illustrations of his books, the paintings in particular range from gently witty to absolutely dazzling.<br />Many great painters use the canvas to tell a story; Seuss goes a step farther. Each of his paintings are like a portal into an amazing little world. &quot;Cat Detective in the Wrong Part of Town&quot; evokes a seedy 50's mystery story, but with cats. Cats, by the way, are a major theme of this collection. They pop up everywhere, doing everything: Dancing the night away in &quot;Cat Carnival in West Venice&quot;, playing pool in &quot;Cat from the Wrong Side of the Tracks&quot;, even taking a shower in &quot;Cat in Obsolete Shower Bath (Study)&quot;. Seuss packs a lot of feeling into his subjects; &quot;Lonely&quot; sums up isolation about as well as anything I've seen, and several untitled pieces each show one lone bird flying serenely above a stormy sea. My favorite painting is entitled &quot;I Dreamed I Was a Doorman at the Hotel del Coronado&quot;. With its dreamy South American feel and bright colors it reminds me of an old Technicolor movie from the forties.<br />I can't recommend this book enough, the paintings are just wonderful. I never get tired of looking at them. A complete must-own for any Seuss fan, or just any lover of the whimsical. A+	2003-01-01

Maybe it started as far back as when Jules Verne and H.G. Wells first began reflecting our society through the mirror of alien worlds, but at some point in the last century a surprising trend became evident: The most brilliant minds in the literary universe were writing science fiction. No book emphasizes this point more then Orson Scott Card's &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, one of the most chokingly powerful books I have ever read (and as a librarian, I've read quite a few).<br />&quot;Ender&quot; is comparatively underread, though, because its story of one boy's redemption in the face of unspeakable crimes is disguised as a rollicking space-story. So if you are one of those people who as a rule stick to just one genre (or as a buddy of mine told me the other day: &quot;I'll read anything but science fiction&quot;) please, PLEASE don't let that stop you from reading this incredible book. And if you do give it a chance, please don't read anything further about the plot; the full impact of Scott's genius is best felt with no prior preperation (that's why I haven't given a plot summerary). When he finally pulls all the threads of the story together, you'll feel like you've just slammed into a brick wall.<br />This is a novel that stays with you forever, warning you of the ease of losing your soul , and filling you with hope if you're looking to regain it.<br />Absolutely not to be missed.	2002-11-29

Somewhat forgotten now by all but the hardcore of sci-fi fans, Sheckley has spent the last five decades written gleefully insane social satires, including such classics as \\"Immortality, Inc.\\", \\"Journey Beyond Tommorrow\\", and his masterpeice, \\"Dimension of Miracles\\". \\"MindSwap\\", written in 1966, has Sheckley in fine form and is a great place to start if you have never been subjected to his dementia.<br />The plot starts off simply: In the future, interstellar travel between Earth and the many many known alien worlds is extremely expensive, so in order to see the galaxy some brave souls resort to \\"MindSwap\\", a service that switches your consciousness with that of a compatible alien lifeform. You enjoy a new body, new sourroundings and even new skills while still maintaing your own mind and memories, all at a low low cost. This is precisely what Marvin, our hero, sets out to do as the novel begins. He quickly runs into a snag, though, as his actual body (now inhabited by the consciousness of the alien whose body Marvin controls) is unexpectedly stolen. Then Marvin finds out HE is in a stolen body himself, and a judge gives him six hours to locate a spare body, and time is running out....<br />The plot then truly takes off as Marvin visits one crazy world after another, taking jobs that nobody else wants (often with very good reason) just to have a body to stay alive in. Jeweled Egg hunting (watch out for those Ganzers!), waiting out a ticking bomb (located up his nose), and other adventures quickly cure Marvin of his wanderlust and give Sheckley's sparkling wit a chance to shine. Master of the truly unexpected plot twist, Sheckley is also famous for dreaming up nutty concepts that he manages to explain in borderline convincing ways . The best example of this in \\"MindSwap\\" is his \\"Theory of Searches\\", which states that if you are searching for someone, they, whether they know it or not, are also searching for you. And if someone is looking for you, you might as well stay in one place and let them find you. And one waiting place, of course, is as good as another, and this is how Marvin finds himself hanging out in a Mexican Cantina, where he does indeed find many people he has lost (unfortunately mostly relatives).<br />I haven't even mentioned the love interest (the EXTREMELY elusive Cathy), the grueling journey across a frozen wasteland (to get to the Cantina, of course) and, for no apparent reason at all, a twenty page Medieval Battle (complete with full histories of the clans involved). All of this culminates in the most inspired creation of all, the dreaded, nightmare-filled \\"Twisted World\\". Darkly hinted at throughout the novel, when we finally get to see it, it is both not what we expected, and if you think about it, far worse than we could of imagined (actually, it kind of reminded me of the DMV). The book ends on a rather strange note, and I found that the only way to be at peace with the ending is either to completely think it through, or not think about it at all. Either way, it may put you off travel for a while.<br />Fun, funny, insightful and intensely creative, \\"MindSwap\\" is a terrific ride that should appeal to fans of absurdist humor, sharply written satire, or just plain great writing. Highly recommended.ne, they, whether they know it or not, are also searching for you. And if someone is looking for you, you might as well stay in one place and let them find you.

US	49214860	R2O4THA59NQYQB	1853753904	90323773	Mapp & Lucia (Prion Humour Classics)	Books	4	62	62	N	N	Mapp and Lucia: Napoleons of the Tea Room	This is the first book I've read in E.F. Benson's \\"Lucia\\" series, and it is fun-filled ride indeed. For Benson novices, Lucia Lucas is a middle aged, recently widowed (in this novel), perfectly nice upper middle class woman who just happens to have the mind of Machavelli. Missing her obvious calling for World Domination, she is instead content to rule the social life of her small English village with an iron fist. As \\"Mapp and Lucia\\" begins however, Lucia has long since deposed any serious threat to her social dominance in her immediate vicinity, and decides fresher pastures are in order. She packs up her things (including , of course, best friend and right-hand-man Georgie) and moves to Tilling, where she expects she will be made society Queen in no time flat. Unfortunately for Lucia, Tilling already has a Queen, one Elizabeth Mapp, and she has no intention of relinquishing her crown.<br />The scene is thus set for a true Battle Royal, only in Tilling the battelfields are luncheons and dinner parties, and the weapons fruit gardens and lobster recipes. The results are very very funny, as the genteel of Tilling spend a breathless year thoroughly enjoying each swipe, snub and put down. The hilarious climax has our heroines floating out to sea on an overturned kitchen table, with Lucia's last audible words promising delicious gossip just as soon as she gets out of her current mess.<br />Benson draws his characters exquisitely well, I found myself flat out liking her. She is an Englishwomen of the 1930's, past her prime but still youthful, who just happens to be blessed (cursed?) with the personality of an Alpha Male. The resulting battle of wits with the formidable Mapp is fascinating; Mapp is clearly not her intellectual equal but through a mixture of deviousness and and cunning manages to pull the carpet from underneath Lucia's carefully laid plans time and again. The supporting characters are equally well written, with best friend Georgie and Mapp's crony Diva especially amusing.<br />All in all, a funny, entertaining and biting satire that is well worth reading whether you are already a Lucia fan or are picking up a Benson novel for the first time. Highly recommended!ially amusing.<br />All in all, a funny, entertaining and biting satire that is well worth reading whether you are already a Lucia fan or are picking up a Benson novel for the first time.

US	49214860	R15OONZGD3GHEX	0446340006	890228207	Mansfield Revisited	Books	2	8	10	N	N	Hmmm, I Think Not	Rest assured I am not an Austen purist disgusted by the whole concept of someone picking up the beloved Austen torch. Far from it; I only require good or at the least entertaining writing and I'm happy. \\"Mansfield Revisted\\" does not fullfill these requirements, mostly due to one of the worst endings I have come across in quite a while.<br />Things start out rather well, actually, as the novel follows the romantic adventures of Fanny's younger sister Susan as she resides at Mansfield while Fanny and her husband are away in Antigua. Many of the old characters return, and I have to give Aiken credit for creditably fleshing out the character of the wicked Mary Crawford. Since the end of Austen's novel, Mary has suffered a great deal, and Aiken does a good job of making her a tad more complex. What she does with Henry Crawford is interesting also; although here Aiken sows the seeds of her novel's undoing. (SPOILER) She sets up Henry to be the romantic hero of her novel, a mildly shocking idea for fans of the original. The next third of the book is devoted to the evolving relationship between him and Susan, and we come to expect the inevitable. And then, in a highly annoying manner, Aiken wimps out and sticks her with another character who has spent the length of the novel being loutish and vulgar, and who at end is redeemed in a completely unbelievable way. I felt extremely sorry for poor Susan, and I don't think that was Aiken's intent. (END SPOILER)<br />So, while it starts out promising, \\"Mansfield Revisted\\" ends badly, leaving a sour taste in the reader's mouth. I do not recommend it, especially not for Austen fans.	2002-07-01

Funny, frightening, and ultimately a deeply touching love story, this terrific little novel is perfect for young adults or intelligent pre-teens.<br />The plot, such as it can be described, concerns a young boy named Tolly who inadvertently revives a notorious murderer who has just been hanged in the village gallows. The criminal, a fearsome giant nick-named Black Jack, promptly coerces Tolly into a life of crime, very much against the will of the decently noble young man.<br />Thereafter the novel builds steam as Jack and Tolly meet up with an escaped asylum inmate, join a carinval troupe, encounter various eccentrics and villians and finally witness the end of the world (well, sort off). The final thunder-bolt of an ending is almost unbearingly suspenseful and leaves the reader breathless.<br />As always, the fun of Garfield's writing is his ability to stack surprise after surprise without loosing credibilty. Despite the crazy goings-on , Garfield always makes his characters seem like real people and their development over the course of the book is complex and moving. If you enjoy intriguing stories with superb dialogue and wild plot twists, don't hesitate to buy \\"Black Jack\\". If you like this novel I also recommend Garfield's \\"The Strange Affair of Adelaide Harris\\" (which introduces one of his finest literary creations, best friends Bostock and Harris) and \\"John Diamond\\".<br />Every serious reader (and especially writers!) owe it to themselves to discover the genius of Leon Garfield, and \\"Black Jack\\" is a great place to start.	2002-06-17

I am not writing this review from the perspective of a 22 year old college student. I am writing this from the perspective of the 12 year old I was when I first came across \\"Tracy Harmon: Love Specialist\\" in my middle school library during lunch. The twelve year old me read the entire book in one sitting, and promptly stole the libraries' copy , which I still have to this day. (The theft was wildly out of character for this Miss Goodie Two-Shoes, as I never even take pencils from work, and I'm still planning to mail the book back to my old school someday. Really.)<br />The cover of my (or King Middle School's) copy says it all: A pretty brunette in a Red Sweater sits at a typewriter while a handsome , clean cut guy watches her with interest. Right away we know we're in for goofy romance.<br />The story concerns a formally chubby teenager who has lost weight responsibly after trying many crash diets and quick fix cures (The saga of Tracy's weight loss is told in the book's prequel, \\"The Girl Within\\". I haven't read it.). Now, at a healthy weight with the proper self-confidence, Tracy is beautiful and wildly popular. All the guys at her school would kill to go out with her, and she can have any one she wants, except Brent Haywood. He's different. New at the school, Brent is aloof to the point of rudeness, and shows a particular dislike for Tracy, for reasons she cannot understand. On the other hand, as one chracter puts it , \\"he, uh, stares at you a lot\\" and is forever showing up in Tracy's vicinity, to her annoyance. Thus we begin a decidedly cheesy romance, full of misunderstandings, dark secret pasts (G-Rated of course) and plenty of fun. I adored this book as a young girl; I read it until I had entire sections memorized. If you can get a copy, it will make a great gift for the right day-dreaming girl. As for me, you can be sure when I have kids they will be reading it too. And then I really do have to give it back to the library.	2002-06-04

I would have just eaten these books right up. Garfield writes beautifully and wittily, with well drawn, likable characters and intelligent dialogue. But his plots! Dear lord, the plots. \\"The Strange Affair of Adelaide Harris\\" features the classic Garfield plot structure of beginning with about a dozen characters, sending half in one direction and the other half the opposite way to gradually form a giant circle. Way leads unto zany way as the people in his decidedly eccentric world try desperately to stave off their respective fates, to no avail. The good guy gets the girl, the bad guys end up confused, and Bostock and Harris go on to \\"Night of the Comet\\", (which if memory serves is actually a prequel, but never mind). If you have never read one of Leon Garfield's loopy tales, please do so immediately. You won't regret it. And if you like \\"The Strange Affair of Adelaide Harris\\" you absolutely MUST read \\"Black Jack\\", Garfield's masterwork. Murderers, con-men, insane asylums, the end of the world- it's not be to missed.	2002-06-03

A pretty unique achievement, the book blends every bit of pirate lore, atmosphere and outright clich&eacute;s into a marvelously funny and entertaining read.<br /><br />The plot is rather difficult to explain; it follows the dashing Captain Avery as he attempts to recover a priceless treasure, sometimes helped and sometimes hindered by the roguish Colonel Blood, falling in love with Lady Vanity (who describes herself as \\"gorgeous, proud, and insufferably spoiled\\"), fighting pirates, winning battles, getting stranded, imprisoned, rescued, rescuing and virtually every other thing that has ever happened in a pirate story (including, of course \\"The Black Spot\\").<br /><br />It's all such huge fun, and Fraser's writing is so delightful, you can't go wrong. An absolute must for fans of swashbucklers (literary or cinematic). Be sure to stick around for the \\"Afterthought\\", where Fraser discusses the real life figures he placed in his story. The bit about the real Colonel Blood is by itself worth the price of the book. Recommended.<br /><br />GRADE: B+<br /><br />(If you like this book, PLEASE check out Fraser's lesser known \\"The General Danced at Dawn\\". It's even better.)	2001-11-11

I think there are some stories that are innately fascinating and thus difficult to retell poorly, and the Robin Hood legend is one of them. But that said Robin McKinley's heart-stirring \\"Outlaws of Sherwood\\" deserves full accolades. You've never heard the legend quite like this.<br /><br />The basics are the same, closely following many of the stories in Howard Pyle's classic version. Young Robin accidentally kills a King's Forester, and is forced to live in beautiful, dense Sherwood Forest as an outlaw, eventually drawing many of the oppressed to him to form an outlaw band. But in McKinley's world Robin is not the superlative archer, that honor belongs to Maid Marian (girl power!) and their quiet, desperate romance is the heart of story. Intertwined with their tale is the love of Cecily, a noblewoman disguised as a boy, and right-hand-man Little John.<br /><br />Two compelling love stories, thrilling tales of adventure, terrific dialogue and a beautiful melancholy make this Robin Hood the very best I have ever read. One of the most wonderful stories I have come across, and heartily recommended.<br /><br />GRADE: A+	2000-12-07
