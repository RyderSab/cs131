She's an NYPD \\"Special Crimes\\" Detective, who makes her own rules, takes no hostages, and can make you believe she'd kill for her own sense of justice.<br />~ * ~ Mallory was taken in at age 10 ?? by an NYPD cop, who found her as a tough street kid, apparently a \\"throwaway\\". In earlier novels she is eerily without the type of \\"consicence\\" we recognize though we can sympathize with her ruthless pursuit of justice, especially in avenging her foster father's death.<br />In the novel, \\"Stone Angel\\", we learned a little about how she came to live on the New York streets.<br />In this story we learn more about her life on the streets, when a prostitute is found hanged at an arson scene. Riker, Mallory<BR>s partner, a friend of Mallory's father, recognizes the victim as a woman who once gave sporadic shelter and comfort to Mallory as a child. <br />Mallory has a score to settle with the victim, but she is no less driven to find the killer, terrorizing firefighters and rookie detectives,and walking right over supervising officers's command.<br />This entry was wonderful for the haunting, yet strangely compelling back story of that illuminates the child Kathy's quest for a  sense \\"home\\" and \\"comfort\\" with the prostitutes, drug dealers, and theives on the streets. <br />Supporting cast Detective Riker, and genius consultant Charles Butler are written very well, and their dedication to a strange blend of love, healthy fear, and protectiveness of Mallory is just wonderful.<br />I recommend \\"Stone Angel\\" as a companion to the story, together, they offer a wonderful portrait of our herione.	2003-07-20

I loved this book as a girl, and still have my mother's copy. I've just introduced my nieces to the story, and they love it too.<BR>    This story has everything that's essential in a great children's book.

There are mysteries to be solved, the voice crying at night, the locked garden with no key.<BR> The story of how Mary comes to be happy, along with the blooming of the neglected garden, and the saving of a father and son relationship, is wonderfully told.  The characters are delightfully described, from Martha, Mary's \\"maid\\", to the mysterious Colin, imperial as a rajah, when he needs to be.<BR> This is one of the few books that will help ease the \\"dry\\" spells between the releases of the Harry Potter books.	2002-10-26

It's utterly absorbing, and the characters will evoke strong reactions- like or dislike, sometimes both!

She was deaf.  This was more than a \\"handicap\\"- it became a battleground for her, between the students who wanted her to become part of the \\"Deaf\\"- not trying to \\"fit in\\" by reading lips, etc; and her father, who tried to minimize her deafness- asking her to fit in with his life.  ~ <br />~ * ~, Elizabeth George is always strong in characterizations.  She fills her story with complex characters, each of whom have weaknesses that we can sympathize with, and their own selfish and unpleasant motives.  The conflicts between the characters are so well plotted; we are drawn into the story completely.  <BR>~ * ~ Unlike most of her mysteries, I started to see the conclusion.

She has a very small role in this story.  However, we do come to know Inspector Lynley's other assistant, Winston Nkata, who does have an interesting and difficult role in the story.  Tommy Lynley also, is facing some changes in his personal life. <br /> This story focuses less on the detectives than many of the others in the series.  Most of the story is seen through the eyes of a member of the family close to the crime.  A young violinist, who has had a career as a prodigy, is suddenly unable to play.  He is searching his soul and his memory for reasons for this block. He unearths much more than he expected, the history of a death in his family when he was just a child.  Does he remember anything about it?  Or are the faint memories that begin, and he clings to, as much fabrication as the stories he's been told?  This becomes critical has murder strikes his family again, now in the present.<br /> ~  ~ This George mystery is much more focused on an individual close to the crime than the others in the series.  In this respect, it is more like  \\"Playing for the Ashes\\" than more recent novels. <BR> While less focus on the detectives was a little disappointing to me as a Havers fan, this was still a fascinating story.  As always, her strength is in showing the complexity of the best and worst of human motives.  She fills her stories with people we would love to hate, if they weren't so uncomfortably human, and full of some of the same faults we could find in ourselves.  All in all, an absorbing read.  5 stars *****!	2002-10-13

There is usually enough sense of danger in the magical adventures to make them suspenseful, without being too frightening.

A young woman, alienated from her family, who is writing a journal, narrates most of the story.  We understand from the beginning that her tale will somehow come to reveal important information about the death of a Cricket star, Kenneth Fleming.<BR>Although, in the beginning, her story seems to have little to do with the murder, it is still the fascinating tale of her life. It is very intense and gritty reading about the wrongs committed by her mother and herself.  She certainly doesn't paint herself in a rosy light. <BR> It's only because she has reached some maturity of understanding, that we can dislike the actions she took in the past, and still have sympathy for her in the present.<br />  ~  -  ~  Inspector Tommy Lynley and Sergeant Barbara Havers are investigating the murder.

Most of the characters seem like stereotypes.  There is the wealthy husband who doesn't really understand his wife.  Upstairs lives the Au Pair - a young Dutch woman apparently only interested in her sex life.  The housekeeper and gardener speak nothing but praise of their employer.  The young under-gardener worships the \\"Lady of the House\\", and believes she's promised him help in his wish for a career as a DJ and a singer.  Her brother is a neurotic scholarly writer who dislikes his sister.  Her sister-in-law may benefit from the will.<br />~ - ~The book is entertaining, but not nearly as absorbing as Rendell's usual.  You may be able to guess the killer and motive.  The ending was a surprise to me, but not nearly as powerfully surprising as Ruth Rendell's usual twists and turns.  Inspector Wexford hardly did any inspecting, mostly listening to a narrative from a friend of the family.  Even just listening to the tale of the family's history seemed to take an inordinately long time- 3 or 4 days of conversations.<br />~ - ~ This book is entertaining, and easy to get interested in.

The cast of the \\"Baker Street Irregulars\\" includes amateur detectives with some strikingly similar styles to some of the top detectives in Mystery fiction at the time (set in the 1940's). <br />~ ~ After the obligatory obnoxious and odious character is murdered, there is naturally a nice damsel in distress whose name needs to be cleared. Each of the amateur detectives (all members of the Sherlock Holmsian exclusive club), seizes upon a slightly different bit of evidence and goes off on their own private investigative track, each coming up with wildly different results. <BR> Each of these sections in narrated in a style closer to the different authors that created each detective. The result is just wonderful for anyone who's read enough mysteries to recognize at least 3 or 4 detectives. Any that you don't recognize specifically will be recognizable by type.<br />~ ~ I lost my copy of this book a long time ago, probably lending it out to other mystery lovers. I was so thrilled to see this listing at Amazon[.com], that I not only had to write a review, I'm putting it in my shopping cart immediately for my next purchase. I can't wait to reread it.<br />~ ~ Maybe the best thing about the book is that while Boucher, a talented critic himself, is mocking other detectives, it is very clear that he himself has enjoyed reading tales of these beloved detectives himself.

He becomes over involved with the boy's mother.

The book was very strong in the characterizations of the principal players, not just Burden and Wexford, but also the boy's mother, who clings to hope when it looks grim. Grace, Burden's sister-in-law is also very believable and understandable, as she suffers through the pain of Burden's family, who need his focus back at home.<br /> ~ ~ \\"No More Dying, Then!\\" is absorbing and captivating.

I was desperate for anything in English to read and resorted to my mother's paperback mystery collection.  I was so excited and intrigued by this story, that it started me on a Mystery book addiction, now going on 32 years worth of mystery reading. <BR>~ ~ - ~ ~<BR>       I remember the chill down my spine at the intricacy and \\"rightness\\" of the solution to the mystery.  The story is very simple.  Agatha Christie's sleuth Miss Marple has been sent on a vacation to the Caribbean, supposedly to relax, by her wealthy nephew.  She meets an interesting group of fellow travelers at her hotel, and watches them carefully.  A retired Military gentleman is ruffling the other guests feathers in his blunt way, and is with a group that includes most all of them when he is suddenly very upset by something he has seen or heard.  When he becomes the victim of murder, Miss Marple must deduce what it was that had affected him so, in order to find the killer. <BR>~ ~ - ~ ~<BR>     This is a wonderfully entertaining example of the \\"Classic\\" mystery, with a fixed group of suspects, a circumscribed location, and a wonderful sleuth to follow.  I like Helen Hayes in the movie adaptations of Miss Marple.  She seems as endearing, and as seemingly muddle headed, shy, and retiring as the Miss Marple of the story.  <BR>This book follows the unwritten rules that the clues were there all along, but you just don't see them, until the case solution is revealed.<BR>On reading the solution to this neatly done mystery, I felt that spine tingling sensation- and it remains the standard that I use to judge the success of a mystery.<BR> ~ ~ - ~ ~<BR> You don't have to be new to mystery stories to enjoy this light, easily read, entertaining book.

We have had good luck with the \\"Klutz\\" series, and this kit was no exception. <BR>~ - ~<BR>   The Polish that comes with the kit is easily peeled off.  This can be an advantage or disadvantage, depending on your point of view.  It does make changing the nail fashions quicker and easier.  The polish was a good consistency for nail artwork, but any good cosmetic brand of nail polish will work.<BR>~ - ~<BR>   The real bonus here was the inspiring book of designs, which contained easy-to- follow instructions for decorating nails with whimsical designs.  There were ideas for the American Flag, paw prints, ladybugs, flowers, holiday designs and many, many more.  My favorite was this adorable little \\"optical illusion\\" snake which seems to be crawling across your toes, when you paint it using all 5 toenails!<BR>For preteens, especially artistically inclined girls, this kit was a great source of entertaining ideas.<BR>~ - ~<BR>   I definitely recommend it.  It's very good for ages 9-13.  Kris loved receiving it for her birthday, and she even gets to use it sometimes, when Amanda isn't busy studying the book for new ideas!	2002-10-03

(But I still don't know what the heck happened to Katjie!)- These complaints refer to \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" and \\"V\\".<BR>~ - ~ - ~<BR>.....Luckily for us, \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\" is the exception, and a great book. <BR>The surface story is clear, and relatively easy to follow. Oedipa Maas finds herself appointed executrix of the estate of a wealthy former lover, in Southern California. <BR>After a series of bizarre coincidences, and meetings with what must be some of the most eccentric characters on earth, she begins to discern a series of \\"clues\\". These signs may be pointing to the existence of a vast conspiracy sweeping the city, state, and or Nation. <BR>Alternatively, they may be the manifestations of her own mental breakdown into paranoia. Or possibly an elaborate joke left behind by the deceased.<BR>~ - ~ - ~<BR>...... The beauty of this book is in how we are drawn into the web along with Oedipa, seeing the connections, pondering their meaning.... until we are certainly feeling as paranoid as she.<BR>I found this book very readable and entertaining, unlike other Pyncheon novels like \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" which is exhausting to try to read. <BR>~ - ~ - ~<BR>..... If you've heard of Pyncheon, or just want a sample of a great 20th century writer, this is definitely the book I'd recommend. It is entertaining and satisfying, as well as thought provoking. <BR>You could listen to educated readers debate the merits of different works by Pyncheon. I suggest you not waste your time. Instead, take a look at this book.	2002-10-02

The story revolves around Sgt Havers this time, and all you need to know is that her previous case was physically and emotionally traumatic.<BR>* * *<BR>    If you are a Havers fan, this is the book for you, absolutely. She has finally done all the difficult things needed to find herself some peace of mind; finding a place to live for herself, and arranging for her elderly mother's care. Unfortunately, she still feels guilty at her sense of relief.<BR>* * * *<BR>   It's a tribute to George's skill as a writer, that Barbara, who manages to alienate almost everyone else, still is a character we cheer for and have come to love. She meets two engaging neighbors, a little girl and her separated, but not yet divorced father; who are Pakistani. Despite herself, she is drawn to the girl's unreserved affectionate and cheerful personality, and also to the girl's father, who is a little mysterious. <BR>* * * * * <BR>    When they are called away to assist distant relatives with a police problem, irrepressible Barbara can't help but interfere a little. She calls on a favor from an old friend, now risen in the ranks, and is assigned to help in the investigation of the death of a recent immigrant. George weaves the web around us so masterfully; we don't see the deception that blinds us, too. It is hard to describe the power of this book without ruining g the dramatic final scenes.<BR>* * * * * *<BR>I can say that Havers comes into her own, in this story. She may not have been wise to involve herself in the investigation, but she shows unexpected strength and resolve in following through. If you, like me are a Havers fan, and don't mind a little time away from Lynley and his friends, this book is truly wonderful. It is definitely the Barbara Havers story of the series and a terrific mystery, too.	2002-09-17

This story is on the lighter side.  The unusual twist is that Pascoe himself is forced to wonder whether, by driving under the influence, Dalziel has corrupted the investigation.  The story ties together the threads of 3 different deaths on the same night.  A newer character, Detective-Constable Seymour, assists Pascoe and Sgt Wield in the investigation. The  completely clueless and luckless Constable Hector manages to hinder most of the help Seymour is providing. The story has some very funny moments despite the tragedy of the deaths of the three elderly victims. As always it is great when Mrs. Ellie Pascoe is a part of the story. And she is \\"present\\" in this one, although she's physically away, taking care of her own elderly father.  The mystery is satisfying and the reader's natural suspicion of Dalziel's motives, and maybe even his integrity, actually enhances the plot.  Well done. <br />~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~<br />(For a sampling of the haunting, deeper side of Reginald Hill's Dalziel/Pascoe stories try \\"On Beulah Height: or \\"The Wood Beyond\\".)	2002-09-17

For Fans of Martha Grimes Inspector Jury, and Melrose Plant-This isnt a part of that series.<BR>But don't miss it. It is definitely preferable to read Hotel Paradise first, this is a sequel, and assumes knowledge from the prior book. You could read it alone, but I think it would become frustrating. The best is to read them together. <BR>***This is not a classic who-dun-it*****<BR>In fact, we're barely sure of the details of the crime itself, or the long ago events that caused it. This is the story of a (lonely-though I doubt she'd describe herself that way)-12 year old girl's mission to decipher the meaning of a recent crime, and to discover its connection to crimes or sins commited long ago. It builds on the mystery she (mostly) deciphered in \\"Hotel Paradise\\".<BR>This book is wonderful. Not only are the old and new mysteries hauntingly engaging, but Emma's journey to decipher them made me laugh and cry at how well it describes what it's like to be 12. Not yet accepted as an adult, but old enough to have the persistence and ingenuity to get help from the adults who can help her investigate, while pretending to be nonchalantly wandering, just like a child. Emma made me remember what it was like to almost believe, that if you didn't stare at someone, they  wouldn't notice you. She is precocious, but very realistic and likeable. Sheriff Sam DeGheyn,even seen through her critical eyes, is obviously wonderfully kind, caring and intelligent man. <BR>she finds help from unlikely allies, finally coming to a resolution, that is wonderful, solving unanswered questions from \\"Hotel Paradise\\" as well.<BR>Again: don't expect a \\"Jury and Plant\\" story-<BR>but you'll get something rare and precious.	2002-09-07

Wield has suffered through plenty of Dalziel's bossiness and the dismay of \\"coming out\\" to his fellow detectives.

They've created a unique type story (series) that Adults and young children can enjoy together actively. This would be a delightful tale with deliciously detailed illustrations on its own. What makes this so wonderful is the placing of \\"illustrated clues\\" to the solution of the mystery (a theft at the title Wedding) throughout the illustrations. The pictures themselves are intricate and beautiful, it is a pleasure to review them over and over to spot the little details missed on the first read through. The girls liked this best at ages 5-8 but everyone, from baby Ben at age 3 to Nana at age 67 loved to participate. For a treat to pamper yourself (hopefully with a child at your side to help you spot any significant details you might miss), or as a gift to any family with young children who treasure a good read- I would recommend this book most highly. If you haven't read the original \\"Piggins\\"- be sure to put it in your shopping cart too!	2002-05-31

The author does a wonderful job of first enticing us into the plot and then shifting back to consider whether the quest for vengeance itself is really such a good idea even in the face of the enormity of the crime, as no-one involved can emerge unscathed.

As an avid reader, I judge the success of a story by whether the solution, as it is revealed, raises the hair on the back of my neck and send shivers down my spine, not in fear, but in appreciation of just how inevitable and &quot;right&quot; the solution is to the puzzle.

The one survivor is now a successful singer who must struggle to search within herself for long forgotten memories to help Dalziel and Pascoe prevent another tragedy. When the pieces fall into place, it is like a kaleidoscope that suddenly spins into sharp focus and you wonder how you missed the picture right up until the point when all becomes clear.

The children can certainly enjoy the basic story of Miss Spider's search for a suitable mate, but only adults will appreciate the tongue in cheek humor as the insect world is revealed to have many social similarities with our own. If the insect world had a \\"Jane Austen\\" it would be Miss Spider. <BR>   There is a happy ending as usual with children's stories, but there was one page of conflict that the girls (at ages 6 & 7) found \\"scary\\"- I was initially surprised, but its true that all the kids I've read this to (ages 5-8) found the big dramatic moment (Miss Spider's suitor turns out to be a little too pushy) a little intense.<BR>    The dashing (yet meek and mild) hero soon sets things right, however and the kids all enjoy the pictures of the wedding preparations. This one is not for easily frightened kids, although I originally thought it was unlikely to frighten anyone.<br /> This book is really for adults to enjoy on an entirely different level while children are entertained by the beautiful pictures and happy resolution.	2002-05-30

The eccentric and mysterious women who fall in and out of Jury's life; as well as the colorful Long Piddleton cast of characters.  ~~Maybe most of all I've enjoyed the way they interact with the children who appear in many stories as central characters, either with essential information, or in danger and need of protection, unwanted as it may be.  Jury's skillful, and Plant's reluctant interviewing techniques are often highlights of the story. <BR>~I have always relied on Grimes to preserve these kids and other \\"likeable\\" characters from harm, and she has done so.<BR>In this book, I feel she doesn't quite keep to that unwritten promise.  Don't worry I'm not giving anything away: right from the start the history of a tragedy appears.  One of the central mysteries of this story is the tragic drowning death of two children from the cliffs outside their home.<BR>~When the spotlight of the story sticks to the \\"current\\" mysteries in this seaside town, (the murder of a former servant, the inexplicable disappearance of a reliable local businesswoman), this is an entertaining and interesting Grimes story. <BR>~Jury fans may be disappointed, but this story really belongs to Melrose and to Brian Macalvie, the local CID chief who is willing to drive himself into the ground in pursuit of justice. <BR>~The resolution of all the mysteries seems a little far-fetched, but I would have been willing to suspend disbelief.  The one part that disturbed me greatly was the dark and horrible solution to the death of the children.<BR>~~~~ A good read for fans of Melrose and Jury, but those who love children may want to skip the last scene entirely- I believe it adds unnecessarily gruesome detail to an already dark and disturbingplot twist.	2002-05-30

A Murder occurs during a nurses training demonstration. From that moment, you will be committed to the story. This story is a wonderful classic British who-dun-it. But it is so much more than that. Like all P.D. James novels, you'll find yourself caught up by the characters as layer by layer their good and bad intentions are revealed. The author never designs her novels with cardboard characters. Each player is complex, usually with faults, but so human and fallible, they are never one dimensional villians. This book stands out among all of her novels for two reasons. One is the atmosphere she creates, the claustrophic tense nurses training house, surrrounded by storms, driving rain, and falling tress. This all contributes to the high tension maintained throughout. The second reason is the mystery's solution. One of her most shocking and intense endings This is an outstanding book. If youre lucky...read it while snowed in with the phone lines down, and refuse to let the world outside interrupt theis intense and wonderful reading experience.	2002-04-03

James fan, I would say this is even a step above her usual fascinating, exquisitely crafted stories! <BR> Beautifully written and carefully plotted as usual. <BR>This book is notable for the wonderful glimpses into the life of Dalgliesh's Sgt.: Kate Miskin. These personal moments dont distract, but further the story,  and converge with the mystery plot to create a moving and exciting climax.<br />   James always creates characters who are complex and beautifully described, but in this book she outdoes herself. She has created a rainbow of personalities ranging from the most endearing to the most odious characters. <BR>      In brief, a well-crafted, imaginative, wonderfully absorbing mystery. Only caveat would be a fairly bloody crime scene encountered by the detectives. Hopefully this wont put you off, as James never throws in gratuitous gore or violence.        This was my absolute favorite P.D. James novel. If youve heard the authors name, and want to see if you like her without starting \\"at the beginning\\": This is a great choice.<BR> In short: If you love mysteries, and dont own this book- RUN, dont walk to the \\"add to shopping cart\\" link!<br />3/5/02 edited 3/19/02	2002-03-19

Melrose Plant (the main protagonists, are becoming more complex and more human as Grimes adds layers of depth but the characters development is tied to the effect of their experiences in previous books. This is wonderful for a fan of the series. However, a newcomer to the series may be confused by references to names and events from prior stories. This adds to the character continuity and depth, but makes it necessary for a new reader to go back and start with earlier books.
