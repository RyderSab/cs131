If you're surrounded by Christians, and your idea of an outreach is a potluck?  This book isn't for you, but if you're willing to go out into the world, and embrace people who have sinful lives, and sinful pasts?  You'll get it.  Rob Bell doesn't change the Gospel, he's saying that Christianity must morph to be relevant.  If you're still playing the organ?  Chances are you're not aware of the fact that kids today are having rainbow parties.<br /><br />Jesus ate with the sinners, and that's what Rob preaches. THe Gospel is offensive, but we as Christians, don't have to be.	2005-08-04

This book shows us why, what kind of characteristics make a guy worth dating, and how to listen to those little red flags that make Wickham look so good.  This is a very fun read, even if you are married!  But I will be keeping it for my daughter to study as she gets older.<br /><br />Sarah has taken all the elements of Pride and Prejudice that we love, and put them in a heartfelt, wonderfully practical book.	2005-06-16

Call me stupid, call me ignorant, I don't care, just don't make me read anymore Faulkner!!!!  I love English lit, but I'm embarrassed that as Americans we call this literature.  SNORE!!!  The people are so desperate, the themes so desolate, I can't imagine who enjoys this type of novel.  Why do some people think a novel should be painful???  If you've had a deep and moving experience with this book, hey, I won't fault you, but it feels like Faulkner loves to show off with his mastery of the English language, but story takes a backseat.<br /><br />Anyway, I feel like an idiot for buying this boxed set, and falling for the Oprah promo.  Give me Hardy, give me Austen, give me Dumas, Tolstoy -- English, French, Russian, whatever, only spare me American \\"lit\\".  This was my last Oprah pick, and I started an online group of ten women, NONE of us finished the set.  We are all educated, all lovers of books.  If you like this, great, but if you're looking for a summer of reading, look somewhere else unless you have an excess of prozac with you.	2005-06-15

Martha Beck has an engaging style and a sharp attention to detail.  For the record, I thought Martha portrayed her in-laws with love and dignity.  What I remember about her mother-in-law from the book was that she was beautiful, a lovely person who loved her son no matter what.  Where is the scandal in that?<br /><br />The fact is the Mormon religion has a lot of holes in it, so there are going to be angry people when someone pokes at them.  But Martha's book is filled with intellectual truth as SHE sees it.  This is HER story.  Sure, it may be different from others, but write your own book if you want to write YOUR truth.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a great read with a lot of insight and wisdom.  I wish Martha the best as she continues on her journey.	2005-06-03

Once in a while, a great children's book comes along that gives you the parents as much joy in reading it as the kids get in hearing it.  This is that kind of book!  The artwork is incredible, and the story darling, completely couching the \\"moral\\" in good, clean hilarity.  May your children give you plenty of \\"pirate kisses\\" after buying them this book.<br /><br />I saw the cover of this book and had to bring it home.  My children are getting to old for these books, but their Mama isn't!	2005-04-12

I can't believe some of the reviews I'm reading here.  As an author, when I read this book to my children, it literally depressed me because I wished I had done it.  I loved the way she put it all together, the deep characterization and natural longings of those on the outside.  It was just beautiful, inspirational, not to mention a great springboard for discussions with your children.  My boys are 10, 9, 6 and they were rapt with attention.  They don't even care that much about the pictures (which is amazing) because they have created their own in their mind.<br /><br />I thought this story was an incredible allegory of wanting more and striving for better.  Highly recommended! Kristin Billerbeck	2005-02-16

This is an incredible book on plot, James Scott Bell uses visuals and easy-to-read graphics that really brought plot to a level of understanding!

My nannies were always part of the family.  When we took them on vacation, they got a vacation!!  But we gave up that lifestyle, and what a confirmation this book was, that the executive lifestyle is just not enjoyable!<br /><br />I totally understood how the mother felt overwhelmed over nothing, because the less you do, the more inept you get!  You're so busy trying to be the \\"perfect\\" wife, you end up being a crappy mother.  I think this is a must-read for anyone considering employing a nanny.<br /><br />Always be mom.  A nanny is an extra set of hands, but should never replace Mom.  I know the Nanny was softest on the dad, but often, the dad is the main problem because a wealthy man gets everything he wants at work, and expects work to be his castle, without conflict.  Well, good luck with a bunch of kids!<br /><br />I also really enjoyed how the nanny was honest about her screw-ups and antics, which were hilarious and yet frightening if she got caught.  Very fun read, enjoyed it all!	2004-12-16

Marian Keyes is more than just a novelist, she is an incredible reader of people and offers insight into the writer's world.  I loved this book, and it makes me love her novel writing more to know how open she is about her insecurities and her fears.  This book proves that Ms. Keyes can write anything and make it interesting, because she herself is interesting!	2004-12-08

While it doesn't have the sparkle of some of her books, there's still no one who brings characters to the table like Maeve.  She's a master!<br /><br />I still think it would be impossible to read half this book and not find out what happens in the end, so as far as I'm concerned, that's a great read.  There's far too many books that are all plot, and I could care less if the heroine lives or dies.  I ALWAYS feel for Maeve's characters, and that is a gift, she will always have.  It's been too long since her last book, and I'm glad to see her return!  I loved the different setting too.	2004-10-31

The humor is often very subtle, and my kids got it.  We had such a great time reading this, and I would have to say if they didn't want to finish it, I would have read it myself.  The pictures were wonderful, and made it fun for my six year old.<br /><br />An enjoyable ride.  I highly recommend for both kids and adults.	2004-09-29

It's about so much more than the cover implies: family relationships, deep wounds, love of those around you, and yet all told in humorously REAL form.  There are a few chick lit authors who have the ability to delve deep into your psyche, and still make you laugh and have a good time.  I think this author is there, and has a long future ahead of her.  YAY!  She's a humorous Maeve Binchy!	2004-07-27

Whenever an author writes more than one book, there's the inevitable comparison to the others.  However, I thought this book was fabulously written and charmingly witty.  And it stands on its own.  Granted, I haven't read Rachael's Holiday (but I will because I loved this one!)  I loved the character being compared to plain yogurt at room temperature.  Which of us hasn't felt that way?  And doesn't that one sentence tell you a mint of information?  Marian Keyes deserves her kudos for a fabulous book.  I can't wait to read more.	2004-06-22

Romantic Suspense has a way of having cardboard characters in dire circumstances.  Colleen Coble doesn't write those kind of books.  Her characters are so real, they practically jump into your heart and there's so much going on in the storyline, it's extremely hard to put down.  I loved how she pulled me into the &quot;mommy&quot; side of Bree and just kept me up all night turning pages.	2004-05-29

She took a completely unlikeable heroine, and had you rooting for her by the end.  IT was very Bell Jar, in the sense that this heroine is &quot;not all there&quot; but it was a fun read, and a sick look at a society where the men are rated on their bank accounts, and women by their looks.

She doesn't seem to like her children, she treats her husband abhorantly, and her crises are self-made!  (I mean, really, the kid doesn't need a Teletubbies cake, he needs his Mommy at home from her business travel!) Life as a working mother is hectic, but this woman made herself a victim.  Also the story seems to be missing.  Buy the Nanny Diaries -- it's better.	2002-11-19

For example, the women refer to all the sexual scenes very manlike (parts is parts).  I don't know many women who refer to their breasts as tits, nor do I know many women who would describe the mechanics of sex over the emotions.  This needed to be edited by a woman to balance out the truth of the characters.  Franzen's grasp of language is incredible, but he needs to get out more and meet some decent people to write about.  I was actually rooting for all of them to be killed off.  : )	2002-01-11

In a world where love is so temporary and based on emotions, this book is about the old-fashioned REAL kind of love.  The kind where a guy would lay down himself for you!  And in this case TWO men.
