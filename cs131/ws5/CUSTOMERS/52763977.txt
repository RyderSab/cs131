Like so many embattled exploiters, they have responded to criticism and revelations with mud-slinging campaigns and lies, such as NIMH's estimate that they needed 200-300 chimpanezees a year to continue research vital to human health. At the same time, NIMH had access to more than 100 chimps, and was only able to find uses for 25 of them.<br /><br />Peterson and Goodall have taken the productive path: honesty without invective or confrontation. This has allowed Jane Goodall to accomplish small but significant changes, but they are far too small and far too trivial. It would be nice if Dr. Robert Gallo would agree to be locked into a 5x5x7 cage, with a grate at the bottom so he would not find himself smeared with all his feces, but nothing to protect him from the blowflies his stench would draw. Welcome to medical research, Bobbo.<br /><br />Human beings have a history of declaring those it would exploit to be \\"lesser creations\\": Jews, Negros, Indians, Gypsies, the harmless primates we have nearly exterminated. When the \\"lesser creations\\" are human, they can speak out to protest, and they are heard. Someone else must speak for the chimpanzees mutilated in research labs, the orangutans brutalized to entertain Las Vegas drunks, the gorillas slaughtered so their children can be confined in zoos.<br /><br />The next time you see *The Tempest,* imagine Caliban turning on Prospero, with his complacent human superiority, and speaking the extraordinary and powerful words of Shylock: \\"Hath not a beast eyes? Pricked do we not bleed?\\" Animals are bleeding to make your mascara safe. Read this book, look long at the orphaned chimp huddled in one of the photos, and then look in the mirror.	2005-06-27

If half the essays are interesting, you are doing pretty well. And there's always at least one that is a total waste of time.<br /><br />This is the exception we hope for. There is not a page of the book that doesn't either illuminate an exciting idea, provide a useful fact, or suggest a promising course of action. Every sort of thing is here from the course-defining DNC speech of Barack Obama to a list of topics you could hook Letters to the Editor on for various holidays. (Mother's Day? Social Security, Medicare, Parenting.)<br /><br />The book is divided into three sections and ten topics. The first section analyzes what has happened. It asks some hard questions, like what it might cost us to adopt Conservative means to our Liberal ends (\\"Fighting Dirty\\"). There is a handful of tough essays in here, like Michael Lerner's on Liberal contempt for the electorate (which is significantly different from, though no bigger than, Conservative contempt for the electorate). But the overall message is one of hope and optimism. The last section emphasizes organizing and suggests ways to do it.<br /><br />This book and George Lakoff's Don't Think of an Elephant (also from Chelsea Green) will pay for themselves in a few hours. We got angry; now it's time to get active. Start Making Sense will provide some direction.	2005-05-03

Turley's book is the official public Mormon version of the sordid story of Mark Hofmann's brilliant double cross forgeries. To read balanced accounts, check out Salamander and, more recently, The Poet and the Murderer.<br /><br />When reading an LDS version of this story, you must remember that Gordon Hinckley, eventually elevated to Prophet, earned his chops as Hofmann's bag man. That is to say, he spearheaded the Church's effort to purchase forgeries they thought were authentic, because if they were it would discredit the Church. Let me try that again: Hofmann was not selling believable forgeries that strengthened the Church, he was selling documents they thought were real, documents that revealed the sordid origins of their organization.<br /><br />What Hofmann did was horrible, characteristic, and even predictable. He chose his target brilliantly. And Turley's other moment of fame is his denunciation of Jon Kracauer's \\"anti-Mormon\\" Under the Banner of Heaven, the \\"anti-Mormonism\\" of which consists in telling \\"faith-damaging truths.\\" It's hard to feel sympathy for an organization so transparently built on lies that it will pay millions to suppress forged \\"truth.\\"	2005-04-30

Vidal was invited to speak on a morning news show from his home in Italy, regarding McVeigh. When he raised the question, in the interview, of McVeigh's motives, ABC's resident expert interrupted him and when Vidal wouldn't shut up, they \\"lost the feed.\\" Vidal reports that the soundman in Italy said, \\"The feed was fine. They cut you off.\\"<br /><br />Anyone familiar with Vidal's fine and not very friendly Empire novels tracing the history of the US (Burr, Lincoln, 1876, Empire, etc.) knows that the press has never been the \\"protector of truth\\" we grandly apostrophize and our Constitution sanctifies. They are, as a group, a lying sack of corporate shills, a propaganda machine for the wealthy, pimps to the powerful. And not especially amusing. They ar not \\"liberal media\\" or \\"rightwing flacks,\\" but ethikless jackals panting behind the tigerish plutocrats who toss them scraps.<br /><br />We are at the mercy of our government and the media is rapidly becoming the voice of that government as the government becomes more nakedly and directly the swinging arm of corporate America, which has vastly more \\"rights\\" than you do. This is the warning in Vidal's book. Not only are you losing your freedom, but that fact is being kept from you. Read this book, and pray for your children.	2005-04-24

Portraying Jesus as a \\"booster,\\" a kind of successful Willy Loman, is about as ludicrous as picturing Mother Teresa as a fashion model and Gandhi as a comic book superhero. The Jesus of the New Testament would have observed the conspicuous consumption of corporate America, the cultural gluttony of the Western World, with sadness and disgust.<br /><br />Jesus may be the ultimate Rorschach. We look at him: Nazis see a blue-eyed Aryan beset by Jews and look for somebody to beat up; gays see their lifestyle affirmed in the friendhip with John; chickenhawk warriors somehow see endorsement of the hateful causes they want others to die for; the tenderhearted and compassionate see him surrounded by happy children; feminists see the women by his side; lying hypocrites see... God knows what.<br /><br />The hardest thing for humans to do is to comprehend that their heroes are not just big versions of themselves. A hero should be something to push against, not a self-endorsement. Jesus told the rich to give away their money. He told his followers not to gather up treasures in the world. He said wealth is a burden that will keep the rich out of Heaven. He scourged the moneylenders. He was a freeloader. He is bad for business.<br /><br />Today, as the most affluent country on the planet, we hear the Christian message as unhappily as the young wealthy Hebrew who asked Jesus what he must do to be saved. His answer was NOT \\"get an MBA.\\" But instead of walking away, we invent new myths of a  Jesus more suitable, one able to see past his silly prejudice against money grubbers, to see that it is possible to be rich and really nice.<br /><br />Barton's book is a bizarre anachronism; a last survivor of the Babbitt years of pious Philistinism and Pharisaic self-approval just before the Depression turned our complacent cultural narcissism upside down. How sad, that it's coming back into fashion. Read Jim Wallis' *God's Politics* for a theology less absorbed with self-justification.Depression turned our complacent cultural narcissism upside down.

It was worth the wait. Banks tells a truly Indian life story--it's no accident that more than half the pictures are of other people: his relations.<br /><br />Don't look for startling revelations here. We still don't know who really killed the FBI agents at Pine Ridge. And the spirit of Anna Mae Aquash should haunt Banks as he lays dying. But if you want to know how it is to grow up Indian in today's America, this is the book to start with.<br /><br />It would be great to see the University of Oklahoma Press with a deserved best seller.

It is, without a competitor, the best all-around book on Mary Magdalene. Buy Karen L. King's translation of the Gospel of Mary if you want an intense but engaging lesson in theology, Jane Schaberg's *The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene* if you want a solid feminist critique, or Margaret Starbird's *The Woman with the Alabaster Jar* if you are looking for New Age speculation, but it's Haskins who pulls it all together.<br /><br />Tracing the idea of Mary Magdalene from the Biblical (and \\"heretical\\") sources to present-day manifestations in film and novel, she provides a survey of the changing role of women and sexuality in Occidental culture, generously illustrated with depictions of the Magdalene. She shows how the \\"shamed prostitute\\" myth got its start, examines the claims of connection between Mary and France, and provides a very funny account of the Church supported habit of \\"relic snatching\\" that accounts for Mary's \\"relics\\" moving here and there from this monastery to that church.<br /><br />All in all, it is a heavy but interesting read, with no polemic axe to grind.

On the one hand, they are cleverly crafted mysteries that leave us guessing up to almost the final pages. On the other, they are explorations of the exceptional mind and, in the case of the Mallory novels, the spiritual biography of a sociopath.<br /><br />Looking back over the eight Mallory novels, typically the real murderer, and the real crime, usually turn out to be much less interesting than any number of other elements. So here. The center of *Winter House* is Kathy's confrontation with a doppelganger, Nedda Winter, a woman she could become. Is Nedda insane? Did she kill her entire family in a childhood rampage? Is she killing now? As these questions are answered, questions about Kathy Mallory are answered.<br /><br />Kathy's had a free ride for seven novels, with Riker, Charles, and the poker club making excuses for her while the reader looks on, titillated and aghast. Things changed in *Dead Famous* when Johanna Apollo said to Charles, \\"You know what she is?\\" and he nodded. Here, at last, he closes a door in her face, refuses to allow her to bully a victim, and says \\"No\\" when any sane person would. Riker and Charles have begun to demand that Kathy grow up. Whether she will, we'll see in another novel, I think.<br /><br />The first four novels were a set that appeared to complete Kathy's story. The next three took us from where she came from to who she is. *Winter House* begins to explore who she can become. Of the eight books, one of the best.	2004-11-28

How refreshing, that this little book serves as a great introduction to Lakoff's work and, most important, as an effective guidebook to entering the political debate as the underdog progressive.<br /><br />The book is practical and inspiring. What better combination could one ask for? It can be read in one sitting. It will change the way you present your own politics and help you comprehend the apparent incoherence of conservative thinking.<br /><br />Lakoff's method is simple. He asks, \\"How can good, intelligent people think these two apparently contradictory things?\\" For example: Opposition to birth control and to programs that help unwed mothers. The answers he finds are fundamental, persuasive, and they do not dismiss conservative thinking, as so many progressives do, by demonizing it.<br /><br />Get this book if you are feeling baffled and helpless going into this election. It will give you strength.	2004-10-13

Cherryh's early science fiction novels are being reissued by DAW in omnibus editions. Some of the them--The Morgaine Saga and The Faded Sun--are extraordinary bargains, because the books included are classics. At the Edge of Space is also a good deal, because Hunter of Worlds, arguably Cherryh's best novel, is worth the price of the volume. Unfortunately it is bound with what may be her first novel, the amateurish Brothers of Earth.<br />Hunter of Worlds gives you the trademark elements of Cherryh's best work: two cultures with a balanced if unequal relationship are intruded upon by a hairy, vulgar thing called a &quot;human.&quot; (He's not even empathic!) We see the action from the non-human perspective. The operatic grandness of the iduve--clannish space predators like wolf packs--contrasts with the delicate slave race (their name escapes me) mediating between human and iduve. Cultural clashes drive the action, and planets are the pawns of political intrigue.<br />Here is the best possible introduction to Cherryh. If you enjoy the politics of Hunter of Worlds, you will love the Richardsonian volumes of the Foreigner series. If you enjoy the richly imagined cultures and languages, and the conflicts that follow from them, you will enjoy the Chanur series and the Faded Sun books, in which multiple races collide over their culturally determined values. If, like me, you fall in love immediately with the extraordinary Chimele, then read the Morgaine Saga.	2003-09-07

No question, Reichs is getting better. Complaints about \\"intricate plotting\\" hint at that. Here, she weaves together four disappearances that appear to be related, and an apparently unrelated murder, then resolves all the strands quickly with only one convenient accident. And the last four sentences of the book made me laugh out loud. Some fun.<br />Reichs' forensics are rock solid and fascinating. More to the point, her characters are not cardboard grotesques, and her heroine's values extend beyond the brandname of her stemware. There is none of Cornwell's thinly veiled contempt for people who don't covet Jaguars.<br />The appearance of Tempe Brennan in a Guatemalan village was a bit of a shock, but within a few pages, it makes sense and, for its humanizing and realistic focus on one person trying to make a difference in a real political tragedy, it is a major attraction of the book. Brennan isn't out to save the world from face-peeling supervillains; she's slogging in a septic tank to protect real people from real evil.<br />Can't wait for more.	2002-07-18

His picture of LA (and the US) 40-50 years ago is, I am sure, familiar to blacks my age, and likewise strangely foreign to whites. This came home to me when I read *Bad Boy*, which brings the time forward to my own adulthood.<br />I'm a contemporary of Brawly Brown, and as I read about Easy being rousted because he sat in a car too long for a couple of white cops' taste, his honest and hardworking friends scrabbling to keep a few steps ahead of poverty in a city that sounds like the first circle of Hell, all the intellectual platitudes of the Civil Rights Movement become vivid realities.<br />Mosley's corrupt, racist LA of the Sixties is no surprise. But he makes it real in a way coffehouse conversation can't, and he communicates his moral outrage the best way possible, by letting us do it for him.<br />It's an odd comparison, but Mosley reminds me of Tony Hillerman in his essentially moral perspective and his commitment to teaching in the attractive guise of adventure.	2002-07-16

Lucia St. Clair Robson is a bit of a mystery, in that her books have an air of &quot;historical romances&quot; about them which is nothing more than a clever disguise for some of the best historical fiction being written these days. *Ghost Warrior* is up to her best standards, likely to become a classic just as *Ride the Wind* has.<br />It is, first and foremost, a love story with a wonderful twist. Never, as you read this book, can you imagine a resolution that will put Rafe and Lozen together. And yet they are in love, perhaps from the moment they meet. Wisely, Robson doesn't turn that into a lengthy demonstration of the unfairness of life. Avoiding sentimental what-ifs, she keeps the dynamic of their growing relationship at the center of the action.<br />While that relationship is the personal center of the novel, the historical center is the story of the destruction of the Apache people. Again, the PW fellow gets it wrong. Robson is not doing &quot;good guys/bad guys&quot; with the PC emphasis on demonizing whites. The Apaches of her novel are not folks you would want for neighbors. Like the Comanches of *Ride the Wind*, they are brutal, terrifying enemies. What Robson does do is tell the truth about the times. The truth is, the white men who carried on about Indian brutality were the same ones who made tobacco pouches from the intimate skin of murdered &quot;squaws&quot; and butchered babies of color.<br />I can't say that her picture of Apache life is accurate and complete, though I'm convinced it is true to her impressive research. Her book is, after all, a historical reconstruction, and that means it is dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of the historical data. I can say that her Apaches are believeable, rounded, and sympathetic. The single most memorable thing Robson dramatizes is their sense of humor. As for Lozen, her heroics are a historical fact, and her &quot;mystic powers&quot; are carefully unplayed. Robson presents her as a brilliant, complex woman, not, like so many &quot;woman warrior&quot; books would, as a man in drag.<br />A great book? Well, no, but who said it was? Accurate history? As much as any history can be. There are few periods of the American past more shameful than &quot;the Indian wars,&quot; and if Robson's white people are less than admirable, we can console ourselves that this means they were not as noble, compassionate, and honorable as we, who would never have done that to the Indians....<br />If you like Larry McMurtry and Jame Michener, you will enjoy this book. It is better than anything Michener ever wrote, and better than any of the endless sequels to *Lonesome Dove.* It is, like *Ride the Wind*, daring in its balance, so it runs the danger of pleasing no one.d her &quot;mystic powers&quot; are carefully unplayed.

Having \\"a prizewinning, critically acclaimed literary novelist\\" write an action-packed thriller is the same sort of embarrassing schtick.<br />With the exception of mouth-breathing adolescents like James Ellroy, most writers of mystery fiction know that their work must have a moral foundation of some sort. Even someone as noir as Andrew Vachss operates in a moral world, and James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux is just as damaged as Luther Ewing but a lot more interesting. Ewing is no better than his adversaries, and he doesn't mind.<br />This novel is contemptuous of its audience. That attitude may work in the alleys on 42nd Street, but I suspect most of the book's potential readers will spot it and walk away, wary of Murphy lit. Even children can usually tell when they are being patronized, and many readers of genre lit, surprising though this may be to \\"literary novelists,\\" are not children.<br />The novel is full of bonehead problems. We are supposed to believe that Luther managed to hide a big and important chunk of his career from his employers at Baltimore PD. Ok. That he could connect up with an old friend who's now a drug runner, and the guy would never \\"notice\\" that he was a cop. Sure. That all women under 25--at least all the goodlooking ones--can't keep their hands off his aging bod.

There isn't a bad Reacher novel (*Echo Burning* is a personal favorite), and *Without Fail* is one of the good ones.<br />Given Amazon's breathless terror of \\"spoilers,\\" I won't bother with plot details. Check out the editorial reviews for that. I will say that Child does three things here that make this novel memorable. First, he creates a complex thriller plot worthy of the Clancy/Ludlum crowd. Second, he gives Reacher a love interest with great and intriguing psychological complexity and then resolves it in a way that is cruel and true. Third, he provides a thread to the personal side of Reacher's story that has potential to take the character into some new emotional territory.<br />Vague enough for ya? Read this book.	2002-06-12

Robson's novel about Cynthia Ann Parker is gussied up as a piece of historical romance, but it is a solidly researched, well-written biography of one of the most fascinating women of Texas, the mother of Comanche chief Quanah Parker. To avoid lunkhead complaints about &quot;spoilers,&quot; I can't tell you what happens to her, but in the literature of women kidnapped by Indians, her story is unique.<br />Robson does a great job of maintaining a delicate balance between the &quot;savagery&quot; of the Comanches (a horrifying massacre of the Parker family opens the novel) and the rich, positive side of their lives. She has set out to understand and communicate how a young white woman could come to regard her &quot;rescue&quot; as a second kidnapping, and she pulls it off. *The Searchers,* based on the same story, may be a greater work of art, but *Ride the Wind* has the taste and smell of truth about it.	2002-06-08

And he keeps getting better, a dozen novels into a series. The new book presents us with two violent crimes against women. Serial killer? The prime suspect is a brilliant young musician, the man you want to be the killer is a rich white kid. Hovering in the background is Burke's sleaziest, nastiest villain in years.<br />Burke never deals in cliches, though his characters might. The second victim is the daughter of a Mafia hit man, and one of the most startling and engaging elements of the story is the humanization of the grieving father. When the crimes resolve into solutions, we lose some people we care about. And one villian gets justice in a form we can only shake our heads over.<br />Robicheaux suffers a disgusting humiliation in this book, and his family is rocked by the result. I listened to another mystery writer recently ascribe the appeal of his books to the fact that his hero is a nice normal guy with a nice normal family. Well, maybe so, but Burke has gotten tremendous mileage out of something a bit more challenging. Watching Alafair grow, seeing the strength of Bootsie's love for her scarred man, feeling their pain as they cope with the literal scars of her incurable illness, have made this series the best around for a decade. Let's hope for a few more.	2002-06-08

Box is talented, but his first novel, *Open Season*, was short on the craft and skill that make first-rate reading. *Savage Run* shows him more in control of his story, and it takes us from a promising beginning to writing worthy of seasoned pros like Nevada Barr and Kirk Mitchell.<br />The plot is in the editorial reviews: Apparently, there is a pogrom against environmentalists, and Box's hero, Joe Pickett, gets drawn into the action. Box weaves together environment and Wyoming history to tell his story. You will know who the villain is early on, but Box manages some good surprises nonetheless.<br />The only quibble I have with the books is one I've seen elsewhere. Pickett is just a bit too self-effacing. A series is hard to sustain when the hero is more a victim and observer than agent of change and discovery. It's time to see Pickett grow some confidence to go with his Jimmy Stewart goodness.	2002-06-03

Box's first novel, but it was good enough to convince me to buy the second, *Savage Run*, in hardcover. Box's game warden Joe Pickett is a bit too much of a stumblebum to be endearing, and his Ozzie and Harriet family drifts dangerously close to a tiresome cliche.<br />But he pulls it off here, adding a plot detail at the end that leavens the family and giving Pickett a moment of vengeful rage that is believeable and horrifying. One wishes someone had told Box that a mongoose is not a mustelid, but most readers will slip right past that bit of faux zoology.<br />The scenery, and scene, are accurate and sometimes spectacular. The villains are a bit obvious, and the hero a bland Jimmy Stewart. But it's a good read, and *Savage Run* invites comparison to the top guns--Nevada Barr, Michael McGarrity, Kirk Mitchell, J. A. Jance.<br />Buy it in paper, a couple of evenings' entertainment.	2002-06-03

Perry is a superb craftsman, whose novels are always literate, challenging, and thoughtful. He seems to have lost interest in Jane after six novels, three of which attempt to retire her. Too bad. Even though he is right, that sustaining a character through decades is hard work and perhaps not even very interesting, she is missed.<br />Read *Vanishing Act*, *Shadow Woman*, and *Dance for the Dead*. These are the must-haves of the series. Perry manages to create a believable Seneca world while maintaining a respectful distance, and his intricate plotting sustains each book. Read for the plot, read for the Indians: either way, you'll be happy.	2002-05-24

Her new novel marches right into Steve Hamilton's staked claim, upstate Michigan/Wisconsin, looks around with its hands on its hips, and murmurs, \\"Eh, nice to be home.\\" Then she proceeds to write a contemporary mystery with the political and social details of a good Hillerman story. And James Doss, eat your heart out. Medawar's silly characters with their high school antics are genuinely funny.<br />A minor tribal official is murdered at the Red Cliff Reservation, and his wife disappears with the kids. Personal tragedy? Political assassination? Well, read it and find out. Medawar's new sleuth, Karen Charboneau, is an Ojibway potter back from the big city (Minneapolis). Her daddy, her uncle, and the chief suspect in the murder trained her to be a woodcraft genius, however, when she was a kid. So Karen ends up tracking down her buddy and mentor, four bumbling, squabbling cops in tow. Two of them have the hots for her, the third is a half-pint Casanova with the hots for everybody with ovaries, and the fourth is, well, a white boy from the city....<br />And then, in the middle of a bog, things get complicated.<br />Medawar's plot is right on the edge of slapstick, with a hit man kidnapped from *The Goonies,* and the whole tone of the story has that \\"tall tale\\" broadness to it that can be alternately engaging and infuriating. Lots of shouting and running around. But it's fun to watch, and it gives the lie to that silly stereotype that Indians don't appreciate humor. Medawar is a Cherokee living at Red Cliff, and her characters and their story ring true.<br />This is supposed to be the start of a new series. It looks like it will be good enough to comfort those of us who hoped, now that she'd found her stride with *The Fort Larned Incident*, that there would be more Tay-bodal novels.	2002-05-24

Isn't there anything else like them?\\" In this genre that combines mystery fiction with American Indian themes, Thomas Perry, with his superior writing skills and (sadly, now retired) Seneca heroine, Jane Whitefield, and Kirk Mitchell, with his rural western settings and duo of American Indian cops, are the top contenders for Hillerman's crown when the master decides to retire. (And yes, I know about Doss, the Thurlos, Stablenow, etc. Different league.)<br />*Spirit Sickness* is a PG-13 Hillerman novel with a touch of  Ellroy/Harris nastiness spicing things up. The crimes are more graphic than anything Hillerman would subject us to, and there is a bit of graphic sex as well. The villain is a violent psychopath--a type that only appears, and briefly, in one of the Chee/Leaphorn books. But the action is fast and furious, the conflict and attraction between the two cops exciting and engaging, and overall this is a solid, satisfying read.<br />For a complete discussion of the \\"Indian mystery\\" genre, check my web site.	2002-05-21

Sadly, when he returned to the series, something was lost, and the books since have felt almost as if they were being ghost-written for him.<br />*Sacred Clowns* is the last of the best of these books. Set at the fictional &quot;Hano&quot; Pueblo, it explores history, religion, and antiquities, weaving together environmental issues, intertribal rivalries, and a good, solid story with interesting characters. Chee and Leaphorn are dealing with their respective personal problems, and both stories move forward in promising ways.<br />This is not the best of the series. That honor goes to *A Thief of Time*, because Hillerman got it all right and it dazzles. It's not the most representative. That would be *Skinwalkers*, I think, and hence its selection for the first Hillerman Mystery Theatre production this fall. And it's not my favorite; that would be *Coyote Waits*, with its surprise ending that brings home the potential for tragedy on the reservation better than any mainstream novel I've read.<br />But it is a good, solid book, entertaining, educational,  densely plotted and well written. Of the books added to the series since,  the lastest, *The Wailing Wind*, finally suggests that Hillerman is getting back on track, but if you are new to this remarkable and exciting set of novels, begin with one of the three I've recommended above, then, if you like that, go back to the first or second novel and read your way forward. By the time you jump the gully of *Finding Moon*, you will be prepared to forgive some tiredness in the stories that come after.<br />Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee will be gone eventually, like Thomas Perry's wonderful Jane Whitefield. I will miss them.<br />For a complete discussion of the &quot;Indian mystery&quot; genre, check my web site.	2002-05-21

Maybe	Kirk Mitchell's three Parker/Turnipseed \\"Indian mysteries\\" are the best, for topic and local color, of the genre by any of the \\"new Tony Hillermans.\\" With Thomas Perry's apparent decision to retire Jane Whitefield, Mitchell has no serious rivals right now.<br />*The Ancient Ones* provides an interesting (and pretty shocking) mystery, with a solution that will surprise and a dynamite conclusion. It moves the personal story forward, giving us a better understanding of Anna Turnipseed's psychology and getting the two protagonists past some of their conflict.<br />Mitchell's stories are indeed a bit more graphic than Hillerman's, which is a generational thing, I think. They are certainly not particularly horrifying in the context of other writers in the genre, such as Andrew Vachss, Dennis Lehane, or Mo Hayder. The place to begin with Mitchell is the second novel, *Spirit Sickness*. If that works for you, try this one, then go back to the first novel, *Cry Dance*. Hillerman started strong and has been limping a bit in the stretch. Mitchell is growing with each book, and I'm confident the new fourth in the series will reflect that growth.	2002-05-21

Both Medawar and her hero have a great sense of fun, and this first novel in a series of four is notable for its refusal to take seriously the cliches of white attitudes toward Indians.<br />It is also an interesting and challenging mystery set in an important moment of American history, when the tribes of the southern plains were being subjugated by Civil War veterans with nothing better to do. Tay-bodal moves among the great heroes of that era--Satanta, Lone Wolf, Satank--who are for him not only great but uncles and cousins, and men with, if not feet of clay, dirty moccasins.<br />Read it for the mystery, read it for the history, read it for the fresh look at American Indians.

Larned Incident: A Tay-bodal Mystery	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Too Many Genres to Satisfy	It may be that what doomed the Tay-bodal series was the attempt to straddle three genres--mystery, American Indian, and historical. But if you haven't tried these offbeat mystery novels, you are missing a unique experience.<br />Kiowa healer Tay-bodal moves among the great figures of the most famous moment in the tribe's history, the period of Satanta and Satank and the beginnings of the reservation system. He is a traditional herbalist with a probing and inquiring mind, as open to white medicinal practice as he is to the more spiritualist methods of other Kiowa healers.<br />Each of the Tay-bodal stories hinges on a crime that has serious community implications for the tribe, and in each, Tay-bodal finds a solution through a combination of logic and action adventure. And the stories are linked together by the development of Tay-bodal's personal life.<br />In this, probably final, book in the series, Medawar does something daring and touching, casting the entire book as a reminiscence of her hero, deep in his old age. The device works, as the plot involves reconsidering a crime supposedly solved decades ago. As the book ends, the old man has lost most of what mattered to him. Losing him is our loss, as well.<br />This and the first book, *Death at Rainy Mountain*, are the best in the series.	2002-05-21

Talk about dreamland. And the book is perfect. After you read the first ten pages, you will have trouble putting it down.<br />Bentley moves swiftly from her own personal connections to her subject matter: dance, a poignant photograph of Colette, Balanchine's curious interest in Crazy Horse strippers, her own experiment in confrontational nudity. She writes a brief chapter on the historical and literary Salome that is, among other things, the most intelligent essay I've ever read on Wilde's play.<br />She devotes a chapter each to the four centers of the fixation on Salome--Maud Allen, Mata Hari, Ida Rubenstein, and Colette--while providing a wealth of information on the changes in the history of dance between 1890 and 1920. And she finds in women's fascination with Salome a psychological core that is compelling and persuasive.<br />This is an excellent book.

Patrick McCabe's *The Butcher Boy* comes close, but Freddy Clegg is the banality of evil given unwilling flesh with none of the operatic violence of McCabe's psychopath. His slow descent into murder is all the more frightening in that it is not a descent at all but a revelation, of the consistency of his alienation and sociopathy.<br /><br />I've seen complaints that Freddy's tedious blandness is boring reading. My sympathy. I don't remember too clearly my first reading (I read the book for the fifrth time recently), but I still read hoping, hopelessly, that he will crack somehow, that something will break through his crazed porcelain surface to a human heart.<br /><br />The astonishing thing about the book is that it is not, in any sense, an exercise in sadism. Miranda's suffering is never enjoyable; Freddy's cruelty is never attractive. I always felt that the movie erred in casting a vaguely attractive person like Terence Stamp for the role, and early paperback covers depict a similarly romantic figure. Freddy begins as a non-entity, as heroic as Eichmann, and he descends from that depth to a degradation, an abdication of humanity that is absolute.<br /><br />Miranda reminds me, in her vulnerability, of a statue I once saw at the Denver Art Museum. The artist (John de Andrea?) was doing three-dimensional photorealism. He had sculpted his model as a sleeping nude so lifelike that she was startling. But his wonderful gem was a lifesize sculpture, also nude, of the same model standing up, staring back at us, her body language conveying so unambiguously the helpless humiliation of being nude in a room of the clothed. She was unbearable to look at. I stayed at the exhibit for a quarter hour to watch the reactions of patrons confronted by this image, and it was uniform: embarrassment and discomfort.<br /><br />It is brilliant book, *The Collector*, an absolutely flawless portrait of alienation and sociopathy, an exercise in tragedy.

It is one of the most intelligent, most stimulating books I have ever read. Like a country you revisit, each tour is different, deeper layered, flawed by age and familiarity, perhaps, but always, at the same time, new.<br />My own maturity has affected the way I have read this palimpsest and mirror; I remember being shocked, on second reading, to recognize what a callow, shallow creature Nicholas was. Now, myself Conchis' age if not his equal in wisdom, I can scarcely bear this vain British poetaster with his self-absorbed despair and self-serving rationalizations.<br />On my first reading, I was sure the monsters were on the balcony, staring at Nicholas and Alison. On my second, I was sure they weren't, and weren't monsters either. Last year, I understood that it doesn't matter; it is not knowing that matters, but doing. It is not what is done to us, but what we do, that matters.<br />I have adopted as my own motto, &quot;Cause no unnecessary pain.&quot; What better gift can another mind give us, than a single motto to live by?

His meditation on a sparrow's nest is worth the cover charge, discussion of the place of English in the mind of the Indian artist (&quot;Beauty All Around&quot;) is a model of deeply felt exposition, and the cycle of poems on whether Indians exist is both witty and tragic.<br />Taste the best, a literary flavor perhaps too exotic for the general reader, but worth the adventure.

Fowles' novels are always superficially simple and unplumbable in their philosophical depths: *The Collector*, *The Magus*, *The French Lieutenant's Woman*, *A Maggot*.<br />Sarah Woodruff is at once utterly inexplicable and absolutely believeable. And her believeability extends to the unthinkable. As well as we \\"understand\\" her, we cannot choose the \\"right\\" ending any more than Fowles can.<br />Humans are creatures of dizzying Hazard. I once heard Richard Loewentin argue that even if behavior could be \\"determined\\" by complete knowledge of motives and stimuli, as the social Darwinists believe, the sheer volume of those motives and causes would allow virtual free will. Even so, no depth of understanding can determine Sarah's behavior, no fount of self-knowledge binds her to any course.<br />Chance circumstances, trivial as the nail lost from the horse's shoe, trigger the chaotic avalanche of the action after the incredible sex scene. So it is in life; the trivial becomes the deciding element.<br />I lost a Sarah, as randomly and as much through my own error as Charles did.

She's clever, she's beautiful, she's seriously dangerous to bad guys.<br />Like that Holmes guy, she's been so popular that Perry tried unsuccessfully to get shet of her for three novels.

Meantime, there are three good novels (*Vanishing Act,* *Dance for the Dead*, *Shadow Woman*) and two better-than-average-but-kind-of-half-hearted ones (*Face-Changers,* *Blood Money*). In each of the last three books, Jane promises her husband that she will stop now. Perry's done two novels since *Blood Money*, and it looks like Jane's last retirement took. What a shame.<br />In *Dance for the Dead*, the action begins on page one, and by page five Jane has fought her way through a gauntlet and five or six key people are dead. From this dazzling start, it's a wild ride of switched identities, super-killers, and Jane's mysto/techno woodlore that brings us, breathless, to a celebration on the Seneca rez.
