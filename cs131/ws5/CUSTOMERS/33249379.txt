It focuses on bringing up certain questionable areas of democracy contained in our constitution and given possible solutions.  As a book that introduces or reintroduces certain political concepts, this book is thought-provoking throughout and well worth reading.  It better aquaints one with the American system of government through open questions and then tries to add fuel to age old question of the best type of constitution.  Plato and Aristotle introduced us to such a question and Dahl continues the never ending game of what is the best structure by which a political system should be based.  This is a great book to read.	2003-05-17

The beauty of this book is that the main points are in Ghandi's exact quotes while the flow of the arguments are edited by his biographer, Louis Fischer, to give a great feel of direction.  Because Ghandi edited his own newspaper his life-changing views are abundant and easily accessible.  If only this book were read by all leaders of people.	2003-05-17

Nonetheless, this is perhaps my favorite fiction book because the length of the book allows for a plot to unravel slowly and to be extremely intricate.  Ever read a novel and wish it were twice as long? Well, this book is three to six times the length of most modern novels.  Although one can skip 10-30 pages at times without missing a beat (due to Hugo philosophising about certain issues of importance to him or to his era and not to many now), this book is tough to put down.  I think I read it in three weeks.  I would encourage all readers to pick this up and get lost in the world created by Hugo.	2003-05-17

The thesis that most if not all leaders of people are similar to primate alpha males in the sense that they have more concubines and children, not necessarily more intelligence or ability but more macho desire to rule over others for the sake of ruling (whether known or not by the agent), and that much in the politics of primates and that of humans is remarkably similar is fun to examine and read about.  My only desire was that after ten years of studying and researching for this book, maybe the University of Kentucky emeritus psychiatry professor could have focused even more on the roots of the nature of political leaders, both in the primate and strikingly similar human realms.  I expected much from this book and did not get as much as I would have hoped, but it was still an excellent read thanks to the depth of research it contains.  All national leaders from the 20th century collated and examined as a whole in comparison with primates: maybe there is ample reason to be disappointed in a 400 page book trying to take on so much.  Nonetheless, the accounts of the idiosyncracies of certain leaders, the primate-like actions of many, the sloth and greed of others, and other remarkable accounts make this a fabulous book for almost any reader interested in the imperfections of people, especially the most visable people: leaders.	2003-05-17

Maybe its because of my young age, relatively inexperienced and happy life, or inability to consistently watch Opera or Dr. Phil on television.  The reason I rated this book well is because I think this is a wonderful book for others to read.  The writing is frank, as Dr. McGraw is on television; the advice is sound and determined to turn one's self-perception on its head so to kill the old, decaying, mired self and begin afresh.  If you feel stuck in your life, are about 30 years or older, have even a key-hole to open the door to change, I think you ought to give this book a shot.  While \\"Dr. Phil's\\" personality is not very endearing to me (although I applaud what he does for others) and I soon lost interest in reading this book, I do think it was well-written (I lost interest because I had no interest in revolutionarily changing myself because I was and am perfectly content with who I am--therefore giving me little interest in religiously following the doctor's every word).  In short, buy/borrow/check out this book if you have any reason to change.	2003-05-17

However, I think Kevin Phillips might be reading too much into these stats.  He sees a linear development taking place in which one country is allowed to be top dog in material development and strength.  Once this top dog reaches a certain limit of inequality of wealth he believes the dog falls to lap dog in international perspective and no longer leads the race of dogs.  (This dog thing is getting old--my invention, not Phillips')  I think Phillips is trying to do too much with his remarkable compilation of statistics on wealth.  First, who is to say that the statistics of inequality are the only determinant of a societies basis for economic strength.  Perhaps political culture, effectiveness and openness of government, level of democracy, culture, homogeneity of population and language, and rule of law should be given greater weight together than level of inequality deserves standing alone.  Inequality is not good and I desire for all to be rich, but it is not realistic when the opportunities are not equal and people's abilities are not equal.  I therefore feel this recent obsession with economic inequality as a great bane to be a waste of breath.  Economic inequality cannot be avoided but can be managed so to make things better for those on the lower end of this inequality.  Phillips' belief that the current tax rate and division of property currently in the hands of the top 1% and 5% will lead to the collapse of American hegemony is misguided.  America is home to the richest population ever to inhabit the earth and its tax rate is progressive.  I am not an advocate for the current welfare state and desire more change so to benefit more of America's poor, but I do find Phillips' views to be alarmist. Just for the statistics alone: buy this book.  Also, his historical arguments about Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, and Britain are also informative, if sometimes misguided.	2003-05-17

On the premis that &quot;[f]reedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed[,]&quot; this book argues the foundation of the social outlook of his movement and for a more natural worldview.  The arguments are based on what Dr. King knew: the Church Fathers (eg, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas), the US Constitution, and a realistic belief in people being equal in the sense of all being human and there being no subsets.  I wish every person in the world could read and fully understand this book.	2003-05-17

The strongest part of this book is the connection between the liberty to choose what one wants to purchase and the consequent political freedom that entails.  I also enjoyed the concept that economic power spread throughout all classes (ie, wealth) is a form of political power and therefore a protection against the power and tyranny of government.  There are some areas I did not quite understand (eg, the sections on banking), but I did largely agree with the arguments of all sections I did understand.  (I'm not an economist.) An excellent read for understanding America and any other capitalist country and the interplay between liberties and capitalism.	2003-05-17

This book is like health class on steriods: the confessionals, anatomical diagrams, sex positions, and aim to inform so to foster more healthy relationships.  Oh yeah, this book is also a strong promoter of great sex.  Don't just look at pictures, you should also read because the content is remarkable and capable of improving your relationship with your partner and increase your success in the sack.

The psychological developments of the main character are rich.  I think the question of the novel applies to any era governed by the rule of law: If one commits a crime that kills or utterly injures another thinking that the eventual benefits of the crime outweigh the consequences of the injuries of the crime, then one must still cope with knowing one has stepped outside the path of being a modern human; that is, the book's premise is that we are all connected and our conscience may or may not (I don't want to entirely give away the books plot) be able to cope with stepping on the roots of our common human experience.  Exceptional read and well-worth buying, even if to simply say you have a penchant for Russian novels.	2003-05-17

This book's stats are somewhat outdated because so much has happened in the last 15-20 years, which takes away from the crispness of the argument, but the argument is still apparent and sound.  Although I agree that eliminating government red tape to let more people become a part of the economic system and therefore become plugged into the benefits of the system (eg, a legal work address for customers to reach you at, legal recognition so to advertise, etc.) and thereby allow government to collect more taxes so to (hopefully) put more money toward fighting social problems; I hope de Soto agrees that the economic answer to terroism is not the only answer.  Stregthening the economic infrastructure is a strong part of the answer, but much more is also needed for some people to not desire to kill other people, and that may be something which can never be had.  Although I would say \\"The Mystery of Capital\\" is a must read, this is nonetheless a great supplement to \\"The Mystery of Capital\\".	2003-05-17

If you are torn apart emotionally, need something refreshing to awaken your senses to what life really offers, and/or have been unsatisfied with the effects of counseling, church, and all other conventional ways of seeking satisfaction or consistent acceptance of yourself--then I would recommend this book. (Although I have never had counseling and went into reading this book perfectly satisfied with myslef, but wanted to see if the book offered any new vision--which it does.)  I would have to say the author seems to me a bit of an eccentric/visionary (in the sense I cannot imagine him making much of a living in any other historical era because he would have probably been burned at the stake, hanged for blasphemy, if he hadn't already committed suicide).  In the sense of his struggles and sense of enlightened vision and then promotion of this enlightened self, the author, Eckhart Tolle, could be likened to a modern day Muhammad, Jesus, or Bhudda (I hope no one is offended).  The message is clear and draws from the author's believed similarities of all major religions and world philosophies.  This book would not be suitable for any unable to let go of religious biases, though; it is perfect for those objective and accepting enough to give new ideas a chance.  As the title eludes to, this book focuses on what we can do as individuals to see our true, inner-self so as to first understand what and who we are as individual spirits/people and to then arrive at spiritual oneness with ourselves.  The object is to follow the logic of the book, step by step, to ultimately arrive at spiritual enlightenment, which is the point where one will be content with their abilities and inabilities, learn to appreciate and take advantage of every moment (ideally, of course), and learn to behave as you only once wished you were capable of behaving towards others.  Like any religious belief, the ideal can never be obtained, but this book is a healthy start.  I have much respect for the author's views, and think this book should be widely read so as to open more minds to a more refreshing and non-violent spiritual paradigm.	2003-05-17

This is not the typical history book and is well-written.  There are plenty of funny, interesting, and most often brief acounts given that help one understand and provide laughs at times.  Schama is not a British historian and has lived in the US for maybe the last 25 years.  But on account of being British, a Columbia professor, and--based on reading his three volumes on British history--an excellent writer, he has been encouraged and has writen about British history.  <BR>After reading this book I got a good feel of the life at the time, and I think that is largely due to the historical records Schama uses that show the emotions and logic of the times.  The beautiful pictures also help in fostering a sense of what Britain is and was like.

Although Zinn's views can sometimes go too far, I do think that even in the event of going too far he brings in new ideas that would provoke the reader into thinking about their veracity and therefore entering into a dialogue that does not always happen when reading.  If you do not like liberal views this book is worth reading just to aquaint yourself with what the other side thinks and therefore strengthen your views from attacks; if you are liberal this book was written for you to salivate over.  The many unmentioned or little mentioned groups of US history are given space in this book: women, blacks, unions, poor, etc.  I found that I learned more about what is lamentable about America's past along with a greater appreciation for where America has come to be and where it still needs to go.  A great thought provoking book that should be read by all Americans.	2003-05-17
US	33249379	R30OX6YAEQNTIK	0786867523	145890607	A History of Britain, Vol. 2: The Wars of the British, 1603-1776	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Fun Read	If history bores you and you enjoy reading, I think Schama intends more to educate through entertainment than to simply educate.  This is not the typical history book and is well-written.  There are plenty of funny, interesting, and most often brief acounts given that help one understand and provide laughs at times.  Schama is not a British historian and has lived in the US for maybe the last 25 years.  But on account of being British, a Columbia professor, and--based on reading his three volumes on British history--an excellent writer, he has been encouraged and has writen about British history.  <BR>After reading this book I got a good feel of the life at the time, and I think that is largely due to the historical records Schama uses that show the emotions and logic of the times.  The beautiful pictures also help in fostering a sense of what Britain is and was like.  This book is a very easy and enjoyable read read, and I think this book is perfect for the reader unfamiliar with British history but does not take to history per se.	2003-05-17

I am a lay reader coming to this subject, so this was more to create ideas on my part than anything else.  Because of my lack of expertise, I would just like to say it is well worth reading.	2003-05-17

Nevertheless, I feel his life is worth reading about and there is no better strat than with Womack's account (or perhaps Samuel Brunk's).  Great book written about a Mexican legend.	2003-05-17

While it may be a &quot;Citizen's Guide to the Economy&quot;, I still think economists could come up with a more easily read book for citizens to read.  That is, I think there is still a certain level of education needed to fully understand this book.  I don't envision my parents or grandparents being able to read at this level in order to fully grasp most concepts.  Aside from that, this is a great intro book on economics.	2003-05-17

For that reason it should be a sign to casual readers that it is worth reading; and a sign to economists and others that I do not have the proper knowledge to best review this book for all it is worth.  However, I found it to be concise and easy reading.  The arguments for why the economic infrastrusture needs to be reshaped in developing countries so to open the benefits of being plugged in to the mainstream of money-making are convincing.  For books on economics, this is easy to understand and makes it feel more like reading a well written newspaper article than a book about economic infrastructure and government mishaps in developing countries.	2003-05-17

This may not be a book for casual readers unfamiliar with the history of empires.  It might be too long and not having enough direction (although I would argue--after reading this book--Russia as a country is really rather a country too big with not much direction as well).  Russia is a difficult place to write about and I think the author did a superb job.  <BR>(I might have a great advantage coming into reading this book that the other reviewers may not have had: I have taken 4 history classes in the last two years and took a year off from school to specifically studied where the world has come from to be what it is, which meant studying the ancient Mediterranean, Greece, Rome, Britain, America, Spain and other empires.  Thus, my focus was on how Russia became an empire and the struggles of maintaining its empire and its rank in the world at the same time.)<BR>I found this book excellent because it gave me a greater understanding of a place I am fascinated by.  An empire whose elite are Western-bred; whose inhabitants speak about 200 languages and are a mix of Orthodox and other Christians, Muslims, and secularists; a land covering more mass than any other modern country and which borders the EU, China, Mongolia, Central Asia, Korea, and is a stone throw away from Japan, Iran, Turkey, the USA, Canada; a country that was a recognized superpower competitive with the USA; and a country which is currently recovering and reeling at the same time because of disease, an inadequate welfare state, corruption, mobster rule, economic shock policies, and the after taste of Communism.  This country and its people are fascinating and the author does a good job of explaining how Russia came to become an empire and how Russia, once an empire, reacted to the diversity of people, and its strange place in the middle of Euraisia as a glob of mixed people and mixed histories.  Russia is still trying to attain progress and western permanence and to aquire an identity.  Because Russia is such a diverse empire so unlike the relatively homogeneous American empire, it might be difficult for Americans that are casual readers to fully understand a book of this nature.  I hope this review helps to encourage some to try and read this book because I feel it would be well worth it.	2003-05-17

This book helped me further de-mythicize my understanding of the Revolution and to make more sense out of what happened between 1789 and 1800 in France.  In such heady times where a king and queen were beheaded, the power holders were turned on their heads, French were chopping people to pieces and walking around Paris with heads impaled on spears, and the new government took to killing unnecessarily.  This book gave me evidence that civilization is only skin deep and that what exists is not necessarily what will exist in future and is what ought to be.  A great book.	2003-05-17
