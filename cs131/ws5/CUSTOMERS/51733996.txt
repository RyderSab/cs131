But this book gives practical information you can REALLY put into effect in your daily life. Even I can manage a minute a day.<br /><br />I also like the way the book is written ... half of it is an interesting fictionalized story; the other half is the \\"advice\\" book. The two halves mesh together perfectly so we can see an example of how the tips work in real life.<br /><br />I think the author is absolutely right that we need to take responsibility for our own health, and that our dependence on the medical industry is part of the global health problem we're facing. If we can find a way to get healthier without drugs and surgery, we'll be much better off. The advice in this book can help us to just that.<br /><br />Bravo to Drs. Lerner and Loman for this excellent book.	2005-10-09
US	51733996	R2VXIIWSBDK7DJ	015602943X	798265328	The Time Traveler's Wife	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Despite everything, I liked it.	NOTE: This review refers to the abridged audio version.<br /><br />I do not care for time travel books and I do not care for \\"romance\\" novels. Yet somehow this book, which contains a time traveling man and is most assuredly a story of romance and love, was intriquing enough to keep me riveted until the very end.<br /><br />The characters are nicely developed and thoroughly likeable, with minor players perfectly filling in the spaces. Niffenegger's prose is poetic without being inaccessible or stilted -- it flows with a naturalness that was enhanced by the dual narrators. It was interspersed with humor that kept it from becoming maudlin. Somehow, Niffenegger even made the time traveling believable!<br /><br />While abridged versions are usually worthless (would you read the 'Reader's Digest' condensed version of a print book?), this book might actually have benefited from being shortened. Had it been much more than 12 hours, it might have dragged and started getting repetitive.<br /><br />If you choose to read or listen to it, be patient and persevere. It took me a while to \\"get into it,\\" and figure it out, but once I did it was worth the effort. Be aware that there are graphic sex scenes, so if that's something you try to avoid, you might want to pass on this. But they're done tastefully for the most part.<br /><br />All in all, an enjoyable, better than average book that will appeal more to romantic women than to sci-fi reading men.	2005-09-25

That's part of the enjoyment of this book, which never takes itself too seriously but still packs a wallop.<br /><br />All the characters, in fact, are idealized as they would be through the eyes of someone like Taita. But I came to care about them and grieved over them when they died.<br /><br />There is a great deal of humor in the book as well, which is needed to balance out the epic drama and violence. Smith did a masterful job of story telling.<br /><br />I don't know enough of Egyptian history to know if the story is \\"accurate\\" (although who really can tell?. If you're looking for history, try the non-fiction section. But if you're looking for a \\"good read\\" with the feel of historic authenticity, then give this a try.	2005-04-02

It has tremendous promise, with two interesting (though not yet fully developed) characters and the relationship between them to form the core of the stories. But the book read like a first draft. It needed editing, polishing and paring down to bring the story to life.<br /><br />For instance, as many others have mentioned, Jecks tends to use the same phrases, words and sentence constructs repeatedly. The most noticeable (and annoying) of these was his constant use of the phrase \\"as if\\"(as in: \\"...it seemed as if the whole city was there...\\" or \\"it seemed as if the people of Paris know ...\\" I'll wager he's used that term a thousand times through the book. This is no exaggeration - he used it 11 times in the first two pages! Sometimes, he uses it twice in a single sentence.<br /><br />Jecks also doesn't seem to understand the need to establish a consistent point of view. Although he normally uses the third person point of view (Simon), he lapses occasionally into the omniscient POV, letting us in on the thoughts of various characters. This would be fine, but you can't be selective in that point of view - if we are to be privy to a character's thoughts at all, we should have access to them always. You can't, on one page, tell the reader what a certain character is thinking, then hide that characters' thoughts from the readers at a more critical point of the story.<br /><br />The book also suffers from the common \\"sit down and I'll tell you the whole thing\\" ending, where all the motivation, etc., is summarized in a long (VERY long) explanation at the end.<br /><br />Then, there is the problem of typos in the text (like \\"trail\\" for \\"trial.\\") Not a major flaw (I'd hate to be judged on MY typos!) but another indication that the book was not thoroughly edited.<br /><br />Finally (and the following may be considered a SPOILER, so be careful), I am not sure I can consider one of the main characters a \\"hero\\" after reading the ending and knowing what he did. I don't care about the motives. Knowing this person was so cold blooded as to kill the way he did will make it difficult for me to accept him as one of the main protagonists in future novels.<br /><br />I already have two more in the series in my library and I may very well read them someday. But unlike many of the other historical mysteries in my collection, I doubt if I'll be in a big rush to get to them.<br /><br />By the way, if you like historical mysteries in the Cadfael mold, give the books by Kate Sedley a try. They're a bit hard to come by, but they are excellent and have one of the most likeable protagonists I've come across yet. They are among my favorite books in the genre.er reading the ending and knowing what he did. I don't care about the motives.

I have read several of the other reviews here and noted that, for many, the book was over long and could have benefited from some more severe editing. Perhaps, then, for once an abridged version is an improvement.<br /><br />I did not read the unabridged text, but made an exception to my usual rule and listened to the abridgement (approx. 6 hours running time). I found it fascinating and beautifully written. The characters were finely drawn, despite the shortening of the content, and the book felt complete, not chopped up or episodic, as happens so often with abridged versions.<br /><br />The reader, Maryanne Plunkett, was excellent, making it sound as though the protagonist was actually telling the tale.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed some of the \\"sideline\\" elements of the book, such as the references to Unitarianism and Universalism (I am a UUer) and to Maria Mitchell, one of my historical heroes.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the book and think it might be just the ticket for those wanting to taste the flavor of the original without wading through all seven courses.	2004-09-24

The next batch of characters comes to the fore, only to be replaced in short order by others. The cycle continues, without ever really developing anyone's character.<br /><br />Even when you do learn more about them, you don't CARE about them or their problems. They are all either thoroughly unpleasant ... or they are victims.<br /><br />The fact is, according to this book, just about everyone in New York at that period was greedy, selfish, corrupt or perverse. Wives killed their husbands, husbands beat their wives. White, black and red savages. Stupid and heartless medical doctors (okay, that one I can believe). Rape. Murder. Torture. And the author seemed to relish serving up as much graphic sex and violence as she could.<br /><br />If the story had been set in contemporary times, the book would have been considered a big trashy \\"Peyton Place\\" wannabe. But because the author threw in just about everything she ever read or heard about early New York (far TOO much!), it's acclaimed as a great historical novel.<br /><br />But to me, a novel's greatness isn't measured by how many historical facts and anecdotes you can jam into 600 pages. It's measured by the empathy you have for the main characters, and the insights it offers into human nature and the human condition. By those criteria, the book fails miserably.	2004-09-14

First, there's the warm, funny and at times poignant story of people living through the despression in drought-striken Kansas. This is the good book, filled with wonderful observations of life and friendship. Then there's the \\"murder mystery\\" which is far fetched and totally unnecessary. Frankly, I couldn't have cared less \\"who done it\\" and would have been much happier having the entire book devoted to the everyday life of these intriquing characters. It didn't need a mystery to \\"liven\\" things up.<br /><br />The mystery doesn't totally ruin the book, but it does weaken what would have been an insightful character study.	2004-09-13

There was a fascinating twist in this book, namely the class of women working in the silk factories. These unmarried women broke many taboos and lived unusual lives.<br />Unfortunately, the writer never brings the women or their times to life. She narrates the story in a dry, cliche-ridden manner, with stilted, unnatural dialog. Even the &quot;dramatic&quot; climax comes and goes without much drama. It's like a show-and-tell with no &quot;show&quot; ...<br />I sincerely hope her subsequent books delve into equally interesting topics, but that her writing skills develop to a level that can do them justice.<br />In the meantime, I would recommend &quot;Wild Swans : Three Daughters of China&quot; by Jung Chang, &quot;Bittersweet&quot; by Leslie Li , or anything by Amy Tan.<br />Barbara	2004-04-13

This one is a disappointment. It is one violent scene after another, with a body count that must be measured in the thousands. The &quot;heroes&quot; -- to use the term loosely -- are all coldhearted murderers. One's culture doesn't change that fact. Are we to admire them? Like them? Understand them? I could not, and therefore was left with reading about people who merely went from one bloody scene to another.<br />The book is sadly lacking in real insights into the Japanese culture of that age -- there is far more depth to it than mere barbaric Samurai blood thirst. If the author's intention was to show us how horrid Japan was at that time, he succeeded. But if the book had been written by a Westerner, the author would have been called a racist for such a one-sided depiction of Japanese culture and life.<br />All in all, not a book I can recommend.	2004-03-15

The plot is very thin. The characters are for the most part either uninteresting or unpleasant. There is no action and little dialog.<br />Yet, somehow these elements combine to make a surprisingly good -- even great -- book.<br />Part of the credit goes to the writing and part to the innovative and imaginative concept. I can just picture the author looking at Vermeer's painting and wondering, who was she? We've all done that. Yet, Tracy Chevalier went a step further and created a possible reality that rings true while never pretending to be anything but imaginings. An incredible accomplishment. I don't think I'll ever be able to look at a Vermeer painting without thinking of this book.	2004-01-10

I've done a bit of historical reading into that era (early Shin Buddhism) and found this book was accurate and richly descriptive.<br />As for the character of Sano, I understand some of the other comments that he wasn't &quot;heroic&quot; enough for a Samurai. But that was one of the things that made him interesting to me. He is a quite &quot;average&quot; man who gets caught up in a system that can easily swallow him whole.<br />The book, although it had a few minor flaws, was intriquing enough for me to read several more of the series and it's interesting to see the way Sano's character develops. I just finished the fourth book in the series (The Concubine's Tattoo) and look forward to all the others.	2003-11-15

I very much enjoy them, although I think this is the weakest so far -- which doesn't mean it isn't good!<br />Although I'm glad that a female character (Sano's wife) has been added, I hope it doesn't turn into a \\"Nancy Drew\\" type thing. I'm sure there were exceptions to the rule, but the women of the era (as Rowland herself points out time and again)didn't have the freedom to roam around investigating murders. (I'm a big fan of women detective fiction, so it's not that I am against a female character!)<br />Also, like many other readers here, I found this book's sex scenes a bit too graphic and unnecessary (not to mention out of character for Hirata).<br />Finally, I hope Rowland eases up on the Chamberlain Yanagisawa character. The problem with a powerful nemesis is that either he IS powerful, and can destroy his adversary -- or he's NOT powerful and therefore not a threat. You can't have it both ways.<br />But enough of the carping and complaining over minor points.

But the fact that I couldn't get past page 50 or so tells it all.<br />I've liked some of Greeley's books in the past, but this one was so dull and preachy that I didn't know -- or care -- who was who or what was happening.<br />The characters were pure stereotypes and the dialogue was as unbelievable as I've ever read.

It's filled with heart, soul -- and humor (the passages with Miss Cora and Maggie are hilarious and poignant at the same time -- a rare accomplishment).<br />I've always had a weakness for Southern writers, and Trobaugh is a worthy successor to Eurdora Welty.

Starting with general information on what, where and how to collect, Rendell then examines collecting specialties from such as the American West, Presidents, WWII, Music, Science, etc. He gives specific and detailed information which will help you understand autographs and avoid buying fakes.<br />It contains hundreds of signature facsimiles, which are extremely important for comparison purposes.<br />Rendell is one of the most respected autograph dealers in the country and manages to be interesting as well as informative.<br />This is a &quot;must have&quot; book for any serious autograph collector.	2001-06-24

The are all very good, with a nice variety of styles and plotlines and some are truly excellent. My favorite is the Maltese Double Cross by Carole Nelson Douglas -- which has got to be one of the most hilarious cat stories ever written. Just picture Sam Spade with fleas and a hair ball and you'll get the right image. She has an incredible flair for dialogue and the entire book is worth it for this one story!	2001-05-21

Absolutely hilarious play, with great acting by a terrific cast. The plot is funny, and the dialogue is funnier. What made this very special for me was the format -- a &quot;live&quot; audio theater performance. It was like being on Broadway. A great experience.	2001-05-20

In addition, it was extemely slow going for the first 4-5 tapes. I almost gave up on it. It did get a little better in the second half, but I don't think Coontz has an ear for dialog, especially then he's using it to have a character expound on political themes (no one *really* talks like that!).<br />This is apparently one of a series of &quot;Jake Grafton&quot; novels but I've never read any of the others (have you noticed that heros in these books always have names like Jake and Buck ... aren't there any heroic Leonards or Marvins in the world?)<br />One great line I will always remember is: &quot;Either he was telling the truth or a liar of Clintonian proportions.&quot;<br />The reader was very good, but I did have one complaint. The chapters are apparently broken up into sections, which shift from one subplot to another. The reader never even paused between them, so it took a few sentences to realize it switched &quot;story.&quot; Yet, between chapters, he paused so long I thought the tape had come to the end. But that's a relatively minor flaw.<br />All in all, this book was good enough to keep me listening to the end, but wouldn't cause me to run out and buy any other Coonts novels.	2001-04-15

By the end of the book, I felt I knew Lizzie and her kids and the rest of the characters, and I cared about what happened to them. Granted, there were times when I wanted to tell her to leave that *(@&amp;$( husband of hers&lt;G&gt; but the story was so gently told that I could understand why she did what she did.	2001-01-14

In this day and age, getting even one novel and useful idea out of a book is the exception rather than the rule.<br />Granted, there are many parts of this book which didn't apply to me (a great deal of it centers around spouse and children). But her ideas for a &quot;Memory Jar,&quot; a &quot;Feel Good File,&quot; and a &quot;Policy statement&quot; were worth the price of the book alone.<br />Although it won't change my life (that would be asking a lot from ANY book), I found &quot;Stop Screaming at the Microwave&quot; to be better than average.	2000-12-31

I didn't grow to like ANY of the characters or care about what  happened to them.<br />I have very much enjoyed Anne Tylers' other books and  recognize that she is a major talent. Her observations are keen and her  prose is flawless, but not even she could bring this family of bickering,  simpering and aimless people to life for me.<br />I will confess that I  didn't make it to the end -- I listened to the audio version and made it to  the 6th tape before realizing that life is too short to waste on books you  don't like.	2000-08-12

I assumed it was the vanity  project of a second lady with time on her hands. What I found, instead, was  an incredible collection of excellent photographs from a talented and  experienced photojournalist. Skim past the family pictures (except for the  one of Al as Frankenstein!) and concentrate on the pictures that document  some of the most important people and places of our day. I'd recommend this  book to any photographer who wants to be inspired by fine work.	2000-05-23

It's scary stuff, but everyone should read it before they take  another pill, step into another M.D.'s office, have their kids vaccinated,  or agree to surgery or medical treatment. At least you'll know what you're  getting yourself into.	2000-05-09

The lead character -- bounty hunter Stephanie Plum -- is one of the most original and fascinating protagonists I've read so far. She's funny  and tough at the same time, and Lori Petty &quot;plays&quot; her to  perfection. I can't imagine a better reader for this book. I just wish it  had been unabridged!	2000-02-21

Newspapers and magazines aren't going to risk losing all that ad revenue by telling the truth about drugs, including vaccines. That's why  every parent should read this book. At least you'll be able to make an  informed decision about which drugs to have pumped into your children's  bodies. The material in this book is all documented and factual and it  provides a fascinating, though at times frightening, look at the vaccine  industry today.	1999-12-13

More than just a \\"whodunnit,\\" this book is part character study, part Minnesota  travelogue, and very much a good read. I thoroughly enjoyed it.	1999-04-18

The letters, interesting in their own right, serve more as the jumping off point.  Beautifully illustrated and well written, this is a fascinating book which  can be sipped a little at a time -- or consumed in a single sitting! Highly  recommended for any student of history of the fine art of letter writing.	1999-02-23
