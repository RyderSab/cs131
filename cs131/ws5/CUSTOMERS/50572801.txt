This in turn came from the regions in Britain they immigrated from.<br /><br />There is a most interesting chapter on the history of Germans, how certain geographical and historical features characterise them around the world.  Also how they were loyal to German culture of their locality not to the new country of Germany that had not existed.<br /><br />Another chapter on Jews and other middleman minorities explains many features they had in common.  They were resented as \\"parasites\\" although they had a vital economic role, as shown by the collapse of the economies of countries that expelled them.<br /><br />The chapter on slavery is probably the most important.  Sowell documents that slavery has been ubiquitous throughout all cultures, and usually had nothing to do with race.  Indeed, the word \\"slave\\" comes from the Caucasian race of the Slavs.  And black Africans were most often enslaved by other black Africans.  Indeed, Europeans would die of tropical diseases if they ventured into the African interior, so they had to use Africans to gather slaves.<br /><br />But it was only western Europe that ever abolished slavery.  Indeed, it was the \\"religious right\\" like Wilberforce who campaigned against slavery.  And \\"British imperialism\\" that enforced the ban by using naval might to overpower slaver ships of other nations.	2005-08-10
US	50572801	R2D52A28492CJZ	0970906307	471638895	The Mormon Defenders	Books	5	17	22	N	N	Essential reading for all who might encounter Mormons	This is the first book by J.P. Holding, president of the highly effective Tekton Apologetics Ministry, and I hope it won't be the last.  While a lot of books were enough to refute most Mormon missionaries, a new breed of Mormon apologetics has emerged.  And although this has not filtered through (even according to the laments of these Mormon apologists), it is essential that Christians are prepared for the strongest arguments they could encounter.<br /><br />The first chapter deals with one of the most blatant examples of contradiction -- the Mormon concept God being an exalted man.  Holding first shows that the Mormon case is wanting, by misunderstanding anthropomorphisms, assuming that theophanies represented God's permanent state, and the unwarranted expansion of the Incarnation that was unique to Christ.  Then he presents the biblical case against the Mormon teaching of divine embodiment.<br /><br />This and all the other chapters end with an important discussion of the Mormon charge that the historical Church has apostatised through Hellenistic philosophy.  One important point is much like those who claim our biblical texts are corrupted: OK, produce the *uncorrupted originals* or clear proof of what they said, because a charge of corruption can be sustained only if we can show what the extant texts are corrupted *from*.  Similarly, Holding shows that there is not the slightest trace of an allegelly uncorrupt Jewish or early church teaching that looks anything like Mormonism. Conversely, the Jewish historian Josephus and the anti-Jewish Roman historian Tacitus confirm that the Jewish concept of God was one of an eternal Creator of all things.  And historic Christianity's conception, in the areas of dispute between Mormonism, is firmly based on the biblical Jewish conception.  Also, in some chapters, Holding shows that if anything, any Hellenistic influence would have been in the *opposite* direction to historic Christian doctrines.<br /><br />The chapters all end with a helpful conclusion and key points, but don't skip the meat either!<br /><br />The second chapter discusses the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation compared to the Mormon teaching of polytheism.  The most important part was analysing the New Testament in the historical context of the Wisdom tradition.  Here, Wisdom was such an important and eternal aspect of God's nature that it was personified, so it was known as a hypostasis.  The New Testament identifies Jesus as this Wisdom of God, equal in *nature* with God while being subordinate in *role* only.  Both the Gospels and Epistles have extensive parallels, e.g. Col. 1:16-17 \\"by him all things were created ... He is before all things and in him all things hold together.  Compare Wisdom of Solomon 1:16,7: \\"for he created all things that they might exist. ... that which holds all things together knows what is said.\\"  An extensive endnote also notes the Targumic concept of Memra (word) as another example of Jewish teaching of plurality within the one being of God.  Hebrew Christian scholar Dr Arnold Fructenbaum argues strongly that the Johannine Prologue identified Jesus, the Logos (word), as embodying all aspects of the Memra.<br /><br />Another important application of historical context is the Semitic Totality Concept.  This is applied to the criteria for salvation and in particular the Mormon teaching of baptismal regeneration.<br /><br />Certainly salvation is by grace through faith not by works (Eph. 2:8-9), so baptismal regeneration is wrong.  But under the STC, actions and thoughts were so intimately linked that a  faith that produced no works was not a saving faith at all.  So in reality, we *will* preform works if we are saved, rather than a case of \\"we *must* perform works to be saved.\\"  IOW works are the fruit of justification, not the root.  In particular, (water) baptism is what saved people do, not what people DO to be saved.<br /><br />It is also important to understand the logic of conditional statements.  Some Mormons use passages that suggest a judgement based on works, e.g. Rom. 2:5.  But the logic is: IF you persist in obeying the Commandments, THEN you will inherit eternal life.  But logically, conditional statements do NOT assert the truth of anything, just what happens IF the condition is met.  And the whole point in context is that NO ONE, apart from Christ, has fulfilled the condition of perfect obedience.  So our salvation depends on God's grace alone through faith.<br /><br />Other chapters cover the interesting verse on baptism for the dead, once again with cutting-edge scholarship, human pre-existence, and their particular doctrine of men becoming Gods.<br /><br />My only gripe is not with the author but with the very annoying American practice of putting footnotes at the end of the book (i.e. endnotes), in chapter order.  Especially with Holding's extensive teaching in these notes, it is a pain to have to go to another place to find the note, and also make sure I know what chapter I'm on.  Footnotes at the bottom of the page are much better.  So I request that publishers produce more reader-friendly books, and resist the pathetic excuses \\"we have always done it that way\\" or \\"scholars prefer it like that\\".

Lilienthal and Bondarevsky had tied for first in the USSR championship, and were to play off, while Botvinnik was only in the top six.  But he was able to persuade the authorities that neither of the winners had a hope of challenging Alekhine for the world title, so asked for a match-tournament of the top six, which coincidentally was enough to include him!<br />However, in this tournament Botvinnik showed his amazing capacity to learn from his defeats.  Of course he is famous for putting this capacity to such good use in later return matches for the world championship.  He won this tournament by a huge margin, and won all his individual matches.<br />In my view, Botvinnik was the strongest player in the world after this tournament.  The 1946 Groningen super-tourney and especially the 1948 World Championship match-tourney merely ratified what most of the chess world already knew--he was the best.  Later on in his reign as world champ, he was, as he said, just first among equals, but before he won the title, he was a long way ahead of everyone.<br />This tournament book is also a good example of why he got so far ahead--his deep and objective analysis of his own and opponents' games.	2004-04-01

This one covers Euwe to Tal, as well as some sections on Keres, Bronstein and Geller.<br />Unlike the first book, there were some extensive personal touches to his chapters on these champs who overlapped his own lifetime.

Among the best arguments were showing that the situation ethicist can't even live consistently by his own belief system.

Almost single-handedly, she developed a Braille script for Tibetan, then went to Tibet, where she traveled on horseback, looking for blind children to teach.  Before then, blind children were hidden away or abandoned as cursed, with no future, but Sabriye was determined to give them one.  So she founded a school where she taught blind children to read, as well as other life skills such as cane travel.  She herself got around by cane by using landmarks in the city.<br />This account is just one more example of how the best humanitarian work is often founded by determined individuals with a dream.  Conversely, Sabriye was opposed at almost every turn by incompetent and apathetic bureaucrats in organizations both in her native Germany and in Tibet.<br />She clearly loves the land and people, but is not \\"blind\\" to the reality either.  The country is frightfully cold in winter as well as being prone to floods.  And she noted many of the superstitions that harm the wellbeing of the people.  But she noted the strengths as well, e.g. Tibetans designed houses to cope well with the cold, while the Chinese made concrete boxes that are hopeless.  [Reminds me of the opposite in sub-tropical to tropical Queensland.  The early settlers designed open-structured \\"Queenslanders\\" that caught the breezes very well, but later architects in New South Wales and Victoria designed houses that became convection ovens in Queensland]<br />Sabriye has a way of writing that seems very visual, so sometimes it's easy to forget she's blind.	2004-04-01

How much more so when he writes on the other world champions.<br />The book itself is well produced, and there are some interesting chessic insights into the world champs up to Alekhine.  Some of his revisitations of classic games have overturned decades-old verdicts.<br />However, it's disappointing that the biographical details were not prepared with much accuracy.  To be fair, Kasparov is only one in a long line of chess authors who were sloppy with historical data, something that people like Edward Winter are trying to remedy.<br />Even worse, Kasparov tries to psychologize the characteristics of the champs by linking them to the era they lived in.  Some are just bizarre, e.g. Alekhine's agression \\"amazingly resembles the devastating wars that shook Europe in the first half of the twentieth century.\\"  But Capablanca, only four years older, typifies \\"the years of hope and optimism.\\"  Botvinnik's \\"cold and merciless style\\" was \\"a symbol of the might of the Stalin regime!\\"  When it comes to the man who took Kasparov's title without loss of a game, he describes Kramnik as reflecting the materialist mentality of \\"What is your company worth?\\" \\"How much are your shares?\\"  Why this didn't typify the reigns of Capablanca or Alekhine, who lived through the even more extreme sharemarket exuberance of the 1920s, is anyone's guess.<br />Most disappointingly, there are even mistakes in analysis and plagiarism, although for the most part Kasparov acknowledges previous analysts.<br />I have the first two, and want to get the others when they come out.  They are an interesting and informative read despite the flaws.	2004-04-01

They also document some of the intemperance that counts for journalism these days, and the pathetic ignorance of history. Some of these arguments have been already refuted on sites like Answers in Genesis, but there is much new material.<br />It is very important to go over the history of abolition of the slave trade, and show that Christian presuppositions by Wilberforce led to its downfall, e.g. the fact that the Dominion Mandate of Genesis 1:28 did NOT extend to fellow humans. And he points out that pagan philosophers such as Aristotle regarded some people as natural slaves, and anti-Christian \\"Enlightenment\\" philosophers such as Voltaire and Hume believed in inferiority of dark-skinned people, of course exacerbated by Darwinism. Also, such statements as 'Things have come to a pretty pass when religion is allowed to invade public life' were used by the 19th Century UK Prime Minister Lord Melbourne to support the status quo of slavery. Yet we hear them often spouted by atheists today when they try to impose their own immorality on society.<br />The authors, like many historians of science, point out that the basis of modern science depends on the assumption that the universe was made by a rational Creator. An orderly universe makes perfect sense only if it were made by an orderly Creator (cf. 1 Corinthians 14:33). But if atheism or polytheism were true, then there is no way to deduce from these belief systems that the universe is (or should be) orderly. Genesis 1:28 gives us permission to investigate creation, unlike say animism or pantheism that teaches that the creation itself is divine. And since God is sovereign, He was free to create as He pleased. So where the Bible is silent, the only way to find out how His creation works is to experiment, not rely on man-made philosophies as did the ancient Greeks.<br />The book has good material on the Galileo controversy, citing the science historian John Heilbron, 'Galileo's heresy, according to the standard distinction used by the Holy Office, was \\"inquisitorial\\" rather than \\"theological\\".' They further document that this had no adverse effect on astronomy. Far from it, Heilbron's book \\"The Sun in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar Observatories\\" shows that Church-supported astronomers used the cathedrals *themselves* as solar observatories. These meridiane were 'reverse sundials', really gigantic pinhole cameras where the sun's image was projected from a hole in a window in the cathedral's lantern onto a meridian line. Analyzing the sun's motion further weakened the Ptolemaic model, yet this research was well supported.<br />The authors also cite Jeffrey Burton Russell's definitive \\"Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians\\", using this well documented information to demolish the charge that the church taught a flat earth. Rather, this was a totally baseless myth fostered by 19th century writers with a huge anti-Christian axe to grind.<br />The book also points out that the Christian world view also inspired other developments essential to the rise of modern scientific method. One was the logical thought patterns of the medieval Scholastic philosophers, and another was the little-known but extensive inventiveness and mechanical ingenuity fostered by the monasteries. This does not mean they were right about everything, but the Middle Ages are unreasonably dismissed as the \\"Dark Ages\\" despite a real industrial revolution, including inventions of water and wind power, labour-saving heavy ploughs, and ingenious architectural devices such as the flying buttress.<br />The authors also rightly point out the deceit of trying to paint the Nazis as Christian, and document the stridently anti-Nazi statements by the Confessing Church and Pope Pius XII and their work in saving lives. Here, one wishes that some quotes were better documented. Butthe authors' arguments are perfectly in line with Justice Jackson's opening address at the Nuremberg Trials, e.g. \\"The Nazi Party always was predominantly anti-Christian in its ideology\\", and \\"carried out a systematic and relentless repression of all Christian sects and churches.\\" It is also consistent with the huge amount of documentation by US Prosecutor, General William Donovan, that the Nazis also planned to systematically destroy Christianity.  This is now being published online at Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion.<br />The book also counters much Greenie lunacy by pointing out that Christianity has had a good effect on the environment, while pagan and communist countries have often had baneful effects. Indeed, the Dominion Mandate is often savaged, because it records God commanding Man to have dominion (over the Earth. However, the Hebrew word is radah, and 1 Kings 4:24-25 says that Solomon's dominion (radah) resulted in peace, safety and 'each man under his own vine and fig tree'. So the type of radah must be decided by context. Since this was spoken by God into an Edenic situation, before the Fall, it is especially hard to imagine any sort of destructive or ruthless implication to them.the authors' arguments are perfectly in line with Justice Jackson's opening address at the Nuremberg Trials, e.g. \\"The Nazi Party always was predominantly anti-Christian in its ideology\\", and \\"carried out a systematic and relentless repression of all Christian sects and churches.\\" It is also consistent with the huge amount of documentation by US Prosecutor, General William Donovan, that the Nazis also planned to systematically destroy Christianity.

He knows how to use logical arguments to show that pro-abortionists use both false premises and invalid reasoning from both false and true premises to support their view.  There is even a chapter refuting an article purporting to be 'A Pro-Choice Bible Study'.  Finally there is a fictional Socratic dialogue aimed to support non-violent civil disobedience such as Operation Rescue.<br />It has been very useful to me recently in my own writing projects on topics like embryonic stem cells.  Beckwith already anticipated such specious arguments such as,<br />*'Identical twins prove that life doesn't begin at conception' (twinning may be a form of asexual reproduction, where one embryo divides into two, but this doesn't mean that s/he wasn't an individual before then),<br />* The early embryo doesn't look human? (yes it does -- just the way it should look at that age.  Also, appearances are defective -- Statues and store mannequins look human, but are not; abnormal-looking humans like the 'elephant man' are still human).<br />* 'Most zygotes never make it to term?' (but all we humans have virtually a 100% mortality rate, but this doesn't mean it's OK to actively murder someone!)<br />* The Clintonian pseudo-Biblical argument that the account of Adam's creation shows that life begins when breathing starts (First, unborn babies do 'breathe' or at least respire, just not through their lungs.  Secondly, the creation of Adam and Eve was a special case -- 'neither of them had mothers or came from an embryo, so it's illegitimate to extrapolate from their example. It would be just as (il)logical to claim that since they began lives as adults, human life today doesn't begin till adulthood!)<br />This is easily the most comprehensive pro-life defence around, so is very important for Christians.  This is not to say that it's totally without flaws, although they are not enough to detract from a five-star rating.<br />One obvious deficiency is the lack of pictures, which are often highly effective in convincing the general public of the humanity of the unborn.<br />I also think Beckwith deals unfairly with the adoption argument on p. 15.  Of course, if the unborn baby is human and murder is wrong, this would not change even if there were no couples willing to adopt.  But the point of the adoption argument is well in line with what Beckwith practises so effectively --' both demonstrating the falsity of the premise(s) as well as showing that the conclusion would not follow even if the premise(s) were true.  So the adoption argument is really demonstrating that the pro-death premise 'there are many unwanted babies' is false, without conceding at all the inference 'if a baby is not wanted, then it can be killed'.<br />Also there is some downplaying the need for an objective moral lawgiver who has revealed His will in the Bible.  When evolution has replaced the Bible as authority, anything goes.  This is epitomised by the neo-Nazi views of Peter Singer who supports infanticide of physically 'defective' infants and elderly people with Alzheimer's -- because in an evolutionary world view, there is nothing to say that human life is any more sacred than animal life.  This is why it's not always enough to show that the baby is human.<br />But I repeat, this book is probably the single most valuable specialist defence of the pro-life view around, so is essential reading for all those who wish to stand up for unborn babies.ase -- 'neither of them had mothers or came from an embryo, so it's illegitimate to extrapolate from their example.

Even non-Americans should appreciate a book about this US Champion who was also one of the world's top 10 for almost 30 years.<br />The book covers Marshall's life set in its historical context, and also lightly annotates many Marshall games, including some draws and losses.  Marshall was famous for his combinational ability, but Soltis shows that he had confidence, with good reason, of being able to outplay many opponents in the endgame.<br />Marshall's skill should not be underestimated although he lost matches decisively to Lasker and Capablanca.  He won the enormously strong Cambridge Springs tournament of 1904 ahead of then world champ Lasker.  At St Petersburg 1914, he was one of the five finalists, and Tsar Nicholas II awarded these players the original grandmaster title.  In the mid 1920s, Marshall showed that he could cope with the new hypermoderns.  Even in the 1930s, when his strength had lessened somewhat, he captained to USA team to victory four times at the Olympiads, and the USA teams have never risen to the same heights since.	2002-05-31

The reasons for every single move are explained clearly.  The only drawback with this is that there are only so many ways to annotate 1 P-K4 (in the old descriptive notation of the book I had as a pre-teen)!<br />A number of very important principles are illustrated, and most club players need to know what rules apply in the majority of case.  The games are also good to play through.<br />The games are usually one-sided, and show what can happen when one player makes strategic mistakes.  As more advanced books such as Watson's \\"Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy\\" note, such games with unified grand plans rarely happen between evenly matched strong players, and he emphasises rule independence.<br />But Chernev's approach is appropriate for his intended audience.  I think that the reason many players BECOME strong is that they know the sort of plans he illustrates, so they know what to avoid getting caught up in!

There are many basic positions as well as examples from practical play. For endgames with more pieces, go to Fine's \\"Basic Chess Endgames\\" or for more advanced material try Shereshevsky's \\"Endgame Strategy\\".

His main thesis is rule independence. The book is really for strong club players and beyond, who have a good knowledge of the strategies in the Euwe/Kramer and Pachman books. It's important to understand the rules, which apply to about 80% of the cases (according to GM Gufeld), before learning about the exceptions.<br />Alex Yermolinsky in \\"Road to Chess Improvement\\" also acknowledges that the old instructional classics found it easier to instruct with clear strategical plans, while strong players know what to avoid and try to cross the plans, so necessitating flexibility.<br />In general, Watson makes an excellent case, e.g. with the Ivanchuk-Anand game, I think Watson's right and Anand wrong that normal pawn structure and bad bishop rules would not have helped at all, because one active rook outweighed everything else. Watson also shows some shortcomings of Nimzovich's tempo counting, and refutes Nimzo's quaint advance French lines with the move ...f6, attacking the HEAD of the pawn chain.<br />The sections on the minor pieces are superb. He astutely points out that opposition to \\"dogmatic\\" love of the bishop pair has itself become a dogma. E.g. Flesch claims that the bishop and knight have precisely equal value, but this is a dogmatic claim about two pieces with completely different moves (p. 148). It's also clear that the B-pair does constitute an advantage in very many cases, including one dismissed by Nimzo (p. 67).<br />A definite advance on the conventional strategy books is the advice on BvN in the opening. Most players learn that Bs like open games and Ns like closed ones. But in the opening, the side with a Ns often has a development advantage, so the best strategy is for THAT side to open the game, make use of the tactical abilities of the N, and force pawn moves that create permanent outposts. So the side with the Bs should seek to stabilize the position, catch up in development, then open up the game when ready, so the bishops can display their strength (pp. 178-9).<br />There is also good material on good v bad bishops. Beginners often prefer bad bishops because they can protect their pawns. More advanced players learn to reject them because of the weakness of the opposite colored squares. But as Watson shows, still more advanced players will sometimes revert to the beginner's attitude, where \\"bad bishops protect bad pawns for good reasons\\". One example I can think of is neutralising enemy rooks while one's own rooks attack undefended pawns and reduce the enemy rooks to passivity.<br />Watson does overstate his case a bit though. For example, Tal relates a post mortem after Game 9 of their first match. Tal rattled off some variations, while Botvinnik said he didn't dispute what Tal said, but just said he assessed the merits of exchanging queens. Tal first thought it was \\"too abstract\\", then came to appreciate this wisdom. Another example comes from Andy Soltis' fine book \\"Soviet Chess\\". Petrosyan thought Gufeld had violated so many rules that there just HAD to be a way to punish him, which he found. In fact, Chernev's elementary book \\"Logical Chess Move by Move\\" pointed out decades ago that a rule violation should often be punished by a rule violation.<br />I also disagree Watson's treatment of the old masters. For example, he will excuse modern greats for annotating in ways that LOOK like they are applying rules, because otherwise too many trees would have to be killed to explain the caveats. But then the same allowance should be made for the older annotators too, which Watson fails to do, unlike Yermolinsky.<br />I also wonder whether Watson actually read Tarrasch's \\"Dreihundert Schachpartien\\", which to be fair may have been translated into English (\\"300 Chess Games\\") after Watson wrote. For example, Watson claims (p. 41) about the Nimzo-Salwe 1911 game with 7. dxc5, \\"After this game,6...cxd4 was considered better [than Bxd7]\\". But almost 20 years before, Tarrasch in 300 Chess Games had played 6...cxd4 and given it an exclamation mark because, as Tarrasch *explicitly* stated, Bd7 would allow 7.dxc5 with a good game. Watson makes other less blatant errors, e.g. the usual \\"dogmatism\\" accusation (p. 95), and indeed there are a number of genuine examples. But there are many times when Tarrasch appeals to the specifics of the position, e.g. where he explains that the N goes to the edge because in that position it was important to drive the B off that diagonal.<br />Another reviewer noted the disrespect for Capablanca. For instance, on p. 94, Watson notes an example of Capa's alleged dogmatism, while Euwe and Kramer had noted Capa's NON-dogmatism. It's important to note that Capa never lived to see \\"Last Lectures\\" in print, and what he probably intended was Bogolyubov's line with O-O AND exd4. The book also has him recommending a line that falls into a trap, although his \\"My Chess Career\\" has the correct line. But I can see why Watson went just by what was written, and he does come down on Capa's side in his annotations of the famous loss to Lasker at St. Petersburg 1914.<br />I mention these shortcomings, as I see them, because most reviewers on various websites have expended many keystrokes on praise. And I repeat, the praise is NOT overstated in the case of this high-quality book6...cxd4 was considered better [than Bxd7]\\".

I think it's important to understand the rules, which apply to about 80% of the cases (according to GM Gufeld), before learning about the exceptions.  Yermo's book goes beyond those, in noting various exceptions to the strategical &quot;rules&quot;, instead teaching the way children learn languages, by just seeing how people play (speak).  He also has a lot of practical advice that he weaves into commentaries on his own games.<br />There are comparatively few topics covered in depth, outlining various plans, e.g. the Grnfeld pawn center, a good line for White in the enchange QGD.  He also discusses the role of a lead in development as crucial to the success of the Benko.<br />Showing that the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; attack against the Sicilian is not to be feared will benefit many players.<br />On the last, Yermo strongly recommends against mickey mouse openings, or trying to take a much stronger opponents &quot;out of book&quot;.  Rather, he points out that the point of an opening is to gain a good middlegame, and if playing a &quot;proper&quot; opening is &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot;.  He says he has no problem against offbeat openings that give him a good position with plenty of pieces on: &quot;I'll find a way to outplay anyone 300 rating points below me.&quot;<br />I agree though with critical comments about what Yermo says about Botvinnik and Tal.  But he is more charitable than John Watson about the classical authors.  He points out that they knew perfectly well that what they wrote was only a guide.  And like himself, found games with a clear strategic theme the most instructive for their readers, while acknowledging that this is rare between evenly matched players.	2002-05-07

OK, from each of the categories above:<br />Theology:<br />Creationists have often pointed out that there were many words or phrases that God could have used to describe a billions-of-years-old creation -- IF that's what He had intended to communicate.  One of them is olam.  But Ross claims that olam means forever, and only yom (&quot;day&quot;) could mean long period of time.  Van Bebber and Taylor pointed out that Ross's *own source* (Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament) contradicts him, stating that the Hebrew olam and its Greek equivalent aion (from which we derive the word `eon') *often* means `long age'.<br />There were plenty of other words that God could have used if He had wanted to teach long periods of time. God could also have used phrases like `x myriad myriad years ago' to teach ages of hundreds of millions of years. For a less precise indication of vast ages, God could have compared the years to the number of sand grains or stars. Yet God did not use any of these - rather, He emphasized literal days by the association of evening and morning as well as a number.<br />Exegetical history:<br />Ross has an impressive-looking list of authorities that he claimed supported his day-age approach, but on checking, it's easy to see that NONE of them did.  E.g. Basil the Great EXPLICITLY stated in Hexaëmeron 2:8 about the first day of creation: &quot;24 hours measure the space of the day&quot;.  Irenaeus, Lactantius and Augustine EXPLICITLY stated that the world wasn't even 6000 years old, which would logically entail that they CANNOT have regarded the creation days as long periods.  For example Augustine in City of God 12:10:<br />&quot;Let us, then, omit the conjectures of men who know not what they say, when they speak of the nature and origin of the human race. ... They are deceived, too, by those highly mendacious documents which profess to give the history of many thousand years, though, reckoning by the sacred writings, we find that not 6000 years have yet passed.&quot;<br />Science:<br />Ross claims that a main motivation of those opposing billions of years is fear that it would make evolution possible.  As usual, Ross's claim betrays a willing ignorance of creationist literature as well as ignorance of evolution/variation as shown above. Many years before Ross wrote any of his books, leading creationists like Dr Duane Gish made it very clear that they believed the earth was only thousands of years old, on both biblical and scientific grounds. But Gish also strongly pointed out that evolution would be impossible even if billions of years were granted, e.g.:<br />`Therefore, whether the earth is ten thousand, ten million, or ten billion years old, the fossil record does not support the general theory of evolution.' [Evolution: The Fossils Say No! Creation-Life Publishers, San Diego, CA, 2nd ed., p. 43, 1973.]<br />`Considering an enzyme, then, of 100 amino acids, there would be no possibility whatever that a single molecule could have arisen by pure chance on earth in five billion years.'

(Tom) Wright pointed out, that most of the things Jesus said, he most likely said many times, and with many minor variations.<br />I didn't give this book five stars, because Archer is unnecessarily intimidated by old-Earth propaganda, but does believe in a global Flood that actually wipes out alleged geological evidence for age.

The brief but plentiful extracts from Bob Dylan display a consistent Christian faith, and it would be impossible to do him justice without understanding what drives him at the deepest level.<br />The more detailed writings of his fellow Hebrew Christian, Arnold Fruchtenbaum, serve as excellent commentaries, although they were written independently.  The author has done a remarkable job in combining them in this way.  Of course the systematic theologian has more words in the book, but it's unfair to deny that the book is about Dylan as well, since it's his insights that head each of the many topics studied.<br />It's sad that some people resent the fact that some stars have great faith.

George Hughes was a philosophy professor (the highest academic rank in British Commonwealth countries) at Victoria University of Wellington (New Zealand) and a world-class logician. He translated Buridan's Latin and provided a clear commentary.<br />In this work, Buridan attempts to solve a number of semantic paradoxes, e.g. a one-person liar &quot;What I am saying is false&quot;; a two-person liar where Socrates says &quot;What Plato is saying is true&quot; and Plato says &quot;What Socrates is saying is false&quot;; and other even more elaborate ones. All these have in common is a proposition referring to itself, or a set of propositions where there is some circle of internal reference, hence the title.<br />Before Buridan attempts to solve the paradoxes, he discusses propositions that can not be true if they exist, but can the state of affairs described is logically possible. Such propositions he describes as &quot;not possibly true&quot; as opposed to &quot;logically impossible&quot; such as &quot;This circle is square&quot;. Buridan gave the example of a not possibly true proposition &quot;No proposition is negative&quot;. While the facts can be as the statement asserts, if the statement exists it cannot be true because it is a negative proposition itself.<br />Then Buridan discusses the validity of the inferences: &quot;All propositions are affirmative, therefore no proposition is negative&quot; and &quot;No proposition is negative, therefore some proposition is negative&quot;.<br />The point is, the usual definition of validity is &quot;it's impossible for the premise(s) to be true and the conclusion false&quot;. Thus the first would be invalid (because the conclusion is false when it exists even though it seems to follow from the premise) and the second valid (if the premise exists it is a negative proposition, so the conclusion is true). But with such self-referential statements, this definition of validity is inadequate, because in both those cases the they are contrary to other arguments with these forms (All As are B therefore no A is non-B, No Xs are Y therefore some X is Y).<br />Buridan defined a valid argument as &quot;it's impossible for the fact to be as the premise says and not as the conclusion says&quot;.<br />This becomes important when he presents his ingenious solution to the paradoxes.<br />This is not of mere academic interest.

There is also a lack of Southern hemisphere greats, e.g. IM Ortvin Sarapu, 20 times New Zealand Champion, and GM Daryl Johanson of Australia (a strong IM when this book was published).<br />Another problem is the age of the book, if one is looking for info on the current chess scene (of course this is not the author's fault).  There is nothing on the great Shirov or current World Champion Kramnik , and only three lines on the great Anand.  An update would also need a section on the Internet.<br />These quibbles aside, the articles on historical top players are  very good, there are good B&amp;W photos, and an amusing extract from the great annotator Marco.<br />One thing that makes this encyclopedia stand out is the list of lieftime scores between various players.  Divinsky also provides his Keene's assessment of &quot;all-time greatness&quot;, which may be questionable but he provides the results so people can judge for themselves.	2001-07-23

There are also good B&amp;W photos, e.g. the Habakkuk Commentary, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, so one of the earliest extant manuscripts of the OT; and P52, the oldest NT fragment.<br />There are good refutations of a number of false views, e.g. that an inspired Bible can contain error.  The authors demonstrate that Biblical errantists confuse several concepts:<br />Adaptation to human finitude vs accommodation to human error: the former does not entail the latter. A mother might tell her four-year-old `you grew inside my tummy' - this is not false, but language simplified to the child's level. Conversely, `the stork brought you' is an outright error. Similarly, God, the author of truth, used some simplified descriptions (e.g. using the earth as a reference frame, as modern scientists do today) and anthropomorphisms, but never error.<br />Limitation vs misunderstanding: while the Second Person of the Trinity was incarnate in Jesus of Nazareth, He voluntarily limited His omniscience (Phil. 2:5-11). I.e., in His humanity, He did not know all things. But this does *not* entail that He was mistaken about anything He said. All human understanding is finite, but this doesn't entail that every human understanding is errant. Also, what Jesus *did* preach, He proclaimed with absolute authority (Mt. 24:35, 28:18), because He was speaking with the full authority of God the Father (John 5:30, 8:28), who is always omniscient. So if errantists wish to maintain his charge that Christ was mistaken because of His humanity, they must logically charge God the Father with error as well.<br />Geisler and Nix also show that canonicity was *not* determined by men (e.g. the Church), but determined by God and *recognized* by men.<br />The sections on the accuracy of transmission and translation should help Christians have confidence that when they read a Bible accurately translated into their own language today, they *are* reading the very Word of God.ir own language today, they *are* reading the very Word of God.	2001-07-23

This includes showing that Christian ethics is deontological (duty-centred) rather than teleological (end-centred), e.g. utilitarianism.  In particular, it is based on God's revelation.  He rightly points out that even unbelievers have a law written on their hearts (Rom. 2:14-15), so they have no excuse for neglecting this general revelation.  But one weakness is that Geisler insufficiently stresses that Scripture must be the guide for interpreting general revelation and for determining whether one's conscience is right.<br />2) Present a good defence that the Christian position is &quot;graded absolutism&quot;, where moral absolutes exist, but a higher absolute exempts one from following a lower absolute.  His gives the ethical dilemma of not telling the truth to save lives, describes how six different views deal with this, presents both pluses and minuses, then analyses them in detail in terms of Scripture to draw his conclusion.<br />3) Analyses hot topics such as abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, homosexuality and &quot;biomedical issues&quot;.  He presents both sides' arguments, usually from science and Scripture, then effectively critiques the view he disagrees with.  The arguments seem so effective that there's little I would change even though the book is now 12 years old.  So the book is an excellent handbook for all Christians who want to argue effectively about moral issues.	2001-07-23

All Christians must know how the Bible teaches the Deity of Christ and the Trinity.<br />All the same, the Jehovah's Witnesses are perhaps the most visible cultists around, and this book also provides good documentation of their errors.  Of course, there's nothing new under the sun, and the JW denial of the deity of Christ is just a rehash of the discredited 4th century teachings of Arius.  He reminds readers that the JWs are themselves victims of the Enemy's deception, so should be treated compassionately but firmly.  His questions are very instructive and really do work!<br />As a compendium of answers to JWs, it was perfectly reasonable to answer some of the less &quot;core&quot; doctrines such as soul sleep and blood transfusions.  Sure, denial of eternal conscious punishment doesn't by itself endanger salvation, unlike denial of Christ as fully God and fully human.  But it is nevertheless a heterodoxy that can have baneful consequences for other doctrines such as the seriousness of sin and the need for the Substitute to be fully God to bear infinite wrath on our behalf.<br />In line with the fact that the JW at the door is deceived, it's good to show that the Watchtower organisation has made many errors.

He has developed a new cosmology which uses the same theoretical foundation as all modern cosmologies including the 'big-bang': Einstein's theory of general relativity.  Dr Humphreys changes one assumption in the 'big bang' cosmology, and that is that matter in the universe is unbounded, that is, all space is completely filled with matter.  This is *not* how non-experts normally imagine the cosmos.  The 'big bang' is based on another assumption called the *cosmological principle*, which states that an observer's view of the universe depends neither on the direction in which he looks nor on his location.  He replaces those assumptions with another -- a universe whose matter is bounded, that is, matter surrounded by empty space for some distance beyond the matter.  That is how non-experts normally imagine the cosmos, but *not* how expert 'big bang' cosmologists picture it.<br />The importance of General relativity is that it teaches us that time is not the same everywhere in this universe, but instead can run at very different rates. Indeed, Einstein's theory of general relativity indicates that the rate at which time passes depends on the strength of the surrounding gravitational field. With certain initial conditions at the Creation, a literal day or two could have passed on the Earth while from 'the light's point of view', it had millions or even billions of years to get here. So the entire universe was created in six ordinary Earth-rotation days, 6,000 years ago by earth clocks. Such things are possible as a consequence of general relativity, which simply is a description of the universe as valid as we are able to currently determine.<br />So far, his cosmological model has withstood all sceptical attacks to date -- he has firmly refuted Rossite attacks in the CEN Technical Journal, and the attacks and his answers are posted on the Answers in Genesis site.  Many of these bibliosceptics don't even realise the unproven *philosophical assumption* behind the 'big bang', and fail to realise that it's equally physically valid to use Dr Humphreys' alternative assumption.<br />Dr Humphreys' book is written at a layman's level, but has a technical appendix.  Dr Humphreys is humble enough not to believe that his model is necessarily the final word, but that Christians should base their faith on the Bible, which is the final Word of One who was there and knows everything.acks to date -- he has firmly refuted Rossite attacks in the CEN Technical Journal, and the attacks and his answers are posted on the Answers in Genesis site.

Its membership application (1994) says 'I subscribe to the objects and rules of the Humanist Society of Victoria in order to create a society in which a person may reach their full potential free from supernatural beliefs'.<br /><br />It's difficult to believe that anyone could honestly claim that his book was respectful to religion and not anti-Christian when it's full of puerile mocking of the Scripture, which Jesus said \\"cannot be broken\\" (John 10:35). He also claims on p. 278 that belief in life after death is evidence that one has not been 'taught how to think'. It seems the main reason for this tirade against creationism is that it challenges his religious faith.<br /><br />He uses about every unfair rhetorical trick in the book, including leading questions and guilt by association. Despite being subtitled 'reason vs. creationism', Plimer seems incapable of stringing two logical thoughts together. Plimer even brags about deceiving creationists in several places. So if he thinks that dishonesty is justified when attacking creationism, then how can a reader be sure that he's not deceiving them elsewhere for the good of the 'cause'?<br /><br />In fact, Plimer's book has the dubious distinction of being the most embarrassing anti-creationist book for many anti-creationists. His fellow anti-creationist Jeffrey Shallit described this as 'a shoddily-written polemic that, in places, verges on the hysterical' and documents examples of poor grammar, straw-man arguments, and the worst academic sin, plagiarism. Another sceptic, Jim Lippard, has described some passages in the book as being 'nothing less than a dishonest hatchet job', and uses Plimer as an example of 'How not to argue with creationists'. An anti-creationist scientist, Ian Hore-Lacy, says that Plimer 'displays a surprising ignorance of nuclear physics'.<br /><br />Plimer made many serious allegations against the Creation Science Foundation, now Answers in Genesis. Note that the charges were investigated by a committee chaired by well-known anti-corruption campaigner and former Chief Magistrate of New South Wales, Clarrie Briese, who was then a part-time commissioner with the NSW Crime Commission. And the rest of the committee all had impeccable public reputations, independent of CSF/AiG. The investigation concluded: \\"The grave allegations and/or innuendo against the ethics of CSF and its directors are not supported by the evidence.... CSF and its directors have been often and seriously misrepresented [in Telling Lies ...].\\"<br /><br />For all Plimer's self-professed scientific expertise, there are many crass blunders in science, quite aside from the creation/evolution issue. For example:<br /><br />(From a blatant plagiarism of an obviously tongue-in-cheek article about heaven and hell in the Bible) 'Brimstone (sulphur) is solid below 444 degrees C' (p. 21). But this is the boiling point of sulphur. Somehow, Plimer has confused melting point and boiling point. Sulphur actually melts at 119 degrees C. Perhaps he also thinks that water is solid below 100 degrees C?<br /><br />On pp. 29-30, he gets the important chemical concept of racemization completely back-to-front.<br /><br />On p. 125, Plimer claims: 'Kuru is *only* transmitted by cannibalism, by eating the brains of another human afflicted with the disease'. But New Scientist 142(1927):36, May 28, 1994 pointed out: 'Kuru was transmitted through handling and *possibly* eating tissue from infected corpses during funeral rites in Papua New Guinea' (emphasis added).<br /><br />For a possible reason he was accused of 'surprising ignorance of nuclear physics', see this passage from p. 25: 'This process of radioactive decay involves the release of energy and atomic particles (alpha particles) ... This method of radoactive [sic] dating uses well-known physics. This physics is tried and proven. It is the same physics which enables us to make nuclear reactors and nuclear bombs. If such a process did not work or was wrong, then nuclear reactors would not work (as they utilise the known rate of energy released from uranium 238) and our solar system's giant nuclear reactor (the sun) would not warm the earth.'.<br /><br />Of course, most high-school physics students know that the power source of nuclear reactors is actually *fission* (*not* alpha decay) of uranium *235* or plutonium 239, *not* uranium 238. They also know that the sun's main source is *fusion* of *hydrogen* atoms.  Of course, his claims about dating, involving atoms falling apart are irrelevant to fusion, where atoms come together.<br /><br />On p. 19, Plimer complains that the Bible is wrong to talk about the sun rising and setting. Maybe he should abuse modern astronomers and meteorologists who are also happy to say 'look at that beautiful sunset'. If Plimer knew elementary physics, he would know that motion must be described with respect to a reference frame, and all are equally valid for descriptive purposes, as astronomers such as the late Fred Hoyle have affirmed.<br /><br />Plimer's analysis of the Bible shows a complete ignorance of the original language or historical context. For example, on p. 17, Plimer claims the Bible is wrong to state that bats are birds, camels do not have cloven hooves, turtles have voices, etc. However, the Hebrew word translated 'bird' is `owph, and simply means 'winged/flying creature', which bats certainly are! The word is derived from `uwph meaning 'to fly'. The Hebrews simply classified animals according to function, which is perfectly reasonable. The Bible is right about camels too -- they have an elastic pad at the bottom of their hoof, which helps prevent it from sinking into the sand. This pad means the hoof is not fully divided. And if Plimer had consulted a modern translation rather than KJV where English words had different meanings from they do today, he would have found out that the verse is referring to turtle*doves*, which certainly do have voices!<br /><br />Even sillier is his claim: '... the 23 letters of the alphabet ... ' (p. 224), although we haven't ascertained which three he doesn't accept.  And he or his hero-worshippers can't claim that it is referring to an ostensibly 23-letter phrase from Dawkins, \\"Methinks it is like a weasel\\", because since the phrase involves the right sequence of 28 units with 27 possible types of character *including the space*.  Dawkins' starting sequence always had 28 characters in various combinations of letters and spaces, such as \\"WDLMNLT DTJBKWIRZREZLMQCO P \\" typed by his baby daughter.<br /><br />Silliest of all is Plimer's statement: 'In my view, the Bible is not true. However, it is the Truth.' (p. 289) Plimer could certainly do with an elementary course on logic. Bear in mind that this is a strange sort of statement from a humanist, unless he was trying to curry favour with compromising churchians who might be put off if he was more up-front about his anti-Christianity.<br /><br />Finally, *every single allegation* has been answered point-by-point by Creation Ministries International on its web site. Because of all this, it's just a shame that 'anti-stars' (negative numbers) aren't available for reviewer rankings.was wrong, then nuclear reactors would not work (as they utilise the known rate of energy released from uranium 238) and our solar system's giant nuclear reactor (the sun) would not warm the earth.'.

This book presents a number of important strategical ideas that all chessplayers should know, e.g. blockade, weak colour complexes.  Nimzo had a number of catchy terms which help people remember them, e.g. a passed pawn's lust to expand, absolute 7th rank.  The book also contains instructive annotated games.<br />But there are a few problems, some of which are pointed out in John Watson's fine book &quot;Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy: Advances since Nimzowitsch&quot;:<br />Nimzo's tempo counting lessons are the height of naivety -- Watson showed simple ways for black to get a good game despite being many tempi down.<br />Nimzo's idiosyncratic lines of the advance French give Black an easy game as Watson shows, by a well-timed ...f6.  As Watson also points out, this attack at the head of the pawn chain is effective quite often, despite Nimzo's counsel to attack pawn chains at the base.  To be fair, this is often the right strategy.<br />Overprotection has never gained the support of most grandmasters.<br />Nimzo's famous dxc5 in the advanced French against Salwe is alleged to be revolutionary and contrary to the alleged dogmatism of the Tarrasch school, and even Watson concurs.  But they both overlook that Tarrasch himself had pointed out that this gives white a good game, which is why he played ...cxd4 against Paulsen many years before.  Nimzo even presents this game in a fairly favorable light.<br />Overall though, this is a very handy book for club players up to say 1800-2000, although it's debatable whether this is better than the Euwe/Kramer two volume set or Pachman's trilogy.	2001-05-25

Some of the highlights:<br />Showing how coal could have been formed by burial of antediluvian peat bogs or floating vegetation, which makes more sense than gradualist processes.  In particular, only rapid burial explains pollen layers or Z-shaped seams.<br />Analysing the Karoo formation and showing that the proposed population densities are perfectly feasible and no more crowded than many reptile populations today.<br />Showing that the much touted geologic column exists in a complete form (only in the sense of all 10 designated periods) on only about 1% of the earth's surface.  And not even in these rare places is the thickness anywhere approaching the 130 miles thickness required for a genuinely complete column.  Nowhere on earth is the Phanerozoic sedimentary column thicker than about 7 miles.<br />Explaining much biogeographical distribution by migrations from Ararat.  This was an ideal location for the Ark's landing, since it's near the junction of three continents.  Also, mountainous regions are ideal to split off various sub-populations into the varieties we have today -- note, this is NOT evolution (which requires NEW genetic information) but merely variation (involving the separation if EXISTING information).  Woodmorappe explains the unique fauna of Madagascar and Australia very plausibly as the result of selectivity by humans who immigrated with their favorite or most useful animals.  For example, marsupials require less food and have a lower rate of post-natal growth, so would make them desirable animals for a long sea voyage to Australia.<br />Various apostates, atheists, evolutionists, sceptics (virtually the same things) have either ignored this book and keep parroting the same discredited atheistic arguments, or resort to long winded bluff and bluster.	2001-05-21

He covers chess in the Soviet Union from the October Revolution to the Union's demise.<br />Soltis covers the inauspicious beginnings of Soviet chess, largely due to the whims of Krylenko, the much feared Soviet prosecutor.  There were bad setbacks at first, particularly the defections of Alekhine and Bogolyubov, the outclassing of the leading Russians (albeit of a pre-revolonary generation) by the best Westerners at the great Moscow 1925 tournament (of course, apart from the soon-to-defect Bogolyubov), to the rise of Botvinnik to world class.<br />By the end of WW2, Soviet strength had grown enormously, but was almost unknown in the West.  The West realized it soon enough with the Soviets' drubbing of the USA team, victors in the four previous Olympiad.  Then Botvinnik convincingly captured the World Title, and the Soviets held it ever since apart from the three-year reign of Fischer.<br />Soltis also covers the horrors of Communist Russia, showing that even chessmasters were not immune from Stalin's paranoia.  Even Krylenko met the fate he had handed out to so many others.  The &quot;Great Patriotic War&quot; also took a terrible toll, including Iljin Genevsky, and Romanovsky's first wife and all their daughters.  Soltis speculates on the effects of the Soviet oppression on the character of many of its grandmasters.<br />There is a good collection of lightly annotated games, many unknown but still high quality.  At the end, there's even a guide to pronouncing Russian names, which may surprise many, but on the ones I've heard pronounced by native Russian speakers, Soltis provides an accurate guide as far as is possible with the Latin alphabet.	2001-05-21

Shattering the Modern Theory of Evolution	Books	5	81	117	N	N	Powerful demolition of neo-Darwinian dogma	Spetner does a great job of refuting the atheistic faith that random mutations plus natural selection can generate all the complexity in the biosphere.  It must be stressed that real &#8216;goo-to-you-via-the-zoo&#8217; evolution is particles to people, i.e. a means of *increasing genetic information*.  It is not enough simply to point out examples of change, because no creationist denies that organisms change within a kind (the Bible makes this clear); it must be *information-increasing change*.  Alas, many evolutionary propagandists resort to deceitful equivocation when using the word &#8216;evolution&#8217; to describe *any* change and use this to prove that molecules could have turned into mice or men and to disprove creation.<br />Creationists have long argued that many examples of &#8216;evolution&#8217;, how e.g. loss of wings can be a survival benefit to beetles on a windswept island and how fish with shrivelled eyes can do better in dark caves.  But these are *losses* of information; the exact opposite of what goo-to-you evolution requires.  They do not explain the origin of that complex information to construct functional wings or eyes in the first place.<br />Spetner makes the same point on the scale of the information coded in DNA, and the information content of the enzymes they code for.  He shows that even the beneficial mutations are caused by information loss, so are irrelevant for the goo-to-you theory.  For example, some DDT resistance in insects is caused by a mutation causing loss of binding ability.  It&#8217;s amazing to see that some atheists are unable (or unwilling) to grasp the points: increasing survival advantage, YES; increasing information, NO.  Alternatively, natural selection, YES; evolution, NO.<br />Another important example he covers is the alleged evolution of a new enzyme ability.  In this book and subsequent articles, he has shown that even these cases are really losses of information.  That is, a mutation ruined the precise fit of the active site to the protein, so it no longer does its former job so well, but does allow other substances to be affected too.  But this is leading *away* from the specific, high-information enzymes required for life, and the conclusion of this process would be a general catalytic compound that catalyzes many things, none of them particularly well.  This is hardly anything to write home about &#8211; ordinary acids and bases can both catalyse many hydrolysis reactions.<br />Note that Spetner does not say that a mutation could *never* add information, just that it is so unlikely that it could never account for the amount of information we see in living things.  Furthermore, if mutations do account for the huge amounts of genetic information we see today, then there should be plenty of information-adding mutations to be seen, but there are not.  Spetner challenges evolutionists to provide a single such example.<br />Spetner also argues against the Darwinian contention that emphasises that any mutation, however slight, will have a survival value.  Even the most complex organisms can supposedly be built up over eons from an accumulation of small mutations with slight survival values.  Spetner shows that the smaller the change, the smaller the selective advantage.  This is expressed by the selection coefficient s.  If a mutation has s = 0.001 or 0.1%, a supposedly typical value, then the number of surviving offspring is 0.1% greater for organisms with the mutant than without it.  But the smaller the selective advantage, the more likely that random effects (e.g. genetic drift) will eliminate it &#8212; its probability of survival is about 2s (actually 2s/(1-e-2sN), where s = selection coefficient and N is the population size). So the above mutation has only one chance in 500 of surviving, even though it is beneficial..of the active site to the protein, so it no longer does its former job so well, but does allow other substances to be affected too.  But this is leading *away* from the specific, high-information enzymes required for life, and the conclusion of this process would be a general catalytic compound that catalyzes many things, none of them particularly well.  This is hardly anything to write home about &#8211; ordinary acids and bases can both catalyse many hydrolysis reactions.<br />Note that Spetner does not say that a mutation could *never* add information, just that it is so unlikely that it could never account for the amount of information we see in living things.  Furthermore, if mutations do account for the huge amounts of genetic information we see today, then there should be plenty of information-adding mutations to be seen, but there are not.  Spetner challenges evolutionists to provide a single such example.<br />Spetner also argues against the Darwinian contention that emphasises that any mutation, however slight, will have a survival value.  Even the most complex organisms can supposedly be built up over eons from an accumulation of small mutations with slight survival values.  Spetner shows that the smaller the change, the smaller the selective advantage.  This is expressed by the selection coefficient s.

Good thing that Mrs Alexander is prepared to answer them in an informative way.<br />She explains how she lost her sight completely in her mid twenties because of a mysterious disease causing blood vessels in her retinas to bleed.  Sally doesn't gloss over the grieving she went through and the difficulties she faced, and the need for constant concentration even now.  But the book has an optimistic tone, explaining how she met her husband on a blind date (she notes with irony), and how her life as a wife, mother, writer and even gardener is very fulfilling.<br />There are interesting insights how blind people function in a sighted world, e.g. accessing information through Braille, talking books or the Optacon (optical-tactile converter), travelling with a cane or guide dogs, cooking, choosing clothes, and much else.  She even discusses her visit to a school for deaf kids and whether it's better to be blind or deaf, and the effect of blindness on her religious faith (increasing it) and that of her loved ones (the opposite effect).	2001-05-21

The amount of research behind it is staggering, and it provides an answer to all sceptical attacks on the Ark.<br />When I say &quot;unanswerable&quot;, I mean, unable to be answered with any real coherent arguments.  Of course, atheists and compromising churchians can always make ridiculous attacks that merely show that they are unable (or unwilling) to grasp the book's teachings.<br />The first thing to check should be obvious: the title.  The book is designed to show that the Ark was *feasible*; it *never* claims to be a proof of the Ark.  Rather it is a devastating *disproof* of sceptical attacks.<br />Second, some have claimed that the arguments are ad hoc, implausible, and the like.  But Woodmorappe's solutions are based on *real-life* farming technology that does not require complex electronics but would be accessible to any intelligent people, and would immensely cut down on labour.  E.g. there is nothing implausible about using troughs and pipes to feed and water large numbers of animals with little effort from a central station.  Nor is it the slightest bit implausible to have slatted or sloped floors so that manure falls away from the animals (or even absorb it in very deep bedding).  Disposing of manure by vermicomposting (composting by worms) is also very plausible and required very little human intervention, and the earthworms would also provides food for some animals.  Despite Woodmorappe's clear statements, it's amazing to see that some sceptics have accused him of relying on training animals to excrete into a bucket on command.<br />Third, Woodmorappe and other young-earth creationists are accused of belief in macro-evolution or hyper-evolution because they believe that many varieties could arise from the 'kinds' on the Ark.  But creationists have always pointed out that such variation arises from the already-existing genetic information by sorting into small, isolated populations.  Microbes-to-man evolution is different -- it requires NEW information to arise without any intelligent input.  There is a vast difference between mere change and change that **increases the information content of the biosphere**.  Intelligent evolutionists recognise the difference: Woodmorappe cites the evolutionist T.H. Bullock's articles from 1991 and 1993 which clearly differentiate between &quot;lateral radiations&quot; and &quot;vertical grades of complexity&quot;.<br />Fourth, what it really comes down to is a dogmatic rejection of the supernatural by the evolutionists.  It's important to note that this is NOT a scientific believe but a *philosophical presupposition*.  Christians if they are true to their name will believe Christ who affirmed the reality of Noah's Flood and Ark in Luke 17:26-27.  But because this teaches the reality of God's judgement on sin in both the past and future, the Ark is dismissed without the slightest evidence as a fairy tale or campfire story.  Of course, this doesn't explain how there are thousands of Flood/Ark stories by people groups around the world, including Native Americans and Australian Aborigines.fferent -- it requires NEW information to arise without any intelligent input.

US	50572801	R3DYF1EB6H1UC4	0060675187	946877738	Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism: A Bishop Rethinks the Meaning of Scripture	Books	1	37	95	N	N	Outdated atheistic attacks on Scripture	Spong was an Episcopalian Bishop who attack every doctrine he took an ordination vow to defend.  But instead of being pilloried for hypocrisy, he is hailed as an intellectual and a &quot;convincing scholar&quot; in almost every liberal pulpit and in all branches of the secular media.  But after reading Spong's works and hearing him speak on several occasions, I can understand at least one of the real reasons for Spong's popularity today.  He is one of our few green theologians, for he constantly recycles his material but presents it in new wrapping (which is itself recycled -- it nearly always says: &quot;A Bishop rethinks ...&quot;).<br />He is also a master of poisoning the well.  In Spong's world, works which support his view are described as &quot;well written and even brilliant works of biblical scholarship&quot;; whereas works supporting biblical inerrancy are &quot;tracts, pamphlets, and books from the pens of fundamentalist Christians&quot; (p. x).<br />His writings are littered with the words: &quot;I know of no biblical scholar [who disagrees with me]&quot;, e.g. &quot;No biblical scholar&quot; thinks that Adam was a historical figure&quot; (p. 104), &quot;I know of no one in the ranks of biblical scholarship&quot; who thinks that John wrote the Fourth Gospel (p. 193), &quot;I know of no reputable biblical scholar who takes these [Virgin] birth narratives literally&quot; (p. 215).  &quot;Fundamentalist&quot; is Spong's favourite religious swear-word of anyone who believes in the basic doctrines of Christianity.  According to him, we are &quot;afraid of knowledge&quot; (p. 27), incapable of abstract thought (p. 155), and are fearful and insecure Christians who do not even bother to read the Bible they pretend to defend (pp. 3-5, 79, 133, 217).  Not that Spong is in any position to know, since judging by his bibliography he's never bothered to read any of the countless evangelical scholars.<br />Spong is a master of dishonest language.  He claims that he is &quot;a Christian who loves the church&quot; (p. 10) and even loves the Bible (pp. 11, 14-15, 245, 247).  But he claims that the Bible is full of contradictions, errors, objectional passages and repugnant concepts (pp. 16-23).  He even claims that &quot;There are passages in the Gospels that portray Jesus of Nazareth as narrow-minded, vindictive, and even hypocritical.&quot; (p. 21)  Statements such as these appear strangely at odds with the claim that he loves the Bible.<br />Sometimes Spong even falsifies data to &quot;win&quot; a point.  For example, he is so obsessed with proving that Luke had a pro-Roman bias that he claims &quot;it was only in Luke's Gospel that we are told to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's&quot; (p. 176).  But the same passage is also found in Mt. 22:21 and Mk. 12:17.  For a man who claims that he is loves the Bible and is a world-class expert on it, this is just inexcusable.<br />There is nothing of substance in the book, just the rehash of typical canards of two-bit God-haters.  I can only present a few examples in a short review.<br />Spong raises the old flat earth canard, claiming that the Bible sometimes appears to refer to a moving sun and stationary earth (p. 26).  However, Spong, who has no scientific qualifications, is unaware that all motion must be described with respect to a reference frame.  For earthbound people, the earth is a convenient reference frame.  If he were consistent, he would have to object to car speedometers and road speed limit signs that are also calibrated with respect to the ground, and even modern astronomers refer to &quot;sunset&quot; and &quot;sunrise&quot;.<br />Spong's specific charges against Scripture can be easily rebutted, and here are two examples:<br />&quot;Yet in the Torah there are two creation stories that vary in detail and contradict each other in order (Gen. 1:1-2:4 and Gen. 2:5ff).  These stories cannot be harmonised. (p. 23)&quot;<br />Is it correct to claim that the stories &quot;cannot be harmonised.&quot;?  Has he even tried to harmonize them?  Kenneth Kitchen, a scholar of the ancient Near East, has successfully tried in Ancient Orient and the Old Testament (Chicago: IVP, 1966), pp. 116-7:<br />&quot;The strictly complementary nature of the 'two accounts' is plain enough: Genesis 1 mentions the creation of man as the last of a series, and without any details, whereas in Genesis 2 man is the centre of interest and more specific details are given about him and his setting. &quot;There is not incompatible duplication here at all.  Failure to recognize the complementary nature of the subject-distinction between a skeleton outline of all creation on the one hand, and the concentration in detail of man and his immediate environment on the other, borders on obscurantism.&quot;<br />Spong also alleges that Moses:<br />&quot;... seemed not to know the nationality of the people to whom Joseph's brothers sold Joseph, who took him down to Egypt.  In one version it was the Ishmaelites (Gen. 37:25), and in another version it was the Midianites (Gen. 37:28).  They are not the same.  Moses, as a single author, seems to have been quite confused.  (p. 23)&quot;<br />However, it is Spong who is quite confused.  Over a century ago, Haley's &quot;Alleged Discrepancies of the Bible&quot; cited Keil's suggestion that the caravan consisted of two tribes allied because of their common descent from Abraham (Gen. 16:16, 25:2) and similar lifestyle.

It would be correct to report that the soldier was captured by a patrol of Germans, but equally correct to report that he was captured by Italians, especially if the minority Italians distinguished themselves.<br /> Spong shows lack of imagination and poor scholarship, as he is unfamiliar with Bible-believing scholars who long ago answered all his &quot;points&quot;.

He has a knack of communicating deep material in an easy-to-understand way.  Where necessary, he analyzes the original Hebrew, and is erudite on Jewish interpretations of the passages.<br />It fills an important gap, because most Christians seem exclusively concerned with the New Testament, and forget about the Old Testament on which it rests.<br />His introduction is important, and warns against sensationalising, e.g. the claim that Jesus fulfilled over 300 prophecies at his first coming, when there are less than 100.  Another error is forgetting that the Bible is a progressive revelation of God's Messianic program, foreordained from eternity but worked out in history.  This results in falsely assuming NT understanding by OT saints who couldn't have had this.<br />The book provides many fascinating insights, e.g. into Genesis 4.  There is also deep analysis of well-known prophecies.  For example, he shows that Isaiah 7:14 was indeed prophesying a virginal conception of the Messiah, and that almah really does mean 'virgin' not 'young woman'.<br />Fruchtenbaum also shows that Isaiah 53 was really talking about the Messiah, as shown by the context.  It is provides vital apologetic for witnessing to non-Christian Jews, because he shows that the vast majority of Jewish commentators, including Maimonides, believed that the passage is Messianic.  The supposedly 'Jewish' view that it's referring to Israel is a fairly modern revisionist interpretation that was fiercely resisted by Rabbi Crispin as 'forced and far-fetched'.<br />There are also very valuable chapters about the plurality, unity and Triunity of the Godhead in the OT.  The appendices also have much of value, including Daniel's '70 sevens' prophecy, 'How did the Wise Men know?', 'How the NT quotes the OT' and 'Jewish Objections to Jesus'.<br />I am also a Hebrew Christian or Messianic Jew, and think this book is unexcelled for Jewish insights into Yeshua Hamashiach.  I think the only likely 'answers' to this book will be ad hominem, arbitrarily defining people like Fruchtenbaum and me as non-Jews, although we believe in the Jewish Messiah who fulfilled prophecies of the Hebrew Bible, and believe the New Testament also written entirely by Jews (including Luke!).nd 'Jewish Objections to Jesus'.<br />I am also a Hebrew Christian or Messianic Jew, and think this book is unexcelled for Jewish insights into Yeshua Hamashiach.

First, Fruchtenbaum documents what Jewish leaders say about Him.  Then there is a very well written and in-depth study of the famous Isaiah 53, analysing the text itself and Jewish interpretations throughout the ages.  The vast majority of Jewish commentators, including Maimonides, believed that the passage is Messianic.  The supposedly 'Jewish' view that it's referring to Israel is a fairly modern revisionist interpretation (started by Rashi) that was fiercely resisted by Rabbi Crispin as 'forced and far-fetched'.<br />The next chapter looks at other OT passages, and the following one shows how the NT compares with the OT.  While very deep, I strongly suggest that those wanting to find out more about the OT prophecies should read Fruchtenbaum's far more detailed book &quot;Messianic Christology&quot;, also available from Amazon.<br />The following one is the very important question of why the Messiah had to die as our Substitute for our salvation.<br />Then Fruchtenbaum deals with Jewish objections to Jesus, and provides correct definitions of the terms &quot;Jew&quot;, &quot;Gentile&quot; and &quot;Christian&quot;.  He shows that there are almost as many definitions of &quot;Jew&quot; as there are Jews!  So to define a Jew as a &quot;non-Jew&quot; or &quot;so-called Jew&quot; simply because he or she believes in the Jewish Messiah and believes a totally Jewish book is just a self-serving stipulative definition.  Fruchtenbaum presents the only definition that matters: the biblical one, that a Jew is a descendant of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, regardless of whether this person is a believer in Christ, an Orthodox Jew or an atheist.<br />It's indicative of anti-christian bigotry that some Orthodox Jews will call a Hebrew Christian like Dr Fruchtenbaum (or myself for that matter) a &quot;non-Jew&quot;, although we are descendants of Abraham, believe in one God and in the divine inspiration of the Old Testament; but somehow an atheist who believes none of these things is still recognised as a Jew (many Israelis are atheists).<br />For more information about such topics, I recommend Fruchtenbaum's &quot;Hebrew Christianity&quot;, also available from Amazon.<br />The last chapter contains testimony from Jews who have come to know Jesus as Messiah, Saviour and God.

Logic and reason are far from being incompatible with biblical Christianity.  Rather, they are essential.<br />Moreland's book goes a long way to address this common failing, and Christians can't help but benefit from his book.  It is almost essential for Christians studying at secular universities (what Dinesh De Souza called 'islands of repression in a sea of tolerance'), and probably even more so if they're at a nominally Christian one.  Moreland shows how to argue logically, and to see through the logical fallacies of many of the anti-christian philosophies pushed by many universities in the West.<br />Many anti-christian philosophies turn out to be self-refuting.  For example, the view: 'There is no truth' - this would mean that this sentence itself is not true.  And moral relativists attack the Christian view that some things are always right and others are always wrong.  Relativists effectively say: 'There are no moral absolutes, so we ought to be tolerant of other people's morals'.  Moreland points out that 'ought' implies a moral absolute that toleration is good.<br />Its main disadvantage is that Moreland is 'sixty-forty in favor of the old-earth position' (p.107), possibly because of a slight over-emphasis on extra-biblical revelation.	2000-11-28

Thus an overtly creationist paper will be rejected out of hand in most journals (and then they accuse creationists of being unscientific because they supposedly don't publish!).<br /><br />But a more insidious form of bias is in a publication that professes to give space for different views, but then selects the representatives deliberately to make sure that the desired straw man is set up.<br /><br />This is just the case with this book.  While the representatives of `progressive creationism' and theistic evolutionism were well-known advocates of their views, the representatives of young-earth creationism were virtually unknown to the major creationist organisations.  Failing to select the best representatives is hardly fair -- there are Ph.D. geologists, physicists, astronomers and theologians available who have strongly and publicly defended young-earth creationism -- but the powers-that-be selected two philosophers who made a very wimpy defence and scored several `own goals'.<br /><br />And the four evangelicals who responded to each view made it clear that they all favoured billions of years.  There was no young-earth believer among the respondents, and the lack of defence permitted by one side harks back to the first kind of bias.<br /><br />  An excellent review by hermeneutics specialist, Andrew Kulikovsky (Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal 14(1):23-27, 2000), documents some of the theological and scientific errors which unfortunately abound in the book.<br /><br />Edit 23 Dec 2012: several years after this review, I wrote [...]  A few years later, Howard van Till declared that he had abandoned Christianity completely, which is just being consistent.	2000-11-28

Mrs Kassian firmly upholds biblical authority,  and starts right at the beginning -- the creation of Adam and Even in  Genesis.  That is, both men and women were created in God's image, but both  sinned and were both cursed.<br />Kassian presents the Scriptural framework  for God's order in the home and the church: benevolent male headship and  female submission.  As Ephesians 5:24-25 says:<br />24 Now as the church  submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in  everything.<br />25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church  and gave himself up for her.<br />But Kassian also warns against shortcomings  by both sexes, e.g. male despotism and female rebellion.<br />Finally, she  applies relentless logic and sound analysis of the scriptures to refute  so-called 'biblical' feminism.  I see this aberration in the same way as  creation compromises (e.g. gap theory, day-age, theistic evolution): trying  to interpret the infallible Word of God by the fallible theories of sinful  human beings.<br />Be sure to get her subsequent book _The Feminist Gospel :  The Movement to Unite Feminism With the Church_  This shows, among other  things, how many of the first generation of 'biblical' feminists started by  'reinterpreting' God's word to fit fashionable feminist theory.  Later,  they slid further down the slippery slope into complete apostasy.<br />For a  very thorough and detailed refutation of 'biblical' feminism, I recommend  _Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood_ by Piper and Grudem.	2000-08-04

Yuri Averbakh (b. 1922) was probably one of the world's top dozen players in the 1950s.  He qualified for the immensely  strong Candidates tournament at Zrich, 1953 (10th), and convincingly won  the USSR Championship the following year, and narrowly lost the playoff  after a tie in 1956.  As he points out, chess is a lot different now, but  there were many fine players and great games from that era.<br />But it's not  surprising that this book took so long in coming.  Averbakh had his finger  in almost every chess pie, as a Judge of Chess Compositions, leading  endgame theoretician, President of the USSR Chess Federation, magazine  editor, author and trainer.  I myself have benefited from his training at a  chess seminar in Sukhumi, and Australasia benefited from two visits in the  1960s, when he dominated the tournaments he played in.  It must be said  that he was a product of the Soviet system to a large extent -- see my  review of _The Soviet School of Chess_.<br />Averbakh had a fairly high  percentage of draws in his career, and as he says, had a reputation as a  technician.  But he hoped to show that he had a universal style by  presenting games decided in other ways.<br />Indeed, the technical skill shows  up well in his white-square exploitation against Najdorf, and an endgame  with a knight sacrifice against Euwe at Zrich, 1953; or blocking out an  enemy knight against Bannik, which won him the Soviet Title in 1954.  But  there are also fierce battles with oppositely castled kings against  Bronstein, Taimanov and Petrosyan; a devastating opening innovation against  a World Correspondence Champion which Averbakh saved for 18 years; and some  classic wins, such as against Panno, with his patented 'Averbakh variation'  against the King's Indian, still a dangerous weapon.  Other scalps include  Botvinnik, Smyslov, Keres and Korchnoi.<br />It's also nice to see a book  where annotations are in clear and interesting prose rather than Informator  symbols.  The publishers Cadogan are to be congratulated on an excellently  produced book which does the contents justice.see a book  where annotations are in clear and interesting prose rather than Informator  symbols.

That is, he makes uniformitarian (i.e. essentially materialistic, billions of  years, etc.) 'science' his authority over Scripture.  This means that he  must try to fit billions of years into Scripture, with corollaries of a  local flood and pre-Adamite soulless man-like creatures, and death of  nephesh animals before sin.  The only real difference between the two  positions is that Ross denies transformism, the changing of one kind into  another (in fact, Ross goes to the absurd extreme of almost endorsing  'fixity of species').  Amazingly, Ross claims that his approach is 'a  literal reading of the Genesis creation chapters' (p. 86) - surely a very  non-literal usage of the word 'literal'!<br />The worst part is the gross  liberties Ross takes with the scriptural text, to fit the canonical 66  books into what he calls the '67th book', nature (really, the  uniformitarian *interpretation* of nature).  However, the creation is  cursed (Genesis 3:17-19, Romans 8:20-22) and man's heart is deceitful  (Jeremiah 17:9) and the thinking of a godless man is 'futile' (Romans  1:21), while Scripture itself is 'God-breathed' (2 Timothy 3:15-17).  So a  biblical Christian should not re-interpret the perfect, unfallen Word of  God according to fallible theories of sinful humans about a world we know  to be cursed (Genesis 3:17-19, Romans 8:20-22).<br />Ross's earlier  theological and historical errors have been thoroughly rebutted  point-by-point by Van Bebber and Taylor's book 'Creation and Time: A Report  on Progressive Creationist Book by Hugh Ross'.  This is essential reading  for defenders of the biblical world-view.  It's disturbing to see that Ross  repeats many of the same errors in 'The Genesis Question'.  This includes  citing the 'Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament' to claim the exact  opposite of what it says!<br />Ross repeats fallacious Hebrew arguments,  including his nonsensical claim about a continuing 7th day - refuted by the  Hebrew scholar Dr Douglas Kelly in 'Creation and Change' (available from  Amazon).<br />Ross's ignorance of Hebrew shows when he tries to discredit the  common creationist identification of behemoth in Job 40:15 ff. with a  sauropod, because he believes the dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years  ago.  Ross writes (p. 48): 'The Hebrew word for &quot;behemoth&quot;  appears in its plural form, behema, ...'   However, even beginners in Hebrew  know that -a is often a feminine singular and -oth is a feminine plural.   So Ross got it *back-to-front*: behema is the singular form, while behemoth  is grammatically plural.  It is a figure of speech known as an *intensive  plural* or *plural of majesty*, where 'the referent is a singular  individual, which is, however, so thoroughly characterized by the qualities  of the noun that a plural is used', 'beast of beasts'.  The context says  that behemoth is the largest beast God made.  And Job 40:17 says: 'His tail  sways like a cedar' which certainly doesn't fit Ross's suggestion of a  hippopotamus (unless it was a bonsai cedar, maybe).<br />While Genesis clearly  teaches that the sun, moon and stars were created on Day 4 after the Earth,  Ross asserts that what really happened on the fourth 'day' was that the sun  and other heavenly bodies 'appeared' when a dense cloud layer dissipated  after millions of years. This is both fanciful science and bad Hebrew  exegesis.  The Hebrew word 'asah means 'make' throughout Genesis 1, and may  be used interchangeably with 'create' (bara'), e.g. in Genesis 1:26-27.  It  is pure desperation to apply a different meaning to the *same word* in the  *same grammatical construction* in the *same passage*, just to fit in with  atheistic evolutionary ideas.  If God had *meant* 'appeared', then He  presumably would have *used* the Hebrew word for appear (ra'ah), as when  the dry land 'appeared' as the waters gathered in one place on Day 3  (Genesis 1:9).  This is supported by Hebrew scholars who have translated  the Bible into English.  Over 20 major translations were checked, and all  clearly teach that the sun, moon and stars were made on the fourth  day.<br />Ross often treats creationists unfairly, by parroting arguments from  atheistic sceptics that creationists had refuted long ago.  E.g., Ross  claims that it would be impossible to 'pitch' the Ark without millions of  years for petroleum products to accumulate (pp. 153-154).   Dr Tas Walker  pointed out *15 years ago* that pitch need not be made from petroleum at  all - the pitch-making industries in Europe made pitch from pine resin for  centuries (article posted on AiG website long before Ross wrote his book,  so there is no excuse).  And _The New Encyclopdia Britannica_ says about  naval pitch: 'Oleoresin, also called gum or pitch ... is extracted from the  pine.'<br />Ross also parrots the claim that there is too much coal in the  earth's crust to have been formed in the Flood (pp. 151-154).  Even worse,  as 'evidence' he cites some calculations from Schnknecht and Scherer, Too  much coal for a young earth?, _CEN Tech. J._ 11(3)278-282, 1997 (also on  AiG website).  However, the whole point of this paper was to *solve* that  problem, by showing evidence that much coal had formed from large floating  ecosystems comprising arboreal lycopods, which had been catastrophically  buried by water.  Ross also *omitted the question mark* when citing the  title, thus further conveying to his readers the *diametrically opposite  meaning* to the paper's intention.  Also, John Woodmorappe had shown long  ago that vegetation living at the start of the Flood was not the only  possible source of carbonaceous material which had eventually transformed  into coal.  There were ~1656 years between the Creation and Flood, enabling  much peat to form, which could have been buried by the Flood and easily  transformed into coal since.<br />I couldn't possibly cover everything wrong  with _The Genesis Question_ on an Amazon review.  But there is more info in  my review in the _Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal_ 13(2):22-30, 1998  (posted on both the Answers in Genesis and True Origins websites).	2000-05-05

A historic milestone in chess literature.	Siegbert Tarrasch won a string of tournament victories in the early 1890s, making him arguably the best player in the world.  But he passed up the opportunity to play the aging Steinitz (against whom he had +3-0) for the  world title. So Lasker won the title instead in 1895, and forever after put  Tarrasch in the shade, although he was still in the world's top five for  another 20 years.<br />Tarrasch was also a great chess teacher.  However,  his  writings can be very dogmatic, and his comments on some opening seem rather  humourous in their naivety to modern masters.  His writings seemed designed  to make chess seem simpler and more rule-based than it really is.  IM John  Watson's brilliant book _Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy_ goes into this  in far more detail.<br />It's very obvious that chess has progressed immensely  in 100 years.  So while this book is very instructive, it must be read with  some caution.  But it is a very important classic, that it's a pity that it  hasn't been part of the learning English-speaking player's reading list  until now.  On the other hand, it was translated into Russian at least 12  years ago, since I gladly purchased a copy when I was there in 1988 despite  my very limited Russian.<br />And it must be said that he was not nearly so  dogmatic in his play as in his writings.  There are a number of examples of  almost Nimzovitchian ideas.<br />One instructive moment is his analysis of his  victory on the Black side of the Advance French against Paulsen.  After the  standard moves 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 c5 4 c3 Nc6 5 Nf3 Qb6 6 Bd3, Tarrasch  gives his next move 6 ... cxd4 an exclamation mark, and points out that 6  ... Bd7 allows 7 dxc5.  Yet almost everyone, even Watson, thinks that  Tarrasch's great rival Nimzovitch was such a radical when he played this  against Salwe many years later!	2000-04-03

I have the book edited by Godfrey in my University days and wasn't impressed.  And this is often regarded as one of the best anti-creationist books around.  Note that many other anti-creationist books like Strahler's  rely heavily on Godfrey in many places.  But they have to be pretty  desperate if Godfrey's is the best they have.<br />As a Ph.D. chemist, I was  incensed at the arrant pseudoscientific nonsense presented by one  contributor to pretend that life could have evolved from non-living  chemicals.<br />For example, in trying to explain how the exclusively  'left-handed' amino acids in living organisms could arise by chance, he  claimed: 'From the start of their [Transfer RNA synthetases'] existence,  they probably bound only L-amino acids.'  This is just hand-waving -- he  never explains how such complicated enzymes could have functioned unless  they were themselves exclusively left-handed, or how they would operate  before RNA was composed of homochiral ribose.<br />Money would be better  spent on Dr Duane Gish's 450 page book _Creation Scientists Answer Their  Critics_ (Available from Amazon), which includes a 116-page chapter  'Science confronts evolutionists', responding specifically to the Godfrey  book.	2000-03-31

Numbers made it clear that used the Yellowstone petrified 'forests' as an excuse to  abandon creationism and his professed faith in biblical Christianity.  His  bias should be noted when reading his book.<br /><br />One irony is that many  uniformitarian scientists now believe that the Yellowstone were not a  succession of forests which were buried in situ, but were catastrophically  uprooted and transported as a floating log mat, and later the logs sank  root-end first into the lake bottom.  See the Answers in Genesis  site.<br /><br />Numbers' book majors heavily on personalities, with subtle (and  some not-so-subtle) character assassinations, while the high scientific  qualifications of many creationists are downplayed.  He invariably gives  the last word to the evolutionist, which often leaves an impression  contrary to the facts as can be seen upon checking the original sources.  See also review by Prof. Edgar Andrews, _Origins_ (Journal of the Biblical  Creation Society) 8(20):21-23, 1995.<br /><br />Many atheists and their compromising  evangelical lackeys have followed Numbers' ploy of attributing biblical  creationism and flood geology to 'the visions of an Adventist prophetess  [Ellen White]' via George McCready Price.  A number of papers by Dr Terry  Mortenson in the _Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal_ show that the early  19th century Scriptural Geologists presented such ideas well before Price.  And the founder of Answers in Genesis (USA), Ken Ham, pointed out that he  had never even heard of Price at the time he founded CSF/AiG, and that he  adopted creationism because of the biblical teaching.<br /><br />Even Henry Morris's naive off-the-cuff \\"endorsement\\" of this book can't change the incontrovertable FACTS of history: that YEC was the historic view of the Christian Church from LONG before Ellen White -- Basil the Great, Martin Luther and John Calvin all believed in 6 literal days, and even allegorisers like Origen and Augustine furiously denounced pagan ideas that claimed the earth was older than 6-10 thousand year.<br /><br />Note that even if  Numbers were right about Price, he and all those whon gleefully parrot him  are wrong to think that discrediting Price is enough to refute creationism  -- this is a classic case of the genetic fallacy.<br /><br />One useful thing in his  book is that he exposes the 'strained efforts' of re-interpreting Scripture  to fit evolution, and the deceit of some theistic evolutionary college  professors '[s]tretching the truth to the breaking point' (p. 182) when  trying to hide what they really believed from conservative parents and  donors.-- Basil the Great, Martin Luther and John Calvin all believed in 6 literal days, and even allegorisers like Origen and Augustine furiously denounced pagan ideas that claimed the earth was older than 6-10 thousand year. <br /> <br />Note that even if  Numbers were right about Price, he and all those whon gleefully parrot him  are wrong to think that discrediting Price is enough to refute creationism  -- this is a classic case of the genetic fallacy. <br /> <br />One useful thing in his  book is that he exposes the 'strained efforts' of re-interpreting Scripture  to fit evolution, and the deceit of some theistic evolutionary college  professors '[s]tretching the truth to the breaking point' (p. 182) when  trying to hide what they really believed from conservative parents and  donors.	2000-03-31

Books	1	72	99	N	N	Typical compromising evangelical local flood compromise	Authors like Woodrow who promote local flood and long age compromises can be summarised as follows:<br />&quot;'Science' has shown that the earth is billions of years old, therefore the plain meaning of Scripture must be  re-interpreted to fit these 'facts'.  If we [with our finite understanding]  can't explain a clear biblical teaching, it follows that no explanation is  possible, so we must re-interpret this also.&quot;<br />However, they fail to  realise that science deals with repeatable observations in the *present*,  while billions of years ideas are based on assumptions about the  unobservable, unrepeatable *past*.  Thus science can never show the world  is billions of years old.  Rather, we should rely on the eye-witness of One  who was there, knows everything, and never lies or errs.  But Woodrow et  al. rely on the testimony of people who weren't there, often err and  sometimes lie.  So they are using the theories of fallible people to  interpret the Word of the infallible God.<br />We should realise that  different biases can result in different *interpretations* of the *same*  data.  For example, great thicknesses of rock layers could conceivably be  produced either by a little water over long periods, or a lot of water over  short periods.  Because sedimentation usually occurs slowly today, it is  assumed that it must have always occurred slowly.  If so, then the rock  layers must have formed over vast ages.  The philosophy that processes have  always occurred at roughly constant rates ('the present is the key to the  past') is often called uniformitarianism.<br />I show how presuppositions  strongly influence explanations about the past in my book Refuting  Evolution, and this also contains a chapter on evidence for a 'young' earth  and global Flood.<br />It's sad to see professing evangelical writers fall  into the errors that characterise the 'scoffers' prophesied in 2 Peter 3:  'all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.'  Peter reveals the huge flaw of the uniformitarian scoffers: they are  'willingly ignorant' of special creation by God and a cataclysmic  globe-covering (and fossil-forming) flood.<br />To answer some of Woodrow's  specific anti-global-flood arguments:<br />* The word &quot;erets&quot;  translated as earth (Gen. 6:17, 7:19-23) sometimes refers to limited land  areas.<br />However, erets is also used in Gen. 1:1-2, where it must refer to  the whole earth.  It also fits in with 2 Peter 3:6, where the 'world' was  deluged (Greek katakluzo, from which we derive the word cataclysm) by  water.  Here the Flood is described in universal terms, and paralleled with  the coming universal judgment. _Erets_ is often used to refer to the entire  dry land surface, e.g. Gen. 1:10ff.<br />*Woodrow says that the phrase in Gen.  7:19,20 &quot;under the whole heavens&quot; is often used in a limited way  e.g. Deut. 2:25.<br />But no one denies that such phrases are sometimes used  in a limited way, or that 'all' is sometimes less than universal.  But in  the Flood account, God is going out of his way to emphasize the  universality of the Flood -- from Genesis 7, NIV: 19 They rose greatly on  the earth, and *all* the high mountains under the *entire* heavens were  covered. 20 The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more  than twenty feet. 21 *Every* living thing that moved on the earth perished  -- birds, livestock, wild animals, *all* the creatures that swarm over the  earth, and *all* mankind. 22 *Everything* on dry land that had the breath  of life in its nostrils died. 23 *Every* living thing on the face of the  earth was wiped out; men and animals and the creatures that move along the  ground and the birds of the air were wiped from the earth. *Only* Noah was  left, and those with him in the ark. Question: just suppose, for the sake  of the argument, that God had wanted to teach a global flood -- how could  He have said it more clearly than in Gen. 7?<br />*Woodrow argues that it  would require 726 feet of rain per day for 40 days to cover the  mountains.<br />But this assumes that the mountain were at their present  height.  However, much uplift happened during and shortly after the Flood  (Ps. 104:8, 'The mountains rose; the valleys sank down' as the NASB  correctly translates it).  This is because of the catastrophic earth  movements and huge amounts of still-unconsolidated sediments.  Woodrow  never bothered to find out what creationists actually teach, so set up a  straw man, here and many other places.  As computer programmers say,  'garbage in, garbage out'.<br />* Another straw man: cold and thin air above  Mt. Everest?<br />Again, faulty assumption.  Also, Woodrow is ignorant of the  fact that air pressure depends on the height of the air column over the  earth, relative to the main sea level, not altitude as such.  Thus even if  the Ark was above the mountains, because the sea level was also higher, the  pressure would have been almost normal.<br />*Woodrow has a whole chapter  claiming that Ark's crew could not have cared for all the  animals.<br />Woodrow slavishly follows the usual bibliosceptical ploys,  assuming that the animals needed to be taken care of, one at a time.  But  plenty of labour-saving mechanisms would have been available to the crew of  eight, for example, long sloping troughs for both food and water that could  have been loaded from only a few central filling stations.  There are also  systems to deal with waste, e.g. sloped or slatted floors; very deep,  absorbent bedding; vermicomposting.<br />Don't waste your money on Woodrow's  book -- buy John Woodmorappe's scholarly and comprehensive book _Noah's  Ark: A Feasibility Study_ for thorough demolition of all attacks on the Ark  by atheists and their compromising evangelical lackeys.

Books	1	34	61	N	N	Pretentious pseudo-scholarship from a dog-collared atheist	Basically, as in all his books, Spong proclaims from his loftyperch that miracles are not possible, so don't bother trying to confuse him with the evidence.<br />Instead, Spong must `demythologise' then `remythologise' the resurrection narratives.<br />Spong's view presents a Christ who is a failure; the truly good man who was defeated by a cruel death.  Bishop Richard Holloway of Edinburgh (himself quite liberal) rightly comments:<br /> `Spong leaves us with a God who cannot save because he has no control of nature or history.  He offers us a dead Messiah who only \\"lives\\" because of the wishful thinking of his first disciples.'<br />It's no wonder that liberal churches which deny the resurrection are shrinking, while conservative (including `fundamentalist') churches which accept the resurrection are the only ones growing.  Spong laments this fact (p. 13), but he fails to see what most unbelievers can: that going to church is a waste of time if the resurrection is a hoax.  They can find better sources of platitudes without the semantic gymnastics.<br />It doesn't seem to bother Spong that he pontificates about science despite a complete lack of scientific qualifications.<br />As usual, he ties himself in logical knots, e.g. on pp.  34-35 he claims:<br /> `No word is objective; hence no word ever passes from the lips of one person into the hearing of another without being changed in meaning. ... Words are never the truth.  They are only the medium of truth ... Words become the vehicles by which experiences are shared.'<br />Yet Spong wants us to believe that *his* words are true and that fundamentalists are most certainly wrong.  Such absolute and certain statements sound strange from a bishop who condemns a church for prescribing certainty and absolutes.<br />Spong and liberal scholars usually argue that the Gospels were written long after the events they claim to record. Therefore they cannot be trusted to be reliable, because no eye-witnesses were around to correct false reports.<br />However, Spong appears to be unaware of the cogent arguments of J.A.T. Robinson, who was a fellow liberal and Bishop of Woolwich, for redating the Gospels between 40 and 65 AD.  It is ironic that Spong sees himself as a spiritual heir to Robinson (p. 13), yet ignores his conservative early datings of the NT.<br />Spong claims the gospels contradict themselves about the time between Christ's burial and resurrection (Ch. 17). Christ was buried at about 6pm Good Friday (Lk. 23:54) and rose on the `first day of the week' (Mk. 16:9) or `on the third day' (1 Cor. 15:4).  Spong claims that this contradicts Mt. 12:40: `three days and three nights'.  He overlooks that Jews distinguished the word `day' in the sense of daylight hours from `day' as 24 hour cycle, by referring to the latter as `night and a day'.  Further, in Jewish counting, a part of a day was counted as a whole day, e.g. 1 Sam.  30:12, where `he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and nights' is equated in v. 13 with _hayyôm sheloshah_ (`three days ago') which could only mean `day before yesterday'.<br />Spong could also benefit from the NT Greek scholar John Wenham's book _Easter Enigma_, which comprehensively solves all the other alleged contradictions in the Resurrection accounts.<br />The most glaring proof of his scholarly incompetence is on pp. 53-55, where Spong draws our attention to Gal.  1:15-16a which says:<br />`But when He who had set me apart, even from my mother's womb, called me through His grace, was pleased to reveal His son in me ...'<br />From v. 16, `to reveal His son in me', Spong claims:<br /> `This was not a physical body recalled from the grave.  The word for \\"reveal\\" in this text is _ophthe_, the same word used in the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures to describe the appearances of God (theophanies) or angels of God (angelophanies). ... What was the nature of a theophany?  Was it really \\"physical\\"?  What was the means of hearing God's voice speak?  Was it audible to any ear?  Was it capable of being recorded or objectified?'<br />Spong is wrong about _ophthe_, because it is often used in the NT in an objective sense. But even worse, the Greek word for `reveal' in Gal. 1:16 is actually _apokalupsai_, not _ophthe_!<br />It is shocking to see that Spong was trying to attack traditional Christian belief by appealing to a mis-translation of a Greek word which is not even in the passage on which he is pontificating!<br />Roman Catholic scholar, Prof. Gerald O'Collins was undoubtedly referring to this blunder when he wrote: `What is said about a key verb St. Paul uses in Gal. 1:15f.  shows that the bishop [Spong] has forgotten any Greek that he knew.' Spong should have heeded O'Collins' kindly `advice for his next book [which] is to let some real experts check it before publication.'<br />Prof. O'Collins' also stated that Spong's `work simply does not belong to the world of international scholarship.  No genuine scholar will be taken in by this book...ing God's voice speak?  Was it audible to any ear?

The only real difference between the two  positions is that Ross denies transformism, the changing of one kind into  another (in fact, Ross goes to the absurd extreme of almost endorsing  `fixity of species').<br />Amazingly, Ross claims that his approach is `a  literal reading of the Genesis creation chapters' (p. 86) - surely a very  non-literal usage of the word `literal'!<br />The worst part is the gross  liberties Ross takes with the scriptural text, to fit the canonical 66  books into what he calls the `67th book', nature (really, the  uniformitarian *interpretation* of nature).  However, the creation is  cursed (Genesis 3:17-19, Romans 8:20-22) and man's heart is deceitful  (Jeremiah 17:9) and the thinking of a godless man is `futile' (Romans  1:21), while Scripture itself is `God-breathed' (2 Timothy 3:15-17).  So a  biblical Christian should not re-interpret the perfect, unfallen Word of  God according to fallible theories of sinful humans about a world we know  to be cursed (Genesis 3:17-19, Romans 8:20-22).<br />Ross's earlier  theological and historical errors have been thoroughly rebutted  point-by-point by Van Bebber and Taylor's book `Creation and Time: A Report  on Progressive Creationist Book by Hugh Ross'.  This is essential reading  for defenders of the biblical world-view.  It's disturbing to see that Ross  repeats many of the same errors in `The Genesis Question'.  This includes  citing the `Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament' to claim the exact  opposite of what it says!<br />Ross repeats fallacious Hebrew arguments,  including his nonsensical claim about a continuing 7th day - refuted by the  Hebrew scholar Dr Douglas Kelly in `Creation and Change' (available from  Amazon).<br />Ross's ignorance of Hebrew shows when he tries to discredit the  common creationist identification of behemoth in Job 40:15 ff. with a  sauropod, because he believes the dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years  ago.  Ross writes (p. 48): `The Hebrew word for \\"behemoth\\" appears in its  plural form, behema, ...'  However, even beginners in Hebrew know that -a is  often a feminine singular and -oth is a feminine plural.  So Ross got it  *back-to-front*: behema is the singular form, while behemoth is  grammatically plural.  It is a figure of speech known as an *intensive  plural* or *plural of majesty*, where `the referent is a singular  individual, which is, however, so thoroughly characterized by the qualities  of the noun that a plural is used', `beast of beasts'.  The context says  that behemoth is the largest beast God made.  And Job 40:17 says: `His tail  sways like a cedar' which certainly doesn't fit Ross's suggestion of a  hippopotamus (unless it was a bonsai cedar, maybe).<br />While Genesis clearly  teaches that the sun, moon and stars were created on Day 4 after the Earth,  Ross asserts that what really happened on the fourth `day' was that the sun  and other heavenly bodies `appeared' when a dense cloud layer dissipated  after millions of years. This is both fanciful science and bad Hebrew  exegesis.  The Hebrew word `asah means `make' throughout Genesis 1, and may  be used interchangeably with `create' (bara'), e.g. in Genesis 1:26-27.  It  is pure desperation to apply a different meaning to the *same word* in the  *same grammatical construction* in the *same passage*, just to fit in with  atheistic evolutionary ideas.  If God had *meant* `appeared', then He  presumably would have *used* the Hebrew word for appear (ra'ah), as when  the dry land `appeared' as the waters gathered in one place on Day 3  (Genesis 1:9).  This is supported by Hebrew scholars who have translated  the Bible into English.  Over 20 major translations were checked, and all  clearly teach that the sun, moon and stars were made on the fourth  day.<br />Ross often treats creationists unfairly, by parroting arguments from  atheistic sceptics that creationists had refuted long ago.  E.g., Ross  claims that it would be impossible to `pitch' the Ark without millions of  years for petroleum products to accumulate (pp. 153-154).  Dr Tas Walker  pointed out *15 years ago* that pitch need not be made from petroleum at  all - the pitch-making industries in Europe made pitch from pine resin for  centuries (article posted on AiG website long before Ross wrote his book,  so there is no excuse).  And The New Encyclopædia Britannica says about  naval pitch: `Oleoresin, also called gum or pitch ... is extracted from the  pine.'<br />Ross also parrots the claim that there is too much coal in the  earth's crust to have been formed in the Flood (pp. 151-154).  Even worse,  as `evidence' he cites some calculations from Sch&ouml;nknecht and Scherer, Too  much coal for a young earth?, CEN Tech. J. 11(3)278-282, 1997 (also on AiG  website).  However, the whole point of this paper was to *solve* that  problem, by showing evidence that much coal had formed from large floating  ecosystems comprising arboreal lycopods, which had been catastrophically  buried by water.  Ross also *omitted the question mark* when citing the  title, thus further conveying to his readers the *diametrically opposite  meaning* to the paper's intention.  Also, John Woodmorappe had shown long  ago that vegetation living at the start of the Flood was not the only  possible source of carbonaceous material which had eventually transformed  into coal.  There were ~1656 years between the Creation and Flood, enabling  much peat to form, which could have been buried by the Flood and easily  transformed into coal since.<br />I couldn't possibly cover everything wrong  with `The Genesis Question' on an Amazon review.

A  cynic might claim that this gives him a win-win situation -- if he wins,  the game is heralded, while if he loses it's put down to his choice of  opening (I think a GM has made this point but I can't recall  who).<br />Indeed, Basman is an International Master so is a strong player, so  is bound to have netted some scalps.<br />In the 1992 New Zealand  Championship, the defending champion played the Grob (or reversed Grob) in  every game.  He was clearly strong enough to extricate himself sometimes  from a number of the messes he got himself into.  But still he scored only  50% although he would clearly have been one of the favorites, and this was  flattering for the opening.<br />In a review of the opening in Spectator some  years ago, Grandmaster Raymond Keene claimed that the Grob had to about the  worst first move on the board, except maybe h4.  It does nothing for  development or the center, commits more time to be lost by h3 in Basman's  line, and weakens the K-side.  And Keene backed up his judgement by a  severe thrashing of Basman, which he noted was unlikely to appear in  pro-Grob books ...<br />I couldn't give a book only one star, when it has  such entertainment value, and might even help a few club players net some  points.  But be warned: the novelty will wear off, and it will be necessary  to learn a proper opening.<br />When I see the opening used in 2600+ events,  then I might revise my opinion.  I really doubt that I'll need to change my  mind.	1999-12-13

This is why I've given it two stars.  Names like Botvinnik, Smyslov, Keres, should give you an idea of  the ultra-high class.<br />But I certainly couldn't have given it any more  stars, because of the shameless Soviet propagandizing.  It's difficult to  believe that Kotov could have believed it himself.  After all, in  tournaments (e.g. Groningen 1946 and the Z&uuml;rich 1953 Candidates), he  defeated the leading Soviet players when they were in danger of being  caught by foreigners.  Clearly he was too honorable to throw the  games.<br />It's really a joke claiming Alekhine as a true Soviet when he  couldn't leave the new USSR quickly enough.  It's more subtle but equally  farcical to praise Chigorin and denigrate Tarrasch, when their hard-fought  tied match in 1893 demonstrated that they were about even.<br />Finally, the  whole title is absurd, as Larsen pointed out long ago - how could Tal and  Petrosyan be part of the same `school'?<br />Actually, during the Gorbachev  era, I was privileged to attend a Chess Seminar in Sukhumi, Georgia/Gruzia  (then Georgian/Gruzinskaya SSR).  The introductory lecturer (and a good  one) GM Yuri Averbakh, former president of the USSR Chess Federation,  outlined the history of chess theory.  He attempted to explain away  Larsen's remark by claiming that the Soviet School referred to a method of  preparation.  But in so doing, he committed the fallacy of equivocation -  he had clearly previously been using the term `school' to refer to a  definite chess style, e.g. `Italian School', `Classical School',  `Hypermodern School'.<br />Unfortunately, even during glaznost it seemed that  people were afraid to speak the truth.  This didn't stop me from enjoying  my time in the USSR immensely and learning from these undisputed experts.	1999-12-13

But there are still subtle digs at  Bible-believing Christians.  Even more significant is the list of overtly  atheistic books in the `recommended reading' section.  For example,  Dawkins' `The Blind Watchmaker', which explicitly states that Darwin made  it possible to be `an intellectually fulfilled atheist' as he says he is;  Dennett's `Darwin's Dangerous Idea', which praises the `universal acid' of  Darwinism, eating away `just about every traditional concept', and says  that religions should be caged like dangerous wild animals; many books by  the humanist publisher Prometheus Books.<br />As astute commentators like  Phillip Johnson have noted, the common strategy of the leading evolutionary  propagandists is to dull people into compromise positions like `God might  have used evolution', but then make sure people, once sucked in, find out  what evolution really means.  They must have a good laugh at the  gullibility of compromising men of the cloth, just like Lenin with his  `useful idiots' in the West.<br />A recent survey published in the leading  science journal Nature conclusively showed that the National Academy of  Science, the producers of `Teaching about Evolution ...', is heavily biased  against God, rather than religiously unbiased. [E.J. Larson and L. Witham,  The sole criterion for being classified as a `leading' or `greater'  scientist was membership of the NAS.]  A survey of all 517 NAS members in  biological and physical sciences resulted in just over half responding.  72.2 % were overtly atheistic, 20.8 % agnostic, and only 7.0 % believed in  a personal God.  Belief in God and immortality was lowest among biologists.  It is likely that those who didn't respond were unbelievers as well, so  the study probably underestimates the level of anti-God belief in the NAS.  The percentage of unbelief is far higher than the percentage among U.S.  scientists in general, or in the whole U.S. population.<br />Commenting on the  professed religious neutrality of `Teaching about Evolution ...', the  many outstanding members of this academy who are very religious people,  people who believe in evolution, many of them biologists.\\"  Our research  suggests otherwise.'<br />The atheistic bias of NAS is reflected in the many  scientifically inaccurate and even misleading comments in this book.  It's  not surprising, since Alberts himself has prominently cited Haeckel's  forged work on embryonic drawings in his `Molecular Biology of the Cell',  Garland, NY, 1994, pp. 32-33, although to be fair to him, this century-old  fraud wasn't fully exposed till after that book was written.<br />Less  excusable is the diagram of the alleged transitional forms between land  mammals and whales.  This displays all the animals at the same size, and  neglects to inform its readers that the last animal is ten times longer  than the first!  There are also deceptive straw-man caricatures about what  creationists really believe.<br />My own book, `Refuting Evolution', was  written to counteract the misinformation in this book, in a number of  areas, as well as giving a concise statement of the creationist view, which  the atheistic &eacute;lites want to censor.  I discuss facts and bias, pointing  out that facts never speak for themselves, but are always interpreted via a  framework, and that atheists are just as biased as creationists.  The  examples of variation within a kind presented by Teaching about Evolution ...  have *nothing to do* with particles-to-people evolution. `Teaching about  Evolution ...' persistently misrepresents creationists of believing in fixity  of species.  But creationists don't deny change per se, merely changes  which increase the genetic information content, as particles-to-people  evolutionary dogma requires but real, empirical, information theory  denies.<br />There are also chapters on birds and whales, going far deeper  than the simplistic treatment in `Teaching about Evolution ...', showing that  they are exquisitely designed.  For example, evolutionists still have no  explanation for how the unique bird's lung, with air sacs, parabronchi and  a counter-current exchange system, could have evolved from the bellows-type  reptilian lung.<br />The astronomy and age of the earth chapters tackle the  erroneous big bang and billions-of-years arguments, pointing out key  problems that the NAS doesn't want schoolchildren to know about.<br />A  chapter on the fossil record documents that the links are still missing.  `Teaching about Evolution' contains a gleeful article by the evolutionist  (and atheist) E.O. Wilson, `Discovery of a Missing Link'.  He claimed to  have studied `nearly exact intermediates between solitary wasps and the  highly social modern ants'.  But another atheistic evolutionist, W.B.  Provine, says that Wilson's `assertions are explicitly denied by the text....  Wilson's comments are misleading at best.'<br />The last chapter defends the  design explanation as legitimate, in contrast to Teaching about Evolution  ...' which rules it out a priori (i.e. as a dogma, before even examining the  evidence).people  evolutionary dogma requires but real, empirical, information theory  denies.<br />There are also chapters on birds and whales, going far deeper  than the simplistic treatment in `Teaching about Evolution ...', showing that  they are exquisitely designed.

Although many modern theologians claim that Genesis is  poetry, it has none of the hallmarks of Hebrew poetry, such as parallelism.  Dr Kelly backs this up by sound linguistic analysis.  He quotes an earlier  authority as saying:<br />'the man who says &#34;I believe that Genesis  purports to be a historical account, but I do not believe that  account&#34; is a far better interpreter of the Bible than the man who  says, 'I believe that Genesis is profoundly true, but it is  poetry.'<br />Also, Dr Kelly painstakingly documents the history of  interpretation of Genesis, and shows that the almost uniform view  throughout the church era was that it was intended to mean what it said.  Long age and theistic evolutionary interpretations were invented only after  long ages/evolutionary views became fashionable.  That is, the interpreters  were trying to read things from outside Scripture into the text.  So they  ceased to regard Scripture as authoritative, so were effectively if  unwittingly contradicting Christ, e.g. John 10:35.  Instead, they regarded  man's (fallible) interpretation of nature as authoritative.  How can anyone  be a consistent follower of Christ if he denies what Christ believed about  Scripture, including Genesis 1 and 2 (see Matthew 19:3-6, Mark  10:2-9)?<br />Dr Kelly quotes not only evangelicals, but liberals like the  19th century exegete Prof. Marcus Dods, who wrote that any interpretations  of Genesis 1:1-2:4 that deny the straightforward meaning were 'futile and  mischievous', and that they:<br />'do violence to Scripture [and] foster a  style of interpretation by which the text is forced to say what the  interpreter desires.'<br />Dods also said,<br />'if, for example, the word  &#34;day&#34; in these chapters does not mean a period of twenty-four  hours, the interpretation of Scripture is hopeless.'<br />We can see the  results in seminary after seminary -- when one generation denied the plain  meaning of the creation account, the next generation or two denied the  plain meaning of the accounts of Christ's bodily resurrection and virginal  conception.<br />Dr Kelly is highly qualified to write about the theological  aspects of Genesis -- he is Professor of Systematic Theology at Reformed  Theological Seminary, Charlotte, North Carolina.  Although he is not a  scientist himself, he augments his case with examples of design in biology  expounded by people like the biochemicst Dr Michael Behe.  The main  materialistic argument against Behe has nothing to do with real science,  but an a priori rejection of a Designer.  Behe, although not a biblical  creationist, has faced the same sort of academic arrogance, argument from  authority and chronological snobbery faced by defenders of biblical  creation.  It's not surprising when it comes from the most dogmatic  atheists, defending their materialistic faith.  But it's even worse if the  same attacks come from professing evangelicals, but it just goes to show  that they have adopted an essentially materialistic world view  ('methodological naturalism'), and in some cases adopted materialistic  manners as well.<br />However, since science is not Dr Kelly's fort&eacute;, it's to  be expected that there are some inaccuracies.  But these have been pointed  out by creationist scientists themselves!  See the review by Dr Carl  Wieland, CEO of Answers in Genesis, in Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal  12(2):52-54, 1998.  But these inaccuracies don't detract from strong  scientific evidence for creation, which is best found in other books.  And  nor do they affect the exegetically and historically sound case for a plain  understanding of Genesis made by Creation and Change.<br />Edit: many years later, I can say that this book helped to revive interest in the history of interpretation of Genesis.<br />JonathanSarfati,  Ph.D., F.M.Sarfati,  Ph.D., F.M.	1999-03-19
