Sommers' book chronicles America's national, institutionalized, federally funded cold, heartless, systematic crusade against males with data, references, names and institutions.    Sommers opens with data refuting the \\"girl crisis\\" concocted by Harvard's Carol Gilligan and promoted by the AAUW (American Association of University Women) in 1990 based on a survey funded by them of 3000 children. The media jumped to action without considering critiques, conferences multiplied, academics weighed in and soon Congress was passing laws to guard our girls against scholastic underperformance, through some miracle of mental acrobatics making small boys responsible, targeted as the evil container of that Y-chromosome responsible for so much damage. As legal injury multiplied careful reexaminations of statically superior numbers (70,000, 99,000 and 100,000 children from 40 states) showed the opposite - that boys were most at risk, under performing in schools, ignored by teachers, feeling rejected by the system - the AAUW buried it, including their own data supporting these results from a later study. Instead they conference-coached teachers and gender activists: \\"There will always be [those] who will insist the Holocaust didn't happen.\\" And of all the laughs, \\"...revisionists so distort facts [that their] take on history loses all semblance of reality.\\" By this time the U.S. Department Of Education had become the strong-arm and money stream for the AAUW and its team - NOW, the Ms. Foundation, WEEA (Women's Educational Equity Act), the Wesley Center, NCSEE (National Coalition For Sex Equity In Education). Legislation rode the wave and now school boards live under terror of costly lawsuits laying claim to ready abuses of Title IX and the ludicrous notion that small boys are sexual \\"proto-predators\\" to be subjugated. Like the now infamous story of Jonathan Prevette who in 1996 kissed a female classmate, then was punished for sexual harassment. He was six years old. Sommers notes the boy who performed the ultimate outrage of hugging a girl. His parents were told his punishment was due to the fact \\"He's a toucher\\", at age three. In 1997 a Glebe Elementary nine-year-old was cuffed, fingerprinted and charged with aggravated sexual battery for rubbing against a girl when he reached for an apple in the lunch line. Such zealotry is a matter of the weekly news now. And all of it funded with US tax dollars, the DOEd approaching $100M funneled to the AAUW for more nonsense, the teacher's guide \\"Quit It!\\" and whole forests felled for the over 300 different pamphlets, books and working papers on gender equity by the hundreds of thousands crisscrossing the continent, hunting for those dangerous boys one day to be \\"males socialized to destructive masculine ideals\\".     Here's how the laws get changed by a legislature as ignorant of science as Katherine Hanson and her WEEA (funded by the DOEd) when she reported: \\"Every year nearly 4 million women are beaten to death; Violence is the leading cause of death among women; The leading cause of injury among women is being beaten by a man at home; There was a 59% increase in rapes between 1990 and 1991\\". 59%? In one year? As Sommers notes, Hanson's first claim requires 11,000 women beaten to death per day. Wouldn't somebody notice? Not even the Taliban could commit such crimes. The FBI shows 3631 women were murdered in the same year - tragic, but slightly short of 4 million, by a multiplicative factor of 1100. The leading cause of death among women is heart disease (370,000), followed by cancer (250,000). Hanson is right about one thing, rapes did increase, but by 4%, just shy of 59. Perhaps she's refering to Ms. Magazine's study claiming 25% of all college girls as rape victims (even though they didn't know it) or Linda Ledray who tells usthat even undress-you-looks and cat-calls are rapes. Such is the fodder to this day at Ms Magazine's website and others where telling the truth is somehow \\"insensitive to victims\\" (but in fact a threat to the money tree and their ruthless power).    What's happening to boys is played out at our universities under the guise of speech codes (The Shadow University) and Women's Studies where girls are unnecessarily scared senseless of males then learn to despise them as threats (Feminism And Domination), all the while as boys vanish from campus. As the PBS News Hour's Clarence Page said in his essay (March/05), noting the failure of young men in school, at jobs and relationships as young women excel, \\"The problem with we men is we're not women.\\" The problem with Page and his elites is we are not allowing boys to be men, as they are ignored, vilified and grow up ingesting sit-coms and TV commercials that portray males as animals, vulgar, aimless fools with a woman in the background to save them from their monstrosities. The war against boys will give us just what we're getting, disaffected males laden with rage for reasons they can't even articulate. Sommers' book compiles the obvious into a critical mass.	2005-06-27
US	52831327	R1NA6BNR5KD816	1932236422	102609474	Students Guide To American Political Thought (Guides To Major Disciplines)	Books	5	15	18	N	Y	Outstanding	Carey may be peerless in the ample insight he supplies concerning our Founder's intent. This short historical survey of American political thought processes and their conclusions provides a first-rate foundation for the neophyte, or the advanced, pigeonholed in some specific corner of law or politics - quite suitable for the harried American. Though Carey holds a position (and after all what is education if not a search for the right answers?) he is remarkably adept at presenting other sides without torpedoing their thesis. But he doesn't need to, as that is done by carefully reading The Federalist. However, were it not for books like this, revision - conservative or liberal - would have a free hand, putting words in the Founder's mouth, or obfuscating what can be complex Founding issues, not so much through the inertia of these concepts but by their subtleties. Unlike science where erroneous understandings are rejected by nature or refined analysis, these subtleties are what makes the Founding intent a minefield, more open to alteration. Unfortunately, English has not the precision of mathematics, but Carey points us to clarification from the Founders and they're reasonably clear, most often crystal.     Right from the beginning Carey sets the table: \\"On what principles is the government based? How is authority allocated within it? What is its primary purpose? Are there limitations to its powers? How can it be altered? On what assumptions about human nature is it based?\\" Past civilizations were \\"ordained by the gods\\" or \\"given by a mythical lawgiver,\\" but America's Founding was a reasoned struggle, not only at the Convention but over decades of debate and State testing, resulting in the \\"will of the people,\\" not a god. The Federalist as defense of the proposed Constitution addressed these matters. It is, though, a \\"nuts and bolts\\" approach, writes Carey, not an extensive theoretical or philosophical treatise - practical vs. idealistic. And this is where much political thought separates from The Federalist, attempting to redraft its meaning to satisfy \\"the way things ought to be\\" regardless of what works. An example follows fifty years after our most lethal war with resulting elevation of the Lincoln era, retroactively recasting the Constitution in light of our Declaration through Lincoln's moving speeches, making rights and equality paramount. For such interpretations, writes Carey \\"...democracy is primarily government `for the people' not necessarily `by the people',\\" bearing \\"a close relationship to those [ideals] that inspired the French Revolution.\\" The Constitution is then judged by how well it lives up to The Declaration. But Carey argues it does live up to central themes expressed there and is a continuation of the same political thought - once again by reference to The Federalist - just not the way revisionists want it to be.     Reading the Constitution cold is likely to leave one under-whelmed, but Carey transforms it. Like lifeless mathematical equations as abstract markings on paper, grasping their meaning and implications converts them to revelation, lifting them from the page to fly. Carey does this for the Founding, through him our Founders nearly live again. But based on our mutilation of their intent they'd probably rather be dead.	2005-06-18
US	52831327	R3OZ1E3GWDH6XP	0865971382	573581602	In Defense of the Constitution	Books	5	19	22	N	Y	Shocking, repellant, more anxiety than a Hollywood thriller	Carey's voice is a squeak in the deafening redefining din of America's Founding, but a voice desperately needed concerning one of the half-dozen most lethal threats to the United States. To those of us in fields that make sense with nature as the final judge, it's beyond comprehension and utterly embarrassing that such intellectual train wrecks could even happen among members of our own species, intentionally, and initiated by what we term the \\"well educated\\". This book blew me off my chair as page after page Carey pealed back seemingly harmless, subtle, minor changes in Constitutional interpretation, readings of The Federalist, and reverse casting of what Madison, Hamilton and the others stated ever so clearly in English. We find Constitutional \\"progressives\\", decades before Postmodernism, could state whatever they liked regardless of fallacy, from which to stage their attack on the Constitution, Founders, and basis of intelligent governance, sharpening their \\"higher values\\", with the power to accumulate enough internal damage to eventually tumble this Republic.      Early salvos were fired from selectively excerpting The Federalist, delivering the message that Publius was a battleground between Madison and Hamilton, when a full reading of The Federalist shows both clearly agreeing with the other. If even The Federalist harbored disagreements over the Constitution (which it didn't) then we may make anything we like of their resulting document. Carey makes it clear there were disagreements after ratification, notably between Hamilton and Madison over the national bank, for which a number of reasons are offered - e.g. that Madison was playing politics for personal gain. Carey also notes state-centric Anti-Federalists in opposition to a more national view proposed by Federalists. And on a variety of matters the Founders intentionally left only structure and process, through which prudence and good sense could arrive at reasoned decisions - a structure now nearly dismantled. But to claim there should be no controversy would be to cast human nature and valid critical thinking as something it can never be for divisive agendas.     Of greatest gravity to Carey is our Supreme Court's usurpation of power in violation of the Founder's intent, expectation and express definition by Hamilton. Anti-Federalists warned, \\"From this court there is no appeal\\" (but by amendment), so they pushed for a Bill Of Rights to \\"limit government\\", as did Jefferson, who later convinced Madison (which he had the power of personality to do). Hamilton argued against such a Bill because a definition of rights abrogates those not defined; definitions free from evasion are impossible; and contrary to intent such definitions expand a roll for enforcement, i.e. by the National government, precisely an entity they desired to curb. Informed by their knowledge of Rome, Federalists felt the danger was Congress, not the Court, thus they divided it. Ironically, what the Bill Of Rights created - pressed for by Anti-Federalists - was the Court they warned against following interpretations of \\"due process\\" from the 1868 Fourteenth Amendment eighty years later, which, ironically, concludes that Congress shall be the protector of individual rights. Thus the Court now legislates outside government by the people by not only saying \\"No\\" to what have become their subordinates, the States, but \\"No, and here's what you do to fix it.\\" Thus as Carey argues, creating a tension between the Court's intrusion upon States and public consensus, a consensus Madison intended in his mixed system of National and State sovereignty.     Carey closes with an attack on Court abuse and our acquiescence to it, targeting the sensitive subject of abortion as one among many examples. Carey's point is to show Court overextension - which, he claims, the Court admits to - through the operation of a national minority taking control through the apparatus of a sympathetic Court in opposition to the people'swill. However, he does reveal his position on abortion, stating that without reversal by Congress, \\"nothing will save us from our moral degeneration\\". Contrary to postmodern readings, Carey's admission does not by default make his abuse argument incorrect, though in American society such opinions are expected to be hidden to avoid easy dismissal. Carey goes on to say the \\"very nature of the issue involved must preclude even one state permitting abortion on demand\\", but it's unclear what nature precludes State sovereignty to determine their own laws outside national matters like war. (Though not equated with the innocent unborn - states still determine whether to carry out executions or not without national sanction.) Carey blames \\"secular scientific humanism\\" and natural rights philosophy as root. But humanism - professing that humans in and of themselves can find truth and goodness (i.e. without reference to God) gave way to Reformation, Hobbs, Locke and the notion our Founders should even attempt what they finally did. As Locke noted, the state exists not to promote people's spiritual salvation, but to serve its citizens and to guarantee their life, liberty, and property under a constitution. Carey appears to take issue with a lack of higher morality within the State - a valid concern for societies commandeered by Postmodern relativism and their kin in Constitutional revision. However, his target seems more appropriately directed at \\"positive liberalism\\", an extension beyond humanism with an autocratic sense of engaging the state for its \\"new morality\\" under the guise of assisting the individual. Carey does bring to fore inadequacies of our social models, abstracted (like scientific models of nature) in ways necessarily approximate to what we really are.     A stellar text. Prepare for sleepless nights, because if Carey is right (and all one need do is survey the modern Court and attitudes towards it), the American Republic is in Trouble. Raising the question ofwhether history may eventually repeat itself with a dictator as solution to tyranny of another sort.	2005-06-12

And how - without assistance by unnatural applications of reason and science - we're precisely the same if allowed to be. It raises questions of how we can possibly save our natural world and truly believe in a spiritual reality if we and the natural world are subjected to modern thinking found to be so successful. <br />Focusing on Sumer and Egypt we find the ancients didn't separate man from nature. Man was part of society embedded in nature, dependent on cosmic forces. Long before Old Testament declarations of conquest over nature, man was not in opposition. They obviously struggled \\"against\\" a \\"hostile\\" environment, but this account is our language describing their situation, not their state of mind. Reminiscent of Campbell's clarification between modern and ancient perspectives as \\"it\\" vs. \\"thou\\", our authors describe this difference as \\"subject\\" vs. \\"object\\". The ancients had one mode of expression, thought, speech - the personal. Everything had a will and personality revealing itself. They could reason logically but such intellectual detachment was hardly compatible with their experience of reality. Impersonal laws did not satisfy their understanding. When the river doesn't rise, it's not due to lack of rain - the river refused to rise. You'd not hurt yourself in a fall - the ground chose to hurt you, or not. Their view was qualitative and concrete, not quantitative and abstract.  <br /> <br />In science we apply a procedure, progressively reducing phenomena until subjected to universal laws. We \\"de-complicate\\" systems to understand them. There's a hierarchy of complexity making planetary motions simpler systems than say, living cells, thus more or less complete theories of each, but we've proven since Galileo initiated modern science that we're so close to the truth of nature (the judge of our understanding) that our theories can earn our acceptancethrough success of their predictions and utility. We really did build Voyager to that understanding and it really did what we thought it would when released to nature's command - three billion miles from earth, still obeying our grasp of nature. Furthermore, accurate theories are able to predict things never dreamed possible when created. Relativity still yields such surprises. We see phenomena as manifestations of general laws, not by what makes them peculiar.  <br /> <br />The ancient mind is termed \\"mythopoetic\\". Their perspective is why scriptures were written when they were and not anymore - writings imbibed with mystery and inflation of life one assumes we've lost to critical reason and economic forces. But the mythopoetic mind is still here, the natural mind we are born with. It's why we have palm readers, cults, astrologers, ghosts, UFOs, Creationists, pet psychics, TV conversations with the dead, best selling books on how to \\"know\\" God and beliefs that flying jets into buildings will send their pilots to heaven. All expanding lives otherwise sterilized by 9-to-5, traffic jams, ignorance, poverty. In Mexico women are advised to remain inside during a solar eclipse, least they become spontaneously pregnant. As my Aunt said of Columbia, \\"If God wanted us to be in space he'd given us wings.\\" If God wanted us to drive cars he'd given us wheels, or to live under roofs, he'd have put shingles on our head. What some battle as absurd is also quite natural, dangerous and capable of elevating life, avoiding deconstruction and reductionism applied to humans made of more than carbon and water. A dilemma revealed by this book. And if Tattersall is correct, this behavior may have a lot to do with our messy brain structure, a condition we're stuck with.	2005-05-28

Alley created an excellent Scientific American article (\\"Abrupt Climate Change\\", November 2004, available online) in terms of information and engaging writing style. His \\"Time Machine\\", though occasionally informative, reads like a slow elementary-school or sagacious politician's overview. \\"Many clever people are studying things in ice, and learning many things.\\" Yawn. Maybe this was his intent, though nowhere are we forewarned. He's best when reporting his personal adventures in the ice core data recovery field he's part of. A crucial hinge in the unfolding \\"climate change\\" arena - what we used to call \\"global warning\\" until PR firms (minions of political parties and conglomerates, generously applying political correctness) changed the name to sound less ominous. This book is not about the most recent GRIP, Greenland Ice Core Project, cataloging 123,000 years of earth's atmospheric history in that region (and some 2 million year old plants to boot). It does reveal findings of a previous drilling - good for 110 millennia - and the Vostok ice core, extending back about 450,000 years. (Take that Creationists.)  <br /> <br />These cores read like pages in a book, one year's ice layer piled atop another, trapping gases, dust and aerosols in each. According to Alley (repeated by Brian Fagan) the good news is, compared to previous interglacial warming periods, we humans have been remarkably lucky during the Holocene, the last 12,000 years (since the invention of agriculture), with relatively stable climate, except for a few major hiccups. The bad news is plural. Contrary to opinions, measurable, repeatable data shows we have among the highest concentrations of CO2 in these recorded histories; The thermohaline circulation (the ocean's equator-to-pole hot/cold exchange system) is a smoking gun in massive change (which according to NOAA data is shutting down via ice melt freshening); And the biggest news of all - ice cores show dramatic, even catastrophic climate shift, as Alley writes, \\"in less time than it takes it get a college degree\\". Oops. Apparently nature has a threshold. Once tripped, it's a long ride back - about a hundred thousand years. Such audacity nature has to act in a nonlinear fashion is inexcusable. <br /> <br />But nature and man are not without their ironies. While politicians, conglomerates and talk show hosts paint their rosy picture of longer summers on the beach (ignoring these beaches may be under water) or flourishing plant life in CO2-rich atmospheres (ignoring they may be fried in heat and dryness), as it turns out ice ages are triggered by warming. Standby. Exciting times coming, except nobody knows when. The Pentagon considers global warming a national security risk (at least enough to fund a study) - though to what generation?  We'll keep rolling the dice, but at least Alley is trying to sound the alarm. Unfortunately, to the world's biggest offender, we heard all this in the Sixties, then tried to change the world by collecting litter on Earth Day - that's been a thousand fads ago. Nobody's listening.	2005-05-21

Nowhere else is such clarity apparent in the complex field of radars. Thanks to Stimson this subject could be understood by my grandmother. If only Stimson would carry edition three to the next echelon, extending depth and detail to levels required to actually build and make a working, modern radar. Like applying his talent to the intricacies of adaptive processing, a completion of SAR computational demands and processes (vs. stopping at the digital filter FFT), nuances of ever more important phase noise, test, measurement and producibility of radar systems that shouldn't cost a million dollars per copy, but a fraction of this with proper processes and synergistic integration vs. the \\"Mister Potato Head\\" approach of slapping together the latest-greatest-of-every-subsystem-technology still practiced by engineers in just about everything. Unfortunately this may be our last version from Stimson as he's no longer a young man and such efforts are monumental.

Having been given the gift of his existence we are magnificently lucky he wrote what he knew so we might scratch the surface. Once again Bloom inspires by penetrating our perpetual present with the permanent and universal. This time he performs this magic through analysis of Shakespeare's plays, their political message, Shakespeare's grasp of what makes us who we are and the great, forever present teacher he has the capacity to serve as, if, at least for the moment, we ignore \\"new critic\\" sermons. (He means postmodern sophistry.) What makes Bloom so uplifting is his success in communicating power to the reader. With Bloom's assistance, not control, the reader realizes we too hold the keys to our richest experiences, unavailable to those attached to fashionable dogmas, Right or Left.<br /><br />Shakespeare's plays deal with fragile balances of humanity as individuals and as associations (civilization) with their impossible reconciliations between competing concepts and ideals, which is what both are made of. The Jew and Christian in Venice - their conflicts between what matters most while still members of the same society, which though peaceful and prosperous engages in the simplification of man; The strength and weakness of men in love, with women and their own self image; the root of tragedy suffered by the hero precisely due to his heroic strengths. Shakespeare acts on so many levels it's hard to fathom anyone could grasp it all without Bloom as escort.<br /><br />Bloom has a habit of telling the truth about our circumstances and for that he is sure to be character assassinated by those unable to deal with it. We do not, he says, \\"look at all to books when [we] meet problems in life or think about [our] goals; there are no literary models for [our] conceptions of virtue and vise.\\" Reflecting a deeper fact about \\"the decay of common understanding of - and agreement on - first principles that is characteristic of our times.\\" Resulting in a \\"decided lowering of tone in [our] reflections on life and its goals.\\" Thus we are \\"technically well equipped but Philistine.\\" But Shakespeare provides an opportunity to see out of this, as do other great books Bloom was so taken by and wrote about elsewhere.ent on - first principles that is characteristic of our times.\\" Resulting in a \\"decided lowering of tone in [our] reflections on life and its goals.\\" Thus we are \\"technically well equipped but Philistine.\\" But Shakespeare provides an opportunity to see out of this, as do other great books Bloom was so taken by and wrote about elsewhere.	2005-03-27

Paine is direct, factual and relentless. Even in this short book his condemnation of scriptural religion becomes tedious in his effort to be complete. To Paine, scriptural religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam - are the study of \\"opinions and fancies of men\\" confusing the message of God, which he says, is to be found in nature, available to all, unhindered by translations, rewritings and Church censorship.<br /><br />His knowledge of ancient mythologies and understanding of how the early Church evolved as a direct overlay of the Roman Empire with assumption of the Roman pantheon as Saints of the Church is impressive for 1794. He precedes our modern day Dominic Crossan by 200 years when he reports there was nothing new in virgin births or miracles in the ancient world - a common occurrence. To believe such events as resurrection from the dead Paine finds no different from any other superstition. To Paine Jesus was a heroic figure, peerless among men, but a man all the same, made into a God by those who loved him.<br /><br />Part 1 is concerned with the unreasonable like prophesy, which he shows to be hindsight not prediction. Likewise, Biblical moral conflicts of human sacrifice: \\"If I owe a person money and cannot pay him\\", writes Paine, someone else could assume the debt for payment, averting debtor's prison. But \\"if I commit a crime... moral justice cannot take the innocent for the guilty, even if the innocent would offer itself.\\" Part 2 is concerned with inconsistencies or impossibilities in the Bible itself. Like Moses writing of his own death, or the city of Dan which did not exist until 331 years after the Bible says Moses died; God's promise to save king Ahaz from Assyrians in Isaiah, while God slaughters him with Assyrians in Chronicles. The list is long, suitable for critiques, but tiring. Paine can also be amusing. Reviewing the Garden he notes the snake \\"enters into familiar conversation with Eve, who is in no way surprised to hear a snake talk.\\" With these complications, and a list of reason violations, Paine writes that scriptures are \\"atheistic blasphemy.\\" If you want to know God, he says, learn science as it is the true theology, revealing God all around us.<br /><br />Reading scriptures literally, as we do today, Paine reveals the obvious. But if Joseph Campbell's mythological tips are accessed we can see more to the stories than simply God's murder of innocent first born or his too-human characteristics of jealousy and revenge. Though it may be hard to see past the carnage of scriptures there remains a mystical element, like art, communicating past the painful present, penetrating the mystery of being alive and having to die, written by people without our clutter and with time to think about such things.ine can also be amusing.

Data from a variety of sources, not available until now, correlates with history the impacts of climate on civilization. Fagan opens with a curious personal experience - his small sailboat on treacherous Spanish waters, passed by cargo-laden hulks seemingly oblivious to nature's furry. This introduction becomes a wonderful analogy for the \\"scale of our vulnerability\\". As we complicate society and \\"tame\\" nature we also massively increase the calamity of nature's accumulating response. The Sumerian city of Ur becomes our first tour and what a tour it is. Fagan hits his stride, crystallizing his point when Sumerians are his centerpiece. Conceived around 6000 BCE as a collection of villages already employing canals for irrigation, the region suffered a monsoon shift driving Sumerians to increase organization through innovation. Hence, invention of the city by 3100 BCE. Volcanic induced climate shift eventually ran the Sumerian ship aground, as similar shifts did for others, not only starving the populous but dissolving faith in their gods, kings and way of life. But, Fagan writes, \\"The intricate equation between urban population, readily accessible food supplies and the economic, political and social flexibility sufficient to roll with the climatic punches has been irrevocably altered.\\" \\"If Ur was a small trading ship, industrial civilization is a supertanker.\\" And supertankers split in half now and then. The ability to simply return to farming or hunter gathering is now lost given that so many of us occupy the landscape, competing with everyone else under the same conditions. If some of us once comforted ourselves with notions of shinning up the hunting rifle, returning to nature in our tent during such a calamity - forget it.  When societies - stretched to the limit - falter under climate change, stress in the psyche comes to the fore in ways never imagined, even (or especially) in abrasive group-oriented societies like ours. Tribal suspicions lie waiting for such opportunities.  <br /> <br />Making light of Postmodernists without trying to, Fagan notes the same human response by cultures separated by thousands of years, different continents, \\"meaning and value\\" systems; \\"In both the Old World and the New, human societies reacted to climate traumas with social and political changes that are startling in their similarities.\\" Universal human truths after all.   <br /> <br />\\"But if we've become a supertanker among human societies, it's an oddly inattentive one. Only a tiny fraction of people on board are engaged with tending the engines. The rest are buying and selling goods among themselves, entertaining each other... Those on the bridge have no charts or weather forecasts and cannot even agree that they are needed; indeed, the most powerful among us subscribe to a theory that says storms don't exist... And no one dares to whisper in the helmsman's ear that he might consider turning the wheel.\\" So ends a well written, at times spellbinding account of our past and warning to our present, ignored at our own peril.	2005-02-20

Their word choice, what they choose to cover and ignore, highlight and dismiss, has always been transparent for anyone who thinks for more than two seconds about what they say and why.

It's personal, at times coarse, abrasive and loaded with too much cursing which all serve to give the elites a means of dismissing Goldberg as an angry crank. Contrary to Foucault's disciples, even if he were, that does not make what he claims to be false. Of course the media would engage in character assassination, lies and obfuscation, but Goldberg makes it too easy for them. However, this text is not about limp attacks by Marvin Kalb, Rather and others since the book, but since he wrote a Wall Street Journal piece admiring the King's clothes. For that Goldberg is treated by these reporters anxious for a scoop like a leper, and worse, like an atheistic communist in a McCarthy court. He names names and quotes them: Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw, Andrew Heyword (who admits, \\"Look Bernie, of course there's a liberal bias in the news. All the networks tilt left.\\"), The New York Times (what a surprise) and the initiator of it all by his flagrantly biased coverage of Steve Forbes, Eric Engberg.     The secret that's not a secret except in New York is out. As one of many supporters outside the halls of our media mafia wrote to Goldberg, \\"Liberal bias among television networks has done something market forces could not have engendered, the revitalization of radio.\\" Which once had only NPR's liberal bias. Now dogma of the Right has a voice too. The Left did this as an unknowing favor for the Right. All Goldberg does is embarrass the machine for inefficient brain washing of its troops, then letting them bury themselves.	2004-11-01

Berkley's Feyerabend, MIT's Kuhn, U of London's Popper and Lakatos take a whipping so stinging, their institutions of \\"higher learning\\" should be smoldering (and ashamed) for the length of their existence.<br /><br />Chapter 1 reveals their overused technique of quoting success-words like \\"knowledge,\\" \\"truth,\\" \\"proof,\\" implying the opposite of what these words mean just as done above with \\"higher learning.\\" Chapter 2 is so dry it reads like a math text but does give examples of word games played. Reminiscent of art historians trying to explain art by telling us who the artists were, Stove reveals postmodern philosophers and sociologists expressing a similar inability to separate what science is from what scientists do. Appendices following chapter 1 & 2 summarize how funny and farcical postmodernism (\\"cultural studies\\" or whatever they call themselves this afternoon) really is.<br /><br />So ends the first two, occasionally laborious chapters with chapter 3 (and little of the text is a cruise), showing us not how irrationalists ply their trade but how such silliness got started and why its sustained. In a riveting passage we find Einstein doing psychological damage to Newton (as far as the public and philosophers are concerned) and what was believed to be his concrete truths. (With no mention of non-intuitive quantum mechanics around the same time.) There seems some embarrassment from the philosophers of science with an enduring determination not to be bitten by certainty again, adopting the easy and now popular method of avoiding certainty rather than striving to be correct. Thus Hume, forgotten for 150 years, is resurrected to service in the 20th century for a movement \\"of retreat from confidence in science which was so high, and constantly rising, in the two preceding centuries,\\" writes Stove. Oddly, Stove fails to note overreaction to Einstein by the like Kuhn who claim one theory completely replaces another. Newton has been never more than today by every aircraft, missile, satellite, automobile and tricycle maker in the world. Apparently Newton is doing just fine on earth, though he has a perilous time near stars, black holes and quasars.<br /><br />If, as postmoderns promote, there is no accumulation of knowledge and generalizations of specifics through inductive reasoning are wrong, Stove's reader is allowed simpler questions outside labyrinthine logic arguments. e.g. Given these postmodern rules, has the knowledge of say, driving a car, always been known to humanity - since Homo erectus perhaps? Or was it later acquired adding to our overall knowledge? Each time Feyerabend bought a new car, assuming he did, did he have to learn to drive all over again, since experience of one specific case cannot be generalized to other cases? Or maybe, as Stove notes, Feyerabend didn't drive, but simply turned himself into a bird. As to Feyerabend that is just as likely and as reasonable to believe as our ability to justifiably and accurately apply induction. Stoves example that \\"all fires are hot\\" further clarifies the obvious. Postmodern designs try desperately to convince us that we can never know if fires \\"will be hot,\\" or if fires we never saw or experienced were hot. Despite clear violations of physics - which philosophers don't grasp - this kind of mental acrobatics is what makes the whole movement so inane, and incomprehensibly dominant in academia. But if we remember it doesn't have to make reasoned sense to serve political extremes - discounting all certainty and Western-style knowledge for insertion of other preferences - then what Stove has done is reveal the transparent nature of the Emperors elaborate clothes.nstein by the like Kuhn who claim one theory completely replaces another.

He notes that at Berkeley the white student population declined from 68% in 1974 to 37% in 1994 while 75% of America was white at that time. Assuming all is equal, which of course it isn't, one would expect equal representation by demographic percentage. The obvious question is, if America were 75% white in 1994, why would only 37% be admitted to Berkeley? Could whites be disadvantaged, incapable of passing Berkeley's rigorous standards, or because Berkeley practices racist admission policies? Levine writes this \\"is more representative of the nation's population,\\" but as it fails numerically the reader is left to wonder in what way it is more representative? He adds that Berkeley became the first major university with a majority of minority students, revealing early his emphasis on race, not education, and his philosophy, as expanded on by Arthur M. Schlesinger's \\"Disuniting Of America.\\"    Levine's book is a response to Alan Bloom's critique of modern American university education in \\"The Closing Of The American Mind.\\" Bloom is at times recklessly and conveniently misrepresented while at others accurate enough to cause wonder at what Levine could possibly disagree with? Levine paints Bloom as anti-multiculturalist. However, as Bloom notes, Herodotus was a multiculturalist too, as all should be, but with a different intent than now practiced in America: to learn what was unknown about the human condition, not to return from his travels to dismantle his homeland by removing Greek (Western) thinking as a \\"bias\\" suppressive of others, which is Levine's position repeated throughout the book, generally between the lines.     Levine characterizes criticism of our university system and its politics as \\"conservative\\" because, in Derridian form, he focuses on who said it, not what they say or if it might be true. No debate. Yet Levine swears by open-mindedness - as long as it does not clash with his agenda. Using out-of-context sound bites Levine relishes remarks by his critics as crazy eyed, apocalyptic non-sense, lumping all into the same bucket. Never is there a hearing on recorded events and practice on campus from which these criticisms are sourced. Levine marginalizes opposition by the oft-used method of obfuscation. Issues are just too complicated, vast, impenetrable, given such mixture, morphing attitudes or flux of opinions in the marketplace of ideas to make a conclusion. That \\"conclusion\\" is happy news for Levine as it is self-serving, keeping his dogma in power. Practicing a Creationist favorite, Levine puts words in the mouth of his critic's then tells how wrong they are. \\"It surely was much simpler when the university community was a homogeneous one,\\" writes Levine. A statement critics would agree with, but not condone, nor dare make against the muscle of today's climate of political correctness.     Levine smacks of the anti-West creed throughout, dismissing with a sneer those who could possibly claim Western ideals as \\"good.\\" As though only naïve fools would utter such \\"myth\\" and \\"propaganda.\\" Levine's book is readable, though not the penetrating and elevating work Bloom offered. Levine does reveal what his side of our politicized universities stand for and against, and in that his text has value as a measure of how bad things are.work Bloom offered.

Sagan finds the fellow curious, interested in man and his universe but full of media distributed pseudoscience with exciting news of \\"excessively genial\\" aliens flying about earth in their UFOs, poltergeists, crystal powers and astrology - i.e. sexy flash that sells. With common man so full of crop circles and mental telepathy, Sagan is sad to discover the more amazing facts of science entirely absent, or so twisted out of shape that their sound bite representations are something else all together. We want so much to be roused from our \\"humdrum lives, to rekindle that sense of wonder we remember from childhood,\\" he says. We crave hard evidence, scientific proof and its \\"seal of approval but are unwilling to put up with the rigorous standards of evidence that impart credibility to that seal.\\"<br /><br />The values of science, he claims, and that of democracy are nearly indistinguishable in that both require free exchange of ideas, debate and reason with standards of evidence and honesty. Which should be no great wonder, given America's Founders and their antecedents like Locke (a chemist) were scientists, including Jefferson. Sagan asks how a nation can maintain democracy when the source of that kind of thinking is lost with the loss of critical sagacity among its population?<br /><br />Sagan does not spare the opposite end of our educated spectrum, targeting postmodern philosophers who dismiss science as mythical and irrational; a Western bias with no relation to truth about nature. What these people seem never able to grasp is that science is both refutable (unlike religious claims) and testable against nature itself as the final judge. The predictions of quantum mechanics, Relativity theory or Newtonian gravitation can be verified by how semiconductors work, lasers, masers, orbiting galaxies, exploding stars and gravity waves. Because Newton, Einstein, Descartes or any other scientist held biases, bigotry, racist, sexist or unsavory political views is irrelevant to the accuracy of their scientific theories. We may not like them as people, but we successfully use their theories every day. Postmodern practice of dismissing their science because we don't like the scientist's politics is a recent and backward view incapable of separating politics from anything else. Atoms behave as atoms, and can be observed to do so whether one is Liberal or Conservative and 1 + 1 is still 2 whether one is religious or not. Saying it isn't because one doesn't like Bertrand Russell's proof of it as he was an atheist, or the racism of those who discovered how atoms behave does little more than expand ignorance and confirm membership of postmoderns to 95% of those scientifically illiterate.<br /><br />Though frightening, Sagan is honest and wonderful. Realization is the first step. Thank you, Carl.	2004-07-24

His writing is insightful, flows with ease and engages the reader with mini-revelations. Though he writes only the first chapter, a few others are equally enthralling, especially those on Pope John Paul II's philosophy and that concerning Islam. Unfortunately a few others belong only to sociologists - lists, speculation and esoteric social theories, which often sound as though from an ivory tower on another planet, where social theorists debate whether their world is made all of one thing or all of another. In the John Paul chapter we find the Pope concretely defeating postmodern silliness in its rejection of universality. The chapter on Islam teaches much and provides reasoned, balanced direction toward Islamic change for the better, though some of that is perhaps a bit idyllic when it comes to fundamentalist Islam as one may as well preach peace to a charging grizzly. <br />Berger's premise is this: To assume we are living in a secular world is wrong. The world today &quot;is as furiously religious as it ever was, and in some places more than ever&quot;. Though modernity has secularizing effects it has provoked powerful movements of counter-secularization. Which harkens back to the Brooks Adams 1896 classic, &quot;The Law Of Civilization And Decay&quot;. In it Adams notes with no one left to defeat, ideas from round the Empire flooded Rome causing a near universal dis-ease among its population. Their response? Extreme religious eagerness, the sprouting of new mystery religions of which Christianity was but one of hundreds. Our upsurge today is primarily among conservative, traditionalist orthodox movements of Islam and in the Christian world among Pentecostals and other Evangelicals at the expense of Catholicism and mainline Protestantism like Lutheran, Episcopalian and Methodists. <br />Why has modernity had this affect? Berger is clear, because modernity has removed all the old certainties and most people find it impossible to live with uncertainty. Any movement that &quot;promises to provide or renew certainty has a ready market&quot;. Those &quot;dripping with supernaturalism have widely succeeded&quot;.<br />Berger does not note the 60's source of modern Liberal promoters of their paradox that &quot;the truth is there is no truth&quot;, but he does say while thin on the ground in numbers they wield excess influence by their control of the media and university (of which he is a member - Boston U). This is the &quot;culture elite&quot; Berger notes that some fraction of the movements resent and battle in America's Culture Wars - and not necessarily for religious reasons. Without mention of lacking higher education among the masses, Berger clarifies the chasm between secular (of comparatively what little there is) and non-secular, &quot;The religious impulse, the quest for meaning that transcends the restricted space of empirical existence in this world, has been a perennial feature of humanity. It would require something close to a mutation of the species to extinguish this impulse for good... The critique of secularity common to all the resurgent movements is that human existence bereft of transcendence is an impoverished and finally untenable condition.&quot; Like it or not religion, mysticism, mythology have been and will remain part of humans. Finding a path to balance in the face of warring zealotry - which was of such concern to The Founders - is a subject of concern in this extraordinary book.	2004-07-07

Less is there a distinction between history and fiction in this, one of many fronts in the culture wars against Western Civilization. In this book we find a war of atrocities committed by the West upon itself, most notably in the US. The Australian author, Keith Windshuttle, carries us through the wreckage to find objectivity has been abandoned, truth hopelessly politicized. But no vacuum remains. The old objectivity is replaced by kind sounding censorship, control, and quiet vendetta. This is not isolated but permeates the West's political system, media and every university that once considered education its aim. Not a conspiracy but a movement. The attack is not only on history but on knowledge. Even science fabricates its understandings of nature to serve political bias. (Fortunately, nature is the final judge, and technology conforms to that nature - i.e. technology works.)    One such \\"new Left\\" theory discussed by Windshuttle is \\"structuralism\\" (pioneered by Claude Lévi-Strauss), claiming that people are incapable of seeing outside structures imposed by their culture - a psychological edifice confining every thought to this structure. But structuralism cannot account for insights radically outside accepted modes of thought that are the mainstay of scientific and social revolutions - Einstein and Jesus. According to Windshuttle, the new movements tell us we can never really know what happened in history, then contradict themselves by telling us what really happened. Far from defeating Eurocentric bias, we find structuralists extending it. University professors rename their personal political agendas as \\"cultural studies\\" in order to brainwash students their way under rules of \\"academic freedom.\\" We find revisionist history, segregation of students by race or gender with White Studies or Women's Studies on campus (what the Klan wanted but failed at), and the blending of fact with fiction to insert a totalitarian indoctrination little different than fundamentalist conservatives who seek to rewrite text books because the facts of life are unsettling. Not just another transient social fad, these new movements are a crisis of civilization for Windshuttle.     Oswald Spengler said this would happen: the West would begin to doubt itself, find itself guilty, and pronounce a verdict of its own extinction. Windshuttle indicates we've arrived. An excellent book by a man immersed in the field. If you read this book you'll find it hard to put down, but you may never sleep soundly again.	2004-05-27

Many still consider the Gnostic Gospels heresy - derided as such 2000 years ago, suppressed, lost and rediscovered in 1945 outside Nag Hammadi, Egypt. One of those gospels, the Gospel Of Thomas, is Pagels emphasis. Scholars have dated Thomas to the same time frame as John, the latest (youngest) of the four Gospels. With Mark as the oldest surviving gospel (after an undiscovered Q Gospel) Pagels reveals an astonishing expansion of the concept of Jesus from man to God over time. We find much of John a rebuttal of Thomas and his rival school of thought. The central message of Thomas is that Jesus claims the kingdom of the Father is upon the land and men do not see it, that each has God within them, they only need discover it for themselves and see the world in a new way conveyed by Jesus. John, however, rails against this perspective by making clear that only Jesus has \\"the light\\", no one else, it is only through Jesus one finds salvation and the kingdom won't be here until Armageddon. The Thomas Jesus is cryptic, demanding self-examination. Johns Jesus is easy, concrete and requires only belief in His divine nature. It is also from John we receive the gift of damnation for all non-Christians. Such claims made John (the Johnian school or whoever wrote John) appear in his day as a radical Jewish sect and apparently he/they were persecuted for it as John includes them in his list of rivals.     That John rebukes Thomas is clear through his differences with Mark, Mathew and Luke. Only in John, when Jesus reappears designating his disciples to carry forth, is Thomas not among them. Only in John is Thomas the doubter and does he receive a reprimand from Jesus. It is also in John that Jesus has a \\"beloved disciple\\" never named and superior to Peter. Does John want to claim the beloved is John, but find it politically expedient to only imply it?    Pagels book is a revelation itself in which Thomas shows us a genius in Jesus not seen in the other gospels. Given the political nature of John and their timing one fears the same error in Thomas - was he responding to John, inventing words for Jesus for political/philosophical gain?     Thomas lost the contest to John, of course, through suppression by the Church, and one might wonder if not from the easy grasp of and more supernatural Jesus he presents. At least he won in the first 2000 years. Perhaps someone will print a complete Bible with gospels of Thomas, Mary and the rest (becoming known as extracanonical gospels) such that a clearer picture of Jesus can be given in the next 2000 years, and thanks to efforts by those like Pagels who truly practice what Jesus preached, to seek the truth and set us free.	2004-05-02

We find the root of new movement adoptions of multiculturalism (a veil for rejecting the West), elimination of standards (because they clarify difference) and diversity as the central function of a university. <br />French philosophers of the sixties were a secondary inquisition begun by German philosophers, adopted by the French because they served a purpose to prosecute the West for what it created or could not stop in the carnage of two world wars. The advent of Enlightenment reason did not halt history's slaughter, so reason was to be thrown out, with nothing, however, to replace it. <br />Like ancient religious sects who were not allowed to write the name of their god in an effort to complicate and externalize god, so too for Derrida, Foucault and their gang, maintaining as the authors note, \\"a cult of paradox and the insistent demand for complexity... for a rejection of clarity\\". Complicating what would otherwise be simple, \\"accustoming their readers and listeners to the belief that incomprehensibility is a sign of greatness and that the thinkers silence before incongruous demands for meaning was not proof of weakness but indication of endurance in the presence of the Unsayable\\".  Follow, don't ask questions. The reason for complexity is of course to maintain, like legalese, their power and influence as a free ride.<br />We find Foucault making use of Nietzsche's notion that \\"there are no facts, only interpretation\\" - leading to the modern day paradox that \\"the truth is there is no truth and that's truth\\". One assumes this applies to those who preach it. Such sweeping generalizations and mutilations of reason (which they reject as Western bias) are then extrapolated to embrace all of society - never addressing that history leaves real artifacts and that science, for example, produces testable, verifiable facts, regardless of political agendas. Foucault also applies Nietzsche's notion that it is not what someone says or writes that matters but who says it. Hence what one does not say or write is what matters most (leading to an infinity of speculation). <br />Most ironically a discovery of self in the 60's transformed into a \\"cult of me\\". A hedonistic movement carrying student protestors concerned for justice and environment to narcissistic aroma therapy, acupuncture and Yuppie mass capitalistic consumption so much more materialistic than the administration they opposed with no plan for replacement, only an abandonment of old ways, as though removal would solve anything. A demand for identity, an affirmation of the right to be different and struggling against constraints on individual existence led the participants to believe they were liberating individuality while they merely accelerated homogenization through mercantilism once rallied against as they now busily save for retirement. This postmodern movement \\"Having exhausted the possibilities for renewing the contents [of modernism], [adopted] the principle of renewal itself, as an end in itself, of endlessly generating the absolutely new. In this way it became embedded in a contradiction that could not be overcome since in time the production of newness itself appeared to lack newness\\" simply \\"democratizing hedonist logic\\". A \\"revolution with no outcome, no program, no political framework... the first indifferent revolution\\". Add to this elucidation of Foucault's  abject errors and we see how even the initial premise falls flat. Which has not stopped the expansion of this philosophy. The negative aftermath of such mental acrobatics has been profound and widely embraced by the West where now self-mastery is viewed as a threat to those who have none. Having lost the desire for self-mastery we \\"no longer tend to regard other people as other subjects, as other willed consciousness with whom relations can take the form of a reciprocal recognition of freedoms\\". Such are benefits of the sixties.	2004-04-20

As feminist theory is an area of study not science, its authors make claims which by making them alone suffice to make them true. Bartky engages in so many suppositions as though they were critically derived conclusions, the reader finds dismissal hard to avoid. For example, Bartky submits without substantiation that all humans are born bisexual. And her support of this claim? Not given. Bartky’s supposition flies in the face of biology and common sense but it does expose her underlying support of social constructivism: the idea all is nurture, there is no nature, society &lt;i>creates&lt;/i> boys and girls. Thus, males can be reengineered into more feminine creatures for the “safety” of females. Despite that males of all species tend to be aggressive as dictated by biology, this is a clinical ailment from the perspective of social constructivism, to be expunged through psychological manipulation without regard to consequences. “I argue,” says Bartky, “that sexual fantasy, not just sexual behavior, should be made the object of moral justification.” But who’s to be in charge of thought control? The answer is, Bartky, her comrades at the university, and Congress.<br /><br />Bartky notes the objectification of women as indication of a sexist, suppressive society. But men are objectified as well, for their wealth, height, intelligence, appearance, items of display from expensive cars to big houses, or lack of these. (The genetic program that drives males of all species to exhibit resources which females look for to support offspring.) Though male oppression is not her topic, does that make society sexist and suppressive of males? Or is society simply a large-scale inflection of biology? Of course behaviors of both genders needs steering, but for Bartky only males are to be bridled, converted into something males can never be. In short, males are The Villain, to be treated as such.<br /><br />Human nature’s desire to emphasize “us versus them” as a means to unity loses none of its charm with Bartky. Until feminists theorists such as Bartky see themselves as heroic, rather than in terms of our modern currency as victims, they will continue to blame, seek vengeance, and demand certain payments and consideration &lt;i>from others&lt;/i>. In America, victim status carries significant rewards, including a freedom from challenge. Consequently, Bartky and so much of Women’s Studies at the university gets a free ride. One effect of Bartky’s work may be net reductions in male/female relations with associated depressions in fertility rate. As the planet doesn’t need more humans, this may be a positive outcome of her program.e Villain, to be treated as such.<br /><br />Human nature’s desire to emphasize “us versus them” as a means to unity loses none of its charm with Bartky.

What's to be gained from such an experience as rape? Just punishment? A sense of satisfaction for the rest of us because it didn't happen to us? Support for the notion \\"God works in mysterious ways\\"? Such adolescent ideas are one of the many reasons rape victims are further humiliated as made clear by this author.<br />Having encountered a woman who suffered rape I realized this was something I knew nothing about. As a male raised in a pre-60s atmosphere where respect for women was still taught to boys by parents - not by absent parents allowing Emenim to do the teaching - rape was too foreign for me to comprehend. In addition the advantages ambulance-chasing lawyers and fanatic feminists have taken by inventing rape victims made me suspicious of some claims made, including the now infamous assertion that all human males are born rapists and murderers. This author defines even \\"undress you looks\\" and catcalls as \\"small rapes\\". Thus not only reducing those who have been truly raped, but losing credibility by such ridiculous claims. Are we to believe that 1 in 4 women will be raped? Naturally, if definitions become as flimsy as those purported in this book then anything is rape so numbers become stratospheric. How can we know? By the time the author has made this reference the critical reader is long pondering agendas.<br />Human males are not generally born evil, but some become that way.

From this initial line it's clear he opposes the modern American fad advanced by, as Keyes notes, the covert totalitarianism of today's \\"tolerant\\" crowd who hold \\"the bigoted opinion that if you disagree with them you must be pretending\\".<br />As the only statesman and orator in America's last party primaries, Keyes is feared by some, not because he is black as Keyes once claimed, but because he is brilliant - a condition frightening to ignorance.<br />One of Keyes central refrains is that \\"we don't have money problems, we have moral problems\\". But morality is not fertile in the American mind through the expected and intended cultivation of education where respect and honor are reached through the application of Enlightenment reason with an understanding of natural rights, founding documents, their supporting material and the Founder's source and positions on such matters. Instead, for Keyes the moral alpha and omega are sourced in the Christian God, not reason, though he has a great talent for it. Where he fails is as a Creationist, wishing school boards across America could force Christianity into science class (tangentially referenced in his last preachy chapter). Keyes' respect for deep, open education is thus in doubt, mixed in the very least. And yet, on the contrary, Keyes has a respect for science, apparently as long as it does not squeeze his beliefs.  <br />An Alan Bloom disciple, Keyes knows alternative ways of thinking, giving him a capacity to see beyond his time and place. With this tool his book is a bit of revelation every other page.	2003-07-08

How did such radiance reverse itself? It boils down to cast of mind. This cast is what Princeton's Bernard Lewis reveals in unique and gripping style. An excellent writer, Lewis' practice is new. He provides cause and events to a limit, but so well constructed that he generates, naturally, questions from the reader just as we've absorbed enough. Then, next chapter, our curiosity peaked, these natural questions are addressed, expanded and the process repeats.<br />We find the Muslim world in a strengthening grip of literalists, fundamentalists and some radicals with a mindset currently unwilling or incapable (axiomatic by habit, not lack of intelligence) of separating religious from political philosophy (or even having political philosophy). Shades of religious fundamentalists in America are easily recognized and results in Islam should serve as warning and reminder of what the Founders knew as calamitous when church and state are joined. However, Lewis adds, \\"There is nothing in Islamic history to compare with emancipation, acceptance, and integration of other-believers and non-believers in the West; but equally, there is nothing in Islamic history to compare with the Spanish expulsion of Jews and Muslims, the Inquisition, the wars of religion...\\"<br />The old endorsement and support of slavery by Islamic law of Blacks and Whites (captured into bondage all the way from Iceland), its intolerance of \\"unbelievers\\" (with priority in the homeland) and repressive control of women (who, ironically, may own and dispose of property) is information not allowed for expression in our modern West. But through a lifetime of study and analysis with an eye to facts and events of history, Lewis tells the truth regardless, and tells it well.	2003-05-04

Any memory of pre-1960s America justifies his passion. Even lynching of African Americans was not illegal until Truman made it so in 1948. Images of fire hose and German Shepard attacks on peaceful black protestors or their white supporters remains a stark American memory. His book, however, is an alert to those of reason regardless of affiliation that the movement has run off its tracks. But that hasn't stopped its wreckage from continuing to plow a path of ruin through its original intent. As Schlesinger puts it, \\"A culture of ethnicity has arisen to denounce the idea of a melting pot, to protect and perpetuate separate ethnic and racial communities.\\" Its underlying philosophy is that America is not a nation of individuals but a nation of groups, he says; ethnicity is the defining experience; division into ethnic communities establishes the structure of American society and the fundamental meaning of American history. \\"Multiethnic dogma abandons historic purposes, replacing assimilation by fragmentation, integration by separation.\\" Our modern movements succeed where the Klan failed.<br /><br />Referencing multiculturalism he asks if it is the school's function to teach racial pride? When does obsession with difference threaten identity? Since this 1993 book, obsession has become an educational standard. Our calendar is split into months for one race pride or another (except white and European). It starts early - believing the purpose of history is therapeutic. He notes, \\"Once ethnic pride and self-esteem become the criterion for teaching history then certain things cannot be taught.\\" Schlesinger asks the question, \\"Why does anyone suppose that pride and inspiration are available only from people of the same ethnicity?\\" One wonders.<br /><br />Schlesinger's core warning is the same as that of the Founders, that \\"the virus of tribalism lies dormant, flaring up to destroy entire nations.\\" As Schlesinger notes, what began as valid leaders - like so much that began for the right reasons - have been hijacked for the benefits of opposition, not unification.	2003-05-04

The Right love Reagan for his results and character they claim returned pride in America. The Left hates him for his results and character the Right claims returned pride in America. Read either side and in the span of a few paragraphs, word choice, associations and missing information craft Reagan as either a Caesar or a delusional mad man bent on world war. <br />Cannon's book is no different. Not to say there are not valuable bits of information, but so overwhelmingly does Cannon show his loathing of Reagan that he seems unable to write an historical text. We find that as a boy Reagan claimed to have found a theatrical play so absorbing that he felt part of it. (Don't we all?) Like attacks on Hillary's conversations with Eleanor, this becomes an indication of Reagan's inability to distinguish fact from fiction. When Reagan became distant or openly ignored proceedings of meetings, it was not that he was politely queuing his staff to move on, but rather an example of ignorance and obliviousness. Reagan's nature to make others feel comfortable with humor or Hollywood stories is made to show he was out of touch and just another dumb actor, like those fawned over for their insights on Iraq. A youthful Reagan protest at Eureka (cause unspecified) is equated with the 60's - but we find Reagan accepting of only his own narrow cause, not that of peace movements burning down campus. Reagan's economic success is accompanied with the line that \\"not everyone was doing better\\" (does anyone really believe this is even possible?) and since Reagan sneered at welfare abuse, both are used as proof he was insensitive, ignoring that Reagan lived through a Depression era when standing in a soup line was not an entitlement but personally shameful, though necessary.<br />If you despise Reagan, Cannon will reinforce that orthodoxy. If you love Reagan, Cannon will only serve to irritate. If you want to know more about Reagan from a point of view you recognize from the outset as opposed to him, this book may provide additional information not seen elsewhere as Cannon spent a lifetime observing.	2003-04-03

The accomplishments and contributions of both authors are not in doubt (they have published many papers on the subject) but clarity of phenomena is wonting here. Part of this is due to the abstract nature of this subject and my early entry to it by what is a lovely text with supreme SAR imagery.

He doesn't view religion as our internal response to an external world, but considers science and religion as intellectual cousins, each providing answers. He goes some distance in showing the malleability of scientific practice - an act of \\"intellectual daring\\" when viewing fact and interpretation, experiment and theory as independent, while they are actually mixed up in perspectives we bring to nature. Which is more about scientists as humans than science as flawed. though not the end point as open publication, debate and test are employed. Science is refutable. He also touches upon absurdities proffered by \\"modern philosophers\\" who state we invent theories of nature, we do not discover them. As Polkinghorne notes, our theories wouldn't work if they didn't represent part of the truth. Nature continues to impose itself as final judge, regardless of fashionable politics.     Given that \\"unpictureable\\" electrons provide surprises, Polkinghorne is not surprised to find an unpictureable God to do the same. He accepts the oddness of quantum mechanics like he accepts the oddness of Jesus as simultaneously man and God. We're not sure how the oddness of say, astrology, with a longer history, many texts and practitioners may fit this view. To Polkinghorne the issue is not fact vs. opinion but interpreting our experience of the way the world really is. He views God as \\"faithful\\" to man and nature. The natural gift of a faithful God being reliability of his creation's operation. Ignoring tribal aspects of the Hebrew God, God is also loving, thus granting independence, which alone by itself would be disarray, so both order and independence in the universe. \\"Chance is a sign of freedom, not blind purposelessness,\\" writes Polkinghorne. (A message to, Creationists.) \\"Shuffling explorations of chance lead to both deterioration and fruitful novelty.\\"     Does a world with concentration camps look like the creation of a powerful, loving God? With this we meet the \\"free will defense\\" - the potential for moral evil is the penalty for the greater good of human freedom. And what about natural disasters like quake fallen churches killing 50000 in 1755 Lisbon, or cancer? Polkinghorne provides the \\"free process defense\\" - God faithfully letting nature follow nature's laws. The same biochemical rules allowing evolution also enables cancer. It's a package deal. Natural disasters are not gratuitous, but a necessary cost of life. Disregarding what need an all knowing God would have for experiential suffering, Polkinghorne supplies the relieving Christian view - God is not simply a pitying, compassionate spectator, but a fellow participant in the world's suffering, known through the experience of Jesus.	2003-02-15

And how - without assistance by unnatural applications of reason and science - we're precisely the same if allowed to be. It raises questions of how we can possibly save our natural world and truly believe in a spiritual reality if we and the natural world are subjected to modern thinking found to be so successful.<br /><br />Focusing on Sumer and Egypt we find the ancients didn't separate man from nature. Man was part of society embedded in nature, dependent on cosmic forces. Long before scriptural declarations of conquest over nature, man was not in opposition. They obviously struggled \\"against\\" a \\"hostile\\" environment, but this account is our language describing their situation, not their state of mind. Reminiscent of Campbell's clarification between modern and ancient perspectives as \\"it\\" vs. \\"thou,\\" our authors describe this difference as \\"subject\\" vs. \\"object.\\" The ancients had one mode of expression, thought, and speech - the personal. Everything had a will and personality revealing itself. The ancients could reason logically, but such intellectual detachment was hardly compatible with their experience of reality. Impersonal laws (physics) did not satisfy their understanding. When the river doesn't rise, it's not due to lack of rain - the river refused to rise. You'd not hurt yourself in a fall - the ground chose to hurt you, or not. The ancient view was qualitative and concrete, not quantitative and abstract.<br /><br />In science we apply a procedure, progressively reducing phenomena until subjected to universal laws. We \\"de-complicate\\" systems to understand them. There's a hierarchy of complexity making planetary motions simpler systems than say, living cells, thus more or less complete theories of each, but we've proven since Galileo initiated modern science that we're so close to the truth of nature (the judge of our understanding) that our theories earn acceptance through success of their predictions. We really did build Voyager to that understanding and it really did what we thought it would when released to nature's command - eight billion miles from earth, still obeying our grasp of nature. Furthermore, accurate theories are able to predict things never dreamed possible when created. Relativity still yields such surprises. We see phenomena as manifestations of general laws, not by what makes them peculiar.<br /><br />The authors term the ancient mind as \\"mythopoetic.\\" That perspective is why scriptures were written when they were and not anymore - writings imbibed with mystery and inflation of life, assumed lost to critical reason and economic forces. But the mythopoetic mind is still here, the natural mind we are born with. It's why we have palm readers, cults, astrologers, ghosts, UFOs, Creationists, pet psychics, TV conversations with the dead, best selling books on how to \\"know\\" God, and beliefs that flying jets into buildings will send their pilots to heaven. All expanding lives otherwise sterilized by 9-to-5, traffic jams, poverty. In Mexico, women are advised to remain inside during a solar eclipse, least they become spontaneously pregnant. As my Aunt said of the Space Shuttle Columbia, \\"If God wanted us to be in space he'd given us wings.\\" If God wanted us to drive cars he'd given us wheels, or to live under roofs, he'd have put shingles on our head. What some battle as absurd is also quite natural, dangerous and capable of elevating life, avoiding deconstruction and reductionism applied to humans made of more than carbon and water. A dilemma revealed by this book.

US	52831327	R1Z1OY4JKA10WP	0195121198	670884283	Sex and the Origins of Death	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Why we die and how to beat it	From the outset, what UCLA's Wm. Clark reports is staggering: Death is \\"not an obligatory attribute of life,\\" he writes, and did not appear with the advent of it. Cellular aging resulting in death may not have occurred for more than a billion years after life's first entry on earth. Programmed cell death (PCD) which we suffer (displayed through wrinkles and forgetfulness) seems to have arisen about the time cells were experimenting with sex.<br /><br />Sex is an energy costly activity, engaged in because it rolls the genetic dice, inviting variations with each new offspring. An advantage because with environmental change what was well suited in the old world is often not suited for the new. Gene variations result, and through natural selection, a few offspring amongst the dying progenitors may survive to save the species. For example, bacteria reproduce though cloning themselves, and can do so at a rate of 16 million per hour from one parent (take your antibiotics). But when the environment becomes harsh, bacterial parents spontaneously engage in sex, swapping genes with others as a gamble on survival.<br /><br />In a description of catastrophic cell death, Clark displays a talent to meet or exceed even Sagan's best - clear, rich, compelling. Here heart attack, and the wonder of cell machinery resist the inevitable as systems and their backups struggle to counter power failures and starvation in a chain reaction of fading miracles. Like a community, some components are wholly unaware of disaster while others sacrifice themselves, transferring energy to last lines of defense - pumps stationed in cell walls countering a siege of water pressing in about to wash them away.<br /><br />Such stunning, intentioned actions of this tiny, helpless, complex organism, the cell (of which we possess about 100 trillion - as many cells as there are stars in the nearest 400 spiral galaxies including the Milky Way!) is starkly contrasted against our cell's decision to commit suicide.This happens when life is late, or as early as the womb when ancient relics of evolution are flushed out of us - like reminders of an ocean origin when interdigital webbing of our onetime fins are removed through PCD, leaving what's left between our fingers. Once the nucleus decides to pull the trigger, one last set of instructions emerge as its DNA begins disassembling. All the while a stack of unread commands are being executed by unwary elements of the cell. The cell detaches from its neighbors, undulates, breaking into globules while still ignorant workers in these blobs work away, floating into a void, devoured by immune systems. Awful...<br /><br />But there are rays of hope for immortality. \\"Growth factors\\" are given to cells like lymphocytes to put a safety on their trigger. And there are executioners in this tragedy, T-Cells. Having spotted an invader they do not murder the foreigner, they command the interloper to kill itself, orders dutifully followed. T-Cells know the security code.<br /><br />Clarks notes an important difference between us and other \\"primitive\\" life forms. For example, paramecium dodge death by letting their macro-nuclei run the show while a micro-version lays dormant. After enough cell splitting, it has sex with another paramecium. Its macro-nuclei suffers PCD and the micro takes over as a newly minted micro-nucleus goes to sleep. Once eukaryotic cells (what we're made of) became multicellular, reproductive DNA would be not only kept in separate nuclei (as the paramecium) but in separate cells - our germ cells (sperm, egg). The rest of us, our bodies, are their guardians, not only redundant and irrelevant but we turn dangerous with too many divisions. When our germ cells meet others, clocks are reset just as they are for paramecium. Sex can save our germ cells but it cannot save us.<br /><br />These growth factors, security codes, telemeres or some other mechanism may finally be commandeered to salvage us from oblivion. For now, as Clark writes, we must die and there are many mechanisms built into us to make sure we do. Death does not just happen, it is worked toward, with safeguards to assure cells don't backslide into immortality - as cancer cells do, a recipe for disaster. The winner is our species because germ cells are immortal through sex as we contribute molecular chains of ourselves to the future and whoever is made of us. Clark reveals this and so much more. A pure joy to read.	2003-01-27
US	52831327	R3EV3QEMCBZ0OE	0156006537	509337312	Becoming Human: Evolution and Human Uniqueness	Books	4	9	11	N	N	The beautiful and the ugly about human animals	Tattersall gives us primitive social history; a bounded evolutionary history; and a most surprising - though distressing - anatomical history of these expensive organs we carry about in our skulls. Expensive because they consume over 20% of our calories whether we use them or not. Given the state of civilization and politics it may be no surprise we burn hardly more calories when thinking than asleep.<br /><br />The goal here is to find why humans are different. Chimps make tools, dolphins have the largest brain-to-body-mass ratio of any species on earth, Neanderthal ceremonially buried their dead, gorillas can be taught sign language, baboons engage in deception as they attribute states of mind to others to predict their behavior. Jane Goodall even witnessed bands of chimps make coordinated war on each other not so unlike the way humans did in earnest once accumulations from the agriculture revolution gave us something serious to kill for. But others have not painted cave walls in southwest Europe (30000ya), wrote sonnets or split atoms. As far as we know, claims Tattersall, a dramatic difference is rule based, abstract language. Arbitrary sounds associated to objects (the sound \\"house\\" only means \\"house\\" to those who speak English) or more intangibly, to symbolic references - mathematics, metaphysics, democracy. The order of these arbitrary sounds convey their own meaning. \\"Man paints house.\\" \\"House paints man.\\" Hence the rules - grammar - such that listeners using the same code understand correctly the intended message. Without the rules and vocabulary, a foreign tongue - if you've ever heard one - sounds like one continuous modulated word.<br /><br />Throughout the book we wonder if we are really better off now than in the harsh, survivalist past. Through success in controlling the environment, our ancestors could have never imagined to what ends we would carry this emergent property of stellar byproducts structured in the form of brains. This control also allowed for an art explosion - according to Tattersall an element of existence central to ancient man. While the system we moderns created makes art alien and impractical - or worse, creates \\"modern art\\" - the past allowed our ancestors to explore this innately human characteristic. Gould's punctuated equilibrium seems to apply here to human innovation as readily as it does to speciation - periods of abrupt development followed by periods of stasis.<br /><br />Of utmost importance is Tattersall's note on climate's affect on the human trajectory. The coordination of climate change and human creative behavior may seem obvious (stated again some years later in Spencer Wells', Pandora's Seed) - e.g. if it's suddenly colder, invent a coat. But we find, for example, that cave painting peaked with the last glacial maxima. Did selective pressures, including the loss of once available prey animals, expand the perception of art as magic over animals imaged? That is, did a natural ice age select for accelerating abstractions such as religion - the calling of powers to calm a changing world? (Given Neanderthal burials, the ice age was far from the first such hypothetical natural selection of behaviors.) Interestingly these paintings are composed of fewer large predators over time. Were the painters simply reporting the numbers - eliminated by climate change or human success in the competition game?<br /><br />An excellent section on brain anatomy clarifies our biggest problem. The combination of onion-like layering and expansion of existent features to make up those layers, resulting in the untidy evolution of our brains built over early versions all the way back to common mammal, even reptilian-like ancestors. The sad news is that structure implies behavior. Our higher thought centers are mediated by sections in charge of our lowest functions - feeding, fighting, fleeing, sex. Is this why males so frequently compromise themselves for females against better judgments, rationalizingirrational acts, only to suffer their actions after hormones fade? Males of many species die in that contest. That fabulous machine in our skulls is also a mess and far from an ideal design. It makes us warlike, yet compassionate, lawyers, yet artists. We're stuck with it and as Tattersall tells it, this, contrary to modern historians, is why history repeats itself.	2003-01-26

The disjointed nature of some one or two line sections leaves support for their conclusions vacant, making them sound pushy. Hoffer does not allow devotion and dedication sourced in conviction and confidence. For Hoffer the holy cause is always a substitute for a loss of faith in oneself. The theme is that all mass movements – good, bad, Left, Right, social, religious, national – share a family likeness. Mass movements generate a proclivity for united action (challenge not welcome), fanaticism, fervent hope, hatred, intolerance, and release powerful human energy demanding blind faith and single-hearted allegiance. “For though ours is a godless age,” writes Hoffer, “it is the very opposite of irreligious.” Sure to raise hackles, Hoffer writes, “The hammer and sickle or swastika are in a class with the cross.” But he does not mean they are equivalent movements, only that they have equivalent features. In a nutshell, this is human behavior with reason removed, a tool of the passions. Which is not to imply movements have no good rewards. As Hoffer notes, some have organized, and others helped shake the West out of Dark Ages. Interestingly, movements have stages of development from initial radicalism to eventual conservatism in which those attracted seek careers in the new order, not to mold a new world, but to preserve the present. From zeal to orthodoxy. Good book., some have organized and others helped shake the West out of the Dark Ages.<br />Carried along in the wake of zealots breaking ground are the \\"not so zealous\\" and those just plain unaware of their surroundings. Though what we today perceive as \\"normal\\", all of it is result of a variety of mass movements from the very advent of agriculture to the invention of the city as a dominant way of life. But Hoffer focuses on movements sprung from an idea, value or perception that are matters of the heart more than matters of technology or comfort. <br />Interestingly, movements have stages of development from initial radicalism to eventual conservatism in which those attracted seek careers in the new order, not molding a new world but preserving the present. The zeal of experience, replaced by orthodoxy. Consider transitions in the Church from apostles to Bishops, 1917 Russia from revolution to rules of communist productivity, riots of 1960's America to the squelching of free speech by graying activists holding university chairs. \\"Believer\\" shines on these apparently disparate acts a new light.	2002-10-07

Though many of the epic's tablets were discovered in Assurbanipal's Assyrian library (7th century B.C), parts of this book appear to originate from around 3000 B.C. Long before the Assyrians, 1800 years before the Hebrews, and, in fact, before anybody as this story originated with the hard-bitten people of Sumer, the first civilization, who happened to have been utterly lost from history until the 19th century A.D. The very civilization to invent the wheel, the city, the sexigesimal system governing the sweep of hands on your watch and, most importantly, writing. Say \\"alcohol,\\" and you speak Sumerian - as they apparently invented that too. \\"Hard-bitten\\" because while the Egyptians would celebrate Nile floods, Sumerians cursed themselves for having deserved such punishment as a flooded Tigris or Euphrates. To Egyptians the sun was life. To Sumerians the sun was relentless. Suffering is an excellent source of creativity (though the Egyptians did well with less) and Gilgamesh reflects this in both its creativity and diagnosis.<br /><br />Although very old, his story is forever new. Gilgamesh is - as stated in the introduction - emblematic of our concern with mortality, the struggle for knowledge and escape from the common lot of man. As a mortal, Gilgamesh is condemned to death, but he doesn't take his fate lying down. So, like all good mythologies, he sets out on a great adventure to rectify his problem, encountering gods, monsters and his best friend, Enkidu, the \\"savage man,\\" who is at home with the animals, until enticed by the civilized Gilgamesh with a woman - something Enkidu never saw before (in myths, a symbol of man's complications when leaving his natural state).<br /><br />Most interestingly, Gilgamesh reaches \\"where the sun rises\\" to meet Upnapishtim. Upnapishtim is by now famous for saving \\"the seed of all living creatures\\" on a boat, whose dimensions are given by a rogue god friendly to man. All before a great worldwide flood sent by other capricious gods, because humans were making too much noise, keeping the gods from sleep. (That Noah mimics the Upnapishtim myth should be no surprise as Sumer influenced the Levant for thousands of years after its passing.)<br /><br />When Enkidu dies Gilgamesh morns, \\"How can I rest when Enkidu, whom I love is dust and I too shall die and be laid in the earth forever.\\" In the end Gilgamesh is \\"mocked by fate, lost opportunities, wasted hopes and swallowed by death.\\" Apparently, no matter how many gods you have - and the Sumerians had hundreds, one even for the pick-axe - death remains a mystery, and confidence of reward a hunch.<br /><br />A wonderful journey into the mind of humanities first civilization, greater understanding of scriptures to follow, and a clear signal that the deepest concerns of our human condition remain unaltered no matter where or when.	2002-09-29

It was Bloom's life work - his profession at the University Of Chicago - to compare human eras and their standards. Through his research no one has so completely uncovered the ills of our time, or affirmed what is positive. His courage to face modern dogma made Bloom hated by those adhering to new orthodoxies and open to their character assassinations, but Bloom wrote anyway.<br /><br />Contrary to relativism of the new movements and their extinguishing of deep education - which in the end is a search for the right answers - Bloom claims there are indeed answers to questions concerning the human condition (thus the inspiration), and that \\"not obvious\\" does not mean \\"unavailable.\\" \\"The liberally educated person,\\" he writes, \\"is one who is able to resist the easy and preferred answers, not because he is obstinate but because he knows others worthy of consideration.\\"<br /><br />Today's social relativism is considered \\"not a theoretical insight\\" but a \\"moral postulate of a free society,\\" and hence the current totalitarianism we experience from fundamentalism - Left or Right as one dare not oppose such rule.<br /><br />How did America reach its current state of intolerance to ideas without agreement on first principles? Bloom takes us on a lively tour toward an answer, engagingly written. As example, early on in America, religion was demoted from the level of \\"knowledge\\" to that of \\"opinion\\" in order to defuse dangerous elements of its passion we still see today in the Levant, but, importantly, the right to religious belief was not lost. This demotion was possible if society were to shrink its claims to moral certainty, subordinating old ways (but not abandoning them) to Enlightenment's Natural Rights. Today this process of \\"value shrinkage\\" is taken to such extreme that the original ideas providing its basis are attacked, claiming each period has its \\"preferences.\\" None aresuperior, as that would be, by modern perspectives, discrimination. Today, \\"subordination\\" is equivalent to suppression. This radical democracy claims limits on anything to be arbitrary (since truth is now relative). \\"The point is not to correct the mistakes and really be right,\\" writes Bloom, \\"rather it is not to think you are right at all.\\"<br /><br />Bloom clarifies that \\"passion\\" and \\"commitment\\" have become the new political validations replacing reason and critical thinking. What the Founders worked so hard to balance (faction) due to its inherent opposition to the common good, is now promoted as a central role of government with its fondness for \\"groups.\\" With \\"common good\\" abandoned, factions are no longer problematic. What the Founders never imagined has set in - not a tyranny of the majority they strived to counterbalance, but a tyranny of passionate, committed minority interest groups.<br /><br />Concerning multiculturalism in education Bloom notes that Greeks searched out other cultures too (as we still should), but for wholly different reasons - to learn what they had to teach about the human condition, not to nullify their own society as we now do. Moderns maintain America's Constitution was the white man's corrupt document designed to suppress, and that Western ways are a bias to be cleansed by exposure to other cultures through multicultural studies. But this is not to learn what they have to teach so much as it is a political maneuver to dismantle the West, its values, standards and science. Intellectual openness used to invite a quest for knowledge and certitude, while the opposite is now true. Open-mindedness means closing ones mind to our very roots. As though to deny them will settle a score with our history for having done so much evil, while conveniently dismissing the good.<br /><br />While Fundamentalists assumed that removing reason from the mind would remove bias and prejudice, all they have done is vanquished our best tool for correction.Such is the state of the American mind. Though American education is in crisis, Bloom has given us the gift of knowing there is hope on our own.	2002-09-28
US	52831327	R2KXC8YN5ELBLY	0451528123	857677473	Democracy in America (Signet Classics)	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	America defined, and over 165 years ago	This abridged version is an excellent summary of \\"Democracy in America.\\" Tocqueville knocked me off my feet when I read this book in 1997 and look forward to the full version in 2015. It's the best and worst in America, laid bare by a Frenchman who came to The States in 1835 to find for himself whether individuality, freedom and liberty could survive the dangers of equality and democracy. \\"[The nation] depends on [its people to determine] whether the principle of equality is to lead them to servitude or knowledge, to freedom or barbarism...\\" writes de Tocqueville. Only an outsider could so accurately assess a people. But de Tocqueville is eminently balanced, overall in favor (in my opinion) of what he saw, and thus dismissed in France upon his return.<br /><br />He notes an American addiction to the practical rather than theoretical. A pragmatic concern, not for the lofty and perfect, but quick and useful, with relentless ambition, feverish activity, and unending quests for devices and shortcuts. Resulting from a requirement for survival on the frontier, these observations remain the good, bad and ugly of our modern selves. Resourceful technocrats expanding comfort, health, safety or wealth by anyone with ingenuity and persistence; our exchange of youth for old age in the workplace, improving our standard of living at the expense of our quality of life; and America's shallow nature of thought, sealed up in sound-bites.<br /><br />Tocqueville finds in the sacred name of majority, a tyranny over the mind of Americans as oppressive and formidable as any other tyranny - arguably more so by virtue of its acceptance. Where monarchs failed to control thought, democracy succeeds. Opinion polls our politicians subscribe to have a power of conformity. \\"I know of no country in which there is so little independence of mind and real freedom of discussion as in America,\\" he writes. \\"It is as if the natural bond which unites the opinions of man to his tastes, and his actions to his principles is now broken...\\"<br /><br />Of literature and art we see why so much pulp crowds the bookshelf and bamboozles fill our galleries; \\"Style will frequently be fantastic, incorrect, overburdened and loose,\\" he writes. \\"Almost always vehement and bold. Authors will aim at rapidity of execution more than at perfection of detail... The object of authors will be to astonish rather than to please, to stir the passions more than charm the taste.\\"<br /><br />A fascinating evolution of perception - of self and state - unfolds as the democratization of education, property ownership and the vote expands. Wiping away the trappings of privilege transforms the serfdom mindset. We see the perception of opinion as both scoffed when originating in individuals other than ourselves, and, conversely, the worship of opinion as a manifestation of majority rule. Americans, once lionizing the intrepid individual, instead took a turn to having the most pride in their sameness. Armed with this understanding, today we see each group define itself by its signals - body language, speech cadence and inflection, vocabulary and dress. Every group has its code words, actions and look. A time consuming process of investigating character is exchanged for quicker, simpler signs.<br /><br />The climax is reached with de Tocqueville's troubling \\"either or\\"; \\"We must understand what is wanted of society and its government,\\" he writes. \\"Do you wish to give a certain elevation of the human mind and teach it to regard the things of this world with generous feelings, to inspire men with a scorn of mere temporal advantages, to form and nourish strong convictions and keep alive a spirit of honorable devotedness? Is it your object to refine the habits, embellish the manners and cultivate the arts, to promote the love of poetry, beauty and glory? If you believe such to be the principle object of society, avoid the government of democracy, for it would not lead you with certainty to the goal.<br /><br/>\\"But if you hold it expedient to divert the moral and intellectual activity of man to the production of comfort and promotion of general well being; if a clear understanding be more profitable to a man than genius; if your object be not to stimulate the virtues of heroism, but the habits of peace; if you had rather witness vices and crimes and are content to meet with fewer noble deeds, provided offences be diminished in the same proportion; if, instead of living in the midst of a brilliant society you are contented to have prosperity around you...to ensure the greatest enjoyment and to avoid the most misery...then establish democratic institutions.\\" Tocqueville, one of those rare and timeless human treasures.moral and intellectual activity of man to the production of comfort and promotion of general well being; if a clear understanding be more profitable to a man than genius; if your object be not to stimulate the virtues of heroism, but the habits of peace; if you had rather witness vices and crimes and are content to meet with fewer noble deeds, provided offences be diminished in the same proportion; if, instead of living in the midst of a brilliant society you are contented to have prosperity around you...to ensure the greatest enjoyment and to avoid the most misery...then establish democratic institutions.\\" Tocqueville, one of those rare and timeless human treasures.	2002-09-28

The power of science was made manifest by Sagan through his ability to write well. His \\"Demon Haunted World\\" is nearly peerless in clarity, importance of ideas and a warning every American should read to comprehend what is happening to us in the present.<br />But \\"Billions\\" opens with a chapter describing numbers and yawns through several more sections of similarly simple concepts told a thousand times by Sagan and others, then begins to turn ugly, as not his science and insights are revealed, but Sagan's politics comes forward. He claims \\"cosmic justice\\" that light skinned people suffer skin cancer at rates higher than dark skinned because \\"lights\\" invented CFCs. Lumping all \\"light skins\\" including women and infants, of many nations, into the same bucket as a handful of chemists and business interests who Sagan blames for CFC creation with its subsequent damage to earth's ozone layer. He justifies Japan's ruthless aggression to \\"protect\\" oil supplies during World War Two, then rebukes America for doing the same. (That the United States is a wasteful energy glutton is not debatable, but sixties era double standards raise suspicions of truthfulness for careful readers.) After having ignored effective German U-boats in those \\"vast and impassable oceans\\" \\"protecting\\" America, Sagan disregards fear generated by Soviet betrayal of Potsdam, blockade of Berlin, the \\"iron curtain\\", Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, their work on nuclear weapons and Stalin's murderous record as initiators of the arms race - \\"We had nothing to fear,\\" he writes. \\"So we built nuclear weapons and their delivery systems. We initiated [the arms race]...\\" But as Ann Druyan later states, truth was what mattered most to Carl. Sagan's half-truths make this a paradox.<br />Finally, in the last five pages preceding the Epilogue we almost taste the Sagan of old in a pleasant survey of science. In the Epilogue written by Druyan, we witness Sagan demonstrating such strength in confronting his fate that admiration for him soars. Her description of their love makes reading this section unlikely without interruptions for composure. \\"As we looked deeply into each other's eyes, it was a shared conviction that our wondrous life together was ending forever.\\" Amongst the wreckage of love in our modern era, who could not feel empathy, and envy, for these two lovers at the end of a life as rich and stratospheric as Sagan's?<br />Sadly, Sagan's last book is a poor reflection of his talents and one this reader hopes he will not be recalled for. As I read I kept referring to glittering reviews on the inside cover, wondering what book the New York Times and others were referring to? I can only speculate they were lauding Sagan because he was dead and politically liberal.<br />The non-fiction reader is always on guard, comparing, challenging and reconciling, but rarely does one find themselves so suspect of every line, or simply sedated. I wish Sagan could rise up from his grave, pulling every copy of this book back with him, wiping its memory from the minds of those who suffered through it, such that the better image of Sagan could remain unsoiled.ritten by Druyan, we witness Sagan demonstrating such strength in confronting his fate that admiration for him soars.

To be vitally human there are a few authors one must read - Shakespeare, Plato, Rousseau, Alan Bloom and Eugene Hecht. With only limited exaggeration - notable among man's achievements is Hecht's new 4th edition of Optics. The first edition was the central (and only) text assigned in junior year optics for physics majors at many universities in the 1980's. As a near adolescent I was pleased by expert writing and well delivered humor in those far off years of college life. <br />The wonders of electromagnetics - which leads to everything in our modern age of electronics, radar, telescopes and computers - is beautifully clarified with clear pictures, concise description and completing examples in this new edition. <br />I hope Hecht lives to be a thousand such that the hundredth edition of Optics can enlighten people in the 31st century with as much joy and fascination as his 4th edition does today. <br />After so many years away I find Hecht there again to help me, not this time to peak inside the mind of nature but to make a living, and do so with added pleasure, knowing Hecht continues to improve the nearly perfect.	2002-07-14

Even so, one sees a very different image of Reagan than what is popularized and by now accepted by default, without question, as facts of history. I was astonished at what I assumed to be true only because pundits and the media said so.<br />We are frequently told that Reagan was a doting \\"pawn\\" of other more intelligent powers. But D'Souza reminds us of 1976 when Reagan challenged the incumbent president - a bold move within either party. Having lost the first five states his campaign manager unilaterally established a withdrawal meeting with Ford. But Reagan, under tremendous pressure to pull out, even from his wife, refused, stating he would take his ideas all the way to the convention, even if he lost every state. Then he started to win and Ford narrowly escaped. In `82 Reagan was vilified with media prejudice (see Bernard Goldberg's \\"Bias\\") as Paul Volker (a Carter appointee) restricted the money supply, while Reagan himself signed the biggest tax cut in history. Keynesian's - advocates of centralized government intervention - shouted for Reagan's head. These actions would produce nothing they said, as tax cuts provided money to spend while shrinking the supply took it away. Who would not have changed course given the economic downturn from already depressed levels? Reagan defied pressure again with defense spending - accepting enormous deficits, as Democrats and Republicans were not willing to exchange their social programs (and associated votes) for his defense promise. Clear about financial and political costs, to Reagan, defeating the Soviets with technological strength vs. weakness was worth the price. Finally, Reagan refused Gorbachev when he tried to trade away Star Wars at Reykjavik - a deal Reagan nearly bought with his strong desire to end the Cold War, eliminating nuclear weapons. Again Reagan took a terrible beating in the media. <br />We find Reagan a simple and practical man. He saw the world in uncomplicated ways that our elite emphatically state the world can no longer be seen in. To Reagan there was good and evil, right and wrong. He focused on larger pictures of his intent with little or no concern for details, infighting, insults, meetings or defections. While Billy Graham pronounced he had caviar everyday in Russia and John Kenneth Galbraith, among so many intellectuals, noted the success and permanence of the USSR, Reagan could not believe it. To him it simply violated common sense to think that the communist system would motivate, inspire and succeed with human nature better than capitalism and democracy. Even the master international diplomat, Richard Nixon, derided Reagan for not accepting the USSR as it was and always would be, writing insultingly about Reagan for years. <br />Actions noted do not match the definition of \\"pawn\\". Nor was Reagan simply stubborn. Reaganomics worked, reducing Carter's inflation from 12% to 3%, interest rates from 21% to 9%, leading to the greatest economic expansion since World War Two. (Unable to disconnect the economic rocket from Reagan's guidance, the next tactic, now so worn, was to snivel, \\"but not all Americans are doing equally well.\\"  They were supposed to be?) In ten years of Détente nine nations fell into the Soviet sphere and seventy percent of South America was communist or socialist. By the close of Reagan's administration 90% of South America was democratic and nine other countries fell out of Soviet influence with Berlin's Wall tumbling down under the hammers of freedom. Reagan and Thatcher changed the world into the global economy we see today - with all its problems they are not that of dictators, KGB and nuclear holocaust.<br />As we discover, contrary to fashion, Reagan was focused with a determined conviction. His ideas were no accident or implant. After years of writing, meeting people across America through his position atGE and a life experience showing how hostile big government was (is) to everyday Americans, Reagan sensed the country was ready for his message. Reganomics turned out to be a revolutionary insight, not irresponsible idiocy. Time after time he defied pressure and won the biggest prize since World War Two. The economic impacts of Reagan's defense debt, according to economist Lawrence Lindsey, has been a \\"fantastic payoff - the best money we ever spent\\".  <br />Apparently, today's vogue position on Reagan is intended to discount him, adopting politically correct propaganda promoted by his opposition. The same opposition he kicked out of university buildings commandeered by force and violence by the hypocrisy laden 60's \\"peace\\" generation. The same opposition who rode 20th century orthodoxy, stating that government should regulate, escort and pamper its citizens. Reagan ran against the 20th century and fundamentalist movements born in the 60's. For that they never forgot him, determined to bury his success under the suffocation of revisionist history. Fortunately for some, still open enough to challenge modern dogma, D'Souza has a book to read.	2002-07-14

This book is for anyone interested in tracing Western perspectives from the emergence of reason under the thumb of ignorance and dogma, through the advent of science, to muddlings of our present era returning to ignorance and dogma under the confines of censorship and totalitarian Political Correctness. <br />Driving forces that made America and the West what it became are surveyed - forces including the birth of reason, influence of science and our Western notion of progress. Focused on their topic, our authors properly consider what matters most to America and the West, excluding a vast array of other cultures because those cultures (Mayan, Hutu, Chilean, Eskimo - a virtually endless list) have little or absolutely nothing to do with Western development. Thus we are saved from useless inclusion of irrelevance. Nor do they waste trees on a cacophony of \\"voices\\" with something opposing to say about the facts of history as though their intent is to produce committee minutes. Noted, repeatedly, are oversights and outright suppression of females as bared from the men's club, but it is treated as a fact of history, not a call to arms.<br />Results of these forces included exaltation of history and \\"heroic science\\" as a means of positive reference for America (and Europe) that has since been attacked by factions wishing in part to make history's picture larger while reinventing history in ways that deny credit for anyone but their own group. It requires imagination, but the authors clarify how successful Postmodernist relatives have been in advancing the most ridiculous ideas, and, as noted, would not be given a second thought were they not becoming so dominant at our universities. Ideas such as; We invent theories in science, we do not discover them; What was not said or not written is more important than what was - as everyone in every period is said to have been political and fully so with no regard for truth. Thus whatever point was made was in fact a diversion hiding what they \\"really\\" meant. This brings to bear creative talents of our finest historians and \\"text interpreters\\" as they expend lifetimes inventing, out of thin air, what the truth \\"really\\" was. A boundless exercise as what was not spoken or written remains infinite, while what was is limited. And such conclusions from those who paradoxically preach \\"the truth is, there is no truth, and that's the truth\\".  <br />Thankfully the authors state the obvious. \\"Relativism, a modern corollary of skepticism\\" not only reasonably questions but is now used to promote doubt in knowledge of any kind, while to the contrary our authors argue \\"truths about the past are possible, even if they are not absolute\\". For those who claim we can know nothing, and that even our theories of nature are pure, politicized imagination, we are reminded that artifacts exist - remains of civilizations, buildings, monuments, graveyards on battlegrounds, movements resulting from written words and speeches. As for inventing scientific theories as simply another false Western bias, one may wonder how all those atoms and galaxies know our political views well enough to behave precisely as predicted by theory. <br />The authors commit the error of confusing science with scientists - science being an ideal, while scientists remain human - and they wrongly promote a reference which claims the defense industry as dominated by scientists when it is rather dominated by engineers. This offering to reinforce a notion that science is political. (Indeed, scientists may be.) With an open mindedness bordering on mere \\"inclusivity\\" Postmodernists are given limited credit, stating they \\"deserve\\" to be heard on some matters - which left me wondering why serious historians would squander time on sophomoric reflections of declining education and trite exercises in sensitivity toward the absurd. We might consider the notion of a moonmade of green cheese still holds promise if a certain vast system of conditions concerning our measurements and conceptions exist - say that we are in fact being manipulated by aliens. But any advancement in our understanding of the human condition is bound to be wasted. As a German engineer once said, \\"I have no time to waste on probable failures.\\" So why waste it?<br />An assumption is made from the outset - common to anyone's era, which is not challenged - that the past was incorrect in their perspective. Perhaps we are wrong in refuting their positivism. Instead we assume without question the heroic models were flawed. Despite what we consider the past's delusions and narrow mindedness, we are never offered an option that their perspective, though incomplete, was superior to our own in which winners at the auction are those with the most terrible things to say about who we are. Perhaps the authors saw this as too \\"inclusive\\" and a probable failure.	2002-07-14

Unexpected turns and shocking realizations of what a fundamentalist sector of America has implemented makes this book read like a chilling spy novel. The reader hesitates to turn each page, fearful but driven to see just what happens next. The roots of modern, institutionalized hypocrisy hang in a harsh light from the very beginning of chapter one and the Water Buffalo Affair at the University Of Pennsylvania. Quotes of university administrators and their staggering leaps in the illogical, cloaked in language that could only be from another world peppers speech, writings and vindictive suppression created by those directing The New Left and their movements at Harvard, Stanford, Michigan.     Old meanings of classical liberal education have been evacuated by totalitarian regimes revealed as virtually controlling every university in America and determined to crush equal rights in favor of protecting their own dogma of \\"selected rights\\" like some fanatic religion. The New Left makes no bones about their despotic intent as chapter four and Marcuse's Revenge shows.   As a staff member of a Big Ten university I witnessed the same duplicity, double standards and mental acrobatics committed to protect new orthodoxies as those exposed in this book - and observed nearly every day. Such lack of principle and lifting the blindfold of Lady Justice is quite acceptable as it perpetually satisfies a vendetta. Apparently the Fundamentalist Left is as willing to commit their sins as any adulterous Jimmy Swaggart or fraudulent Jim and Tammy Fae Baker on the Right because their own personal ends justify any means. And this from those very people who embraced free speech and other Constitutional guarantees, until they had the power to discard them, suppressing other views, declaring the Constitution void. Precisely the type of wicked preferential treatment afforded to the Klan in ugly years past is now embraced by those who protested such ignorance and vulgarity.     Read this book, butbe prepared to see obfuscating language of new movements for the violent assaults they are.	2002-05-15

Among other criticisms at the time - some found to be valid with experimentation, some not - pundits claimed an anti-missile missile shield would be impossible as it was equivalent to hitting a bullet with a bullet. Though inaccurate - as bullets do not have onboard active radars, nor do they travel at such elevated velocities. Fitzgerald uses such predictive claims as those made shortly after the initial announcement to support her theme, then fails to include what really happened, and during the Reagan administration itself, not ten years after.<br />Fourteen years before this book was published in 1986 (not 1999) the possibility of a Star Wars defense system was proven at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico when an anti-missile missile hit its target in the first test of its kind. The highest priority system among all armed forces research at that time, it was envisioned to represent a last line of defense against incoming ICBMs that escaped space based weapons aimed at the boost and mid-course phase. The program was called SR-HIT (Small Radar - Homing Interceptor Technology) and was built by LTV Aerospace And Defense (now Lockheed Martin). With SR-HIT's next four-in-a-row successful intercepts of simulated ICBMs and tactical ballistic missiles the Army stopped further testing such that development schedules could be advanced and, at least for some length of time, due to questions concerning the validity of testing anti-ballistic missiles given the ABM treaty. SR-HIT has now entered production (3/2002) as PAC-3 (see Lockheed's website), after fourteen-in-a-row successful launch/intercepts in its last phase of development.<br />Reporting outcomes of fresh technologies as \\"impossible\\" is a bit like palm reading but missing, or ignoring, what has been reported for over a decade (and to build a book around it) is a sin authors like Fitzgerald should make every effort to avoid if they seek credibility.	2002-04-20

There are those of merit who endorse this book, such as the Dalai Lama and those not so meritorious - Larry King, Shirley MacLaine and Uri Geller (famous for his failed \\"powers\\" to make spoons melt between his fingers on  the Johnny Carson show, when his rigged spoons had been replaced with those  straight from the kitchen). Deepak uses a number of \\"seven level\\"  descriptions applying to a wide variety of things, from seven stages of  God, to characteristics of the brain, to seven kinds of satisfaction.  Finding satisfaction somehow \\"proves\\" the existence of God, though it's not  clear how. His propensity for claims out of blue sky without support is  relentless. The comparison of brain to God reads like a horoscope. One  could make whatever comparison they might want between brain and God and it  would have fit nicely here. Say, the brain of sleep and awareness is akin  to the God of knowing and the God who allows free will. His God is a  popularly pleasant one as he does not include a jealous or horrific God,  nor a God of plague and pestilence. <br />Since his first big seller he has  learned nothing more of quantum mechanics. He confuses the probabilistic  nature of the micro, quantum domain with the macro world to service his  evidence for God as the power that could pull off such tricks as blinking  the universe in and out of existence in a virtual world. He misrepresents  quantum mechanics as having revealed everything from telepathy and  clairvoyance to split personalities. His book brims with buzzwords from the  vocabulary of physics such as \\"space time continuum\\". Notice no physicists  endorsed his book. <br />He makes use of a current fad in angels by noting a  story of a blind priest who, about to collide with two bicyclists, is saved  by an angel. We are told despite the fact such events continue to be  catalogued we still doubt them. Is this surprising? Volumes of UFO  sightings, alien abductions, hauntings and crop circles are \\"catalogued\\".  Do we believe those too? <br />He preys on the scientifically illiterate and  religiously eager. If you want a serious coverage of this interesting topic  see John Polkinghorne - an Oxford physicist and Anglican Priest or the  likes of Teilhard de Chardin, a Jesuit Priest and biologist. If you want to  contribute to Deepak's Southern California mansion, buy his book.	2000-07-17

Unfortunately he descends into scholarly ambiguity in his chapter on the human mind, with bloated sentences that run on and can easily confuse even the careful reader. <br />The ultimate purpose of the book is to present allowance for belief in a divine creator. Mostly this revolves around the Anthropic Principle (AP) - the idea that the existence of life is so sensitive to variation in physical constants of the universe that they must have been set by a creator for such life to exist. AP embraces evolution as the machinery for God's work. Polkinghorne is in a minority among physicists but the idea should cause some pause for reflection. He limits credit to the idea that since we are products of those constants it should not be surprising that they are what they are. As one who appreciates the power of science he understandably holds dear any notion based on reason that allows for God. But he appears to hold the idea too dearly, as adherents of AP often do. Attempting to make apparent improbabilities of constants set by chance understandable he notes Leslie's philosophical story of a fly hit by a bullet on a vast wall. He allows it two possible reasons for occurring, 1) because very many bullets were fired or 2) because a marksman took careful aim. Thus with intent, as a creator would have for tuning the constants with the aim of creating humans. Surely he knows but ignores two other possibilities, that the fly and bullet just happened to be at the same place in time or that the fly and bullet have some as yet undiscovered attraction for one another requiring they meet. This last is analogous to the constants having the values they do for as yet undiscovered requirements within the fabric of the Big Bang or Inflation or some other mechanism. Probabilities against events can sometimes carry too much weight. The probability that any four hands of thirteen cards are drawn in specific order from a deck of fifty-two is 1 in 4 billion trillion. Yet each time you draw four hands of thirteen cards, it happens. The cards dealt are completely determined by their position in the deck. We don't know what that is but it is fixed. Polkinghorne makes a few similar, but generally lesser transgressions to preserve his belief. I was repeatedly surprised and relieved to see him admit this on occasion and discuss opposing views.<br />The only unfortunate result of such a book will be that creationists use such material against science through misunderstanding and convenient abbreviation. Which is not a reason to stop such inquiry. I recommend \\"Beyond Science\\" for those at least mildly aquatinted with the field.	1998-05-07
