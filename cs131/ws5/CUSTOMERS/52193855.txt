In this version, Martin explains that certain photos were given to him to use in the book only, and that other photos couldn't be given away on a CD. Given that he works with models and model agencies, who are out to maximize their income, this is understandable.<br /><br />The other thing is the only problem I have with this book -  for a dual-platform book, it's Mac-biased. That's not that it says that the Mac is a wonderful computer so much as Martin is so used to using one he doesn't have much idea of what Windows and Windows machines do.<br /><br />Near the beginning of the book, he shows the Photoshop workspace, and this is done using a Mac screenshot with the menu bar at the top of the screen (there's only one menu bar on the Mac, and it's always at the active window) along with a picture of the dock along the bottom of the window.<br /><br />Windows users, who are used to application windows holding only application data, will be confused at this. A brief note in the caption would have cleared things up, so that Windows users wouldn't expect to see the dock or other system images there. (Think of the dock as a version of the Windows taskbar, with icons rather than descriptions).<br /><br />There are other remarks that show in the earlier chapters, like talking about \\"UNIX-based operating systems like OS X and XP,\\" but XP isn't based on UNIX. There's no obvious misleading going on, nor is he using the book as a pulpit to push the Mac, but it could have done with a quick read from a Windows user who could have clarified these things.<br /><br />Otherwise it's great, and as you get into the details of the program the platform doesn't matter. This is not a beginner's book. I've used Photoshop for over ten years and this is written at my level.<br /><br />The quality of the book's production, with clear color photographs, makes it a much better proposition that those books with a few color images bound into the center. And the advice offered comes from someone who has worked under deadline to get images out.<br /><br />If you're skilled at Photoshop, you really need to look at this book.

The first one, in fact probably the only one, is that he's just NOT FUNNY.<br /><br />If you want a second one, the most important word in the English Language is not one character long, usually expressed in upper case, and is the character that appears between H and J in the alphabet.<br /><br />And here's one that might save people some money - if you see a neat technique in advertising, it is a good idea to remember it (cut out the page, if necessary) and try to reproduce it yourself. There are a number of \\"Down and Dirty tips\\" like this - the one I recall is the one using a watch.<br /><br />In fact, the tips here are more Up and Clean than Down and Dirty. If you want your Photoshop work to be slightly more interesting (but not too interesting), this is the book for you.<br /><br />This book bears all the hallmarks of a book done by several authors, none of which had too much interest in it. I don't know whether Mr. Kelby contributed every word in this book, but there are parts with altogether too much sophomore humor (and I'm doing it a favor rating it that high), along with mildly interesting techniques. The humor is something that was passe at the time of DOS for Dummies, and the only reason that I give this two stars is that someone can use the techniques.<br /><br />However, the techniques shown are yawn-inspiring. There's little or nothing that will blow your socks off, and this book comes a long way behind the Elements One-Click Wow! book.<br /><br />According to the blurb, this book shows you \\"Photoshop Element 3's most closely guarded special effects.\\" If you think about this for a minute, why would Adobe want to guard the special effects you can make with its program? And why would Scott Kelby need to have the words in the title \\"Voices that Matter\\"?<br /><br />If a book can't stand on its own merits, why should it need to be bumped up? And why can't the author put over his points without obscuring them with unfunny remarks?<br /><br />Look elsewhere. This book is for the Windows version only (not that I care that much, because I use Windows). There are plenty of better books on Photoshop Elements techniques.le \\"Voices that Matter\\"? <br /> <br />If a book can't stand on its own merits, why should it need to be bumped up?

My wife is a book editor and although the book doesn't cover this particular career, we went over her experiences and created a way to talk about them.<br /><br />Unless you were a corporate drone who never though outside the box (or even much inside it) you can point out the ways where you added a little extra to the way you did the job. If you can't think of such remarks you're just appear to be a faceless job applicant who has no worthwhile features, no matter what your real experiences.<br /><br />The way to use this book is to read all the examples, and especially take note of the best and second-best way of giving an answer. Eventually you'll learn what to say for any interview.<br /><br />I'd rather not have to say something like \\"Oh yes, I always worked hard at my last job\\" (which is not 100 percent true and sounds phoney). I'd rather use the behavioral technique and say that a co-worker went in on a Saturday to make up a couple of hours, found that a huge amount of work had been dumped on us, and split the work by e-mailing half of it to me at home, which took up most of my time on that weekend (which actually was true).<br /><br />I know which one would impress an employer.	2005-07-14

(3rd Edition)	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Extend Elements with One-Click Wow effects	When Adobe introduced Photoshop Elements it had a low-end program for newcomers to digital photography. It based the cut-down Elements program on its expensive and complex main Photoshop program. However, when you buy Elements you are actually installing quite a lot of the main program (even though no menu commands exist to use new features), and people have been finding ways to exploit the advanced features of Photoshop that Adobe thought would be too complex for Elements users.<br /><br />Several web sites and two books supply software to advance the capabilities of Elements. One book lets you use some of the professional-level features of the main program, and the other provides some wild effects. That book is the One-Click Wow book I'm reviewing here (the other one is Richard Lynch's The Hidden Powers of Photoshop Elements).<br /><br />Years ago I wrote a book on Photoshop version 3, and even without enhancements Photoshop Elements 3 is close to being equal to it. The effects in One-Click Wow can be done in several steps in the Main Photoshop program, and in fact that's how they're produced. Unfortunately the effects are of the \\"take it or leave it\\" variety - there's no way of altering them - but luckily Jack Davis has produced effects that will appeal to most people.<br /><br />Because this is a \\"cheat\\" and not an officialy approved set of program extensions, you have to manually copy the extensions from the CD to your hard drive. If Elements is running you need to reboot, and then you'll find them listed in the menus for Layer Effects and other places.<br /><br />One set of extensions work on photographs, and as well as those allowing you to change the appearance of the whole photograph there are other effects that let you add frames or edges. There's a whole series of effects that allows you to change a photograph so that it looks like a painting.<br /><br />The major set of effects works on graphics and type. They'll change your designs and words to look like chrome or many kinds of natural materials, as well as plenty that look like neon signs. In fact there are several hundred effects, as well as extra brushes and patterns.<br /><br />It's easiest to see this product not so much as a book, but more like a software add-on with an instruction manual that gives examples of almost every effect - in full color. There's even a multi-page tutorial in using the effects which should explain all you need to know about how to use them.<br /><br />Davis has been producing the Photoshop Wow books of effects since the beginning of the main program, so the effects here will make a major difference to your pictures. What I've also noticed is the way Davis crops his pictures which is a tutorial in itself - he crops very tightly and you can see the improvement.<br /><br />So if you can see a copy of this book before you buy it, take a look because what you see is what you're going to get. For most people it's a no-brainer buy, especially since even if you had the main Photoshop program you'd have to do numerous activities on your pictures to equal what you get here.<br /><br />For the price, it's an amazing bargain for the extra powers you get. I have both this and The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements, and the two of them make Elements a much more powerful and worthwhile program.o look like chrome or many kinds of natural materials, as well as plenty that look like neon signs.

The Photoshop Elements book fits that need to a T.<br /><br />The numbered steps take you through each of the operations, and I've yet to find an error or omission in any Quickstart book I've read. The reason that this book doesn't get five stars is that Photoshop Elements is a difficult book to fit in the Quickstart format.<br /><br />In writing a dual-platform book, author Craig Hoeschen faces the problem that a large part of the program (the Windows Photo Organizer) only shows up in one version. It is possible to work without the Organizer, but most Windows users will adopt it, so then there's the problem of looking for what you consider the basics only to find they're in the last chapter of the book.<br /><br />Many programs need no explanation of how to use them in terms of what you need to do at the meta level - there aren't books such as How to Write a Novel in Microsoft Word. It's assumed that once the user learns the difference between the program and the traditional way of doing things (like MS Word versus the typewriter) then no more help is necessary.<br /><br />But Photoshop needs lots of project-based instruction, and although Craig Hoeschen makes a good stab in a chapter called Creative Techniques (and in many instances through the rest of the book), you really need another book to help with this (which is why I bought Jennifer Fulton's \\"Photoshop Elements 3 in a Snap\\"). Then I found the book to extend Photoshop Elements called \\"The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 3\\" (by Richard Lynch) which came with a CD that added many useful features to the program.<br /><br />So the Quickstart Guide can't deal with all your Photoshop queries. It will satisfy your needs for an easy-to-get-to guide for many program operations, but you'll need other books to get the most out of the program. All these books are good, but be warned that no single Photoshop Elements book will show all you need to know.are good, but be warned that no single Photoshop Elements book will show all you need to know.	2005-06-03

I bought this book after buying Photoshop Elements - before I bought Elements I had the Visual Quickstart Guide. That book is about the program, whereas this book is about using the program.<br /><br />In fact it has a hundred and ninety tasks, and all the ones I've looked at were clearly explained. The inside front cover lists these tasks, and each page has the task number listed at the top.<br /><br />I've known Photoshop since version 2.5 for Windows, and I actually wrote a book (long out of print, thank goodness) on version 3 for Mac. So I know a lot of the underlying ideas of the program, and I'll give full marks to the Fultons for the way they explain it at the level of the newcomer to image manipulation. In fact, I needed to know how the Image Organizer and Image Editor worked together, and the book had that as a task.<br /><br />I examined over half a dozen Elements books, and this one was the best as well as being the largest. It has many diagrams (with many pictures of the Fulton couples' terminally cute daughter, Katerina). In fact the only reason I didn't give it five stars was that the the black and white pictures didn't have enough contrast, and it's possible to miss details.<br /><br />I think anyone who looks for a book on Elements and passes over this one is doing themselves a disservice. Photoshop Elements has plenty of amazing and useful features to improve your photographs, not to mention a large part of the abilities of the main Photoshop program, and using it but not knowing how to achieve new things is a waste of your money. So get your money's worth with Photoshop Elements in a Snap.	2005-05-21

However, his work is largely on how to present information graphically in print. That's the first mistake of this book, and it's illustrated by Tufte's favorite infographic (not shown in this pamphlet) - the contemporary illustration showing the decimation of Napoleon's troops as they invaded Russia in 1812.<br /><br />While this is great way of illustrating a large number of figures, it just doesn't work in PowerPoint. And the reason is that in print, you can expect the reader to pore over one of your points at his own rate, whereas in a presentation you have to present bite-size pieces so that audiences can get the idea immediately.<br /><br />Presenters don't even get this basic idea, so don't expect PowerPoint presentations to be good. In fact, there's a cult of \\"bad is good enough,\\" which makes me wonder how many other facets of doing business would people admit to be \\"good enough.\\"<br /><br />Other \\"faults\\" of PowerPoint are shown here. The Gettysburg address as a PowerPoint presentation was manufactured as a joke, so it's hardly a damning indictment of the program. The authors of the NASA slides which downplayed dangers to the Space Shuttle could also have downplayed them in a written report, and probably did. At the meeting where the slides were shown numerous people had concerns, but they felt that any dangers were just brushed aside.<br /><br />Until you have a culture of doing better in presentations, no one will be happy. People have no idea how to present giving priority to the message and nothing but.<br /><br />Tufte says that presentations are bad, like no one else knew that. But most presenters are in companies that don't value good presentations and make no effort on finding out how to create them.<br /><br />Until that culture changes we will always have bad presentations and people complaining about them.	2005-04-27

He grew GM from a bunch of mechanical geniuses and seat-of-the-pants administrators to the biggest company in the world after World War two.<br /><br />However, the U.S. auto industry was at the peak of its powers and was about to begin the long slow (but inevitable) decline. And unfortunately you can see why. In 1964 autos wouldn't last more than a few years, and were sold on the basis of the annual model change. It truly was a seller's market, and you can see how the problems of today stem from the attitudes of that time.<br /><br />Sloan is at his best describing the period 1921-1929 when the industry fell into place. The thirties get little mention and the period after the war is treated as one long period with no developments.<br /><br />Sloan is glib when it comes to showing off the attitudes of management of that time. Because GM couldn't sell high-profit cars during the war but instead did defence work, this \\"proves\\" that wars do not benefit business. There are two chapters, one on labor relations (\\"how we kept the hourly paid workers' wages down\\"), and following that, on executive bonuses (\\"must be kept in place\\").<br /><br />It's a worthwhile read, but it's becoming more historical than instructional.	2005-04-25

In \\"The Tipping Point\\" he examined how small and apparently inconsequential incidents ensure the success or failure of campaigns to influence the public. In \\"Blink,\\" he shows how, on the basis of minimal evidence, skilled people can make correct decisions.<br /><br />Since both these ideas fly in the face of common sense, he has his detractors. However, in \\"Blink\\" he has many examples where his theories hold water. Perhaps the most important is the one about military games where one team was given huge amounts of information and proceeded to work from this database. However, the team suffered heavy losses from unexpected attacks, even though they had the means in place to find traces of the the preparations of attacks. In fact, the leader of the opposing team did not behave in the way the \\"rule book\\" said he would and thus deluded the other side, even with all their knowledge.<br /><br />It is one of the things that we pride ourselves on - the ability to make correct decisions using all the evidence - yet sometimes the gut reaction is correct over the best person to hire, and sometimes also the supporting evidence turns out to be false.<br /><br />Gladwell makes it clear that this method of arriving at decisions is not necessarily true for most people or for most of the time, yet he manages to have numerous examples of, for instance, cops not shooting a suspect who appears to be reaching for a gun. What appears to be a hostile act may or may not be accompanied by other signs that make the cop more likely to believe he's in danger.<br /><br />The most fascinating chapter in the book for me - \\"Seven Seconds in the Bronx\\" - cover a police shooting of a man reaching for his wallet, but interspersed with that is the method used by Paul Ekman, who looks for fleeting facial expressions and can also teach this to others. This would be worth a book on its own, but careful examination of slow-motion film shows people revealing their feelings for a split-second at a time - the signs that experienced people look for.<br /><br />I think that \\"Blink\\" will make you never view the world in the same way again.

At that point I was sold.<br /><br />It's very easy to open your mouth and say your message in a way that alienates people. Very few people can negotiate difficult communications, but this book will help them do this. The book shows you words, phrases and body language to use and to avoid.

In many cases you'll see the traps you can fall into.<br /><br />You need to use this book with a little thought, in that the circumstances are usually similar to what you have to deal with, but not identical.

I recently noticed a couple of people online saying how great this book was so I thought I'd try it.<br />What a waste.<br />This book was written in 1974, and boy, does it show it. Although the book is set around the 30th century for some reason people still have a fascination with the 20th century - the two human spaceships are called &quot;MacArthur&quot; and &quot;Lenin.&quot; I can't wait for the next U.S. atomic submarine launched to be called &quot;Ethelred the Unready&quot; or some other major figure of around AD 1000.<br />The characters are remarkably two-dimensional, especially the humans. The engineer is Scottish based, an hae tawks like he was back in the Heelands. Even in 1974 people who talked like that were the stuff of parody.<br />The aliens are the only worthwhile invention, but they're like the Star Trek parody plot about the planet that seems perfect but has a deep dark secret.<br />Of course the humans are just like us with only a couple of insterstellar travel devices to justify having lived another thousand years. Their morals and attitudes are exactly the same as ours - when you consider how very foreign we'd look to people from AD 1000 you'd wonder why there's been no development.<br />As it is there's already been enough changed in the last thirty years that the story already seems incredibly tired and rooted in out-of-date attitudes.<br />And that staple of boring SF books - the incredibly rich and powerful old guy who dresses plainly - makes an appearance near the end.<br />This might have made an impression on me when I first started reading SF, but that was back in the late 1950s. I can't see why people would enjoy it now.	2004-06-16

Very little of this book (only two items) is in the movie. This means you get an episodic book without the strong plot of the movie.<br />However, it remains rewarding reading. The writing is excellent; the characters are complex, and the detail (I presume) is correctly rendered. I'm no nautical history buff, but the parts of the ship that I didn't understand didn't get in the way of the story.<br />The character of Jack Aubrey is drawn very well. In spite of being a hero, he's shown as a man with self-doubt and sometimes (especially on land) not knowing how to behave. The same level of detail goes for Stephen Maturin, the ship's doctor and Aubrey's friend, who has a closer grasp on the ways of the world yet is hardly a sailor.<br />O'Brian puts you on a British frigate in the early 1800s. I felt that it was a very convincing picture that he painted. Although Master and Commander is not the book you expect (especially if your introduction was the movie), it kept my attention enough for me to try more of O'Brian's work.	2004-03-11

You'd think that facing these odds the world would be full of books on the reasons why and how to avoid them, but this is the first one I've seen.<br />As you read you'll be struck by his understanding of the people who set up business, and also by the clarity of his solution. Yes, to some degree it's an advertisment for his consulting services, but there's plenty of advice.<br />I feel that a local business I frequent is beginning to enter a period of decline, and I wish I knew the owner well enough to give him a copy.<br />Incidentally, I didn't notice any of the problems other reviewers have mentioned, and in one case the book went right over the head of of one.<br />I expect to re-read this book several times, and I'm looking at some of the other Gerber titles.	2004-02-28

Instead of book with a story that starts at the beginning and ends at the end of the campaign, this book condenses the &quot;story&quot; into a single 38-page chapter.<br />The remaining almost 500 pages deal with different aspects of the entire campaign. It includes sections on the terrain (almost all jungle), the armies, the tactics, and many other features of the South Pacific war. There are many reminiscences from those who fought, and occasionally a story of a specific campaign.<br />What this does is give you a far better picture than most books of what it was like to be there. Instead of talking about the &quot;harsh&quot; jungle or the &quot;relentless&quot; Japanese, you get a huge detailed picture of exactly what it was like - the smell of the jungle, and the tactics the Japanese used.<br />Interspersed with this are Bergerud's comments on the effectiveness of how each company waged war, the strengths of the weapons, and how unprepared all sides were for the terrain.<br />I finished this book with a far deeper understanding of these battles, and I'd be interested to see this approach applied to other military history books.	2004-02-16

Why?<br />I'm sick of books that promise you that with just a few easy tips you'll be a great presenter overnight. In many cases I wonder if those authors have ever given a presentation. &quot;What to say when . . .&quot; is clearly written by someone who's been in the trenches and who appreciates the fact that presentation skills need lots of work - and why you need to have ways out of the tricky situations. In many ways it's like being with a small group of top presenters swapping war stories round a dinner table; the attitude is just as important as the information.<br />Second, this book actually gives you hope that when something bad happens in your presentation you might well be able to recover the situation. When you hear of how experienced speakers saved the day you will stop reacting to setbacks with total panic and instead think &quot;How would the Walters deal with this?&quot;<br />From the presenter's point of view, the most important message in this book is almost lost in the introduction. In a sidebar by Nate Booth, he makes the point that we'd rather not know - that sooner or later, something unexpected IS going to happen to you. I see so many presenters adopting a formal and distant approach in the hope that everything will go well, and then collapsing when things don't go according to plan. If you accept that nothing is perfect, you'll be taking the first step to relaxing in front of your audience - and giving a much better presentation.<br />The book is also readable for amusement. There are many examples of how to use humor to defuse tricky situations, and of course many examples of accidents that in retrospect are hilarious. My favorite is the story of the guy who skipped down the aisle to receive an award for running a department with the longest accident-free record. The inevitable happened, of course - but in a way that's much funnier than you could imagine. What was that? Oh, you'll have to buy the book to find out.n you could imagine. What was that?

You might think that with the glowing reviews from famous people that this would be a useful book, but in fact the reviews aren't wrong - if you're a senator or a TV personality you'll find this book useful.<br />The rest of us can give it a miss.<br />Valenti may be a great speaker, but in terms of a book for everyone he offers little. You should remember your speech pretty much word for word. You should think of the cadence of how you'll deliver it. There really isn't much more, apart from long reminiscences about famous speeches and speakers. The book has a strange almost Victorian tone.<br />To misquote one of the reviews - this is a dispensible resource. Spend your money on one of the books that teaches you a lot.	2003-04-02

Books	5	18	18	N	N	Essential for anyone	While this book has a business focus, there are many techniques shown that can be used in all facets of life - in the family, with friends, or in organizations and sports teams. It's a huge (1000+) list of tips for various situations. How do you deal with someone who's not pulling their weight? You don't have to be a manager at work - you can have unresponsive kids, friends who take much more than they give, and committee members who are just along for the ride.<br />All the points are obvious, but in real life we forget, communicate badly, and then make a bad situation worse. This book has the sort of information that someone gives you when they say, &quot;In that situation I always do . . .&quot; and you could hit yourself for not thinking of it at the time. If you read and re-read this book you'll begin to have these ideas when you need them, not afterward.<br />The tip formula is excellent. Too many books try to put ideas across in ordinary text and become confusing and unclear. Each tip and its supporting text is complete. You won't be left wondering what the author meant.<br />I teach people to make presentations and there is plenty here I intend to pass along. My order is in for Booher's forthcoming &quot;Speak With Confidence,&quot; because if it's even half as good as this book, it will be invaluable.<br />One last thought. Think about the times you didn't communicate that well. Think about the stress, the bad relations with other people, and all the negative things that resulted. Now look at the price of this book. Isn't it worth that price just to communicate effectively one time, let alone all the times this book will save the day?	2002-12-25

The book shows how the industry evolved from Warner Brothers execs (in WB blazers) signing the Grateful Dead (and being scared to death of being given LSD) - to the CBS policy of the mid-eighties of taking acts that the company wanted to succeed and have them make a few low-selling albums and play live gigs so they would have more credibility with record buyers.<br />The execs were every bit as exotic as the artists they represented, and thought nothing about double-dipping their clients' earnings even though they were already assured of millions. I was astounded to learn that at the height of the Eagles' success they went out on tour and got NINETY-SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT of the receipts, leaving the venue with just two and half percent.<br />Essential reading for anyone interested in the music industry, especially people trying to break into the scene. Check your integrity at the door, because it will just be an impediment otherwise.	2002-12-23

The authors deal with a narrow interpretation of non-fiction. Think of it as the kind of books you see on the \\"new non-fiction\\" table at the bookstore - nothing specialist like business, travel, or cookery.<br />So, although I'd sworn off writing another book I thought I'd at least read it to find out what Rabiner and Fortunato have to offer. I'm still wondering, although I've been reduced to a slog.<br />Reading this book is like wandering through a forest at night. You don't know where you're going. Just keeping moving is hard work. You don't know what you might get, although every so often you get hints and occasionally the odd nugget. But all too often you think, \\"Why am I doing this? What's the point?\\"<br />I don't know what the writing style is meant to demonstrate. Maybe that you don't need a manuscript editor? Is it meant to impress the amateur writer market, or to give you the impression that you're overhearing an acquisitions editor advising an author? Whatever the reason, it's tough sledding.<br />For instance, take the introduction. No, sorry, it's the prolog. It's a story that you're sure will lead to some basic truth about non-fiction writing, something that will stay with you all your writing life. The stage is set: \\"When I was editorial director of Basic Books . . . I went to a lunch meeting with buyers from [a big retail bookselling chain] . . . blah blah blah . . . those were my thoughts that day as the three of us arrived at [bookseller's] offices.\\" The excitement is palpable.<br />But after ten pages of this, here's the moral of that story: In big retail booksellers, books are often shelved in one area only, which may not be the most appropriate. So far as I can tell there's not much of an effort to show authors how to avoid this. I was ready for some big deep thought, but instead I got a little dance about how authors don't know enough to write saleable books. No wonder the last sentence of the introduction is: \\"For those of you still interested, let's begin.\\"<br />If you ignore this early warning you'll find that the vines begin to cling to your ankles. I'll admit I skim books, but I lost track of the number of times I missed a negative in the middle of a convoluted sentence, so I read things like \\"After due consideration, and taking all things on the one hand and then taking them on the other, it is usually but not always not necessary to do X\\" which I read as \\"It's necessary to do X.\\" It's my example sentence, but the actual sentences in the book are equally confused.<br />What is annoying is that there are many useful pieces of advice buried in this impenetrable prose. Probably after four or five readings you can unearth them all, but who would want to read this book more than once?<br />Here's my advice. Get this book. Get two highlighters of different colors (let's say red and yellow). Every time you come to some sentence that you think is very difficult to read, mark it in red. Every time you come to some particularly good advice, mark it in yellow. Buy a second red marker if need be. At the end of your ordeal you'll have a book that is almost completely red...sted, let's begin.\\"<br />If you ignore this early warning you'll find that the vines begin to cling to your ankles.

With this book  he's done some of his best work.<br />If you've ever created publications or  web sites you'll know how hard it is to remember to take into account  things that afterward seem so obvious. You learn the hard way that  nothing's obvious until you do it the wrong way.<br />The beauty of this book  is that you could read it through and never realize how many pitfalls  you've avoided by following Roger's advice.<br />The last few years have been  full of stories about how new companies, relying on the Internet, have  upset the giants and reshaped the landscape. Roger shows how small to  medium sized businesses can do the same thing. This doesn't involve big  budgets or time-consuming processes.<br />After you read this book I'm sure  you'll want to send a copy to many web sites. It seems that people have  gone out of their way to make their sites uninviting, incomplete, or just  plain confusing - and that means lost sales, not just once, but many times  if a potential customer goes to a competitor.<br />This book lays out a clear  plan of how your business can profit through the Internet. Roger's  immensely readable style guides you through the process with examples from  many different types of business. Just like the early days of the Internet  decided the big winners and losers, so relationship marketing will do the  same for smaller companies - and it's starting now.<br />A classic.	2000-08-03

You're supposed to practice, practice, practice. You learn chord shapes. You have lessons. You dissect solos note by note. There appears to be no master plan. Somehow, through a variety of  methods, you're supposed to learn. Eventually, you're assured, by some  means you're not aware of yet (osmosis?), you'll &quot;get it.&quot;<br />This  book is the &quot;it&quot; you're supposed to get.<br />Far too many books  assume that the common methods work. Many an aspiring student has put the  guitar in the closet in frustration at something that doesn't address the  basic question - What note do I play next?<br />Bill Edwards has taken the  idea of positional relationships to its highest point. If I play a C chord  with a barre at the eighth fret, where will I find a convenient F and G  position? What shape will I need to play, and what fret should I start  from?<br />This seems to me to be a basic question yet it hardly gets a  mention in most books. It seems that if you practice long enough and don't  get bored to death, you'll know this.<br />Bill Edwards shows that the five  major chord shapes (C, A, G, E, and D) follow as you move up the fretboard,  so you quickly learn that if you're playing a certain shape at a certain  fret, the chords you're going to need will be in a specific other shape a  specific number of frets away.<br />This is independent of what key you're  playing in, so if you start a 12-bar blues with a A-shape, you can drop  down a couple of frets and play an E-shape for the next chord.<br />I've made  it sound far more complex than it is. You'll need the book - make no  mistake - and in just a few hours you'll have learned a huge amount of  useful stuff.<br />But this is just the first seventeen of over a hundred  pages. The idea of positional relationships is used to describe scales and  then the pentatonic blues scale, so you can build solos and know  immediately where the next notes are.<br />Fretboard Logic pulls all the  useful stuff from other learning methods together. It shows you *why* you  play the notes you do.<br />I was suspicious of the other reviews here (mainly  reprinted from the book's cover), because they sounded so good they  couldn't be true. Then I saw the book recommended on the Fender Forum, so I  decided to take a chance.<br />Yeah, you still have to practice. Your fingers  won't get supple until you do. But imagine practicing where you're  constantly trying something new, and where the musical inspiration flows.

I started reading and  quickly found that these books moved too far, too fast - the same  experience that the others had.<br />I took a look at the UML books in my  local computer bookstore and decided to take a chance with this one. I'm  glad I did. If you don't have a heavy Computer Science background, you'll  find this to be an excellent introduction to UML.<br />Schmuller provides a  general introduction, followed by examples of all the main types of  diagrams. He follows this up with a case study of automating a restaurant.  In every instance the author constantly provides examples from the real  world, so it's almost impossible to fail to understand.<br />Schmuller's  writing style is great; his background in magazines shows off here, as  opposed to the &quot;scholars writing for other scholars&quot; approach of  many of the other UML books. The &quot;Twenty-four Hours&quot; format puts  the information into bite-size pieces, so you're never overwhelmed with new  facts.<br />People with a heavy computer science background will probably find  this book doesn't go into enough detail, but the rest of us will be very  happy. I'd suggest that if you had a small amount of programming experience  you'd be ideal for this book, but anyone who's had some experience of  computers can get a lot out of it.<br />After I read this book I came back to  the Three Amigos books and suddenly found I could understand them. In fact,  I could dip into the books at pretty much any point and follow what was  happening.<br />With my new-found knowledge I offered to teach an intoductory  course on UML for the people who were struggling with the Three Amigos  books, and as I created my outline I realized how well thought-out  Schmuller's book is. I didn't have to add much to what he'd written, and I  began to realize that his examples must have been carefully chosen to make  things very clear.<br />In short - if UML seems like a hard slog to you, or  you just think you need a passing knowledge, get this book. If you find  that you want to go further, you'll now have the kind of knowledge that the  Three Amigos expect from their readers.n, and I  began to realize that his examples must have been carefully chosen to make  things very clear.<br />In short - if UML seems like a hard slog to you, or  you just think you need a passing knowledge, get this book.
