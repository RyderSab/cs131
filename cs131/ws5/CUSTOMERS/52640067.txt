The house may be haunted, but if so, the ghost is very gentle and just a side delight to the story.  The house is almost a character in itself, beloved by its caretaker, Mrs. Warmer, and Bel who, with her new husband, helps to rescue Fletcher's End from the years its naval owner refused to spend a penny on its maintenance.<br />Besides Bel, we have her friend, the beautiful and nice Louise, who can't help having men falling in love with her, and a few of her beaus.  Should Louise choose Reggie, the serious one?  Alec the handsome and rich playboy? Roy, the also handsome former owner of Fletcher's End who's always broke?   <br />There are other characters whom we meet who don't really have anything to do with the early months of Bel's marriage or Louise's love life, but who are nonetheless interesting, such as the chimney sweep, the old gardener, and the inexperienced Mr. James, the youngest partner in Bel's husband's firm.  I enjoyed former secretary Bel teaching Mr. James a few of the ins and outs of office politics.<br />Yes, there are some unpleasant characters who manage to cause trouble and a couple of crises, but on the whole this is a nice little novel about good people, a good house, and love.  I recommend it for one of those grey days, outer or inner weather, where you feel the need to curl up and escape.	2004-03-03

Philip Tan did the art except for the prologue, which was drawn by Sean Phillips, and the conclusion,which was drawn by Takeshi Miyazawa.  I'm willing to give the writing a star because there were scenes I liked, but as for Mr. Tan's art...  Aside from Mr. Tan's cross-hatching making characters look as if they fought some cats and the cats won, the rough look of many panels, and what appear to be a lot of little ink splatters, there are too many panels where I couldn't quite make out what I was supposed to be seeing.  Mr. Miyazawa's nice, clear art comes as a relief.<br />The prologue is about Mystique and how she came to be Kurt's mother.  It's not a happy story.  Then we return to the Xavier Institute in the present.  The main story involves Nightcrawler and the secret of La Isle des Demonas.  Yes, that's the island that Alex, Lorna, and Kurt visited in UNCANNY X-MEN:  HOLY WAR.  I'm not going to bother to complain about possible continuity problems with Mystique, because if you don't read her comic, you won't notice.  The main story is almost as idiotic as the \\"Holy War\\" storyline.  Given what our guest villain, Azazel, claims, he and his people should have been from Mesopotamia, not off the coast of Florida.  They're evil nasty types who enjoy murder and torture.  Cringe for the X-Men who face them, for they mostly act as if they were the idiots who run into Lovecraft's Evil Old Recluses instead of sensible superheroes.  (On the other hand, it's fitting that Iceman gets the cover of this book because of the interesting way he turns the tables on one of Azazel's minions.)<br />There are no good fathers in this book if you don't count Professor Xavier, father figure to the X-Men.  Azazel has no right to expect any Father's Day cards from his sons.  If what Lorna tells us about Magneto is true, shame on him.  Remember young Sammy Pare from UXM:  HOPE, UXM:  DOMINANT SPECIES, and UXM:  HOLY WAR?  His dad has no hope of winning Father of the Year, either.  Unfortunately, the plot thread about the father of young Carter, son to school nurse Annie Ghazikhanian, gets dropped.<br />Archangel, Havok, Husk, Iceman, Jubilee, Nightcrawler, and Wolverine are the X-Men who handle the Azazel plot.  Fans of Abyss will get to meet him again.  Xavier and Annie are present as we learn why Polaris has been so nasty lately.  Mr. Xorn gets a cameo in that subplot.  Juggernaut and Northstar get the Sammy subplot, which includes a few members of Alpha Flight.  We even get to briefly meet the kitchen staff at Xavier's.  I liked their scene. I also liked Juggernaut and Northstar's verbal sparring on their way to Vancouver.  There's a scene between Kurt and Xavier that's rather sweet.  For me, the book's highlight has nothing to do with the very ineptly written \\"Draco\\" storyline.  It's a big argument between Xavier and Juggernaut where they actually talk [shout] about the roots of their former enmity.  There's a revelation or two that fans of the stepbrothers will not want to miss.<br />Fans of really bad stories or atrocious art will want to add DRACO to their collection.  For the rest, the only reason to buy this book is its resolution of several subplots.  Be prepared to grit your teeth a lot.of winning Father of the Year, either.

Besides lovely Cho-Cho-San, there's a gentleman theatre cat named Garrick.  The other delight is that Trixie and Evangeline, the former Hollywood Golden Age movie stars from REEL MURDER, ENCORE MURDER, and BREAK A LEG, DARLINGS!; are back.  <br />Overbearing and obnoxious characters abound, not least Evageline herself.  Loved the idea she came up with to cure one actor's lackluster performance, though.  There're interesting recipes that are being tested for a cookbook for people on the road, such as how to make a nicely poached egg when you don't have a egg poacher with you.  Pity the cookbook is on a tight deadline and the recipe tester is stuck with the suspects.  Will it be safe to eat anything in THAT kitchen?<br />The strength of this book is in its wickedly diverting dialog, to use an old phrase.  If you're in the mood to put up your feet and spend a cozy afternoon chortling (while giving thanks that Trixie has to deal with those people instead of you), I recommend this book.	2004-02-04
US	52640067	R23JCQGWPZYZWN	0312965133	446542332	Paws For Alarm (Dead Letter Mysteries)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	PAWS FOR ALARM is a reprint of DEATH SWAP [1984]	It's the companion volume to WHISKERS AND SMOKE [original title:  A TRAIL OF ASHES].  The Harper family of New Hampshire has swapped houses with an English widow, Rosemary, for the summer.  Nancy Harper has reason to be grumpy.  Her scholarly husband, Arnold, is too eager to get down to research in London.  Her twins come from the Calvin of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; mold.  Certainly she loves her husband and children, as can be seen during those times she fears she's lost them, even though they do their best to drive her crazy.<br />Arnold can be a dreadful tease, but is that any reason for his series of near-fatal accidents?  Was Rosemary's husband's death an accident after all?  Can the Harpers find out what's going on before Arnold has his final &quot;accident&quot;?  How many letters telling Rosemary what damages those Harper imps have caused is poor Nancy going to have to write?  If only Donald and Donna could be as polite and well-behaved as Esmond, Rosemary's cat.<br />Yes, you will find those Babson scenes of awkward social situations in this book.  (What do you say when you find an acquaintance caught doing what One Should Not Be Doing?  How do you keep your cool when your Loved Ones -- and you're using the term very loosely at the moment -- are making a bid to totally gross you out in public?)  Ms. Babson has written better stories, but this one is still a pretty good read.	2004-01-27
US	52640067	R1ZTRKUOQJNUSL	0802731759	645970668	Death Swap	Books	3	6	6	N	N	DEATH SWAP is the original title of PAWS FOR ALARM	I'll bet the reason the reprint has the title change and a cat featured on the cover is that Ms. Babson has several popular books featuring cats.  There is a very nice cat named Esmond, but he doesn't have a big role.  The swap in the title refers to a house swap.  The adventures of the English family in the American house for the summer may be read in the first book, A TRAIL OF ASHES (reprint title:  WHISKERS AND SMOKE).  The American family's name is Harper.  Nancy Harper, the mother, is our narrator.  She has twin children who obviously come from the same mold as Calvin of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; fame.  The husband in the English family was recently killed in a car accident.  Or was it an accident?  Nancy's husband, Arnold, soon starts having a series of near-fatal accidents.  Why would anyone want to kill Arnold?	2004-01-27

It picks up where NEW X-MEN: RIOT AT XAVIER'S left off.  Jean gives Emma Frost a Very Hard Time indeed (although not as hard as she could have, given the situation).  In the process, we learn about Emma's origin.<br />Bishop and Sage come to investigate the murder.  The faculty and students are all suspect.  Bishop makes reference to what happened to him (and Sage) when they were at the Institute the previous winter [see X-TREME X-MEN: SCHISM].  As in NEW X-MEN:  NEW WORLDS, Mr. Morrison shows more respect to his guest stars than Mr. Claremont did in SCHISM.  Prof. X's method of assuring Bishop that he is not an impostor or possessed made me smile.  I laughed aloud at Basilisk's declaration for the game of \\"Clue\\" he and the Beak were playing when Bishop enters Mr. Xorn's classroom.  The prisoner Bishop visits in a jail does not support SCHISM's suggestion that the main X-Men believe that mutants are above the law.<br />We get a confession!  Is it real?  What's in the shack out back?  What secret is the Beak so frantic to hide?  Can you spot the killer?<br />The \\"Assault on Weapon Plus\\" section [art by Bachalo], gets a rousing start that makes me chortle with delight whenever I reread it.  Scott is at the Hellfire Club.  I found his reply to a gorgeous dancer quite funny.  Even funnier is Scott's conversation with Sabretooth.  Suave Sebastian Shaw's appearance is not dull.  His opinion of Scott's drink is more elegantly worded than Sabretooth's, but no more flattering.  I'm not a big fan of Mr. Bachalo's art in general, but he was perfect for the Hellfire Club scenes.  The guys' expressions are great.  I loved Wolverine's invitation to Scott, his men's room conversation with Sabretooth, and his advice concerning Scott's problem.  Wolverine's expression at the end of this section cracks me up.<br />Unfortunately, \\"Assault on Weapon Plus\\" went downhill after part one.  If you like explosions and slugfests, you'll probably have more fun with Cyclops', Wolverine's, and Fantomex's adventures in parts two through four than I did.  I did enjoy Cyclops' nice speech about Wolverine, as well as his order to Fantomex and Fantomex's response in part three.  From part four I also liked Cyclops' reason why he and Wolverine should remove their x-jackets, the man who may or may not be Fantomex's boss telling him why they're disappointed in him, and Wolverine's first response when he's asked the purpose of life.  <br />\\"Murder at the Mansion\\" and part one of \\"Assault on Weapon Plus\\" get a big \\"thumbs up\\" from me.  Parts two and three have good spots.  More importantly, you'll want this book (and E IS FOR EXTINCTION, IMPERIAL, NEW WORLDS, and RIOT AT XAVIER's -- or NEW X-MEN HARDCOVERS one and two) when the PLANET X volume comes out.  I, for one, am extremely impressed with Mr. Morrison's long-range planning, careful planting of clues, and going back to what appeared to be mere throw-away lines in the earlier volumes.	2004-01-07
US	52640067	R2LG8AGB5GQ445	0785111336	194214597	Uncanny X-Men Volume 3: Holy War TPB	Books	3	11	11	N	N	There Are Several Storylines in this Book	Their titles in the original issues were \\"Rules of Engagement\\" [421-422], \\"Holy War\\" [423-424], \\"Sacred Vows\\" [425-426], and \\"The Dead Have No Rights\\" [427].  The Lorna-Alex-Annie triangle takes up more of the book than anything else, so I guess \\"Holy War\\" made the title because its issues were the only ones with Wolverine on the cover.  It certainly isn't the best story.<br />My preference is for the ongoing reformation of the Juggernaut subplot [see UNCANNY X-MEN:  HOPE and UXM:  DOMINANT SPECIES].  Cain Marko takes a big step in the opening story.  I know from early back issues that Professor Xavier has long wished that he and his stepbrother could truly be brothers.  Their scene together has a really nice ending.  I'm happy for both of them.     <br />Alpha Flight was at a disadvantage in their fight with the X-Men.  I think on some level they figured out that their deal with the Governor of New York wasn't as clean as they thought.  (The Governor wants to use the riot [see NEW X-MEN:  RIOT AT XAVIER'S] to shut down the school.)  Unfortunately for Alpha Flight and the cops, the Juggernaut is an extremely loyal friend -- and he considers some of the people at Xavier's to be his friends.  (Can you say, I sure hope Prof. X has his checkbook handy?  I thought you could.)<br />Speaking of Prof. X, Sage has suggested that Xavier, Jean, and Emma are too powerful to be trusted [see X-TREME X-MEN: SCHISM].  Perhaps that's why Prof. X doesn't use his telepathy at all during this crisis.  Instead, he spends most of it on the phone with his lawyer.  (At one point, the tone of X's politely understated request to Mr. White reminded me of CPT Kirk's famous suggestion when he's about to be sucked into the Doomsday Machine.)  <br />Because I'm Catholic, I expected to be deeply offended by \\"Holy War\\".  I found myself laughing instead.  Besides the \\"The Rapture\\" error, Mr. Austen has Catholic characters quoting from THE NEW REVISED STANDARD VERSION BIBLE, which is Protestant.  TheChurch of Humanity's discarded plan, which involved Nightcrawler, demonstrates no understanding of how our Pope gets elected.  (Not to mention that it would have been more likely that people would have recognized Nightcrawler and wondered what the X-Men were doing than to have had the effect the C of H wanted).  The facts that Mr. Austen needed are readily available on the Internet, so there's no excuse for his lack of research.  <BR>Not even the aftermath of a sickening attack on the school at \\"Holy War's\\" beginning can save it from being the stupidest story in the book.<br />The runnerup for that title is \\"Sacred Vows\\".  Even though there's no indication that Cyclops told Prof. X about the way Lorna was acting in \\"Holy War\\", her behavior in NEW X-MEN:  NEW WORLDS and UNCANNY X-MEN:  DOMINANT SPECIES should have made Xavier suspect that Lorna might need therapy before getting married.  Alex's spectacularly bad timing didn't help.<br />Except for the very unsubtle last panel, \\"The Dead Have No Rights\\" is a pretty good story.  Jubilee has to deal with a bigoted cemetery manager while Husk guards their late mutant friend's grave.  I'm assuming that the bigot believes that bodies must remain intact for the Resurrection of the Dead at the Second Coming of Christ.  Otherwise, his refusal to wait to see if Xavier will pay doesn't make sense.  Archangel gets to do a noble deed that I don't think was very wise, considering the way his power works.<br />Other bits of this book that I also liked were Lorna's wedding plans phone call with her mom, a joke about Kurt's tail, the bachelor and bachelorette parties, Cain and young Sammy's disagreement over who's the best-looking lady at Xavier's, Alex's kindness to Cain and Cain's repayment, Cain's reaction when Chamber and Husk have an argument while Husk is trying to unbury the big guy, and Cain's gentleness with Carter and Sammy.  Some fans might enjoy Stacy X's farewell video to Warren.<br />I'd recommend buying this book forthe Juggernaut reformation subplot.  If you enjoy reading jaw-droppingly stupid stories that you have to wonder how they ever got past an editor, you might want to buy it for \\"Holy War\\".  I'm a little surprised that Marvel allowed those issues to be reprinted without adding a page apologizing for that story's errors of fact as well as the implicit assumption that we Catholics are blithering idiots.	2004-01-07
US	52640067	R2ATBSP8V63XS4	0785110844	317672398	X-Treme X-Men Volume 3: Schism TPB	Books	3	7	12	N	N	"Schism" collects issues 19-23 & X-Pose 1+2	In June 2003 I returned to reading X-Men comics after a 23-year absence.  I admired Mr. Claremont's work back then.  However, I can't admire an aspect of his current work.  So far as I can tell from the back issues I have of offshoot X-Men teams, \\"X-Treme X-Men\\" is the first that tries to make the main team seem morally lacking and the offshoot team the morally correct one.<br />The first issue gives us a party that includes some of the main X-Men and a funny joke about Storm and Khan from \\"Invasion\\". It has a few nods to then-future Morrison New X-Men plots (\\"Riot at Xavier's\\" and \\"Planet X\\").  However, it also contains a scene where Sage suggests (to Bishop) that Xavier, Jean, and Emma Frost working together could become too dangerous.  Sage repeats her reservations later in the book.  While the last issue of \\"Planet X\\" hasn't come out as I write this, the first four issues & \\"Riot at Xavier's\\" show Prof. X paying for his reluctance to rape minds for information. (Yes, Emma's attempted telepathic seduction of Cyclops was unethical, but Jean punishes her in \\"Assault on Weapon X Plus\\".)  As far as I'm concerned, Sage should be renamed \\"Fool\\" because she apparently hasn't tried to find out HOW Cassandra Nova was able to fool those powerful telepaths in NXM \\"E is for Extinction\\" and \\"Imperial\\".  Nor do we see her sit down with Xavier to discuss her concerns.                    <br />The two issues of \\"X-Pose\\" sandwiched between the pages reprinting issues 19 & 20 are about a planned TV documentary on the X-Men.  Mr. Claremont stacks the book in his team's favor  by having them meet the two ethical and polite reporters while other X-Men have to deal with the arrogant and rude ones.  Warren (Angel/Archangel) appesrs in X-Pose #2.  Mr. Claremont has Warren use a less ethical solution to the documentary problem than he could have, which makes the X-Corp look bad.  What he has Warren tell Storm about the X-Men is not supported by \\"New X-Men\\" (NXM) or \\"Uncanny X-Men\\" (UXM).It's not even supported by THIS book's end.  It bothers me that Storm doesn't wonder why Warren is being so cold and arrogant to her.  It bothers me that she doesn't point out to Warren that he doesn't have the authority to make the ultimatum he gives her.  Further, the X-Men are supposed to be family.  Storm could have called \\"Daddy\\" Xavier to tell him what \\"brother\\" Warren did and said and then handed the phone over to Warren.  Xavier's behavior when Storm finally calls him (about Emma) does not suggest that he would have blown her off.  Xavier's greeting, when they meet again in the flesh, should leave no reader in doubt of his affection for his \\"daughter\\".  Storm tells her team that Warren's right, the stakes are too high -- so why didn't she call?                                         <br />\\"X-Pose\\" brings up the problem of young mutants who have never  met Professor Xavier, let alone been trained by him, and who are perfectly happy to abuse regular humans with their powers.  We also meet a theme that will become important in \\"Schism\\":  mutants can get away with crimes because regular humans can't stop them.    According to \\"Schism\\", only Storm's splinter group cares about this problem.  The main X-Men are too concerned with mutant rights.  You need only read Morrison's NXM \\"Riot at Xavier's\\" and \\"Assault on Weapon X Plus\\" books to know that's ridiculous.  Reading NXM \\"New Worlds\\" shows that the other X-Men care about helping humans.  In Austen's UXM book, \\"Hope\\", Xavier hires a regular human as school nurse.<br />Our problem for \\"Schism\\" is a young mutant named Jeffrey who may or may not be a murderer.  Mr. Bogan, a very evil man, was apparently controlling Jeffrey before and may or may not have been able to control him while he was at Xavier's.  The climactic battle in the Danger Room may or may not have actually happened.  Xavier takes Storm's, Bishop's, and Sage's report seriously anyway.<br />Given what Sage told Storm about Bogan, Ororo acts like an idiot at the end. If you read this book, you might ask yourself why Mr. Claremont didn't have: Prof. X suggest that Jeffrey be tried within Xavier's for his own and the court's safety, OR Storm bother to consider that Jeffrey's horrific personal tragedy   probably left him unable to recognize innocents from foes during the fatal incident, OR Storm think that Jeffrey could atone by learning to use his power for rescue operations, OR Prof. X  answer Storm more effectively.  <br />On the lighter side, in the reprint of XTX #23, Ororo makes a remark that should amuse readers of NXM \\"New Worlds\\" [see the reprint of #132] and there's a mutant female lawyer who had better not have her power triggered by her own blood.  <br />I'd have given the book a higher rating if it didn't denigrate the main X-Men, particularly Warren, X, Jean, and Emma.  I think Mr. Claremont should have just had Storm's group remain separate because they're worried that the school and regional X-Corporations are too openly targets.	2003-12-02
US	52640067	R3K3U4VES2TFZ3	1588991954	255169331	Bride of Deimos, Vol. 1	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Nice to finally be able to properly read the pages!	I was introduced to the first volume of DEIMOS NO HANAYOME [Bride of Deimos] in 1983.  Since then I've acquired all the volumes through #17.  I've got the video, the record [a mixture of drama and song], and I've read fan translations of some of the stories.  Still, I was pleased to find out that there are English language volumes because my Japanese language skills have never been more than rudimentary.  I could make out the basics of the stories, but it's nice to get the details.<br />This volume does have all the stories from volume one:  1.  Minako meets her stalker, Deimos, and discovers he considers her to be his bride.  2.  Deimos' chosen victim is Minako's own cousin.  Is there anything that can be done to save Ryou?  3.  This one opens up on a boy locking his mother in the basement.  Now it's 5 years later and he's attracted to Minako.  Deimos warns her away from Natsuhiko.  Should she listen?  4.  Deimos says there's a frightening truth behind a familiar Japanese legend.  If this isn't one of his tricks, one of the teachers at Minako's school is in grave danger.  5.  Why are people developing a shadow in the shape of the Devil Lily of Ghost Fire Island on their bodies?  Now Minako is one of the victims and must seek the answer if she is ever to be cured.  6.  This is Deimos' origin.  It's not the same as the Greek/Roman myths, as you can tell from the back of the book.  Venus is tired of waiting to take over Minako's body.  She wants that body *now*!  7.  In this we meet a crying Noh mask.  Why does it cry?  Yes, it's another tragic love story.  8.  The disfigured racer and his blind beloved are the subject of the last tale and it shows what Deimos is willing to do to prove his point.<br />The copyright date is 1975.  Those fans familiar with Ms.Ashibe's art in &quot;Crystal Dragon&quot; will find this earlier work more &quot;cartoony&quot;, but it's still quite effective.            <br />That should be &quot;Ms.&quot;, not &quot;Mr.&quot; Tsukiko's Secret for the title of the third story.  [In the original, it's Tsukiko Sensei, &quot;Sensei&quot; being a suffix used with the surnames of teachers, doctors, scholars, etc.  My old grammar notes text says it implies more respect than &quot;san&quot;.  Also, the kanji used for her name are &quot;moon&quot; (tsuki) and &quot;child&quot; (ko).  <br />For the curious, I'll provide the meanings for the kanji in the little ovals on p. 177 are [starting from the tree and moving closer to elderly Mr. Kogorou].  I looked most of them up in my little READING AND WRITING JAPANESE book.  The others I had to find in my Nelson's JAPANESE-ENGLISH CHARACTER DICTIONARY:  &quot;E - To depend on&quot;, &quot;Han - generally; to carry, to turn; to enjoy&quot;,  &quot;Nya - if&quot; (I know the hiragana are &quot;ni ya,&quot; but Nelson's &quot;nya&quot;), &quot;Ha - wave [as in sea or ocean]&quot;, &quot;Ra - silk gauze, thin silk&quot;, &quot;Mitsu [not just &quot;mi&quot;, according to my Nelson's] - secrecy; denseness (of population); minuteness, carefulness, fineness&quot;, &quot;Ta - many, much, abundant&quot;, &quot;Ko - old, former times; reason&quot;, &quot;Toku - virtue, power of comanding love and respect&quot;, &quot;A - flatter, fawn upon&quot;.   <br />Personally, I think they should have used &quot;terror&quot;, the other meaning of Deimos, because it's more frightening than &quot;fear&quot;.<br />The pictorial cover is actually from volume 14.  The original dustjacket shows Minako from the hips up.  She's wearing a pink plouse with a frill around the collar and cuffs, and a red jumper (in the American sense of the word).  She's looking to the left and seems more puzzled than distressed.  The background is black except for a couple of bare, grey tree branches, and Deimos' face (colored a pale blue) and part of one of his horns (white).<BR>His eyes are green in this picture.  They're blue in later dustjackets. The back of my dustjacket has a gold oval with the face and hair of Venus (blue eyes, strawberry blond hair) and four versions of her butterfly form coming toward her, the last partially in front of her hair.  I'm pretty sure that the image on the back of this cover is on my record, but I'd have to finish moving some boxes that I have in front of the record player at the moment to get to it.	2003-09-09

I feel sorry for Stephanie's parents (must admit her mother bakes a mean bribe). I like Morelli and his family, so I didn't have a problem with having plenty of him in this book.  Joe &amp; Stephanie's dog, Bob, saw more action than Rex the hamster, but I doubt that Rex minded.  The trip to Vegas with Lula and Connie was the highlight of the book.  I can hardly wait to see how Ranger is going to pay Stephanie back for a trick she pulls on him.  Ranger's Merry Men probably wish that she'd gotten cars blown up as usual.  For me the only flaws in this entry are that the killer was much too easy to figure out and the lack of car destruction meant no Big Blue.  Bob and Boo, the other dog, while fun, were not adequate substitutes.	2003-09-09
US	52640067	R2Y52UMSXI8ZB5	0785110917	154597709	Ultimate X-Men Vol. 6: Return of The King	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Contains "Ultimate X-Men" issues 26-33  (Not Just for Kids)	I have the hardcover \\"Ultimate X-Men\\" volumes 1 and 2 [covering issues 1-25] and the paperback, \\"Ultimate War\\".  The title page includes a brief synopsis that should help you understand what's going on if you haven't read the earlier volumes.  If you want a roll call, this volume includes the \\"ultimate\\" line versions of Magneto, Professor X, Dr. Moira MacTaggert, Nick Fury, Sabretooth, Multiple Man, Mastermind, Nightcrawler, Forge, the Blob, Iceman, Colossus, Storm, Wolverine, Jean Grey, Cyclops, Shadowcat, Rogue, and a mutant called Detonator whom I have not run across in the regular Marvel X-Men, but I'm still catching up.  There's also a cameo by another mutant, but I don't want to spoil the surprise.  <br />This book opens by showing us how Magneto and Prof. X worked together, how their friendship deteriorated over several years, and, in more detail, how Magneto crippled Xavier.  Then it moves into the present day and Magneto's progress on his refuge for mutants as well as the unpleasant scene where he deals with plans for a satellite mutant tracker.  Meanwhile, the X-Men-in-hiding are dealing with Magneto's brotherhood in the hope of rehabilitating their image.<br />Is the rumor that Wolverine deliberately left Cyclops to die in the Savage Land true?<br />In the grand tradition of comic book villains, Magneto tells our heroes something of his frightful plan for eliminating the human-mutant relations problem.  The X-Men have only a week to find Magneto's hiding place and save the world.  (Let me just say that a machine, different from and much more powerful than the one used in the first X-Men movie, is involved.)  The final battle certainly kept my interest.<br />During most of the action, Professor X is being held prisoner in a S.H.I.E.L.D. detention camp for mutants suspected of being terrorists.  He refuses to betray his students, of course.  I reread his words of encouragement to a fellow prisoner after rereading earlier volumes and those words became a little unnerving near the end. Why?<br />Because of what Prof. X tells Nick Fury and what he tells Magneto when they meet again late in the book.  You won't have to have read the earlier volumes to speculate on whether or not Xavier is telling the truth. I'm afraid that he *is* telling the truth.  If so, that would explain a couple of his moves in earlier volumes that I found incredibly stupid -- and would make this version of Prof. X a little scary.    <BR>   <BR>Ignore the \\"9-12\\" age group recommendation.  While they might enjoy the action, I think you need to be older than that to fully appreciate this book.	2003-09-03

That way you won't be screaming about the differences from the regular comics.  If you've already read through volume 5, \\"Ultimate War\\", the opening does not pick up where that left off.  It traces the rise and fall of the partnership between Professor Xavier and Magneto for the first 20 pages or so.  <br />Magneto is getting ready to destroy the entire human race, except for a token man and woman.  The X-Men are in hiding, although they do make an attempt to rehabilitate their image and track down Magneto.  Prof. X has been moved to that detention unit for mutants in Cuba that was threatned in \\"Ultimate War\\".  Cyclops is not dead (was anyone expecting he would be?), but he's not in good condition.  Of course the X-Men will save the day, Prof. X will escape, and Magneto will be foiled, but there'll be plenty of fighting, explosions, and a threatened nuclear meltdown.<br />Loved the part where Storm meets the Beast's parents, not to mention having my suspicion about Xavier's cat confirmed.    <br />The final scene between Xavier and Magneto is my favorite part of the book.	2003-08-29

This is a illustrated novelization of the comics, not a reprint of the comics themselves.  Because I still haven't seen the comics, I don't know how well this version compares to the original.

I'd already been warned that the \\"Ultimate\\" version was much more cynical & nasty than the original version, but this volume reprinting \\"Ultimate War\\" 1-4 had some nice panels of Prof. X in it, so I bought it anyway.  Nastier?  Oh, yes.  The implications of what Magneto does to Quicksilver made me cringe.  The body count after the destruction of the Brooklyn Bridge seemed horrifying enough -- wasn't too thrilled to learn it was little more than half of what the Brotherhood was aiming for.  Saw the X-2 movie with one of my sisters and she sneered afterwards that Prof. X should have killed Magneto in the 1st movie, but he's too much of a Goody Two-Shoes.  I repeated this to a friend and we had quite a discussion about it.  His position was that superheroes don't kill and there's no justification for killing Magneto on the basis that he *might* kill again.  I played Devil's Advocate and argued that by letting Magneto live, any subsequent murders Mr. Magnet commits would be partially Prof. X's responsibility.  This volume plays out that argument.  Prof. X lied and claimed he killed Magneto when he just brainwashed him.  Mistake?<br />This Magneto is proposing that the regular humans' fate will be either slavery, fuel, or food.  Charming.  Also stupid, since normal humans are still the biggest source of mutants.  <br />If you find the Magneto-Prof. X relationship fascinating, as I do, there are some pages here that should make the volume worth your while.  For all Magneto claims that Xavier is too far gone (in loving humans) to join the Brotherhood, he makes the \\"charismatic cripple\\" [his words, not mine], another offer at the end.  Magneto wondering aloud how Xavier maintains his \\"saint-like reputation\\" is sourly amusing since I've read that in this series, it was Magneto who paralyzed Xavier.  <br />My biggest objection to Xavier's portrayal in this volume is his overconfidence.  Unless he was planning a real trap within a fake trap, the good professor acts like a twit instead of a genius when he sets up the meeting with Magneto.  I'm not a genius and I knew better.  Stupid, stupid, stupid!       <br />Having Jean pick up on what Wolverine did about Scott was pretty good.  Iceman's talk with his father was bleak.  Liked the Wasp's little chat with Jean's dad.  The panels mentioning what the Hulk did when he escaped -- GAK!  The X-Men's complaint that the Ninja Assassin fight simulation kick-boxing sequence cross-references Hebrew ideology gets a cute payoff during the fight issue.  Oh, if you don't know what \\"Zyklon B\\" is, it was used to gas concentration camp victims to death during World War II.<br />If all you want is action, you'll probably be disappointed.  If you like characterization as well as action, pick it up.	2003-07-08

If you've ever moved away from a house you cared about and had a chance to see it later, only to find that it's been changed in ways you hate, you'll understand how Quill feels.  Marge Schmidt hasn't just changed the name to the Dew Drop Inn.  Quill is similarly taken aback by what's happened to the bar and the rose garden -- and there's reason to fear for the koi.<br />Each of the people who die in this book made a bad decision, but theirs proved fatal.  <br />I haven't read all the earlier books, so I don't know if Carol Ann Spinoza is a new character.  She's so nasty that first I worried about how her children were going to turn out -- then actively hoped her husband would be made a widower.<br />Yes, there are Chamber of Commerce meetings and yes, Quill is going to do some more of her doodles that I wish we could get to see.  (As usual, the persons captured in the doodles should be glad we can't.)    <br />Is romance in the air for Marge?  Will Quill's Myles disapprove of her meddling?  Can the cowboys & the potential investors mix?  Can Quill buy the inn back?  <br />This is a worthy entry in a good cozy series.  I would like to note, though, for the non-Nero Wolfe fans, that the mention of the great detective in chapter six has one of those errors that spell-check can't catch.

I didn't finish this one because I've read more reputable Ripper books (THE COMPLETE JACK THE RIPPER by Donald Rumbelow [1975] and THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF JACK THE RIPPER by Philip Sugden [revised 1995 edition]) than the one the authors read.  Their use of Stephen Knight's version became too aggravating for me.  I wish they'd done more research before writing this novel.<br />However, if you don't know much about Jack the Ripper, or you are more willing to overlook the plot than I am, you should find this an entertaining book.  I did care enough about the subplot involving the Sheridans' housekeeper to dip into the last chapters to see how that turned out.	2003-05-04

Her beautiful mother died when she was only two.  Her father is a famous film director.  Margaret has been in one boarding school after another because she keeps getting into trouble.  She hates her latest school and everyone there.<br />If Margaret thought her life stank like week-old gym socks, it gets worse in the first chapter.  Daddy is getting married again to a beautiful starlet named Kiki.  Kiki doesn't want to live in their old house with all the memories of Margaret's mother, so it's going to be sold.  Worse, Kiki doesn't think she can be a mother to a 12 year-old, so Margaret is being sent to Houston to live with her mother's mother for the summer.  <br />Margaret doesn't want to meet Kiki.  She's so upset that she can't get away fast enough even if she hasn't seen her Grandma since she was too young to remember her.<br />Grandma is nice and younger looking than Margaret expected.  Grandma is hoping they'll have a nice, quiet summer together, getting to know each other.  It doesn't work out that way, of course.<br />The first night, a neighbor and her two little kids come over because a guy with a gun is at their house.  They're staying with Grandma awhile.  The guy with the gun makes the news.  That brings Uncle Dennis with an enormous hairball on legs called Flowerpot [no joke] because he wants Grandma to be protected.  The \\"guard\\" dog turns out to be good for big, slobbery licks and tearing around the house.<br />Aunt Janet is all upset because her husband is very busy being a doctor and can't read her mind, so she uses the news as an excuse to come over with a burglar alarm and her two kids.  Now Margaret has to share her room with little cousin Debbie, who can hog a bed worse than a cat.  Her brother, Jason, is no angel either.<br />Aunt Sharon isn't upset with her husband, but she's worried about Grandma, too, so *she* comes to add to noise and crowding.<BR>The aunts and uncle want Grandma to sell her house and move into a secure apartment.  Grandma doesn't want to.  They won't listen.<br />Margaret isn't used to this.  She's got to get away.  One of the local radio stations is having a contest for a dream vacation at the beach.  Margaret buys over 200 post cards and fills them out to enter that contest.  Meanwhile, the jerk with gun is out on bail......	2003-03-08

The first is MAGGIE, TOO and the third is MAGGIE FOREVERMORE.  I checked all three books out of my local library yesterday and read them today.  I'm hoping that Ms. Nixon wrote more books about Maggie because I like her.<br />Maggie is 12, going on 13.  Her beautiful mother died when she was two.  Her movie director father has sent her to many boarding schools over the years because Maggie keeps getting into trouble.  In the first book, Maggie's father married a beautiful young woman only 8 years older than Maggie.  Kiki didn't think she could be a mother to Maggie, so Maggie was sent off to spend the summer with her mother's mother, Margaret Landry.  <br />This book opens with young Maggie still living with Grandma in Houston, Texas.  Her father and stepmother are in Europe.  School is starting and it's Maggie's first time in a public school.  She meets her friend, Lisa, and her sort-of enemy, Jerico, on the first day.  (Jerico thought he was one tough guy, but when he picks on Maggie, he soon finds out that she's no wimp.)<br />Maggie joins the Drama Club and finds that she enjoys it.  Her teacher was her mother's teacher, too, but Maggie doesn't tell Mrs. Finch that -- not even when Maggie and Lisa are trying out for the same part in the same play Maggie's mother was in when she was in school.  Maggie doesn't know if she wants to get the part or not.  Lisa is the first friend she's ever had.  Oh, well, there's also the Junior High School Musical Review if Lisa wins.<br />If Maggie gets a part in either one, will her father come to see her peform?  Maggie wants that so much she can taste it.  On the other hand, Jerico has promised her he's going to get back at her -- sometime -- and it's going to be good.  What has Jerico got in mind?  Should Maggie worry?<br />By the way in the first chapter we learn that Maggie spent sixth grade at Miss Haversham's School for Girls.  I think the author ishaving a little fun there because there's a famous character with that name in a book called GREAT EXPECTATIONS.  Miss Haversham's fiance left her at the altar, which means he never showed up at their wedding.  She got the news while she was getting into her wedding dress.  By the time we meet her in the book, it's years and years later, but Miss Haversham is still wearing her wedding dress.  She has only one shoe on because she hadn't put the other one on when she got the bad news.  The  stocking on the foot without a shoe is really ragged, but she still wears it.  I'm not sure she ever took a bath after she heard.  Miss Haversham went crazy and keeps her house the way it was then.  The wedding feast is still on the table.  That was a spooky scene in the movie.  I think there were cobwebs and mice or rats all over what was left of the food.	2003-03-08

There are notes on them (Vida Derry, Michael and Molly Hardwick, Robin Miller, Tony Parker, Ronald Seth, Frank Usher, and James Wentworth Day)on the back flap of the dust jacket.  There's even an index.  I first read this book when I was in school.  It's still a nice collection of old stories retold.  Most of the stories are about British ghosts, such as No. 50 Berkeley Sqaure, Borley Rectory, Ballechin, Hinton Ampner, Itchells Manor, Raynham, etc.  There are helpful ghosts, evil ghosts, ghosts getting revenge, military ghosts, royal ghosts, etc.	2002-11-23

Falco has bad luck in spades.  My eyes didn't glaze over once while I was reading.  (Okay, I did fall asleep after chapter 19, but it *was* 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. When I woke up, I grabbed for the book before I grabbed for my glasses and my cat was miffed by how long it took me to fetch her morning ration of canned catfood.)<br />I love mysteries where our hero/heroine has loads of odd relatives.  It's rather nice that with this couple the problem kin are from both sides.  After all the trouble Helena's brothers were, it was good to see them put through their paces later on.  <br />The historical details were a plus.  I enjoyed having them sandwiched in with dealing with the various workmen.  <br />The last few chapters might as well have been lumped under the title, &quot;The Perils of Public Informer Falco &amp; Family&quot;.  They go from one very dangerous situation to another to another.  <br />In short, I had a lot of fun with this entry.	2002-11-05

Yes, it takes awhile to get to the danger, but the scenes of New Orleans and Benjamin January's lives are so rich that I didn't care.  As usual, I was taken by the contrast among the lives of Ben and his sisters.  Dominique, pregnant and in love with her protector, Henri, has her lifestyle threatened by Henri's marriage to a young lady of icy reputation.  The bride sold her own nurse!  Can such a she-monster be expected to let Henri spend time with and money on his lovely placee?  If you thought Olympe was the strong sister and Minou only a pampered weakling, this book will change your mind.<br />I loved seeing Ben and Rose's relationship progress.  Since this is a Barbara Hambly book, you can't expect them to go through gunfire, fire, and a hurricane with just a few scratches, but it isn't all bad, thank goodness.<br />Hellfire Hessy's murder made me feel sad that so much of her life was wasted, but the second murder is even worse.  Remember the old phrase, \\"Hanging's too good fer them?\\"  Apply that to the killers.<br />Better take mental notes because some of the information that you might suspect is just local color isn't.  It *will* make sense later.  That includes the pirate lore, which was fascinating in its own right.<br />Abishag Shaw (what kind of parents named their son for one of King David's concubines???) is still sharp and sharp shooting.  It's nice to see the Long Arm of the Law actually respect the amateur detective.  It's also nice that he's not stupid.<br />I still have to laugh that the publisher of Ms. Hambly's mysteries is being so cagey about not mentioning her fantasy writing.  I have plenty of friends and relatives who read both genres.  I suspect we're hardly alone in that.	2002-11-05

I'd remembered it from my schooldays and finally found a copy back in 1981.  I read it again last year.  Peggy Bacon also illustrated the book.  There are full page illustrations, half-page ones, and many margin illustrations that allow you to see what the characters look like.  <br />The book opens with three modern [1966] children, Phillip, Ellen, and Jeb Finley, moving from the city to an old house near a village called Heatherfield.  The children are given an upstairs room in the wing that still doesn't have electricity for a playroom.  They're also given an old red velvet chair that their parents found in that panelled room.  It's five-year-old Jeb who notices the kitty with the amazing opal eyes first.  The cat casts as much light as a candle, but she can be seen only when it's dark.  Opalina has the copious self-esteem of most cats.  She tells the children that she is a Very Important Presence.  She also sleeps a lot.  I like the fact that this ghost of an 18th century cat uses old-fashioned figures of speech.  <br />    Opalina came to the house when her lovely rich owner, Angelica, married Ben Trumbull, who had inherited it from his father.  Ben has a nasty brother named Saul who was cruel to Opalina and to Angelica's young orphaned cousin, Horace, after he moved back in in 1754.  Saul built the wing where the playroom is.  Saul is Up to No Good and it's up to Opalina to do something about it.<br />     Opalina's next tale is set in 1766, when Angelica's frivolous Aunt Selina and her pampered pooch, Tootsie, move in.  Aunt Selina has a suitor, the mincing, flowery Sir Humphrey Pomme de Terre [for those of you who didn't have to study French in school, a pomme de terre (apple of the earth/ground) is a potato.  Ben is suspicious of this fellow and doesn't want him hanging around his wife's aunt.  Is Sir Humphrey what he seems?<BR>You'll probably love the scene where two of Ben's children pretend to be Sir Humphrey courting Aunt Selina, but Sir H is not amused.  Worse, he blames it on Horace and demands they duel, even though poor Horace is no match for him.  <br />We jump again to 1785, when Phoebe and Jim, two of Ben and Angelica's grandchildren, are the next subject.  Theirs is the adventure of the rowboat.  Their game of pirates takes an unpleasant turn when they meet Mr. Murphy, who is as ugly in heart as he is of face.  I laughed aloud at what Opalina did to Murphy.<br />Skipping over to life number 6, in 1880, we meet the wild twins, Patrick and Pelley.  Their grandparents own Opalina's house and their mother finds it quite convenient to pack the little bundles of energy off to her parents' house for a week.  Their adventure, with woodsman Batsy Diggs (a lovely matter of miscommunications and misunderstandings), happens when they're ten years old.  The twins have fun, but poor Grandpa's nerves are sorely tried.<br />The story I remembered the best was about pale, pretty, exquisitely dressed young Cousin Sophy from 1905.  Sophy thinks her country cousins are rude bumpkins.  Sophy's parents think their tattletale daughter is the perfect little lady and her aunts and uncles just don't understand why her cousins don't want to play with her.  Wait for the grand unmasking....  <br />Opalina saves the day once again in her 8th life, in 1932.  I will say no more except that it involves the past.<br />The last chapter leads to a Halloween that will never be forgotten.  We who have loved Opalina are free to think of her still in her velvet chair in the panelled room.  She's a very special cat and couldn't possibly be limited to nine lives.	2002-10-12

Eddy and his older sister, Eleanor, don't just get to see 3-D views -- they can enter them to have adventures, such as meeting some of their ancestors from Puritan days.  Herman the Crazy Cat shows the way. <br /><br />Eddy and Eleanor need the distraction because they both feel very guilty about the accident to their Uncle Fred's student, John Green.  John is in a coma and Uncle Fred has to take out a loan to pay the hospital bills.  Mr. Preek the banker and his secretary, Miss Prawn, are so happy.  They're sure that they will be able to foreclose on the loan.  Then they can finally destroy the Halls' fancy old house that they hate so much.  Besides, Miss Prawn wants some of the Halls' antiques to sell. <br /><br />Will Eleanor and Eddy rescue their cat from being trapped in the stereoscope?  Will they be able to prevent a human sacrifice in one of their adventures?  Will Prince Krishna's potted palm wander the universe forever?  Will John ever come out of his coma?  Will the Hall family lose their home? <br /><br />By the way, the hot air balloon on the cover really is in the book.  It's part of a guided tour that's the most astonishing view the stereoscope has.	2002-03-11

I was lucky enough to find hardcover copies of all three at the same library used book sale in 1982.  I decided to reread them all again over this past weekend.<br /><br />Prince Krishna has built a lovely summerhouse for Eleanor and Eddy Hall.  This is no ordinary summerhouse.  There's a magical adventure built into each archway.  You enter the adventure by jumping off the swing.  Once the magic starts, there's only so many swings until the summerhouse disappears forever.  The bugs haven't been worked out of the last adventure before Prince Krishna has to fly back to his native country to avert war.  Prince Krishna takes precautions by boarding up the archway, painting \\"KEEP OUT\\" on the boards, getting Eddy and Eleanor to promise they won't go through that archway, and not putting a swing in the summerhouse.<br /><br />Prince Krishna's precautions are in vain.  Eddy hangs a swing in the summerhouse.  Of course Eddy wouldn't break his promise, but his obnoxious friend, Oliver, didn't promise anything.  Oliver sees the \\"keep out\\" notice as a challenge.  He swings until he breaks the boards with his feet, then sails off the swing -- and vanishes!  What's poor Eddy going to do?  Oliver's parents are very worried, but he can't tell them that Oliver jumped off the swing and disappeared into thin air.  They'd think he was nuts.  Eddy can't go through the SAME archway because of his promise, but that doesn't mean he can't go through the OTHER archways.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Eleanor is very suspicious of Uncle Fred's new student, Mrs. Dorian, who has moved next door along with her little girl, Georgie, who isn't even in school yet. Eleanor is sure that Mrs. Dorian is a witch and has bewitched Uncle Freddy, because her uncle acts so silly around her.  If you're older than Eleanor, you can probably figure out why.<br /><br />Eleanor and Eddy don't get along as well as they did in THE DIAMOND IN THE WINDOW.  Eddy has become a normal, messy boy who loves junk.  He makes Eleanor so mad because she's become a prissy prig.  Eleanor can hardly wait until she's old enough to wear pretty dresses and go to dances.  She hates the fact that her uncle's school isn't making them rich because Uncle Freddy cares more about teaching than making money.  Will the summerhouse show Eleanor the error of her ways?<br /><br />My favorite archway adventure was \\"Make New Worlds\\".  Sure, the man-castle and the big clipper ship were neat and the giant cash-register can teach you how much you're worth, but what's that compared to having the worlds you create come alive?  (If you don't like the world of Princess Cinderellanor, wait until it's invaded by Eddy and Georgie's worlds!)<br /><br />Time goes by.  There's a tick-tock every time the swing is swung.  All the adventures before the dangerous one have been tried, but Oliver is still missing.  Eddy boarded up the archway after his friend disappeared, but Georgie is tempted.  Georgie wants so much to be able to read and add two and two.  Georgie is sure that she'll get what she wants if SHE breaks the boards and goes through.  Will she?  Of course she will.  Who's going to rescue her (not to mention Oliver)?  Eddy and Eleanor don't know it, but time is running out....THE WINDOW.  Eddy has become a normal, messy boy who loves junk.

After I finished it, I had to get the earlier books:  Sweet, Savage Death; Wicked, Loving Murder; Death's Savage Passion; and Rich, Radiant Slaughter.<br />Pay has gone home for her wedding, so aside from her best friend, Phoebe(of course), we don't get the usual serving of romance writers and publishing problems.  That's all right.  Pay's McKenna relatives are the kind of people who are fun in fiction, but...  If your family makes them seem sweet and normal, you're probably going to be reading this book from a nice psychiatric ward.  For example, Pay tells us that her Great-Aunt Felicia always reminded her of Queen Elizabeth I the day she ordered Essex executed.  The section where the family argues about whether or not Uncle Ephram deserves to be buried in the McKenna graveyard is not to be missed, especially when Aunt Cordie goes into her act.<br />Tommy Dick the local policeman is sure that Damon Rask of the House That Looks Like a Hovering Flying Saucer is a killer.  Is he right?  Why is there an odd little strip of land between the old Chistleworth and Deverton properties?  What does it have to do with the plot?  Is Pay going to be able to keep from getting killed long enough to have her wedding?  Is her mother going to be able to refrain from killing her in-laws?  What about Phoebe's baby on the way, first met in Rich, Radiant Slaughter?  Go ahead and find out.  It's a short read and a merry one.	2002-02-05

The first three are (in order):  Sweet, Savage Death; Wicked, Loving Murder; and Death's Savage Passion.  The fifth Patience \\"Pay\\" Campbell McKenna book is Once And Always Murder.  Like the previous books, Rich, Radiant Slaughter gives the reader a hard eyed-look at what writers must endure, particularly romance writers.  This time Pay and her best friend, best-selling romance writer Phoebe Damereaux, are part of a book tour to benefit the homeless.  The tour is complicated by Phoebe's morning sickness and -- of course -- murder.  Make that plural.  Is the killer the dangerous popular author, Christopher Brand, who once stabbed a bookstore clerk in Tacoma (with a penknife)?  How about the filthy rich Jonathon Lowry with the interesting method of avoiding having to pay income tax?  Perhaps you favor the holier-than-thou Tempesta Stewart?  Pay thinks her eight-year-old adopted daughter, Adrienne, is too young to be around murder.  Adrienne disagrees, but the killer is going to put a lot of people in grave danger before the story's end. <br />    As with the other books in this series, the descriptions are delightful.  Perhaps a couple will help you decide if this book is for you:  \\"She was dressed in full Phoebe Damereaux regalia that morning, even though it was barely seven o'clock and we were on a train.  Floor-length jade-green velvet caftan, nine strands of twenty-four-inch rope diamonds, diamond globe earrings big enough to use as crystal balls, ostrich feather hair combs in her wiry black hair:  at the terminal in Baltimore there would be press, and Phoebe would be ready for them.\\"<br />\\"The mainstream press likes to pain romance writers as pink, fluffy little things, with dithering brains and vague smiles and a passionate desire to please.  Amelia Samson was five-ten and weighed two-forty.  She had spent her twenties running a mangle in a steam laundry, in the days before all that was automated.  The muscular development of her shoulders and upper arms was awesome.  She looked like a linebaker--or would have, if she hadn't been wearing a beaded Worth traveling suit just as well-armored and well-constructed as she was herself.  Christopher Brand worked out with weights two hours a day seven days a week.  Amelia could have crumpled him up like a piece of paper.\\"<br />If the copy you buy doesn't have the dust jacket, don't worry.  You won't have missed much.  The dark background had a rectangle with a pair of blue-fingered hands inside.  Each forefinger had a blue beam like a searchlight coming from it and the beams crossed each other.  Yawn.	2002-02-05

Some of writing you can also get in A PLEASING TERROR, the Ash Tree Press hefty book collecting M. R. James fiction and non-fection writings on the supernatural, but that doesn't have the illustrations you'll find here.  There are reproductions of woodcuts and engravings of older supernatural works, illustrations of M.R. James and his works (including some of the illustrations for  THE FIVE JARS), and photographs.  <br />Personally, I enjoyed the way Dr. James verbally ripped apart the claim that a certain painting of the Annunciation was the work of a secret Satanist (yes, a picture of the painting is included).  There's even a tribute by Christopher Lee.  I found this book added to my enjoyment of M. R. James' work.  I hope it will do the same for you.	2002-02-05

I have a few of the author's books written as Jane Haddam.  These are lighter and funnier in tone.  Except for the fifth book, they all skewer the publishing business, particularly Romance.  (Now you know where the strange titles come from.)<br />The exerpt stops before the acid really starts.   You should enjoy what Pay McKenna tells us she did with a past issue of \\"Writing\\".  The descriptions (and dialog) are what make this book so much fun to read.  You have unpleasant characters, losers, eccentrics, and insights into Romance Writers, not to mention the Hazards of Becoming/Being a Writer.<br />So who killed Michael Brookfield?  Was it his Abusive Aunt Alida?  One of his brothers?  His aunt's right-hand woman, the terribly perfect Felicity Aldershot?  Marty the Comptroller?  Mrs. Haskell the Irate Client?  Ivy the even more seriously screwed client?  There is something definitely rotten at Writing Enterprises, and its not just their advice (or even Michael's corpse).  If it weren't for her best friend, Phoebe, McKenna would love to walk out on it all.    <br />Don't let the boring cover fool you.  Even the original Crime Club dustjacket with the partial view of a person whose neck is wrapped around three times by a black ribbon with red hearts on it was more interesting -- and more fitting for such a funny book.	2002-02-05

I like Samuel Villari, the detective (although I agree with Maggie's conflict of interest comments).  I like his parents.  The scene where Maggie meets Papa Villari and the Dragon Lady is my favorite in the whole book.<br />It's a pity that Elizabeth was killed instead of one of her obnoxious grandchildren because I would have liked to have seen more of her.  She was a grand lady.  <br />Why did Elizabeth want to see Lindsay Burns?  How does the obnoxious cop whom Maggie calls &quot;Vacuum Nose&quot; fit into the picture?  How is Maggie going to find Elizabeth's killer while Will and Cassie are pestering her about the money and Villari (in time-honored professional male detective/cop dealing with female amateur fashion) is telling her to butt out before she gets herself killed?<br />Don't expect a lot in the way of suspense.  I bought this for the promised laughs and on that score, the book delivers, for which I thank the author.	2001-10-22

This mystery fulfills the first part admirably.  While we don't know the personality of the murder victim in 1879, &quot;Pruneface&quot; Hooper was evil.  The lie she spread about Kit Smith alone is enough to earn Hooper that status.  It's a good thing for her grandson that she died before he became a teenager.  I do hope his father can turn him around.<br />Loved the reason Aunt Dimity can't communicate with Pruneface.  Although virtually everyone in Finch hopes the killer is never found, Aunt Dimity doesn't agree.  Her reason turns out to be correct.<br />Of the suspects, who killed the Queen of Malice?  Was it Mr. Wetherhead of the Miniature Train Museum, who isn't as lame as he used to be?  Was it Miranda Morrow, the telephone witch?  <BR>How about Sally Pyne who runs the tearoom?  Did she serve Pruneface a dessert that was just instead of sweet?  Did the pub-keeping Peacocks cook up something besides calorie-laden food?  Isn't Peggy Taxman going overboard on her displays of grief over the death of her old friend?  Why is Mr. Barlow missing?<br />As for Nicholas Fox, is the sexy martial-arts instructor really trying to find the killer to help his uncle, the vicar?  <br />There's an old saying that there's no smoke without fire.  Is there ANY truth behind the rumors Pruneface was so eagerly spreading?      <br />Unless you happen to be a horrible and nasty person yourself (in which case I recommend you find a different series to read), you should be satisfied with the author's choice of killer.<br />There's only one nit I'd like to pick about this book.  One of the themes I've loved in this series is that Prince [and Princess] Charmings come in all shapes and sizes.  That's why I find the changes in Emma and Bill so disappointing.	2001-10-22

My copy is a 1922 2nd printing that kept me up until 1:35 in the morning and as soon as I woke up (after feeding the cat), I started on the sequel, ROBIN.<br />The book covers the late 19th century through the summer of 1914.  The Head of the House of Coombe is considered a very, very wicked man.  He has never married.  He supports Feather, a selfish, frivolous widow with the face and eyes of an angel.  Feather is Robin's mother, but not much of one.  Poor little Robin is six years old before she even knows what mothers are, let alone that she has one.  It is Lord Coombe who changes Robin's loveless and cheerless existence even as his relationship with her mother inadvertently ends her first friendship.  Is she secretly his daughter, as some gossips would have it?  Much later in the book, as years pass, we find out why Lord Coombe supports Feather and does so much for Robin, who hates him because of the loss of Donal, her friend.  We also meet an elderly Duchess, who is the Head's old friend and very intelligent woman.  There's a evil German agent who has evil designs on the beautiful and intelligent, but naive, teen that Robin has become.  Robin meets her Donal again at her very first party.  He is a handsome young man.  Will their friendship resume where it left off?  By the way, during the party a girl named Kathryn casually tells Robin that &quot;...somebody important has been assassinated in the Balkan countries.&quot;  If you know your history, you know what that means.  If this reprint doesn't include ROBIN, then buy or borrow a used copy.	2001-09-10

That role is left to her older sister, sweet and not overly bright Rosalie. The story starts out with Rosalie being courted by and married to Sir Nigel Anstruthers, an impoverished English aristocrat on the make for a rich wife. Although she is only eight at the time, Betty hates Sir Nigel. Her instincts are on the money. Sir Nigel is a rotter, a blackguard, a cad, and a bounder. He is utterly infuriated that he did not automatically gain control of Rosalie's money when he married her. He and his equally appalling mother start a loathsome campaign of emotional abuse that gentle Rosalie is not equal to. Luckily, by chapter five it is 12 years later and Bettina has grown into a fine, strong-minded woman who has all the business sense that made the Vanderpoel fortune. The rest of the book tells us how she rescues her sister, her nephew, and the Anstruthers estate from Sir Nigel. The hero of the book is another impoverished aristocrat, but cut from genuinely noble cloth, even if most of his ancestors were of the Sir Nigel type.<BR>Before the book is over, Bettina will be trapped, injured, and at the mercy of Sir Nigel, who has Perfectly Awful plans for the lovely lady. Will Bettina wring her hands helplessly and beg?<BR>Don't be silly.  Read and see how love, virtue, and justice triumph and Sir Nigel gets his.	2001-09-10

It does.  No the book isn't too complex, there aren't too many characters, too many subplots, or too many flashbacks.  Frankly, I liked the part about Xander's cousin because it gave Xander (the token &quot;normal&quot; of the Scooby Gang), another chance to let the true nobility of his character shine.  The problem with both books is that Ms. Holder seems to forget that she's writing entries in a series, not one-shots.  Both books have far too much death and destruction going on in Sunnydale for a series.  Enough happens to Sunnydale in this one to have it declared a Federal Disaster Area and take years to pull itself back together.  In fact, if not for some little hints in the last few pages, I'd be expecting the entire planet to have been rocked back to the Stone Age by the Gatherer's power.  It's a shame, because other than this flaw, Ms. Holder is one of the best writers of Buffy books and this is a very worthy effort.        I do agree with other reviewers who recommend that you read the Gatehouse Trilogy and PRETTY MAIDS ALL IN A ROW before this book, but not because you need to have read them in order to understand THE BOOK OF FOURS.  I think you should read them first because this book contains &quot;spoilers&quot; for them.  Now I wish I had ready PRETTY MAIDS first.      I look forward to the story of how Buffy will free India even if Ms. Holder doesn't tone the disasters down to a believable level.  Her writing is compelling enough to keep me going even while I gritting my teeth.	2001-06-17

Both Peter and Selma feel, &quot;I might as well be dead.&quot;  Luckily for them, Nero Wolfe and Archie are not convinced that Peter Hays is guilty.  But if Peter Hays is innocent, who killed Michael Molloy?  Who else had a motive? As Wolfe looks into Molloy's affairs, it becomes apparent that the victim's life was hardly on the up and up, although you'll have to wait for the climactic unveiling of the killer to find out what was really going on.<br />There will be more murders before that unveiling, as well as a judicious sprinkling of red herrings (which I blush to admit I fell for).  <br />So who did kill Molloy?  His lovely widow's alibi seems pretty solid, but could she have been part of a plot?  What about the Irwins or the Arkoffs, friends on whose word Selma's alibi rests?  What about her other friend, Peter Degan?  Was Molloy's secretary really innocent of fooling around with her boss?  She's engaged to a hothead -- did he kill Molloy?<br />In case Inspector Cramer's complaint about Mrs. Alice Bolt at the beginning of chapter 16 makes no sense, there's an old song called &quot;Ben Bolt&quot;, the first line of which is &quot;Oh don't you remember sweet Alice, Ben Bolt&quot;.  <br />As usual, Archie makes amusingly insulting remarks about the obnoxious genius who employs him.  My personal favorite for this book is borrowed from Aesop's Fables.  You'll find it in chapter 17.<br />I like other entries in the series better, but MIGHT AS WELL BE DEAD is certainly worth your while.	2001-05-21

It was Saturday, but I still woke up at the regular time.  The pharmacy wouldn't be open for hours.  I figured I could put down RESORT TO MURDER when the time came and finish it when I came home.  WRONG!  I didn't leave until after I finished.  By the time I was almost there, the rain had started again.  While I was walking through the parking lot, pea-sized hail was bouncing off my umbrella!  Why hadn't I picked a duller book?<br />Has Henrie O's former son-in-law made another mistake in picking the bride for him?  Is Connor, his new love, a woman who just feels the need to have men admire her, as her older daughter says, or is she a man-trap who loves manipulating her conquests?<br />Is the ghost of the hotel manager's late husband really haunting the tower?  Is the ghost appearing so close to the first anniversary of his death because it was murder, not an accident?<br />How far is Henrie's granddaughter willing to go to keep her father from marrying Connor?<br />Is Connor really in danger?  <br />Is Marlow really a loving daughter who doesn't mind being outshone by her mother?<br />Will the wedding actually take place?  Should it?  Would Connor be better off marrying her old friend, Steve?<br />Has an innocent party been framed for murder?  Henrie thinks so, but can she find proof?  Can she figure out what's going on? Well of course she can, but will she be able to do so in time to prevent tragedy?<br />It was nice to meet Henrie's grandchildren.  The descriptions of Bermuda add to interest of the plot.  <br />Don't let the dustjacket fool you.  The design may be pretty and peaceful-looking, but there are ugly passions stirring under the cover and not much peace to be found.<br />Note to the publisher:  chapter 20, p.266, full paragraph two, line one.  That &quot;Lloyd&quot; should be &quot;Steve&quot;.  You might wish to fix that for the paperback.	2001-05-20

If not for my younger sister, I probably wouldn't even know who they are.  I picked up a used copy of this book because I thought it would be funny. I enjoyed the descriptions of the cockroach trick, the 3 of clubs eyeballs trick, and the cutting the snake in half trick.  The pictures were delightful.  The cruel tricks reminded me of some I used to read about in &quot;Children's Digest&quot; when I was a kid.  (If you, too, have friends who are too smart for them, you can still amuse yourself by imagining stupid persons you loathe falling for them.)  I think I like the personality test trick the best.  The short stories weren't bad. I'm torn between &quot;The Best Magic Trick I Ever Saw&quot; and &quot;Invisible Thread&quot; for my favorite.  The annoying part is all those pages of red type on light grey paper with a dark grey swirl design smack in the middle.  They are HARD to read.  I had to keep a finger on the line so I wouldn't lose track.  I'm not sure the authors expected anyone to read them because they're chock full of typos. However, if you do take the trouble, you'll read &quot;Penn &amp; Teller get killed&quot;, more cruel tricks on video, a strange tribute to Harry Houdini, the &quot;Sharpening Stone&quot;, another version of &quot;Invisible Thread&quot;, and &quot;Penn &amp; Teller at the Ritz&quot;.  These are definitely very strange men.  Happy Hunting for a copy.	2001-04-08

I wasted my time trying to think of the most lurid possible motive.  On the other hand, the Secret of the Incredible Disappearing Barge was one I hadn't seen coming.<br />I give nothing away by stating that Lyman Breeland is a jerk cut from the same cloth as Peter Kreisler from TRAITOR'S GATE.  In fact, I could hear Lady Vespasia commenting on their type in my head during one of his early appearances.  But does that mean he's guilty? <br />Philo Trace seems to be a really great guy even if he is from the slave-owning South.  Is it all just a mask?<br />I'm not going to automatically condemn one side or the other in my country's Civil War.  My father's family fought for the South. My mother's family is from the North.  I thought Anne Perry did a pretty even-handed job of presenting Breeland and Trace's viewpoints.  However, I don't recall any of the English characters comparing or contrasting the American Civil War with England's Civil War.  I found that odd.<br />At least having Hester and William at the scene of a bloody battle, besides being the best part of the book, enabled William to understand Hester better.  I wonder if Hester is going to exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome in a later book.<br />Speaking of later books, I hope Anne Perry follows up on the tantalizing clue to Monk's past discovered in this one.  Could he really have done anything as disgusting as he fears he might have?<br />Have fun speculating on whether Ms.Perry meant anything by giving her characters names such as &quot;Lyman&quot;, which sounds like &quot;lie, man&quot;; &quot;Meritt&quot;, and &quot;Philo Trace&quot;.  Don't expect much from the courtroom scenes, although I did like the way Rathbone's opponent gave Breeland a well-deserved setdown.	2001-04-04

I was correct in one supposition, but the truth was far stranger than I'd imagined.  <br />For a time it may seem that the typhoid epidemic in evil twin Caleb's stomping grounds is irrelevant, although interesting in itself if you care about medical history.  I liked learning about Hester's version of oral rehydration therapy and blanched when I read about burning tobacco leaves for fumigation.  Do not allow yourself to become impatient.  It's all relevant and that will be revealed in due time.<br />Is Angus' wife, Genevieve, a cold-hearted accessory to his murder?  Did Caleb murder Angus?  Is Angus still alive?  Why did the author give him the same name as one of the Pitts' cats?  (You may ask, but you won't get an answer.)  Since we have another Angus, will an Archie show up?   <br />What about Lord Ravensbrook, who was guardian to the Stonefield brothers?  What's his role in this tragedy?  Mr. Niven was unwittingly ruined by his friend, Angus.  Does he really hold no grudge?<br />Who is the lovely Drusilla and why is she seeking out William Monk?  She's a member of Society, as he isn't.  Certainly her many charms give Monk the opportunity to unfavorably compare Hester to her in his mind.  Will he live to regret this or does Hester have a rival?  Does Hester even care?    <br />If you're a fan of Oliver Rathbone, don't worry.  He'll have plenty to do during the trial scene.  Hester isn't neglected, either.  I thoroughly enjoyed her solution to one person's nasty little trap for our hero.<br />Contrary to what other reviewers have said, this book isn't confusing.  While I admit to having been partially fooled the first time I read it, once a crucial point became clear,everything made perfect sense.  I definitely recommend this novel.	2001-04-01

I've had too much of secret, powerful conspiracy stories from &quot;The X-Files,&quot; and finding their famous phrase, &quot;trust no one&quot;, early in THE WHITECHAPEL CONSPIRACY made me fear the worst.  I shouldn't have.  <br />Did Adinett kill Fetters (an interesting choice for the victim's name because invisible chains hamper everyone in the book)?  If he did, why?  There are many mysteries in this adventure, and these are only two of them.    <br />As usual, Anne Perry asks important questions through her characters, questions that are as relevant today as they were then.  There will always be the corrupt and the idealistic, the Haves and the Have-Nots, plots and counter-plots. Having her characters ponder these matters allows the reader to think about them, too.  The biggest question in this book is that of revolution.  What will it cost?  Will what results be any better than what it replaced?  Although the French Revolution and the Revolution of 1848 are the two Perry mentions, feel free to think of the American Revolution, the Russian Revolution, or any other in history.  What led to them?Which worked?  Which didn't?         <br />Charlotte and Thomas have not stopped caring about the poor, as one reviewer has suggested.  They know that it's the poor who would have suffered the most.  Neither side cares about that.  To the one the poor are lesser creatures who exist to serve.  To the other, they're only &quot;collateral damage.&quot;  I couldn't help thinking of George Orwell's famous ANIMAL FARM as I read this book.  I think that Charlotte, Thomas, and Vespasia would have agreed with his conclusions, had the book existed in 1892.    <br />Nor does Thomas' reassignment to the East End strain credulity.  It was done as much to protect as to punish him.  His enemies aren't just powerful, they aren't in the open.  That's what makes them so difficult to fight.  Loved the way the teeth of one were pulled in the end.<br />Personally, I enjoyed Gracie and Tellman's part in solving the case, especially Tellman telling his new boss a lie that was more true than he realized.<br />Have fun with all the twists and turns this mystery takes.  Just when you think you've figured it out, Anne Perry will bring in another clue that will make you doubt.	2001-03-26

I was buying her books in hardcover as soon as I spotted them before there was an Amazon.com.  Now I routinely pre-order them.  When I pulled PENTECOST ALLEY off the shelf yesterday, I realized I had forgotten who all but the regular characters were and who was the killer.  Some things dimly came back to me while I read, but the story was just as compelling.  Yes, there's the usual contrast between the lives of the filthy rich and those of the filthy poor, but I've never known Anne Perry to fail to bring them to life.  <br />Is Finley Fitzjames guilty?  The more I learned about his father, Augustus, the worse he seemed, but that didn't mean his son was a murderer.  If someone was framing Finley, why?  Did anyone hate Finley that much or did someone want to get revenge on the father through the son?  The best member of the Fitzjames family is the daughter, Tallulah.  Underneath that party-loving exterior is intelligence and fire.  She's certain that her beloved brother is innocent, but how can she prove it?   While she's at it, can she make up her mind between her life of luxury and a very worthy, but poor man whom she loves but who thinks she's only a social butterfly?<br />Emily Radley's life has been just as useless as Tallulah's lately.  Her husband is fighting for the right in Parliament so they don't have much time together.  Her servants are so competent that they could easily manage the household without her.  Worse, she has Grandmama living with her.  The other women of the family have grown and changed since book one, but Grandmama is a narrow-minded and nasty as ever.  It's a good thing we have Lady Vespasia to show us that an elderly widow can still be vital and involved.     What Emily needs is to be involved in another of her brother-in-law's cases.  Will her new aquaintance with Tallulah give her the chance to be something other than decorative and charming?     When things go horribly wrong, asthey will, Charlotte will have to step in, too.  More than just her husband's career is at stake.  There's been an outbreak of violence.  Will more follow? Full scale riots?  Anarchy?  It's a very tense situation. No one has forgotten that Jack the Ripper business only a couple of years ago, nor the fact that the killer was never caught.     Don't miss the scene where Emily, Charlotte, and Tallulah forsake their good clothes to visit the brothels for clues.  I loved the frank assessment of their chances for success as ladies of the evening.     Pay attention to the names of even the most briefly-noted characters.  One of them is the same as that of a character in a famous classic novel.  I wish I knew if that were coincidence or deliberate.<br />    As usual in one of Anne Perry's mysteries, morality, principles, and soul searching play a prominent role.  One of the other reviewers mentioned the author's past, but failed to mention that she was only a schoolgirl at the time.  <br />    If you're looking for a book that's fast-paced and shallow, with characters of cardboard, PENTECOST ALLEY is not for you.  If you demand more from your mysteries, I highly recommend this book and the whole series.	2001-03-25
US	52640067	RGYQOH6DSFKXH	0553239317	713074454	And Be a Villain	Books	5	7	9	N	N	One of Wolfe's Most Difficult Cases	It's been almost a week since guest Cyril Orchard was poisoned on the popular Madeline Fraser radio show.  The police haven't solved the case and, at the rate they're going, they never will.  Luckily for everyone but the killer, Nero Wolfe needs money and is quite willing to allow himself to be hired to solve the mystery.     Our suspects are Madeline Fraser herself, her scripwriter, her straight man, her manager, another guest, and the representatives for the agency and the sponsers.  Nancylee, the high school student fan, is a serious pest instead of contender for the role of poisoner, but she could know something useful.  However, she's not available for questioning.  Where did she go and why?      How does the mysterious Zeck, master criminal, fit in? Archie doesn't know.  What he does know, and it's driving him crazy, is that Wolfe seems determined to do as little work as possible on the case.  Of course, this is Wolfe's normal attitude toward work, but this time the case is taking weeks instead of days.  It's Archie's job to prod Wolfe into earning his fee.  The method he uses in this case isn't quite as dramatic as the ones in NOT QUITE DEAD ENOUGH or &quot;Invitation to Murder&quot; (THREE MEN OUT), but it's one of his best tricks.  I rank the scene where he sets it up and gets Wolfe hooked right up there with the scenes where Wolfe rejects &quot;Sweeties&quot; and puts Nancylee in her place.  (I must admit that the scene where Wolfe triumphs over Deputy Commissioner O'Hara's attempt to force his hand has considerable charm of its own.)     The introduction was written by persons who actually lived through the period in which this book takes place.  Those readers who, like myself, hadn't even been born, might find their comments interesting.  The piece of memorabilia in this edition is tied with that in the most recent edition of THE SECOND CONFESSION.  The two together are not likely to make sense unless you know that in the book club edition of AND BE A VILLAIN, the poisoned drink is called &quot;Starlite&quot;.  It's back to &quot;Hi-Spot&quot; in the 1950 first paperback edition, so whatever problem might have caused the temporary name change must have been cleared up.  Chapter 22, page 199, paragraph 3, line 7:  checking back with a couple of earlier editions makes it clear that the &quot;tired&quot; in that line is supposed to be &quot;tried,&quot; as you would expect from the context.  For purists, yes, that &quot;blindman's bluff&quot; on page 216 WAS correctly spelled &quot;buff&quot; originally, but the error had already crept in as early as that 1950 paperback.  Similarly, the ninth word in the fifth line of the first paragraph of chapter 26 was properly hyphenated before.  I bother to mention these because I've read that Rex Stout was noted for turning in manuscripts that had no errors, so it's only fair to his memory to let the readers know that he wasn't responsible for these.               I highly recommend this book.	2001-01-16
US	52640067	R8CQ0NEGYZIYM	0743400356	449308134	Revenant (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)	Books	5	14	16	N	N	Lots of action, plenty of menace, good dash of humor	REVENANT starts out in a popular &quot;Buffy&quot; location:  a cemetary.  Buffy, Willow, and Angel are there because of Willow's friend, Jia Li Rong, who, with her family, has emigrated from China to America.  [Yes, this story takes place before high school graduation.]  In the first chapter Mr.Odom manages to give us some background on Chinese beliefs, including that of the Hungry Ghost; a funny look at male-female communication differences, and sets us up for the fight in chapter two.  The book gets even better from there.  I have no idea if the author is describing the fighting moves accurately, but he writes the battles in such detail that I could easily picture them in my mind.  This adventure's well-meaning [sort of] character meddling with forces he doesn't fully comprehend is Jia Li's older brother, Lok.  The further you read, the more you'll learn about why Lok is the way he is, but you'll still have to wonder if he'll survive to be sadder but wiser in the end.   Speaking of sadder but not-necessarily-wiser, Xander falls for a beautiful Asian superwoman who rescues him from one of the many nasty situations that fill this story.  You know it's not going to work out.  It's only a matter of learning how it won't.  There's a gang of mixed humans and demons causing death and destruction and a mysterious Chinese businessman named Zhiyong.  Supposedly, he's here to create lots of new jobs in Sunnydale, but we don't believe that, do we?  Of course not.  Did I mention the danger-packed fight scenes?  There are probably chapters without one, but it won't seem that way.  Everyone gets to use his/her talents to save the world from the evil magic-infested threat.  Even Cordelia and Mrs. Summers get a chance to help.  Mr. Odem is one of the Buffy novelists who manages to write the characters accurately, including their funny side.  REVENANT is really worth adding to your collection...	2001-01-05
US	52640067	R3APCTRL10BLPB	0312865031	560291470	Gravelight	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Third Time is a Charmer	When I met Wycherly Musgrave, Winter's brother, in WITCHLIGHT, he seemed like just one more thoroughly unlikeable member of a unlikeable and dysfunctional family.  In GRAVELIGHT I learned that he's probably the only other member of the family who's worthwhile.  Unlike his sister's adventure of the mind, we don't have to wait three-quarters of the book to find out what he's running from.  Yes, he has good reason for hating himself. It was interesting to find out what happened to the Musgraves.  Too bad that Wycherly is the only other sibling to break away. Will he find the truth and shall it set him free?  GRAVELIGHT starts out with a chapter that sets us up for what is to come.  Quentin Blackburn certainly misjudged the will of his lover, Athanais Dellon.  Unfortunately, Attie didn't succeed in wiping out his evil influence.     Unlike the first two books, this one changes viewpoint from character to character before tying everything together.  This enabled the author to accomplish more than she could have by sticking with any one character.  I enjoyed learning about Athanais and present-day Melusine (&quot;Sinah&quot;) Dellon's self-serving ancestress and the origin of the Dark Brooding Evil Menace in Morton's Fork [great name!].  I enjoyed seeing Truth Jourdemayne and Dylan Palmer again, although the reversal of their believer-skeptic roles made me worry that they wouldn't be together by the end.  I think Ms. Bradley chose wisely in the manner in which she resolved the problem.  However I didn't understand why there should be any trouble between Truth and another character in GHOSTLIGHT who makes an appearance here and I still don't.    Little nugget of information:  according to one of the many catalogs that clutter up my mailbox, those little bricks of Fels-Naptha that Truth wonders about in chapter five are heavy-duty laundry soap.     Just as I found the climax of GRAVELIGHT more powerful and satisfying than that of its predecessors, I think this book has themost powerful and evocative cover.  With the other two, I don't think it would matter much if the paperback cover doesn't include the entire wraparound design of the hardcover's dustjacket, but in this case it would.  I love the glimpse of the ruined sanatorium with the light streaming through and around it!	2001-01-04
US	52640067	R2J7PE2EUTKAN4	0736627979	518397495	Black Orchids	Books	5	9	10	N	N	This is for the text version	BLACK ORCHIDS is number nine in Nero Wolfe series and the first  to contain shorter novels put together.  The first is &quot;Black Orchids&quot;  Fond as I am of the fat genius, I must admit that this adventure showcases the less-admirable qualities of his complex character.  It's not true that Nero Wolfe never leaves his house on business, but it rarely happens.  Wolfe probably would not have attended this flower show.  He hates car rides and he hates being touched (which is bound to happen with crowds)  However,  the three black orchid hybrids produced by Lewis Hewitt, Long Island millionaire and Old Money gentleman, have filled Wolfe with &quot;an agony of envy&quot;, as Archie puts it.  Wolfe needs to see these plants for himself, which is too bad for the killer.  Why?  Mr. Hewitt could have a nasty scandal about him if the killer isn't found.  Wolfe has failed to flatter and otherwise bootlick Mr. Hewitt into selling him one of the plants.  Now Wolfe shows his unbridled greed by demanding all three of them  to solve the case.  Archie manages to latch onto an important clue on his own and Wolfe makes good use of it.  As usual, Archie's descriptions are colorful and amusing, and the interplay between the faithful assistant and his brilliant boss is not to be missed.  They know each other so well.  I loved the call Archie made to bring Inspector Cramer to the homicide.  I also loved the reception smirking Johnny Keems, one of detectives Wolfe sometimes hires, got from Wolfe when he tried to prove that he could be as good as Archie.  Some readers might object to the means Wolfe uses to trap the killer as Cramer does, but I happen to agree with Wolfe on the subject.  I believe that this was one of Wolfe's best traps.  For younger readers, yes, the one female character was quite correct in claiming that her family's honor was at stake.  Society has changed.  As for the &quot;...pair of vintage Helen Hokinsons from Bronxville&quot; whom Archie meets in chapter two, the 1996 revision of Rev. Frederick G. Gotwald's &quot;The Nero Wolfe Companion No.2&quot; tells us that Ms. Hokinson was an artist whose gently satirical cartoons of society matrons appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine.  The second story is &quot;Cordially Invited to Meet Death&quot;.  Someone is sending nasty anonymous letters to the clients of famous society party-arranger Bess Huddleston and Miss Huddleston wants Nero Wolfe to put a stop to it.  Wolfe already has a bit of a grudge against Miss Huddleston from an suggestion she made two years before, but he takes the case.  Chapter one ends with an fun exchange defining Archie's role in Wolfe's life that is only partly insulting.  In Chapter two we meet the main suspects, Miss Janet Nichols and Miss Maryella Timms, assistant and secretary, respectively, to the client.  Archie doesn't like Miss Timms' Southern accent, but the lady manages to earn one of the most cordial and respectful treatments Wolfe is ever seen giving a woman.  In the next chapter we're treated to Archie's meeting with the chimp and one of the alligators kept at the Huddleston place, not to mention the incident that leads to the death in the title.  It's an ugly one that should have some readers wanting to make sure their shots are current.  The death is being written off as a very sad accident, but the victim's brother insists that it was murder. Is he right?  Don't miss the scene where Archie tails one of the suspects -- it's worth a laugh.  Even after Nero Wolfe solves the mystery, a mystery remains.  Archie lays it out for the reader and gives us his own choice.  You may or may not agree with him.  By the way, the same &quot;Nero Wolfe Companion&quot; gives a woman named Elsa Maxwell as the model for Bess Huddleston, and states that she wrote a book titled R.S.V.P. if you want to know more about her.  BLACK ORCHIDS is one of my personal favorites.  If you prefer text to audio versions of books, ..., to get yourself a copy.  The most recent edition, as of this writing, is the 1992 Bantam reissue.  It has a special introduction by Lawrence Block and a reproduction of the cover to the first Bantam edition if you like memorabilia.  If you have your heart set on a hardcover copy, be warned that they're much harder to come by than the paperback versions.	2001-01-04
US	52640067	R2Q6EA7NC0QOG5	0892967161	801588825	One Virgin Too Many (The Eleventh Marcus Didius Falco Novel)	Books	5	9	12	N	N	Adventure, Intrigue, and Historial Information in One	Now that he has a child to support, you knew that sooner or later Falco was going to need a day job.  Trust Falco's luck that it would be one he's not going to consider the honor outweighing the drawbacks.  Trust Ms. Davis to make sure that Falco will still have to investigate.  In the hands of a less competent author, the reader might complain that it's too coincidental that Falco's sacred geese gig gets him closer to the religious community in which the murder takes place, not to mention the connections his brother-in-law and neice have with the case.  With Lindsey Davis, it just seems inevitable.   What little I know about the Vestal Virgins comes mostly from &quot;I Claudius&quot;, so the details provided here were very welcome. (Virgin Constantia was fun to meet.)  I must say that the restrictions the Flamen Dialis, the top man among priests, must live under seem incredible (that anyone would take the job, let alone want it).  If they really worked to keep the fellow out of trouble, it might be worthwhile trying that trick on some modern politicians.  Actually, the priestly family of little Gaia Laelia, the child who thinks one of her relatives is trying to kill her, is an excellent example of the effect an unnatural way of life can have on the generations that follow.      If you've ever envied royalty, the example of Queen Berenice of Judea should give you pause.  In spite of my disapproval of her past and the way she turned to a grown son after failing with his father, I felt sorry for her.        Unlike one of the other reviewers, I think Falco has plenty of reason to feel as he does about Anacrites.  I would be horrified if either of my sisters might marry any of the men against whom I filed my on-public-record EEO complaints, and none of them tried to have me killed.  (Of course, I would expect my sisters to have better sense.)  I have a different favorite suspect for Maia's next husband, but I could be wrong.    Ms. Davis is avoiding one of the sins of mystery series by having the characters change and grow, with one exception:  Falco's family.  Well, I wouldn't expect his parents to change; they're pretty set in their ways.  But I was ticked off about the way his sister blamed him for her worthless husband's death. I lent my copy to one of my brothers, and he was angrier about it than I was.  He was particularly irritated that Helena didn't stick up for Falco and complained vehemently that some of the women in his family seemed to think that teaching Falco a lesson was more important than that a little girl might die.  When  Falco's nephew was starting to act like the man of his family, my brother wanted Falco to point out to the lad that he did the same thing when his brother ran out on the family to join the army and his father just ran out on the family -- and look at the way the family treats him.  He wanted Falco to advise his nephew to look at his grandmother and realize that was what his mother would be like in ten years.  (Now there's a hideous thought.)  However, my brother did stay up until 3 a.m. to finish this book, so he obviously found it otherwise good.    If you've never read any of the Falco books before, you may certainly start with this one.  The handy cast list and references to earlier mysteries should keep you from getting lost.  However, I also recommend starting with SILVER PIGS and reading the books in order.  That way you'll get to fully savor the character progression and continuity, not to mention getting more enjoyment out of the books' humor.	2001-01-03

Although Mr.Strickland has done a marvelous job of writing in the voice of John Bellairs and I've enjoyed all of his continuations, they haven't given me the creeps the way Mr. Bellairs' books used to. THE BEAST UNDER THE WIZARD'S BRIDGE has done just that.  Mr. Strickland has taken a brief explanation that Mrs.Zimmermann gave Lewis in THE HOUSE WITH A CLOCK IN ITS WALLS and fleshed it out.  Experienced Lovecraft Fans will recognize which story the author chose to pay tribute to in this adventure.  (It's a story that frightened me terribly 30 years ago, when I was only 16.)  They'll also recognize some familiar literary &quot;friends&quot; when the Capharnaum County Magicians Society meets to discuss the threat.  Even if you're not a Lovecraft fan, you should feel at least a touch of fear when you discover what the late Mr. Gorey depicted on the front cover. The villains, starting with old Jebediah Clabbernong, are as evil as villains in a horror book should be.  (What Jebediah did to ensure himself of living long enough to complete his work is a good clue as to how loathesome he was.  I'm not a bit sorry about what Elihu did to him by having that bridge built.) There were several twists I didn't see coming in this one.  Certainly Uncle Jonathan's backyard illusion was like no other.  The implications in chapter 10 made me feel so grossed out that I barely took in the dreadful danger Lewis and Rita were in.  Yes, the book is a little too short for the big battle at the end.  I would think that the enormous popularity of the thick Harry Potter books would make publishers realize that children in this series' intended age group DON'T need to have books kept to 150 pages or so to maintain their interest.  As a fat reader, I object to having fat Uncle Jonathan described as &quot;heavyset&quot;.  Such euphemisms just reinforce the idea that being fat is wrong.  I'm also not pleased that Rose Rita's description is so neutral.  I was a homely teenager and I remember how pleased I was whenever I found a book in which the heroine was at least plain.  It made me feel hope that a girl didn't have to be cute, pretty, or beautiful to have adventures or do well.  Those citicisms aside, I heartily recommend this book.	2001-01-01
US	52640067	R23GJNXPQILEFL	0813509122	801889205	The Hall-Mills Murder Case: The Minister and the Choir Singer	Books	4	8	13	N	N	A [Mostly] Matter-of-Fact Look at an Unsolved Mystery	In chapter eight of THE RIGHT TO DIE by Rex Stout, Nero Wolfe is reading this book on his assistant's recommendation.  To quote Archie Goodwin, &quot;At dinner we discussed it and agreed that the New York Police Department and district attorney's office had never made such an awful mess of a case and never would.&quot;  Whether or not you think that these world-famous fictional detectives thought too well of the NYPD and D.A.'s office, after reading this book you'll probably agree that the case was seriously bungled.    For those of you who have never heard of it, on 14 September 1922, an Episcopal minister named Edward Wheeler Hall and one of his choir singers, Eleanor Reinhardt [Mrs. James F.] Mills, were murdered.  His rich widow and her brothers, Willie and Henry Stevens, were tried for the crime.  The chief witness against them was Mrs. Gibson, known as &quot;the Pig Woman&quot;, who was poor.  They were acquitted.  Charlotte Mills, the older daughter of the choir singer is quoted as crying bitterly, &quot;I am not surprised.  Money can buy anything.&quot;      Was this a case of money sparing the guilty from having to pay for their crime?  Or was this something worse, three innocent people on trial for their lives while the killers stayed free?      Think about it:  you're married.  Whether or not you love your spouse isn't the issue.  Your spouse is cheating on you and doesn't even have the decency to be discreet about it.  Your town has been gossiping about the affair for some time.  Then your spouse and partner in adultery are found murdered.  You didn't do it.  You're trying to hang on to your dignity while you're being hounded by the media.  The killer(s) aren't found.  The case is finally dropped and you're trying to get on with your life.  Then, almost exactly four years after the double murder, you and one of your bothers are arrested for the murder you didn't commit.  Later, your other brother is arrested.  You've been a respectable and law-abiding citizen, but now that's stripped away from you.  You're in prison for months.  You have to spend big bucks on legal counsel to save yourself and your bothers, whose only crime is being your brothers.  Your good name, no matter that you were acquitted, will have mud clinging to it for the rest of your life because the true killers have never been found.     Quite a nightmare, isn't it?  Is that what happened to Mrs. Hall and the Stevens?    Although more modern cases have proved the author's statements that the defendents were not the sort of characters who would commit such a crime is nonsense, Mr. Kunstler does make out a good case in their favor.  I appreciated the historical references because they help to place the crime in context.  This can be very important to understanding a historical case.  I remember flubbing a big clue in an old fictional mystery because I forgot that the device in question wasn't capable then of what its successors can do today.  The modern reader needs to keep in mind what could and couldn't be done back then.  Similarly, you need to keep in mind what society was like then so you won't find yourself wondering why Mrs. Hall didn't just divorce her husband and have her lawyer make sure Reverend Hall would never get a cent of her money.            The supressed evidence that was in the defendants' favor was interesting.  So was the rest of chapter 29, in which the author offers his solution to the crime.     If there is one thing I really, really hate in true crime writing, it's an author who writes the thoughts of the persons involved as if they were quotations when there is no way those thoughts could be known.  You won't find that here, thank God.  In fact, if you like your true crime served up as if it were a combination of tabloid and sensation novel, you're likely to find this book disappointing.  What sensation is in it comes from the case itself.      I have not seen the primary sources on this case, so I don't know if Mr. Kunstler's book is as factual and well considered, or his speculations at the end as reasonable as they struck me, but that's the way I like my true crime presented.  If that's the way you feel about true crime books, you should read this one.	2000-12-30

I'm not saying that he deserved to die, but had this book been published in 2000 instead of 1964, Mr. Ashby would have cost Mercer's Bobbins a fortune in sexual harassment lawsuits.  It's the second victim whose blood cries to Heaven for justice.  When Wolfe reveals the reason the second victim died, I trust that you will be as angry as I was. As Archie Goodwin tells us, Wolfe would rather miss a meal that have anyone think he's a softy.  Do not miss Mr. Wolfe's attempt to explain that he solved this case NOT for the sake of his loyal bootblack but for far less admirable reasons.  As usual, Inspector Cramer's and Wolfe's remarks about each other are a treat.  Persons who collect stories where there is a lawyer who is portrayed as honorable instead of a self-serving human roach with no interest in justice will want this one because Nathanial Parker, Wolfe's lawyer, has a speaking part.  &quot;MURDER IS CORNY&quot;:  I have no tears to shed for Ken Faber, either.  For those of you who were born after the Sexual Revolution, what he was doing was a particularly vicious form of slander for that period.  (Why Susan MacLeod didn't just go to a doctor and come out triumphantly waiting a certificate or two that proved Faber a liar beats me.  It might have saved a couple of lives.)  As for which of the suspects did the deed, except for Susan herself and Archie (whom she brainlessly gets into trouble), all are men who love Susan.  Those of you who bother to cook might want to find out if Wolfe's corn on the cob recipe is as delicious as learning how Wolfe Saves Archie from a murder rap and reveals the true killer.  Personally, I found the concept of &quot;born come-on&quot;, which Archie assures us that Susan has and isn't aware she has, rather unnerving.  &quot;BLOOD WILL TELL&quot;:  This one starts out with a minor mystery -- who sent Archie the stained tie (is or isn't that stain blood?) and later calls asking Archie to burn it.  Naturally, Archie chooses to investigate instead.  This is why he's on the scene when an adulteress' bloodied corpse is found.  I found this story the most fun of the three because Archie became increasingly frustrated at being left in the dark and Wolfe assumed that Archie should have been able to figure things out for himself.  Will you spot the clues that enabled Wolfe to know that Kirk didn't kill his wife or, as did Archie and this reader, will you have to feel DUMB when they're revealed?  Continuity nitpickers may feel free to pounce on the big error Mr. Stout made in chapter 6, where Archie claims this is the first time he ever saw a man slap another man.  Even if you wish to argue that, technically, Archie didn't see himself slap that uppity jerk in THE RED BOX; how could Goodwin of the Matchless Memory possibly forget the sight of his boss slapping the insufferable Inspector Ash's face in THE SILENT SPEAKER?<br />Even if the reading of these mysteries is no more than adequate, that's enough to recommend this book to those who need the audio version or those facing hideously tedious car trips/waits at the airport.  For those who prefer the print version, you might want to try Amazon.com's Z-shops or their sister company, Bibliofind.&quot;born come-on&quot;, which Archie assures us that Susan has and isn't aware she has, rather unnerving.  &quot;BLOOD WILL TELL&quot;:  This one starts out with a minor mystery -- who sent Archie the stained tie (is or isn't that stain blood?) and later calls asking Archie to burn it.

The descriptions of the excesses of the crime scene mansion are a hoot.  (My favorite is the dragon.)  There's some good, old-fashioned examples of the follies of youth hitting one hard in later life.  Although some of our usual cast are relegated to mere cameo appearances, at least they haven't been forgotten.      The dominant emotion Annie and Max have to worry about facing is that well-known member of the seven deadly sins, GREED.  Greed proves quite deadly, too.  What an appropriate choice for a murder set in today's Christmas season.      Don't miss the spiritualist's rationalization about his career -- it's a quite interesting, though not exactly convincing, whitewash job.    Cat lovers will no doubt enjoy the antics of Agatha and Dorothy L. and cat haters will find more reason to confirm their sad choice to remain catless.    Clues and red herrings are sprinkled throughout like nuts in fudge.  I'm a bit ticked that the author successfully conned me into thinking that my first choice for the killer was wrong.  However, I feel no shame in getting only the last of the contest pictures on target because I hadn't read three of the others. (Number three I recognized as belonging to the series for whom my own feline menace is named, but not which one.) Consider this a Christmas treat that you may enjoy without calories (unless you like to nibble while you read) and sink your teeth in.    The dustjacket isn't ugly and Agatha clawing the &quot;G&quot; in &quot;Sugarplum&quot; keeps it from being too dull.  However, with that delightfully overblown mansion and some intriguing visual opportunities, such as the Murder in the Maze, it's a shame that the designer and illustrators chose not to take advantage of them.	2000-12-10
US	52640067	R23M9JVX5TAY0P	0312865090	995556910	Heartlight	Books	5	7	9	N	N	A Fitting End	It's good to have read the other reviews before writing this one, because a couple of them confirmed what I had suspected -- that some references were to books that I haven't read yet. Although much of the action in HEARTLIGHT takes place before GHOSTLIGHT, WITCHLIGHT, and GRAVELIGHT, part takes place after these, so it should be read last.  (Alternatively, you could start with HEARTLIGHT and save chapter 24 through the end of until after you've read the other three.)      This book didn't seem overlong to me.  I started late yesterday morning and continued reading even though I didn't finish until after midnight and I had to fight off the effects of three nights of too-little sleep.  I wanted to learn more about the mysterious Colin MacLauren who was alluded to in the other volumes.  I liked seeing younger versions of characters I'd met already, even though I felt a bit as I did when I saw &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; after having seeing the three &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies that were made first although they take place later -- sorry because I knew the sad outcomes for some of those characters.     MacLauren's various battles with Evil didn't make me feel that they were too repetitious.  I would expect someone in his line of work to have to go through more than one such battle in his lifetime.  I think there's enough variation in the details.     In a way, it's a shame that this book came out before the shambles that is the final USA Presidential election of the 20th century -- it's fun to speculate how that might have been worked in with the other historical events and overall plot.     Random comments:  (Chapter one) 1956 was the 6th decade of the 20th century, not the 5th.  This is a common mistake that I shared until reading about various decades of life in my library's medical journals forced me to work it out.  Your first decade of life is from zero [birth] through age 10.  Your second is from ages 11 through 20, and so on.  It's the same with each century.  By the same reasoning, the first century AD was from zero through 100, the second from 101 through 200, and so on.  The 20th century is called that because it began in 1901 and will end on 31 December 2000.  That is why this book is correct in stating that the real turn of the millennium is 2,000, not 1999.  (Chapter 4)  I'm not sure if it's true, but I read somewhere that President Kennedy screwed up his German and actually told the people of Berlin that he was a [jelly?] doughnut.   Given Toller's secret, I don't feel at all bad about what Colin does to him.  In fact, I thought our hero's guilty feelings were excessive.  Simon's dreadful accident didn't seem so horrifying after finding out what he had done earlier.  (Chapter 16) If MacLauren's birthday is February 2nd, then he was born on Candlemas, the old celebration of the purification of the Virgin Mary -- any symbolic significance?  I thought that &quot;elide&quot; into all the other late-night emergency calls of Colin's life bit was a typo for &quot;slide&quot;, but the word is real.  (Chapter 18)  As I recently learned, the real McCoy is spelled &quot;Wedgwood&quot;, not &quot;Wedgewood,&quot; so that heirloom plate may not have been so valuable.  (Chapter 19)  MacLauren's guilt seems even more senseless after reading his self reminders about persons of the Light who turn to the Dark.  Chapters 22 and 23 are a real treat for the Lovecraft fan.  Also, the description of the old Lattimer house delighted me because it made me think of Jackson's Hill house.  I assume that the old TV Show Barnabas Sally named the cat for was Barnabas Collins of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;.   The one aspect of MacLauren's beliefs that I found truly offensive was that before we are reborn, each of us choses the suffering we deal with in our current lives.  To me that sounds like the ultimate in &quot;blame the victim&quot; mentality.  However, I acknowledge that my viewpoint might be different if I were a true believer in reincarnation.      HEARTLIGHT is not a book for those seeking easy entertainment, but I think readers looking for something to sink their mental teeth into will find it very rewarding.	2000-11-26

I've never gotten around to reading my copy of MISTS OF AVALON, so I won't be making comparisons.  My previous acquaintance with Ms. Bradley's writing was with her earlier Darkover novels.      Yes, Truth is almost as annoying as The X-Files' Scully when it comes to denying the existence of magic.  Yes, Truth often acts about as dim-witted as many gothic romance heroines were back when heroines were expected to be innocent and helpless. Yes, there were times when I wanted to reach into the book and shake her and scream out the obvious truths she was missing, but...     This was still a gripping novel.  I didn't suspect the whole truth about Thorne Blackburn's fate.  I loved the house and its grounds.  The occult trappings were very interesting.  The characters came alive for me and I found myself impatiently waiting for each new twist to be revealed.       One final note:  My compliments to Carol Russo and Mark Hess.  I LOVE a cover that accurately portrays the characters and surroundings in the book.  Don't let its beautiful serenity fool you.  This book is far from serene.	2000-11-25
US	52640067	R1ORXZRILV7B8D	042512892X	488722567	Into the Darkness	Books	5	13	14	N	N	A Gem of a Mystery	Whether the author is writing as &quot;Barbara Michaels&quot; or as &quot;Elizabeth Peters&quot;, you are likely to get strong and interesting characters.  At heart, this mystery has a lot in common with the gothic romances I read in my youth (except that the heroine's grandfather was popular instead of universally hated by the villagers).  I enjoyed the painless lessons on jewels (particularly since I also find diamonds boring).  Heroine Meg has four men to consider:  Nick, her current boyfriend from New York; Cliff, her handsome stepcousin; Darren, the old schoolmate become family lawyer; and the aloof, mysterious Riley, widely believed to have murdered his benefactor, Meg's grandfather.  The old hand at gothic romances will be looking for the clues that will spell out which of these men is the blackguard in disguise -- and will probably still be surprised in the end. There's a Old Family Scandal that needs to be revisited, a housekeeper who loves to play the roles of certain famous fictional housekeepers (including the infamous Mrs. Danvers), an old-fashioned gentlewoman of a grandmother, and a treat of a cat (unless you're a cat-hater).  There are other characters with their own stories and personalities.  I'll leave you to make their acquaintance in your own good time. Notes:  Meg's grandfather's opinion to the contrary, it takes courage to seek therapy.  It takes more courage to try again if the first professional you turn to doesn't work out.  For those who have read many of the author's books under both names, I should explain that INTO THE DARKNESS is really in the Elizabeth Peters style so they won't read this book with the wrong expectations, as I did.	2000-11-24

Biscombe is a great place to read about, but I don't think it's safe to visit there. These stories combine that good old science fiction trait of making you think about things you thought you knew in a different way with the chill of the supernatural.  Until I read &quot;No Truce With Kings,&quot; I'd never realized that we citizens of the USA should have a more sympathetic view of Oliver Cromwell than I learned from my history classes and books.  If I thought that what goes on in &quot;Let the Train Take the Strain&quot; were true, I'd be terrified to drive my car again.  On the other hand, I'm sorry that &quot;Rollover Night&quot; isn't true.  What a show!  You'll meet with an interesting modern look at an ancient profession in &quot;Canterbury's Dilemma&quot; (No, thank you, Mr. Fersen). &quot;Oh, I do Like to be Beside the Seaside (Within Reason)&quot; is another story I firmly hope is purely imaginary because the implications are so dreadful.  &quot;I Could a Tale Unfold&quot; should make you want to know more before you buy that piece of used furniture you have your eye on.  [In the next-to-the-last paragraph of p.164, shouldn't that be &quot;tail&quot; end, not &quot;tale&quot;?] I'd hate to be guilty of writing the poem on p.167!  As for &quot;Up From the Cellar&quot;, it's good to know Mr. Disvan had a reason for putting up with Mr. Oakley all this time (even though the end makes even more interesting by implication the second promise that Mr. Disvan made at the end of &quot;It Has Been Said&quot; and what Mr. Oakley thought he saw on p.56 of &quot;Rollover Night&quot;).  I'm sorry that Mr. Whitbourn won't be writing the stories that he describes at the end of the book, but it was nice of him to scatter these crumbs for his readers.  He certainly succeeded in leaving me wanting more.	2000-11-24

Some I saw coming and some  I didn't.  &quot;Grandma Gert&quot; is a nice addition to the &quot;Holy  Terror&quot; school of formidable elders.  The author asks our forgiveness  for not setting this story in New Kassel, but I don't think there's  anything to forgive.  The West Virginia setting was just as interesting as  the unfolding of another less-than-ordinary chapter in the lives of Torie's  ancestors. The information about a certain use for quilts was new to me and  welcome.  I hope this isn't the last we'll see of cousin Elliot. RANDOM  COMMENTS:  Actually, considering what happens to your body when you die,  sitting on the toilet might not be the worst place to be if your plane  should crash.  I, for one, don't think Torie should forgive her  stepfather-to-be until he clears her record.  Colin should write to her car  insurance company and the department of motor vehicles [if they still have  the incident on record] and admit that Torie didn't deserve that ticket.   He should also pay Torie every penny of the difference that ticket  undoubtedly made in her insurance rates during those years.  It's not  enough to apologize if you've wronged someone.  You need to make  reparation.  All right, I'll admit I'm frequently shocked by what coworkers  in their teens and 20s don't know about American history, but Torie is in  her 30s.  Weren't they still teaching about miners and the horrible  conditions under which they worked when she was in school?  Didn't she ever  ask an adult what the line &quot;I owe my soul to the company store&quot;  in Tennessee Ernie Ford's &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot; meant?  I would have  expected her to nod and let the speaker go on talking.  I do hope Torie's  car has vinyl seats instead of cloth.	2000-09-05

I haven't seen the film yet, but I  expect to enjoy it based on what I've seen in these pages.  Yes, the  writing is a bit awkward.  Although my Japanese isn't very good, I know  enough to be able to say that Japanese and English can be very different in  the way they express the same thought.  (That's not even counting the way  our cultural differences make some ideas extremely hard to translate  because there is no equivalent in the other culture.)  Don't worry about  the writing.  It's enough to get the story across.   However, I do have one  objection:  the book states that Miyazaki is often called &quot;the Disney  of Japan&quot; without mentioning the other pioneer in Japanese animation  who held that title before him, the late Dr. Osamu Tezuka (who was also  known as the &quot;god of manga&quot;).  It seems a curious omission.  It's  not as if the creator of Astro Boy [Mighty Atom], Kimba the White Lion  [Jungle Emperor], and Dr. Black Jack is unknown in this country.	2000-09-04

Certainly he doesn't spend any time worrying about  how to get back to the future if the jig is up.  (If he's so smart, why  hasn't he had the good sense to change his name as needed through the  centuries?)  I wish the author hadn't used the word &quot;teased&quot; when  she did -- it was so inappropriate to the situations that I had trouble  believing in Segalla.  &quot;Jested&quot; would have been a better choice.   Part of my problem with this book is that I was raised mostly on Victorian  and early 20th century-through World War II books.  We didn't have much  money and those books were just &quot;old junk&quot; then.  I have the  styles of those periods engraved in my brain.  If a modern author wants me  to feel &quot;transported into the past&quot;, s/he needs to get the  &quot;feel&quot; of the period.  For me, Ms. Dukthas failed.  Her solution  really bothered me because there was no actual bibliography appended.  What  an author does with the characters s/he invented is his/her own business.   If you're going to write a novel based on actual history, I think it only  decent to try to portray figures of history as close to life as can be  known of them.  I know that if I were ever to become involved in what would  become a famous unsolved mystery, I'd hate to have someone twist my  character to fit his/her theory.  I finished FEVER SEASON by Barbara Hambly  last night and I appreciated the afterword in which she explained about the  historical events used in her book.  I'd have felt much better about this  story had Ms. Dukthas done the same.  However, if you aren't picky about  the nuances of the English language and have no scruples toward the  possibly unjust blackening of the name of someone who isn't aliveto fight  back, you should be able to enjoy this novel without the reservations that  I have.	2000-08-24

It was my childhood introduction to several famous mysteries.  If you're looking for  wild speculation, this is not the book for you.  Although some of the  author's remarks would not pass the &quot;political correctness test&quot;  today, on the whole he took a sensible/skeptical look at his subjects.   Those mysteries are:  Count Konigsmark, the ladies who believed that they  had walked back in time and saw Marie Antoinette, Amy Robsart, Prince  Albert's father, was it Jeanne d'Arc [Joan of Arc] who was burned at the  stake?, Barabbas, the Mayas, the treasure of the Tuamatos, the lost  Dutchman's Mine, the sacred treasures of the Temple of Jerusalem, Flavius  Josephus, Golgotha's location, Amelia Earhart, the 1959 Siberian explosion,  Mayerling, the Lost Tribes of Israel, the two children who died in the  train wreck at Charfield in 1928, Father Borynski's disappearance, Peter  Ney, Thomas Charles Druce, Victor Grayson, Commander Crabb, the Shroud of  Turin, Borley Rectory, the Englishwoman's mother vanishes from their hotel,  the Trodmore Hunt Steeplechase, the Russian Reinforcements rumor of 1914,  the race horse called Tetrarch [this one I didn't believe], the Devil at  South Devon, Brendan the Navigator, Glamis, the moving coffins in the Chase  family vault, and &quot;Pattee's Caves&quot; in North Salem, New Hampshire.   The book includes a bibliography and an index.  The artist(s?) for the  black and white illustrations are not listed, but some of them bear the  name &quot;Eisner&quot;.  The name on the front of the dustjacket is  &quot;J. Berger&quot;.  Do I still find the book interesting?  Last week I  meant only to reread the chapter on a mystery that was the basis for a  novel I had just read.  I finally (and reluctantly) put it down because it  was getting too late for a worknight.	2000-08-24

I usually don't like the art in the Buffy comic so I've been avoiding the paperback compilations.  Last night I  decided I might as well read it.   &quot;White Christmas&quot; I rather  liked because it showed poor Buffy dealing with an unpleasant financial  consequence of the slaying business.  Buffy and Giles' conversation on  fashion made me chuckle.  I had a part-time job with McDonald's when I was  in college, so I understand Buffy's feelings about her uniform and goofy  hat.  The reason behind Mr. Richter's dedication to the freezer was, if  you'll pardon the pun, chilling.  The fight scenes weren't bad and the last  panel was cute. &quot;Happy New Year&quot; was my least favorite among the  three stories in this book.  It had some good lines (loved Cordelia with  the crossbow), but it was spoiled by a glaring error and a shallow end.  I  realize that Andi Watson is British, but more careful research would have  turned up the fact that witches weren't burned in this country.  (Besides,  according to Russell Hope Robbins is correct in his ENCYCLOPEDIA OF  WITCHCRAFT AND DEMONOLOGY [if memory serves me correctly], accused witches  were normally strangled and their bodies were burned.  Only those brave  enough to proclaim their innocence on the way to the stake were burned  alive.)   &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot; was pretty good.  Although it  turned out to be a good thing that Xander crashed the slumber party, shame  on him for doing it.  It was an interesting trap.  Some of the dialog was  funny, and I enjoyed the creative excuse for the damages. If you collect  the comic and missed some issues, (or you don't have them because you came  late to the series) you'll definitely want this book.  Otherwise, it's a  &quot;nice to have&quot;, not a &quot;must have.&quot;<br />RANDOM COMMENTS:   I'm glad I caught the &quot;...PEARE&quot; on Angel's volume when he was  reading those romantic words aloud to Buffy because I was thinkingit might  be from Donne.  [I majored in history, not English, OK?]  If you're  curious, Angel is reading from Act II, Scene II of &quot;Romeo and  Juliet.&quot;  The lines in the first two panels are Juliet's. They're  Romeo's in the last two.   I'm not going to call this book a &quot;graphic  novel&quot;.  I've been a fan long enough that I remember when that phrase  was chosen in the hopes of getting away from the kiddie image then conjured  up by the term &quot;comic book.&quot;  What I don't remember is if the  people who chose that term realized that it already existed.  It's a polite  way to say a novel contains explicit sex scenes.  &quot;Univited  Guests&quot; is neither a novel nor does it have sex scenes.	2000-08-15
US	52640067	R3K6P1H4JF8N08	0405081413	57959933	The five jars (Supernatural and occult fiction)	Books	4	23	23	N	N	Finally Got to Read It After Waiting Over 30 Years	I can't comment on the illustrations in the original edition because I  have only the Ash Tree Press edition.  According to the introduction, the  main character is obviously meant to be M.R. James himself.  I believe it.   The same introduction suggests that &quot;After Dark on the Playing  Fields&quot; from THE COLLECTED GHOST STORIES OF M.R. JAMES is related to  this story.  (I reread that story after reading this book and agree that  it's possible.)   This book is not the same as those famous ghost stories  because it was meant for children.  That doesn't mean that it doesn't have  its chilling moments.  Our hero has some close calls I certainly would  prefer to avoid.    The five jars of the title contain magic ointments  which endow our narrator with special abilities that should be familiar to  fairy tale fans.  Evil creatures try to prevent him from using all of the  different bottles and so making them his own.  Unfortunately, you can't use  more than one a night.       As he uses the ointments, the middle-aged hero  is more and more able to interact with animals and the invisible world.   (Cat lovers will be amused to learn what cats are REALLY saying.)  Even  though his abilities are limited at first, they're enough to help our hero  recognize that he's under attack.  The discerning reader may have a shudder  or two at the implications of the way so many of the evil spirits (or  whatever they were) were able to assume a normal and friendly appearance.   The bat ball attack was pretty good (even though, unlike Mr. James, I'm  fond of bats).      This story manages to combine charm with a touch of  scariness.  The introduction suggested that the reason it hasn't stayed in  print the way his ghost stories have is because this story would have been  considered TOO scary by parental standards when it was written.  Well,  times have changed.  Today's children have routine access to much scarier  stuff.     If you love M.R. James' work, you'll want this book.Considering what THE FIVE JARS costs when you can find a used copy online,  readers who aren't James fanatics would do well to badger for a nice modern  paperback edition.  (I hope there will be one.  My nice reason is so others  may enjoy this story.  My selfish reason is that I want it to have the  original illustrations so I can see more than a scanned copy of &quot;The  Bat Ball&quot;.  I can't afford the Arnold edition.)	2000-08-12

One of the nice things about this book is that the author took care to include only  those games that require no special equipment or boards, you still have  hope of finding the boards, or can be played with cards/household objects.   There are games for children, for adults, and for the family.  The back has  a special section on fun forfeits for those who lose.<br />   If you also  remember long summer car trips to see relatives back when you were a child,  I'm sure you remember being horribly bored -- and fighting with your  brothers and sisters (if you had any).  Today's parents should appreciate  the fact that some of these games can be played in the car.  Even better,  none of them require batteries and the word games CAN'T be broken or  lost!<br />   The physical games can use of some of that unfair energy  advantage children have.  The word and [most] card games let the players  exercise their wits.  Some of them are very silly.  With any luck, they'll  make you forget your stress and start laughing.<br />   If you love old books,  as I do, this is a handy reference for looking up forgotten games mentioned  in them.  Sometimes you may have the fun of realizing that a  &quot;modern&quot; game is just a slight variation or revival of a very old  game.<br />   Whether you're interested in how people entertained themselves  before electronic entertainment was born, trying to find some inexpensive  fun for the children that doesn't involve pretending to kill, or ideas for  party games, I recommend trying to locate a copy.	2000-07-28
US	52640067	R21PEPPSHCHKP1	0671041754	788917768	Immortal  (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Certainly Kept Me Reading	I had high expectations for this novel because I'd read the authors' other Buffy novels and consider them the best writers for our Slayer's non-TV adventures.  I appreciate the trouble they take to keep the characters in  character and to write dialog that I could believe they would say.  Unlike  some of the other reviewers, I was not surprised that Buffy is still in  high school instead of college as she has been since the 1999 season  started.  It takes time for authors to write books and time for the  publishers to have them ready to ship to the stores, so I would have been  surprised if late 1999 - early 2000 Buffy books were set in the same time  frame as the most recent episodes.     Veronique is definitely a unique  vampire.  At the same time, she reminds me of a number of SF/fantasy TV  villains who serve more powerful villains.  After all, she was granted her  version of immortality in order to do the Triumvirate's bidding, and she's  been failing to fulfill her part of the bargain for over 1500 years.  Her  nervousness about failing yet again -- not to mention that over 100 years  of helplessness thanks to the ingenuity of an earlier Slayer -- is credible  and understandable.  It's not as if she could file a grievance against her  employers for anything they do to punish her.     The historical flashbacks  add depth to Veronique, necessary background information, and are very  interesting in themselves.       Anyone who has ever been torn between  family and duty will understand how Buffy feels when her mother's life and  the entire world are in danger at the same time.       The more we learn  about the Triumvirate, the more frightening they become.  The final  revelation was absolutely horrifying in its implications.  The final battle  would have been quite spectacular seen on the big or small screen.  It's  probably a good thing for Veronique that she doesn't have much time to  regret her final mistake, because the consequences were ghastly.     Randomcomments:  I was puzzled when Pepper mentioned &quot;The Seven Chinese  Brothers&quot; because it sounded like &quot;The Five Chinese  Brothers&quot;.  I thought the authors might have made a mistake, but I  checked Amazon.com and there is a version with seven brothers.  Angel's  mention of the card game Faro on p.52 made me smile.  I'm an old fan of  Georgette Heyer's [intentionally] funny Regency Romances, so I knew that  was an authentic detail.  (In case you're not familiar with the period  called &quot;Regency&quot;, it lasted from 1811-1820, when King George III  of England was permanently insane, so his son was regent.  Since Angel is  Irish and over 200 years old, I'd expect him to remember Faro.  By the way,  according to my library's big Webster's, the name might be derived from  &quot;pharoah&quot;.)  Because I've read both the Gatehouse Trilogy and  CHILD OF THE HUNT, I was pleased to see the return of the ghost roads and  Lucy Hanover.  Loved having Willow called by Underdog's girlfriend's name.   Buffy's eyes have been described as blue and hazel in other books.  This  time they're brown.  I think every Buffy novel writer should be given a  handout with each of the show's characters' physical details.  That Leah,  an oncologist, is a smoker was ironic.  The description of the wrinkles  around her mouth (caused by her long-time cigarette habit) was another  authentic detail.  I was feeling really sorry for Slayer Angela when I got  to page 170, but then I read the top of p.171 and snickered nastily at her  Watcher.  (The late 20th century Watchers Council's loss of Buffy in the  third season seems even more stupid after reading about how the 19th  century Watchers lost Angela.  Some groups just don't learn.)  The  conversation about Frankenstein was funny even though I already knew what  Angel knew.  Interesting that Buffy assumed that Angel would go on after  she died instead of walking into the sunrise.  That Veronique chose the San  Rafael cemetaryis another bit of irony because Saint [Archangel] Raphael  is a healer.  Laughed out loud at Xander's very telling observation about  Crestwood.  I wish Giles had asked Buffy if she'd asked that nurse to give  her the details about her mother's illness before he passed judgment.  I  don't think the American Nurses Association would be very pleased with the  mostly negative depiction of nurses in this book.  In case you were  wondering, the &quot;Valley Fever&quot; that is one possible diagnosis for  Buffy's mother is a real disease.  It's also called coccidioidomycosis.   It's common here in the Southwest.  Luckily, severe cases aren't so common.   What happened to Mrs. Summers because she wasn't more aggressive about  getting medical care is good cautionary tale.  Buffy feeling like a child  at the prospect of losing her mother was realistic.  I was 46 when my  mother died last year and for awhile I felt like a lost child.  Don't  bother waiting for someone to point out that the Triumvirate are an Unholy  Trinity.  Unless I missed it, no one did.  Perhaps the authors thought that  would be disrespectful.  I didn't like the way they depicted the Empress  Theodora.  I also didn't like having Veronique be behind kicking the Jews  out of France and the ruin of the Templars.  Plain old human greed, envy,  prejudice, and corruption were more than adequate reasons.  Don't let  historical evil off the hook.  On the whole, though, this is a marvelous  adventure.	2000-07-28
US	52640067	RW99QJMYOZVMJ	067089205X	936954833	Bridesmaid Revisited (Ellie Haskell Mysteries)	Books	5	9	11	N	N	Dorothy Cannell Hasn't Lost Her Touch	Although I seldom read Gothics anymore, I read my share of them when I was young.  Ms. Cannell serves up the standards:  deep dark family secrets (one was easy to guess, but the others took me completely by surprise), great  wrongs from the past that need to be set right, people being killed because  they either KNOW TOO MUCH or could unwittingly REVEAL ALL.  She didn't  leave out the less-than-warm welcome the villagers give the innocent  heroine.  There's a seance!  There's a governess who wanted her master who  had the invalid wife.  Ellie's life is mysteriously threatened.  There's  even a certain architectural feature no Gothic romance should be without.   Of course, Ellie isn't the usual Gothic heroine because she's a wife and  mother, but our author handles this trifling problem by packing Bentley and  the kiddies off to camp.  Mrs. Malloy and the faithful Tobias are similarly  disposed of, leaving poor Ellie on her own.  To trust or not to trust?  Not  only is that the question, but the answer could mean life or death to  Ellie.  I don't know if I'd go so far as to say that it's the best spoof of  Gothics since Jane Austen's NORTHANGER ABBEY, but it's certainly a lot of  fun. RANDOM COMMENTS:  If you take 100 years as the human life span, then  ages 34 through 65 are the middle, so yes, you are middle aged if you're in  your forties (I will be 46 this year).  Laughed at Mrs. Malloy's reaction  to the reason Ellie has never spoken of her maternal grandmother.  The  chapter decorations are pretty.  For someone who reads Gothics, Ellie took  a bit long to become suspicious.  I'd never heard the phrase &quot;a friend  of Dorothy&quot; before -- what a polite way to explain.  My instinctive  reaction to the mentions of meat puddings and fish pie was YUCK! Then I  remembered the teasing I gave a friend who refused to try chicken pot pie  because &quot;pies are dessert!&quot; and decided to keep an open mind.   With all the revelations in this book, Ellie and her kin are going to have  to rethink their precise degree of relationship.  I, for one, hope that Ms.  Cannell doesn't fail to give us vain Vanessa's reaction in the next book.   I'm sorry that Yan Nascimbene chose to give us a dustjacket illustration  that's in keeping with the punny title.  This book cries out for a  traditional Gothic cover, preferably a nightgowned Ellie fleeing the Old  Rectory in the pitch dark; with one window mysteriously lit in the  forbidding house.	2000-07-23
US	52640067	RE49C9VO43BOT	0140383956	633090626	The Saturdays (Melendy Family)	Books	5	56	61	N	N	Explaining Dumb Crambo	My original review was written 14 July 1998.  This is an addition for readers (and potential readers) who are (or would be) as puzzled as I once was when the book said the Melendy children played a noisy game of  &quot;Dumb Crambo&quot;.  Over 20 years after I first read THE SATURDAYS, I  was lucky enough to get a copy of VICTORIAN PARLOUR GAMES by Patrick Beaver  that includes it.<br />   To paraphrase, in Dumb Crambo, the players are split  evenly into two teams.  One team leaves the room while the remaining team  chooses a verb.  When the first team comes back in, the second team tells  them another verb that rhymes with the first verb.  The first team must  guess the secret verb by acting it out.  For example [not the one given],  if the secret verb is &quot;fly&quot;, the first team might be told  &quot;try&quot;.  If they guess it's &quot;spy&quot;, they act out someone  spying on someone else.  If they're wrong, the second team hisses them.   The first team keeps trying until they act out the right verb.<br />     It's  called &quot;dumb crambo&quot; because it's a variation of a game called  &quot;crambo.&quot;  In the original, only one person leaves the room and  any kind of word may be chosen.  The guesser is still told a word that  rhymes with the secret word.  The trick is that you have to ask questions  that might get you the secret word WITHOUT naming the word you're guessing.   For instance, if you think the secret word is &quot;bus&quot;, you might  ask &quot;Is it a big ground vehicle that carries a lot of  passengers?&quot;<br />    I think it shows something of the personalities and  intelligence of the Melendy children that they would enjoy Dumb Crambo.	2000-07-23

Given Diego's thoughts before he falls under the spell of the mirror, I couldn't summon up a drop of pity for his ugly fate.  Besides, he was supposed to die  horribly to set the stage, like all those unknowns in the teasers for  &quot;The X-Files&quot; episodes.  As such, he did his job.     Early on we  have a brave history teacher who knows the deadly threat the mirror poses  and is prepared to risk everything to end that threat.  Does he stand a  chance?  Is his name Buffy?     We are given plenty of hints that Dr.  Blaine is a pompous jerk before he even shows up, and the obnoxious doctor  lives down to his billing.  I'm a little sorry that the author didn't write  the details of the scene where the Mayor takes the doctor down a peg  because it would have been fun to read.  Does Blaine deserve what happens  to him?  You decide.      Before the book reaches its climax, the Scooby  Gang and assorted extras will be subjected to the mirror's power.  It's  interesting to see why some sucumb and some hold firm.        I've been  interested in the Aztecs since I first read an article about them in  &quot;National Geographic many years ago, so I liked the glimpses into  Aztec life and religion.        Of course we know that all of the regulars  have to come out of this alive, so there was absolutely no suspense over  Buffy's prophetic dream about Angel.  However, I thought the author picked  an ingenious way out.  Certainly the scenes of everyone trying to escape  destruction would have looked good on the show.  (I laughed aloud at the  crack about the &quot;USS Banquet Table&quot;).  Similarly, knowing what  was to come in the episodes added a little spice to Cordelia's bragging  about Stanford and Mr. Trick's assumption that he'll last through the ages.      I had no trouble believing in Dem.  I was amused by the way he saw  Giles as creepy and laughed heartily at the chapter where Dem puts two and  two together and gets one.  I wasn't disappointed by his fate.       I'd  rate this a good adventure.       Random comments:  Except for p.111, every  mention of Angelus is incorrectly spelled &quot;Angeles&quot;.  Why?          Loved having the author remember that Giles goes for jelly doughnuts.      Was even happier to see the correct date for the 3rd millenium [01 Jan  2001] given.       The end of chapter three was quite spooky.     Chuckled  at Buffy's imaginings about Giles dealing with Ms. Frank, who looks so much  like his lost Jenny, on p.125.     The description of Cordelia's fighting  method was good, too.     It may be only a coincidence about scientist Lucy  Frank's name, but in the late 18th-early 19th century there was an  improving book for children called HARRY AND LUCY by the Edgeworths.  Their  daughter continued their work and a boy named Frank was added.     It was  nice to see Joyce in the swing of things.	2000-07-18
US	52640067	R2ERX0GHRZPI5L	0671021346	433664474	Blooded (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Book 5)	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Definitely one of the better ones	I've been reading Buffy books for the last few weeks.  The best of them combined a good story and an accurate depiction of the characters, as this one does.  The action sometimes switches from present day Sunnydale to  ancient China and Japan as we learn more about the history of the evil  Chinese sorcerer-become-vampire [a DEADLY combination] called Chirayouju  and his great battle against a Japanese mountain god named Summo.  The  flashbacks were quite interesting and fleshed out the long-term foes'  characters.  That made them more than just the menace that shows up at the  climax for the big battle.  Changing time periods wasn't that confusing  because the first sentence or two of the chapters made it clear where and  when you were.  One of the present-day vampire attacks was more confusing  because I had to go back several pages to find the hints that the scene was  in a cemetary instead of the library.  Where would this story fit in the TV  show's timeline?  I don't know and I don't care.  If enough books get  written it will become impossible for them all to have taken place in the  context of the show.  I can live with that.   Random comments:  Loved the  crack about Seven of Nine's wardrobe on p.24  Xander's comments about  Scooby-Doo and the usefulness of Velma over Daphne show more taste than you  might think he has given that he dates Cordelia.  Urk!  Don't even mention  Scrappy-Doo!  That de'Medici curse mentioned in chapter three was quite  nasty.   If not for the fact that he was called that in China, I'd suspect  that &quot;Chirayouju&quot; was what the Japanese called him and his real  name was something else.  It just sounds more Japanese than Chinese.   MOULDY vampires?  Good thing that European vampires don't seem to have that  problem or I couldn't see Angel attracting Buffy!  From what I've read  about the status of females in Asia, I'm really surprised that Chirayouju  didn't feel horribly insulted to be in a female body; let alone be willingto possess a different female.  Enjoyed the nod to Felix the Cat on p.90.   Chuckled at Giles' reaction to Buffy's crisis on p.103  I liked the role  Giles had in this book.  It's no fun when he's just another  &quot;damsel&quot; in distress.  Chirayouju's opinion of Western parenting  fits Sunnydale like a glove.  In this book Buffy's eyes are called blue.   In the last book I read, they were hazel. Is there an overall editor for  these books?  p.139  My Japanese is no more than rudimentary, but I thought  you say &quot;moshi, moshi&quot; when you answer the phone.  I liked the  journal of the early 19th-century watcher and its mention of Lord Byron.   Even in a crisis, Cordelia remains Cordelia.  It's interesting that in  Japan the sun is female and the moon is male, the opposite of Greek-Roman  mythology.  I liked Chirayouju's reactions to the way the world had changed  while he was out of it.  p.190  Uh -- the way the sentence is written, the  Kappa stretched the ropes, not their enemies.  The final battle was  impressive.  I'm glad we were allowed to see the innner struggles as well  as the outer.  I have a problem with the final solution, though.  I would  think that there'd be an international incident unless Japanse Watcher Kobo  has enough clout to get them off the hook.	2000-07-17

I liked the fact that Lori's Prince Charming isn't storybook handsome.  I've loved ghost stories since I was a child, so the supernatural element didn't  bother me.  My second reading was even more special.  I saw my mother only  twice a week.  I knew she wasn't well, but she didn't tell me she had heart  trouble.  I said goodbye to her one night before I went home.  The next  morning my sister called me to tell me she'd died in her sleep.  2 1/2  months later it was the annual Friends of the Tucson-Pima Library used book  sale.  Saturday was my only chance to go, but I woke up not wanting to  bother.  The sale had always been a gala day for my mother and me.  I  couldn't bear the thought of going without her.  When I'm feeling really  sad or sick, I like to reread a gentle or funny book to help me cope.  I'm  glad I chose AUNT DIMITY'S DEATH.  As Lori learns how Aunt Dimity managed  to go on with her life after a devastating blow, I started to feel a little  better.  By the time I was finished, I no longer felt like greying out in  my bed.  I drove to the sale.  It was hard whenever I spotted a book I knew  Mom would have wanted, but I had a nice time. This is a dear book if your  life is going well, but I recommend it as a comfort if you've lost someone  whom you loved.	2000-07-12

I'm glad that girls today have heroines such as Buffy.  I still remember my excitement when I first found an sf [science fiction] book that featured a  heroine instead of a hero.  I was in junior high then.  For much of my  youth the general male reaction was of the &quot;duh, I've never met a girl  science fiction fan before&quot; variety.  I was lucky that women had  already taken over the once all-male career I wanted, librarian.  My older  sister wasn't so lucky.  There were very few women doing her job when she  started and she had to endure harassment before she was accepted.  I'm  giving this background information because I wasn't at all happy with the  way this book ended.  I was getting increasingly upset as I read the book  because the tone reminded me of the way some authors --including female  authors -- made fun of the idea of women's liberation when I was growing  up.  Fortunately, Xander's remark about the womyn's movement and the noble  cause of feminism on pp. 110-11 allowed to me to realize that Ms. Massie  was preaching against taking women's liberation so far that men become  unfairly oppressed, not against gender equality.  I thought her message was  effective.     However, I found myself feeling sorry for the Moon Mom &amp;  daughters even though I wanted them stopped.  (All right, one of the  sisters was probably hopeless.)  I would have preferred to have seen the  Muses and their mother recover a sense of balance by seeing Apollo get his.   I really didn't like the way Ms. Massie chose to portray and deal with  these mythological characters.    Random comments:  BULFINCH'S MYTHOLOGY  helped me get the names right long before Buffy found them out.  I  recommend that route for the impatient.  Page 47, full paragraph 2:   Nadine's year of being sired should be 1864, not 54.  Don't bother  wondering why the vampires don't just leave town until the Muses shlep off.   There's a good reason.  Giles' dialog was even more off than Oz's.  I  couldn't believe in him at all.  P.67, paragraph 2:  Did Buffy  intentionally think &quot;No Moon&quot; instead of &quot;Mo Moon&quot;, or  is that a typo?  The scene with Allison's amethyst ring did a nice job of  showing the extent of the Moon sisters' power over her.  P.73, paragraph 2  -- that should be &quot;slayer mode&quot;, not &quot;slayerette mode&quot;.   Why is Buffy being so imprudent with stakes?  Throwing them instead of  using the same one or two to dust the attacking vampires makes it too easy  for her to run out.  Um, how was Giles supposed to go to the bathroom the  way Buffy was safeguarding him?  A Watcher with diaper rash would be a  crabby Watcher.  Got a good laugh from the Sensitivity Speaker's reaction  to Sunnydale High students.  Buffy's opinion of mimes was worth a chuckle.   P.159, last line:  the &quot;already&quot; needs to be at the end of the  sentence for it to make sense.  Given Mr. Summers' neglect of Buffy on the  show, I found the scene where Buffy's parents are fighting over who gets  her for their weekend plans ringing false.  I don't like it when characters  behave out of character just to get a message across.  Overall, this was an  interesting adventure.  The way the murders were accomplished was  reasonably nasty.  The Moon family's plot was quite chilling and the  solution to fighting a menace that can regenerate was ingenious.  Aside  from the  reservations I've mentioned, I'd recommend this book.	2000-07-10

The author doesn't have a good handle on the characters, but I didn't care.  I've been an H.P. Lovecraft fan since I was 16, so I got a kick out of seeing the middle name of his good friend, Clark  Ashton Smith, showing up, not to mention Giles consulting Eibon (A true  Lovecraftian Evil Old Recluse will have the Book of Eibon amongst his  forbidden tomes collection.  Another of Lovecraft's friends, Robert E.  [Ervin] Howard, is most famous for creating Conan the Barbarian, but he  also created a fanatical Puritan adventurer who fought supernatural  horrors.  The name of that Puritan was Solomon Kane.  That's why I laughed  in delight over the dreams about the Puritan Slayer Samantha Kane and her  Watcher, Robert Erwin.  As a fan of &quot;Kolchak the Night Stalker&quot;  [starring Darrin McGavin] from its first TV run, I chortled with glee when  the even more hapless reporter Darryl MacGovern came on the scene.     Readers who dislike Cotton Mather for his role in the Salem Witch  Mockery-of-Justice will enjoy what happens to him in this book.  Many of  the other character names tease at my memory, but I haven't yet taken the  time to look them up (worse, I left my notes at home!).  Ooh -- almost  forgot to mention how much I enjoyed the Master's dream of &quot;Old  Scratch.&quot;  I found this book a very amusing romp and I suspect other  horror fans will, too.<br />BTW, the scene where Samantha Kane is stalking  after escaped witch Dim[n?]sdale [name from Hawthorne's THE SCARLET  LETTER?], before she's gruesomely attacked by various body parts that  refuse to be slain, it says Kane didn't even have a captor to keep her  company.

Of course Tatsinda would have had no difficulty having her beauty appreciated in the USA.  It  could have been her personal tragedy that she has brown eyes and golden  hair in a land where everyone else has blue eyes and white hair, so she's  considered disfigured.  Tatsinda does not allow the rude opinion of those  around her to sour her personality.  The strength and courage of this  extraordinary young woman are proved in a daring adventure.  In the end,  she is instrumental in changing her community's narrow point of view.   Besides the heroine, I love the wise woman who knew Tatsinda's true worth  before anyone else did.  I also liked the woman's attitude toward people  who wanted to consult her.  I don't have the book with me at the moment, so  I hope I'm quoting her correctly:  &quot;Waste not my time, waste not your  own.  Ask only that which MUST be known.&quot;  My review's title comes  from the fact that this wonderful book was out of print for many years.   Back when I was in library school ['76-'77] and had no car, another student  from my dormitory was nice enough to give several of us a lift to a local  used bookstore.  There I spotted a copy of TATSINDA.  I bought it even  though the driver saw it and exclaimed that she loved that book.  I felt  horrible because she would have been able to buy it for herself if she  hadn't done me a kindness, but my better nature did not prevail.  I never  saw her again after graduation, so I couldn't even mail her another used  copy I found.  I'm so glad the book is in print again, not just for all the  readers who now have a chance to be as enchanted as I was, but because that  nice lady can get her own copy.	2000-07-07

I can force myself to stay awake even when I can barely keep my eyes open just to finish a good book.  Not this time.    This is also the first Buffy original novel where I didn't think  that the author captured the characters correctly.  I guess he didn't do  his research.  Certainly his Buffy seemed a bit of a wimp when compared to  the show and other novels.  His Willow and Giles were weaker than the norm,  too.     That said, the book does have its moments.  The Evil Plot was  reasonably evil.  I liked what happened with the cemetary and bathtub.  You  may go ahead and read the book, just don't expect much and you won't be  disappointed.	2000-07-05

You see, some employees have been so abused  in some previous situation that they aren't just afraid of change, they're  too traumatized to believe that a change could be for the better.  I'm  disappointed that a medical doctor didn't think to include some symptoms to  look for to help differentiate a formerly abused employee from a mere Hem.   It would have been even more helpful if he had included sound medical  advice on where to seek help for formerly abused employees.    As for the  story itself, if others find it helpful, good luck to them.  I found the  style annoyingly condescending, particularly from an  author whom I do not  consider to have thought things through before he wrote.	2000-07-03

Scarred was rescued from a very bad maze where he was given painful electric shocks no matter what he did.  Scarred was dropped down in Cheese Station C with no  treatment.  Scarred isn't just fearful, he's terrified and not sure if  anyone can be trusted.  I wish Dr. Johnson would include an afterword about  Scarred.  I'd like him to warn managers who are new to a company that the  cheese story won't help if the employees are like Scarred instead of like  Hem.  I'd like him to include some signs to look for to tell the  difference.  Some sound medical advice on how to help Scarred would be  helpful.    I've had a lot of supervisors in the last 20 years.  Some were  good, some were mediocre, a few were toxic, and a couple have been  wonderful.    Unfortunately, I recognized the first wonderful supervisor  only in restrospect because he came after a Mr. Toxic.  (One of my most  vivid memories of Mr. Toxic was the day he called me up to his desk and  pointed at his open briefcase sitting nearby.  He asked me if I saw the gun  in there.  He told me he wanted me to know he had it.)  I mention this  because Mr. Wonderful was trying to bring a good change into my career  almost 10 years before I achieved it.  I didn't help him because Mr. Toxic  had left me too frightened to trust and believe that this change would be  good for me.  I repeat:  managers, if you're following a Mr. or Ms. Toxic,  the cheese story is not enough.	2000-06-27

Until I took over the medical library at Fort Huachuca, AZ, I had no name for what happened to me.  For nearly 9 years I read my library's professional articles and books on child sexual abuse and former abuse.  I acknowledged, with intellectual interest, that many of the adult patients' symptoms applied to me.  What I learned didn't prompt me to seek treatment for the incest.  In fact, I ran away from therapy when my therapist wanted me to deal with the incest instead of just my depression.  Then, in 1990, our Community Mental Health Service ordered THE COURAGE TO HEAL.  While I was checking to make sure all of pages were there, I started reading the book.  Yes, CMHS unknowingly had to wait two or three more days to get their order because I *HAD* to get through this book.  Its first-person accounts affected me in a way those clinical reports never had.  [After reading the book] I knew I could no longer deny that the abuse was still affecting me.  When I got to work the next day, I asked for help.  I got it.  It wasn't easy.  The authors are correct to use the word &quot;courage.&quot; Working through the abuse was the hardest thing I ever did.  I think I shed 30 years' worth of tears in the second year of therapy.  I won't pretend I'm the person I would have been if I'd never been abused, but I am stronger and better than I would have been if I'd gone on pretending it was all in the past.  I've learned to fight for myself. If ever I forget how much I've changed, I have only to read my old diaries to know I'm not the whimpering mouse I was.  I'm so glad I read this book.  I'm also glad that I have such ready access to professional resources on child sexual abuse. That's how I know I don't have to fear that I was mislead by what THE COURAGE TO HEAL showed me.	2000-06-10
US	52640067	RSUX7A611N1B5	0441491421	683217473	Lord Darcy Investigates	Books	5	22	22	N	N	Lord Darcy does it again	Sadly, this is the last book that Randall Garrett wrote in the Lord Darcy series.  Like MURDER AND MAGIC, it is a collection of short stories that can be read separately.  Michael Kurland wrote two later Lord Darcy novels,  A STUDY IN SORCERY and TEN LITTLE WIZARDS, continuing the play on titles  from famous mystery authors' works that Mr. Garrett did with his own novel,  TOO MANY MAGICIANS.      Lord Darcy lives on an alternate Earth where a  13th century monk formulated the laws of magic so the laws of physical  science have never been discovered.  The scientists here are the sorcerers.   In fact, Lord Darcy's assistant is a Forensic Sorcerer.  They are in the  service of Richard, Duke of Normandy, younger brother of his Imperial  Majesty, King John IV of the Anglo-French Empire.  On this Earth the  Plantagenets still rule.  The book will explain, so I won't.  There is no  USA, by the way, just the duchies of New England.  The chief enemy of the  empire is the King of Poland, who has been unable to annex any more Russian  states and looks to take over King John's territory.  This brings in the  spy story element in a series that already combines the fantasy, science  fiction, and detective genres.  Also, Mr. Garrett does not neglect his  chance to poke gentle fun at our world.  Some of his characters are just as  skeptical of what we would consider scientific facts as our people are of  magic.  This allows the reader to feel smug when a character scoffs at  something we know is true.  Fans who love both mysteries and SF should not  neglect their opportunity to savor both combined.    The stories are:<br />     &quot;A Matter of Gravity&quot;:  A count stands in the way of his son  marrying the beautiful daughter of his captain.  The count goes through the  window of the topmost room of the Red Tower.  Did he jump, or was he  pushed?  A classic locked room puzzle.     &quot;The Ipswich Phial&quot;   The phial was stolen from the Ipswich Lab, where secret research in magic  is conducted.  The agent who pursued the thief is found murdered.  Now  Special Agent Sir James le Lien is asking Lord Darcy's help in recovering  the phial before Poland gets it.  (Yes, &quot;Sir James le Lien.&quot;  He  was in M&amp;M, just as TOO MANY MAGICIANS contained Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe  and Archie Goodwin tributes in the persons of Lord Darcy's equally  brilliant cousin, the fat and lazy Marquis de London and his Chief  Investigator, Lord Bontriomphe.  Wolfe fans should be sure to catch the de  London quotes in this and the following story.  BTW, I am indebted to my  friend, Charles Groak, for pointing out these tributes to me.) &quot;The  Sixteen Keys&quot;:  The late Lord Vauxhall has aged 50 years and died in  less than an hour.  Who did this terrible deed?  And where are the  important papers Vauxhall took with him? &quot;The Napoli Express&quot;:   That vital treaty MUST get to Athens on time.  Lord Darcy can't afford to  be delayed by a murder investigation.  He must solve the crime before the  train reaches Rome.	2000-05-30
US	52640067	R2ZRUZU0WQITTD	0553573004	308447755	Stud Rites	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Good Fight	Never mind the Kirkus review.  The dog facts weren't boring and I'm a cat lover who merely likes dogs.  I liked the analogies that the author used in order to help those of us who aren't dog fanatics to understand the  feelings of those who are.  I chuckled and cringed over Holly's reunion  with the man who had captured her heart when she was but a girl (and mother  was right).  Actually, I did a lot of chuckling and cringing during this  book.  It's a pity that no one thought to enter an unedited version of the  final judging video to one of those amateur video shows because it probably  would have won a prize. (Heaven knows that the donated lamp probably would  have made a worthy entry in the Ugliest Lamp contest.)  The bride's father  probably would have envied the lucky dad in book/film version(s) of  &quot;Father of the Bride.&quot;  I'm suprised the poor man didn't have a  heart attack before it was all over.  (Got a good chuckle out of Holly's  unspoken appraisal of the groom, not to mention her opinion of a woman who  would marry a man who's allergic to dogs.)  I would have been more upset  about the nasty way two fat characters were depicted if I hadn't already  known from the author's e-mail response to my complaint to her publisher  [over *Bloodlines* and *Black Ribbon*] that she was horrified when a friend  pointed that out to her, apologizes, and hopes that her three latest books  are not offensive. I stayed up until 11:30 to finish this book.  I could  have been in bed an hour earlier if I hadn't kept looking up at the TV to  see if Scully and Mulder were doing anything exciting for the  &quot;X-Files&quot; 2000 season finale.  That was a mistake.	2000-05-23
US	52640067	R2XHO7NI3A5VS0	0553107232	49203696	Tough Cookie	Books	4	3	7	N	N	Still tasty, but could use some different seasonings	I, too, wish that Goldie's life were not in perpetual crisis.  As a series progresses, it's nice to have the characters learn from experience.  I get very impatient with Goldie for making the same mistakes from book to book  even though, as a former victim of abuse [child, not spouse], I find her  attitude believable.  I was already middle-aged when I filed four EEO  complaints in 14 months [those complaints are all public record in  Arizona].  I kept making the same mistake in trusting the wrong persons,  being nice and hoping that would help, and being ridiculously shocked at  the next level of harassment escalation.  Luckily, it was the same years of  therapy that gave me the courage to fight back that enabled me to switch  tactics and end the harassment.  I recommend more therapy for Goldie, for  Arch, and definitely for this book's overly-suspicious pregnant widow (or I  fear for that baby's emotional health). That aside, I enjoyed the book.   The disasters on the cooking show, the art gallery scene, the descriptions  of people and places, that Marla is once again permitted to be stylish  though fat and that Goldie is permitted to find her fat husband sexy, and  the chilling chase scene at the climax. Speaking of Arch, it's rather a  pity that Marla doesn't give Goldie a complete set of &quot;Calvin &amp;  Hobbes&quot; books.  Reading them might enable Goldie to count her  blessings.    I'm not at all happy with the dust jacket, though.  Yes, it's  a cute visual pun on the title.  However, I grew up with the covers of  Nancy Drew, Judy Bolton; and science fiction and fantasy paperbacks.  I got  my parents to buy me my first Dana Girls book, *The Winking Ruby Mystery*,  just because I loved the cover.  I pulled the book out and looked at it  again not so long ago, and it had the same power to compel my gaze as it  did over 30 years ago.  When I think of what a marvelous opportunity for a  knockout cover this book's climax is, with Goldie's terrified run throughthat breathtaking scenery, a ruthless armed killer coming ever closer --  and we get a chef-shaped cookie jar with a gun.  If I were my cat, I'd  hiss!	2000-05-22

Loved the photos and the annotations.  I hadn't read the weaker stories before, so that was an added pleasure.  Actually, I liked those  lesser stories more than the editors' introductions would have led me to  believe.  Although it would have been nice to have seen more of Lovecraft's  best stories in this volume, I can understand the mix.  If all of his best  are annotated first, then readers will have only the lesser stories to look  forward to.  While I wouldn't wish to rush the editors, I eagerly await  another chance to have my Lovecraft experience enhanced.	2000-04-13

Until this book I had no idea that Max still wondered about how he compared to Sara's first husband.  I don't understand why Ms. MacLeod felt it necessary to demean Alexander.  It was particularly difficult to understand how Sara  could have been so unfair about Alexander because she had to work so hard  to overcome her strict upbringing in the earlier books.  Had she forgotten  that?  Shouldn't that have given her some sympathy, some insight into  Alexander's soul?       Alexander's mother was a domineering, EVIL woman.   She was undoubtedly crushing any sign of independence from the time he was  a child.  I can tell you from personal experience how difficult it is to  assert yourself if you were abused as a child.  It took years of therapy  for me to realize that I wasn't worthless and undeserving of happiness --  and my father was a fluffy kitten compared to Alexander's mother.    I  think Ms. MacLeod needs to bone up on adults who were abused as children.   Perhaps then she'll realize why I say that the end of THE BALLOON MAN was a  slap in our faces.     Otherwise, this was another good entry in a  delightful series.	2000-04-07

I'd heard that this series was really good, so when I spotted this book yesterday, I bought it.  While I was enjoying the book I was feeling smug because I thought I'd already guessed  three &quot;surprises&quot; that would be revealed in the end.  Well, the  Bible says that pride goes before disaster and a haughty spirit before a  fall.  While it wasn't a disaster, I *was* humbled.  Two of my guesses were  correct, but in each case I'd figured out the unimportant secret and  completely missed the more important ones about the characters.  My third  guess was only half correct.  I've had less trouble figuring out several  adult mysteries.  My hat is off to the author.  I'm going to end this  review so I may order the previous two books.	2000-01-04
