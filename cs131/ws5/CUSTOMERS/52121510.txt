The problem is nothing is very deep and there is a lot of information (handpiecing vs machine piecing) that is just not remarked upon.The book heavily concentrates on piecework and not quilting btw, which may be a shock to someone just picking this up and not viewing it thoroughly.  It does though go thru the various block types including circular and applique up to advanced issues.<br />Colour placement is also sketchy with a nod to the waterfall method of colour placement (dark outsides going to very light centres) but really very little on colour harmony and triadic usage. But the projects are very very nice but I don't think you use this book solely and make a good first quilt.	2004-05-15

There are some great ideas that span easy to medium hard, but the real kicker here is the abundance of variation patterns that are attached so if you don't like the picture they show but like the idea (x-stitched pillowcases, small tablecloths for example) you can change the motif to one of the many they offer.  Some are quite striking.  I think that this book is good for beginners and most of the patterns are easy or quickly made and some are for more advanced work &amp; require more effort or practice.	2004-05-09

Their other boook A-Z embroidery also covers most of the bullion knots in that very thorough tutorial so one has to wonder why get this one?  Well it's all about the animals, some really cute Aussie wombats, kangies and such, alphabets, samplers and bee hives.  You get this book to use those bullions and some of those other stitches in some really innovative ways.  The author actually makes the bullion do so much of the work that is usually done with satin stitch but with some extra oomph to the innovation side.<br />It's an enjoyable book and the projects give you enough to do that it's a real saver over those pre-packaged sets.	2003-09-28

The whole purpose of this book is to weigh a stop loss against a possible incorrectly placed volatile sale.<BR>If anyone trades with a regular basis they know the horror of being 'stopped out' because of volatile price swings.  Kaufman helps by correclty analyzing the benefits of stops vs losses showing how mechanized systems for stops have their own pitfalls.<br />Kaufman's whole treatise on RISK is really worth the price of the book.  Understanding risk and it's effect on your psychology is an important and very valuable treatise.  Kaufman does a very good job on the subject.  Also of benefit, is the Adaptive Moving Average algorithm.  While this is also part of Metastock<BR>having the formula is invaluable for those of us who want to modify it.  <br />The weakest part is the computerized system analysis at the end is old and rather simplistic; I would not recommend it.

The front is full of embroidery stitches detailed in execution.  The patterns follow.  The key to many of these books is whether the book has nice, usable patterns that are adaptable, thorough in instruction & reproducible.  I would say that this book fits all of these cases.  While everything is geared to embroidery, crossing over to needlepoint (evenweave) would not be difficult though the book doesn't encourage it because there is another book aimed for that audience.<br />Typical patterns are: birds, a koala:-) and flowers.  The use of colour is quite nice.  The only downside, is unlike the Cross Stitch Bible by Jane Greenoff, this book does not help you in designing your own patterns.  Still for the price you get allot of patterns and a good overall grounding in embroidery as it discusses the various wools and needles and transferring the patterns.<br />Good for beginners and those looking for some nice patterns with some atypical stitches.	2003-08-12

Ms Johnson-Srebro is a gifted technician but unfortunately some of the designs lose in the colour inspiration category & I think that detracts from her original and very inspired ideas.<BR>The premise of the book is simple.  Use rectangles and squares to make a block which can then be used for pillows, oven mitts, tree ornaments, wall hangings or part of a large quilt.  To this end Ms J-S gives different sizes for the finished quilt (6-15 inches are typical) so you don't have to worry about making the alterations.<BR>At the end are Quilt Maps where Ms J-S shows you how to use the blocks as part of a larger quilt.  Here, outside of the teacup and pot quilt the book is rather plebian and typical.  There really isn't much variation of using the different blocks into a full pictograph.  That's the pity but for a willing worker it could be done.<BR>Also, some of the blocks, like the cat and teapot, have blocks too large & ungainly.  They could easily broken up to get more colour shading and variation in though this too would be easy to modify because of her technique by simply using strips instead of a large block.<BR>All in all the execution does not live up to the idea but it could be a great springboard for further development.  A superb intro to piecework for all ages and allot of easy fun.	2003-08-10

The projects deal with some of the tricky ideas of half-stitch, beaded work, paper cross stitch and of course interspersing cross-stitch with regular embroidery.

They cover everything from quilts, wall hangings to table runners, stockings and Christmas tree rounds.  You can mix and match the ideas here and make everything you need for Christmas.<BR>The nice parts are that the directions are complete for both hand piecing and machine (called fusible in the book) sewing &amp; that most of the designs require small amounts (1/2 yard; 5/8 yard there) of fabric so if you have leftovers you can find places to use them here.  Also nice is the ability to copy the designs for your own use.  A nice present in itself.<BR>The downside?  You should be near a copier and have sharp scissors.<BR>All in all, a great way to get into the Christmas spirit.  It's a real joy to view and look at.  I wish some of the designs were shown bigger in colour but it's a minor quibble.	2003-08-06

Great ideas here.  What is particularly special about this one though is that it is very good in giving you projects on building your skills.  These sections could be invaluable (they helped me with my regular sewing) and should not be skipped.  (The Amish book does not have the same skill builder section. )<br />So this book is a mixed bag and had the designs been prettier I would have scored it higher particularly because of the skills section, but I consider the beauty aspect rather important.

She then goes into the quilts breaking them up into geographic location and laying out the colour, piecework patterns and then quilting motifs for you to make an authentic Amish legacy wall-hanging quillt.<br />I have another one of Pellman's books and the big difference here is one of course the size, most are 47x47 inches and two the use of colour.  Most of Pellman's books are black and white but this one is in full colour which is rather funny because once you see these quilts in colour you realise why the cheaper black and white can be used.  But still seeing the colour spectrum as the Amish use it is very helpful and cannot be discounted.  It's a good reference there just on the colour motifs and how to build or identify an Authentic Amish quilt (Center diamond should be in what colours and what quilting style for example).<br />Because everything is in the authentic mode, Pellman does not mention anything about machine piecing or quilting, but then you should have Hargreave's book, the definitive source, so you'll never have to care.  The instructions are fine, I used them to make 2 quilts, but in the end it's rather plain being Amish all the time (remember no patterns :-).<br />Still it seems to be comprehensive and answer all of your questions except that I think it should have had some of the quilts as samples so we could see how the various pieces do fit together and look.  It's a workmanlike book, not very inspired.	2003-05-18

If this is your thing, as it is mine, you will be very sorry here.  2 silk stitches and that's all.  But if you do crewel and needlepoint there is literally nothing as good as this.  Very clear explanations and good shots of the stitches themselves with alpha lettering to guide you...Everything is in full colour and that helps.  While the word Sampler is used, there are no projects in this book as it really is a dictionary like Mary Thomas's Dictionary of Embroidery of Stitches.  The difference between the two books is Mary's version shows the stitches as both embroidery and needlework while Lucinda tells you that they can be worked either way but does not show them.  I guess in the end that's why there is no silk :-)	2003-05-03

Anna's tassel's are completely inspiring and I saw this book first but saw right away I could not do it so I got the The Art of Tassel Making by Susan Dickens to teach me the basics.<br />This book was my inspiration &amp; I have to admit it's just gorgeous.  But you need to learn the basics elsewhere and then keep in mind many of Anna's design precepts and then you will be able to make beautiful almost artistic tassels, like I can now.<br />The greatest disappointment in this book is no AMERICAN references; US references exist but Anna prefers to give those that are part of the Commonwealth (UK, Canada, Oz, NZ).  She also gives the designs for the wood which if you or someone is handy can make themselves by wood-turning.  Again if you are not then<br />you'll have to order from her over in the UK or look via the Net<br />for a supplier in US.<br />And of course like all crafts, what do you do with all these tassels?  That's the real sorrow.  Hint, I give many away.	2003-05-02

It's all line drawings, some photos, boringly presented and basically an adhoc production.  Boring and uninspiring.  It's written because Montano in her Crazy Quilt Book (superb!) tells how embroidery is the make or break deal in a crazy quilt but this book does not live up to those expectations.<br />Instead try Lucinda Ganderton's a Stitch Sampler, where colour threads are used and everything is easily viewed or if a Montano is what you are seeking go for the gold and get her Crazy Quilting book, where the main stitches are detailed and her methods outlined.

A superb coffee table book BUT not a how-to let me show you how one. If you want to make these projects you'll have to buy them from her OR get the Ann Cox Beginner's Guide and learn how.  Ms. Eriksson's directions are rather sketchy and terse.  An unfortunate after-effect of thiis terseness is that the book feels more like a catalogue, hence the coffee book category, than a craft manual.<br />Most of the projects are superb but towards the end they fall into the Helen Gibb (another Oz ribbon worker) category and become overly-done garish Victoriana. That aside there is some seriously good embroidery here and if get the Ann Cox book you can figure out how to make that all happen.

Well I think is an important part of the story and withtout that tidbit it looks like was just trying to find a shortcut for his spreadsheet & do something unique.<br />The ideas he has are valuable but throughout the book one wonders why Bolly Bands & not StdError or Projection Bands?  Why Bolly Bands and not Channels with their implied daily range of volatility?  Putting Bolly Bands with indicators is helpful in explaining this though I think it woulb be more valuable to see some of the applications.<br />In the end though, I felt that Bollinger was trying to sell me his website ...& not really give me all the information I needed to make my own decision.  Bollinger did make a good case that some type of bands might be valuable but he did not make a strong case that it should be Bolly ones.  The book is of limited use though it could expand your horizons on the whole Bands/Channel topic.	2003-03-09

Connie is a superb teach and educator.  There are so many nuggets of gold in this book I don't know where to start (great help, eh?) but first her work on indicators is out of this world.  Yes she acknowledges Cardwell, the man of the RSI wizardy, and goes on to say how she differs from him (in the area of divergences).  She tells you how understanding indicators cost her 9 years and after saying that admits she will not give you the secret for a lousy $40.00.  Fair enough.  She gives allot of hints and if you work hard (very hard) slowly it will dawn on you what she is saying.<br />I have new respect for indicators & Elliott waves & while I admit I have yet to master both I feel confident that I have a guide that will point me in the right direction.If you are a serious trader, fulltime in this bear market, you should definitely read this work.

It tells us that  the Islamic al-qaeda front is the Borg and the West is powerless to stop it so we shouldn't but instead allow it to run amok or with their very Clinton-esque methods co-exist with it.  Forget Reagan and SDI, it never happened not because the Left would not spend money on defense & Star Wars but because it's never mentioned.  Easy way to debate your opponents; don't mention them.  Clinton was the first and only to see this threat; he knew.  Didn't tell us but that was because he was truly presidential, not like these little people today or those old war-mongers who just saw Cold War.<br />There is little fact here, lots of polemic.  Lots of polemic.  I expected more facts on the hows but I got more on the why's the Muslims hate the West and how their 'mindfulness' is something we can never understand or beat.  <br />And yes the poor grammar, 'more important' drags on.

The first is the sample is cherry picked based on fundamentals which TB never gives out.  The second is that while TB is obviously familiar with stats (he mentions the terms freq distribution &amp; population enough that at least a passing idea of them is true) he dwells on the sample of 500 stocks over 5 years and gives us a population of X.  Well that's a bit bogus as most PATTERNS take longer than a day to create (forget this hanging man thing, it's minor) so if you average out the span of a pattern creation, which is the true size of a sample not the one day of data, that he is using.  Finally this books data was from only one market, a baby bull market, whether the stats quoted would hold up in a bear or a mature bull is questionable.  I for sure wouldn't be able to extrapolate that based on what's given.<br />I'd recommend the source instead, Edwards &amp; Magee, Technical Analysis of Stock Trends &amp; for those interested in indicators/gann/elliott waves, Connie Browns Aerodynamic Trading.<br />On the plus side, it is very complete though the kook-sounding review about trendlines and support has a point; a lot of TB's work could have been done with Fib Retracement levels.  Still if you are really into patterns you cannot pass it by though realize it's a starter in your analysis not a complete foundation.  The 'Sample Trade' section is a real waste; there is not enough information other than pattern formation for you to do your own analysis.  If you read the Identifcation section and the first summary paragraph you probably have gotten all you need out of the 46 chapters and saved yourself a lot of time.	2003-01-29

There is an intro the machine and hand sewing and then the all important hemming lessons.  From there you start with t-shirts!  Yes we're off and running already with garments.  I was not prepared for this thinking I would be doing pillows and potholders and other nonsense, but no let's get practical.  Garments like t-shirts, wrap skirts, pull on pants/shorts head the list.  They tell you how to read the pattern and then guide you thru making the actual garment giving you hints and tips to making an easy &amp; wearable piece.<br />After garments we go home dec and do the pillows, curtains and shades.  There are enough projects in here to keep you busy for about 6 months at which point you should know the basics &amp; know where to go from there on your own.  Daunting, eh? Well I was impressed and got going immediately.  I got really psyched and I think a project a fortnight is doable.  They recommend making more than 1 garment of each type to solidify what you know so unless you're very industrious a project a week is a rough haul.  This book is easy, approachable and most importantly, inspiring, so much so instead of using my old high school one I actually bought a brand new beginning machine (A Viking Huskystar 207).  <br />If you've been thinking about sewing buy this book and take the plunge.  Until I got this book I never realised how much was based on the simple t-shirt (pj's, sweats, turtlenecks).  Enjoy.	2003-01-28

That should set the tone for you right off the bat.<br />The book's strength is that is a very basic book, what is a chart? Why weeklies? What is a trendline? How do you draw one, etc...This should not be ignored and since most people do this basic skill incorrectly one cannot ignored solid advice and Murphy does a great job on that. He also cover the major chart patterns & indicators but he does not explain the underlying psychology of the chart pattern, you would need the dry tomes of Magee & Edwards or the very complete analysis & more readable Bulkowski for that; John does not feel that part of it is necessary. He is a real 'purist'.<br />There is information on sectors and his pivotal intermarket analysis with a nod to sector rotation and what is a sector. All of these things make this a solid \\"dummies\\" guide, or a solid reference if you don't already own one.<br />The downside to this solid reference is Indicator Failure or Divergences. Murphy really does not hammer this one down & that is just as necessary as why channels (Andrews pitchforks, Raff Regressions etc) are good to know.  He also does not show how channels, pitchforks et alia can show you how to visually see a pattern.  But then it's a basic guide, no real flesh added on.<BR>Just how to use the basic set of indicators, not go beyond them & read the nuances.<br />But still you cannot go wrong with this solid performer if you are beginning; it just won't do much more.	2002-12-04

A year ago during a mild winter, two weeks before christmas, the NE got a cold snap.  IN the spirit of Yuletide I decided we should have a hot toddy.  I searched  my many cookbooks &amp; found nothing.  Went to the web and finally found a recipe (this took about 20 minuets via askjeeves) &amp; we were finally able to happily quaff our drinks that cold winter's night.  So I bought O'Hara's book in that spirit; hoping for more information and  recipes that would be of Yuletides past.  O'Hara delivered for I surely got that.  <BR>O'Hara also tosses in how to stock a bar, make lemonade, grenadine &amp; cranberry juice, the history of most drinks (champagne and wines) &amp; where you have to pay for the premium line and when you could avoid it.<br />On the downside, I did not like that the recipes as a rule were for parties; rarely does O&quot;hara scale down for just a few people but luckily since all the measurements are 1 1/4 quarts of milk for 12 or 12 eggs for 12-14 a calculator could easily manage it for you.  Unfortunately he does not tell you how many ounces are in a quart but if you don't know, other cookbooks should be able to manage that for you (hint hint Fannie Farmer, Joy of Cooking).<BR>Also he gives the classic recipe for eggnog with raw eggs but neglects that if you use his recipe on Tom &amp; Jerry you could easily produce a cooked (and thus safe) version.  Despite these quibbles O'Hara is very thorough on holiday drinks &amp; tells you what you need and don't.  The fotos keep the book's spirit and add allot of colour.<br />For those who don't imbibe, O'Hara does tell you how to make  non-alcoholic versions , just use more milk, &amp; most of the ingredients are in your house.  Instructions are a breeze. <BR>It's been a colder autumn than normal in the NE and I'm glad I've got O'Hara to help keep me warm and my spirits high ;-) <BR>Wassail!	2002-11-03

Well White does a superb job explaining the differences in the beginning & giving some history to how they arose. A chowder doesn't mean seafood & White gives many that are not seafood based.  Chowder though does mean milk & cream & tho White admits you can change the chowder to non-milk based it's now a stew & loses some of its bite.  Instead use Lact-aid (lactose free) milk & for cream make a (blache roux) white sauce for substitution & you will be richly rewarded.  <br />The chowders are superb. Tasty. But getting the seafood ingredients (quahogs) might be tricky though White does give substitutes for those not in either the North Atlantic or  Pac West. There are non-seafood chowders though (about 20) for those who can't do seafood for whatever reason.<br />But all in all these were chowders from my childhood in New England eaten during great Nor-Easters and winter Saturdays with baked beans (see Fannie Farmer for a really authentic recipe). White gives really good chowder though...and yes it brings back those Aunt Freda memories :-)  Cook's Illustrated refers to White in their chowder recipe found in American Classics if you only want an idea of chowders and would prefer a fuller book.	2002-10-10

This is a soup book based on a successful restaurant, thus it is their recipes that they sold.  Having said that it is quite good.  No pictures, lots of ingredients, many steps.  If you are a beginner this could take a while to assemble a soup.  Quantities are exact.  Ingredients are exact:  Yukon gold potatoes, blue pots & white boilers.  If you cannot get these ingredients you will not have the same success BUT, again the caveats, some are simpler with more easily obtainable ingredients.  Well done.  Tasty.  Delicious chili.  Good soup.<br />And yes you have to love soup.	2002-10-10

Thompson breaks down every ingredient and discusses it thoroughly. Beautifully done with great pictures. You'll learn allot about Thailand from this book.<br />The downside? Well there are allot of steps and that's not Thompson's fault but part of the Thai culinary scene. The ingredients on the other hand could be cheeky for people out of a cosmopolitan city like NYC to obtain: lemon grass, fish sauce, galonga. But the worst was no recipe for fish sauce, which I did find in Mai Pham's book on Vietnamese cooking (its anchovy based:-). Unfortunately most commerical fish sauces are msg prepared and being allergic to it I was hoping for a way to make this myself (fish sauce is a staple of most SE Asian food, Thai included, btw). Alas though not forthcoming Thompson does tell us that the commercially prepared varieties are quite good. <br />Still, despite this,  I did not downgrade the book on that account because I think that this is best book on Thai food I've ever seen & I own The Beautiful Thai Cookbook & What's Thai.  I would recommend neither after reading/using Thompson's book.	2002-10-04

This is rather common throughout Northern California so I guess that's why the reviewers from Wash and etc think this is terrific.  It's pretty normal here.  The food of course it exquisitely prepared and done; that's to be expected.  Most restaurants throughout NoCal are on the same level some better for the total experience than others.<br />The book though is rather culty and elitist and really rather shallow.  It's probably a great seller to its fans though Puck's books are better on that scale.  The photos are poor, really haute novelle cuisine:  one raviloi, one this or that and unfortunately not great quality.  Lots of them though so look thru the pix and see if you would want to eat this first.  Preparation of course is a nightmare and the book doesn't really help you much on that score; you iether can cook like that or can't.

It's sad because it means that no more books will be penned by this solid investigative reporter & I think that is something as a nation we need.<br />And yet the Clinton \\"mandarin\\" dynasty is not unique to the USA and if you wonder how those under dictatorships elsewhere keep their mouth closed and just muddle on, read Olson's book and learn about the Clinton era where everyone ignored his abuse of power because there was a 'feel-good' bubble economy going on.  It's no different in those other dictatorships; it's a relative answer.<br />All in all this is a greatly disturbing dark tale; one that gives no hope to the USA marching on the road to serfdom, because of the incredible amount that the Clintons stole & got away.  In fact it portends something far worse the 'informed' populace looks no brighter now then it was then, still listening to the Media and their self-interest & still being denuded of their rights for a miniscule 'spoil' of the riches.<BR>An incredible story; how can this be true?

Nison is for those who use indicators; Morris is the purist using only volume.<br />Reference book?  Morris gives you the picture and the explanation in an easy format and an index to find it.  He also breaks the candles into groups and types.  This is the valuable part of the book.<br />Who is more in depth?  Well that's a tie with Morris winning slightly on candles &amp; losing if you want to view the whole Japanese charting world, Kagi, Renko, 3 line break.  Nison gives other Japanese charting types weight in the book which is good if you have Metastock bad if you don't.  Personally I like the other methods.<br />So why did I give Morris the nod?  As a professional trader I can't really give away an edge except that Morris is more tuned towards stocks &amp; gives hints that Nison did not.<br />Nison is also a boring writer, better lecturer.  Morris is a better writer, teacher.<br />Remember Morris gives you everything and if that's not enough then you're not reading carefully; looking over these previous reviews makes me happy because they obviously missed Morris' hints and guides.  I saw them and my trading improved &amp; I had used Candles for a long time before getting to Morris ala Nison &amp; began to think them worthless.

It really goes into how Wilson the man/president was made and what his prejudices, virtues and hotpoints were very well.<br />The beginning of the book is rather boring but once Wilson becomes president it definitely gets more interesting & how Wilson handled the aftermath of WWI very inciteful & apropos for us going into war against Afghanistan now with the modern day League of Nations, the UN, trying to arbitrate their own world order.<br />I think Louis Auchinchloss, cousin of the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did a good job on the research & unless you are a Wilsonophile this should be more than enough.	2002-07-26

This book was absolutely outstanding and worth not only buying but keeping.  I did not like volume #1 at all; there was really nothing in that &amp; I doubted whether the traders interviewed had anything of value to give the reader.  This book though is of a much higher quality as it delves more into Trading Systems &amp; their psychology than previously.<br />A key thing you will learn from these interviews is best exemplified by Mike Carr a Turtle:  Don't care what the market will do, Care what you will do when the market does it.<br />The gem in this series is Warren Eckhardt.  In the first book the Ritchie Dennis &amp; Will O'Neil interviews were the real gems.  The others in vol#1 were totally without value including the GREAT Ed Seykota who is just a wise-acre with flippant answers and a juvenile sense of humour.  Here in volume 2 even minor traders have more to say, perhaps Jack got better in getting information out of them?<br />Anyhow, remember more than HALF of these people have since gone the way of Livermore and blown up and those that haven't are RETIRED and teach at high costs.	2002-07-20

That aside, Vickie writes in a rambling stream of consciousness style that reels you in.  He is a good writer though the book is not that well edited.<BR>All that aside, Vickie gives tons of facts and stats showing you different aspects of trading & the importance of a trading system based in science not ART (i.e. feel).  <br />Vic makes one think allot about one's methods, whether it be trend or discretionary following, technical or fundamental analysis.  Vickie is like Larry William's a 'contextual analyst' & that's the good part.  The bad part & why Vickie really died in the Asian crisis was his non-belief in risk management.  In fact unfortunately Vic is a contrarian from the get-go for no other reason than he is too smart, too quick, too good and believes he is immortal.  <br />Vic now writes for Moneycentral and (another website) & he often sling barbs; you can learn allot from the interchange.<BR>But in the end, I know Vic doesn't want to hear this, but it is really is an update of Livermore's Reminiscences of a Stock Operator (and Vic' grandfather knew the boy wonder :-).  In both cases, MONEY management would have averted the fall.  But Vic doesn't 'believe' in it.  A shame.<br />The Education is an important book from which to learn the humility of man and the importance of God.  Vic instead takes faith in the synchronicity of Nature as though it can save him.  One can only hope that Vic ultimately learns that his contrary atheism did him in so that he can  take his place among the greats...in the mean time read it & learn.  No one is too great fall & many in this bear market did including more than half of those profiled in Schwager's books.<br />Take care, it's a jungle out there.

If you fit in, then it's a must buy.  If you are not sure if the GSD is for you, buy this book as you will learn what is so special about the breed.<br />If you are not thinking of getting a GSD or one of thw working breeds, ACDs, AS, Collies etc. then pass it by.  It really does not work with the Sporting or Toys breeds- wnich is only failing but then no book is perfect for everyone.	2001-06-17

Unfortunately the Ternan connection does not work well, and only shows that while everything had an effect on CD. no one can claim to be The effect. As for Nelly, she is a nice woman who history passed by.  While she may not have had the effect on Dickens that Tomalin hoped for, her story is interesting because she was an actress and her story shows how Victoriana treated them and more importantly how entertainers lived on the edge of society then (and now in the midst of it as now).  It is also of somewhat sad that nothing of her letters to CD and his to hers reamin, and a sad note that whatever she learned of CD is lost to time. BTW, Kate Redding does another good job reading.  It's a slow book but feminists may be interested; traditionalists would not.	2001-06-17

I think he just didn't know how to edit himself and was looking to make 'big volumes'. I have read all of the series and his earlier works up to the Renaissance, were much much better. This book is boring and I cannot understand how 4 volumes came out of the Enlightment, except this unrepetant liberal really loved Rationalism and the Napoleonic code.  Unless you too are very liberal and want to view history that way pass this by. Out of the French books, Voltaire and Napoleon are the best but again no where near the intensity and interest of earlier ones.	2001-05-10

I do not think that GOlden really understands why Austen/Kaye are such important writers nor their characters development within the book.  Instead his attempt is lacking in so many respects that I found the book disappointing.<br />BUT it's an accurate portrayal of Shintoist philosophy and the life of a geisha.  It on this level that I found the book compelling; unfortunately our Memoirist is a poorly drawn character who never manages to be more than a caricuture.<br />The book itself is better in the first part (prior to WWII) than the second.  The last few (2) chapters should have been chopped.	2001-04-14
US	52121510	R3H65PM50DRDTI	0345311485	12581581	On the Beach	Books	5	1	4	N	N	A superb story, well told and riveting	I've read the other reviews.  First It is scientifically accurate based on verifitcation from my physicist husband.  Second cutting a 120 pages, would leave you with what?  Third boring?  I read the story in two days, gave up a weekend, and I don't do that anymore. Now, if you read this YOU MUST read Larry Niven's Rainbow Mars collection, particularly the last story, Death in A Cage, which covers this book also.  I came upon it surrendipitiously but now I recommend it highly as a great one two punch. Now to On the Beach.  I did not know what the storyline was, except my husband recommended it and referred to it often.  I was stunned and shocked to find out in Chapter 1 that there had been a Nuclear War started by small powers -- not China, Russia, USA but little one's like Albania in the story or Iraq, now...  The spoiled child who if he can't win no one does... I find this plausible.  It is well told and romantic -- very romantic and yet...If the bombs get dropped, Shute is right, it goes this way....	2001-04-01

This guy, Lester, is a fool.  His quibbles make it sound like you get no value from this book.  Well let me hit his reasons and explain to you why THIS book rocks.   Chatty..Dunno but Dickie never spoke much to me.  Perhaps you have to be attuned to that; Errors...yeah there are some.  He noted ALL of them so if Dickie puts up an errata you're good OR use Lester's errata, same thing.  The ReverseString (Mandy) I think is getting neurotic.  What book doesn't throw in perverse things BECAUSE you may be interested or may think of a reason (e.g. password generation); what book doesn't have errors?  What software doesn't have errors? My quibble?  More time on assignments and initialization (like a few extra notes). But beyond that, the book is great.  I think one weekend is extreme, but if you are motivated I think it could be done.  I am not that motivated and instead I think 1 section a day (Friday morning is a day, Saturday is 3 days; Sunday 1 or 2 days depending upon interest) is great and in 1 week you're up and running.   Great concept flawed execution but this is a Microsoft book, eh? In the meantime, Dickie you really ought to put up an errata and think about assignments -- it would have made me life easier.

The NT side of the book is solid and if you are learning Oracle on a NT box this is a great help; on the other hand, there are Oracle errors BUT no worries, if you check the Tables you will easily find them even IF you have no Oracle experience. I like the 24 hour series and this book is no exception, I just it had been better checked; but on the other hand, at this price, a few flaws seem petty to point out.	2000-11-14

This book explains why to get a dog of European bloodlines vs American and how to read the mysterious SV papers from the USA (United Schutzhund Assoc).  The section on picking a pup is helpful though again not very indepth but better than nothing; there should have been more about the differences of puppies anod how your puppy  greets you initially and how to interpret the puppy appitude test.  Also I think a breakdown of the colour in GSDs would be helpful.<br />The health section was actually what I thought was the weakest part of the book:  no mention of the dreaded epilepsy, other than in the first aid section,  and having lost a GSD to idiopathic epilepsy I am sensitive to that issue (she does give a one liner to it showing up in certain lines).  Also did not really mention the diet to CHD relationship either, putting ALOT of weight on genetics and that is a polygenetic disease where overfeeding and type of food matters.<br />A great history of von Stephanitz and his goals of the breed in an easy freindly style.  This is helpful to see why the Europeans breed one way and the Americans another. <br />Overall a good intro but don't let this be your only puppy book even if it's your own GSD book.  I'd recommend The Perfect Puppy by Gwen Bailey for overall puppy training as a supplement.	2000-10-01

When I started using this book I was dabbling between 4 and 3 alot.  4 is akin to a mouth of toothaches that are throbbing; 3 is a constant dull numbness  that takes away concentration but allows menial labour and tasks to be  performed; 2 is spasmodic pain or pain with certain movements; 1 is know  it's there at all and doesn't bother me , hey I can function!  It gives  practical ideas and hints and help on what to do and makes you realize that  sometimes rest is just necessary. Between this and Dr Michael Murray's  Arthritis book you'll be back on track before long.  Please try this book,  it is superb and truly worth your money and time.  If you have arthritis  and are really willing to work with it this book will get you there. (BTW I  am now mainly level 1!  It's a great to be alive!)	2000-08-01

It is a handbook.  A book to refer to.  A book to use on site at work.  In that light it is excellent and the only reason it received 4 stars was I could  not download the queries nor did they come with the  book on a diskette or some electronic media.  I found this to be an  unfortunate flaw in an otherwise good cookbook to have on hand.	2000-06-01

I have arthirtis of the spine (ankylosing sponditis) and been told by  doctors that there is no cure just PT.  Dr Murray gives you an explanation  of what went wrong, (while my disease is genetic why doesn't everyone with  the gene get it?), nutritional vitamins and finally a diet to help and  somewhat reverse the tide. Has it helped?  In the two weeks I bought this  book it has; my pain is less, much less, and while I am not totally  faithful I am beginning to become a devout convert.   If you have arthrits,  ulcerative colitis (ra and uc are genetically related) or uncontrolled  allergies, this man knows how to handle them.  I've searched everywhere and  he has the answer.
