When I first saw the cover of this book I was really happy because a reader could tell that it was really an interracial romance. The reader didn't have to guess what the heroine \\"was\\" like some other novels out here lately, but I was very disappointed with the book a whole. <br /> <br />Lacie's former boss left and her new boss came in, but she didn't know he was her boss when the first ran into each other in the elevator. She just thought of him as attractive in a passing thought, because she didn't date white men. In addition Lacie's was running late on the first day she was going to meet her new boss. <br /> <br />She didn't find out until later on that morning the attractive, friendly, white stranger from the elevator was her new boss and she would be working closely with him. <br /> <br />Anothny \\"Tony\\" Douglas found Lacie's very alluring the first moment he saw her on the elevator and was very happy he would get the chance to work with her, however he soon found out that although Lacie was attracted to him, she didn't want to explore the possible of them being a couple. <br /> <br />Instead she started dating his best friend and their new client at the firm Joe, that she had previously meet at a nightclub while trying to figure out a way to dump her current boyfriend at the time. Lacie finally dumped her old boyfriend Steven, because he wasn't giving her what she wanted.  Yet, she still wasn't about to get Tony any encouragement. <br /> <br />Lacie's whinning, boring family was another problem, I found with the book. The teenage little sister who gets pregnant by her boyfriend and the nosy, bossy mother who doesn't want her Lacie to date \\"Mister Charlie\\" is just too much. She thinks know how to keep control of everything going on around in in the book, but she really doesn't. <br /> <br />Finally, after dating Joe for a while, he asks Lacie's to marry him and she agrees, but is really in love with Tony and doesn't know how to break things off with Joe. However, in the end she dumps Joe, fights with Tony some more about her feelings, but in the end Laci tell him how she feels. <br /> <br />I never thought Laci gave Tony enough consideration in this book at all. He was always honest with her about him feelings from the beginning, but she kept him on the roller coaster ride of emotions until she was ready to give him what he wanted. <br /> <br />I didn't hate the book, because some points of it was good. Like Tony never gave up on Lacie no matter how many times, she pushed him away. <br /> <br />But I thought Lacie needed to spend more time with Tony and less with her crazy family, friends and neighbor. It took Lacie was too long to come to the terms with her love for Tony. <br /> <br />There wasn't much romance or love on Lacie's part toward Tony, but Tony was very enjoyable on my part.	2005-05-12

I don't know what to exactly say abou this particular book. Picking up the Pieces left me wanting more. Althea Almott was a model that got divorced from her rich husband and came back home to run straight into her ex-lover Harry Benson at the airport. <br /> <br />Harry Bensen had never stopped loving Althea and wanted to find a way to get her back into his life when he finds out about her divorce. <br /> <br />But what confused me about the book is I never knew why they exactly broke up. Was it a racial issue from her side or his side. Did Althea want her career more than him? How did they become lovers in the first place? <br /> <br />I could never really grasp the characters inside the story at all. They kept me wanting more, but I never get it.  The concept of how the two got back together confused me too. Harry gets sick in the airport and Althea can't stand the sight of him and doesn't want him around her, but she tells the hospital she'll nurse him back to health? Why would she do that? <br /> <br />Harry loves her, but doesn't want to stay and fight for her after overhearing a small portion of a private converstion with her ex-husband. Instead he storms out and make Althea track him down and explain her feeling more?  <br /> <br />I really never felt the love between the characters in the book and I wished I had. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm not use to reading Silhouette Romance books and that the reason the characters and plot didn't grab me, but I did't fall in love with the hero and heroine in this book.  <br />	2005-04-02

At first I was really worried about purchasing this book, because I could never find any reviews about this book. However, as a lover of Interrracial romances WM/BW I went ahead and spent the money for it, and boy was I happy that I did.    Katrina Lawson,a very independent intelligent, and headstrong woman loved the horse ranch that her parents owned. Having a black mother and a white father made her very self-confident and she didn't take orders from anyone at all. She loved working with horses, but on in particular was her favorite. Ares, a beautiful black stallion that she loved riding.    While she was out camping one night with Ares, a thick fog surrounded her out of nowhere. Standing up she looked into a saw a knight leading his soliders toward her. Trying to protect herself and Ares, she stood in front of them ready to fight.    Marcus Quinn saw the amazaing horses through the fog and knew might have it. Leading his men through the he prepared the capture the animal when the woman stopped him. Taking her captive her took her back to his castle trying to deny the instant attraction he felt for her.    Never in his life has he wanted a woman as much as her. Katrina was strong, and took care of herself. No matter how he tried to boss or around, she wouldn't have any of it. If he didn't or couldnt' treat her as an equal she told him to leave her alone.    Katrina tried her bests to fight the bone sizzling attraction she had for the black haired, green eyes knight that took her back to his castle, but it became too much to handle and they finally both came into their feelings falling in love in the process.    Marcus and Katrina have to deal with people trying to break them up from Marcus'crazy mistress and overprotective mother, to another knight that's jealous of his wealth and power.    They both know there will come a time that Katrina has to leave, but neither wanted to accept it.     Eventually the time does comes and Katrina goes back to her time leaving Marcus to deal with his, but he made her A knight's Vow to find her again and he does.    A Knight's vow is a witty, page-turning book that you can finish in one day(It took me two days,but I love it from the first page to the last page). The writer was very creative and I loved that the hero was a strong black woman, yet she didn't take away from Marcus still being the alpha male. They both played off each other wonderfully.    This is one of the best IR books, I've read this year because of the unique way the writer told the story. Aliyah Burke made you feel like you were there will Marcus and Katrina when they went through all their problems. If I could give it more than five stars I would.    Excellent read in my opinion. I enjoyed the book and I hope other future readers will too.	2005-03-03

I thought it could have been much better. However, I did enjoy the IR romance betweewn African American antique collector Rita Young and white Pastor Michael Green. <br /> <br />The two first meet when Rita was having a panic attack outside her father's church and Pastor Green drove up. Her father had died and Pastor green was there as his replacement. <br /> <br />They were attracted to each other from the beginning, but didn't know how to act on it. Slowly, they allowed themselves to develop and build a relationship even though Michael's news reporter sister hated the ideal. In addition, Rita overprotective and bossy mother was totally agaisnt it and did everything in her power to break them up. <br /> <br />In his eyes was a sweet, caring story. Pastor Green did have a hard time dealing with his feelings for Rita, because he didn't want to become between her family and the church. He was a white pastor at an all black church. He didn't want the rumors to destroy Rita. So, several times during the book he tired to break them off which hurt Rita more than the rumors. <br /> <br />Rita fought to keep the peace between her mother, the church, and the new wonderful emotions she was feeling for Michael. She didn't care about the color of his skin. The only thing that matter was he loved her and wanted to be with her. <br /> <br />Now, there isn't ANY sex or romantic touching in this book. But don't let that keep you from buying it. The format of the book did throw me off a little, but I believe it's a self-published book, so that could be the reasons for the typos and other mistakes I found inside. Yet, I found that I really enjoyed the sweet romance between the two main characters. I loved how Michael was human and not the alpha male, He had flaws. <br /> <br />In his eyes may not appeal to all readers out there, so if you can check it out at the library do it. However, if you an IR book collectorand want to add another book to your bookshelf, get this book. However, I will say again it may not appeal to all IR readers, especially readers who enjoy HOT, STEAMY sex in their books.	2005-02-22

The five-foot-eight beauty with large, deep set, dark brown eyes has always been able to keep her distance from any man while undercover, until she meets Gabriel Cole.<br />Gabriel Cole, a multi-award-winning musician, who is also working at the high school in the music department is mesmerized by Summer's stunning beauty and intelligence.

She makes him feel the intensity of loving one person completely, and the desire to create and raise a family with her. He wants to make Summer his wife, but Summer is holding something back. Will Summer tell Gabriel about the double life she's leading? Or will her dangerous masquerade ruin both of their lives?<br />RENEGADE, the last in the Hideaway series by Rochelle Alers, and completes the legacy with style by including the characters from the previous Hideaway stories: HIDEAWAY, HIDDEN AGENDA, VOWS, HEAVEN SENT, HARVEST MOON, JUST BEFORE DAWN, PRIVATE PASSIONS,  NO COMPROMISE, HOMECOMING. The tightly-knit Cole family stands up for one another, and Ms.Alers incorporates Summer and Gabriel into the long time trilogy with passion. The Cole females are treated with love and respect by the Cole males and RENEGADE keeps the love and warmth going with Summer's and Gabriel's love story. Summer and Gabriel will do anything for each other. Rochelle Alers writes about both characters with insight and emotion. Summer's and Gabriel's love is riveting and compelling. When Summer realizes she has fallen in love with Gabriel, she stills holds back, not wanting to tell him about her DEA life until her assignment is over.<br />I consider Gabriel a combination of an alpha hero and a beta hero . He feels he needs to protect Summer, but he's also treats Summer with love and patience. He doesn't rush her into the relationship. He allows her to move at her own pace. Gabriel is there to comfort Summer after she confides to him about her brother died from a driving by shooting. Respecting Summer is a huge part of Gabriel's personality and makes him the fantasy man every woman wants, but few are able to find in reality.<br />Summer is the challegne Gabriel needs in his life. She make him work toward having a caring and lasting relationship. Apart Summer and Gabriel are amazing people, but together they are superb. With one glance they know when the other person is upset or hurt by something or someone. Summer's only conflict is telling her boss she wants to leave the agency. She has been an agent for the past five years, but the enjoyment of the job has worn off. Summer is ready to settle down and have a family of her own with Gabriel.<br />RENEGADE is a wonderful romantic read, but I feel Ms. Alers should of focused more on Summer's last assignment, but fans of the series will enjoy reading about the blooming romance between this intriguing couple. Still, RENEGADE is a charming, fun, and sensual conclusion to the beloved Hideaway series.	2003-07-28
