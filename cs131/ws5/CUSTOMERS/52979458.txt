The gently told fictional story of the first person narrator, Moose Flanagan, living with his family on Alcatraz Island in the mid-1930s because his father was hired at its famous prison, and because the parents wanted to be near San Francisco and a fictional school for his `special' sister, Natalie.  She has an unnamed disorder that would now be identified as autism.  The setting and its unique benefits and detriments make the story interesting,  The characters, particularly Moose and Natalie and their relationship are warm and welcoming.  While Choldenko never attempts to get into Natalie's thinking (for that, try The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time), her role in the family is clear and appropriate.  Moose seems to have an innate understanding for his sister.  Choldenko has caught the mood of life on Alcatraz nicely and invented engaging young characters.    Her Author's Note at the conclusion gives good insight into a number of characters and/or settings in the story, and helps her reader understand why Natalie rings lovingly true.  Including disabled or `special' characters in children's books is hardly new, but this is a good addition to the body (Yolanda's Genius, Dovey Coe, Joey Pigza books, Absolutely Normal Chaos, Summer of the Swans, etc.)	2005-10-04

I have heard the raves and seen the amazing sales figures. - the hardcover that I was lent is a seventy-something printing.  Enjoying a wild reading ride, I thought for sure I was in for one.  The ride was fun and had some good moments, but for me, anyway, it didn't live up to the hype.  Brown has either very solid sources for the inside scoops of the Christian and Catholic worlds or a very, very vivid imagination, one that works to tie elements together in compelling ways.  I suspect that, in reality, the book is a good combination of the two.  The main characters are enjoyable, the cryptology/symbolism play easy to go along with, and the book-long chase keeps the tension going.  I am sure I am not alone at feeling good about having solved a couple of the `puzzles' before the characters did.  A strong point was the interplay of the characters, the paired relationships and those of the secondary characters, too.  I ended up feeling like I'd had fun in an Indiana Jones sort of way, but didn't feel any great need to read another of Brown's books.  I think I will stick with my usual wild rides, Ludlum and Thomas Perry.	2005-09-25

If it's tough to write a phenomenal novel, this novel `reduction,' all the components reduced to their most basic and delicious levels, is surely a reading piece de resistance.  The prose is effortlessly brilliant, the characters and their relationships works of art, particularly Lenny and George, the main characters.  The descriptions of settings and the way they're used to set mood are mental beacons of clarity and brightness.  The use of foreshadowing, SOMETHING bad is going to happen, causes a most compelling tension in the reader.  In particular, the relationship of George and Lenny, which follows the unstated male rules about explaining or defining relationships between men, needs not an iota more from Steinbeck to be manifestly candid.  Beauty, grace, pleasure, and awe in just over a hundred pages; I am grateful, indeed, to the young man who recommended it to me.	2005-09-10

Then, a shipwreck leaves Pi on a lifeboat with no other humans but more than one former member of his father's menagerie.    Survival on his own is imperative.  Doing so on an unforgiving sea with fellow passengers who might well construe him as a potential meal is seriously problematical.  Since Pi tells the story in first person voice, obviously he survives, but what a journey!  The journey's amazing.  Pi's knowledge of animals proves lifesaving.  If you're like me, the first half, before the shipwreck has enjoyable philosophical moments, but lasts a bit too long.  It's worth getting through to the shipwreck.  Be prepared to hold on tight with Pi.  The ending is a most pleasant surprise, casting upon things a perspective I hadn't considered.  A lovely read, all in all.	2005-08-29

The focal characters, brothers Prosper and Bo, run away together to avoid being separated.  In Venice, they are welcomed into a group of homeless children by a girl,  Hornet, who brings them to the group's hideout and introduces them to The Thief Lord, a somewhat mysterious fellow who provides for them even though he is adolescent himself.  The hows and whys of his providing become clear as the story progresses.  The youngsters encounter more than one adult who proves to be of good character, but they meet up with some who most definitely are not of sterling character.  The youngsters' interactions and relationships ring very true.  The fantasy elements which appear late in the book give good cause to consider the old maxim about being careful what you ask for.  There are well-drawn characters engaging in frequent adventures.  This will definitely hold a middle school reader's attention well.  I will be looking for other works of Funke's, anticipating that they'll be good, too.	2005-08-16

Much of the tale is Etsuko's first-person flashbacks of those times.  This is not an action story, but a delicately written character study, etched with Japanese precision and with clear lines, but no unnecessary elaboration.  Ishiguro says it clearly and sharply, but kindly lets the reader make connections.  The way he presents Japanese social propriety, but allows the underlying mood and intent to show brings the reader fully into the story and characters.  Terrific writing and worth the read.	2005-08-16

Santiago, referred to simply as `the boy' for virtually the entire story, goes through a series of travels, with his flock of sheep in Spain and to North Africa and so on, and along the way meets a number of fascinating people.  The writing is gentle and the ideas, spiritual or religious or lifetime philosophical, give one pause to ponder often, and are, in many ways, the highlight of the book, the thing that makes it so well worth reading.  If the measure of a book is its bringing you to see things in a different way, this one succeeds gently and thoroughly.  If it's to tell an interesting yarn, this does it well for a significant portion of the novel, but fell a little bit short with an ending I thought disingenuous.  I would, nevertheless, comfortably recommend it to someone who enjoys thought-provoking reading as a part of his or her \\"Personal Legend.\\"  (As explained warmly in the book.)	2005-08-02

Harry, Ron, and Hermione have reached age sixteen and their penultimate year at Hogwarts.  There's little room for the mischief in many of the earlier books, although romance and jealousy normal for that age transpire.  Are any of the three heroes involved?  You betcha!  But the supremely evil Dark Lord (this generation's Darth Vader to Harry's Luke Skywalker) has reared his ugly head, even including Muggles, non-wizards, in his malicious doings.  The usual separation of who is a good guy and who is a bad guy continues with more specifics, with the glaring exception of one who may be good or evil depending upon which character is discussing that one.  Many earlier threads influence what's going on here and many are referred to.  The book can stand alone, but some of the references to events of the earlier books would be missed.    There are the good fun things, quiddich matches and bizarre animals, but more hexes and spells and potions that often come to play in contexts other than the classroom.  Scary things happen regularly and more than one character gets hurt or worse.  The long and short, Rowling sets up book seven and the conclusion with terrific foreshadowing and character situations.  As good as any of the others and worth reading - Rowling conjures a most wonderful spell upon her readers..	2005-08-02

He is unable to participate in the village's main industry, mining stones and making the finest weapons and tools from them.  He ends up befriending a woman and child outside the village and eventually the three of them return to the village.  The story focuses on change, how that youngster's disabling incident changes his life on a personal level, but every bit as much, how the changes of the world come to affect the village and its main industry.  The village is a conservative, hard-working place, but the boy's inability to participate leads him to develop skills he would not have otherwise, most notably, storytelling.  A fine story on the surface, the deeper levels flow well, how one's life events affect one's life and how external events can affect local ones, as well as considering in what ways that stone-age village parallels many things happening nowadays.  A good yarn, but just as much, this provides many reasons to ruminate thoughtfully on the characters and events and on life's journey and its influences.  I am glad I read it.  You will be glad, too, when you do.	2005-08-02

Charlie is 'endowed' as is the paternal side of his family. (Making him a mudblood?  Oops, wrong story).  Charlie's paternal family members are progeny of the long ago Red King, whose ten children divided into good and evil cohorts, traits which continue through Charlie and others with the king's blood.  No doubt needless to say, Charlie is a good guy.  He finds more than one fellow endowed good guy and takes on members of the evil side in a curious child uh stealing?  napping?  giving-away?  This child, a girl, ends up being Charlie's age, and probably at the new school to which he's sent.  No, not Hogwart's -- Bloor's, where Bloors are real people of doubtful integrity.  Charlie also has non-endowed friends, a neighbor boy and some classmates.  The big future challenge is set up for sequels.  It's not a matter of fighting Lord V... but of finding Charlie's father, presumed dead by his mother, but contrary possibilities have arisen.  It's good fun, fantasy and maybe a bit easier than the series it's not.  I can see why that  fifth grader likes it, recommended it, and lent me her copy.	2005-06-05

They're alive, but the beginning four have one member who is delusional as a result of the traumas of getting from the shipwreck to the island, and three who work in terrific cohesion to establish life-sustaining routines.  The characters are good, as in the first book, but the island lends itself to better imagery without the burden of maritime vocabulary of the first book.  As in the first book, a considerable amount of toleration for wildly unlikely occurances is necessary.  It turns out that the island is not as deserted as the four think, and they witness crimes, deal with wild animals and general survival, and confront evidence of human occupation of the island in the past, among other things that strain credibilitly.  Assuming that one overlooks these strains, and Korman makes it easy for the reader to do so, the book is good fun, maybe more enjoiyable for an upper elementary reader than the first book and it can be read independent of that first one.	2005-05-15

Kit, or Katherine, raised in then-unconventional, but now more common philosophy of girls being capable and independent-thinking, must establish herself in a new place with more rigid limits for girls and thinking, in this case, a colonial Connecticut town.  Like many Newbery-recognized books, this one has a child orphaned.  When orphan Kit's grandfather dies in their Barbados home, Kit turns to her aunt and uncle in New England.  With colonial politics becoming volatile and weather and Puritan philosophy dicatating a very different lifestyle than she's used to, Kit's good intentions stir up nothing but controversy.  Fortunately, they also create some bonds which support her through controversies.  Underlying themes of prejudice, witch hunting, slave ownership and class distinction, hard work, and courtship rituals further enhance this pleasant read.  A middle school girl would probably enjoy it a lot.  I would recommend it to a girl at that age, a strong intermediate grade reader, and maybe even into high school.  It would be a valuable read-aloud book to an intermediate grade class working on American history in social studies (fifth grade here).	2005-05-15

A group of disparate youths, your protagonist who chose this ocean sailing excursion of a kind of 'tough love' in response to some legal tangles, a pair of squabbling siblings, the out-of-control rich kid, the athletic poor girl, and the tv/computer geek, are put aboard this vessel to get their acts together.  The captain, a good man who seeks to lead them, is distant, and the obligatory cruel first mate, who actually runs herd on them, finish out the crew.  They sail in the eastern Pacific, and disaster strikes in the form of a storm which changes everything.  Someone dies, maybe some others also, although that's left unclear and this reader suspects others will reappear in books two and/or three.  The characters are drawn clearly and the ship dialogue is, as far as this non-sailor reader can tell, true to life.  A strong middle school reader who was willing to wade through the maritime vocabulary might enjoy this.  The vocabulary would be daunting to a lesser reader.  I will read the next one and see if the thrid seems worthwhile.  I'd recommend it, but with care.	2005-05-15

It's a short, sweet book, but what makes it sweet also makes it not easy to understand.  That's by design.  A boy is visited by ghosts. The one this story focuses on is his uncle, not his first choice of ghosts since his father passed away not long ago.  Anyway, the ghost uncle had a stroke before dying and has not overcome the barriers of expressing himself since joining the hereafter.  He has quirky speech, consistent, but only to himself, and slowly to his nephew.  It is a paradox for the reader, too.  What DID he mean by that?  The nephew takes on helping the uncle with three requests.  He also deals with a bully who has his own issues, and the deceased uncle's wife, who has a new romantic interest  It's good, pleasant, and I'd recommend it, but it's a far cry from Walk Two Moons' wonderfulness.	2005-05-15

They have adapted to their world's major danger, the unseen fire-breathing Gruncher, who is making Billy's leaving the trees impossible because our hero must also avoid it.

This one falls most deliciously into the first group.  McMurtry is a high wire artist, deftly traversing the delicate line between merely quirky characters and exaggerated parody or stereotypic oddity.  He delightfully gives into the latter two here, creating funny situations, particularly for those characters condemned to closed mindsets in the face of novel situations, largely the English gentry put into the rough and tumble old west.

It rose immediately to the short list of the finest books I've ever read.  The only thing keeping it from being the best of the last few years for me is having read The Grapes of Wrath about six months ago.  Yes, it's that good.  Eugenides' clever first person telling of a story by a yet-to-be-born protagonist for the first half of the story makes the story personal and intimate, even though he speaks of others.  The central issues of dealing with life's changes, doing that well and doing that badly (Hm, like Grapes of Wrath), speak volumes.  To mesh with that are the themes of human conflict, war, riot, and sexual roles.  The prose is silk smooth, the story interesting at its surface level, but dazzling under the surface.  Cal/Callie is a character of immediate interest and on some levels, one with whom both women and men can identify, an unusual quality.  He/she struggles with the issues we all do growing up, but also the addtional ones unique to his/her genetic givens.    Being a contemporary of Cal/Callie's only made it that much better for me.

The history is intriguing and clear - Gordon draws a vivid internal picture of life a thousand years ago, and Rob is an enjoyable protagonist, one with whom it's easy to identify.  The themes which work well beyond enjoyable epic in an interesting setting are those unspoken parallels between life then and now, particularly in the relationships of different religions and regions.  The emergence of modern medicine and the game of chess both have places here.  There's violence that's appropriate for the era, understated but present sexuality, love and family and friends and all the good stuff of life as well as the perils, including more than a few that mercifully are no longer.  It's long, and some of the sidetracks could have judiciously been eited out to make it more taut, but the trip is a good one.  Read it and enjoy it.	2005-05-15

It's a fascinating read.  I am particularly appreciative of the A's attitude to 'think outside the box.'  I came away with a new positive outlook about a few people, player Scott Hatteberg high on that list, and not much respect for others.  Billy Beane's approach works, but I surely wouldn't want to work for such a volatile human being.  It will be interesting to see how Beane's disciples do in Toronto and Los Angeles.  The latter is new, but the former has been going without success for several years.  Many of the young players discussed in the books have just begun making it to the major leagues at this writing (spring, 2005) so that is another aspect to watch, how well everyone's plans and drafts work out.  The tension between innovation - divergent thinking, and conventional wisdom managed to strike a bothersome chord in me.  Philosophically, both are equally appealing to me.  In some places, my profession most prominently, I find that innovation by outsiders tends to be counterproductive, if anything.  In baseball, there's clearly room for it, but I think only to a limited degree.  If Beane's way became the norm, and more than a dozen teams were trying it, the dilution of Moneyball-appealing talent would be damaging to the teams and games, and those teams thinking outside Beane's box would get the productive, more conventional players, probably for less than they could now.  Beane's hit upon a divergent way that works on its small scale, but I suspect only there.  I'm glad I read it.  It was unsettling to my mind in some ways, something I appreciate.  Great, it's not.	2005-05-15

Regrettably, it turned out to be just a pleasant story, of a girl's summer of change from girl to young woman and her relationship with her mute and lost younger brother.  The coming of age theme has been done better (see Absolutely Normal Chaos by Creech), the 'special' younger brother has been done better (see Yolanda's Genius by Fenner), and Byars herself has done better (for this reader, Wanted: Mud Blossom and The Burning Questions of Bingo Brown).

A sweet story of the teacher who comes to an Inuit village and breaks the mold of teachers in its past, this gentle story would be a good one for an early chapter book reader.  The children of the story relate in realistic ways, and bring a diffferent kind of world, one with similarities in people, but differences in environment and a bit of culture.  Agnes' response to the deaf girl who had been routinely ignored by previous teachers is appreciated.  Its focus on how enjoyable learning can be is a good notion to remind a young reader.

This is science fiction, too, taking place in the future in what is now Mexico, but which has become two countries.  The main character, a clone of the patriarch of the more northern of the two countries, is ostracized as a non-person.  Most clones are treated, as we see in the Brave New World-like beginning, by chemicals which destroy their brains.  Matthew Alacran's powerful genetic donor gets around this, and he grows up with faculties intact, and lives both on this patriarch's estate, and on his own of necessity later.  Intriguinging as a story and adventure and trip into the future, it also has significant issues about humanization and dehumanizing forces, and politics and power that make it appealing on a different level to more worldly-wise adults.  A middle or high schooler would enjoy it on more surface levels, including it's coming-of-age theme, but an adult would enjoy it on different ones.

A work of power and grace.  It was a rule-breaking book for me.  Normally, no matter how terrific the book is, I need to feel some connection to one or more of the characters.  The five central characters here were drawn with amazing clarity.  Perhaps more than any writer I know, Franzen captured each one's inner dialogue in totally believable ways.  I still didn't manage to feel connected to any of them, but felt like I understood them deeply and well.  I suppose, then, that without necessarily connecting, I did come to care for them.  The dazzling nature of the clarity of their inner thoughts was matched in one other awesome way.  Franzen's use of figurative language is creative, clever, clear, and thoroughly entertaining.  \\"And the posture of the older oak trees reaching toward the sky had a jut, a wildness and entitlement, predating permanent settlement; memories of an unfettered world were written in the cursive of their branches.\\"  Not only will those two aspects grab and hold you, but you will also share with all of the characters fears, laughs, incredulity, torn allegiances, and the haphazard land mines life unexpectedly drops.  Magnificent.	2005-03-28

Terrific characters, beginning with the first person voice of the story, that most pleasant-to-find one of moral questionability, cruelty and short-sightedness in whom this reader came to find, rather surprisingly, a likable core.  The women are particularly well made, but the males are full-fleshed characters.  The narrator and his lifelong relationship to the DelValle family over nearly a century are the center of a finely wrought novel.  There is enough Latin culture magical realism to complement characters who evoke sympathy, affection, enmity, wonder, and mirth, bringing great pleasure to the reader.  The lifetime changes, which run the gamut from terrifyingly real to the quirkiest edges of reality are the cast's challenges.  Other pertinent themes beyond family and its dynamics include politics, class relations, and more than a bit of 'What goes around comes around' or karmic justice.  I will surely look up her other works, this being my first taste of Allende.    Dazzling, fun, mentally challenging, all the best of reading.	2005-03-28
US	52979458	RTUYMCKY4RVUI	0140386351	724578650	A Girl Named Disaster	Books	5	25	28	N	Y	Wonderfully misnamed heroine	The middle of Farmer's three Newbery Honor books of the last decade, this is different, being historical fiction adventure to the other two's science fiction.  Like The Ear, The Eye, and The Arm, this takes place in Africa, giving it an exotic touch.  Nhamo (Disaster in her native Shona language) is an orphan of sorts, with a deceased mother and absent father, living traditionally in a tribal village in southern Africa.  Through circumstances beyond her own making, she is put in a position of fleeing her home, a not uncommon Newbery theme (see Crispin The Cross of Lead)  For this reader, she partakes in the adventure of a strong, bright, observant, resourceful girl/young woman reminding me of Miyax (Julie of the Wolves), Omakayas (The Birchbark House) and Karana (Island of the Blue Dolphins), high company, indeed.  Nhamo leads a fascinating life, both in the village and after leaving it, including spending significant amounts of time fending for herself.  This is thoroughly enjoyable on many counts, the intriguing cultures, countrysides, and relationships, some touches of spiritualism, the ideas of how to maintain oneself emotionally and physically when isolated, the ideas of perseverance in the face of what appear to be insurmountable obstacles, and flexibility and teaching oneself what's necessary when it's necessary.  Well suited for secondary grades, a very strong reading fifth or sixth grader could enjoy it, too.	2005-03-28

I wasn't expecting something I liked from the spin passage on the back.  After giving it the couple of dozen pages I'd allowed as a try, I found myself wanting to keep going.  It turns out that Mrs. Frisby joins mice Stuart Little and Ralph S. Mouse as an engaging character.  The rats she deals with take on almost science fiction aspects, as escapees from a successful run in a scientist's lab.  They work with Mrs. Frisby to their mutual benefit through a number of challenges.  Bottom line, I liked it enough to finish it fast.  I think girls would identify with Mrs. Frisby enough to take a lot of pleasure in the story, and boys will appreciate the action and danger and various male characters in the story.  The themes of altruism coming back, what goes around coming around, is a good one to encourage acts of kindness in the children.  It would be a good read aloud, and a good book for intermediate grades or middle school.	2005-03-28
US	52979458	R15TXFEGWVTSXX	0395338905	966955750	The Sign of the Beaver	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Historical adventure that works	A long-ago Newbery Honor book, this used-to-be boy found it enjoyable.  Like so many other Newberys, the main character is a young person who finds himself alone without the support of family, in this case, with responsibilties for the newly built family home in Maine around 1770.  Matt is taking care of the home he built with his father before his father left to fetch the rest of the family.  The location is isolated and Matt finds himself having to fend for himself.  He makes understandable, but problem-creating mistakes, and becomes involved in the life of a young Native American from the nearby tribe whose Grandfather rescued Matt from one of his mistakes (trying to get honey).  As historical fiction, it stands the test of time better than Newberys that are contemporary when published, but don't read well a decade or two later.  A young reader willing and able to identify with Matt's situation and adventures is going to find much pleasure here.	2005-03-06

Escher said \\"I can't stop fooling around with our irrefutable certainties.\\"  To say he'd enjoy this, too, is an understatement.  Niffeneger challenges one of our most revered irrefutable certainties, that time is linear and one can only be here, now.  That fun, a character who involutarily travels through time, and his lifelong love are the centerpieces to this tale.  Henry, the time-traveling librarian, and Clair, the love of his life, are intertwined in both time and spirit in the most appealing ways.  Henry has to deal with both the benefits and risks of his unplanned traveling, in which he arrives in a time and place he cannot always identify, and without any worldly possessions (or attire!).  The themes of being different than most folks, or loving someone different, work well and are comfortable to a reader who feels thus.  (And is there anyone else in the world?)  Very cleverly done, bending even the normal rules of time travel fantasy, that one cannot be in the same place at the same time if traveling.  Strongly drawn main characters, some quirky support, and the fascinating time travel scenario blend most enjoyably and smoothly.  Tough to imagine anyone's NOT liking it.	2005-03-06
US	52979458	R2QXX5C0I0F6CW	0440961327	304607356	The Slave Dancer	Books	5	10	12	N	N	Easy reading for those who might best benefit from it	A mid-70's Newbery winner, and a gem.  With Out of the Dust, and Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry, the very finest Newbery has to offer in historical fiction.  The reading level may be late elementary or early middle school, but the content calls for later middle school or high school.  The details of abducting and carrying slaves, their treatment at the hands of their transporters, the crude and often cruel behavior of the ship's crew, and the horrors of shipboard life make the themes tough for sensitive younger readers.  It will provide a young reader with a thoroughly unsettling look at an unseemly part of American history.  The main character, the white boy kidnapped from the streets of New Orleans in 1840 to play his fife to encourage the slaves to dance, is a good, clear, child's view of things, properly aghast and open-minded, the pleasant part of the story and its first person teller.  What Slave Dancer gives is brilliant in its clarity and horror.  I recommend it highly with the caveats above.	2002-10-26
US	52979458	R2Y5B6PHIMCUS9	0590431307	343640191	The Forgotten Door	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Great first science fiction	What a serendipitous find!  At the recommendation of someone who adored it when in fourth grade more than thirty years ago, I was skeptical, but turned out to be more than pleasantly surprised.  I was happy to find this still in print, and can surely understand why it is.  It is a gentle science fiction book, great for fourth grade or reading thereabout, but I fully expect a science fiction-loving fellow teacher will adore it.  Jon, the main character, apparently drops unintended into this world.  He loses his memory in the arriving, but neither his wonderfully idealistic perspectives from home, nor his amazing abilities that transcend what we mere humans can do.  He is, nevertheless, a boy in a strange place and dependent upon the good will of the natives.  That proves to be sadly lacking in some places, but fortunately available in others.  Good, gentle adventure and sterling introduction to science fiction for your young reader.	2002-10-26
US	52979458	R11OH8HDEBPCDX	0884861368	278593479	Life Lessons: An Inspirational Instruction Book	Books	1	5	9	N	N	Savage only to credibility	Without question, Life Lessons is NOT about inspirational instruction, but about avoiding plagiarism through appropriating the thoughts of others and changing just enough words to maintain the wisdom without crediting the rightful source.  Case in point:  Life Lessons page 11 &quot;What lies behind us or before us - are tiny matters compared to lies in us&quot; (unattributed).  Then there are the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes, &quot;What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.&quot;  Do your philosopher friends a favor.  Give them a REAL book of thoughts, one in which the originator is appropriately credited.  This book infuriated me as a person who enjoys good quotes, and galled me as a person with some modicum of ethics.  I will delight in doing something I normally abhor -- tearing off its cover and sending it to recycling, a fate that no book should face, but appropriate for this rip-off.	1998-02-14
