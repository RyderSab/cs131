This autobiography is compulsively readable.  I first saw Kyle Maynard on a TV sports documentary and I'm glad to say that his determination and strength of character comes across as well on the page as it did on the screen.  It also told me a lot I didn't know about the guy, including his success in other sports such as powerlifting and football.  There is also good use of color and black and white photos to illustrate his story.    I almost cried several times whilst reading this book.  Not because it's sad but rather because it states a few simple truths that we all need reminding of.  I particularly enjoyed the way in which Kyle makes his story a tribute not only to his own tenacity but also to that of his family, friends and coaches.  Even simple things like memories of his grandmother taking him to the local park are remarkably touching.    The only time I felt sorry for the author was when he was wrestling in the state finals with a badly broken nose and his opponent starts (illegally) kicking him in the face, out of view of the referee.  It's a testament to him (or perhaps wrestlers generally) that he doesn't complain but just carries on trying to win the match.  I have always felt that wrestling is an all-encompassing activity - a thing in itself - but it really took this book to prove it to me.  You feel like cheering when his much-loved coach rushes out at the end of the contest and raises Kyle onto his shoulders.    I'm the sort of person who skips big chunks of books if I get bored.  But I loved \\"No Excuses\\".  I read every word.	2005-10-08

Instead of charting the progress of her career she instead stages a kind of free-falling description of her life as she tours the rooms of her London house and allows particular objects or photographs to stir memories.    She has a particular gift for storytelling and in describing her childhood. There is a kind of gentle humor throughout which is achieved more by choosing exactly the right word to describe something rather than by jokes. For instance, she imagines a stable of horses as looking \\"like an equine rugby team\\".    Less successful are her attempts at travelog, which seem to take the form of pages culled from her diary. However, overall her technique of darting from subject to subject is enticing as we gain bizarre glimpses into her everyday life (watching tv quizzes in the kitchen) and her philosophy.     This is the most unshowbizzy of memoirs and will find favor with people who enjoy reading biographies generally rather than fans of Absolutely Fabulous, which receives scant mention.	2005-09-12

Cummings: A Biography	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Blissful biography of much-loved poet	Before reading this great slab of a book, I had little idea of who E.E. Cummings was, besides knowing he had an unconventional attitude towards punctuation.  Thankfully, Sawyer-Laucanno manages to shed much light on the poet and his work in a way which is both accessible to newcomers and meaningful to more seasoned Cummings enthusiasts. <br /> <br />In particular, I liked the way in which the author juggles so many competing demands. He had access to a wealth of archive material and Cummings had a long and eventful life.  Yet S-L manages to give play to all aspects of Cummings' activities whilst maintaining the pace and flow of his narrative. <br /> <br />I especially appreciated the almost equal weight given to critiquing Cummings' work as opposed to describing his life.  An analysis of how \\"Buffalo Bill's defunct\\" came into being, based on early drafts of the poem, gives a particularly rare and precious glimpse of how a fully-formed poem is grown from a few choice phrases. <br /> <br />Another dilemma which L-S addresses, is the fact that Cummings was an enthusiastic and successful painter.  It would have been easy to overlook or underplay this aspect but here the paintings are seen as an integral part of Cummings' artistic achievement. <br /> <br />I spotted one or two faults.  I don't think Dylan Thomas would relish being called an English poet - he was a Welsh one - and there is a misplaced bracket (horror!) on p.533.   <br /> <br />I think E.E. Cummings would have appreciated the way this biography manages to find space for a number of small anecdotes aside from the great sweep of the life story.  I loved the description of the humming birds bobbing goodbye before migrating south from Joy Farm.  This was both heart-warming and highlighted Cummings' love of natural history. <br /> <br />Overall, I found \\"E.E. Cummings: A biography\\" to be absolutely compelling.  At first daunted by its length I soon found myself regretting it was so soon coming to an end.  Christopher Sawyer-Laucanno more than meets the challenge of enlightening us about Cummings' life.  He is no mean story-teller and this work is a masterful achievement. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-14

I went to a literary criticism class two-and-a-half months ago, so it would be a neat idea, n'est pas?    Having read Foer's debut novel and seen a few reviews, I was expecting his latest effort to provide an unusual and insightful take on the events and aftermath of 9/11.  And for the first few chapters I wasn't disappointed.  Foer has again created a memorable narrator and his description of Oskar's sense of loss at losing his father made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end.    Unfortunately, having got the reader hooked, \\"Extremely Loud\\" then degenerates into a confusing mess.  Seemingly unrelated narratives begin about a woman losing her voice and letters from someone involved in the Second World War. In fact, instead of shedding light on one of the most tragic events of recent history, Foer just seems to regurgitate the concerns of \\"Everything is Illuminated\\".    In particular, I don't like the style of splicing together two (or three, I got lost pretty early on) stories.  It's just a bargain basement two-for-one approach to novel writing.  I admired Foer's ability to create the authentic voice of an unusual nine-year-old but the mystery of the key-in-the-vase and the letters from Europe just bored and confused me.    Just two stars then.  A disappointment.	2005-06-25

I'd read an extract in a guide to the top 100 books of the twentieth century and was surprised and disappointed not to be able to get my hands on the full edition.    Jansson has an inate understanding of the wisdom and skewed world-view of children, and manages to capture the fragile - and ephemeral - friendship which can exist between the very old and the very young. There is a freshness about her style which never teeters into whimsy. A rare achievement indeed.	2005-06-21

This is a book published for Americans and the shame is that it hasn't been corrected half enough.    The book is indeed witty in places but that doesn't save it from being weighed down by errors and mean-spiritedness.  If you share Queenan's passion for Edward VII, Monty Python and The Beatles you may be able to overlook its faults but I ended up skipping huge chunks.    To give an example, Queenan says he doesn't understand why there is a comedy called \\"No Sex Please We're British\\" running in London.  He then explains he hasn't actually seen it.  If he had bought a ticket, seen the show and perhaps talked to the cast or members of the audience he might have actually learnt something.  That is, he should have tried doing a bit of JOURNALISM.    Sadly he doesn't bother and the book falls flat on its face.  I found it offensive (especially the chapters on Wales and \\"Ten things I hate about Britain\\" - by far the longest bit of the book) and disappointing.	2005-06-18

Growing up with his crazy mother, he finds himself adopted by her even crazier, bible-thumbing psychologist when she finds she can't cope anymore.    Particular scenes remain with me: Augusten and his friend Natalie in a seafood restaurant on Cape Cod and the wonderful chapter where they drench themselves in a waterfall on the local college campus.  These moments are so involving it left me wanting to visit the places themselves:      I moved behind Natalie slightly.  She was better than me at pulverizing her way through normalcy.    And again,    \\"Oh barf.  I am not going to be a writer.  I'd never even get into college.\\"  \\"Sure you would,\\" Natalie said.  And the look on her face told me that she believed this completely and felt slightly sad that I didn't see it and believe it too.    \\"Running with Scissors\\", is all the things the critics have claimed it to be: shocking, hilarious, sharp and intelligent.  I would add that it is something of a landmark in confessional biography.  I really cared about the characters (and shame on those reviewers who claim that Burroughs invented the events he describes).  It is one of the few books, along with \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" and \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\", ever to make me both laugh and cry.  It is amazing and unforgetable.	2005-06-11

From such a modest premise, Helene Hanff has created something with an almost unique charm which continues to endure as a successful book, play and film. <br /> <br />To me the great joy of Hanff is her style.  She is wonderfully conversational, humorous and self-depreciating.  She describes her life - learning ancient Greek or watching endless English films - with panache.  However, in truth very little happens in these pages.  Rather, it is the gently teasing nature of her relationship with Doel which shines out, the feistiness of the young American lady chaffing against the more reserved nature of the quiet, polite English gent, as they read their way through the 1940s, 50s and 60s. <br /> <br />On her death, the London Times said tartly, \\"Seldom has a writer sailed to literary fame in so slender a craft.\\"  It is true that 84 CXR is a very slim tome.  Yet it is one that bears much re-reading, as it seems that somewhere between the lines there lie more than a few life-lessons for us all. <br /> <br />Pilgrims to the real-life 84 Charing Cross Road will be sad to find that it no longer exists as such.  Look out for an \\"All Bar One\\" outlet however and a dull, bronze plaque commemorating the bookstore.	2005-03-06

I love the humor of Portis's book,    COWBOY: I gave some thought to stealing a kiss from you, but now I am of a mind to give you five or six good licks with my belt.    MATTIE: One would be as bad as the other.    And again,    MATTIE: Do you need a good lawyer?    COWBOY: I need a good judge.    This is a heady mix.  The technique of a first-person narrator adds realism and immediacy, which combines with the author's sense of drama and irony to create something quite remarkable.  It is only strange that \\"True Grit\\" should have found more fame on the screen than on the page.    One thing annoyed me and that is hardly the fault of the writer.  The cover blurb states,    \\"Mattie Ross should soon join the pantheon of America's legendary figures such as Kit Carson, Wyatt Earpp and Jesse James\\" (Washington Post)    Well, perhaps, if only she could jump that thin barrier which separates fact from fiction.    \\"True Grit\\" is such a compelling novel that I was genuinely surprised to find that Charles Portis is a living author.  I had supposed it had been written closer to the time in which it is set, such is its sense of authenticity.      It is also unbearably sad as well as funny.  As the older Mattie states, ruefully reminiscing on her young self, \\"time just gets away from us.\\"  Such wryness is more shocking than all the snake-pits, shoot-outs and dying ponies of the early part of the story.    I have a few quibbles.  The two marshals, Rooster Cogburn and LaBoeuff live to great ages (we are told Cogburn lives to 68) when I guess in reality most would have been lucky to reach 40, even if they were not vastly overweight and whisky-quaffing like the hero.  But overall I really enjoyed this short novel and its introduction by Donna Tartt, even if she does not fully acknowledge the importance of Portis to her own work.	2005-02-26

I particularly liked the far-from-lovable grandmother as she picks at a newly-roast chicken to the revulsion of her offspring. <br /> <br />Less pleasing is the almost complete eradication of female characters who aren't love interests for the hero. Mothers figure large in most young people's lives - the most mention Ben's mom gets is that she \\"hasn't returned from work yet\\". <br /> <br />This book is aimed at young (male) reluctant readers but there is enough realism and irony here to cross over to a wider adult audience and enough story-telling ability exhibited by the author to make you wish he had fleshed \\"Wrestling Sturbridge\\" out to a full-blown novel.  <br /> <br />	2005-01-31

This makes the plot sound like any number of dated, school-set stories for juveniles, yet in Forest's hands it becomes something much more ambitious and triumphant as a variety of sometimes quite adult themes are addressed.    Particular scenes stand out in my mind, such as Patrick and Nicola riding over the downs to Wade Minster.  Even simple events like this, which would seem to lack drama, become moments of beauty.  Certain phrases too remain with me: \\"Double chocolate cake had been a wise precaution against hunger before tea\\" and, \\"her voice had the slightly foreign stresses of someone who habitually speaks another language\\".    Such a precise way with words isn't always found in children's books and it's this respect for her readers - and for her characters - which most endears me to her.    In her later books Forest rocks the boat slightly as some unexpected and sometimes unpleasant things happen to the family.  It is as if she has created a fictional and emotionally-involving world for us and then lets it wobble a little on its axis.  However, in EoT the magic of Christmas and more particularly one girl's performance in a nativity play, is allowed to work its power to full effect.    Antonia Forest, beautiful and wise, is one my favorite authors and I think that perhaps \\"End of Term\\" is the best of all her work.	2005-01-14

As the helpful introduction to this work explains, he was living at the end of an era, when the great days of the Wild West and the frontier spirit were coming to an end. <br /> <br />Perhaps above all A River Runs Through It is a hymn to the restorative power of nature. You get the idea that Maclean was not overly impressed with modern life and throughout these stories his voice rings out beautifully, bravely and more than a little sardonically. This a wonderful glimpse of life in the early years of twentieth century rural America.  <br /> <br />	2004-12-13

Unfortunately,  for many people Austen is quaint and reassuring, qualities which \\"The Jane Austen Book Club\\" is most definitely not.    Rather, like my own private Austen, it is cynical, intelligent and more than a little barbed as Fowler introduces us to the six members of the Central Valley/River City all-Jane-Austen-all-the-time book club: Jocelyn, Sylvia, Bernadette, Allegra, Prudie and Grigg.    There were a few moments at the beginning when I felt a little uneasy.  I wasn't prepared for the sex scenes (this is supposed to be Jane Austen territory after all) but Fowler has an eye for detail and I pressed on. Luckily I soon started to warm to the quintet of club members (particularly Grigg) and by the end I felt I wanted to hug them all.  They all emerge fully-rounded and the author seems equally adept at describing the lives of middle-aged Sylvia and Jocelyn as she does the dynamics of teenage friendships amongst Prudie's school students.  She even makes the most prosaic things come alive.  I loved the descriptions of summer evenings on Valley verandas as characters munch slices of Kentucky bourbon cake, creme de menthe squares and almond crescent cookies.    Austen herself even makes an appearance of a kind towards the end to nudge the plot along, in the form of a doctored black magic 8-ball created by the artisitc Allegra.  As the novel closes things become ever more Austen-like as the group hastens towards a happy conclusion.    Fowler's playfulness reminds me of the campus novels of David Lodge, with something of the sensibility of Alice Sebold thrown in, as she mixes the story of the book club with straight-faced accounts of characters' dreams or hobbies and real-life critiques of Austen novels.    I'm still not sure how Allegra managed to find the only taxi driver in Rome who doesn't speak English (has Fowler never visited the city?) or how Jocelyn, working in accounts at a small vineyard, manages to live in the most expensive house, but JABC made me laugh out loud.  It is my book of the year.	2004-12-06

I had imagined that it would be similar to Arnim's endearing \\"Enchanted April\\" but in fact \\"The Jasmine Farm\\" is far more satirical in tone, as a monsterous character called \\"Mumsie\\" conspires to climb the English social ladder.    The plot takes adultery as its starting point but there is much spirited comedy and social comment along the way, as the ettiquette of serving gooseberry fool at dinner and of leaving yellow silk pyjamas in your spare room is explored.     The Jasmine Farm itself is the French hideaway of the genteel Daisy, who bolts there to escape her misbehaving family. Von Arnim then has much fun placing her urbanite characters in rural France.    Critics claim that Arnim's later novels are \\"tired exercises\\" but to me \\"The Jasmine Farm\\", published some 40 years after \\"German Garden\\", is as fresh, (darkly) humorous and stylish as any of her fictions.

He reads Kurt Vonnegut novels and med. school textbooks and gets pissed off when the colleges he visits only ever let him talk to the jocks and coaches, rather than the professors he's read about.    Looking at \\"Vision Quest\\" now, I realise it is a much funnier book than I supposed when I first read it twenty years ago.  Then I was about the same age as Louden and the things he said seemed to make perfect sense.  Nowadays, I can appreciate Davis's irony and the perceptiveness with which he makes Louden very much a teenager in his understanding and world-view.  My favorite Louden comment is his straight-faced philosophising that, \\"having a girlfriend is not all fun and games.  There's responsibility in it too.\\"    I think the reason VQ is enjoyable and bears re-reading even now, is that it does so many different things very well.  Davis covers male bonding, boyfriend-girlfriend relationships, parent-child dynamics and student-teacher struggles.  He also captures Louden's dual-nature, as he switches from moments of seriousness, squinting into an uncertain and potentially dangerous future, with Louden's sudden reversals into kiddish playfulness, as he stuffs his team-mate's mouthguard down his shorts.    As well as capturing the atmosphere of the wrestling-room, literature is also a recurring theme.  We are told about the novels Louden reads, his English class assignments and his graduation thesis.  There is even an analysis of James Agee's \\"Knoxville Summer 1915\\".  This is is done so seamlessly and with such relish that it made me want to run out and buy these books too.    For me, this a rare example of a completely successful novel.  It has not dated (except for a kind of 1960s wonder over racial equality) and Davis has a sharp ear for the dialog, name-calling and absurdity of teenagers.  It takes wrestling as a starting-point but is startling in its lack of violence or agression.  Rather, it is tender, humorous and poignant, gaining its power from the clarity and truth of its depiction of adolescent life.  Terry Davis succeeds in making us care about Louden and Carla, who end up seeming much more than mere fictional characters.  Novelists of any stature can hope for little more.	2004-11-02

The story centers around Nicola, Lawrie, Ginty and Patrick as they spend a school holiday inventing a kind of Dungeons and Dragons fantasy adventure, inspired by Ginty's interest in the Bronte sisters.    The title gets its name from a room in an out-house on the Marlowe estate, which was used by their elder brother as a kind of hide-out.  As usual the dynamism of teenage friendships is well handled, with Forest's ear for dialog and eye for detail very much in evidence.  However, the strucutre of the story is a new departure for Forest, as she includes the children's fantasy story in excerpts, interwoven with later chapters of the book.  This is innovative but if, like me, you dislike fantasy-style novels you end up racing past these sections (or skipping them entirely) in an effort to get back to the main plot.    Overall, this is up to the standard of previous books in the series but sadly, due to my skipping large chunks, I felt as if I had only got half a paperback for my money.	2004-11-02

The good news is that I did.  The Hardy Boyz manage to put across their contrasting personalities and it was fun learning about their early life and first steps into pro wrestling - they've certainly earned their dues.    The structure of the book works well.  Matt and Jeff take turns to tell their experiences so it's as if you're reading a magazine interview with them.  The photos are great too.  A picture of Jeff jobbing for Razor Ramon before he got trendy with his street image, is worth the cover price alone.    On the downside, the long descriptions of individual matches towards the end of the book get a bit tedious but overall this is an exciting, informative guide to the Hardy brothers.	2004-11-01

He has a gift for describing childhood and a kind of relentless honesty which is hilarious and provides something of a turbulent rollercoaster ride for the reader, as he describes the trauma of being a single child to a single parent in the aftermath of the Second World War.    I felt a little left behind by many of the historical and literary references James makes but this is more than made up for by the relish with which he uses the English language. For example, he describes a friend's mother giving him buttered bread covered with hundreds and thousands as like \\"eating a slice of powdered rainbow\\".    \\"Unreliable Memoirs\\" made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end - I wish I had read it years ago.	2004-10-25

Thompson's paperbacks caught my eye.  It's a tenuous link but a friend of mine was an extra in the film adaptation of \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\", so I picked up a copy of KoF and was blown away.    Right at the beginning where Thompson describes a childhood meeting with the CIA and again at the end when he's involved in a motor crash, the author writes what I can only describes as perfect prose,    \\"All these things have happened and probably they will happen again.  I have learned a few tricks along the way, a few random skills and simple avoidance techniques - but mainly it has been luck, I think, and a keen attention to karma, along with my natural girlish charm.\\"    I have no interest in drugs, fast cars or pimps yet, as with all great writers, it hardly matters what they take as subject matter since they have you in the palm of their hands.  Thompson not only tells you about his mad life, he takes you there.  This is a classic of non-fiction writing, gonzo journalism at its peak.	2004-10-03

Here she provides a twist to the (too easy) choice of a childhood memoir by focusing on a play put on by her high school drama class and links it with the current vogue for quest-based books by attempting to relocate her co-stars in a kind of \\"friends reunited \\" adventure. <br /> <br />The structure of the book - a series of vignettes as she meets various chums of long ago - plays to Toksvig's strengths as she deftly outlines characters and finds the humor in some absurd social situations. <br /> <br />She clearly embarked on something of a spitiual journey in trying to reunite the Gladys Society and it is a testament to her skill as a writer that she is able to take her readers along with her.	2004-10-03

It is all the more surprising therefore that these final tales show no sign of staleness. In fact, \\"A Peaceful Retirement\\" is quite playful in tone as Miss Read copes valiantly with a series of unlooked-for marriage proposals. <br /> <br />Given that the school year is so regular the author manages to describe events such as Christmas celebrations and harvest festivals with no sense of repetition, and as ever captures the tensions between town and country living, children's and adult worlds and men and women beautifully.  <br /> <br />With this book Dora Saint, the real-life Miss Read, can take her own retirement from authorship knowing that she has served her readers well.  <br /> <br />	2004-09-29

However, a recent visit to Utah (and a museum display in a Burger King branch) triggered my interest in the \\"Code Talkers\\".    Japanese photographer Kawano has taken portraits of all the Navajo veterans he could find. These are the native Americans who were recruited by the marines to use their native language in transmissions behind enemy lines in the Far East. It proved to be the only unbreakable spoken code in military history.    These black and white pictures are a poignant and eloquent testament to their heroism. A short introduction and occasional quotes from the subjects help set the context. It is a remarkable achievement, fusing art and history	2004-09-29

Jim Provenzano recreates the world of a gay high-school wrestler and then turns up the heat some by making him an Italian Catholic.    The attention to detail and ear for dialog are perfect, making the novel seem autobiographical. The pace never lets up as the author changes focus from Joey as a friend, to lover, to son, to brother, to team-mate. The reader is seldom wrong-footed and I shuddered slightly as I recognised myself a little in the text.    The cover blurb calls PINS, a \\"full-fledged miracle of writing\\". It's not far wrong.	2004-09-27

Since I always thought Irving was more of a Hardy fan, I found this a little bemusing. <br /> <br />Overall, fans of Irving's longer work will tend to a little disappointed with this outing, though this is perhaps no fault of the author.  <br /> <br />	2004-09-25

However I found the structure disatisfying.  The chapters alternate between the translator and the US hero narrating their adventure in Eastern Europe.  It's almost a bargain basement two-for-one approach to novel writing.  You compose a couple of parallel stories and then splice them together. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the way Foer handled the dynamics of the central relationship in the book, as the two men make an uneasy friendship, but sadly my interest petered out a third of the way through.  There was however enough talent on display to make we look forward to his future books.	2004-09-25
US	46126900	R1ZDSVMET60M2L	0140313095	549102334	The Attic Term (Puffin Books)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Intelligent addition to the Marlow saga	Antonia Forest's novels are always compelling and surprising. In this school-set story the characters variously look after hawks, ride to hounds, discuss comparative religion (at length) as well as wear mini-skirts (this is 1960s England) and watch Star Trek. Such an odd mixture should never hold together and yet in Forest's hands we are drawn into what seems a very real - and sometimes frightening - world.    This is partly because her heroines (and heros) are so well-drawn. Even the most minor character is fully-thought through as if the author has created a whole world in her mind of which we glimpse only part. Here Nicola (rather than her more flighty twin Lawrie), Ginty and Patrick take center stage, with girls such as Tim and the older Marlows playing only minor roles.    I much prefer Forest's school-based stories (of which this is the fourth and last) rather than novels such as Peter's Room, which have ironically tended to win more praise. Here Forest uses the device of a carol concert to add structure and forward impetus to the plot, much as the Christmas nativity play did in an earlier tome. However, this takes up comparatively little of the book and the main focus is on Ginty and Patrick's burgeoning romantic relationship. This is well-handled, but is a distinct change in tone from previous works.    Although I enjoyed this book, there are certain jarring notes. The end in particular is unsatisfactory (why does Ginty not want to spend the Christmas holidays with Patrick?) and the au pair Claudie speaks a variety of English I have never heard any French person using.    But I love Forest's choice of phrase (\\"Patrick's mind had hung up a 'do not disturb' sign\\" - we all know how that feels) and her range of topics is masterful. She can cope with describing religious arguments, team sports, the dynamics of friendship, school, family, teacher/pupil relationships, music and drama with ease.     It is significant that she originally aimed to be an adult author and only took up the Marlow saga when her first manuscripts were rejected. It is as if she is using the framework of the school story to play with all her (considerable) intellectual preoccupations. Her work is eminently readable and re-readable. Tantalising glimpses are given both of previous books and possible future Marlow adventures (Ann as head girl, the twins as sixth formers) which were, sadly, never written.	2004-09-18
