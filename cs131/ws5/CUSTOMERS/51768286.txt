That's how this book should have been titled.<BR>There is a lot of information for the book of 350 pages...<BR>Every IP routing protocol is explained in great detail. RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP... All the usual suspects. There is even a chapter on MPLS. Unlike most other publishers, this one did not bother to add &quot;fillers&quot; and &quot;padding&quot; to this book to make it to appear more valuable than it really is. In other words, you are not buying a brick-sized door holder here. <br />Information is communicated in concise and clear manner. In fact, a lot of it is watered down to make it easier to understand.<BR>Here is how the chapters are laid out: <BR>Ch.1 Static Routing (from static to default, to load balancing<BR>and route maps), <BR>Ch. 2 Dynamic Routing Protocols (all the fundamentals of dynamic routing), <BR>Ch.3 RIP (RIP and RIP-2), <BR>Ch. 4 IGRP (just about enough to refresh your memory on that one, since it's an older routing protocol),<BR>Ch. 5 EIGRP (a lot more information there),<BR>Ch. 6 OSPF(about 60 pages of very good info on OSPF),<BR>Ch. 7 IS-IS (this is invaluable since there is not that much info on this protocol is out there).<BR>Ch. 8 BGP (Surprisingly, a very extensive coverage of this protocol),<BR>Ch. 9 MPLS (Good info on this latest technology),<BR>Each chapter ends with a configuration and maintenance section.<BR>All and all good value for the money.	2004-01-09

If you are ready to take it beyond the CCNA level, I would also look into getting the following books:<br />1. &quot;Cisco IOS for IP Routing&quot; by Andrew Colton. A lot of information on IP routing protocols (EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, etc.).<BR>2. &quot;Routing TCP/IP, volume I&quot; by Jeff Doyle.

This book does a good job in explaining the basics of Cisco routing. Just about enough to get you to the CCNA level as far as theory. The language is a little drier than in the Lammle's book. Therefore, a complete beginner may find it more difficult to comprehend the material.

Good basic info on Cisco networking in general and the CCNA exam in particular. &quot;Cisco IOS for IP Routing&quot; by Andrew Colton (ISBN 0972286209) would take you much further in understanding the IP routing protocols.
