Books	2	44	49	N	N	Good as a companion to another method	This is primarily a book on chord progressions. Starting with the most popular chords used in music, and then moving to other chords in open in barre position. Interspersed here and there are some tips on playing guitar. Not much more than that, and not very well organized. <br /> <br />I would consider this most beneficial as a companion to lessons or to a complete method found elsewhere. There just isn't much to it. It's 80 pages, but each page generally contains two 4-chord progressions. I also found that several of the chords listed are inaccurate -- or at least inconsistent with several other sources I checked them against. <br /> <br />I've used about 6 different books and software on learning the guitar, and I found this to be the least helpful. But there are some great reference diagrams that I still refer to, and as it is entirely focused on popular progressions, it finds a home being used in conjunction with another book.	2005-01-06

After about 5 reviews, they become quite redundant, and many are nitpicky. Most web sites reviewed made the same common mistakes, which are harped on throughout the book. I stopped reading them after about 15, and then just skimmed the most popular ones thereafter. <br />Repeated at least 20 times are these themes:<br />* Title your pages appropriately<BR>* Get a good tagline<BR>* Provide example content on the homepage, not just links<BR>* Write headlines as succinctly as possible, while retaining greatest possible meaning<BR>* Have a search box available<BR>* Categorize links and sections appropriately<BR>* Use good labels<BR>* Use images wisely, and not gratuitously<BR>* Beware of ads, and anything looking like them<br />Readers of \\"Designing Web Usability\\" won't find nearly as much substance in this book, but Nielsen fans won't be disappointed. He certainly is consistent!	2003-08-19

Rather than focus on the mechanics of the Unified Process, as one might expect, the author presents justification for transitioning from a traditional software engineering approach to an iterative approach.<br />Conventional software engineering is first presented, along with its drawbacks. The changing software landscape is examined, and future success factors are identified. The factors are then tied into the new process.<br />Thorough coverage of many different angles, including an excellent section on metrics, estimation models (and the evolution of COCOMO), team development, culture changes, etc.<br />Great read.	2003-08-19

This text sits in the heart of the rigorous, waterfall approach.<br />Iterative approaches are proven to be more effective at eliciting requirements, a fact which is somewhat embraced in the author's discussion of use cases; however, Jacobson originally envisioned use cases to replace other requirements documents as a central element in elicitation, rather than just being a quick diversion.<br />In reality, most of us strike a middle ground. Projects can't be run in most organizations without rigor, and Software Requirements is a thorough treatment or requirements development and management. The well-organized book is a quick read, and is filled with prescriptive advice, risks, sample forms, and checklists that can be applied to your requirements effort. No wonder the author won a Software Productivity Award for the effort!	2003-07-28

Developers and project managers alike will shine by adding automated build, test, and reporting tools to their repertoire, and I certainly can't complain about that.<br />I would have expected a more thorough job of tying the tools back to Extreme Programming, but those not interested in XP or those already familiar with XP will appreciate the &quot;down to business&quot; style. Much of the sample code is too simplistic to be helpful, and I found the case study to be much less valuable than others have suggested, but both provide enough context to whet one's appetite. Most of these tools have excellent documentation anyway, and this book serves its purpose well: an adequate introduction to some great productivity tools.	2003-07-23

The first 200 pages were JBuilder-specific, well written, and they got me up to speed quickly with using the enterprise edition. The rest of the book was not at all helpful - I bought the book to learn to use JBuilder effectively, and learn some tips and tricks from those who have been using it for some years, not how to use JDBC and IO.<br />I also found the section on JBuilder's data-aware components to be severely lacking. JBuilder obviously has a robust toolset, and a quick explanation of two of the provided components was inadequate. The inconsistency in the \\"In Practice\\" sections was also disturbing. A product of several authors, but it would have been too easy to notice and solve this problem to be forgiven.<br />All that said, the book is well written and organized, hence the 3 star rating. But beware of the stated intended audience and book content before you buy.	2003-07-01

Perhaps I misunderstood the title, but I hope to save you from doing the same. This book contains no best practices - only a very general (and incomplete) overview of the project management process.<br />I would have expected to see a book heavy on &quot;practice&quot; considering the book's title, but the book is mostly theory at a very high level. The book has more of a dictionary feel than anything else. The project management process is presented, and each area in the process is defined (at least partially). <br />Sections on release management, configuration management, and problem resolution were under a page long. From the description and other reviews, I was really expecting to find some meat in these areas. For that matter, most of the chapters were rather light on content - again, not what I would expect in a &quot;practice&quot; book.<br />A few other notes:<br />* The writing style is rather dry - not academic, but more corporate process team. <BR>* The quality of the book materials, binding, typography are excellent. <BR>* Resources for further reading are poor.<BR>* Some excellent graphics: CRUD matrix, process overview, status report template (it's for this reason that I didn't give it a one star)<BR>* Case studies were poor: they seemed to have no ties to the chapter in which they were presented.<br />In a nutshell, for a very high-level overview of project management theory, this book will prove beneficial. If you have a background in project management, or are familiar with the process, or are looking for infomration you can put to work, this is not the book for you.	2003-05-12

The book is organized around Sun's 310-080 exam objectives, and the authors tackle each objective in turn - clearly and succinctly.<br />If you don't have experience using J2EE, you can't expect to pick up the book and understand everything you read. Nor should you want to - what would be the point of certification if that were all that it took? If you have hands-on experience already, this guide will serve up bite-sized chunks of refresher information that will prepare you incredibly well for the exam (98 here).<br />The index was also refreshingly useful. Although this is a study guide, I still like to keep it handy when I need answers fast. Highly recommended.	2003-05-07

My primary complaints:<br />* The book is little other than the help section and tutorials repackaged.<BR>* Even what has been repackaged is unclear. The authors do little other than describe procedural steps.<BR>* No added value one would expect in a book like this, e.g. tips or tricks, hidden features, etc.<BR>* This is a book on Sun One Studio, not Java. The authors should have realized this, and left out the poor Java examples and explanations.<br />All of that said, the value that this book provides is that it *is* a book! I'm a reference book kind of guy, and I like to have this information at my fingertips, perhaps with several books open on my desk at any one time. You can't always do that with online help. That is the book's saving grace.	2003-04-01

I was expecting much more. It's less best practice, and more typical web app development. What disappointed me further was various comments in the text that displayed poor practices in areas outside of JSP web development, e.g. &quot;the first step in developing a jsp web application is designing the user interface.&quot; <br />My one-star rating can be summarized as follows:<br />* Poor typesetting and book formatting: -1<BR>* Very few &quot;best practices&quot; -2<BR>* Below average writing, low content-to-price tag ratio -1	2003-04-01

I read Hall's &quot;More Servlets and JSP&quot; after reading Sams JavaServer Pages Application Development, and Wrox JSP Web Development. Whereas the Sams book provided some great insight on a smattering of topics (in their usual style), and the Wrox book provides a lot of useful information out of context, Hall presents a lot of useful information, in an easily digestible format, and in proper context. <br />This book is also filled with the &quot;gotchas&quot; that usually take trial and error to uncover. It's not a regurgitation of the API or other documentation. Hall also covers some of the deployment intricacies in greater detail than I've seen in other texts. <br />All in all, this is an excellent book that I expect to keep on my frequently accessed shelf. I will be looking for more Hall publications in the future.	2003-03-25

A lot of relevant anecdotes from some experienced engineers, but it wasn't as useful as I hoped. Sometimes, quitting is not the answer!

I assumed that a &quot;complete J2EE reference&quot; would dispense with the typical introductory concepts, and move directly to advanced topics, but that is not the case. <br />The author writes well, and clearly, but wrote for the wrong audience. It also appears as if some deadline pressures dramatically influenced the construction of this book. For example, several chapters are devoted to explaing JDBC in painstaking detail, right down to constructing SQL statements. These are topics that I would expect anyone picking up this book to already know. Later in the book, topics like EJB, RMI, or JMS received very few pages.<br />I should also point out that the book is roughly 550 to 600 pages -- pp. 700+ are appendices, and 100 to 150 pages of the text are &quot;quick reference guides,&quot; which fall far short of API documentation. As mentioned elsewhere, the accuracy of the code samples is laughable. Errors are so frequent that I passed the irritated and disturbed stages early on, and quickly moved to amused. C'mon, when 50% of the already limited code samples have errors, you have to chuckle!<br />The good point about this book is that it provides an accurate birds-eye view of J2EE, and can be used by anyone to learn how the various puzzle pieces fit together. J2EE is vast, and the book can help you navigate to the specific subjects that you want to drill down into.	2003-03-16

The field attracts those who (there is no way to say this kindly) have rather dry writing styles, but this was more accessible than most.<br />The book focused on preparing for a CM system, and provided adequate food for thought on some of the relevenat topics. However, details of implementation, and actual CM system use were neglected. Also would have been nice to include some appendices providing model CM plans and model suporting processes / procedures, but the book did provide a thorough list of resources.<br />All-in-all, a quick, accomodating read.

Anyone working in a team environment knows that the code examples won't fly, but the reasoning behind the code and the flow of the code are certainly competent.<br />Before reading, you should already have an ASP / VBScript background, although the first few chapters did provide some basics--but not nearly enough for a newcomer to get a firm grasp of the subject.<br />I found the book very valuable, and I picked up some great tips from the code examples. I placed numerous dog ears at pages where the code was much more efficient than mine.<br />Great value. Always good to have some e-commerce expertise in your bag of tricks.	2002-04-13

But more importantly, pay attention to part of that word: DESIGN. Workflow is most relevant on large projects, but how many large projects do you know that only focus on design? I've seen none--there is always a development aspect to the larger projects, even if it's integration with an exisitng system. There is a big black hole in this book that the authors do not cover--I was pleased that they pointed this out to the reader several times.<br />The content is valuable, and the text is well-written and easy to read. A lot of helpful checklists, forms, and questionnaires throughout the book. Valuable information for newcomers, to be sure. But anyone with experience in formal methodologies, or experience in mid to large-scale development efforts will find this a rehash of that which is already known. I would, howver, recommend this highly to anyone new to web application development and consulting.	2002-04-01

This book is not about writing copy or online content, contrary to how it sounds.<br />Nonetheless, the book is clearly written, and might even prove helpful to the right audience. The right audience would be anyone &quot;brand spanking new&quot; to the ways of the web, with little to no knowledge of page design and usability. Yes, page design and usability--like I said, this book is not about writing content.<br />I was hoping for a &quot;best practices&quot; guide with some examples of good and bad text. There are 30 to 40 pages of text devoted to this topic. Another 40 to 50 pages are devoted to usability concerns--please note that these have been adpated directly from some well-known usability authors like Jakob Nielsen and Steven Krug, known to be at opposite ends of the usability spectrum!<br />Another 50 to 60 pages were devoted to search engine placement. Again, nothing earth shattering. If you've been exposed to the web, and have some basic knowledge about the innerworkings of engines, the tips won't add any value. Anohter 20 to 30 pages on misc. topics like what businesses might do well on the web. About 50 pages of pure fluff--I guess a sub-200-page book wasn't acceptable? <br />At the end of the book are some useful checeklists. All-in-all, the content of the book is good for newcomers to the web, but I'm thoroughly disappointed that the text matches neither the title nor the description.	2002-03-17

Admittedly, XML is not a mature technology, and a thorough treatment (or even introduction) to the changing landscape of XML is a challenge. But this book fell far too short of its goal.<br />Too many inconsistencies to ignore. Many &quot;refer to&quot; captions where the code or screenshot did not match the comment. Some supporting information was only depicted in these missing items, so of course, the reader was left with no context for the caption.<br />Too many code samples that did not work. Speaking of code samples, this book had the smallest amount of samples I've seen in any of the &quot;21 Days&quot; books I have read (6). The code samples included did not begin to describe the text of the book. For example, in the DOM chapter, the author listed roughly 20 properites and 20 methods--yet only two properties, and one method were shown via code samples. Thoroughly disappointing. Further, the author chose to describe only Microsoft's implementation of the DOM! Odd, yes, even odder when you read below that in a later chapter, the author eschews the parser he already told you to download so he can explain the SAX in Java.<br />Let me intersperse a semi-positive comment in the sea of negative ones. The author is clearly a good writer--sentences are well-constructed, and the author is good with words. Unfortunately, he is not as good at instructing.<br />Another problem--the book was published in August 2001, but is already out of date. How can this be? Obviosuly, many chapters were written long ago, and were not rewritten to address any new specifications or emerging standards. While DTD's and XDR are still used, I feel that XSD should have been covered in much more detail--after all, it's the W3C's recommendation, so it should be emphasized. <br />Another general annoyance: I got sick of seeing text like this: &quot;we haven't covered these features, but. . . &quot; when commenting on the sparse sample code provided.<br />Chapter on SAX: useless to me. Why? I don't know Java. Instead of using the MSXML parser used throughout the rest of the book, the author chose to use Sun's Java parser for the SAX chapter. I have no clue why. Plenty of code samples in this chapter--kudos! In fact 65% of the chapter was samples--too bad I don't know Java.<br />Scope was also a problem. For example, namespaces is an easy concept to understand, but the author spent 15 pages explaining them. XSD, a little more difficult to understand, but didn't receive much more attention.<br />I could go on, but I will spare you. Postive side: author is clearly a good writer, and some chapters were top notch. But the inconsistencies were disturbing--detail, skim, detail, skim. In the author's defense, this is an evolving topic, and a thorough, current treatment is next to impossible. I suspect that only Wrox's multiple author approach could do XML justice at this stage of the game.	2002-03-13

VID Unleashed is the best book I have read on VID6--hands down. Competent chapters on the scripting object model, the VID data environment, and the database and query designers. Several hundred pages of good reference material on the SOM, HTML, DHTML, ADO, etc. Good stuff. <BR><BR> My only complaint is that there is an obvious switch from one writer to another between chapters.	2001-11-27

Unfortunately, the author couldn't decide to whom he was writing. One minute I'm bored with a &quot;hello world&quot; snippet, and the next I'm frustrated with a (too complex for a beginner) non-functioning scriplet. Visual Interdev has a lot of slick features, but this book did very little to emphasize them--too much time was spent introducing new concepts and technologies, and not enough time was spent on the guts of a great application. That being said, I would have rated this higher had the book at least done a good job introducing the aforementioned technologies--but it fell short in that, too. Spend a little more time, and read Visual Interdev Unleashed--great chapters on the data environment and the scripting object model, as well as some good reference material.	2001-11-27
