When I picked up \\"The Heart of a Teacher\\" I expected more of the usual teacher gift books that grace my shelf (and sometimes my trash can ;-). As a teacher of many years, I would trade all the other books that expound the greatness of teachers for this one thought provoking book.  <br /> <br />What makes The Heart of a Teacher different?  <br /> <br />This compilation of stories truly represents the \\"heart\\" of the best. There are no platitudes or sweet quotes. Each story challenges the reader to grow closer to the Master Teacher.  <br /> <br />The authors range from well known writers to everyday folks willing to share what God has revealed to them. Pick up a copy of this beautiful book. You won't be disappointed.  <br /> <br />Actually, pick up several. You won't be able to keep it to yourself.	2005-10-13

Her style will prove to be a classic of our day. Her poetic words entice until you become part of this adventure of suspense, romance, tragedy and, thankfully, a bit of comic relief.    The lives of Lance and Rese intertwine in unseen, multifaceted ways. Rese, hardened by her past, seeks peace in opening a bed and breakfast where the land gives life to wine. Lance pursues a mysterious family quest while serving as her chef/maid/gardener. He voices her thoughts before she feels them, but is he real? Is the God he shares real? Two needy people searching.        Along the way, there is a long-lost diary, a skeleton, and a seductress... along with a dog who rides a motorcycle (not by himself, of course ;-), an elderly neighbor with watchful eyes and heart, and tempting Italian cuisine.       It's an amazing journey. Go for it!	2004-08-31

The first book, A Rush of Wings, is also quite good and will help you understand the characters in The Still of Night.

Killian's once beloved husband has turned into an abusive, jealous man. Under the threat of another violent attack, Killian and her 5 year old son flee into a foreign land, exchanging a dangerous situation for one of unknown peril. Set in Scotland in 1691, the history and culture are rich with tradition, feuds, and castles. <br />While this period in history had not been my typical choice in fiction, I had been impressed with the author's Brides of Culdee Creek series. I was pleasantly rewarded with a enthralling tale of mystery and love. Morgan's versatility as an author is<BR>astounding. Morgan has a gift in weaving a story that exposes the soul of its characters, draws in the reader and wraps them in authentic culture and history. At the same time, the story presents the way to true, abundant and everlasting life. Amazing. A book worth experiencing.	2003-02-23

A tale of two sisters: one who falls in love with a blind man and one whose romantic interest is blind to her love.

Once aware of  the consequences of his shyness, he turns to God for help. Interwoven subplots reinforce the theme of God's love.<br />This book is written in a style that fits the historical scenario (1812 in the English countryside), but is not as interesting to me as some others by Lori Wick.

The stories and illustrations are fabulous!<br />    Children often find the illustrations in other Bible story books scary or weird. While the illustrations are true to the times in terms of dress, they are exaggerated in size, yet simple. For example, Zaccheus, \\"who was to little to reach high things...\\" is shown as a small man in HUGE chair. (p. 6-7)<br />     The text is delightful! For example in \\"The Boys and Girls and Jesus,\\" the children come to see Jesus as part of families, i.e. \\"Every day lots of daddies and mommies came to hear Jesus talk. Grandpas and grandmas and friends came, too. Some days - there were too many people to get inside a house.

The introduction explains the reasons for our food choices including weather, holidays, location, harvest times, and family traditions. The author uses the simple means of cooking to incorporate a variety of important skills for children. These skills range from learning about healthy eating, kitchen safety, sports nutrition and the changing seasons to spending quality time with family members (including dad!). Children are taught to give of themselves (while also raising self esteem) by making simple holiday food gifts such as honey butter, spice mix, soup mix, or chocolate chip cookies in a jar. Each page is 'jam packed' with simple, healthy recipes and wonderful ideas. This book is a valuable resource for anyone in contact with young children whether a child care provider, parent, grandparent or next door neighbor. <br />P.S.

Lori Copeland's writings are typically light hearted, yet carry a deep message. After reading several serious chapters of this book, I checked the front cover to make sure Lori was the author! It is the story of a young woman, Emma, who believes she has escaped the hurt of her past by running away, making a new life for herself. Fifteen years later, tragedy places her in the center of the pain she sought to deny. Ultimately, the author's typical humor cannot be denied. The addition of humor is equal to the changes in the heart of the characters. An example of this is on page 218, when Sam, the man who jilted Emma long ago, comes for a visit on Christmas morning. It begins with Sam's greeting: <BR>   \\"'How's my girl this morning?'<BR>  'I'm not your girl.'<BR> 'How's my grouch this morning?'<BR> She smiled.\\"<BR>A great read about hurting and healing from God's love and faithfulness!	2002-07-01

Yet, he was always a good, loving person and now he seeks to honor God in his thoughts and actions. He has the support of a caring community. He is not without human temptations, but the fruits of the Spirit are evident. His wife, a Christian before the tragedy, now denies herself the love of God.

FIRST: Although this book is 4th in a series, the story can be appreciated without first reading the other three. (However, the others are excellent also.)<br />INTRO: Each chapter of \\"Child of Promise\\" opens with a scripture, then weaves the story to illustrate the depth of the words that appear simple. In the first chapters, Beth has two great desires - to practice medicine and to become the wife of Noah Starr, the pastor of the local Episcopal church. When Noah marries another, Beth pursues a degree in medicine. Her time studying to be a doctor leaves her bitter, hardened and emotionally scarred. Upon her return home, circumstances put Noah, now widowed, and his disabled daughter in constant contact with Beth. <br />ANYONE WHO READS THIS BOOK IS IN FOR A SPECIAL BLESSING! While the story line appears to be the typical romance genre, the story is far from shallow, typical, or traditional. Kathleen Morgan, the author, goes past \\"happy ever after\\" to the reality of human nature and the relationship of each of us to God, as well as each other.<br />THEMES: This amazing historical novel addresses \\"hot topics\\" such as women in non-traditional careers, dual career families, domestic abuse, disabilities, etc. At the same time, it deals with ageless themes such as love, loss, and anger with God. <br />This book could be read as a study of church relations for everyone who is a member of the clergy, married to a member of the clergy, a leader in the church, a lay person, avoids church due to the hypocrites who attend or knows someone who goes to church. In other words, this is a must read for all. <br />Thanks again, Kathleen Morgan, for allowing yourself to be used by God for my benefit.	2002-03-25

Having read the other reviews here, I am looking at Montclair Homecoming as an individual book rather than a part of the series. The most beautiful part of this book is the story line about Joy's art and the healing that takes place as a result of her using her gift. I have read Valient Bride, the first of the series. I found it interesting to compare the lifestyle of the two brides, given each's time in history. With only a little knowledge of the series, I still found the stories interesting without being caught up in the dates. Peart's writing style reminds me a little of Grace Livingston Hill.	2002-01-03

The &quot;spice&quot; of this book, i.e. suspense, humor, innovative dialog and a most unusual family, makes for a great read. The first chapter had me laughing out loud.

Melissa James, the main character, runs scared from her secret past, leaving her husband with no warning. She finds sanctuary with a Mennonite woman living in a plain community. Her husband, Ryan, is left in the dark. The plot revolves around Melissa and Ryan individually trying to discover what has happened. Individually they are also faced with their relationship (or rather non-relationship) with God. Their love story is revealed in flashbacks. The plot takes many complicated twists, weaving its way to a surprise ending. Just don't read the end first!	2001-06-07

Lady of Light is the 3rd book in the Brides of Culdee series. Just when I think Kathleen Morgan has written her best ever, she comes out with one more. I appreciate the reality of flawed humans dealing with diffucult relationships. I also appreciate the reality of a great God who is ever present.

Not only do they deal with the problems of most newlyweds, but Claire brings along her troubled younger brother and immediately moves to a new country.

I expected the same whimsical, interesting characters at a very special time in the history of Mitford...and was not disappointed. Had it come out as book &quot;2A&quot; in the sequence, it would have been accepted as wonderful as all the rest. In that light, readers pretending not to know anything from books 3-6, will enjoy it greatly. Also, we finally look at things from another view than just Father Tim.  Most interestingly, I believe this book would be good for engaged couples to read. The emotions are real. Giving those emotions to the Lord brings real results.  Due to it's length, it should have been a smaller, less expensive version. Time to go back and read the first two again....	2001-04-17

This book shows sacrificial, agape love in a most interesting way. Meg has always loved Kelsey, even when he was married to her best friend and cousin, DeeDee. In this case, to love is not a sin, to act on it is. In order to avoid her strong attraction for Kelsey, she moves to another continent and becomes a competent business woman. Meg dates several handsome men who adore her, but none can compete. When DeeDee dies, leaving 5 children, Meg doesn't rush home. Two years later, when her mother becomes seriously ill, she returns.     The story line takes many unexpected twists as Meg stumbles through this situation. One may expect this book to take a totally &quot;mushy&quot; turn at this point, but seeking God's will brings His best. Read and see.	2001-01-23

MY SELF, MY FAMILY, MY FRIENDS is a practical and comprehensive guide to young children's self-esteem. As a parent I like the concise chapters, each is complete in itself, yet complimented by the rest of the book. (Remember that most parents are limited by sitting times of 10 minutes or less to read, i.e. the amount of time they can hide in the bathroom!) As an educator, I am impressed by the topics, authors, and the list of resources at the end of each section.

The cover of MARRYING WALKER MCKAY implies it is another cheap, sex-focused novel. Not so. As an author, Lori Copeland has matured tremendously. The depth of the story, with its adorable humor, is captivating. While the romance is not explicit, this book is for more mature readrers. Lori's writings include romance and inspirational fiction. What's the difference? The inspirational fiction has a spiritual component, i.e. her books: June, Glory, Faith, Hope, etc. MARRYING WALKER MCKAY is definitely the BEST of her romance without overt spiritual messages; however, if the reasons for true lasting love were included, i.e. the spiritual, this book would be more real and beautiful.

One comment I would like to see brought out is that Alexsana, the main female chararcter, often acts on her own instinct. Like most humans, she sometimes puts her decisions before the Lord...and at other times, just acts on her own judgement. She often ignores the counsel of Godly friends. She pays a price for this.

The words are gray because Carina's polished world has been tainted and, yet, hope remains. Her stubborn and independant nature leads her to a place where her hopes are dashed (literally and figuiratively), i.e. the background black. As all humans, Carina tries to make her own way, only to find she cannot go it alone. To live fully requires interdependance with God and people. This lesson comes harshly. I highly recommend this book to mature readers as it contains violence. A violence born of human nature not seeking God.	2000-10-18

This book from the Steeple Hill publishers 'Love Inspired' series is a  well developed and well written story of the struggles of contemporary  individuals finding balance in life, i.e. career, family, love,  money, and  most of all, spiritual life. The answer found by the main characters is not  necessarily the right answer for all, but the process of discovery of the  best answer is important. There are a few details that don't quite fit for  me, but it in no way distracted from the point of the story. I can't tell  these details without giving too much away.

This sequel to &quot;Texas  Angel&quot; stands on its own, but to truely grasp the entire story, read  &quot;Texas Angel&quot; first. It is the story of a deeply spiritual quest  which is obviously the result of years of prayers by others when Micah, the  main character, gives up on himself.  It is violent, but the  violence  shows the depth of despair some must reach to find God. It also shows the  contrast of God's love... a love that cannot be accepted by Micah, the main  character.

This wonderful series follows the life of Abbie, an independant woman of her time, and those she loves. The series shows her maturing as a person and a Christian. In &quot;Honor's Reward&quot;, she must shed her  idealistic self to face the realities of life, just as most women must. The  process is often painful, but also has it's own rewards. One of the  conversions to Christianity seemed a bit unrealistic to me, but like Abbie,  I must learn that things don't always follow my way of thinking. God ways  are higher than mine. I don't understand how Abbie continues to keep  infomation from Elliot concerning his father. I feel so close to these  characters that I miss Monte.

I must admit during one of the earlier volumes, I had to put it down as I could not handle any more losses by Abbie. What I realized was that when I cannot put the trials of life  away, the Lord as ever faithful, just as He is to the characters in the  Rocky Mountain series. Kristen has a remarkable talent for writing. Thanks,  Kristen, for sharing your gift with us!	1999-12-03

Great examples of working through spiritually abusive situations. However, it is realistic that the abused don't readily recognize the abuse until they seek God and look for His fruits. Also, realistic example of &quot;it  rains on the good and the bad&quot;	1999-08-14

They can be read and enjoyed more than once. However, one story about an &quot;intense&quot; man is an example of how Christian women can be abused  in the name of the Lord. Tread carefully with this story. Otherwise, I love  Lori Wick's stories.	1999-03-27

I bought a soft cover based soley on my love for the author's writings. Since reading it, I have ordered it in hardback. My 11 year old daughter and I read Lori Wick's books together, but I told her to  save this one for when she could truely appreciate it.<br />This book  encourages us that faithfulnes and patience are rewarded by God. We all  deserve an escape from total reality once in a while. <br />I felt the heart  of a true &quot;princess&quot; in a world that gives great credence to  worldly, self-centered royalty.	1999-03-27
