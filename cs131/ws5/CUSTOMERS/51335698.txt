Set in the middle ages somewhere (probably near Constantinople??), this is an adventure/romance with a super hero and absolutely great heroine.  The plot involves the struggle of Lady Syrah to regain her family lands and title for her younger brother.  In order to get the necesary funds to hire mercenaries for the job, she kidnaps Crown Prince Jibril of the realm (with whom she has secretly been in love with since meeting him when she was 13) and holds him for ransom. An so the fun begins...<BR>This is a great novel, with fully-realized supporting characters, including Syrah's 14-year-old brother Eben (who spins hilarious detailed tall tales), wily and wise King Ahriman, an African \\"mercenary\\" Zebengo, and a lady's maid who has hysterical sexual fantasies at every moment.<BR>But the star of this book is Syrah...who play's an expert game of chess...I won't say more - JUST READ THE BOOK!!	2003-08-10

I just found the entire book believable and funny and touching.  Sophie is Julian Dane's youngest sister, who got a divorce after a horrible abusive marriage.  This is the story of her evolution as a person and as a woman, and who better to be her mate than another \\"lost soul\\", Caleb.  This is a romance novel, yes, but also one about personal growth and redemption.<br />I have to admit to being a bit hardened and cynical, but the last paragraph was so sweet that I cried.  It made me want to raise a glass of champagne to Sophie and Caleb, \\"May you meet forever at your pond!\\"	2002-05-20

Her heroes are alpha-male without being stupid, and her heroines are intelligent and vulnerable without being insipid.  Dragon and Rycca are a truly engaging couple, and the plot never drags, as they get to know each other and learn to love and respect their arranged-marriage spouse.<br />I recommend the entire Norse/Saxon trilogy by Litton to all who love medieval romances.  The books capture the brutality of the period, while focusing on noble men and women who are trying to bring peace to their war-torn people.  The theme in all of the three books include &quot;gifted&quot; women, strong warrior men, and the rewards for good hearts and intentions.<br />They all get a five-star rating from me.	2002-04-07

For all you Garfield fans who have been left hungering for the author to return to the historical genre, try Josie Litton.  And check out her Viking-Saxon trilogy.

I have loved Adele Ashworth's previous books, and looked forward to this one.  The characters were unsympathetic and I guessed the ending by Chapter Two.

It's apparent from the first few pages that this a retelling of the Cinderella story, and at first I thought 'how cute.&quot;  But this book is classic Julia Quinn, with a strong, sexy hero capable of love (don't you get tired of men who are so incomplete they &quot;can't&quot; know true love?), and an intelligent heroine who knows herself and has the strength of character to follow her principals.<br />Mix in the wonderful Bridgerton family and Ms. Quinn's famous humor, and you have a &quot;stay-up-all-night-to-finish&quot;  romance of endearing charm.	2001-07-04

Just when the dramatic tension get too intense, Ms. Fields makes the reader laugh as well.  It was nice to see the heroine plagued by inner demons this time, instead of the usual angst-filled hero.  But Jezebel is a great character and who could ever resist Rafe.  This is a great feel-good novel by an exciting new talent. Check out &quot;The Maiden's Revenge&quot; as well.  I can't wait for Hillary Field's next book.	2000-11-07

I have read all of Ms. Ranney's books and this is the best by far.  Margaret, a woman widowed by a violent fire, seeks to enrich her meager living by selling a rare book of erotic to a titled gentleman.  In the process, she meets a stranger - a lonely man who believes he must mary an heiress to save his family's fortune.<br />The characters are well drawn - even the secondary ones.  The main characters are both lovable and real.  There is a sense of sweet sexuality that pervades the book, even while the hero and heroine are getting to know each other and overcoming the problems in their relationship.<br />If you are a fan of Christina Dodd, Stephanie Laurens or Julia Quinn, I highly recommend this book.  It is a sweet and satisfying read.	2000-10-15
US	51335698	RMZZIEA8HTQB2	0312974132	769451414	A Little Scandal	Books	5	39	41	N	N	Sweet and sexy	After reading a couple of early reviews of this book on Amazon, I almost didn't order it.  I'm so glad I had faith enough in Patricia Cabot's writing to go ahead and read it, because it is a charming love story about  two souls ravaged by society's gossip. Kate's family was destroyed by  scandal, leaving her alone and penniless and forced to make her living as a  governess and chaperone.  Burke, the Marquis of Wingate, has also been  living as an outcast from the 'polite world', but has rejoined it in order  to find a husband for his daughter.  Though this story could have been dark  and depressing, the characters have such humor and individuality, that it  is a charming tale throughout.  Watching Kate discover her sexuality and  Burke trying to overcome his temper is very funny and poignant.  <br />The  plot is tightly written, although the mystery is somewhat easy to figure  out.  The charm of the book is not only in the dialog, but also in being  privy to the character's thoughts.  I found Burke an especially endearing  hero, who is constantly trying to keep himself from smashing something in  anger and is human enough to feel vain about his approaching middle age.   Kate is intelligent and courageous in spite of her vulnerability in the  face of her past.  The love scenes are tender and well written.<br />This book  is a keeper, and I look forward to Ms. Cabot's next book.  I have read all  her novels to date, and I think this one is her best yet.	2000-06-14

After Richard and Catriona marry because of the stipulations  of a will, they struggle to create a relationship that will satisfy both  her responsibilities and his need to be needed.  Using the theme of a  &quot;hero without a cause&quot;, this book is more thoughtful than some of  Stephanie Laurens' other novels.  It's a satisfying very satifying, gentle  book to read on a rainy day.	2000-05-28
US	51335698	RVSI8WMP7VH5F	0440221986	78629434	A Dangerous Man	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Very satisfying	With &quot;A Dangerous Man&quot;, Connie Brockway has created a tortured hero with an actual reason to be tortured and an intelligent, strong and compassionate heroine.  I loved watching the attraction between Hart and  Mercy develop and seeing them overcome not only their own doubts, but the  censure of the English elite.  Hart's conflicts with his own needs and his  honorable compassion creates just the right tension to justify his actions.   The underlying sense of intrigue and danger also helps to spice up the  plot.  If you love &quot;McClairen's Isle - The Passionate One&quot;, I  think you will also enjoy this very satisfying book and it's two  unconventional lead characters.	2000-05-28

After reading the other reviews at Amazon, I guess this is one of the books you either love or hate, so let me put my vote on loving it. Having two extraordinary  characters put in a pressure-cooker of danger and suspense just made the  love story all the more poignant and urgent.  I just couldn't put it down  the first time I read it, and I always pick it up every several months to  re-read.  I would love to read more about some of the secondary characters  involved in the book.  My recommendation is to give this book a try,  especially if you like mystery and action mixed with your romance.	2000-05-27

The storyline is interesting and original: a young woman masquerading as the mistress of one of the ton's most notorious earls, whom she believes to be dead (he's  not!), because of a blackmail scheme.  The real charm of the book, however,  is in the funny and poignant developing relationship between Iphiginia and  Marcus:  the first romantic interlude between the two is one of the  funniest passages I've ever read.  Iphiginia's courage and energy leap off  the page to make her a very endearing heroine, and Marcus - as a farmer  turned earl - is both sexy and vulnerable.  Though some of the improbable  plot twists could have been left out, this book is still very much worth  reading after a long, frustrating day at work (or with the kids).	2000-05-26

The hero, Grant - a Bow Street runner - is strong and sexy without being so boneheaded that he  resists love until the end of the book.  The heroine, whom we know as  Vivien, is poignant in her search to regain her memory while falling in  love with the man who seems to protect her.  The story is well-plotted, and  has enough unpredictable twists to keep you turning page after page.  The  love scenes are steamy and compelling, and the ending is sweet.  I really  loved this book and highly recommend it.	2000-05-26

Ms. Kingsley is a very gifted writer, and her expertise in writing prose and her talent for fleshing out  secondary characters are the reasons to buy this book;  I have rated all  her other novels with five stars.  Though this book has an interesting and  imaginative premise, the heroine is irritatingly stubborn and the hero is  just a little too saintly to be compelling.  Ms. Kingsley's use of  spiritual themes in her past books were sweet and secondary to the plot and  characterizations.  This book seems to be more about angels than about the  relationship of the characters or the difficulties facing them.  Although  Katherine Kingsley is still a first-rate author, buy this book only if you  have nothing better to do on a rainy day.	2000-05-26

Both her earlier novels are definitely worth reading.  The characters  involved in them will be familiar to readers who have read  &quot;Minx&quot;.  Emily is a terrific American heroine: intelligent,  spirited, independent and witty.  Alex is less vividly portrayed, but -  although his violent mood swings are a little hard to understand - he  finally shows enough love, loyalty and strength to satisfy the reader that  he is worth Emily's love. Tender and poignant at times and hilarious in  others, &quot;Splendid&quot; is a great romance and a must-read for lovers  of the genre.	2000-05-26

Though the plot is a little contrived, the charm of the two leads and their attraction for each  other make it definitely worth reading.  Jordan is very sexy and appealing,  and his character has enough flaws to provide the necessary frustrations to  the reader.  When he finally unravels the mystery surrounding Emily and  realizes his mistakes, his attack of conscience is very rewarding.  Emily  is a doll!  Her conflicts between her feelings for Jordan and the dangerous  situation she finds herself in seem real and compelling.  The villain is  confronted and defeated is a very satisfying scene.  Good secondary  characters lend depth and humor to the book.  Thanks Ms. Jeffries for a  very good read.	2000-05-26

Can this be the author who wrote &quot;A Year and a Day&quot;?  The hero is quite sexy and the historical detail is very good, but the heroine is such a brat that I  couldn't believe the hero still wanted her no matter how beautiful she was.   The girl simply didn't deserve her man or the print it took up to write  about her.  She is a spoiled child who never really grows up.  Although I  abhor abuse in novels, I was rooting for someone to knock her senseless by  the middle of the book.  Ms. Henley is known for her characters who are  buffeted by the historical events that involve them, but I just couldn't  care what happens to this couple.	2000-05-26

I just re-read &quot;The Golden Barbarian&quot; and remembered how endearing this book really is.  It's one of my favorite books by Iris Johansen.  The setting was fascinating, and the plot never bogged down.   The lead characters, Tess and Galen, began the book as sympathetic and  likeable and ended the book as loveable people with depth and richness of  emotional response.  Galen is a sexy hero who actually does heroic things  (imagine that)!  Tess is intelligent, strong and never petty.  The utter  lack of stupidity exhibited by the couple is such a refreshing change from  so many romances.  The secondary characters are well-drawn, and I'd love to  see a sequel concerning Tess's cousin who will play a pivotal role in  Tamrovia in the future.  <br />A very good book from an excellent author.	2000-05-26

Gideon is a brooding hero, but for once the reader can understand his pain because of his past.  He's not forbidding for no reason, which is often the case with  reluctant heroes.  Harriet is just a delight, with her love for fossils and  common-sense approach to life.  The passion that ignites between them seems  very urgent and very real.  While this is basically a  &quot;redemption&quot; novel, there is enough charm and humor throughout to  keep it from becoming cloyingly sweet.  The unexpected twists and turns in  the plot serve up some danger and suspense, but the true joy in this book  is the friendship and love that develops between the couple.  I loved the  depth of Gideon's sensitivity and perception beneath his fierce exterior.   This is truly a &quot;must-read&quot; for regency fans.	2000-05-25

I loved Elizabeth and Geoffrey, and their troubles and eccentricities seemed very  believable to me.  Elizabeth is courageous and her faults are  understandable considering her youth and tragic past. Geoffrey's  &quot;rules&quot; and stiffness come across as endearing because he is  basically such a strong, honorable and loving hero.  The secondary  characters have depth and personality.  Add to this mix an ending that is  sweet and funny, and you have a great &quot;light read&quot; - a book that  is engaging and emotionally comforting.	2000-05-25

Victoria and Robert, separated seven years ago by treachery and misunderstanding, meet again in much altered circumstances.  Robert, the  guiltier of the two in their past, suffers enough after he realizes his  mistakes to satsify any reader.  These are two very loveable characters,  and watching them regain their love over the course of the book is simply  magic.  My only wish is that the sensuality would be have been a little  hotter, but the lack doesn't detract from this funny and moving love story  about two people destined for each other.  Definitely a comfort read.	2000-05-25

Both the hero and heroine as likeable and believable. The only reason I did not rate it with five stars is the less-than-strong plot, a supposed &quot;murder  mystery&quot; with a somewhat muddled solution.  &quot;Indiscretion&quot;  is definately worth a read, though, if for nothing else than Ms. Hunter's  fine dialogue and her great comedic situations.	2000-05-25

The love story is great, the sensuality is charmingly warm, and the various characters just seem to come alive on the page.  The humor  which constantly arises due the the contrasting cultures made me laugh all  through the book.  Christina and Lyon are both intelligent, likeable and  strong.  The lurking sense of danger which threads through the book makes  the plot satisfying, and Christina's mother's journal entries (which start  each chapter) are very poignant.  I just love this book and would encourage  anyone who loves the Regency genre to read it.	2000-05-25

Though the premise is based on &quot;The Misunderstanding&quot;, the book is not trite or boring.  The book includes  all that is necessary for me in a romance: in-depth characterizations,  superb dialogue, a little danger and a lot of action, and a hero and  heroine to love and cheer for.  The only weak part of the book for me was  the mysticism thrown in, but it doesn't really detract from the romance  between two strong and very individual characters.  If you like Julia  Quinn, Stephanie Laurens, the early Amanda Quick, or Jillian Hunter, you  will love this book.	2000-05-25

The first few pages show all of Ms. Dodd's usual charm up to the point where the &quot;hero&quot; enters the  story.  Unfortunately, the &quot;hero&quot; shows all the emotional  intelligence of a spoiled two-year-old;  apparently his stunted responses  are caused by his father's death when he was an youth.  Not only is he  insensitive to the heroine's character, he is so self-involved that he  can't discern anyone elses feelings, even his mother's or his children's.   The heroine is great - I just wish she could have ended up with someone who  was worth her.  I love Christina Dodd and will continue to buy her books,  since no author can get it all right all of the time, but this one is  barely worth the price.	2000-05-25

I made the mistake of buying the hardcover  edition of this book, but I will not make that mistake with Ms. Quick  again.  The earlier novels, although formulaic, were filled with great  eccentric characters and satisfying plots.  This book is not even worth  checking out from the library.
