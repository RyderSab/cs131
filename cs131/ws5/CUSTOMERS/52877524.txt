Unlike other anthologies of gay male fiction, In Another Part of the Forest features work by men and women, gay and straight.  English and American fiction dominate but there are also selections by Canadian and Australian writers, and a handful of translated works (from Spanish, French, Japanese, Russian, and Yiddish).  The effect is a multi-dimensional book that has true moral value.  Modern gay identity can only be understood as kaleidoscopic, always shifting, never reduceable to a single ghettoized form.  Yet most gay male short fiction anthologies offer up stories exclusively from the perspective of the gay male author.  By illuminating the gay experience not only from within but also from the perspective of the outside observer, Manguel and Stephenson seem to be suggesting that to be gay is also to be part of the wider sphere of being human.  So alongside works by the closeted E. M. Forster and the very uncloseted Edmund White, we also have superb selections by Sherwood Anderson and Alice Munro and  Issac Bashevis Singer.  Another highlight is a lusciously sexy (of course) piece by D. H. Lawrence.  The editors also include works from the sci-fi realm, as well as one great crime thriller piece (Marco Denevi's \\"Michel.\\")  Perhaps the main link between these works is that they are all examples of excellent writing.  Most important, however, is the profoundly ethical dimension to this book, in which all the gay men featured do not come off as heroes or victims (some are downright cads), an editorial choice that means to embrace the entire human community, including gays, as equally flawed, and equally deserving of respect and the right to happiness.  For myself, \\"Contact,\\" by John Lonie, an author I was not familiar with, stands out as the most exhilarating story in the book.  In it the author illustrates the poignant challenge and the urgent necessity of Forster's mantra: Only connect.  Connecting with people unlike oneself seems to be the most difficult thing there is, yet it is fundamental to our survival.  And, as this anthology of glorious writing reminds us, once we connect we may discover that we are not so different from each other after all.	2004-06-28

And for many gay men, there is no figure more \\"other\\" than one's own father.  Yet, as the title suggests, coming to terms with one's father is also a way to truly see oneself.  The best essays in the book (notably those of Joseph Hansen and Bernard Cooper) are superbly written evocations of the knot of father-son love, scary and deep with feeling.	2003-09-30

Author Will Fellows spoke to rural gay Midwestern men of all ages, to draw out, record and give shape to their life stories. The result is a poignant and revealing mosaic-portrait that shows the rich intersections of farm life, gay culture and the American twentieth century. Of especial interest to me were the stories of those men born nearly a century ago - we have so little written testimony of what it was like to live as a gay man \\"back then.\\" And while the subject is gay men, I imagine this book would also be of interest to any reader wanting to know more about rural lives and attitudes in twentieth-century America.

My relation with cars has long been superficial: the key, the radio dial, the window, the seat belt.  Jackson's humorous and knowledgeable book gives us non-mechanical types a look under the hood.

This engaging book shows how Chalone wines, some of the best in the world, came to be.  It is essentially a history of the company and of the people who made it happen.  What emerges from this fast-moving tale is the constant determination and vision required for any successful enterprise.  I do wish the authors had spent a little more time discussing the wines themselves; we are told that a given year is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; without any sense of what that might mean in the glass.  But this is a small quibble.  All those interested in wine, California history, or the inner workings of a growing company (the discussions of which are unusually frank) should read this book, which was written to support Chalone's very worthwhile foundation.	2002-10-30

This beautifully-written, handsomely-illustrated book is a must-read for all lovers of art, of any period.  Not only does Varnedoe illuminate the works of specific artists, traditions and eras, he proposes fresh ways of looking at and thinking about art.  Writing about Degas, he says, &quot;This Realism doesn't describe a world, it proposes one.&quot;  Modern art makes the familiar look strange so that we may come to know it more fully - from a variety of perspectives.  Key to Varnedoe's argument is the contribution of the individual artist, whose innovations should not be reduced to a &quot;cultural context&quot; by later historians.  My favorite quote in the book comes not from Varnedoe but from the Russian Formalist Viktor Shklovski: &quot;And ... so that stones may be stony, there exists what we call art.&quot;  A provocative and inspiring read.	2002-10-29

Months after reading \\"Woman in Rome,\\" it is the voice of Adriana, the woman of the title, that lingers in my memory.  By telling in the 1st person his story of a young woman whose beauty, poverty, passivity and kindness lead her to prostitution and abandonment, the author shows us how such a fall from hope and grace is a gradual, imperceptible process, one day after the next.  Moravia writes in a deceptively simple style that keeps the reader close to his heroine's actions, so that her losses become our own.  Near the end of the novel there is an astonishing paragraph, in which the narrator imagines herself drowning.  This heartbreaking paragraph encapsulates the downward pull of the entire book, the longing for oblivion in the face of lost dreams.  It is too long to quote in full, but here are some excerpts.  (Note, too, the beautiful translation.)<br />\\"I obeyed and he undressed in the dark and got into bed beside me.  I turned toward him to embrace him, but he pushed me away wordlessly and curled himself up on the edge of the bed with his back to me.  This gesture filled me with bitterness and I, too, hunched myself up, waiting for sleep with a widowed spirit.  But I began to think about the sea again and was overcome by the longing to drown myself.  I imagined it would only be a moment's suffering, and then my lifeless body would float from wave to wave beneath the sky for ages. [...]  At last I would sink to the bottom, would be dragged head downward toward some icy blue current that would carry me along the sea for months and years among submarine rocks, fish, and seaweed, and floods of limpid seawater would wash my forehead, my breast, my belly, my legs, slowly wearing away my flesh, smoothing and refining me continually.  And at last some wave, someday, would cast me up on some beach, nothing but a handful of fragile, white bones [...] a little heap of bones, without human shape, among the clean stones of a shore.\\"bones [...] a little heap of bones, without human shape, among the clean stones of a shore.\\"	2002-10-28

Kluger weaves together recollections of her childhood on an Indiana farm in the 1930s with the recipes for the dishes she grew up eating.

The unusual kaleidoscopic narrative structure of the book led me to take my time with it.  Because one is constantly shifting in time and point of view, it can feel that, as a &quot;story,&quot; the book never gets off the ground.  On the other hand, this stylistic choice encouraged me to savor each page as I might in a book of poems.  (Also, the language is extremely well-crafted, as in poetry.)  Here is a quote that, for me, encapsulated not only Scott's subject but her own way of putting the novel together: &quot;Symmetry and perspective, chiaroscuro, balance--all these, Egon Schiele believes, offer false comfort, and man is truly aware only when he learns to accept, even to delight in the incongruous, terrifying nature of the visual world.&quot;	2002-05-08

This coming-of-age tale wrapped me around its little finger on Page One and did not let go until the very end, which came much too quickly.  I bought it at an airport bookstore and read most of it during a short flight, finishing it (instead of unpacking) when I got home.  Schaeffer has drop-dead perfect pitch for the rhythms of family life, which he captures in warm, compassionate, and seamless storytelling prose.  I especially appreciated the way he blends family humor and pain (even abuse) into a uniquely personal yet totally universal mood of adolescent yearning.  This book is poignant and incredibly funny (my frequent guffaws had people turning heads on the plane) and I would recommend it to anyone who loves to get pulled into a book you can't put down until you're done.	2001-11-26

I had never even heard of John Fante until I read about him in a book about Los Angeles literature.  His (alter ego) character Arturo Bandini may come across as a narcissistic fool, but who cares when his story is conveyed in such achingly gorgeous--yet never wordy--prose?  Fante evokes his character's surroundings with a lyrical concision that is admirable--and in a couple places nothing short of heart-stopping.  &quot;Then she was gone, and I sat with my teeth gritted, looking at a room like ten million California rooms, a bit of wood here and a bit of rag there, the furniture, with cobwebs in the ceiling and dust in the corners, her room, and everybody's room, Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Diego, a few boards of plaster and stucco to keep the sun out.&quot;  And: &quot;My feet were cut when I put on my shoes and walked out of that apartment and into the bright astonishment of the night.&quot;	2001-10-18

Reidinger has an intelligent prose style that can deftly evoke a place or a mood.  Here is a wonderfully tight paragraph: &quot;They drifted out of the park, up an adjoining street.  Televisions flashed dimly in the bay windows of refurbished Victorian homes, doing the important work of holding the republic together.  Guy had no idea where they were going, but Doug plainly did.&quot;  Unfortunately, this conciseness is often lost amidst passages of overwriting (there are far too many clauses that begin &quot;as if...&quot;) and precious language (one paragraph contains the following words: beckoning, perusing, trills, casement, and bestir).  The same goes for the plot: on the one hand there is a genuinely compelling narrative about two men, one young, one older, who are wary about intimacy.  Yet their story gets lost amidst endless narrative side-trips, flashbacks, and character sketches that do nothing to advance the story.  In the end the main characters lack depth, and the final pages fizzle out.  Still, Reidinger captures many aspects of contemporary life in San Francisco, and I was compelled enough by his affecting, sometimes sexy story to read on to the end.	2001-10-10

I was dazzled by the exhibit in San Francisco, but now I'm especially glad to have the accompanying book.  I rarely find it worthwhile to purchase museum exhibit catalogues, but what I love about &quot;Stranger Passing&quot; is that I can ponder a given image as long as I like, &quot;reading and re-reading&quot; it as I would a really good short story.  Indeed, many of these portraits seem as laden with interpretive possibilities as a story by Chekhov or Alice Munro or T. C. Boyle.  From a grizzled woman selling papers in the middle of a Colorado boulevard, to a solitary New York banker having dinner, his aloneness matched by a single tulip in front of his little bistro table: I found myself deeply moved by the lavish yet subtle artistry Sternfeld has bestowed on these people and places--each one unique yet somehow familiar--that he encountered in this strange and wonderful country of ours.	2001-09-27

It is well-written and features compelling characters and settings, yet it never really gels as a sustained narrative. I wonder if the title was a good idea. &quot;The World's Room&quot; refers to a second-hand shop the narrator's neurotic mother is forever hoping to open, in which to display all the tchotchkes and foreign junk she has amassed during their life on the road. As a metaphor for his first book, however, I fear that, like the narrator's mother with her shop, London has tried to stuff too much disparate material into the world of his novel. The first (and better) half of the book seems to be about the narrator's complex relationship to his older brother. But after the older brother commits suicide (an event we learn of in the novel's opening sentence), the narrative begins to slacken, and the novel reads more like someone's private journals modified lightly into fiction. Still, London has a strong prose style, and I look forward to reading his next book.	2001-09-24

It reminded me that serving one's country can take many forms.  Whitman had little use for Christian pieties or military rigidity, neither of which offered much comfort to the thousands of wounded and dying young soldiers the great poet visited at their bedside.  What he did offer them was the gift of human connection, kindness, and respect, qualities too often lacking in our American society, then and now.  My one complaint is that Morris often quotes from Whitman's poems without always giving the title of the poem in question.  One would love to be able to turn from Morris to Leaves of Grass and read a given poem in its entirety, but if one doesn't have the exact edition from 1973 he used then one is out of luck.  This is a small criticism, however, and I am deeply grateful to the author for having written such an important, inspiring book.	2001-01-04

Intrigued, I purchased &quot;The Long Home,&quot; and I can say that I was not disappointed.  While all the poems are not of equal strength, I've always felt that poets should be judged by their best work, and at least one poem, the sonnet &quot;Revenant,&quot; is a masterpiece.  In that work, more than in the longer title poem, Wiman shows his gifts as a rigorous thinker: &quot;her white face under the unburdening skies / upturned to feel the burn that never came: / that furious insight and the end of pain.&quot;  The shape of this poem, on every level, engages the tightly-coiled subject of a woman's singular obsession.  I've read this poem many times and as with all great poems each time I discover something new.  But the long poem of the book's title, while often moving and evocative of a particular time and place, seems to me to be too loose, occasionally approaching an arbitrarily clipped prose piece.  (Wiman has, to my ear, a disagreeable habit of beginning lines with &quot;Of,&quot; as in &quot;without a speck / Of paving,&quot; &quot;a level cloud / Of cotton,&quot; &quot;a single lock / Of cotton...&quot; and so forth.  There are several similar examples on nearly every page of the poem.)  Despite these reservations, overall this is an excellent volume and I will be eager to read Wiman's next book, and curious to see in what direction his work evolves.	2000-10-20

Unhappy families can be the stuff of great literature but nothing  in the telling here gives the book wings; humdrum, often cruelly-rendered  details collect on every page, leaden and inert.

In addition to being an astonishingly well-crafted portrait of society, of marriage, of individual dreams and disappointments, I  believe that Eliot wrote Middlemarch as a mirror for the reader to examine  his or her own life--somewhere in this vast novel, if we are honest, we can  all find someone like ourselves--and to realize that each choice we make,  each of our relationships, provides us with the opportunity to affect the  lives of those around us in either positive or negative ways.  So often  readers hold books at arms' length; it is easy to pass judgment on others,  whether on characters in a book, or on our neighbors.  Few books combine  brilliant story-telling with profound moral value.  Middlemarch is one such  book.  Do not hesitate to read it!	2000-03-18

Vandenburgh writes knowingly of the Golden State with a cranky, tender familiarity.  She is equally deft at  dissecting all the shifts and shimmerings that combine to make up a single  human emotion.  Her novel is constructed not chronologically, yet it's not  circular either, perhaps angular.  She takes seriously the book's  underlying metaphor of physics--that the world is both chartable and  predictable yet profoundly chaotic and unknowable--and this metaphor is  woven into the lives of her two main characters, Alec, an architect married  with two children, and Anna, a soon-to-be divorced poet with one child.   The chapters alternate temporal perspectives and points of view, and there  is in this structure a certain hopefulness, as if one could come to a weary  situation with renewed freshness.  (The ending illustrates this best.)  At  times Vandenburgh's characters seem to be masks or puppets standing in for  disturbing archetypes of Man and Woman.  Alec is forever  &quot;lumbering&quot; or &quot;striding&quot; while Anna is  &quot;vanishing,&quot; &quot;vague,&quot; &quot;hesitating.&quot;  &quot;A  woman acted inward,&quot; Vandenburgh writes, &quot;taking whatever blows  there were into the softness of her body, while a man might more easily go  out and commit his hate upon the world.&quot;  The book registers a kind of  perpetual astonishment that men and women are different.  How much more  generously strong this fine novel would have been had it explored not  fractious difference but the essential humanity of men and women, their  common and fundamental fragility and worth.  But the author keeps  skin-close to her subjects, what she calls, distinguishing between the two,  &quot;the interior and the real world.&quot;  (This brings to mind a  stylistic quibble: it seems that on nearly every page Vandenburgh uses the  word &quot;actual&quot; or &quot;actually,&quot; as if to emphasize some  distinction between the fictional and non-fictional aspects of our lives.   I found this tic increasingly annoying.)  This scrutiny yields some real  gems.  An early chapter entitled &quot;Bodies At Rest,&quot; which  juxtaposes to great effect Alec's heartbreak over a parent's death and the  seismic breaking of a California earthquake, is one of the most moving  pieces of writing I have read in a very long time.  In the end, though, it  is paradoxically a secondary character, Gina (Alec's wife), who turns out  to be the most appealing and interesting person in the novel: someone who  indeed has a reason to feel broken and yet forges on, believing  passionately in her commitment to both Family and Art.  I look forward to  reading this author's next novel (please, though, no more ungainly words  like &quot;haptic,&quot; &quot;cathected,&quot; or &quot;eidetic&quot;);  this kind of writing offers rare vision into the deepest of our painfully  human subtleties.	1999-07-25
US	52877524	R3HXOGG1SMOHP1	0670883565	555286470	The Spell	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Both intimate and operatic	Hollinghurst's third novel is very much like an eighteenth-century play or opera (think &quot;Marriage of Figaro&quot; or, more recently, Sondheim's &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;) in which social mores are explored and  exposed through the follies of a tight band of entwined (so to speak)  characters.  Like in a play, each of the four men here is given his moment  in the sun, which has the wonderful effect of giving us insight into  characters both sympathetic (Alex) and despicable (Justin), all of whom are  revealed to have just as much humanity as all the rest of us flawed humans.   Also as with a play, the &quot;stage&quot; of the novel is quite  circumscribed: principally, gay London and Robin's country house, where a  big summer party is the novel's central scene.  Hollinghurst is a master  craftsman when it comes to language; his first novel, &quot;The Swimming  Pool Library,&quot; was a historical tour de force, while his second,  &quot;The Folding Star,&quot; featured great scenes and compelling  characters but failed to hold together, ending much too abruptly after  considerable meandering.  &quot;The Spell&quot; on the other hand is  tightly constructed, a spellbinding read that I couldn't put down.   Hollinghurst has taken the stale genre of the comedy of manners and created  something utterly fresh and wonderful.	1999-07-23
US	52877524	RGT5IL8VYP9SZ	0684849364	585397299	California Screaming: A Novel	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Surprisingly wonderful	A friend loaned me &quot;California Screaming&quot; with the comment that it was perfect &quot;summer trash&quot; reading, so I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it's actually quite wonderful, well-written,  carefully crafted, and utterly accurate.  The book reminds me a lot of  Balzac's &quot;Lost Illusions&quot; in which a young, beautiful, dewy-eyed  would-be poet is seduced by the big city, taken in by an older rake, but  then... well, I don't want to spoil the ending; suffice it to say that  these relationships existed in Paris in the 1830s just as they do today in  Los Angeles.  Guinan's worldview is of course less tragic than Balzac's and  I was pleased to see the characters achieve some &quot;growth&quot; as the  novel achieves &quot;closure&quot; (pardon the LA-speak).  A wonderful  novel that will have you reading late into the night.	1999-07-03
US	52877524	RVCU7K493WYJG	0452270375	228093464	Heartlands: A Gay Man's Odyssey Across America	Books	3	1	4	N	N	Too long, overwritten, but important	Yates Rist has taken the classic American genre of the literary road trip and transformed it into an intimate portrait of the true diversity that describes the American &quot;gay community&quot; of men.  The author is on  a deeply felt quest to locate what connects one gay man to another.  If he  never finds his own personal grail--for, as he learns, we are all  individuals, and &quot;community&quot; is determined by many, many  factors--he does offer the reader an abundance of well-observed depictions  of gay men far outside the now-traditional gay male urban world.  While  &quot;Heartlands&quot; is an important sociological text and an often  moving memoir, its length and writing style indicate a lack of rigorous  editing.  Yates Rist writes quite lyrically, and his descriptions of the  natural beauty of this country are often inspiring, but all too frequently  there is page after page of needless mush.  And there are so many men, so  many descriptions of gay cowboys and Bayou boys and Eskimos and  Southwestern psychics, that the overall effect is a kind of numbness.  The  book itself becomes promiscuous in its presentation of men: each seems  interesting at the time but after awhile they all blur together, leaving  the reader with the overall impression of an overlong, somewhat flabby  book.  This is a shame, for its message of respecting and encouraging true  diversity rather than prepackaged, niche-marketed identity-boxes is more  necessary today than ever.	1999-06-28
US	52877524	R19UNI4SVRNYF5	014027281X	800025990	In the Memory of the Forest	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	History, memory, identity	Superbly written, _In the Memory of the Forest_ is a powerfully haunting exploration of the dangerous consequences of suppressing painful memories, both individual and collective.  I especially appreciated how Powers takes  time to build his story carefully.  The novel takes on the deliberate pace  of history itself: each character is convincingly layered, just as the  identity of a village, or a person, or a family, is also constructed over  time, an accretion of interwoven layers of secrets, fears, loves, evils.  A  richly engrossing work that deserves to be widely read and discussed.	1999-04-07
US	52877524	R3MVW772YH093B	0385486804	674569455	Into the Wild	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Necessary reading	There are nearly 200 reviews below for this well-written, gripping, emotionally compelling little book, so I have little to add, other than to ask a question: what is it about Chris McCandless that seems to inspire  such kind empathy in some and such forceful hatred in others?  What buttons  in the American psyche has this young man's short life--and Krakauer's  brilliant telling of it--pushed?	1999-02-15
US	52877524	R1PXH5BQVW0MHU	0805055363	831702737	The Profile Makers: Poems	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Magnificent	This is a first-rate collection.  Bierds explores questions of image, frame and contour in poems which trace, in a sense, a modern history of representation.  A glorious example is her &quot;The Breaking-Aways,&quot;  an elegant poem which begins with Samuel Morse's astonished reaction to his  own invention and which ends with his rhythmic remembrance of a childhood  encounter with a mysterious sound in the forest, when he &quot;made from  that / scream, from that wondrous outrush, / something apart from  wonder.&quot;  Very highly recommended.	1999-01-18
US	52877524	R31U3V586NW8FG	0684822776	514615417	The Riders	Books	3	4	4	N	N	A compelling, emotional read	This book, while not perfect, definitely holds the reader's attention from beginning to end.  The main character, Scully, is a modern-day Quasimodo, a misfit in a world of masks and deception, someone who has but sheer will  and a good heart--and a savagely loving daughter--to go on.  His quest to  find his wife who has apparently abandoned her husband and daughter is a  dramatic, at times breathless, depiction of what it's like to realize one  knows little about those one thought one knew the most.  The writing  occasionally annoyed me (too self-conscious at times for my taste) but I  was willing to let it slide, so harrowing did I find Scully's journey.  And  as much as I adore Paris, having lived there a year I must, hlas, attest  to the accuracy of his less-then flattering portrait of the City of Light.	1998-12-08
