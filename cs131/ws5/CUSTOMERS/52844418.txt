Eric Prentis has written The Astute Investor  for people who want to take responsibility for their own investment success.  To be astute in any field requires hard work, study, and reflection.  The book contains no magic bullets or supposedly sure -fire techniques.  Rather, it presents a good introduction to the most important investing topics.  Moreover, it also contains much advice on how to discipline one's mind and emotions in order to make wise financial decisions, as well as a thorough section on retirement planning.<br /><br />Prentis offers three sorts of information in this book.  The first sort, what I call \\"preparing the ground,\\" explains the context in which stock and bond market movements occur.  For instance, he explains how the federal government controls the monetary supply, how to understand economic indicators, how the business cycle works, and how interest rates affect the business cycle, among many other fundamental topics.  Investing without understanding these topics cannot be more than a hit or miss enterprise.  Reading through this material might be daunting for beginners, but the author explains it clearly and as painlessly as possible.<br /><br />The second type of information has to do with how to buy stocks and bonds once you understand the context of the market-you could consider this the \\"techniques\\" portion of the book.  Prentis is very much a fundamentalist-that is, he presents several methods of choosing companies to invest in based on studying their financial health, future possibilities, and style of management.  However, he doesn't neglect technical analsis, and explains some elementary chart reading techniques, including a good basic discussion of candlesticks.  He also discusses how to integrate chart reading with fundamental analysis.<br /><br />Aside from fundamental and technical analysis,  an important part of Prentis' strategy entails placing a large portion of one's portfolio in the S&P 500 Index, and he has some very persuasive arguments to support this.  For bonds, he describes the types of bonds, their risks, and at what point in the business cycle bonds are most profitable to buy.<br /><br />The third type of information involves trading psychology as well as the qualities of mind necessary to carry out investing in a rational manner.  He emphasizes that good investors tend to be lifelong learners. He also devotes an entire chapter to the contrarian mindset-that is, thinking for oneself and avoiding the herd mentality.  This is important material, as the best investors are independent-minded people who learn to manage their emotions and to work out their own way of understanding the markets.<br /><br />The Astute Investor  is an excellent guide for both beginning and more advanced investors.  The information on economics and investing techniques is thorough and provides a solid foundation for further study.  Learning to invest is a lifelong journey-there is always more to learn about the markets and about oneself.

After having lived for years in a boring, utilitarian ranch home, I had no idea that a ranch house could be as elegant as the homes in this book.  Even though the authors present some very high-end renovations, with some imagination many of the basic ideas can be translated into more economical ways of updating your home.<br /><br />The first thing you notice when flipping through the book is the sheer number and beauty of the color photographs.  There is a color photo on just about every page.  When there's not, then there is a diagram, such as \\"Fireplace Options,\\" which shows you several ways to design an updated fireplace.  Other diagrams show \\"before and after\\" floor plans, and a plan showing the early roots of the original ranch homes.  Thus, it's not just pretty pictures presented here--there's a lot of nuts and bolts information.<br /><br />The authors start off with a history of the ranch style, since it helps when updating to keep within the original concepts that the style evolved with.  I learned that the current ranch design was originally popularized by designer Cliff May in California.  But May drew inspiration from the traditional ranchos of the southwest.  These ranchos in turn had evolved over the millenia from the atrium houses of the Romans.  These ancient houses were \\"closed off\\" from the streets, whilst providing a private outdoor space for family living, the same as many ranches today.<br /><br />The authors discuss how in ranch houses form follows function.  For instance, typical ranch houses have been built with large windows to allow for passive solar heating--thus these were the some of the first energy efficient houses.  Also, there were often more large windows and glass doors in the back of the house than the front.  This is because ranches were built for privacy on the street side, with openness to the back yard in order to integrate indoor and outdoor living.  Thus in ranches, windows are designed with energy use, privacy, and enjoyment of nature in mind.  When remodeling an older ranch this information can be valuable in improving the look and functioning of the house.<br /><br />The ranch home doesn't have to be boring and ugly.  As the authors state, many ranch neighborhoods are becoming attractive to buyers again.  That's because they have shady trees, and attractive back yards with an abundance of natural beauty which can be enjoyed from the house.  The ranch design was built with adding on and remodeling in mind, so removing walls or tinkering with floor plans is often easier than with other styles of houses.  This lovely book shows you how, and will inspire you to dream of ways to do it in a more modest fashion if your budget requires economizing.d.

Ms. Karter explains the concepts behind the workouts, then presents the exercises in a graded series of three levels.  The pictures are clear and easy to follow.  (There are a couple of places where the pictures are a little different than the written explanations; in that case I do what is shown in the pictures.)  Each level has its own color code on the outer edge of the page, so you can open the book quickly to the appropriate level.<br /><br />In the first chapter Ms. Karter explains the reasons for developing the \\"core muscles,\\" that is, all the muscles extending from the the base of the neck, down the back and front of the trunk, to the pelvic floor muscles.  These muscles support your spine and interior organs, improve your posture, and help you with your balance.  Moreover, working on all these muscles together makes your body work more efficiently, which gives you more stamina.<br /><br />In the next chapter she explains the principles of proper alignment when doing the exercises.  She includes a few exercises just for getting lined up correctly.  This is very important, as it greatly affects the outcome of doing this work.  I found her explanations of these key concepts to be thorough and clear.<br /><br />The final three chapters contain the exercises, in graded levels.  You do each level for at least six weeks before moving on.  I found six weeks to be adequate for levels one and two (I'm about to move into level three at this time), however, I have a yoga background. Some people may need more time.  I could easily see spending three or more months per level, and that would be fine.  There's no hurry in learning how to move your body in this way!<br /><br />Most of the exercises are for strengthening the back and abdominal muscles.  However, there are also some for stretching the hamstrings, and developing balance, arm strength, and back flexibility.  Combining strength with flexibility exercises makes for a very satisfying workout.<br /><br />After just a few weeks of the first level I did find that I had more energy, and my posture was much taller without me constantly having to straighten myself up.  Better yet, whereas I used to use my lower back for various tasks such as vacuuming, now I work more from my inner abdominals, which has saved my back a lot of stress.  The added benefit is that my abdominals are getting a workout even when I'm off the exercise mat.  Finally, developing my inner abdominal muscles has greatly improved my breathing; I'm taking deeper breaths from the belly on a more regular basis, rather than the shallow breathing which was my former habit.<br /><br />I've found that going back to yoga after working with this book has really enhanced my yoga practice as well.  I had always been told in yoga classes to \\"work from my core,\\" but as my core was undeveloped, I couldn't really feel what the instructors were talking about.  Now I know, and I really can work from my core.<br /><br />This is a great book for improving your overall health, stamina, and appearance.w weeks of the first level I did find that I had more energy, and my posture was much taller without me constantly having to straighten myself up.

Rep Weave and Beyond is a joy to look at and read.  As a weaver of many years, this is at the top of my list of inspirational books.  First of all, it's visually beautiful, being filled with full-color photographs of the author's work, which is gorgeous.  Ms. Tallarovic lives in Arizona, and she draws inspiration for her elegant color ways from the hues of the southwest: ecru, gold, bronze, terra cotta, reds, greens, dusky purples, and turquoise.  She seems to be comfortable using both earth tones as well as more vibrant colors.  She has based many of her designs on Native American weavings and pottery patterns.  These are sensitive interpretations done with respect for the traditions she borrows from, and her incorporation of the patterns into a European weave structure works very well aesthetically.<br /><br />Second, the book is filled with projects which are clearly explained down to the last minute detail, along with color photos of each finished piece.  The author lays a good foundation for these project recipes in the first section of the book, where she outlines her method of winding a warp, dressing the loom, tying on, weaving a heading, in short--all the preliminaries every weaver should know.  Beginner weavers should find the instructions manageable.<br /><br />Ms. Tallarovic wrote this book for weavers who want to explore rep weave, but for whom the traditional Scandinavian technique might be out of reach.  Due to the very close warp setts used in the traditional version of this weave, getting a good shed on a jack loom can be a problem.  In addition, weaving rugs with setts of 90 ends per inch might be beyond the patience level of many  people.<br /><br />To make rep weave more \\"weaver friendly,\\" the author has spent years experimenting with using thicker threads at lower setts.  All of the projects in this book can be woven using Maysville cotton carpet warp, which comes in over 40 colors.  Using the Maysville cotton, her designs can be warped using setts of between 16 and 40 ends per inch.  These warps do not completely cover the weft, which ends up, as she notes, \\"producing a livelier, more dynamic surface.\\"  From what I could see in the photographs, she is correct in that regard.<br /><br />Also, as she uses printed fabric for many of her thick wefts, a layered effect happens when the block patterning of the warp threads floats over the printed pattern of the woven fabric strips.  A further innovation she has come up with is using many colors in the pattern warp, rather than the traditional two colors.<br /><br />Perhaps what I like most about this book is seeing how someone can bring a traditional weave forward into the present.  Ms. Tallarovic has furthered the evolution of this ancient weaving form.  She has added to its visual excitement, made it more accessible to the average weaver, and shown how patient experimentation can add new life to a tried and true technique.  There are so many directions each individual weaver can go with this method of weaving once s/he has mastered what the author offers in the book.  I can envision using painted warps and/or hand-dyed or painted wefts.  I can also see using oriental papers as wefts as well.  That would be only a beginning.tts of between 16 and 40 ends per inch.

We begin with \\"The First Invasion of Ireland,\\" from The Book of Invasions, and move on to some of the beautiful chants and incantations of Amergin, the chief bard of the Milesians:  \\"I am a stag:  of seven tines/I am a flood: across a plain/ I am a wind: on a deep lake/I am a tear: the Sun lets fall. . .\\" These ancient selections provide some of the best pagan Celtic reading I've come across.<br /><br />Montague then guides us through some writings of the early monastics, such as \\"Marban, A Hermit Speaks\\":  \\"Young of all things, /bring faith to me,/ guard my door:/ the rough, unloved/ wild dogs, tall deer,/ quiet does.\\"  These writings give one the sense of a people so intimately interwoven into natural patterns and rhythms that there is no feeling of separation from Nature.<br /><br />All the early selections of course are translated from the Gaelic, and we do not get into the poems written in English until later.  According to Montague's excellent introduction,  most poets composed in their native tongue until the nineteenth century, at which point most began writing in English.  \\"Irish literature in English is in the uneasy position that the larger part of its past lies in another language,\\" writes Montague.  Thus we read in Montague's own poem \\"A Grafted Tongue,\\"  \\"Dumb,/ Bloodied, the severed/ head now chokes to/ speak another tongue.\\"<br /><br />  But even before the use of Gaelic was waning, Irish culture was being systematically crushed by the British occupiers.  The war against Ireland's native culture began before Elizabethan times.  Thus, in the later poets Montague finds \\"a racial sensibility striving to be reborn; is it strange that it comes through with a mournful sound, like a medium's wail?\\":  \\"I heard the dogs howl in the moonlight night;/ I went to the window to see the sight;/ All the Dead that ever I knew/ Going one by one and two by two. . .\\"  (William Allingham (1824-1889).<br /><br />Even in the later poets of Christianized Ireland, who write in English, the pagan past is never quite obscured.  Patrick MacDonogh (1902-1961) writes in \\"Now the Holy Lamp of Love,\\" \\"Cradling hands are all too small/And your hair is drenched with dew;/ Love though strong can build no wall/ From the hungry fox for you.\\"  And Denis Devlin (1908-1959) writes in \\"Ascension\\" of a visionary experience of blinding light.  He begins with \\"Aengus, the god of Love, my shoulders brushed/With birds, you could say lark or thrush or thieves. . ./\\"  but moves on to \\"For it was God's Son foreign to our moor:/ When I looked out the window, all was white,/And what's beloved in the heart was sure,. . .\\"<br /><br />In so many of these poems there is beauty, grace, and felicity, juxtaposed with suffering and sometimes bitterness.  Contemporary poet Paul Muldoon (born 1951) writes in \\"Dancers At the Moy\\" of horses who tore \\"at briars and whins,/ Ate the flesh of each other/Like people in famine. . .The local people gathered/Up the white skeletons./Horses buried for years/Under the foundations/Give their earthen floors/The ease of trampolines.\\"  Here, suffering and loss become the foundation for continued life.<br /><br />A complex national character manifests through these poems.  Reading them, we see the English language being borne into new poetic realms by a nation for whom English is \\"a grafted tongue.\\"  A wonderful book.ne and two by two. . .\\"  (William Allingham (1824-1889).

This is not your usual trauma recovery book.  Most books on healing explain symptoms, offer exercises, and provide illuminating case histories.  Judith Herman does all this, but she goes beyond just focusing on healing oneself in isolation.  We are social animals, and must live within our culture.  Thus, how our culture regards trauma and traumatized people is very important to those trying to become reintegrated into society after massive psychic shock.  Dr. Herman explains our modern Western culture's attitudes toward trauma and the traumatized, gives a fascinating and pertinent history of how those attitudes have changed throughout the past century, and shows how those attitudes affect how survivors recover.<br /><br />Dr. Herman sets forth most of this broader cultural history in Part 1, Chapter 1, \\"A Forgotten History.\\"  She begins with the female hysteria patients of 19th Century Europe, and ends up with the Vietnam veterans' movement to demand treatment for battle induced post-traumatic stress.  The veterans' work bore fruit.  In 1980 the American Psychiatric Association included \\"post-traumatic stress disorder\\" in its official manual of mental disorders.  This paved the way in the 1980s for victims of rape, childhood abuse, and domestic violence to be treated for post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms.<br /><br />Part of the history Herman sets forth explores why people tend to shun and try to silence trauma survivors.  She writes, \\"It is very tempting to take the side of the perpetrator.  All the perpetrator asks is that the bystander do nothing.  He appeals to the universal desire to see, hear, and speak no evil.  The victim, on the contrary, asks the bystander to share the burden of pain.  The victim demands action, engagement, and remembering.\\"<br /><br />I would guess that most people recovering from trauma have experienced the dynamic of those around them \\"taking the side of the perpetrator.\\"  Without understanding why they are doing so only compounds the suffering the survivor experiences, and intensifies the feeling that one is tainted, bad, or defective for having been traumatized in the first place.  In exploring the cultural dynamics of collective repression and denial, Herman does a great service to those who must heal and re-enter a culture which can sometimes be seen to be in league with the perpetrators in our world.<br /><br />The remainder of Part 1 deals with the types of abuse and the symptoms which follow.  This information can be found in other books, but here it is set in a larger cultural context which helps the reader to make more sense out of the symptoms.<br /><br />Part 2 describes the stages of recovery.  This information is very concrete, very helpful, and hopeful as well.  Dr. Herman outlines three main stages: establishing safety, remembering and integrating one's story, and re-integrating oneself back into the social world.<br /><br />This book is probably the most helpful book I have read on trauma recovery in 20 years.  Dr. Herman's idea of exploring the social matrix in which healing occurs is brilliant.  After all, we are all connected.  We cannot heal ourselves without making some sort of peace with the culture around us.  We cannot always change the attitudes of those around us, but we can learn to understand, and thus approach those who cannot comprehend our reality with at least some measure of forgiveness and compassion.vor experiences, and intensifies the feeling that one is tainted, bad, or defective for having been traumatized in the first place.

Ms. Peirce has written a thoughtful and well-organized guide to developing our relationship with the intuitive mind. Her premise is that each person has an intuitive faculty, which is our birthright as human beings. However, some people are more in touch with this faculty than others. Thus her strategy is to show us what blocks intuition, then how to work to unblock it. The exercises she provides to help us do this take up a large part of the book. In that sense, it is more of a workbook than just a book to read.<br /><br />Part 1, entitled \\"Creating a Clear Lens,\\" walks the reader through a series of exercises to clean out habits of thought, fears, and unhelpful beliefs which most of us carry around until we do our interior housekeeping. Many exercises resemble the work that so many people do in therapy, that is, uncovering painful issues from the past and clearing them out. This clearing opens up the channel from the \\"Big Mind,\\" that is, the intuitive mind, so that we can receive guidance.<br /><br />In Part 2, \\"Accessing Subtle Information,\\" the focus turns to specific exercises for developing more sensitive perception and awareness.

I read this book because someone recommended it to me. I have mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, I believe that when we set an intention and communicate it to all physical, mental, and emotional parts of ourselves we can effect positive changes in our lives. On the other hand, I find two problems with the author's thesis.<br /><br /> First, the body/mind is not really like a corporation. Corporations are hierarchical structures with a top-down chain of command. Even in the most advanced, enlightened corporations, decisions are not made democratically. You have a board of directors or a CEO who enact policy and see that it is carried out.<br /><br /> In contrast, the body/mind is a non-hierarchical system. Its organization cannot be compared to a pyramid or a ladder, but rather is something more akin to a multi-dimensional globular webwork of relationships. All parts communicate constantly with all others, and decisions evolve out of the exigencies which the whole experiences. All parts are as necessary as others, and thus, you cannot &quot;downsize&quot; it. Many decisions happen simultaneously in the body to maintain physical and psychological homeostasis. &quot;You&quot; as supposed CEO cannot possibly track or act upon all the data that goes into maintaining homeostasis.<br /><br /> Second, the &quot;you&quot; in the title seems to refer to you as your ego-self, your persona. That's the self that wants this or that, the self that sets intentions. It's all very well and good for the ego to have desires and plans for the body/mind to carry out, but I disagree that the ego can be compared at all to a CEO. If anything should be called the CEO, it is what Jung referred to as the Self, or what some other teachings refer to as the Higher Self. All true evolution proceeds from that unseen psychic center, which, when we ignore it, can derail the best made plans of (mice and) men.<br /><br /> If one must keep with the corporate analogy, the ego is more like a middle manager, and must feel-- and create from-- the tension between the demands of the soul and the world in which the body/mind finds itself. How does the ego figure out what the Self requires? There are many good books on connecting to one's own inner wisdom, but this is not one of them. That is a shame, because neglecting that wisdom, and claiming that one's own ego is in charge of the body/mind is not only arrogant, but also counter-productive.like a middle manager, and must feel-- and create from-- the tension between the demands of the soul and the world in which the body/mind finds itself.

This elegant book will appeal to stitchers who want to experiment with cloth and thread as a fine art medium. The authors have organized the book as a course you can work through on your own, with exercises which really help you to loosen up and start exploring with your needle and thread.<br /><br />They start you out with some basic stitches with variations to play around with, then move on to cover paint and dye techniques for creating interesting background cloths. Next they explore more complex stitch ideas, design integration, and combining hand and machine stitching. Finally they investigate mark making and image making as a fine art process.<br /><br />Even without the exercises and the instructive text, the photographs themselves are worth the price of this book. There are beautiful full-color photos on almost every page. The book was published in 1999, and the work is contemporary enough to still be visually interesting. It's a shame this book did not stay in print, since it is one of the best contemporary stitching books I've seen.	2003-08-24

Matthew Scully's Dominion contains the most powerful writing I've ever read on the subject of how humans treat animals. The facts he presents are painful; reading it  literally made me lose sleep, and thus I took my time and read it in small portions. But don't avoid this book because of that.  The pain you feel while reading will only be a fraction of the pain our consumer culture causes animals every day.  What this book contains we should all know.<br /><br />The book caused a bit of a stir when it first came out.  Scully, a Christian conservative (and former speechwriter to the second George Bush), believes that animals cannot have rights since they don't have the same consciousness and abilities as do humans.  This argument inflamed some camps in the animal rights movement.  However, Scully's writing and research are so meticulous, his compassion so apparent, and his outrage so palpable, that many in the movement rallied around him and the book.  And the fact that a conservative wrote this book, and later went on to speak out in venues that are generally out of reach of most animal welfare proponents, was a great service to animals and people who care about them.<br /><br />The title Dominion refers to the story from the book of Genesis, in which God gives Adam dominion over the animal kingdom. As Scully points out, this term \\"dominion\\" does not mean license to exploit or cause to suffer; rather, it refers to an attitude of responsible, appreciative stewardship. And \\"appreciative\\" is a keyword here.  The author gives enough anecdotes of animals' amazing abilities to feel, love, and think, that we cannot reasonably refuse them a much greater portion of admiration than what we've given so far.  Indeed, after the catalogue of methods, organized by chapter, with which we exploit and abuse them--sometimes for profit, and other times for pleasure--it becomes clear that regardless of how many self-professed \\"animal lovers\\" there may be, our commercial and legal systems consider animals as little more than dead objects.<br /><br />Having given up on mainstream Christianity over the very issue of how we treat the natural world and the beings who inhabit it, I was pleasantly surprised by Scully's emphasis on our responsibility for the choices we make in regards to how we treat all creatures. His book might cause remorse and pain, but it certainly demands action. Understanding the suffering we consumers cause by our purchasing acts, we can only maintain our integrity by changing what we choose to support with our dollars. Thus be prepared to face some difficult choices and behavior changes while reading this book.<br /><br />In fact, many readers will probably become active advocates for the better treatment of animals. As for those who can read this book and continue with old habits that cause grievous suffering--they are either morally lazy or have hearts totally bereft of compassion. If that sounds like a judgment, it is! Changing ourselves for the better takes work, but it's worth it in order to create a  just world, and to maintain our individual and collective integrity.ls as little more than dead objects.

Microcosmos is a natural history of the unseen beings upon whom we depend every moment for survival: the microbes. Margulis, who is currently Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Geology at the University of Massachusetts, did undergraduate work in biology and received her PhD in Genetics. She worked with James Lovelock on developing the Gaia theory, which posits that the earth can be regarded as a sort of super-organism. In Microcosmos we see all aspects of her education and sensibilities -- a close attention to scientific detail and a &quot;big picture&quot; approach to how living entities coexist.<br />In the introduction she lays out her philosophy about life on earth, for which she was roundly criticized by many reductionist scientists. In the past, she writes, all life on Earth was traditionally studied as being merely a prelude to the appearance of humans. Now, overwhelming evidence suggests that microbes (one-celled organisms) not only inhabit every known living thing on earth, they are also indispensable to the survival of all living things. They, not human beings, are the most important beings on the planet.<br />Furthermore, in opposition to one of the most accepted tenets of Neo-Darwinism, Margulis states that life did not colonize the planet by competition so much as by networking. Cooperation between one-celled creatures led, over billions of years, to the evolution of beings such as ourselves, who possess the capability for self-conscious awareness. Our human consciousness, of which we are so proud, &quot;may have been born of the concerted capacities of millions of microbes that evolved symbiotically to become the human brain.&quot;<br />Strong words! Yet, Margulis sets forth compelling evidence in the remainder of her book to support her bio-philosophical ideas. Along the way, we learn many amazing things. For instance, we get a perspective on what upstart newcomers we are: the continents we inhabit now appeared in their present locations only in the last tenth of a percent of Earth's history. We learn that bacteria invented genetic engineering. Thus, when ultraviolet light damaged early microbes' DNA, the creatures produced repair enzymes to remove the damaged portions and copy new replacement DNA. This is a natural form of gene splicing.<br />Sometimes, the DNA used in gene splicing was borrowed from neighboring bacteria of different strains, thus affording these critters a prodigious adaptability. This borrowing still goes on today. Through intermediaries, two very different bacteria can share genetic information. Why is this important? Because it allows the distribution of genetic information in the microcosm with a speed &quot;approaching that of modern telecommunications--if the complexity and biological value of the information being transferred is factored in.&quot; This speed makes bacteria the biosphere's first responders in dealing with planetary changes.<br />In responding to change, bacteria end up altering and shaping their environments. Few people realize that the entire earth's atmosphere, which we depend on for our life's breath, was created, and is maintained, by microbes. This is a good thing to remember next time you feel like spraying down your bathroom or kitchen with anti-microbial spray. Our fear of bacteria is misplaced. Yes, some are harmful to us, but most are beneficial. Indeed they are a lot more helpful to us than we are to the rest of the planet!<br />This book isn't an easy read, but it will broaden one's outlook on our place in the natural world. Even if bacteria are not in the end responsible for the intricacies of our human brain and consciousness, we still owe them many debts. This book unveils the smallness of humans before the vast and minute workings of nature, and encourages a sense of humility before the greater Life that surrounds us.ocations only in the last tenth of a percent of Earth's history.

I remember the first time I saw pigeons; I was five years old and had been taken into Washington, D.C. on a field trip.  There was a group of them on the sidewalk near the Natural History Museum, strutting around a food cart.  I took one look at their iridescent necks, gray and buff bodies, and inquisitive orange eyes, and I was hooked.  Never mind that the adult who accompanied us sneered, \\"Oh, they're just vermin.\\"  Being a child, I knew better than to listen to someone who was unable to see beauty when it was staring her in the face.<br /><br />In this book, Ms. Patent gives children a view of pigeons for what they really are, touching on their beauty, their intelligence, and the benefits they have brought to mankind throughout history.  The color photographs by William Munos are excellent and complement the text well.  The photos appear on almost every page, which makes the book easy to read to children who like visuals during reading time.<br /><br />Adults can enjoy the book as well.  For those of us who love pigeons, it's difficult locating books about them, especially books specifically about rock doves (our feral city pigeons).  This book is a great start.  Although it's a slim volume, it offers quite a bit of scientifically accurate information.<br /><br />I now have a pair of pigeons nesting in a double nesting box on the back of my house, plus numerous pigeons visiting my feeding site every day.  I never get over my fascination with these gentle, intelligent creatures, who are, by the way, magnificent flyers.  This book has helped broaden my knowledge of these wonderful birds.	2003-06-01

Thus I approached it with a good deal of open-minded interest. However, I was not able to finish the book, and certain of its claims disturbed me.<br />Hawkins' main thesis is that you can use kinesiological testing to test the objective truth of a statement. In the form of testing he uses, the subject stretches out his arm. The querent makes a statement such as \\"artificial sweeteners are good for you.\\" If the subject can maintain his arm outstretched under a firm push from the querent, the statement is accepted as true. If the subject's arm can be pushed down, the statement is false.<br />Hawkins maintains that he used this testing on the statements and ideas presented in the book, and concluded that \\"the level of truth of this edition of the work has been calibrated at 810, which is unusually high for this time in our culture.\\" Perhaps using his own method was the only way to test the objective truth of the book, however, it is unscientific to test a method of inquiry using the method itself. It's a circular dynamic, much like having the Los Angeles Police Department make an inquiry into how well the LAPD is doing its job.<br />Another reservation I had about the book concerned the belief that the Truth is out there floating around, just waiting to be nailed down by some perfect method of apprehension. Whether or not this is true is a philosophical question that ultimately has no answer. However, I have noticed that in regards to many questions one may find as many truths out there as there are people viewing whatever for them is the truth. For instance, in the case of the artificial sweetener test, such sweeteners may indeed be bad for some people, and have no harmful effects on others. People can live to ripe old ages on a steady diet of saccharine, caffeine, cigarettes, and hostess twinkies. Even if some cosmic force declares those items \\"bad,\\" are they really bad for the people who live, and even seem to thrive in some cases, on a steady diet of those items?<br />My third and final reservation had to do with the fact that I tried this method of testing on several people, using the artificial sweetener example. It didn't work. When I stated that sweeteners are good for you, all of my test subjects held their arms up. Then I tested them using other, more personal, statements, trying to get their arm strength to weaken. It never did. I am willing to concede that just maybe I carried out the test inappropriately, but at this point I'm bored with the whole exercise. I don't really want to live in a world where Ultimate Truth can be acquired, catalogued, and used in battles for hearts, minds, and bodies.Even if some cosmic force declares those items \\"bad,\\" are they really bad for the people who live, and even seem to thrive in some cases, on a steady diet of those items?<br />My third and final reservation had to do with the fact that I tried this method of testing on several people, using the artificial sweetener example.

These animal stories were banned in the late sixties from many schools and libraries for being racist (the storyteller in the book, Uncle Remus, is a slave and uses the \\"n\\" word).  But it seems that it's now ok to like these stories again, and a good thing that is,  because they are not only hilariously funny, they are also deeply revealing of the foibles of us humans.  But perhaps most importantly, they are a treasure trove of African American folklore.<br /><br />The stories combine folktale motifs brought from Africa by slaves with those of the native peoples of the south, particularly the Cherokee and Choctaw.  Since both cultures had stories with animal characters, and specifically trickster rabbit characters, ethnologists have not been able to completely determine which elements are the African and which are the Native American.  No matter, since the two storytelling traditions blend together seamlessly.<br /><br />This edition is the most encyclopedic of all the Uncle Remus collections, and contains many different types of tales.  There are origin tales, like how Mr. Dog originally came to live with Mr. Man and why Mr. Cricket has elbows on his legs.  There are satirical tales, like the one in which Brer Rabbit convinces Brer Fox that it's the fashion in town for up-to-date foxes to have their heads cut off, which is information that Brer Fox, out of vanity, acts on in the way Brer Rabbit hopes.  There are Trickster tales --mostly involving Brer Rabbit and Brer Tortoise (who is the only character who can out-trickster Rabbit).  And there are tales of witches, magic, and superstition specific to Africa.<br /><br />It's written in Southern African-American dialect of the 19th century, which can be tough going for some, but there is a glossary in the back (which I didn't realize was there for over a year) that helps.  Also, the stories demand to be read out loud, being originally of an oral tradition, and I think you will find that reading them aloud while just following the given spelling will make the dialect more understandable than just reading it silently.<br /><br />These stories are so wonderful that my teenaged sons, who think it's \\"babyish\\" to be read to, will still allow me to read Brer Rabbit tales to them.  If you are looking for great Literature that's funny and easy to read, buy this book and have a really good time!lling will make the dialect more understandable than just reading it silently.

John Ruskin, the 19th Century English man of letters, believed that any business deal that isn't beneficial to both parties is not business but trickery.  In this book Donald Wayne Mitchell outlines ways to take your business to the top by creating (and subsequently adapting) business models that benefit all stakeholders in the business.  His term \\"stakeholders\\" includes more than just shareholders and customers.  In Mitchell's vision, end users, employees, partners, suppliers, distributors, lenders and communities in which the business operates (so important!) must all be taken into consideration.<br />You can think of this book as presenting an ecology of the business world, in which your particular \\"organism\\" must learn to survive and prosper.  And just as in ecosystems competition is one driver of evolution, so also in business.  That idea is old hat, and business people have never seemed to tire of the adage \\"survival of the fittest.\\"  However, organisms that can cooperate compete even better than those that work alone.  This works for companies as well, where a focus on working with and helping others enhances one's own strength.  Furthermore, organisms that cannot adapt will not ultimately survive, as the living world is in constant flux.  The same is true in the business world, where using the same business model year after year is a prescription for extinction.<br />Mitchell effectively shows how to work with both of these concepts.  Using many examples from real life businesses, he demonstrates how to build relationships -- but not by focusing on the usual manipulative Dale Carnegie type techniques (many of which were subsequently appropriated by the CIA for use in interrogations, by the way).  Rather, Mitchell's way is to put yourself in the other person's shoes in order to figure out what that person needs.  For instance, if you can figure out how to help your customers access more customers, you can build more business for yourself as well as for those to whom you sell.<br />As for continuously adapting your business model to reflect changing conditions, Mitchell warns that this has little to do with simply implementing new technology.  Rather, it's about constantly monitoring and changing how you do business.  He concedes it's a challenge and can be expensive.  Using a detailed list of steps he walks the reader through the necessary phases -- from idea generation to testing to execution -- and then expands on those with excellent examples from businesses which he has studied.<br />In order to write this book, Mitchell and his associates studied businesses of many types and sizes and interviewed what must have been hundreds of managers and CEOs.  The material is well organized and presented in workbook style, with questions for thought at the end of each section.  The order of presentation is clear and logical, which makes the reading understandable even for someone (like me) who doesn't have an MBA.<br />But what I value most about this book are the positive principles it encourages.  Especially in the current corporate atmosphere, we need more CEOs and managers who are willing to live by words such as \\"avoid business models that harm more than help any stakeholder,\\" and \\"Treat all stakeholders as considerately as you would a customer whom you could not afford to lose.\\"  Brilliant!  With more teachings like these, perhaps we really will be able to look forward to an era in which prosperity and responsible, mindful business practices help to create a world which meets the needs of all its inhabitants.to whom you sell.<br />As for continuously adapting your business model to reflect changing conditions, Mitchell warns that this has little to do with simply implementing new technology.

It is a work of philosophy about how our perceptions are conditioned by the world view of the culture we are raised in. Each human being carries a \\"lens\\" through which he perceives everything that happens around and within himself, and with which he filters out bits of information which do not jive with the lens he carries. Our lenses are a product of family, school, workplace, regional, religious, and national influences--indeed there are many layers to each person's lens, and the layers begin to be formed when we are infants and continue to be added on throughout our formative years.<br />The consensus reality of one's community therefore bestows upon each individual a field of knowledge, and this field determines what new knowledge we pick up. It is this field which Bruteau refers to as the \\"psychic grid.\\" There are a multitude of psychic grids. They are simply different belief niches which people can inhabit. You might think of them as subcultures. No one psychic grid is \\"right,\\" according to Bruteau. What makes a psychic grid \\"right\\" is if it works for a group of people, if it allows them to find meaning. If it does not, it will be replaced.<br />Since The Psychic Grid addresses the question of how we can know what is real, it is a work of epistemology. However, it goes beyond rational epistemology, since the author presupposes a spiritual realm, or higher reality, which can only be approached intuitively. This higher reality stands behind, or you could say beyond, beneath, or above, the material world in which most of us spend our thinking lives. But just like the material world around us, we cannot perceive it as it really is, but only through one or another lens. According to Bruteau, you can never jump outside of your lens, and perceive what is REALLY there.

Even though D'Haene's relationships with his siblings and loving mother are positive, it does not erase his suffering.  In fact, all the family members suffer at the hands of the father; no one is spared. And no one is able to stop the father's abuses, even when the mother finally moves her children out of the home.  D'Haene writes of his rural Canadian small town, where, even when other adults in the community find out about what is going on in his home, nothing is done to help or protect his family.  Thus he touches on a dynamic that too few people are willing to grapple with:  for every perpetrator there is a cadre of people in his community willing to aid and abet him by doing nothing or not enough to intervene.<br /><br /> Despite the horror that D'Haene recounts, the book is a very good read.  The story pulls you in and moves right along.  D'Haene's characterizations are well-drawn, utilizing just the right details to give us wonderful snapshots of the various members of his immediate and extended family.  Also, he provides some interesting background on his parents' families and the milieu they were raised in (both parents were emigres from Belgium), thus giving us a context to help us understand the dynamics of his immediate family.  Moreover, the family background gives food for thought to those of us who wonder about nature vs. nurture in regards to family abuse.  It seems that D'Haene's abusive father grew up in a family of hard-working decent people, so anyone wanting to discover the origin of his mental affliction will have to look elsewhere to find a contributing factor.<br /><br />D'Haene's story makes for painful reading, especially for people who've had similar experiences.  However, there is hope in these pages, which are written by a due man who, although raised in an atmosphere of violence and cruelty, seems never to have abandoned his own gentle and loving nature.  Thus the story illuminates one of our greatest strengths as human beings:  the potential resilience of the individual soul.his own gentle and loving nature.

The reader learns only a little about the strategy and tactics used by the Soviet forces to fight the war in neighboring Afghanistan. Rather, this is a document that reflects the process of maturation of its author. He starts as a 19-year-old man being drafted into the Russian army. His naivet&eacute; in volunteering for the commandos (which will take him in short order into the task of defusing enemy mines) mirrors the bravado and sense of indestructibility that is the main reason that men of his age have been used as soldiers for as long as there have been armies.<br />The story is told in episodes - not as plot for it's own sake, but rather to communicate the range of emotions and intensity of fear unique to the battlefield soldier. Some of my favorite writing comes from letters sent home by Confederate and Union soldiers from America's civil war.  These documents are important not because of the credentials or social standing of the writers, but instead because of the intensity of the experiences these writers were living. Vladislav Tamarov continues this venerable tradition and extends the genre to new depths of insight. Probably the most obvious lesson learned was that after such a prolonged ordeal, one cannot \\"go home again\\". The effects of fighting the fghan war changed Mr. Tamarov's values so much that he was unable to fit back into the life that he idolized and longed to survive long enough to resume. We all know many stories of disaffected soldiers who live out their lives on the bitter fringes of society. Mr. Tamarov provides hope not only through his own strength and resiliency, but, later in the book, by his activism and involvement with international veterans groups to improve the lives of men often forgotten by all of us.<br />A parallel story of maturation is told by the wonderful series of photographs that illustrate the book. These pictures chronicle not only the events in his story, but more importantly, give the reader a glimpse into the development of author's remarkable photographic artistic maturation. The photos give the book a visceral link to that timeless reality captured best by a photographer of Mr. Tamarov's skill. It certainly left me wanting to follow-up more of his later work.<br />I highly recommend Afghanistan A Russian Soldier's story. Because it is so personal, it resonates deeply with the universal things that unite us as humans. It is set against the backdrop of a futile war in a foreign land, and then home transformed into the unfamiliar. The development of his personal strength to transform his savage experience into something that makes him a stronger man is inspiring. I especially recommend this book to those who appreciate war memoirs, those who like books about personal transformation, and to all who love great photographs.<br />Jeffrey Lyonvents in his story, but more importantly, give the reader a glimpse into the development of author's remarkable photographic artistic maturation.

US	52844418	R2ZJ5QVHK4SS5O	1567184499	379537200	Guide to The Pythagorean Tarot	Books	5	61	63	N	Y	A great resource for understanding the Tarot.	The subtitle of this book is &quot;An Interpretation Based on Pythagorean and Alchemical Principles,&quot; and as such it gives a broad introduction to the symbols at the root of Western occult iconography.<br />In his introduction Opsopaus writes that he's written the book for neopagans who are dissatisfied with traditional decks based on the theology and esotericism of the late Renaissance.  But that doesn't mean the book isn't useful for traditionalists as well.  After all, much of the esoteric though of the Renaissance grew out of Pythagoras' thought and the Greek mystery traditions.  I use traditional decks myself, but I reference this book constantly.<br />In fact, anyone interested in the history of symbols will find a wealth of material in this book.  The bibliography in the back is absolutely wonderful.  The section on Pythagorean numerology is the best I have read on that subject.<br />In addition, the cards are beautiful; the symbols are different than a traditional deck, but not so different that you can't recognize immediately which major arcana card you're looking at.  The pip cards have no pictures, which is the way the early tarot decks were created.  However, their meanings are easily derived by combining the numerological information with the element qualities.  Opsopaus does this in his section on the pip cards.<br />The book starts out with a section on the background of the metaphysical ideas the author deals with, then goes on to sections on the major, then the minor arcana.  The fourth section covers divination thoroughly and with some wonderful insights not covered in other books.<br />I first found out about Opsopaus' tarot writings on his encyclopaedic website, which has the same name as the book.  I originally tried printing out the website material (before the book was published), but there was just too much.  I've found the book to be a must-have in my Tarot library. It's not only scholarly but also very readable, which makes for a good learning experience.learning experience.	2002-07-22

This book has opened up a whole new world of technical analysis for me. The subject matter is fascinating--the Japanese make everything they do into an art, and charting is no exception. These chart patterns are easy to learn because they make intuitive sense. Nison points out (wherever relevant) what each formation means in terms of market psychology and sentiment. The &quot;emotional&quot; side of the market is much more difficult to read using Western techniques -- at least for me. But with candlesticks I can really get a gut feeling for what is going on, in addition to a clearer analytical view. Nison is an excellent writer and makes everything clear and understandable. He includes an introduction on the history of candlesticks which is interesting. The book is beautifully layed out, with plenty of room in the margins for making notes. The charts are easy to read.<br />I cannot recommend this book enough.	2001-09-06

I just dug out an old copy of this book that I have had for over 40 years. ..This was one book I kept by my bed when I was growing up--from my earliest years on up into my teens. Everytime I opened it, it seemed fresh and new, and it still does. It is a wonderful collection of poems and quirky stories selected by Jane Werner, with beautiful illustrations by Garth Williams. His pictures are not just great looking--they pull you into the scenes. Some of these pictures I kept in my head for years in my 20s and 30s--sometimes pulling the book out to take a look at the real thing. Many of the poems I still know from heart, simply from having read them so many times. In fact, I think my love of poetry started with this book. Hopefully TTBoMB will be brought back into print. It is one of the finest pieces of childrens' literature that has ever been published.	2001-08-27

This book is excellent for a number of reasons. The detailed descriptions of how to do the postures are wonderful. There are excellent hints for progressing through difficult postures, including some really helpful exercises for helping you get your hip joints in shape to do the lotus pose. Erich really understands how the different poses affect the physical body and the energy field, and imparts this knowledge clearly and eloquently.<br /><br />There is a whole section on breathing with the postures which I've not seen done so well in any other book. Also, he explains his concept of \\"lines of energy\\" which really bring the postures alive.  A line of energy is a directional path of force that moves through your body during a pose.  For instance, when you are doing the Mountain (basic standing) pose, you allow two lines of energy to develop:  one which starts at the navel and runs down through your legs and feet, anchoring you down into the earth; the other lifting you from the navel upwards through the crown of your head. Understanding these lines helps the practitioner to experience each pose as a way of reorienting one's energy, rather than just a set of muscle stretches.<br /><br />Perhaps Erich's greatest contribution to the yoga literature is his way of explaining how asana practice goes with meditation practice. Before, I was never sure how asanas fit in with the rest of yoga practice. Now I understand a lot better. I found Erich's spiritual writings very unpretentious and inspiring. The meditation exercises are wonderful both for beginners as well as people who've been meditating for a while.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book from a teacher who knows his subject well and who seems to have a truly open heart. I would love to take a class from him someday.	2001-03-05

The first night I had this book I began writing with my left hand, even though I really thought I couldn't do it.  Not only was I able to do it, but it opened up a new world to me.  The act of writing--which is usually dominated by the left, logical brain--suddenly became more intuitive, freer, and much more of an adventure.  The blank page was no longer a threat or obstacle to overcome, but an invitation for my inner voice to speak.<br />The next of the book's exercises which  I took up was mirror-writing with the left hand-that is, writing so that the text is legible when held in front of a mirror.  It really didn't take that long to learn, and the results have been a very powerful unlocking of insights, memories, dreams, and creative thoughts.  Ms. Capacchione mentions that Leonardo da Vinci mirror-wrote his journals, probably with his \\"other\\" hand, and I can certainly attest to the fact that it opens up new avenues of instinct, imagination, and intuition to anyone who wants to try it.<br />This book is not long and is easy to work with.  The first chapter includes an interesting history of humans' cultural preference for the the right hand, along with a good introduction to right/left brain theory.  All the exercises can easily be tailored to your own specific needs.  I do agree with Ms. Capacchione that there is much healing and personal growth to be gained by silencing the critical left-brain using your non-dominant hand-voices will emerge on the page which you never knew you had living within yourself.  I recommend this book for writers, artists, metaphysicians, scientists, people recovering from abuse, people facing dread diseases, to name only a few of the possible beneficiaries.  A wonderful, eye (and brain)-opening book.	2001-02-08

The Spell of the Sensuous reveals how our Western worldview has evolved to be based on literacy, abstract thought, and separation from the body. By \\"the body\\" I mean not just our individual, animal bodies, but the body of the earth and the material cosmos. By removing ourselves from this sensuous realm, we have lost the connection to \\"the living dream that we share with the soaring hawk, the spider, and the stone silently sprouting lichens on its coarse surface.\\"<br /><br />There is a paradox here, because Abrams' book exposes the drawbacks of literacy and abstract, logical thinking. But it is itself a piece of very well-argued written discourse. However, it works, and not just because Abrams' arguments are so convincing. Part of their power stems from the fact that Abrams is an artist; he has the gift of using words and imagery that can reach below the logical brain to inspire a more direct way of perceiving the world. The result is a book which is a moving combination of philosophical writing and pure poetry.<br /><br />Abrams works from a phenomenological standpoint, and the book begins with a discussion of phenomenology's history and major ideas.* This is a readable and unintimidating introduction to the subject. Abrams then proceeds to show how, starting at the time of alphabetization, the Western mind began to grow away from direct physical knowing of the world and toward abstract, conceptual representations. Our language became removed from nature, and helped us to remove ourselves from it and to inhabit an almost entirely human-centered world.<br /><br />As a counterpoint to the Western use of language, Abrams goes on to show how people in non-literate cultures use language as a way to connect with the body and the physical realm. In these oral cultures language \\"is experienced not as the exclusive property of humankind, but as a property of the sensuous life-world.\\" In other words, the world--the animals, plants, stones, wind--speaks a language that most of us can no longer hear. Abrams explores indigenous oral poetry and stories to illustrate this entirely other way of experiencing language.<br /><br />My first reading of this book triggered a conversion of sorts. It spun me 180 degrees, from the world of concepts to the world of immediate perception. I'm on my third reading now and still incorporating teachings passed over previously. I am finding that returning my gaze to the  uninterpreted physical world is a difficult practice, as I have been conditioned (like most Westerners) to run my experience through a filter of concepts and judgments.  But, like meditation, this practice can help to loosen one's psyche from its \\"mind-forg'd manacles.\\"  For this reason, The Spell of the Sensuous is really a manual for liberating one's inner and outer vision.<br /><br />*Phenomenology is the study of how we experience consciousness.  Unlike many branches of philosophy which rely on arguments built in logical steps, phenomenology is more about how we perceive and feel the immediate play of events around and within ourselves.  Thus it is less abstract and more experiential than many branches of philosophy.

Unlike many Catholic clergy whom I've met over the years, he is definitely not afraid of his shadow!  Or yours or mine....he sees the shadow as containing great power and beauty, if we can only stop avoiding the teachings contained within it.<br />The book contains essays which lead you down the path of doing &quot;shadow work,&quot; with each essay followed by a section of journal exercises and topics to think about.  These &quot;to do&quot; sections help the reader to work with the ideas in the book, rather than just read about them.  Not all the exercises will appeal to everyone, but there is such a wide range offered in each section that there is surely something for every reader.<br />My only problem with the book was that at times it was repetitive and wordy.  However, Richo offers so much that is wise and profound that I readily forgave him and kept reading.<br />One of the things I found most helpful in this book was his excellent chapter on the positive shadow, an idea with which I was unfamiliar.  The positive shadow needs attention just as much as the negative, and providing that attention is pleasant work--thus it balances out the sometimes toilsome aspect of dealing with one's darker side.<br />This is not a book to read and set aside.  It's meant to be worked.  The more people do this work, the more compassion and harmony there will be in our world.	2000-12-29

The strongest chapters are the first few, in which Murphy gives the background of the I Ching and talks about synchronicity and the linkage between the subconscious and universal minds.  His description of how to consult the oracle (using pennies) is very clear and easy for any novice to understand.  As far as his view of the I Ching goes, he sees it as being closely connected in spirit with Western metaphysical thinking.  The entire second half of the book comprises the interpretations of the hexagrams, using biblical passages instead of the original Chinese judgements and images.  For me this doesn't really work, as most of Murphy's biblically based interpretations are far too general to have much application.  Like the newspaper horoscopes, with imagination they could be interpreted any old way.<br />Thus, if you are a purist who wants a translation of the I Ching which most closely follows the Chinese version, I would not recommend this.  I would instead go with the Wilhelm/Barnes version published by Bollingen--this is the translation Jung used and it's very good reading in and of itself.  However, for learning to use the I Ching, Murphy's book is a fine introduction.	2000-12-19

This is a huge binder-sized book, packed with so much information it's a bit daunting at first. But it's worth the work, as it is one of the best books around for people who want to learn the art and science of trading in a disciplined fashion.  Miner focuses his teachings on ideas developed by Gann and Elliot having to do with dynamic ratios and patterns in financial markets. Thus there is a lot here about Elliot wave analysis and Fibonacci ratios. However, he tempers these academic theories with a heavy dose of common sense practicality, which makes them much more usable for traders.  The book begins with chapters on analyzing chart patterns using Elliot wave principles, dynamic price analysis, and dynamic time analysis. The remaining chapters focus on how to use this information in everyday trading.  In reading these final chapters I realized areas in my own trading that could use improvement-compared to Miner's rigorous method, mine has been a bit sloppy.<br />Robert Miner is not only an expert in his field, he is also obviously an experienced teacher who knows how to present information in the proper steps for maximum learning. He has a very interesting mind-he's one of those rare people who has a metaphysician's visionary propensities coupled with a very down-to-earth common sense and dry wit. Thus the book, though at times difficult, is never dry or pedestrian.	2000-12-14

This book has one of the best explanations of how to do card weaving that I have seen. Crockett has you weaving within an hour or so after reading the directions. My only reservation concerns her instructions for winding the warp for the first project. I would recommend that beginners start with a short warp to minimize tangling.  After the first project you advance to other methods, and later in the book there is a way to warp which does away with the problem of tangling.  Overall, she gives clear explanations of both the mechanics of card-weaving and pattern design.  The book is more than a just a how-to manual. It has sections on the history of this ancient art, and explores the contemporary use of this medium by fiber artists. It's the sort of book that, if you see it in a bookstore, you want to buy it. There are a lot of gorgeous color photogaphs so it's really beautiful to look at. The overall flavor of the book design and photos is contemporary. I suppose that in 30 years it might seem dated, in the same way that textile books from the 70s often seem dated to us now. However, some of those books still attract the eye, and I predict that in a few decades this one will probably do the same.	2000-12-14

For millenia, naturalists and artists have observed repeating geometrical patterns in natural objects.  For example, many two- and three- dimensional structures (such as leaves and seashells) have dimensions that reflect the phi ratio, which is (approximately) 1 to 1.618034.  This ratio, known amongst the Greeks as the Golden Mean, and used extensively in their sculpture and architecture, lends structural stability, as well as aesthetic balance, to objects into which it is incorporated.<br /><br />In The Power of Limits, Doczi, an architect, explores some of these basic ratios underlying structures found in the universe-both natural and manmade. He provides beautiful graphics on each page--photographs, drawings, and diagrams, all in black and white. The images illustrate the concepts presented in the text. There is a lot here about dynamic symmetry and Fibonacci number relationships (which gave us the dimensions for the 8 1/2 x 11 inch page and the 3 x 5 index card). But Doczi also searches for the deeper principle which organizes the harmonic ratios of the Fibonacci numbers. His term for this principle is \\"dinergy.\\" It is a combination of the Greek word \\"dia,\\" meaning opposite, and \\"energy. \\" Dinergy refers to the generative power of the union of opposites, and according to Doczi, it organizes all the harmonic patterns which combine into physical forms. Each chapter explores dinergy in a different context, such as plants, crafts, animals, art, and philosophy.<br /><br />While it is true that there are indeed repeating patterns that we can discern in nature, and which lend beauty to our man-made objects, there are those who have criticized the work of Doczi and his predecessors for engaging in a sort of \\"number mysticism\\" without scientific support.  The concept of dinergy resembles the Taoists' Yin and Yang, the two opposite principles which animate each other and the cosmos. In this, Doczi's work does more resemble mysticism than science.  The confusion arises because he uses natural forms to \\"prove\\" his theory, thus blurring the line between science and mysticism.<br /><br />However, this is only a problem if you believe there should always be a line between those two fields. Sometimes, it's true, the twain ought not to meet, but there are other times--for instance, when the imagination needs activating-- when the union of those two opposites can be very fruitful.  I find that the author's quest for the geometry of harmony takes me on a compelling journey into the beauty of the natural world, and within the confines of the book his arguments work.<br /><br />Another criticism of  Doczi's work is based on the fact that much of nature is chaotic, that is, having a deep organization that is not readily apprehended by the human mind.  It's certainly true that we cannot reduce everything to these geometrical principles, without vastly oversimplifying the universe, nor should we want to do so.  However, there is certainly much to be gained by appreciating harmony and order where we find it, and making use of it in our own designs.  The Power of Limits serves as a primer for thinking about shape, ratio, natural form and aesthetics in the world that is readily apparent to our eyes.tural forms to \\"prove\\" his theory, thus blurring the line between science and mysticism.

His thesis is that you cannot create what you desire in life until you change the underlying structures that make your life what it currently is. Changing those structures does not have to do with problem solving either. It has to do with figuring out what you do want (harder than it sounds) and then using the creative process to set in motion the forces to accomplish whatever that is.<br /><br />Fritz is a professional musician with a clear understanding of the artistic process. However, he takes this process well beyond the arts and applies it to life in general. He has worked with groups who have used these principles in foreign aid projects and business; he's also worked with individuals who have changed their personal and professional lives for the better. The point is that creativity is not just for artists--it's a human concern. If we all understood how to create rather than to just react to what life throws at us, the world would be a happier place. This is a hopeful, inspiring which should benefit anyone wanting to live a well-crafted life.	2000-10-23

He also provides some very sober observations on how technological culture has exploited other species, what we have lost as a result, and how to begin repairing the damage to ourselves and other creatures.  Overall the book inspires hope as well as a greater sense of connection to the beings we share the planet with.<br />My edition of this book is subtitled &quot;The Art and Science of Interspecies Communication.&quot;  I have to say that there is more art than science here, although not because the author hasn't given some thought as to how to carry out his work scientifically.  The problem is that his view of how to carry out interspecies communication studies is innovative and not yet generally accepted by the scientific community.  There are only a handful of people carrying out such work, which makes for anecdotal rather than statistically valid results.<br />Nollman's approach differs from the old style of teaching language to chimps, parrots, and dolphins in that it is not human-centered.  He writes:  &quot;....all...the formalized experiments in interspecies communication share one serious flaw.  Every one of them starts by asking the question:  Can an animal be taught to communicate with a human being?  The animal is the subject, held in a captive situation, and then carefully programmed to learn to give and receive information 'the way that humans do it'.....all we have accomplished is to learn that a chimpanzee, or a dolphin, or whatever animal, can act just a little more like a human being than we had prviously believed possible....&quot;<br />Nollman's alternative is based on mutual respect.  Go among the animals in their own environments, participate rather than observe, and find a medium of communication that transcends the human sphere.  For Nollman, this medium is music.  Using rhythm, tone, chord progressions, and sound textures, he establishes contact with various species, and draws them into musical &quot;dialogs.&quot;  Sometimes he strikes out, and things don't work out as planned (he's very honest).  Other times the results are amazing and yes, awe-inspiring.<br />This book will probably most appeal to those who already have a sense of connection to other living things.  I imagine that most reductionists would not make it very far into the book.  It's too bad, because although Nollman is an artist and a very open-hearted, empathic human being, he is also good at using logic and science to bolster his point of view.  Perhaps the entire crux of his argument against the &quot;animals as machines&quot; school of thought is summed up in what he terms the &quot;Bambi Syndrome.&quot;  This is the mode of thinking used by skeptics who &quot;cannot accept the reality of animal consciousness until an animal possessed of human consciousness appears on the scene.&quot;and sound textures, he establishes contact with various species, and draws them into musical &quot;dialogs.&quot;  Sometimes he strikes out, and things don't work out as planned (he's very honest).

Evans' thesis is that low-priced  and depressed stocks account for the major stock gains.  In the first chapter he outlines the risks in buying these stocks and some precautions to take.  The second chapter covers technical analysis, and the third chapter covers using the technicals to evaluate the charts of companies that have gone through major pullbacks, built bases, and seem ready to go up again.  Chapters two and three are excellent, and really seem to be the book's center of gravity.  However, later chapters go into numerous case studies which are very good teaching stories.  The writing is accessible and clear, and should appeal to beginners as well as more advanced investors and traders.	2000-10-09

Most of the images, reproduced in line drawings and black-and-white photos, are taken from Neolithic European village sites dating back as far as 7,000 B.C.  Thus they are, for the most part, a product of agricultural cultures.  However, there is a striking similarity between some of these marks and those found on relics from Paleolithic hunter-gatherer sites, examples of which appear in this book.<br /><br />The link between the images from Neolithic and Paleolithic sites arises at least in part from those cultures' shared worship of the Goddess. In the text accompanying the images, Gimbutas tries to reconstruct the world-view of the European Goddess-centered people.  She works by inference, looking at various found objects and their markings--not just in their historical context but also in relation to each other.<br /><br />For instance, in her chapter entitled \\"Net Motif,\\" she writes, \\"Signs associated with the framed net -- parallel lines, zig-zags, tri-lines, M's, and chevrons -- place it within the aquatic symbol family. . .the framed net also appears with symbols of becoming: egg, vulva, uterus, fish bladder forms, and plant leaves.  This implies that the net is linked with aqua-cosmogony, the life source, and the birth of human, animal, and plant life. . .in other words, it must have been a symbol of the \\"water of life\\" well known to us from myths. The net design. . .probably emphasizes the life-giving power of the Goddess.\\"<br /><br />It is interesting that we still speak of \\"the web of life,\\" and the \\"interconnectedness of all beings.\\"  The web is an ancient image, and just one of many in the book that readers can recognize as still resonating for us now. Some other images which Gimbutas presents are Meander and Water Birds, Streams, Tri-Line and Power of Three, and Deer and Bear as Primeval Mothers.<br /><br />This book is wonderful for textile artists, potters, painters, or poets - indeed for anyone interested in drawing inspiration from the furthest reaches of human history. These are powerful symbols for study, which come alive when given careful attention.eer and Bear as Primeval Mothers.<br /><br />This book is wonderful for textile artists, potters, painters, or poets - indeed for anyone interested in drawing inspiration from the furthest reaches of human history.

This book clearly describes two meditation exercises to improve the flow of chi through the energy circuits in the body.  The first involves sending positive energy to your internal organs and other structures so that they can function better.  The second is the &quot;microcosmic orbit,&quot; a very ancient practice which moves energy in a circular motion up the spine, over the head, down the front of the body, and back up the spine.  At the end of this exercise the chi is then focused in the Tan Tien center, right below the navel.<br />The microcosmic orbit differs from the Hatha Yoga practice of raising the kundalini energy up the spine in that in the Taoist practice you always bring the energy back down, thus grounding it.  Much of the purported danger in these sorts of energy exercises comes from leaving the energy &quot;raised,&quot; which sometimes happens in Hatha Yoga, or so I am told.<br />Thus I don't agree with the warnings that these exercises are dangerous when not practiced with a master.  Although I do have a Tai chi/Chi Kung teacher, I started these exercises years ago when I was working alone.  The most notable change that I have experienced doing the microcosmic orbit is that I have many more lucid dreams than ever before, plus a sense of having a clearer energy field.<br />It is important to note that Chia does not make any reference to Taoist yoga as a religious practice.  You may do these exercises as a Taoist, a Christian, a Buddhist, a Wiccan, whatever.  They are simply exercises to learn about and work with your own life-force energy.<br />If you are working with a teacher, this book is a good adjunct as it has diagrams of the energy pathways and certain internal organs which you should know about.  If you don't yet have a teacher, the book will introduce the subject in a straightforward, simple way that you can easily work with.	2000-09-21

For instance:  &quot;People did not  evolve on Earth, we were brought here from a variety of planetary cultures,  and a number of channelers are now also describing them in their  writings.&quot;  Aside from Stein's metaphysical views, one must also  contend with her anti-male slant.  Curiously, she relies heavily on  Buddhist ideas in her thinking--one wonders how she could be unaware that  organized Buddhism, like the other established world religions, has its own  ways of keeping women in their place, at least in the East.<br />However,  there is a lot of information about Reiki and energy work in this book that  is helpful.  Stein knows a lot about healing, and presents her information  clearly.  She truly wants her readers to succeed at healing. The  information on passing attunements is very good, as is the background on  the various symbols.  Thus I recommend this book, even though I find some  of her ideas to be rather undisciplined.	2000-09-13

Hillman wrote this book in the mid-seventies, and it is surprising to me how little effect it seems to have had on the various schools of dream interpretation. Perhaps this is because Hillman's \\"underworld\\" is an ambiguous, sometimes frightening place, a place where each psyche is rooted into the Beyond, and where daytime morality has no dominion. According to the author, the underworld and its dreams contribute to the making of Soul, and are not to be used as helps to fix up our daytime life. To do so is an act of exploitation. This clearly is at odds with our culture's fixation on mining one's dreams for images, ideas, and information that can help us be more productive and functional players in the status quo world we inhabit during waking hours.<br />Hillman carefully develops his ideas through looking at the work of Freud, Jung, and other twentieth century dream workers. He winnows out the wheat from the chaff, and uses the wheat to thrust dream interpretation forward, and farther away from the safe, cozy realm the ego would so much like to stay wrapped up in. One gets the feeling reading this book that safety does not a strong soul make.<br /><br />Being an inveterate \\"miner\\" of dreams myself, I was at first rather resistant to Hillman's thesis. Eventually, though, I came around to his point of view (with reservations), mainly because I realized that dreams and soulwork are very much like art. Just as art should not always be made for any practical \\"daytime\\" use, so with our souls and dream images.<br /><br />However, this opens a question. For thousands of years, shamans have traveled into the underworld to bring back energy for healing individuals and their communities. They act as conduits for energies traveling up from the Otherworld so that this world can be \\"seeded\\" and keep evolving. Is this, too, an act of exploitation?  I don't think so. But I do think, after reading this book, that we should be aware of, and careful about, how we use the images and teachings that come to us, unbidden, as we sleep.me to us, unbidden, as we sleep.	2000-09-08

Anton the Dove Fancier is a collection of autobiographical short stories about a teenage Jewish boy in Poland during World War II.  The stories are  so well linked together that the book  reads like a novel.  In it we  discover the Nazi occupation and the death camps through the eyes of an  adolescent, which gives this book a different slant compared to much  Holocaust literature.<br />The author, Bernard Gotfryd, shows himself to be a  keen observer of people, as well as of the small, humble details of  everyday life.  He has the gift of being able to illuminate those details,  so that they take on a transcendant beauty. We see a world--one which  others might find dull and ordinary--through the consciousness of a mind  which is itself radiant.  Thus, the stories do not only address the horrors  of the nazi occupation and the camps; those horrors are set against a  backdrop of everyday life and people, the memories of which are  interspersed throughout the book.  This gives it a chiaroscuro quality  which I find to be rare in literature, and through the play of light and  shadow the author creates an ambiguous, complex world.  This ambiguity is  another way in which the book differs from much Holocaust literature.  Many  of the characters themselves are ambiguous, and after reading about them we  find ourselves asking, &quot;Was he good, or bad?&quot;  The answer is  yes.....<br />This book indirectly leads the reader to ponder the issues of  suffering and healing.  Despite the optimistic teachings of the growth  psychology movement, there are wounds which are too traumatic to fully  heal.  Growth psychology would have us believe that without integration,  and psychological &quot;functionality,&quot; we cannot realize our full  potential.  It posits a future goal that we can attain through work on  ourselves. However, Gotfryd shows us, through the power of his words, that  we are most fully human when we can really open our eyes and see the world  in its complexity and irrationality, as well as its simplicity and beauty,  right now.y and irrationality, as well as its simplicity and beauty,  right now.	2000-08-23

Reading interviews with people who use the process every day is a lot  different than reading about creativity in a &quot;how to be creative&quot;  book.  You get more of a sense of the range of ways people produce  outstanding work.  Shekerjian introduces us to people who are not only in  the arts, but also  science, teaching, ecology and conservation, political  science, social services, and other fields.  Many of these people are  extremely quirky, and there's a lesson in that:  trying to be like others,  and be liked, is not the way to uncover your potential.<br />Shekerjian's  prose is conversational and easy to read.  However, at times I found it to  be overly flowery and thus distracting.  There were many involved  descriptions of interview settings, which seemed superfluous.  I found  myself doing a lot of skimming to get to the core subject matter.  On the  whole, though, it's a well-written book, by an author who is clearly in  love with her subject matter.	2000-08-21

First of all let me say that I do believe this author has some good ideas.  His basic strategy is to identify the strongest players in the new economy  (tech stocks), then identify the companies which supply those companies,  then find out who sells to those suppliers, and continue on in that  fashion.  Then you sit down and diagram the companies and their  interrelationships.<br />So, he does know what he's talking about (I  think)--it's just that the way he talks about it is just so damned  annoying.  I would estimate that 30% of the text is just his definitions of  his own pet terms.  Thus we have KVPs (Killer Value Propositions),  &quot;new, order-of-magnitude improvements in the status quo.&quot;  There  are ChangeWaves, FadWaves, SuperSpaces, and WaveRiders.  There are  AfterShocks and Emerging game-over dominators (E.G.O.D.) Since he uses  these terms throughout his discourse, you'd better learn them if you want  to get what's going on.  Personally, I don't have the patience.<br />When I  buy a book, I want to believe in the author.  After all, I've made an  investment.  But this sort of jargon really makes me feel like I'm being  sold a bill of goods.  If I could give the author one piece of advice it  would be to read The Elements of Style by William Strunk.  We had to read  it in middle school so we could learn how to write without making the  reader suffer too much.<br />Some have criticized the book because it's a  blatant advertisement for the author's website.  This is true.  However, I  would like to say that the author's writing is much better in his website  articles.  These articles are available to non-paying visitors.  Also, he  has a lot of other information, good information, on his website which is  offered for free.  Thus, in the balance, I think he has knowledge to offer  and he knows a lot, and he's not a greedy used-car salesman type. But I  suggest you visit the website, where you can sample portions of the book,  before deciding to buy it.y it.	2000-08-19

Capra looks at the life sciences through the lens of systems  theory, and thus provides a very good introduction to systems theory for  those (like me) who are novices.  He also gives an account of life, from  its earliest origins on up to the beginnings of human consciousness,  working with the ideas of the main developers of systems theory over the  past several decades.<br />One of the most intriguing aspects of this theory  (or perhaps I should say set of theories) for me is how it describes and  works out in more detail a basic intuition that many of us have even as  children (and that many spiritual traditions have always recognized): that  all things are connected in a giant web-work (wheels within wheels within  wheels....).  Anyone responding to this intuition knows that no being can  be understood without looking at both the patterns it comprises, as well as  the greater patterns it is a part of.<br />Another provocative aspect of these  theories is how they push the definition of life out farther and farther,  for in many ways all dissapative systems (economies, cultures, hurricanes)  can be seen as having living qualities.<br />I disagree with the criticisms  of the reviewers who complain that this book is derivative and contains too  few original ideas.  The author's intent here was to present a synthesis of  teachings on a subject which is still new to many people, whilst arguing  for a more appreciative and reverent attitude towards the world we live in.  The result is a book which is not only fascinating but inspiring as well.	2000-08-19

There is so much information in this book that it demands at least two  readings.  First, there is a wealth of material on trading.  The chapter on  technical analysis and reading the markets is solid and contains some good  tips I've not found elsewhere.  There is an entire chapter on containing  risk, a large focus of which is money management--this information is worth  the price of the book in itself.<br />Boucher also offers good material on  selecting equities, evaluating other asset classes, and yes, hedge funds.  However, the material on hedge funds does not take up a huge amount of  space, and at first I wondered why he gave the book the title it has.  I  have since concluded that the title reflects his overall strategy, which is  one of limiting risk by spreading ones' investments among many types of  securities and asset classes, both onshore and offshore.<br />Aside from the  above mentioned material, however, Boucher also has a couple of chapters on  basic economics which I found to be invaluable background information for  traders (like me) without business or economic degrees.  His description of  the liquidity cycle is brilliant.  He explains the economic theory of  Austrian alchemy, and shows how that model makes better sense than  Keynesian economics.  He has also provided data to convince me (a social  liberal) that corporate taxes have a negative effect on a nations'  citizenry.<br />This book requires dedication to get through certain sections,  but it is well worth it.  Its strength is its clear elucidation of trading  information and techniques, supported by a foundation of economic theory  and historical data, which enables the reader to understand the context in  which s/he trades.	2000-08-19

In this book author Steven Harrison focuses on an aspect of the &quot;journey&quot; that is hardly ever mentioned in this age of feel-good spirituality--that is, the action of most seekers is one of grasping.  He  suggests that instead of chasing after this or that &quot;experience,&quot;  we work at removing the ego from center-stage.  Once we do that, the  spiritual journey is done, because we  find ourselves already in a highly  spiritual state.<br />I can't disagree with his ideas here, however, he  doesn't really explain well enough (for my purposes) HOW one does the work  of getting the ego to budge from center stage (the book Shadow Dance by  David Richo does deal thoroughly with this topic).  His musings on the  relationship of ego to consciousness and our daily lives are written in a  way which is highly abstract and cerebral.  For instance, &quot;Integration  can communicate with, interact with the projected thought-reality.  It  inherently commnicates because integration includes the space within which  this thought-reality arises.&quot;  OK, the whole book is not written that  densely, but much of it is.  This sort of prose is hard to sink your teeth  into and digest in a way that changes your actions in the world.  I now see  why Jesus spoke in parables and metaphors--he employed simple, concrete  terms, and it was the very simplicity of the images which allowed them to  act as psychic catalysts (&quot;the Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard  seed&quot;).  Harrison does include some little teaching stories in his  book, and I savored them much as I once did an iced cola after driving  across the Mohave desert with no air-conditioning.  Regardless of the  language, however, I think there are some important ideas in this book  which make it worth reading, and I also believe the author has paid the  personal dues necessary to be a teacher.	2000-07-13

This book  takes a gentle, gradual approach, so that the practitioner can avoid some  of the unpleasant side affects of sudden kundalini activation.  I worked  through the exercises as written for several months before branching into a  slightly different meditation form.  During those months I did experience  noticeable changes in my waking perceptions, as well as in my dreams, which  became lucid much more frequently.  I did, however, retain some blockages  in certain chakras which these meditations could not seem to budge.  Thus I  would recommend that for stubborn blockages one work with a teacher,  because the book alone can only take you so far.  Still, it is an excellent  book, written in a very positive and supportive voice.	2000-07-08

The author combines New Age, Buddhist, and some Cherokee teachings into a collage approach that does little justice to either the Buddhist or the Cherokee traditions. Much of the historical data the author gives is clearly revisionist and just plain wrong. The material on crystals is clearly a New Age overlay.<br />We often hear about how New Age authors and musicians rip off Indian cultures in order to sell books and music.

Dr. Northrup begins the book by looking at the feminine &quot;energy body&quot; and chakra system, thus placing the book  squarely in the camp of &quot;mind-body medicine&quot; from the very  beginning.  However, throughout the rest of the book she very skillfully  blends the complementary outlook with allopathic medicine, in a way which  is very reasonable and helpful.  She definitely comes across as someone who  has had rigorous medical training, both in school and later on her own as a  very observant practitioner.  One of the things I found most helpful about  this book was the way she linked womens' emotional states with physical  illnesses.  For instance, womens' chronic low self-esteem and resulting  depression have measurable physical repercussions.  What I did not find so  helpful was her description of our patriarchal system as  &quot;addictive.&quot;  I personally think the terms &quot;addiction&quot;  and &quot;addictive&quot; are way overused right now in our culture, and I  did not understand the connection between patriarchy and addiction.  However, I found so much in this book that empowered me to accept myself as  I am, rather than how the larger culture wants me to look and be, that I  strongly recommend the book to others.	2000-07-03

I've been spinning on and off for a few years now, and I still refer back to Hands On Spinning as my primary source.  This book originally taught me to spin on a spindle, all by myself, with no teacher.  Ms. Raven's instructions allowed me to pick it up quite quickly, and after working a couple of hours with some rough wool, I soon found myself making some very nice silk singles yarn.  Later, I had two hours of instruction on a wheel, and used the book at home to help me through those awkward first hours of wheel spinning.<br /><br />Ms. Raven assumes you know nothing, and provides enough information to cover each topic thoroughly without giving you too much to ponder.  Thus the book  is not too big, but just big enough. She starts you out by having you roll wool on your lap to twist it into a short length of yarn, which is probably how the first threads were made.<br /><br />Then she proceeds into the chapter on spindle spinning, which is clearly written and well organized.  Moving along, she explains the parts of the spinning wheel, what they do, and how to tension them properly.  Her chapter on learning to spin on the wheel is as good a verbal description of how to do this as any I've read.

I found his insights very valuable; although I had read John's gospel many times before, Ravindra's  reading of it pointed out many insights I would never had caught on my own.  I suspect this may be because the author approached the gospel with a  &quot;beginner's mind,&quot; which is often difficult for those of us  raised in a Judaeo-Christian culture.  His perspectives on the story of the  Samaritan woman at the well were so profound that they pushed my  understanding of Jesus' teachings to a new level.  As a person who has  given up on organized religion, this book was valuable in helping me to go  back to what is of value in Christian teachings and draw on it.  Ravindra  combines his understanding of the Hindu approach to the spiritual path with  Christian mysticism in this book.  Rather than watering down either  tradition, the approach is truly inspiring.	2000-07-03

The diet works because it is based on common sense.  The authors have you eating almost no processed, packaged  foods.  Instead you eat (in generous portions if you wish) fruits, veggies,  breads, even some meat and fish (and, in my version of the diet, a few  cookies here and there).  There are some rules you need to follow for  success which are based on the body's metabolic cycle.  For instance, you  take only fruits or fruit juices before noon, and you do not eat within  three hours of bedtime.  The authors give detailed explanations for the  theory behind the practices they advocate.  Many of the explanations made  sense to me, but others sounded rather off-the-wall.  No matter--the diet  works, no matter what the explanations.  This is healthy eating meant for  the rest of your life, not just until you drop your excess weight.  It will  get you looking slimmer and having a lot more energy--without being hungry  all the time.	2000-06-29

The problem with it, though, was that it was written from a male perspective. With The Heroine's Journey I am now at the end of my search for a book on the hero archetype from a feminine perspective. Although this book is not exactly Jungian in its approach, the author clearly seems to have been influenced by Jung's legacy of searching for mythic themes in our individual psyches. Thus, she writes of the archetype of the Journey, and all its symbolism, as it applies to the feminine psyche. But she goes beyond that and explores some of the modern social issues that have been quite troubling for many women.<br /><br /> For instance, in the chapter &quot;The Illusory Boon of Success,&quot; she touches upon how many of us, in striving to fulfill our dream of making an impact on the world, often end up buying into aspects of the male-dominated business culture that don't really benefit us as women. She then describes the process of building into our work and personal lives values that do benefit us, as well as others. Her chapter on &quot;Initiation and Descent to the Goddess&quot; is very helpful in showing how we can use loss and grief to become more strong and whole. There are so many issues and themes explored in this book that it really demands at least a couple of readings. This book has given me so much to think about, and has helped me clarify my thoughts on many different issues pertaining to myself as a woman and as a spiritual being--I am very grateful to Maureen Murdock for writing it.	2000-06-29

This is one of the best books I have read on learning to access the wisdom we all carry within us.  Although I have used workbook formats in the past that did not really inspire me, this one really did draw me into  interacting with the author's ideas via the text.  The format works well  for learning intuition, since you work through the techniques chapter by  chapter, rather than simply read about them.  The book is very  well-organized.  It starts out discussing just what intuition is and how  using your intuition can help you.  It then proceeds to teach how to work  with your inner self, both for practical problem solving and for spiritual  growth.  Chapter headings include Centering, Receptivity, Interpreting  Images from the Intuitive Mind, and Achieving Mental Clarity.  There are  sections on working with your dreams, meditation, and using intuition to  succeed in the workplace.  This listing only scratches the surface of what  the book offers however.  The author has included, in addition to a very  complete text, an end section with reading suggestions and additional  resources.  I have used the book for a number of years now, and every time  I come back to it I gain something new.  I highly recommend it.	2000-06-28

In this book Gary Zukov teaches unconditional love as the path to higher consciousness, and very few people I know will argue with that.  However, his tone undercuts the message.  It is preachy, supercilious, and  holier-than-thou.  He makes very pat statements about the \\"truth\\"  using very abstract language and giving us no evidence to support what he  is saying.  Such evidence would go a long way toward helping us swallow his  points--even if it were only the evidence of personal spiritual experiences  from his own past.<br /><br />As an example of one of his explanations of \\"how  things are,\\" he writes about the extinction of the dolphins thus:  \\"The dolphin soul is leaving the Earth, that is, the dolphin species  is becoming extinct.  The dolphins are beaching themselves.  They are  creating diseases within themselves.  This is their way of refusing to  continue to live upon the Earth.  They feel that they cannot fulfill the  purpose for which they are born.  Therefore, they are leaving.  Their  deaths are not suicides because they are not frightened.  They are  exhausted.\\"  What's wrong with the idea that it is actually humans  killing dolphins off?  What's wrong with that idea, according to this book,  is that bad things only happen to you for two reasons:  a) your own bad  karma, and b) your own free choice as a soul.  Well, I guess that lets our  species off the hook as far as the cetaceans are concerned.<br /><br />Zukov also  devalues the Shadow, a powerful and necessary component of the human  psyche.  He seems to think that we can transcend the Shadow by a)paying off  our karmic debts and b)willing ourselves to transcend it. His theory of  karma is quite Newtonian, all organized, logical, and reductionist.  The  clockwork-like ambience of the universe he creates in these pages comes  across as rather sinister to me.  There is no joy here, just inexorable  cause and effect, grinding the soul's face into the sand like a series of  waves pounding a swimmer over and over.  Zukov clearly does not feel  comfortable with mystery or ambiguity.<br /><br />This book makes the mistake of many New Age books:  purporting to be about the \\"new paradigm\\" and \\"holism,\\" it instead dresses up old Modernist ideas in New Age/postmodernist dress.  The end result is more dogma, just of a different sort than what we get in church.Zukov clearly does not feel  comfortable with mystery or ambiguity.

A few years ago I went to a spiritually oriented week-long conference where there were a lot of New Age ideas being discussed and taught. I was open to some of these ideas, but what struck me as odd were the teachers themselves. Very few seemed to have learned the art of critical thinking, but no matter--their lack of intellectual depth was clearly compensated for by the strength of their belief in their special calling and powers.<br />I wondered about the evolution of these so-called \\"spiritual teachers\\" and their teachings, and I believe I have found in this book a good portion of what I wondered about. Peter Washington delves into the beliefs of the Theosophists, many of which ideas are quite similar to some of the current New Age ideas (such as the teaching of the Ascended Masters). He presents evidence that most of these ideas were made up by Madame Blavatsky herself. After being propounded by Madame, they were eagerly gobbled up by a large number of credulous followers. These followers were so taken with their new spiritual leaders that they refused to believe any evidence that they were being duped by tactics such as staged seances or missives from the Masters materialized out of thin air. They even held their tongues when it came out that those leaders were practicing child abuse. This book is not just a study in the power grabbing that often goes on among professional spiritual teachers, it also digs into the willingness of seekers to turn over their power to these teachers. In that sense it is a rather painful, sad study of human nature, yet written in a way that is sarcastic, and at times wickedly witty. I recommend this book to any reader who considers him/herself to be on a spiritual path, as there are many valuable lessons in it.	2000-06-17

This book is an introduction to business applications of certain mathematical techniques.  The author focuses on data analysis, which allows you to use collected data to predict trends and formulate business plans.  He wrote the book for people with not-so-strong math backgrounds, and I  think he succeeded in making the book understandable for such people.  (I  gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 only because there were a couple of  explanations which were not clear to me--however, I fully admit that the  problem could lie with me rather than the author in these instances.)  Topics covered include statistics, spreadsheets, neural networks (a very  good chapter), how to use databases, and basic logic.  The tone of the book  is conversational and the author does a good job of presenting dry  information in a manner which is non-threatening and friendly.  I recommend  this book to those who want to learn to use math as a tool to improve  managerial performance.	2000-06-14

In his book &quot;Cosmic Consciousness,&quot; published in 1901, Richard Bucke writes of &quot;certain men who...are either exalted, by the average self conscious individual, to the rank of gods, or, adopting the other extreme, are adjudged insane.&quot; This is the earliest mention I have found of the potential problem inherent in the spiritual growth process: bouts of madness, or at least extreme dysfunction. The Grofs have put together a collection of essays by themselves and various other authors which explore the psychic/psychological dynamics of what they call &quot;spiritual emergency.&quot; That's their term for when the growth process puts a person into psychic overload. The essays describe different aspects of such overload, as well as ways to help someone (or oneself) through it.<br /><br /> A repeating theme throughout the book is that too often such people are pathologized and medicated by well-meaning but materialistic-minded health care workers. This not only terminates the process so that breakthrough cannot occur, it can also drive the patient into permanent madness. Some of the contributors to this book include Roberto Assagioli, John Weir Perry, Ram Dass, Lee Sannella, Holger Kalweit, and others. There is a fascinating piece by Keith Thompson entitled &quot;The UFO Encounter Experience as a Crisis of Transformation,&quot; which is the most profound way of looking at UFO abduction phenomenon that I've ever read. I recommend this book to anyone interested in personal growth--it is interesting, well-edited, and filled with a lot of useful information.	2000-06-11

The verbal descriptions that go with the  photos are clear.  In addition, newer students will find the  Korean/English, English/Korean glossary of terms helpful.  The author has  also included a brief (too brief) history of Tang Soo Do and a lineage  chart, but for me these are not the strong points of the book.  Also, I  would have liked to see a little more about the philosophy behind this  martial art; however, the photographic explanations of the moves make the  book well worth the price.	2000-06-02

He structures his analyses around the concept of the business cycle, the recurring boom and bust loop  which the economy has gone through over the past two centuries.  Showing  how the four major sectors (as well as other economic factors) interact in  feedback loops to drive the business cycle, he gives us the information we  need to see what stage of the cycle we're currently experiencing and where  we're headed.  Knowing this we can better decide where to park our assets  in the short and medium-term future.  His outline of the various stages of  the business cycle is very helpful, even though it's a rough guide.  For  instance, although gold does not seem to have played its assigned role in  this scheme, it is clear that commodities did bottom in the third quarter  of last year, signaling that a market top would follow in the  not-too-distant future.  Thus, even though the stock market is a dynamic  system and cannot be exactly predicted, there are patterns that take a huge  amount of guesswork out of charting one's way through it.  This book  thoroughly explores those patterns and provides the investor/trader a solid  support for making financial decisions.	2000-05-23

It has answers to almost all the questions you will ever have about why your rabbit acts the way it does.  The author puts  problem behaviors like biting in perspective, explaining the natural  impulses behind them and providing ways to guide your rabbit out of them.  Because our domestic rabbits have been bred mainly for appearance rather  than for behavioral traits, they are still very close to their wild  brethren in their behavioral habits.  Thus, the author spends quite a bit  of time exploring how rabbits live in the wild, and then shows how these  behaviors carry forward into the domestic situation.  This is a valuable  work, as it is currently difficult to find information in print on wild  rabbit behavior.	2000-05-21

Through exhaustive interviews with these doctors, people who knew them, and  camp survivors, Lifton arrives at more than just individual psychological  profiles of these professional killers.  He presents us rather with a  dense, psychosocial exploration of the dynamics of state-organized terror,  along with  enough history to describe the milieu in which these dynamics  evolved.  (Many people will be surprised to discover that the eugenics  movement, which fueled the Nazi terror, had a large following in the United  States during the 1930's.)<br /><br />The book reads like a novel in parts (especially  the chapter on Josef Mengele).  However, I found the introduction one of the  most interesting sections; in it Lifton describes the process he went  through to gather and analyze his data.  This included interviewing ex-Nazi doctors, who suspected or knew outright that Lifton himself is Jewish.  Lifton's descriptions of the verbal dances he and these doctors did  around the German/Jewish conflict are fascinating.....For obvious reasons  this book is  not an \\"easy read,\\" despite the quality of the  writing.  It will literally give you bad dreams.  But it serves to instruct us about demons which still inhabit the collective human psyche, demons which we fail to acknowledge only at our peril.  For this reason, if no other, it demands our attention.	2000-05-10

The author is a psychologist, as well as a philosopher specializing in phenomenology.  His thinking definitely serves as a solid underpinning to this book.  However, the book is completely practical.  It teaches you how to get in  touch with your body/mind--the part of you that feels and knows without  using logic, morality, guilt, or blame.  Once you get in touch with  whatever your body/mind is experiencing in the present, you focus on that  &quot;felt sense.&quot;  Keeping your conscious awareness tuned to that  feeling causes a movement in the energy, and ultimately a shift  occurs,which you can physically feel as a release of a blockage or a point  of tension.  This technique works very well for those problems and issues  that you thought you had worked through, but keep returning over and over  again.  The best part is, you can do this work without a therapist.  After  a while, you will find that your body (or rather, body/mind) becomes your  best teacher on all matters of the heart and soul.	2000-04-24

He wrote the book in the sixties, when the Gestalt theory of perception was very much in vogue.  His view of truly creative perception, however, is very different from the Gestalt view.  He maintains that Gestalt perception is analytic in nature, since part of Gestalt theory focuses on how we separate a figure from its background in order to give meaning to what we see.  Accordingly, it demands a certain maturity in the human brain's development, and only begins to be used by children around the age of eight.<br /><br />Citing research papers on development and perception, Ehrenzweig argues that younger children and artists use what he terms \\"undifferentiated perception\\" in perceiving the world--this form of perception is holistic and non-hierarchical.  It makes no distinction between figure and ground, or between main subject and minor subject.  He believes that on an unconscious level, we are all continuously scanning the environment in this way.  However, only small children and some adults are open to the information thus gained.<br /><br />One example he uses of how an adult uses non-differentiated perception is a chess master who is able to plot several moves ahead.  Since each potential move has several possible subsequent moves, the permutations of possibilities inherent in a few moves ahead are truly daunting, and the use of one's analytic ability to evaluate them all would require more time than is available.  Ehrenzweig maintains that the chess master does not evaluate a series of moves in an analytical manner, but rather uses non-differentiated perception, which allows many more computations to be carried out on a subconscious level.<br /><br />His arguments are compelling, and after cultivating undifferentiated perception myself, and raising young children who did seem to use it quite naturally, I was convinced that he was on to something. I've had this book since 1988 and still refer to it when I'm thinking or writing about issues in perception, creativity, or consciousness. However, there does not seem to have been much written about this topic in the scientific journals in the years since the book was published.  Not being trained in psychology or perception, I cannot comment on why this is so.  Nevertheless, the book has changed the way that I experience and think about my own mind. Moreover, it has helped me greatly in my creative projects, as well as in picking up information from the environment that later turns out to be quite useful.1988 and still refer to it when I'm thinking or writing about issues in perception, creativity, or consciousness.

I decided to learn lace knitting after never having done any other sort of knitting before.  If this had been my first book on the subject, I would have saved myself a lot of time and frustration.  I've been working from it for a couple of months now and it all makes sense to me.  To use it you  should know how to cast on and off, how to knit and purl, and how to do a  yarn over;she will explain the rest.  The diagrams of the basic stitches  used are in the back and are quite clear.  The book, which is beautifully  designed, is divided into two sections.  In the first, the author shows you  how to knit, section by section, a reproduction of a historical knitted  lace sampler.  The stitches vary from simple ones with a few rows per  design motif to quite complex ones with motifs composed of many rows.  The  second section explains the theory behind pattern construction.  It is very  clear and well organized.  The author explains things such as why certain  stitches work well together, how to build patterns out of combinations of  other patterns, and how to make your own charts.  In other words, it  teaches you how to free yourself of pattern books.  The given patterns,  however, are very fun and beautiful to knit.  I highly recommend this work  to experienced knitters and beginners alike.	2000-03-20

Although I personally would not  pick a stock only on the basis of its chart, I must allow that charts help  us pick good entry and exit points, and provide other pertinent information  as well.  One of my favorite investment authors, John Murphy, has an entire  book on technical analysis.  I regard him as a scholar and a very astute  thinker who would never dabble in snake oil.....with resources like  Murphy's books out there I can't understand TMF's cavalier dismissal of the  entire field.  They similarly denigrate the entire field of options and  futures, which I think perhaps shows a lack of understanding on their part.  Aside from these criticisms, however, I recommend this book as a very good  primer on how to evaluate a company you are thinking about investing in.	2000-02-23

There is an introduction, and three meditations following.  The first meditation walks your awareness through the entire body, so that you can learn to be more  aware of yourself as a physical being.The second tape is a similar  meditation focusing on the pelvic region.  Third,there is a loving-kindness  meditation, to help you connect with all beings in need of healing, and to  share your healing energy with them.  I liked how Levine included this  part, because it makes us aware we are not isolated in our suffering.  The  only problem with the tapes is that they are narrated by him, and he is a  man with a man's voice.  This is especially disconcerting when doing the  second meditation.  He mentions this issue in the introduction, and says  that you can make your own tape in your own voice or a friend's.  The tapes  come with a transcript so you can indeed easily make your own tapes in a  safe voice.  However, I think it might have been better if in the first  place he had had his wife and working partner Ondrea read the text on the  tapes.  Still, his heart is in the right place and I did find the tapes  helpful.	1999-11-29

It outlines the hidden assumptions, as well as the explicit scientific philosophies, behind the academic world's disrespect and irreverence for animals. Because it analyzes and weighs ideas, it is not an easy read in many sections--thus, I think, the number of reviews which gave it 1 or 2 stars. Like some readers, I thought there would be a lot more anecdotes in the book, and yet, I learned a lot more about the flaws in how we think about animals from the authors' discussions about human viewpoints.<br /><br /> Be prepared to put on your thinking cap when you sit down with this book--although there are entertaining vignettes, that's not the main point. Also, the reader(s) who were incensed about the authors' &quot;attack&quot; on scientific method did not closely read the text, I believe. The authors' arguments were based on voluminous research and are in line with many dissenting scientists' viewpoints. I find that there are many folks who believe in reductionist science so strongly that it becomes almost a religion for them--and when their &quot;religion&quot; is &quot;attacked&quot;, they simply ignore the evidence on the other side whilst saying the opposing views are bogus. The authors should probably take it as a positive sign that they have triggered this sort of outrage. This book is aimed at minds willing to work, rather than be spoonfed. If you want an easy read, buy &quot;Ring of Bright Water&quot; or something along those lines.	1999-10-29

It's not politically correct like much childrens' literature today--and that's its charm.  The children are  not naughty, but they certainly get themselves into a pickle with the Id-like cat who cheerfully enters their home and wreakes havoc while their  mother is out for the afternoon.  Would that the Id were always so congenial!  The house gets wrecked, but the  cat can clean up as fast as he can make a mess, and by the time mom gets  home, everything's back to normal.  The last line in the book is best of  all:  \\"What would you do if your mother asked you?\\"  No  moralizing here--just a simple question.  This is children's literature with a capital L....buy it for your kids, buy it for yourself if you're \\"all growed up.\\"	1999-10-25

It is one of the most liberating books I have ever read.  As an adult survivor of child  abuse, I was in therapy for over 16 years and never felt that mainstream  psychologists have any idea of just how powerful our soul's nature is.  A  system of healing which leaves out our spiritual energies-- and our ability  to transform our realities into the stuff of myth--is an impotent system,  at least if you are someone whose roots run very deep.  I made little  progress in my own healing until I began working on the spiritual and soul  aspects of my life.  Hillman writes that we are not as shaped by the  horrors of our early upbringing as we are told by psychotherapists.  What  an inspiration for transcending the past!  Unlike authors such as Carolyn  Myss, he offers this teaching in a way that does not blame people for their  anger about the past.  He simply offers a way beyond the anger and other  self-imposed limits, cheerfully and graciously.  The detractors of this  book state that it is not scientific enough.  Of course it is not  scientific--it's about bringing the energies of the invisible into your  life.  You don't have to do reductionist studies of the principles involved  to have them change your way of thinking about yourself...  I recommend  this book to anyone who is tired of the dry, sterile approach to healing  offered by professional counselors who have not themselves explored the  &quot;realms beyond&quot; and therefore cannot teach us how to experience  them for our benefit.	1999-10-21

I tried a couple of on-line tutorials, as well as a couple of books, and only ended up confused.  This author assumes you know nothing and starts you out from  scratch.  I understand every sentence; it's also well-written enough that  it's interesting.  I'm now inspired to go on from here, perhaps with  Nisan's Candlestick Charting and Beyond Candlesticks.  I highly recommend  this book.	1999-10-20

I am not even a musician, I'm a visual artist, but everything in here can be applied to any  discipline one pursues--even business or science, or daily living itself.  The chapters are short, but to really internalize them and put them into  practice takes time and conscious effort.  Thus it's not a book to read  through once and then set aside, but rather to digest slowly through many  readings......I love this book.	1999-09-15

Whitmont, who was born in the early part of the century, is (if he's still alive) an M.D. and psychotherapist, and also well versed in homeopathy, alchemy, chaos theory, the theories of Rupert Sheldrake and David Bohm, and many other topics such as art, literature, and drama. He has a truly broad intellect as well as a highly developed intuitive sense. I would say his ideas are firmly within the humanist tradition, without any New Age leanings. Indeed, he shows that in healing, darkness is just as important as &quot;the Light&quot;--for the darkness is where one goes to mine the gold of the deepest human experiences. He does not approach the causes of illness from the standpoint so prevalent today of &quot;we cause our illnesses by not dealing with our emotional or soul issues.&quot;<br /><br /> Rather, he points out that illness, as well as all phenomena, proceeds from a deeper level of reality whose patterns are not readily discernible or understandable when viewed from the three dimensional reality we inhabit. Although I cannot summarize the book well because it contains so much, I would say that his basic stance is that everything of the visible world is rooted in an invisible reality, an &quot;implicate order,&quot; (to quote physicist David Bohm) and that in healing we must take that implicate order into consideration just as much as we do the physical reality of the illness. His way of doing this takes up a good part of the second portion of the book. (The first portion explains his way of looking at man, reality, and the universe, with an interesting first chapter on homeopathy.)<br /><br /> I highly recommend this book to any healer, whether you are a nurse, physician, psychotherapist, energy healer, somatics practitioner, whatever.........it's not necessarily an easy read but it will open up many dimensions of the healing process to you.of the healing process to you.	1999-09-05

It is valuable for people first starting out on their transformative journey, but also contains enough information to interest those who've been on the path a while.  The  title of the introduction is &quot;From Caterpillar to Butterfly,&quot; and  that states the theme of the book--how we transform.  The phases we move  through during transformation follow a general sequence, although this is  not a linear, predictable process.  The author has arranged the chapters to  reflect the general ordering of the stages of growth; thus one can see that  there really is a pattern to what may seem at times random and pointless.  This is helpful because the transformation process can be difficult, even  scary at times--this book provides much wisdom and information for  understanding and moving through both the good and the difficult times.  It  has an extensive bibliography and notes which provide good suggestions for  further learning.  This book is written from the perspective of  transpersonal psychology and there is much in here about consciousness and  how it develops.  Although the author obviously has very high standards for  scholarship and intellectual inquiry, the book is enjoyable and  entertaining to read.  I highly recommend it.	1999-09-05

She provides the experimental  evidence that explains how images we hold in our minds really do effect  changes on the physical level--it has to do with how the  &quot;imaging&quot; part of the brain connects to brain structures which  regulate hormones and the immune system.  There is also a fascinating  section on the wise-women healers of Europe and how they were persecuted  for practicing medicine which went against established medical practice as  well as against the Church. It seems the ancient healers were on to  something that became suppressed, and which is now being rediscovered by  scholars as well as healing practitioners.......The author is professor of  psychology at the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology.  Thus, she knows  well how to use reductionist scientific methods as a tool while still  seeing the possibilities lying beyond reductionism in the transpersonal  plane.	1999-09-05

Carolyn Myss writes about health and illness within the individual human energy system, but dosen't take energy thinking far enough--that's why some of her arguments break down. Her basic thesis is that we bring illness on ourselves by neglecting to deal with soul or emotional issues, that is, by not leading an \\"authentic\\" life.  Clearly this can be true, for instance in certain forms of cancer or heart disease.<br />But when thinking about any sort of system, human or otherwise,  you must consider the smaller energy systems which compose it, as well as the larger systems in which it is embedded. Each system \\"level\\" has its own sort of consciousness and imperatives to follow. The \\"level\\" at which our conscious egos work is only one piece of the complex puzzle of reality which composes and enfolds us.<br />Thus, from a systems perspective, disease can follow dysfunction on ANY level, from the cellular to the social or environmental (and maybe even the galactic). One example would be cancers caused by pesticides--here, the human collective's disrespect for the planetary environment results in the illness of individuals. There need not be a particular biographical factor in the genesis of such a cancer, for as  individuals we are all subject to consequences following our collective actions.<br />Similarly, disease can spring from breakdowns on the cellular level of biological systems--thus, plants and animals fall prey to illness in the wild (as they also do from human-caused habitat destruction and pollution). Would Myss say that these non-human creatures were responsible for their illnesses because they did not do their soul or emotional work?<br />To say that biography is the only (or principal) factor in illness is taking a one-dimensional view of disease and the systems it disrupts. Things are more complicated than that. Yes, in much of our life we do have a choice and do indeed create our realities.  But there are other things that come to us unbidden:  floods, tornados, accidents, and yes, disease.  To imply that we create that suffering to me seems uncompassionate.  It is also a form of arrogance--assuming that we can control everything that comes to us in life.<br />Furthermore, there is the question of people who are born with congenital illnesses.  Myss, who believes that before we are born, we enter into a contract about what life challenges to take on, would probably say that such people choose the challenge of such illnesses as part of their pre-birth \\"contract.\\"  But I think that many people with such illnesses would find that hypothesis offensive.<br />Myss also oversimplifies in her comparison of the Christian sacraments, the Hindu chakra system, and the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. These ways of seeing the human spirit-path are similar only on the surface--it would take years of study and personal practice of each of these traditions to understand each one, much less to undertake a \\"compare and contrast\\" exercise. Yes, there is a \\"perennial philosophy\\" that underlies the world religions, but there are also many fundamental differences as well.<br />Focussing on the chakras and the human energy system is indeed a start for understanding the energetics of human disease.  But for an even more in-depth understanding of energy healing I would recommend reading some of the  books out on systems thinking, especially as it pertains to biology. Also, any books which explore sub-systems within the human psyche (depth psychology) pertain to this field, as any ego-self wishing to heal will have to do business with the \\"others\\" which exist within and which have their own energies and axes to grind.tornados, accidents, and yes, disease.

There are no pat answers and easily carried out suggestions in this book--for that reason, it is not what I'd call a New Age book, although it  deals with a New Age topic--the spiritual transformation of individuals and  groups toward what some call the &quot;Christ consciousness,&quot; the  dimension of unconditional love.  The author is comfortable with ambiguity,  with not knowing all the answers, with not providing a complete roadmap  through this often disruptive and frightening process of transformation.  He writes as an expert--what he teaches I believe he has experienced  himself on a very deep level.  This book is for anyone interested in  transformation, mystery, ambiguity, and in being challenged to give up the  ego's most comfortable and defensive habits.  I've read it a few times, and  each time I get more out of it than the last.	1999-06-06
