Foldable and laminated, the map covers the nation's highway system with great detail, and provides the reader with insert maps of the tourist centers of both Santo Domingo and Puerto Plata.<br />Regarding what other reviews for this map might say, I feel that the publishers did the right thing in covering the country's two major tourist centers, because hardly anyone travels to towns such as Higuey, San Pedro de Marcorix, or Santiago de los Caballeros. These cities are mainly second-tier, residential cities and do not have large scale tourist resorts/hotels such as Punta Cana, Sosua, and Puerto Plata.<br />Overall, a great, durable map to have for any future journeys to this interesting country.	2003-07-12

Whether elected or selected, George W. Bush has provided the media with countless and usually non-understandable babble ever since he took the campaign trail over 3 years ago. The Connecticut-born, Texas raised politician is notorious for slaughtering the English language...I only wish that there was a way that I could buy stock in Texas' Department of Education to prevent future generations of Texans from speaking like they were speaking jive. <br />\\"George W. Bushisms: The Slate Book of The Accidental Wit and Wisdom of our 43rd President\\" is a great book for many reasons. First, Gerald Ford must be smiling now that he will not be remembered as America's dumbest president. Second, we now know that Bush doesn't write his speeches (by reading some of Bush's quotations it almost feels that he has invented a new Haiku-style form when it comes to dispensing wisdom, something he truly lacks). Third, it just provides the reader with hours of hysterical fun knowing that the future of Republican Party lies in the hands of this simpleton. <br />The President's grammar skils are not that great but this book surely is. Whether you're a fan or foe of \\"W,\\" \\"Bushisms\\" is a great, hilarious book to read. It might help change many minds when voting on Election Day 2004.	2002-11-21

As a native New Yorker, I heard of many islands that occupied the waters that surround the five boroughs of the city. As I flew back into LaGuardia and JFK airports I even began to notice them from above. Obtaining information about these islands was very difficult, even from local libraries, and therefore when I found this book at a local bookstore, I was delighted that someone came up with the idea of publishing such a book. <br />From Roosevelt Island to Cuban Ledge, the authors give a very thorough and well researched book on the many islands inhabiting the New York archipelago. Many islands which were once islands, but have long since been connected to the boroughs by artificial landfills are also covered here (e.g. Coney Island-Brooklyn, Hunter Island-Bronx, Battery Park area-Manhattan, etc..) are also covered here. <br />If you live in the city or plan on visiting, please make sure to pick up a copy of this guide, and make sure to visit the many hidden treasures found in this city.It makes an excellent companion book while aboard a plane or even in the subway.	2002-11-15

Providing the reader with loads of boring, pity-generating hogwash is what Linda Chavez has accomplished with the publication of this book that discusses her rise in politics and her fall from grace. Chavez, once a bonafide liberal, became a conservative when it became convenient for her. Joining the Republican Party and changing her views on many issues that not only affect her community (Hispanics/Latinos), Chavez manages to sugar coat the realities of a life gone sour.<br />With such discussions as her controversial conversion to Judaism (she later reconverted to Catholicism for political purposes) to her failed campaign to win a U.S. Senate seat in her home state of Maryland, Chavez not only gives us the facts about her family and her evolution from liberalism to conservatism, but also the controversial scandal that led her to decline a nomination on President George W. Bush's incoming cabinet in 2001. Her failure to pay Social Security taxes for a house maid from El Salvador not only brought her unfortunate media scrutiny, it has given her the impression she is the most hated Hispanic in America (I am sorry, but that honor goes to Geraldo Rivera).<br />If Ms. Chavez was not operating her household under a penny-pinching agenda, then she would probably not have written this book and would be promoting her bland and boring ideas that has never gone anywhere. Pity has become Ms. Chavez's newest savior, but unless the reader is an ignoramus, then you will get the point that this book was meant to clean a spill that not even Alice from the Brady Bunch could clean. <br />A failed attempt to paint herself as a goody-goody two shoes who has been supposedly slandered by her political foes, \\"An Unlikely Conservative: The Transformation of an Ex-Liberal [Or How I Became the Most Hated Hispanic in America]\\" is one of the best unintentionally funny books to come out in the past year (the other is Ann Coulter's \\"Slander\\"). Maybe by watching reruns of \\"I Married Dora\\" will Ms. Chavez realize that all her woes are the result of one person: herself. Overall, this is a book I recommend skipping.	2002-11-15

Somewhat a cross between John Waters and Gus Van Sant, Pedro's films have won acclaim throughout the world, especially at major film festivals such as Cannes and Venice. <br />&quot;Desire Unlimited&quot; by Paul Julian Smith covers all of Almodovar's films from his first major film &quot;Pepi, Luci, Bom, y Otras Chicas del Monton&quot; to his Academy-Award winning film, &quot;Todo Sobre Mi Madre.&quot; Summarizing each film in its' own chapter, Smith gives the reader a summary of the plot and commentary on the film's characters, storyline, and locations to further educate readers more about Almodovar's methods. Smith does a great job in discussing each film, especially due to his citations of commentary and critiques from various periodicals throughout the world. <br />Beautifully designed, this book is not only a treat to Almodovar fans worldwide, but also it is a must have for any serious film student/buff who wants to know the forces of creativity from a non-American director. While American directors are often subjected to edits and story rewrites due to big studio contracts and concerns, Almodovar and his film company, El Deseo, do not have to answer to anyone, giving him total control over his films. <br />Truly a genius, Almodovar gets the respect he deserves in this book. I highly recommend this book to all who love Almodovar's unique, campy style. It makes great reading any day of the year.	2002-06-06

Being the inspiration for future generations of cartoonists, Avery brought us such funny characters as Droopy, Spike the bulldog, Screwy Squirrel, and several Looney Tunes characters.<br />This book, originally published by the now defunct publishing branch of Turner Enterprises (now part of AOL-Time Warner) is an excellent tribute to the man who gave the cartoon world new ways to express comedy and feelings. From exploding cigars to eyeballs that pop out of their sockets, Avery gave many comedians and animators inspiration (the film &quot;The Mask,&quot; with Jim Carrey and his facial expressions are a great example of this). <br />Most of the cartoons in this book are now owned by Ted Turner (president and CEO of Turner Enterprises, and now one of the executives at AOL-Time Warner) and Turner's preservation of Avery's works will give future generations access to some of the most wackiest cartoons ever made. Overall, an excellent book with beautiful animation cels and a wonderful history of Avery's life and contributions.	2002-06-02

Known for his hilarious, controversial standup comedy, Saturday Night Live alum and major Hollywood star Chris Rock takes his hard-core comedy to the pages of this hysterical, no-holds barred book. In \\"Rock This,\\" Rock writes about many things that modern society has to face or experienced, including the question of whether to allow gays in the military, Bill Clinton's sexual scandals, and OJ Simpson (in the case of the latter, Rock goes off on Simpson and his obvious guilt in the murder of his ex-wife, which is a change in the overall opinion most African-Americans have on that controversial case).  Using incredible wit, sarcasm, and hilarious imagery, \\"Rock This\\" won me over instantly. This is the first humor book since Howard Stern's \\"Private Parts\\" that captured my attention all the way, and just like Stern, Rock shows that he doesn't really care how people react when speaking his mind or just poking fun of stereotypes.<br />As one of only a handful of Saturday Night Live alums to actually have written a book (others include Steve Martin and Julia Sweeney), Rock definitely captivates his reading audience by just being his crazy, funny, and wild self. In the same tradition as his award-winning HBO series, \\"The Chris Rock Show,\\" (also available on Amazon for purchase) Rock shows that he truly has inherited the throne as the King of African-American Comedy that Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy once held. <BR>\\"Rock This\\" is one of the best books I have read in such a long time. If you are looking for a good laugh, purchase this book. You won't be disappointed at all!	2002-05-07

Other dictionaries don't take the time and organization in clearly stating where each word is used in the Portuguese-speaking world, and unless you're well known with Lusitanian and Brazilian norms, then not including this classification will make it more difficult when learning or using the language. <br />If you need the best Portuguese-English dictionary on the market, then you have found it!

While many try to avoid looking like tourists by pulling out maps or travel books out of their bags or pockets, sometimes it is necessary to have a compact-sized dictionary on hand when their is a communication problem. <br />The &quot;Catalan-English/Catalan Dictionary&quot; by M.S. Sabater and J.A. Freixnet is the perfect solution when traveling throughout Spain's autonomous Catalonia region. Fiercely independent from Madrid, Catalans have taken great pride in promoting use of their language ever since the end of the Franco regime that prohibited the use of Catalan in public. Taught privately in homes, Catalan was able to survive and now is seeing a resurgence in popularity and commercial use as more and more tourists arrive in eastern Spain. The language, spoken mainly in eastern Spain, southeastern France, Andorra (its' official language) and in Italy (on the island of Sardinia), this dictionary is helpful for those who already have a knowledge of how to pronounce words in Catalan. I bought two copies of the book, and sent one to a friend of mine in Terrassa, and he has told me it has been one of the greatest gifts anyone has given him, since most Catalan dictionaries sold in Spain are large and bulky. Hippocrene Press, a publisher of many foreign-language books did a great job in producing a small dictionary for Catalan speakers, however the lack of a pronunciation guide is the only negative thing about this book. As a fluent Spanish speaker I try to avoid pronouncing words in Spanish because I want to respectful to the Catalan culture, but it can be difficult not to.<br />Regardless of this omission, this is a great book to have if you're walking through the streets of Barcelona, sunning yourself on Ibiza, shopping Andorra's duty-free markets, or just to understand general street signs and billboards throughout Catalonia. Instead of looking like a tourist, if you were to pull this book out in Barcelona, you are likely to win the admiration and respect of Catalonia's proud inhabitants.	2002-04-09

The island, which has some the Caribbean's most beautiful beaches and friendliest people has seen tough economic times due to the unjust economic embargo placed by the United States after the Cuban Revolution of 1959.<br />The &quot;Insight Guide to Cuba&quot; is a beautiful, informative guide to this island nation. As an American planning on visiting the island in the future (it is not illegal to visit Cuba for Americans; U.S. law prohibits Americans from spending money there) I wanted to have an idea on how the island appeared like in photographs, and read more about the history of its' people, cities, towns, and sites. This book perfectly captures the island's spirit in beautiful color photographs and well-researched articles that cover everything about the island. Although it is not resourceful when it comes to resourceful information such as emergency numbers, addresses, etc., ... like a Lonely Planet guide, this guide is a must have for anyone who appreciates the island's beauty in photographs.<br />Handy, well researched and compiled, the &quot;Insight Guide to Cuba&quot; rates a ten in my travel book collection.

For many bodybuilding and fitness novices, learning the proper form or way to lift, pull, or push bars, pulleys, or other gadgets that are commonly found on a gym floor can be a task itself.

Using photographs, and easy-to-read type, the book surpasses many professionally written books by top name fitness gurus because. In plain English, this book is similar to a \\"Dummies\\" or \\"Complete Idiot's\\" guide to weight-resistance exercises. Although I am much more of a pro when it comes to training, this book was helpful in helping me learn several exercises that I was not performing correctly. Overall, the book's design, setup, and price are all added pluses when it came to me in purchasing it.<br />So, if you're looking for a simple, yet thorough book on weight training, this book is the right choice.	2002-01-26

Although the idea is great, \\"New York City Ghost Stories\\" fails to capture the reader's attention due to a poorly designed book and uninspiring photographs and illustrations. <br />The book, which covers hauntings in some of the city's boroughs, is not a large book to start with. Somewhat compact in size, the book briefly discusses hauntings such as the ghosts that roam the Old Merchant's House in SoHo, Washington Square Park, and the Customs House in lower Manhattan. The book's main weaknesses is that it appears that the author compiled all his findings together in a small notebook, and typed some words, pasted a few photographs and illustrations, and slapped an ISBN number on it. The publisher, located in Pennsylvania, apparently is not a powerhouse publishing house like those found in New York.<br />The book will make a good read for those living in the city or the surrounding area who like to read tidbits of trivial information, like myself. Overall, a rate this book a three because I haven't seen any other book of similar material on the market yet. Good attempt, but the book's author should seriously consider releasing an updated edition that has more of an eye-catching design.	2002-01-24

The author, who briefly gives the origin of the place name in a simple sentence or two, apparently has done some deep research at a local library or archive in order to amass such an extensive list of information.

The book, which revolves around the \\"Cerro Maravilla\\" incident that occurred on July 25, 1978, was the biggest political scandal to rock the U.S. Commonwealth ever. In the incident, two young independence-sympathizers were ambushed and brutally murdered by police forces. The police claimed that the two so-called \\"terrorists\\" were going to blow up a  broadcast tower, while others doubted this claim. <br />After a heavy investigation, a senate hearing was held in Puerto Rico, where it was determined that a political cover-up was involved here. The pro-statehood governor at the time, Carlos Romero Barcelo, had been implicated of planning the murder of the two youths, in order to boost his sagging popularity two years before he was up for re-election. What was uncovered shattered the reputation of Romero Barcelo, Puerto Rican police, the FBI, and especially that of the New Progressive Party (also known as PNP in its' Spanish-acronym) who favors statehood for the island, even though statehood has been rejected in each and every political referendum since the U.S. took over.<br />Author Anne Nelson. first begins her book with a discussion of Puerto Rican history before the Spanish-American War of 1898, when Spain ceded the island to the United States. She goes on to discuss early U.S. relations and policies, a discussion and history on each of the island's main parties, and finally the \\"Cerro Maravilla' incident, which is a very disturbing chapter in the democratic history of the Americas. The use of photographs were interesting, and the chart showing the damage one of the bodies suffered (over 40 bullets and massive swelling due to continuous beatings) show that this was both a unusual and cruel way for two peopleto die, especially if they were unarmed. <br />Ms. Nelson, unbiased look at this scandal did open many eyes to the injustice many political-minorities not only in Puerto Rico but elsewhere (the PAN party in Mexico is a great example, especially after their rising star and presidential candidate Donald Luis Colosio was assassinated in 1991, reportedly by henchmen hired by the PRI party, who had ruled the country for over 70 years without any opposition).  It would have been more interesting to see the actual photographs of the bodies at the murder scene, seeing that they had already appeared on the front page of  the island's newspapers the day after the incident. In a turn of events, Romero Barcelo who had served as the island's non-voting representative in the U.S. Congress during much of the 1990's was defeated for re-election in the fall of 2000. People cited he Cerro Maravilla incident and his party's (PNP) massive corruption and cover-ups during the administration of PNP governor, Pedro Rosello, as the reasons he lost. <br />Overall, Ms. Nelson has written an excellent book on a topic that needed to be discussed. Americans must be aware that this scandal took place under a colony that is under the U.S. flag for the last 102 years. If democracy can exist on the mainland, why can't it in Puerto Rico. That is a question that must be answered, and after reading this book, you will probably come up with an appropriate answer.	2000-12-24

Puerto Rican news anchor, Maria Celeste Arraras, who is one of the most respected women in her field, decided to write this book based on interviews with several people, most importantly Yolanda Saldivar, Selena's murderer.<br />First of all, let's clear things. Selena wasn't a saint, nor am I. To reach sainthood you have to have perform miracles and go through a process. With the media's power influence, Selena's &quot;canonization&quot; was unnecessary in many ways. Arraras' book, which begins with her discovering about Selena's death at the studios where she films her television show, &quot;Primer Impacto&quot; and moves on to her heading to Corpus Christi, Texas to cover her funeral and the media frenzy that followed is well-written in every sense of the word. Arraras continues with her campaign to punish shock jock Howard Stern for his spoof of Selena's final moments (a chapter that I found unnecessary) and her later investigation of Selena's final days.<br />There are many questions that are answered in this book: Why was Selena spending so much time with her plastic surgeon in Mexico? Why did the Quintanilla family did not disclose the Selena had been to a clothing factory with her &quot;male friend&quot; so many times within a few months (a fact proven by official Mexican documents)? Where was Selena's husband and what was the status of their marriage? Why did Selena choose Mexico to be the production country where her clothing line would be produced?<br />Arraras' book answers all these questions and more. The book makes you ponder about many things, especially the belief that Saldivar was an &quot;obsessed lesbian&quot; in love with Selena? After reading this book I came to think that being the only book on the market about the hidden truths that led to Selena's death, why didn't the Quintanilla family sue Arraras for slander? Why to this date they haven't sue Arraras only tells that the author did her homework in an un-biased manner, and she didn't succumb to the mob mentality that ruled Corpus Christi during Saldivar's trial. While I feel that Saldivar is guilty as sin, the other players in this book have remained out of the public spotlight ever since its' publication. Why? Read this book, analyze the facts and separate them from the fiction, and then you'll discover &quot;Selena's Secret.&quot;<br />One of the best expose books I have read in years.

Metzger and Michael D. Coogan, explore the topics of religion as discussed in the Bible. While many zealots and fanatics might disagree with several definitions/discussions such as the topics of homosexuality, prostitution, and any other acts that they feel go against God's words, the editors take a non-biased, neutral approach.<br />Topics such as Jesus' brothers and sisters (more conservative churches such as the Catholic, Anglican, and Orthodox churches claim that these were children Joseph had from a previous marriage), lesbianism (it was never demoralized in the Old Testament, but was considered immoral in one of Paul's letters after the New Testament was written) and numerology (many dispute that only 144,000 are going to enter the Kingdom of God according as many Protestant groups proclaim in their teachings) can all be of items of major discussion to Bible students or critics, but with this book it somewhat makes more sense.<br />I also enjoyed the historical chapters added by the editors that discuss the printing of Bibles throughout Europe and the New World. For example, the first Bible to be published in Spain was written in Catalan, and not in Castilian. The publication of Bibles in Native American languages also interested me, seeing that most of them are extinct today.<br />The discussion of the symbolism of numbers also captured my attention. Whether it is the most perfect number, 7, or the most incomplete, 6, the divinity of numbers in the Bible's scriptures are all discussed here. <br />Overall, &quot;The Oxford Companion to the Bible&quot; is an excellent book to delve into the importance of matters in the spiritual realm. Whether you are a believer or not, critic or student, liberalist or zealot, this book will open many minds with thoughts of what the Bible really means in our world.	2000-11-25

From Wakefield to Mott Haven, from Riverdale to Co-op City, most of the borough's major neighborhoods are captured here in photographs and words, allowing past and present Bronxites to see the changes that have occurred in the thirty-year span that the book covers.<br />It was nostalgic to see photographs of the Alexander's department store on Fordham Road, seeing that it shut it doors in the late 1980's. Other interesting facts I didn't know before was that the largest amusement park in the eastern United States, &quot;Freedomland&quot; was located on the land where present-day Co-op City stands. It was closed in the late 1960's when word of a major theme park that was to arise out of the marshes of Orlando, Florida was being planned (yep, DisneyWorld brought an end to the Bronx's only amusement park).<br />Truly this is a must have if you are a past or present Bronxite who is very interested in learning about the borough's past. This book might also appeal to urban planning students who are interested in the development of one of New York City's last frontiers. Overall, &quot;The Bronx: It Was Only Yesterday 1935-1965&quot; is a well-organized book that takes full advantage of the borough's historical archives. Once I opened its' pages I was taken on a journey to memory row, where memories of life back then only reside.	2000-11-24

The book, which is part of series that spotlights many of the world's talented film directors, features Almodovar speaking about many of his films up from &quot;Pepi, Luci, and Bom&quot; to &quot;The Flower of My Secret.&quot;<br />Providing interesting views, facts, and insight on many of his films and actors, there is no one who knows more about Almodovar than the man himself. His discussions are usually very open, especially when discussing several incidents that were high publicized in the European press, mainly his falling out with his most famous actress, Carmen Maura, after the completion of his masterpiece &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.&quot; Their professional divorce left Almodovar without a dependable leading lady (feature lead actresses Victoria Abril and Marisa Paredes never could capture Maura's persona) and it marked Maura's somewhat decline in Spanish film (she later went on to do several unsuccessful Spanish films and some television work before moving to France to break into French cinema.). <br />The book which is out of print is one of the best one-to-one interviews I've ever read. Almodovar's contributions to world cinema are so numerous that they can be all listed here, and his work has opened the door for many other Spanish and Latin American film directors such as Carlos Arau and Bruno Bareto in showing the world that foreign language films can be as professional and productive as any big budget film churned out by Hollywood. <br />&quot;Almodovar on Almodovar,&quot; is a must have for any Almodovar fan and film studies student. An excellent book on one of the world's most gifted directors.	2000-11-19

However, in \\"Face Forward,\\" Kevyn decided to employ some of the most famous faces in the entertainment world (in addition to several non-celebrities) in transforming them into personas of the past and present. <br />When I first opened this book, my mouth gaped on how powerful Kevyn's work can be. I couldn't believe my eyes on how he was able to transform Tori Amos to a Native American woman. He is amazing, and many other celebrities in this book will make you open your mouth in awe.

As a great of fan since I first saw him on the screen in &quot;Rebel Without A Cause,&quot; I can say I am so elated that there is finally a biography on this great, yet underrated actor. Sal Mineo was not just the usual movie star. He was a person who could relate to the common moviegoer due to his upbringing in the Bronx by hardworking and caring Italian immigrants. From 217th Street to Hollywood, Sal never forgot who he was, and truly was known to be a nice guy.<br />In his book &quot;Sal Mineo: His Life, Murder, and Mystery,&quot; author H. Paul Jeffers explores Sal's early days as the son of a coffin maker to his tragic end in the garage of the West Hollywood apartment complex he lived. As a close friend of Mineo's, Jeffers gives us an intimate portrait of this great actor. The only previous biographical information available on Mineo was in biographies of James Dean and magazine articles, and therefore I really can't compare this book to another Mineo biography on the market. While there is rumor that Jason Gould (Barbra Streisand's son) is writing a biography on Mineo (one of his favorite actors), we will have to wait to see if the book will paint a more complete portrait of Sal.<br />While Jeffers book succeeds in telling Mineo's rise and then fall, he focuses too much on Mineo's sexual orientation, and at times it can get boring. Just hearing that Sal's apartment was full of gay pornography and leather S&amp;M gear made me feel a bit disturbed that someone's sexual life still can hurt him after death. While Sal was one of Hollywood's first actors to come out of the closet virtually by choosing roles that reflected his sexuality, too much detail can often sour a book.<br />I was also disappointed that the author did not take more time to discuss more about Sal's family, such as his mother Josephine, brothers Victor and Michael, and sister Carina. I would have liked to see more of the family discussing Sal's importance to them and the film world, but insteadwe hear about their financial problems. To even make this point more evident, Carina's name is not even listed in the index, even though she is mentioned several times in the biography.<br />The book's photographs were great, and it was interesting to see an actual police photograph of the Sal's body covered in a blanket after an unknown assailant stabbed him to death. While the book claims that the suspect in Mineo's murder was never found responsible in his death, he is serving a sentence for it in a California prison. <br />Sal's roles as Plato in &quot;Rebel Without A Cause,&quot; Dov in &quot;Exodus&quot;, and Dino in &quot;Dino&quot; made him a star, but I would like to have know more about his roles in films that explored his sexuality to the fullest extent such as &quot;Who Killed Teddy Bear?&quot;. While his final film role was that playing an ape in &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes,&quot; Sal's career was hurt by his decision to choose film and stage roles that explored homosexuality. It was taboo then and Sal was a pioneer and rebel in the entertainment world. Sal also helped a budding new actor by the name of Don Johnson break into the big time when he starred with Mineo in the men's' prison drama &quot;Fortune and Men's Eyes&quot; in Los Angeles. This should be known, although the onstage rape scene featuring a naked Mineo and Johnson was very controversial.<br />In conclusion, this is a must have for any Mineo fan, or anyone who is fascinated by the so-called curse that afflicted the cast of &quot;Rebel Without a Cause.&quot; I could not put this book down, and you won't either. A good biography for a true Hollywood legend.	2000-10-27

The emergence of England's commercial status, the attitudes towards Creoles, and finally the Napoleonic Wars were all causes that broke the colonial ties these new republics (and in Brazil's case, an &quot;Empire&quot;) had with Madrid, Lisbon, and Paris.<br />The only thing very negative about this book was that the author decided to cover Haiti's independence movement, but never did cover that of the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Puerto Rico. The latter two, which gained independence and autonomy respectively after the Spanish-American War of 1898, have always been in the world's political spotlight then and now. It would have been interesting for Mr. Graham to cover these because their struggle was the longest independence war in the region's history (more than 10 years).<br />While the Dominican Republic gained their independence from Haiti's black rulers (the French and Spanish had fled the island after the Haitian Revolution), it would be important to cover this too. That country's struggle to break free from Haiti shows that even newly created republics in the Americas were able to be as suppressive as their European masters were. <br />Overall, this 180 page book is a great way to immense yourself in the history of one of the world's most important, and rising regions.	2000-10-22

That country's struggle to break free from Haiti shows that even newly created republics in the Americas were able to be as suppressive as their European masters were. <br />Overall, this 180 page book is a great way to immense yourself in the history of one of the world's most important, and rising regions.	2000-10-22

While his black and white imagery has always captured the eyes of many, due to his excellent depiction of the most beautiful male bodies on the planet, Bianchi's books gives anyone a reason to define beauty the way they see it.<br />It is not necessary to look like an Adonis like most of the men in this book (not that wouldn't hurt if you were one), but the fact that most of the men featured in this book are over their 40's, some even HIV+, often can open our eyes that stereotypes can't often steal from beauty's definition.<br />Whether gay or not, whether an art student or admirer, this book will give you a small glimpse and taste from one of nude photography's greatest photographers. Although this book will appeal primarily to gay men, I wouldn't toss aside if you weren't. You might discover things you didn't realize by browsing through this book.	2000-10-01

Known for his ruthlessness and his ability to make his political enemies disappear without a trace, Trujillo's regime was one of the most brutal in Latin American history.<br />After taking over the country with the assistance of the military, Trujillo began a campaign of making himself somewhat of a demigod, even renaming the nation's capital from Santo Domingo to Ciudad Trujillo (&quot;Trujillo City&quot;). During this time, four sisters unified the Dominican resistance in trying to bring freedom and justice to that nation. While their husbands suffered in the nation's worst prison, the Mirabal sisters face uncertain perils and repression from Trujillo's henchmen.<br />While the author doesn't really discuss the main reason for Trujillo's infatuation with one of the sisters, their story is one of the most memorable cases of human rights abuses on record. Trujillo, son of biracial parents, never was accepted into traditional Dominican society due to his skin color. In a country where race plays a very important role in your social standing, this was a slap to the face, and after meeting one of the Mirabal sisters before his ascent to power, and getting rejected by her, it seems like the main motives for their murders was primarily for vengeance. <br />Told from the point of view of the only sister to survive the accident that claimed the lives of the other three, Dede's view is somewhat blurry to an extent. Seeing that some of the novel has fictional dialogue, it is understandable why the novel moves in a slow, yet respectful approach.<br />Julia Alvarez, who also wrote &quot;Yo!&quot; and &quot;How the Garcia Sisters Lost Their Accents&quot; is probably the best writer to come out of the Spanish-speaking Caribbean inrecent years. A resident of Vermont, Ms. Alvarez is an intelligent, well-researched woman who has given the world works that explore the trials and tribulations faced by many Dominicans on and off the island. <br />The Mirabal sister's legacy has been remembered worldwide. The date three of the sisters died now has become the United Nation's &quot;International Day Against Violence Towards Women.&quot; Also in an ironic twist, one of Dede's sons became Vice-President of the Dominican Republic in 1995 when he and presidential candidate Leonel Fernandez defeated incumbent Joaquin Balaguer in that year's elections. Joaquin Balaguer was Trujillo's protege and right-hand man, and it was at Balaguer's insistance that Trujillo be buried at Paris' Pere LaChaise cemetery (final resting place of &quot;Doors&quot; singer Jim Morrison and author Oscar Wilde) in order to prevent his grave's desecration.<br />Presently, Mexican superstar Salma Hayek has purchased the rights to this novel, and is currently filming the story of the Mirabal sisters into a motion picture that will air on the Showtime cable network in 2001. Hopefully, Ms. Hayek's film will capture the importance of Ms. Alvarez's novel without leaving out any details.

W. Wheeler, Alan Yates, and Nicolau Dols is the best book on the market in learning this widely spoken Romance language.<br />Published by the magnificent British publishing giant, Routledge Press, this book will give you the lowdown on everything you need to read, write, and understand Catalan. Grammar, structure, verb conjugations are all covered here. Mr. Yates, who in my opinion is one of the best Catalan linguists in the world, previously wrote the excellent &quot;Teach Yourself Catalan&quot; book, which was the first book that allow me to comprehend Catalan in little time.<br />Both Wheeler and Yates, who are professors at two universities in Great Britain, along with Dols, who teaches at a university in Spain, have done an excellent job in capturing the essence and importance of this language.<br />While Catalan is primarily spoken only in four countries (Spain, France, Andorra, and Italy), it is a language that should be studied by those interested in Catalan studies. Travelers and businessmen to Catalonia and the Balearic Islands will find this book helpful in learning this language, that although it is the seventh most spoken in the European Union, it is not officially recognized by that organization.<br />If you want to learn Catalan, I suggest the following books.<br />(1) &quot;Teach Yourself Catalan&quot; by Alan Yates<br />(2) &quot;Catalan Sin Enfuerzo&quot; by the Assimil staff (for Spanish speakers wanting to learn Catalan)<br />(3) &quot;Catalan-English Dictionary&quot; by the Routledge Press staff (It is about $30)<br />(4) &quot;Cambridge Word Selector: English-Catalan&quot; by the Cambridge University Press staff.<br />With these books, you'll be mastering this once-forbidden language in no time.

There are many reasons this book never did well among the eyes of critics and readers. They include <br />(1) The book was written in English. Upon its' release, the book stirred controversy in Puerto Rico, due to that nation's use and respect for Spanish. Ms. Ferre's political connections (her father, Luis, was a former governor of the island who favored statehood) probably had a lot to do with this, and one thing writers know is not to mix a book's imminent success with cultural nationalism. <br />(2) The book's references to Spanish colonialism seems very negative and critical. Again, Ms. Ferre's leaning towards everything Pro-American can't undo the 400 years of colonialism Spain has left on the island, especially when it comes to its' language. As a Puerto Rican of Spanish descent, I found it both insulting and disturbing that although the Spanish were not perfect, Ms. Ferre decided to put down the country that gave Puerto Ricans many things that we can't erase or deny. Surnames, religion, place names, history, and culture are contributions that can't be undone. <br />(3) Ms. Ferre's characters seem to be out-of-touch with the common Puerto Rican. Although there are social elites who wield money (statehooders) and the ideologically elite who possess great knowledge and love for their nation (independence seekers), she really has never written about the &quot;jibaro&quot; and other traditional rural characters that gave Puerto Rico her identity. Truly this is her greatest mistake. <br />Ms. Ferre is no Julia de Burgos, nor she will never be. She is no Esmeralda Santiago who has written novels that are relevant to the Puerto Rican experience. She is no Julia Alvarez, the Dominican writer who is possibly the greatest Latinawriter to come out of the Caribbean in recent years. Ferre is unique, and in my opinion is that unless she gives un-biased, apolitical accounts of Puerto Rican life in her future novels, she might as well pack up her typewriter and put it in the closet. Overall, a disappointing novel.	2000-10-01

I know people who still think that Tupac Shakur faked his death, and I surely                      seen people jump into fights that don't involve them. These and the other 147 reasons are                      guaranteed to make anyone who grew up in such cities as New York, Chicago, or Los Angeles                      roll on the floor laughing.<br />                     Being a small, thin book with only 79 pages should make this an easy read while you commute or                      travel, however I must warn you that people will stare at you if you start to laugh too hard. In the                      same way the Wayans' brothers spoofed the blaxploitation films of the 1970's with the film &quot;I'm                      Gonna Git You Sucka,&quot; the authors of this book do the same when it comes to urban life.

Whether is Kelly giving advice to a desperate Marcy on how to catch a man, or Al's constant views on life and other things important to the average joe (specifically women), the quotes in this book are all great views on life and love. Peg, the sex-starved, chimney-smoking housewife, has to be the best person in my opinion in giving advice and making observations about many things, mainly Al and men.<br />Please note that the cover you see in the photograph is not the same as the cover of the actual book. The actual cover has a cast photograph from the show's final season featuring Al, Peg, Kelly, Bud, Marcy, Jefferson, and Lucky (who replaced Buck the dog after he passed away).

While many gay celebrity couples such as Ellen DeGeneres &amp; Anne Heche and Melissa Etheridge and Julie Cypher have come out together with little or no opposition from both the media and society. The story of how these two men came out is an inspiration to all seeking acceptance, regardless of your sexual orientation.<br />Bob Paris, who was one of professional bodybuilding's top stars and Rod Jackson, a former Playgirl Man of the Year, met, fell in love, and later went on to stage a ceremonial wedding where they exchange vows. &quot;Straight From the Heart,&quot; is mostly an autobiographical account of their lives, from their childhoods to their present-day lives. Although Paris and Jackson broke off their relationship in 1997, their story is still an excellent account of what it is to be gay and famous in today's society.<br />The book can be a tad bit too lame when it comes to both authors giving each other accolades or affection. However, I was intrigued by both Bob and Rod's touring the country and speaking at universities, colleges, and at events about their struggle for acceptance and their advocacy for gay &amp; lesbian rights. The tour opened up in my alma mater, Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, where the authors faced a crowd that was both rude and anxious to hear them speak. I found that interesting because their appearance came a few years before I enrolled there. <br />&quot;Straight From the Heart,&quot; is an interesting account of how love knows no boundaries. While Jackson hasn't been so visible in the spotlight lately, Bob Paris continues to be a best-selling author or fitness and gay studies books. He is an excellent author, as well as a fascinating individual. I recommend this book toanyone wanting to know what it feels like to risk everything in your life in order to pursue happiness with the one you love.	2000-09-21

With the ban on Argentine beef,  Brazilian farmers saw the Amazon as being an emerging area to raise cattle  in order to meet the world demand for beef. Miners, who were moving onto  Indian lands to mine for gold, copper, and other minerals were also  effecting the rainforest's ecology.<br />Mendes, who was a  &quot;seringuiero,&quot; or &quot;rubber-tapper,&quot; relied on the  Amazon's vast supply of rubber trees in order to make a living. Seeing that  his source of income was in peril with the elimination of trees in order to  make room for miners and farmers, Mendes began a national movement to  awaken the consciousness of the world about the obvious dangers that lurked  nearby if the rainforest was cleared. However, his life will take a tragic  turn when he was only starting to gain international awareness and support  for his movement.<br />The first few chapters of the book discuss the  importance the rainforest plays when it comes to the spectrum of life on  earth. The rainforest's vast fauna, flora, and wildlife have allowed many  native cultures to survive for centuries, before and after the arrival of  the Spanish and Portuguese conquistadors. The Amazon's emergence as a  battleground for the discovery and development of cures and vaccines for  various diseases and maladies has become more important in recent years,  especially as pharmaceutical companies search for an AIDS vaccine. The rest  of the book discusses Chico's early life, his career, family, and activism,  and allevents of importance to his movement after his death, especially  the trial that brought those responsible for his death to justice. <br />This  is a must-read book for everyone. Chico Mendes' mission to educate the  world of the immense importance that Brazil's rainforest is to world's  climate control should not die in vain. This important, ethical book will  awaken your awareness of what the Amazon's destruction and development will  have on the world's population.

With  outrageous, comical illustrations by George Hay, the books looks at life in  the ghetto in a humorous view, by poking fun at stereotypes that are  obviously true.<br />This book will make anyone laugh, especially if you grew  up or live in any huge urban metropolis where a ghetto exists. I grew up in  New York City, and can I tell you that I could not stop laughing after  reading this book, because it is so, so true. I have known girls whose  names start with &quot;La,&quot; &quot;Ta,&quot; and &quot;Sha&quot;. I  know people who still think that Tupac Shakur faked his death, and I surely  seen people jump into fights that don't involve them. These and the other  147 reasons are guaranteed to make anyone who grew up in such cities as New  York, Chicago, or Los Angeles roll on the floor laughing.<br />Being a small,  thin book with only 79 pages should make this an easy read while you  commute or travel, however I must warn you that people will stare at you if  you start to laugh too hard. In the same way the Wayans' brothers spoofed  the blaxploitation films of the 1970's with the film &quot;I'm Gonna Git  You Sucka,&quot; the authors of this book do the same when it comes to  urban life.

Betterton is an interesting, fact-filled book about interesting, and little  known facts about America's many colleges and universities. Being the  country with the greatest number of higher-learning institutions in the  world, the United States possesses a variety of schools that have been able  to stand apart from one another due to their locations and/or school  traditions.<br />This book, which was published by Peterson's Guides, the same  company that publishes the thick college guides many high school students  use during their search for the right school, is interesting because it  discusses the little-known facts that you definitely won't find in an  admissions brochure. From most preppiest schools, to the origin of many  schools' names, this book will fascinate alums all over the country and  world. I discovered that my alma mater was voted one of the five most  preppiest in the United States (I wasn't shocked). I also read where many  famous celebrities attended school, what they studied and who were Rhodes  scholars (actor/singer Kris Kristofferson was a Rhodes scholar while  studying at Pomona College during the 1950's).<br />If you are a person who  loves interesting facts, then this book if the right choice for you. You  will be surprised what you'll find about many schools in this book.	2000-09-10

Poet Joaquin Hernandez Jimenez  , honors every Puerto  Rican town and city from Adjuntas to Yauco with poems and odes celebrating  their uniqueness, nicknames, landmarks, and other characteristics that set  them apart from one another. Even the district of Rio Piedras (which is  part of San Juan) and the uninhabited island of Mona are also celebrated in  separate poems. Hernandez Jimenez's poetry, which can be moving and  amusing, is a delight to read.<br />If you are Puerto Rican, or an admirer of  the island's culture and people, then I highly recommend this book. By  reading this compilation of poetry, you will get a better portrait of life,  traditions, and other aspects that Puerto Ricans treasured about their  island and towns. In addition to the tribute to all of the island's towns,  Rio Piedras, and Mona Island, the book contains four additional poems that  celebrate Puerto Rico's beauty and people. &quot;Viviras&quot; and  &quot;Habla Roberto Clemente&quot; are two tributes to the island's  greatest baseball player, Roberto Clemente. The Carolina, Puerto Rico  native rose to prominence with the Pittsburgh Pirates and became a major  league star during the 1960's. After organizing a relief effort to help  victims of a terrible earthquake in Nicaragua, Clemente showed that as a  professional baseball player he still had a heart when it came to those who  needed help. However, he died when the plane with relief supplies crashed  into the waters of the Caribbean Sea shortly after taking off from San  Juan.<br />The two other Poems, &quot;Canto a Arecibo,&quot; and &quot;Ay de  Mi Borinquen&quot; celebrate the beauty of the town of Arecibo and the  island in lyrical poetry. These, and the book's other poems make this a  must read for anyone who loves Spanish-language prose. It makes an  excellent addition to anyone's library.	2000-09-09

Besides this fault, this book will make excellent  reading material for anyone trying to brush up on their Spanish before a  trip, meeting, or just to chat with a friend or relative.	2000-08-06

Homosexuality, lesbianism, and fetishes were all somewhat taboos  to be discussed or shown in public, however nowadays attitudes have  changed. In some ways, Madonna was a pioneer, and as so, she deserves  credit for being the most outrageous, daring woman of the 20th century.	2000-07-18

The  author, who obviously has done good research on the Takara/Hasbro toy line  regarding the appearance of new characters and/or physical changes to  certain toys, however the photography could have been better. It looks like  Mr. Alvarez was in a rush to get these photographs taken (he mentions the  photography costs). My advice for future editions of this book is to first  get a better publisher (Schiffer collectible books have always looked  shoddy in design).<br />In simple words, this book makes a modest try in to  disuss the Transformers , however with better planning, photography and  design, it could be a whole lot better.	2000-07-15

However, after discovering this book in a local bookstore, I discovered that this town was  of some importance to many living in the metropolitan area due to its'  seaside retreats, close proximity to Sandy Hook Beach, and the town's many  Victorian homes. While Keyport won't stand out among other more popular  suburban towns such as Asbury Park, its' charm remains intact. Reading this  book gave me a little more background on the town's history and  development, and it was interesting to see that many of the sites in the  book still remain today.<br />If you are a native of Monmouth County, or have  a friend or relative who lives in the area, then this book will be a great  inclusion into your library. The town's historical society as well as the  author have done an excellent job covering the history of the town that  time and modernism somewhat forgot.	2000-07-14

Similiar to many celebrity photographers such as Richard Avedon, David LaChapelle, and Annie  Liebowitz, Ritts captures the essence that is celebrity perfectly. Whether  it is the photograph of Madonna and Sean Pean as a loving couple, or a  gathering of today's top supermodels (all nude) Ritts has an eye for  detail, as well as an approach few photographers nowadays don't utilize,  direct communication with your subjects. In the past (and even in the  present) celebrity photography can be a pain as many celebrities tend to  want their agents around them whenever there is a shoot. <br />Many of Ritts  photographs in this compilation happen to be of a homoerotic nature. Ritts,  who is openly gay, captures the essence of male sexuality perfect, and the  results can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their orientation.<br />I hope  in the future Ritts comes out with another huge compilation of his work.  His recent work with such celebrities such as Monica Lewinsky and Janet  Jackson should be published in a volume, but for the meanwhile, purchase  this book for your coffee table or library. It will make an interesting  topic of conversation with anyone. Ritts is pure genius!	2000-07-14

Moving into the wrong  neighborhood can often be both dangerous and unproductive for many  outsiders (and even natives) who want to move to due to reasons relating to  crime, finances, or proximity to jobs.<br />Well the New York Times has  compiled a book of essays about the area's best communities to live in,  which should make the job of choosing the right neighborhood much more  easier. &quot;If You're Thinking...&quot; provides plenty of statistical  and residential information that will prove helpful to anyone looking for  new communities in the city. Although the book is very outdated when it  comes to rents (a 2 bedroom in story has shot up to $1,200 in 1999) and the  author doesn't really cover the recent changes in the ethnic compositions  of some neighborhoods (Astoria, Queens is becoming heavily Brazilian,  Colombian, and Mexican; Riverdale in the Bronx has seen a huge influx of  Dominican immigrants; Inwood in Manhattan has also a huge Dominican  population; etc..).<br />Overall this is a good book to review your choices  before moving to the area, however I feel that an updated version is needed  in the market.

While at a bookstore in Madrid, I encountered  this book on a shelf and found it fascinating to read and study. while the  language is primarily spoken in 4 countries (Catalonia, Spain; Southeastern  France; Sardinia, Italy; and Andorra (its' official language) it still  holds plenty of power in Europe, being one of the top ten most spoken in  the European Union (although not official.<br />The author took his time in  researching the language and he clearly states the dialect taught in the  book differs from other Catalan dialects such as Valenciano or Mallorquin.  This is very important, especially if traveling and/or doing business in  this region of Europe, where dialects are plenty. I read the book, and  after a while, I surprised my pen pal near Barcelona with a letter in  Catalan. He was blown away that I wrote the language so well on my first  try.<br />This book will help you learn grammar, vocabulary, and sentence  structure, however as the other reviewer of this book said, the only thing  negative is that there is no audio tapes to accompany this book. Many  language books in the Teach Yourself! series have audio tapes, however it  is very difficult to speak Catalan without listening to a native speaker. I  had to go on the web to hear some examples, and even this is difficult,  because only a few phrases are said.<br />I contaced the publisher by mail,  and I got the same response. There is not an audio companion to the book. I  am so disappointed about this, however this shouldn't be a reason not to  buy this book. Mr. Yates, who has written other books on the series has  done an excellent job covering this once-forbidden language (Franco  prohibited its' use in public during his regime).<br />If you are interested  in learning this language, I recommend the following books:<br />(1) Cambridge  Word Selector : English - Catalan<br />(2) Catalan sin Enfuerzo (for Spanish  speakers who want to learn Catalan)<br />(3) Catalan Dictionary  :English-Catalan/Catalan-English (by Routledge Press)<br />Let's hope in the  future that NTC Publishing will change its' mind and release an audio tape  companion to this book, but for now, the best way to learn phonetically is  to find a private tutor.ge  Word Selector : English - Catalan<br />(2) Catalan sin Enfuerzo (for Spanish  speakers who want to learn Catalan)<br />(3) Catalan Dictionary  :English-Catalan/Catalan-English (by Routledge Press)<br />Let's hope in the  future that NTC Publishing will change its' mind and release an audio tape  companion to this book, but for now, the best way to learn phonetically is  to find a private tutor.	2000-07-07

Since both Cuba and Puerto Rico were the last two  Spanish colonies in the New World, their histories are closely interwoven  with one another. The adoption of the battle flag design both countries use  for their national flags, the language, food, and climates illustrate the  similarities both islands share with one another. Being related with one  another and having a similar oppressor, Cuba and Puerto Rico are the truest  sister islands the world has.<br />Due to events in Cuba, especially the  Revolution of 1959, many Cubans immigrated and left their island and many  settled in Puerto Rico. The island, as a U.S. Commonwealth offered Cubans  security, U.S. citizenship, and an environment where they were able to live  the lives they once lived in pre-castro Cuba. Unlike Cubans in Miami,  Cubans residing in Puerto Rico are less political about what is happening  in their island, and many have intermarried with prominent Puerto Ricans  families and unified their cultures together. The author does a wonderful  job in utilizing statistics, polls, and surveys on attitudes this community  has. While many outsiders of Cuban-Puerto Rican politics might not see the  relevance of other latino groups moving into other Latino countries, it is  still important to know what can go right and wrong in those places,  because it will clearly have an effect here in the United States. Places  like in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles will see mass immigration of newly  emerging Latino groups moving into areas once occupied by another Latino  group (e.g. Mexicans moving into New York's Puerto Rican-held &quot;Spanish  Harlem&quot;; Nicaraguans moving into Cuban-held Hialeah, Florida;  etc.)<br />Whether you are a great consumer of Bacardi Rum (originallyfrom  Cuba the Bacardi family resettled in Puerto Rico), a fan of singer Carlos  Ponce (although he is proud of his Puerto Rican roots and culture, his  parents are Cuban immigrants), or  just want to learn more about  Cuban-Puerto Rican relations on the island, this is an excellent book.  Although tension between both communities exist somewhat ion the mainland  U.S. (mostly due to opinions on the Elian Gonzalez case and the release of  Puerto Rican nationalists by president Clinton), it shouldn't be a reason  not to read this book. A must have for Latin American history and politics  readers/students.	2000-06-22

There are many reasons this book never did  well among the eyes of critics and reaaders. They include <br />(1) The book  was written in English. Upon its' release, the book stirred controversy in  Puerto Rico, due to that nation's use and respect for Spanish. Ms. Ferre's  political connections (her father, Luis, was a former governor of the  island who favored statehood) probably had a lot to do with this, and one  thing writers know is not to mix a book's imminent success with cultural  nationalism. <br />(2) The book's references to Spanish colonialism seems very  negative and crtical. Again, Ms. Ferre's leaning towards everything  Pro-American can't undo the 400 years of colonialism Spain has left on the  island, especially when it comes to its' language. As a Puerto Rican of  Spanish descent, I found it both insulting and disturbing that although the  Spanish were not perfect, Ms. Ferre decided to put down the country that  gave Puerto Ricans many things that we can't erase or deny. Surnames,  religion, place names, history, and culture are contributions that can't be  undone.<br />(3) Ms. Ferre's characters seem to be out-of-touch with the  common Puerto Rican. Although there are social elites who wield money  (statehooders) and the ideologically elite who possess great knowledge and  love for their nation (independence seekers), she really has never written  about the &quot;jibaro&quot; and other traditional rural characters that  gave Puerto Rico her identity. Truly this is her greatest mistake.<br />Ms.  Ferre is no Julia de Burgos, nor she will never be. She is no Esmeralda  Santiago who has written novels that are relevant to the Puerto Rican  experience. She is no Julia Alvarez, the Dominican writer who is possibly  the greatest Latina writer to come out of the Caribbean in recent years.  Ferre is unique, and in my opinion is that unless she gives un-biased,  apolitical accounts of Puerto Rican life in her future novels, she might as  well pack up her typewriter and put it in the closet. Overall, a  disappointing novel.	2000-06-22

As a native New Yorker, I heard of many islands that occupied the waters that surrounded the five boroughs of the city. As I flew back into LaGuardia and JFK airports I even began to notice them from above.  Obtaining information about these islands was very difficult, even from  local libraries, and therefore when I found this book at a local bookstore,  I was delighted that someone came up with the idea of publishing such a  book. <br />From Roosevelt Island to Cuban Ledge, the authors give a very  thorough and well researched book on the many islands inhabiting the New  York archipelago. Many islands which were once islands, but have long since  been connected to the boroughs by artificial landfills are also covered  here (e.g. Coney Island-Brooklyn, Hunter Island-Bronx, Battery Park  area-Manhattan, etc..) are also covered here. <br />If you live in the city or  plan on visiting, please make sure to pick up a copy of this guide, and  make sure to visit the many hidden treasures found in this city.It makes an  excellent companion book while aboard a plane or even in the subway.	2000-06-04

As the title  reads, the book discusses the world's major languages in order by their  origin groups (e.g. Teutonic/Germanic, Romance, Slavic, etc...) and Comrie  in my opinion is the best author when it comes to distinguishing languages.  <br />At 1,025 pages, this book gives an extensive history and study of most  of the major languages. While one reviewer on this forum was upset that  Native American languages weren't cover, I feel that Mr. Comrie did his  best in discussing only those languages with over 10 million present-day  speakers. <br />I feel it would be important for many interested in cultural  politics where language places a major role in dividing a nation or region  (e.g. Canada/Quebec, Flemish &amp; Walloons in Belgium, Puerto Rico &amp;  U.S., Spain's central government and Catalans and Basques) to read this  book. I feel that the only lanaguage that wasn;t covered but should have  been was Catalan, seeing that over 13 million people speak it and it is the  7th most spoken in the European Union (although it is not officially  recognized by the organization). Besides this omission, this is one of the  nest books I have read in years! A must-read for anyone interested in  languages and culture.	2000-06-03

Whethere it is the influx of American culture  and goods into the region or the complex nature of racial politics in Haiti  and the Dominican Republic, Kurlansky awakens the reader's mind with  interesting tidbits and case studies. This should a must-read for students  or admirers of Latin American &amp; Caribbean culture and society. It  should also be read by many here in the United States who want to know a  bit more about the recent waves of immigrants from the Caribbean and what  is motiviating the mass exoduses from their lovely islands.

The title, referring to the  island nation and Manhattan Island in New York City (which houses the  largest Dominican community in the world outside the island) catches one's  attention, as this group stands to become the third largest group of  Latinos in the United States (after Mexican-Americans and Puerto Ricans).  The author has done careful and thoughful research in explaining the wave  of Dominican immigration to the U.S., however little is covered on the  large waves of Dominican immigrants to neighboring Puerto Rico or the  Netherlands/Netherlands Antilles. You don't have to live in or near  Washington Heights (the Manhattan neighborhood with the largest Dominican  community in the city) to really grasp this books importance. As Latinos  stand to replace African-Americans as the largest minority group in the  country, it is important to understand why this is happening now and now  back in the 1960's (Trujillo regime did not permit emigration from the  country) or why many chose to go to New York. In addition to this book  readers should also pick up a copy of the books &quot;Why the Cocks  Fight,&quot; and &quot;Sugarball&quot; to understand the Dominican  experience entirely. Overall, this is one of the best anthropology books I  ever read and I highly recommend it to all.	2000-06-03

Unlike the  only other Caribbean island to be shared by two foreign powers (St.  Martin/St. Maarten), Hispaniola's history has always been linked to the  topic of race and culture. As a student of Latin American &amp; Caribbean  politics and culture, I discovered many hidden truths I never knew when I  was living in the cultural melting pot know as New York City. This book  gave me even a greater understanding of two communities that are so close  in proximity, yet so far apart in everything else.<br />Ms. Wucker definately  has done extensive research and has delved into the complexity of racial  politics on this island. Her research is not biased (as one reviewer feels  it is) but rich in truth. As an author myself, I have written a book that  will be published in the near future on the political legacy a famous  Dominican politician has left his country, and Ms. Wucker's research  coincides with the same exact research I did.<br />Although the author is not  Haitian or Dominican, it shouldn't matter because she has done a  magnificent job. I always said &quot;it sometimes takes an outsider to  understand and resolve the problems of a place he/she has never lived  in.&quot; Ms. Wucker's work validates this saying.<br />Whether you are in  Miami's Little Haiti or in New York City's Washington Heights  neighborhoods, or even in some faraway place that is not directly affected  by either Dominican or Haitian immigration or politics, this should be a  must read for all. By reading this book, you might have understand what  U.S. President Ulysses Grant was thinking when he declined an offer to  &quot;purchase&quot; the Dominican Republic shortly after the end of the  Civil War.<br />Overall, this is an excellent book and a must-read for anyone  who is interested in cultural or political studies in the Third World.	2000-06-03

Although she never gained the mass media attention Gabriela Mistral gained after winning the Nobel Prize in Literature, de Burgos' work is eternally  mesmerizing. Here is a woman who led an unhappy life searching for love,  only to find heartbreak most of the times. A protege of Neruda's, de  Burgos' political activisim in supporting various causes (including  criticism of the Franco regime in Spain and Trujillo regime in the  Dominican Republic, in addition to her passionate support for independence  for Puerto Rico) is clearly shown in her work.  Her romaticism and her  cultural reconnection can also be read in some of her poems. The one that  realy captivated me was Poem #37, &quot;I Love You,&quot; which will cause  the reader to grasp their chest with the emotion she has poured in letting  the love of her life know how much he moved her world.  <br />Ms. De Burgos  died a tragic death in New York, however after it was discovered she had  been buried on Hart Island (New York City's version of a potter's field) a  movement to give her a proper and glorious funeral took place and although  she left the island as an unknown schoolteacher, she returned a national  hero. Her glorious return to Puerto Rico was well deserving. I can tell you  that reading this book brought me to tears. The great thing is that the  entire book is a bilingual edition, which will allow both English &amp;  Spanish-language readers to discover one of the greatest poets of the 20th  century.<br />A must have for readers of poerty, Latin American literature,  and Spanish students.

From her childhood years in New York to the present day,  Diana Dubois paints an unflattering picture of the second most famous  Bouvier sister. With the resecent death of her son Anthony (he passed away  from cancer only two weeks shortly  after the death of his beloved cousin,  John F. Kennedy Jr. in a plane crash) the lives of Lee and Jackie are  eerily similar. Married to powerful men, considered regal in social  circles, each had a son and a daughter, etc.. Lee's life as a primadonna  will leave many with negative thoughts for years to come. If you are into  sensationalism, this book is for you.	2000-05-26

This time they have researched and presented a through and excellent travel guide to Puerto Rico. Everything from culture, to popular sayings are covered here. The series, which is  well-known for covering off-the-beaten-track locales has done an excellent  job of covering the rarely visited satellite islands of Vieques, Culebra,  and Mona excellently. Mona was esepcially interesting to see seeing that it  so hard to reach from even the main island. The only thing I found  inaccurate in the book was the author's classification of Puerto Rican  Spanish as &quot;Boricua&quot;. The language is Spanish, but the dialect  that is spoken on the island is also commonly heard throughout the  Spanish-speaking countries of the Caribbean Basin. It is know as Antillean  Spanish. Boricua (derived from the indigenous name of the island,  &quot;Borinquen&quot;) is an affectionate term used by islanders to refer  to one of their own (just in the same way native Floridians are known as  &quot;Crackers,&quot; and Northerners are known as &quot;Yankees&quot;).  With that exception, this book is the best book on the market when  traveling to this beautiful island. I also highly recommend the Insight  Guide to Puerto Rico. A must have for every traveler!	2000-05-26

Fantastic compilation of the the most-tyranical mayor in New York's history, this book compels readers to reconsider everything Hizzoner has done for the city in the name of law and order. Regardlessly if you call  him Ghoul-iani, Hizzoner, or Il Duce 2, this book will provide you with  humorous quotes and anecdotes from his two terms in office. I can  understand know why Donna Hanover wants a divorce! In the same tradition as  the feeble-minded Geroge W. Bush, Giuliani's neurotic personality is  vividly put to public scrutiny here (and deservingly so). Gracie Mansion  wasn't the same when he became mayor,and when he exits, it sure will be an  important and memorable period of tyranical politicians do in the name of  the right-wing. An excellent book for New Yorkers and those who aren't!	2000-05-25

An excellent book for Spanish speakers wanting to learn the norms and basics of speaking Catalan, one of the several Romance-based languages found in Europe. Spoken by over 7 million people in Spain, France, Andorra  (it's official language) and Italy (Sardinia), Catalan is one of the ten  most spoken languages in the European Union (although it is not recognized  as an official language of that organization. This book will appeal to  those interested in traveling to Catalonia (Spain), Barcelona, the Balaeric  Islands for pleasure or business. It also is an excellent book for those  interested in Iberian/Catalan Studies and/or Linguistics. Will make an  excellent book to read on a plane or train.	2000-04-28

Known for his outrageous photography and amazing phototaking techniques, LaChapelle has built a modest legion of fans throughout the world. Similar to Warhol's use of pop icons, Hotel LaChapelle compiles most of his work  since the release of his first book. Many celebrities such as Madonna,  Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg reappear in this compilation, and as  usual, LaChapelle does a fantastic job of reaching new visionary limits.  Fans of Matthew Rolston and Herb Ritts will enjoy this book, but LaChapelle  is in a class by himself. He is America's equivalent to Dali.	2000-04-26
