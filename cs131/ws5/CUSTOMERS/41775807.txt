The three women represent three generations that overcome and persevere over the obstacles that we can all relate to. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a good book to escape into; this is the one.  I personally loved the metaphor about weaving a deliberate flaw into the tapestry .  The simple fact is that life isn't perfect.  What we do with those imperfections is the core that defines who we are. <br /> <br />This is Ms Anderson's second novel and I am quickly becoming a fan.  Well done.	2005-08-10

I must admit that my knowledge of Tony Orlando wasn't much more than watching him on TV in the 70's with Dawn.  My husband and I recently went to a concert of his in Connecticut. We loved the concert and were mesmerized by his charismatic showmanship and his energetic style.  He is a truly unselfish performer that gives credit and the spotlight to his backups.  One young man did a Led Zeppelin number that knocked our socks off.  When someone in the audience wanted him to sign their book, I knew it was a book I wanted to read.  There was obviously more to him than just \\"Tying a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree.\\" <br /> <br />I found this book to be a real page-turner.  Anyone that has an interest in the nostalgic days of music will find themselves engrossed in this honest, well told autobiography.  Mr. Orlando's association with the top names in the music industry is a virtual Who's Who.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I found it to be a painfully honest look back at a young man's rise to fame, fall from grace, and his ultimate journey back up the ladder.	2004-11-29

It is a non-fictional novel, told in the first person, which will easily bring the reader along on the often rocky road with the author. <br /> <br />As a grandmother of four children being brought up in the insidious life of abuse, Ms Dawn decides to fight for the right to adopt them.  It is a constant, uphill battle dealing with a system full of long delays and outdated methods.  Facing the irresponsibility of a son is one cross to bear.  Trying to repair the psychological traumas of the children while taking on agencies in two different states is more than any one person should have to handle.  Yet, Ms Dawn does it with perseverance, love and a spirituality that evolves over time. <br /> <br />I found this book to be educational in its attention to RAD (reactive attachment disorder).  It was honest and straightforward in its approach to the difficulties of raising a second family.  I applaud the author for telling her story.  It is not an easy story to share.  But books about the abuse of our most vulnerable members of society must be brought out into the open if we are ever going to address and correct the problem.  Since more and more grandparents are bringing up their grandchildren, I think this book will be helpful to others that find themselves in the same position.  Education is empowering and this book is designed to educate.  Ms Dawn is certainly an inspiration and a fighter that has earned the right to raise her grandchildren.  My best wishes to all of them.	2004-11-24

After reading his first book, Sock Monkey Blues, I couldn't wait to be captivated by another Joe Box mystery.  I was not disappointed.  UNTIL THE LAST DOG DIES is yet another treasure to be devoured by any mystery enthusiast.  Mr. Robinson certainly has a gift for weaving interesting plots, creating larger than life characters, and blending reality with spirituality while maintaining a sense of humor. <br /> <br />This is a smooth, fast paced read that never lets you down.  The reader easily feels like part of each scene while maintaining a healthy distance, lurking in the dark shadows.  There should be a reason to read a book.  Mr. Robinson's hook is the human character he has created with Joe Box.  Joe is the sarcastic, street-smart private eye that maintains his edge while showing a hint of his vulnerabilities.  He is a loveable character indeed.  Add the suspense and you have one outstanding read.  Well done and highly recommended.	2004-10-28

I'VE NEVER BEEN AN OLD MAN is a must read for baby boomers and seniors.  New author, Don Larsen, has written a non-fictional account of his personal triumphs and setbacks as he enters a new phase of his life; an elderly man caring for his ailing wife.  This is much more than a man relaying his experiences as a caregiver.  Mr. Larsen has created a humnorous, honest approach to handling what life is throwing his way.<br />Readers will be treated to an attitude that we should all try to emulate.  Mr. Larsen has a zest for life that leaves me in awe, as well as exhausted.  With his personal philisophy being, &quot;I believe an active mind and body retards the aging process&quot;, it is obvious that being in his late 70's is not a reason to give up and sit in a rocker.<br />Under the humor and the day-to-day obstacles in his life, there is a moving love story that emerges quietly.  After being married for well over 50 years, his beloved wife Jacquie has numerous health problems as well as impending dementia.  They take showers together so he can hold her, protect her from falling, and be by her side.  Those are certainly not the reasons they might have showered together many years before.  This might not be the love carried out as a physical act, but it is love at its most pure.  It was a poignant and moving scene that brought tears to my eyes.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone that needs a reality check on aging.  If you are a senior that can't get motivated or if you are a boomer with parents that can't get involved in life, this book is for you!  This book might just be the inspiration to get up, get out, and live life to the fullest.  I found it to be an enjoyable read from cover to cover.  Don't wait until your &quot;golden years&quot; to enjoy the fruits of your labor....enjoy them NOW.  If you are in your golden years, take a page from Mr. Larsen's book and find ways to stay active.  &quot;Get in; buckle your seat belt, and enjoy some of his golden years, his cats, health misfortunes, and anything else crossing the highway of his life.&quot;  You will be glad you did.<BR>(Reviewed for Denise's Pieces Book Reviews)	2004-06-28

THE FIRE WITHIN is a must read for stroke survivors and their loved ones!  It is a non-fictional account by Valerie Greene. She writes about her journey to overcome the obstacles she faced after suffering a massive stroke at the young age of 31.  Although it is a story of triumph over tragedy, it is much more than that.  Valerie shares her insight and knowledge as she strives to become a survivor instead of a victim.  Her constant enthusiasm and drive is a true inspiration.  Readers will cheer her on with each page.<br />While some tried to convince her to accept her limitations after the stroke, it only ignited the fire within her.  She took that determiniation and set high goals for herself.  This is a book that will apeal to everyone.  Readers can feel her strength and purpose as she deals with each barrier.<br />This is a focused, passionate, and honest story.

New author, Theresa Magliano, shares her life with readers.  She grew up in a world that was the epitome of the dysfunctional family.  Many readers will get an education on child abuse; many will relate all too easily.<br />Theresa didn't know that her life was not \\"normal\\" while growing up.  It's a common side effect of abuse.  It is the dirty little secret that nobody talks about.  Her strong will to survive and overcome the poverty, low self-esteem, and guilt associated with physical, sexual, and mental abuse will have readers cheering quietly from the sidelines for her survival.<br />This story is often raw and graphic.  I would not recommend it for readers that want to believe in the \\"Ozzie and Harriet\\" myth.  But for readers that want to be more cognizant of a life that is lead by our smallest, most vulnerable victims, it is a must read!  Understanding abuse, and recognizing the signs of it will make us a more compassionate society that will report suspected abuse and protect the children.  Authors like Theresa Magliano and Dave Pelzer should be commended for sharing their stories.  It is often painful, but the determination to survive and move forward is compelling.  I could not put this book down.  It is a fast paced, powerful read.<BR>(Reviewed for Denise's Pieces Book Reviews)	2004-04-07

It could also be an interesting read for men that are open to enlightenment on the sheer determination of women with courage.  Joyce S. Anderson has pulled together an assortment of women with a story to tell.  This book has eight separate life stories.  Each story creatively pulls the reader in and holds their interest with ease.<br />It would be hard for me to pick out a favorite person in this book.  Each showed unbelievable strength and had the resilience to land on their feet; in spite of the curveballs that life kept throwing their way.  But I would have to say that Pearl touched my heart the most.  Auto accidents kept playing a central role in her life.  Born prematurely when her mother was hit by a car; subsequent accidents continued to haunt her life.  A less courageous person would have quit when doctors said she would never walk again.  She continued to fight and prove them wrong.  Pearl's spirit and tanacity were sheer inspiration.<br />The eight stories were well written, poignant and easily brought back memories of the 50's and 60's. Taking a glimpse into the lives of women that are honest and forthcoming about the events of their lives will touch different people in different ways.  Even though Pearl became my new heroine, I can guarantee that each woman will touch others in different ways.  They are the epitome of what we all should strive for.  Women share medical heartbreaks, infidelity, special needs children and their determination to charter their own destiny.  I highly recommend this one for women that need affirmation on the strength and courage that exists in all of us.  For the readers that already know this; it is a smooth, intriguing read.  Well done!	2004-03-17

If you only have a chance to read one or two good books a year, make this one of them!  With a gift for drawing a reader in from the first page, Ms French captivates, tantalizes, and delivers a story with ease.  From cover to cover, the action never ends.<br />Natasha is the seemingly quiet office manager for an investigation firm.  Her true dream is to be an investigator.  When given the opportunity to be a bodyguard, she jumps at the chance, hoping it will lead her into the investigator role.  Nobody is prepared for her madcap antics while protecting her man.  With wild abandonment, she charges full speed ahead, toting a gun and not afraid to draw it out.  I found myself laughing out loud with her zany behavior and total disregard for following the rules.  Her heart is in the right place, but her head keeps sending her off in another direction.  What a delightful character!  Add the dashing owner of the firm, Striker, and you have all the ingredients for an outstanding romance/mystery.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone that needs an escape.  Following the adventures of Natasha, readers will receive a hearty dose of humor, intrigue, and suspense with a little measure of sizzling sex thrown in.

Children's Gems for the Heart is a delightful read.  If you love kids and appreciate the unrehearsed words of wisdom that they speak, you will love this book.  Author Arlene S. Uslander has worked with children for many years as a teacher and has compiled this collection of her favorite quotes from her students.<br />I found myself laughing out loud while reading some of their profound, yet simple answers to life's most troubling questions.  When asked what they would wish for if they could have one wish, one third grader said she wished \\"when I told my mom and dad I wanted a baby brother, they hadn't listened to me.\\"  On a more serious side, they were asked questions regarding what they liked about the world and what they didn't like.  They discussed death, granparents, and AIDS.  Divorce was a popular discussion.  All in all, I was amazed by the maturity and ease that was apparent in the young students answers.  The simple answer given by one student, when asked what she wanted her parents to do, spoke volumes to me.  All she said was to \\"like each other more.\\"  Out of the mouths of babes!<br />I highly recommend this book for readers that need a chuckle as well as insight into the minds of our youngest members of society.  Their answers will surprise, educate, and amuse you.  This book is a treasure.<BR>(Reviewed for Denise's Pieces Book Reviews)	2004-02-21

It is a well-written compilation that will entertain and warm the hearts of readers.  Whether you are a believer in fate or think that random happenings are merely a simple set of circumstances, this book will capture your interest and give you plenty of food for thought.<br />We have all heard a story or two about someone being in the right place (or wrong place) at a specific time that resulted in circumstances that altered a life forever.  Do you believe that we get a &quot;nudge&quot; to go in a certain direction?  If you do, you will love this book.  If you don't, I can guarantee that you will be a believer of fate by the time you are done reading.  The stories are written in a short, easy to read style.  There are stories from different generations, during different wars, tales of people narrowly escaping death, and stories about the course of a life being changed by a split second decision.  There is a narrative account of a man that escaped the horror of 9/11.  There are stories about birth and death.  Those are just a few of the descriptive, anecdotal pieces you will find in this book.  The co-editors, to be truthful and accurate, have verified each story.<br />I found it to be very interesting and had a hard time putting this one down.  The stories stay with you long after you turn the last page.  There is such an assortment of incidents that people have recorded that it is almost impossible to deny that there is a force at work that is much bigger than we can see.  I would highly recommend this book for readers that are easily touched by the human spirit and all the oddities that happen which cannot be explained.	2004-02-02

THE EVERLASTING MOUNTAINS is the sequel to THORNS IN EDEN.  After reading THORNS IN EDEN, I could not wait for the next book.  It was well worth the wait.  Novelist Rita Gerlach is certainly one of the leading new authors of historical romance novels.  Her precise attention to the descriptive detail of the historical period adds life and depth to her stories.<br />The story takes place during the late 1700's in the area around Frederick, Maryland.  The colonists were faced with hard times due to Indian attacks, advancing British troops, and disease.  But none of that deterred the beautiful, English born Rebecah who left England to reunite with the dashing captain, Jack Nash.  Could their love survive the hardships of war as well as Rebecah's fate at the hands of a renegade group of warring Indians?  This story captures the imagination as well as the heart.  I found it to be very educational in Indian history and also the facts surrounding the colonist's struggles to stay free and independent of British rule.  Other issues of that era are evident in the story, such as slavery.  But it is the love story told with a tender touch that captured my attention.  Not since Rhett and Scarlett have I been so enamored with two characters.<br />This sequel stands on its own.  Even if a reader had not read THORNS IN EDEN, it would still be a fabulous read.

Although this book is for young adults, I found it to be a compelling, thought-provoking novel for any age.  This story is both creative and heart warming.<br />Dakar is the young male offspring of Torga, the wolf pack leader.  His father taught him many things about survival.  But life or death decisions must be made when four hunters try to kill the pack.  Dakar is forced to learn survival when he is separated from his family.  Unexplainable events occur which take Dakar on a journey of discovery with a wise and mysterious raven.<br />Many life lessons can be derived from this story.  Readers, young and old, will feel the adversity of a wolf's life as they are forced to endure in the wild.  Their survival depends on weather, humans, and availability of food.  Dakar's survival also depends on his capacity to learn trust.  The author's vast knowledge of wildlife, Indian traditins, and the Canadian mountains add to the realism of a story told from a wolf's perspective. I highly recommend this book for wildlife activists as well as anyone else that might have a soft spot in their heart for animals.  It is well written and captivating.  But most of all, it challenges the reader to view life from an animal's eyes.  A very powerful concept.	2003-12-15

Many social issues are thrust into the reader's subconscious without a lot of chest beating and demands to the issues.  It is well written and draws you in quickly yet quietly.<br />Timothy is the central character with a need to correct the injustices in the world.  His world appears small as he lives in a boarding house and owns none of the material things that many people think they need.  As the story unfolds, many well developed characters enter his life.  They are the down and out people of society.  Some live in homeless shelters, one is handicapped, few have jobs, but they all are drawn to the kindness of Timothy.  Even his landlord is drawn to him as she professes her self-image of being a Christian.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  She is the epitome of the narrow-minded hypocrite that tolerates very little from her fellow man.<br />I found this story to be interesting as well as enlightening.  Readers are foced to look inside themselves and evaluate what they feel and do in regards to the struggles of the less fortunate.  I personally enjoy a book that can bring me to new levels of understanding and compassion.  It is well written by an author that has true insight into the minds of his characters, and a winning writing style to bring it all together.  I can guarantee that his characters will stay in your heart and mind long after you put this book down.	2003-12-06

Not since Rhett and Scarlett have I been so enamored with two characters.<br />This sequel stands on it's own.  Even if a reader had not read Thorns in Eden, it would still be a fabulous read.  Both books combined would make an outstanding Hollywood movie.  The fast paced action will enthrall readers.  I had a hard time putting this one down.  I hope you keep on writing ms Gerlach; you are a natural.<BR>(reviewed for Denise's Pieces Book Reviews &amp; Intriguing Authors and Their Books)	2003-11-10

Although this is a fictional account, it could easily be a true story of life in America for two immigrants and their families.<br />The story begins with Jake, a Russian Jew and his friend Al, an Italian Catholic.  They both immigrated to the United States and become business partners as well as close friends.  Their families celebrate holidays of both religions together without a second thought to their differences in beliefs or cultural background.  Life is good until their invisible blinders are removed.  Al's daughter and Jake's son fall in love.  They want to be married and find that the biggest obstacle is the prejudice of their parents.  How can two sets of parents be so opposed to a marriage based solely on the fact that they worship in different ways?  They had never exposed hostility toward each other while maintaining a friendship of many years.  Could it be that when the situation became personal, they discovered that tolerance was a word used for situations occuring in someone else's inner circle?<br />Readers are easily brought into the lives of each character.  First time author, Toni Rich, has done a remarkable job of creating characters that are real and believable.  This novel takes you on a journey through three generations.  Each generation has its set of issues to deal with.  Whether it is prejudice against interfaith marriage or interracial couples and their children, it is all covered in this story.  The pain and the hardship of living in a society that does not accept differences can be a lonely road for those who have hehaviors or beliefs not tolerated.  Intolerance can rip families apart and cause irreparable damage.  It can also bind families together in ways they never thought possible.<br />I would highly recomment THEY STAY THE SAME for readers looking for an absorbing story that not only brings you back a few generations but also makes you question whether we have really come very far since the 50's.  It is a heartwarming story of the average family going through typical pain and joy.  There are social, moral, and racial issues woven together that makes one see members of their own family.  It also makes one relect on their own levels of tolerance.  The creative, surprise ending was the icing on this cake.  This is one book that should be on everybody's must read list.  Compelling and powerful are two words that come to my mind.<BR>(Reviewed for Denise's Pieces Book Reviews and Intriguing Authors and their Books)	2003-10-20

CHASING DEMONS is a fast-paced, smooth read that I found fascinating and impossible to put down.  It does what good fiction should do; entertain the reader from beginning to end.<br />Kendra Salvatori is married to the boss of a small crime organization.  After years of enduring Tony's brutality, she manages to escape.  The parallel stories that materialize are perfectly blended.  The gritty, violent side of organized crime is shown by Tony's determination to find Kendra by any means possible.  On the flip side, the reader follows Kendra's will to survive and to explore the new, gentle relationship with the man who saved her life.  The reader can easily feel many emotions due to strong character development and the unique writing style of the author.  This one has it all; mystery, suspense, romance, and a creative plot.<br />I challenge any reader to try to put this book down once they start to read it.  The action and drama build until the exhilarating conclusion that left me breathless.  Outstanding job Ms French.  I eagerly anticipate your next book.

I expected a slow paced fictional story about small town life.  First time author, Mary Erickson, has given readers an intriguing plot that gives an entire new meaning to &quot;small town life.&quot;  This story is full of twists and turns.  There is nothing slow paced about it.  The pages seem to turn themselves.<br />Melora is the typical, conservative librarian.  She is a spinster, taking care of her ailing, unappreciative mother.  Life had been moving along for her uneventfully for years.  The only exciting thing her town ever experienced was a murder fifteen years ago.  But all of that changed when Blake Johnson came back to town with a plan and more charm than principles.  He sets out to win the heart of a very inexperienced Melora.  Readers will be challenged at every turn to figure out where the story will go.  Does Blake have love or monetary gain in his heart?  Does he have anything to do with the murder so long ago?<br />I highly recommend this book.  It is well written with very strong characters that will either warm your heart or send a chill down your spine.  This book contains all of the components of a blockbuster novel; romance, murder, greed, and suspense.  What more could readers ask for?  I found this story to be very entertaining due to the author's creativity and apparent ease in weaving an exceptional tale.

Set during the early 1600's, it is a touching story of a little girl abandoned by her parents in the colonies.<br />At the age of 5, Alisha finds herself not only blind, but also alone.  She embarks on her own journey for survival.  She meets a kind gentleman, Dimetre.  He takes her into his life and home and provides for her.  Life is not easy in the early colonies, but add blindness and abandomment to the mix and it provides a heart-wrenching story.  I enjoyed the well-created characters that worked their way into my heart.<br />I would recommend this book for readers looking for a creative new take on early American life.

After reading her outstanding first romance novel, The Rebel's Pledge, I was anxious to see if she could maintain the high standard she had set.  I was not disappointed.  Thorns in Eden is an exceptional tale, told by a woman with a phenomenal gift to tell a great story.  Her keen attention for detail enhances her superb imagination.  She makes her characters come to life and the reader feels as if they are transported back into another century.<br />The year is 1773.  There are two major events happening simultaneously.  The colonists are tired of paying taxes to England and want their freedom.  England is made of people that are loyal to the king, and some that have the vision of a free America.  The colonists are fighting the Indians, disease, and the British soldiers.  English rulers are imprisoning anybody that shows sympathy for the patriots.  The alone would make an interesting story.  But this is a ROMANCE novel and there the  interwoven love stories that will delight and hold the interest of any reader.<br />John Nash is the patriot that is fighting for America's freedom.  Rebecah is the beautiful, yet poor, orphan that captures his heart.  Can this star-crossed couple ever find happiness and each other with an ocean separating them?  Can they survive the pre-revolutionary chaos in both of their worlds?  I'm a reviewer that never gives away too much of a plot.  I will say that this one is a must read.  It is well written and creative; yet educational.  I cannot wait to read the sequel to this book, The Everlasting Mountains.

My short review cannot possibly do it justice.  I can honestly say that Ms Gerlach has the ability to mesmerize readers with fast-moving action, gripping intrigue, and larger than life characters.<br />Set against the backdrop of England and the American colonies during the late 1600's, readers are taken on a breathtaking ride of adventure with Matthew Hale.  He is a traitor to King James and the story opens with him facing his own execution in a prison in England.  His life is spared, but he is sold into slavery to the highest bidder in Maryland.  There is never a lull in the story as he sails from England to the colonies.  He manages to free himself from slavery but his life takes an unexpected turn when he meets and falls in love with the captivating Laura.  Subsequent trips to England add more spice to Matthew's escapades.<br />Readers will be delighted with the masterful way the author weaves her tale of love, honor and the aspects of good versus evil.  Matthew must battle with pirates on the open seas, unsavory landowners and unscrupulous followers of Kind James.  The story is enhanced by the author's attention to detail and historical facts of that era.<br />I was so engrossed in the story that I was shocked to see 454 pages come to an end so quickly.  The pages seemed to melt away as I devoured this book.  I would highly recommend this book for lovers of great romance/historical novels.  This one is well worth the time and money.  Great job Ms Gerlach.  I eagerly await your next novel.	2003-07-08

She is a master at writing a captivating story about average people.  BJOYFL is a fast paced, easy read and pulls the reader in on the very first chapter.  The author creates quirky characters that are both endearing and entertaining.  Written with a lot of dialogue, one becomes enmeshed in the day-to-day lives of the characters without having to read page after page of descriptive prose.  <br />Valerie, the main character, decides to go to college for the first time in her mid 30's.  Life is not simple or easy for her.  She struggles with many of life's dilemmas, such as finding love and happiness.  There is a little bit of Valerie in all of us, which makes her so easy to relate to.  I highly recommend this book for readers that want to escape.  Becoming part of Valerie's life is sometimes delightful, and sometimes sad, but the reader keeps cheering for her from the sidelines.	2003-07-03

It begins with the introduction of two high school students.  Syd is a bright, sensitive guy.  John is the football jock, as well as a bully.  What transpires between the bully and the victim leads to violence and many years of soul searching for Syd.  The story then fast-forwards to forty-five years later.<br />There is a meeting between John and Syd.  Their memories of what happened and why are vastly different.  Syd still sees himself as the victim and John feels that Syd was a wimp that would have not been picked on if only he would have stuck up for himself.  Joh challenged Syd with an entirely different way to evaluate his life.<br />Could there actually be some truth to the idea that Syd played a part in his own victimization?  Could it be a fact that bullies and victims are co-conspirators in the tragic cycle of violence?  I found that to be an interesting concept.  Together, they come up with a plan to study the issues regarding the bully/victim syndrome.  In a private school setting, ten students take part in a year long study to see if some will naturally become the aggressive ones, and others to be the passive.  Will they be able to work out situations without adult guidance?<br />This is a very creative story that will leave readers with more knowledge of human behavior and many things to ponder.  I enjoyed this book very much.  The characters were so well defined that it almost read like a non-fiction.  I highly recommend this book for teachers, parents, and counselors.  However, I think it should be a required read for adolescents.  It could help them grasp the basic tools needed to co-exist in this society.  With school violence at an all-time high in this country, we need to look at books like this, which provide fresh insight to old problems.	2003-07-02

The author and illustrator have combined their talents to create a truly enjoyable story.  I read this book a few times and found it to be heartwarming and creatively written to capture the love that exists between grandparents and their grandchildren.  The verses were both humorous and touching; the illustrations were beautiful.<br />I decided to put this book to the real test.  Since I am the grandmother of three, all under the age of six, I knew I could assemble a captive audience.  It took some time to get through the first read with the grandkids.  They kept giggling and interrupting to reminisce about the times they had done similar things in the book with their grandpa and me.  By the fifth time they asked me to reread the story, I knew we had found a new favorite.  They loved the book and I loved the bonding moments we were sharing by reading it.  That alone would guarantee my highest recommendation.  THAT'S WHAT GRANDPARENTS ARE FOR is a wonderful new addition on my bookshelf and I am sure it will be read over and over again.	2003-01-19

For Paul Blais, he and his family have been dealing with it since June 25, 1996.  Paul's son was in the barracks at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia when a terrorist bomb killed 19 American servicemen.  At first he thought his son was among the 19.  Days later he found out that his son survived, but had suffered a traumatic brain injury.  While the rest of the world got caught up in the next big news story, Paul and his family entered a foreign world trying to understand the magnitude of so many unknowns associated with TBI.<br />So many of us are guilty of losing interest in a news event a few days after the news hype has died down.  We hear a number associated with the deceased and wounded and give little thought to the decimated lives of the victims, or their families.  After reading this book, I will never again hear of a terrorist attack without shedding tears for survivors, deceased, and their families.  Terrorism is such a cowardly act!<br />Paul has created a well-written, poignant account of his only son.  This is an honest, thought provoking and indredibly moving story of a young man's will to survive and a father's love for his son.  I can guarantee that readers will be as engrossed in this story as I was.  It was impossible to put this book down.<br />It is easy for me to highly recommend this book.

Epilepsy is still a vastly misunderstood anomaly of the brain that plagues many people.

Whatever the future holds for Jarrett, he has already managed to touch more people with his courage and his Joy Cart than most of us will ever accomplish.  <br />This book is an absolute treasure.  I would highly recommend it.  I would especially recommend it for anyone that has forgotten what life is really about.  Jarrett's life is all about caring, love, sharing and paying it forward.  What a wonderful legacy he has created.  <br />I truly expect to see this book hit the best seller list.	2002-09-05
US	41775807	RSLVVJF9E8VHW	1591290201	865652448	Sock Monkey Blues	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Outstanding!!	Although I don't usually read mysteries, the favorable reviews grabbed my interest.  I also had to find out what a Sock Monkey was.<br />I am glad that I took the time to read this one.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I loved the character, Joe Box.  As he found himself in one mess after another, his dry wit and sarcastic sense of humor had me laughing many times.  Yet, there was a vulnerable side to Joe that just made him loveable.<br />While reading this book, I kept thinking that it would make a great movie.  I highly recommend this book.  It has plenty of mystery and suspense to keep you guessing, with just the right touch of humor added in.<br />This one is well worth the time and money.	2002-08-16

It was a pleasant surprise to see that this book was much more. Although I enjoy reading about the strange things that happen to him, this book made me see him in a different light.<br />Even being psychic doesn't help John Edward know what his future will bring.  I thoroughly enjoyed his upward journey of getting his first book published and then promoted.  After recently getting my own book published, it was so amusing to me to see that he goes through the same angst that all writers go through.  Keeping an eye on Amazon ratings, writing because an unknown force compelled him to do so, and crashing when a bad review comes.  This is so familiar to me, yet I didn't expect it from a person that I thought it all came easy to.<br />Another added surprise was his association with some famous people that had crossed over.  Readings that were done for people he didn't know,  produced some very interesting results and were quite entertaining.<br />I would highly recommend this book for all John Edward fans.  Even if you are not a fan, it is a very interesting read.	2002-05-28

The Grass Dance is just that type of book.  Laurel Johnson has shared her innermost feelings.  She has created a personal journey that allows the reader to go along with her.  Her life was spiraling downward into a pit of darkness.  She knew she was lost, but couldn't find her way back into the light.<BR>The love of family and friends was not enough.  She needed to find her own path.  It came about in a most unusual way.<br />This story is beautifully written and has a message for all.  It is told with quiet dignity and honesty.  The reader quickly feels like a part of the author's life due to her outstanding use of poetry, imagery, and personally shared experiences.  I feel as if I danced the Grass Dance with her.<br />I highly recommend this book.  It filled me with a renewed sense of hope and optimism.  I plan to share my copy with many others.	2002-05-17

The only way to do this is through knowledge.  I am thankful to the authors that bring their vast knowledge to the reading public.  <br />This book is a masterpiece, filled with fascinating information and references.  Barbara Spring has done an outstanding job of bringing her love of the Great Lakes to others.  I have been watching the return of the bald eagles to New England. What a wonderous sight to see them soaring overhead after an absence of many years.  This was made possible by active ecologists and hard working nature enthusiasts.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about saving the Great Lakes. I feel that this book should be a required read for science classes.	2002-04-15
US	41775807	R3HTJXDFQL8NIQ	1591291607	346220112	Such is Tragedy	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Beautifully Written	While reading this book, I was captivated by the depth of feeling that each poem brought.  Someone with many years of life experiences could have written this compassionate, heart-felt poetry.  However, I am aware that Rebekah Hurth is young in years; yet, she possesses a level of maturity in her writing that left me speechless.  Through her poetry, Rebekah allows the reader to share in her pain, confusion and isolation.  The imagery is powerful and moves the reader to tears.  As the poems progress, one can begin to feel her emerging ray of hope through her strong faith.  I know that we will be hearing much more from this talented, young writer in the future.  This is a deeply emotional read and I highly recommend it.	2002-04-07

It is about time that someone tackled the issues that caregivers face.  It can often be a lonely and confusing time.

I thought it was very enjoyable and I especially appreciated the comparison of Susan's life and a &quot;soap opera.&quot;  Well-written and entertaining.	2002-02-13

When Barbie's father is diagnosed with cancer, he reaches out to her for support.  Their past has been a rocky road, but Barbie rises to the occasion.  <BR>While serving as his primary caregiver, she is shocked by the things that she learns on this journey.  Making sure that her father receives the best medical care is over-shadowed by the knowledge she acquires on elder-care issues.  <BR>Her story is a tribute to her father as well as a source of information for the reader.  Issues are addressed that we should all be aware of.  Long-term nursing care, medicaid, dying with dignity, and many more issues are put out there for the reader to ponder, digest and hopefully become educated to.
