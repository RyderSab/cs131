APRIL MOON is an anthology with an interesting concept - three stories taking place in April 1803 under an April Moon.  <br /> <br />Sailor's Moon by Merline Lovelace is a spicy sexy tale about the widow Lady Sarah Stanton. Her debts have led her to be engaged to Captain Sir James Lowell, a nasty and self-serving man. Now traveling on his ship, she realizes her mistake, but finds she is unfortunately under his control. The ship is taken over and boarded by American captain, Richard Blake, who has come to free his crewmembers who were taken by Sir Lowell and committed to his service. Sir Lowell forces Sarah to use her womanly wiles on Captain Blake in an effort to kill him. This backfires in the most delightful way. This story moves quickly and is a fun romp on the sea. Ms. Lovelace introduces sexy characters and fun villains.  <br /> <br />Susan King's White Fire is a smugglers tale and takes place on a moonlit Scottish coast. Jenny Colvin, searching for proof to halt her father's hanging, is stopped by the mysterious and brooding Sir Simon Lockhart. Once in love with him until he left abruptly four years ago, she finds she must turn to him to help save her father, aware that only this once-daring smuggler could save her father from the gallows. In love with Jock Colvin's daughter Simon is determined to have her forgive him for disappearing without a trace. Susan King weaves a sweet and engaging tale set against the Scottish coast and the light of that mysterious April moon.  <br /> <br />The Devil's Own Moon by Miranda Jarrett introduces us to Harry Burton, the Earl of Atherwall. On a bet he dresses as a highwayman to hijack a coach. Of course the coach he holds up is Sophie's, his long lost childhood love. Sophie now finds she needs an escort to her governess job and Harry is the only one to do the job.  <br /> <br />The Devil's Own Moon is a fun adventure, and is both humorous and engaging.  <br /> <br />All in all APRIL MOON is an extremely enjoyable light readby three talented writers!  <br /> <br />	2004-11-14

What is it about the Templar Knights that mystify us as readers of the historical romance genre? Is it that they are monks, or that they have taken a vow of celibacy? Perhaps it is that they are religious warriors that have taken up the sword for a cause. Whatever the reason for our great interest, author Marsha Canham takes us directly into the heart of this fascination with Templar Knight, Ciaran Tamberlane. Ciaran becomes disillusioned during his journey into the Holy Land, as innocent lives are slaughtered before him and everything he believes to be true about the Templar Knights is carelessly tossed aside by the heartless and merciless Knights he fights with. He can no longer watch the brutal killings and follows his own heart abandoning his sword and retreating into self-imposed exile back to England. As a reader, you can decide what you find so interesting about this sort of character. It definitely taps into our interest of the mysteryious Templar Knights as historical romance readers.  <br /> <br />Amaranth de Langois (Amie), has been married before to an old and abusive man, and upon being sold again to the highest marriage bidder, this time to the brutal Lord Odo, she has reached her limit of abuse and has decided to fight back by attempting to kill him. Amie, fleeing her vengeful husband, finds herself on Ciaran's land. Brutally attacked and wounded she is brought back to his castle and is cared for by Marak, a healer who nurtures her back to health.  <br /> <br />As these two tormented characters come together (Ciaran and Amie), their attraction is almost tangible. Author Marsha Canham builds up this story through excellent character development, not just with the central hero and heroine, but also with the secondary characters. This adds a dimension not often seen in historical romances where usually the focal point is on the hero and heroine.  <br /> <br />If you like intelligent historical romance that are filled with passion, action, and interestingcharacters then MY FOREVER LOVE is the book for you.  <br /> <br />Tara Green	2004-11-14

Another sequel to the outstanding THE DUMONT BRIDE by Terri Brisbin, THE COUNTESS BRIDE picks up with Catherine de Severin, the sister of William Royce de Severin and the pawn used to control him. Now, Catherine resides with Christian Dumont and his wife Emalie. These wonderful characters from THE DUMONT BRIDE appear again in this 3rd book in the series and revisiting them in this story is a nice tie-in. Catherine de Severin sees no future for herself. Her memory is muddled and her shadowed past haunts her. Her childhood love, Geoffrey Dumont, and young brother to Christian stands to inherit a powerful title and land. Now he seeks a bride and unfortunately Catherine is unfit. As his bride selections are brought before them his heart and mind turn again and again to his true love, Catherine. As she heads to the nunnery to commit herself to God, Geoffrey has other plans, as he sees her life is in danger and throws caution to the wind to save her. Against the wishes of his family he marries her. Still, their troubles are not over. Catherine again finds herself a pawn of high powers that have controlled her life. In many ways, this characters loss of innocence at the hands of others brings more than a touch of sadness to this story. As a reader who read each book in this series with a lot of time in between the next, I highly recommend reading these books in succession. THE COUNTESS BRIDE had me referring to THE DUMONT BRIDE, which I hadn't read in well over two years ago time and time again. To thoroughly enjoy these books they definitely should be read together and would not do well as stand alone stories. THE COUNTESS BRIDE continues in the style of Terri Brisbin's other stories, which are consistently well delivered, sensual with a strong enough dose of historical backdrop to satisfy most discriminating historical romance readers.  <br /> <br />Tara Green	2004-11-14

In Virginia Henley's much awaited new release, UNDONE, we meet two lovely sisters, Elizabeth and Maria. Both sisters are equally lovely but their mother Bridget favors Maria, the oldest, and sets her very ambitious sights on her. Since they are poor and Bridge comes from a theatrical background at first she trains both daughters to be actresses. As their prospects change, Bridget realizes she can set her sites higher and decides to enter society and present her daughters. To do this her husband must borrow huge sums of money, sell their family home, and present an air of wealth.     Elizabeth, who had met John Campbell quite by chance before moving to London, meets him again in society. They are drawn to each other and there is a very passionate connection between these two characters. Elizabeth, constantly overseen by her very dominate and controlling mother, finds herself maneuvered from party to party, and giving up lovely dresses to Maria, her sister, in her mother's effort to marry her off. Elizabeth, whose natural and genuine appeal shines through, befriends Charlie a very wealthy heiress and her beau Will, a friend of John's. As they plan many secret \\"couple rendezvous\\" events John and Elizabeth become closer. Meanwhile, Bridget continues to plan her daughters' future and as John leaves for Scotland and official business plans for Elizabeth to marry the very wealthy Duke of Hamilton. Realizing that John will never marry her, and the prospects of her family lie in her hands...she marries the Duke.     This story is lovely. Virginia Henley has reigned in her fiery pen to tantalize us with a subtler sensual tale than her previous works. Still filled with the steamy scenes we all expect from Ms. Henley, this story is presented to us at a slower pace, allowing us to get to know and care about the characters. Elizabeth's delightful innocence and growth into a strong woman who knows what she wants is an empowering tale for anyone to read who knows the progression from girl to womanhood well - and the trials and tribulations that shape a persons character.     UNDONE is not be missed!	2004-11-14

Prepare yourself for a violent ride in Angela Knight's latest book, THE FOREVER KISS. This romantic title actually yields a gritty vampire tale that chills you to the bone.     Valerie Chase's family was brutally murdered by a group of vampires when she was a young child. Her mother was savagely raped and killed, and her father's life sucked from him. Only herself and her younger sister survived, thanks to Cade McKinnon, another vampire on the scene who refused to kill her, even though his vampire master commanded that he do so.     Years later, Valerie is visited in her dreams by the man she knows as Cowboy. The Cowboy is her hero, who protects her as a child and later makes love to her.     As Edward Ridgeont, the diabolical vampire master, begins his pursuit of Valerie again and draws her to his mansion, Cade steps in to protect her. Though not as strong as his old vampire master, he is determined to protect Valerie.     This story is intriguing, however if you are looking for an erotica romance, this really isn't the book for you. Drawing away from the initial sensual nature this story begins with, this book is riddled with very gloomy and very graphic violence. Cade, the hero of the story, also has sex (I wouldn't say makes love though he seems to satisy the lady well enough) to an other woman and Valerie \\"sees\\" this in her dreams. For those of us who like monogamous stories once the hero and heroine meet, this is a real turn off.     For those of you who love vampire stories, this one is a fantastic one. The paranormal elements in this book are top notch. Angela Knight is an extremely profienct and talented writer.     So looking at this book from several angles, it fails as a \\"feel good\\" romance and even strips the fun out of the sensual nature however as a paranormal story it's one of the best I've read in a while. Not one to enjoy gratitious violence I think I'll read something a bit lighter next. I would not want to read several stories like this in succession. This is just a personal preference.     Warning -- extremely graphic violence and strong sexual content	2004-11-14

He finds himself on her journey with her and their destinies intertwined as they try to reach her brother. Through their journey Braedon self awareness grows as he discovers his special powers, which have given him the name The Hunter, come from a source even he was not aware of until now.  <br /> <br />Tina St. John introduces us to a new world in her most recent release, HEART OF THE HUNTER. Part fairy tale, part fantasy we meet shape shifters, Templar Knights, and men at odds with each other as they stop at nothing to find the stones of the Dragon Chalice. This is the start of a brand new medieval series. The \\"Dragon Chalice\\" series will consist of four books, connected through an ongoing quest for the legendary chalice and four precious stones.  <br /> <br />Though dubbed a historical romance, this book has very strong elements of fantasy and might be more appropriately placed in that category as it's leading sub-genre.  <br /> <br />This book was a delight to read -- both sensual, adventurous, and original. It's not your every day romance and Tina St. John has taken some unexpected chances that pay off, delivering a very satisfying story.  <br /> <br />Tara Green	2004-11-14

ONE KISS FROM YOU has made me totally intrigued and eager to read more of Christina Dodd's books.     The first few chapters of this book did not hook me, which proves one should always be patient when reading because they just might miss a delightful treat if they put the book down too soon.     This is the 2nd in a series by Ms. Dodd, and I have not read the first book. Eleanor de her cousin, Madeline, has sent Lacy to take her place in a betrothal to Remington Knight. Knight, an American, who has won Madeline from her father in a card game has a sinister plan of revenge against the de Lacy family. When Eleanor arrives Remington is drawn to her and is passionately attracted to her. The feeling is mutual and Eleanor, at first timid and meek, finds herself empowered in her new role as a Duchess and the subject of Remington's intense fascination. As their wedding arrives, Remington finds he has been duped and their relationship changes from one of need and revenge to one of love and necessity.     I found this story very sexy, fun, and fast moving after I passed the first several Chapters. Both characters were not what I initially expected, in particular Eleanor, and she proved to have some surprises up her sleeve.     I'm eagerly anticipating reading the 1st in this series now, Scandalous Again. ONE KISS FROM YOU is a delight and I strongly encourage you to pick up a copy.

Setting - Cumberland, England 1807  <br /> <br />Iantha Kethley is a young woman who has been the victim of a violent gang rape just before her season. The rapists are \\"gentlemen\\" and therefore apprehending them initially proves difficult since social class limits questioning suspects unless there is evidence to justify such questioning. All Iantha knows of their identity is that they wore red scarlet masks, and smelled of a distinctive alcohol and tobacco. Because of the stigma associated with this sort of crime placed on a woman in this day and age, she retreats within herself and accepts she will not marry. One afternoon while in the hills painting she encounters Rob Armstrong otherwise known as Baron Duncan. He assists her during the snowstorm they find themselves in and takes her back to his castle. Once Rob is able to return Iantha to her family, he offers for her due to the improper nature of her staying the night at his home unattended. He sets it upon himself to help Iantha and also help himself, since he still grieves for the family he lost several years ago.  <br /> <br />The gang rape itself is not described in any graphic detail. As readers we only get a glimpse into what occurred. The actual motivation for the crime and why these men target Iantha is unclear throughout the book. There is talk of drugs, and a wild crowd but it would have been interesting to learn more about these seedy characters to add suspense and drama to this story. The story itself is more about Iantha's healing and her realization of herself as a strong woman.  <br /> <br />Ms. Patricia Frances Rowell treats the subject of rape quite compassionately and guides us through Iantha's journey to healing and finding her true passionate nature and emotions. With the help of Rob, Iantha finds love, acceptance and eventually strength in dealing with her past. There are some misuses of language that do not appear to be true to the time period and some rough patches to Ms. Rowell's writing style, in particular in the beginning of the story but in the end Ms. Rowell delivers a very satisfying story.  <br /> <br />Tara Green	2004-11-14

The men of the Bastion Club buy a home for their club in a quiet neighborhood and Tristan oversees the preparations. He first encounters Leonora Carling in her gardens. At first he watches her, admiring her from afar, and then meets her and finds himself immediately immersed in a mystery. <br />Leonora Carling, a woman past marrying at the age of 26 years old, is both lovely and intelligent. Someone has been trying to break into her home and other homes that share a wall in the neighborhood. Tristan and Leonora, with a common goal of catching the culprit find themselves tracking leads together. In doing so, their fiery attraction sparks and ignites. <br />The story takes a turn as the couple explores their newfound attraction and their affair finds themselves in all sorts of compromising situations - most notably on a Mahoney desk! Tristan is in hot pursuit to have Leonora as his wife, his \\"Lady Chosen\\", however she resists and refuses his offer of marriage. She long ago had set aside any plans for marriage and cherishes her independence and freedom to act as she wishes. Surrounded by academic men who rely on her to run the household, she has become set in her ways and marriage ideas put to rest long ago - until Tristan. But Tristan is not one to not get what he wants, and he wants Leonora. <br />The story clearly jumps from a mystery to a passionate affair quite abruptly. The focus of the story pivoting suddenly in this manner is almost like reading two stories in one. Once the love affair consummates the mystery of the break-ins, so crucial in the first few chapters, falls to the wayside. Ms. Lauren's deftly picks up soon after, but a meshing of these two storylines or at least a more subtle turn would be my only complaint to this wonderfully entertaining story. <br />Stephanie Lauren's has written a sizzling and sexy story of passion and love. The characters jump off the pages, and their attraction undeniable. I'm looking forward to the next in this series, due on September 2003, entitled A GENTLEMAN'S HONOR which will tell the story of Anthony Blake, Viscount Torrington and his bride. <br />**Cynster fans will be surprised and delighted to see a brief appearance by Devil Cynster himself in LADY CHOSEN.	2003-08-31

I believe this has to do primarily with Cecelia Holland being a truly gifted story teller. No matter where she took the story, I wanted to follow. <br />Corban's growth from a young boy to manhood, is swift as he is faced with the total destruction of his family. His connection with his sister leads him on his journey to save her, where he meets all sorts of people who will become important in his life.<br />The one part I did not enjoy in this book, was the telepathic connection with his sister. This book is rich in historical detail and I feel this detracted from the richness of the story.	2003-08-31
US	50078997	R1ZDJOTUXG209P	0821773437	581897164	A Twilight Clear	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Sleeper Romance	Set in Nottingham, England in 1164, this tale picks up after three years have passed since Willian and his wife, Catherine have wed. William de Macon, battle-scarred and tired, is finally returning home to his wife and daughter, who he hardly knows. However he brings with him a secret he must keep from his wife. In tow is the King, Henry Platnagenet's, pregnant mistress. In order to protect her, he sets the mistress up close to where his wife lives so he might protect her through the winter from Welsh spies. As he conceals the woman's identity from his wife Catherine de Macon and in doing so casts doubt on whether the woman is his own mistress. <BR>While I enjoyed Linda Cook's writing style rich in historical detail with good secondary characters, both real and fictional, it left gaps in time and development. William and Catherine share a daughter together yet hardly know each other. Budding passion developed over their first initial weeks together, but three years later they are virtually strangers. William is a worn-down warrior, scarred and limping, his glory days seem past. <br />The joy of seeing William as a doting father, and also as a fiercely protective loving husband still makes this a hero worth reading about. Catherine, a strong and devoted wife, also helps hold this story together. Though lacking in action and punch, this is still a good read with a definite uniqueness in its presentation.	2003-08-31

Does it get any better? <BR>Mistaken for a thief known as the \\"magical Megs\\", Princess Tatiana is held prisoner by the Pirate Lord Cairn McTavish. He's convinced she is this infamous thief and also lover to his rival and is intent on breaking her to his will and using her as a pawn to seek his revenge. Though we know Tatiana is a Princess and Cairn was once a pirate, we just aren't sure where Tatiana is from or when Cairn was ever a pirate. It's ok though because this story is so FUN! From the first chapter I was game for the wonderful ride Lois Greiman takes us on in THE PRINCESS AND THE PIRATE. This light book was a wonderful read that teases the reader by knocking out our hero just before they consummate their relationship. It was both amusing and entertaining. This book is a gem if you are looking for fun and silliness. You will find no heavy historical content however, so don't choose this story if that is what you are looking for. This one is PURE enjoyment from start to finish and a good break from more heavy storylines you may be reading.	2003-07-08

Book 4 of the Malloren Series by Jo Beverley is the steamiest yet! <BR>Rosamunde Overton, married to an old gentleman unable to have children, must have an heir to rescue her state from the greedy hands of his zealot nephew. In order to do so she decides to request payment from Lord Brand Malloren who she rescues drugged on the road. <br />He complies willingly and the pages set fire! This book is sultry and seductive and has a distinctly earthly feel to it than other Jo Beverley's novels in this series. I enjoyed this book more than all the others, due to liking the character of Brand Malloren best, who is a good-natured and kind man, but doesn't hold back on loving his lady. <br />Rosamunde is scarred from an early childhood accident. To not show this scar and to also not reveal her identity she wears a mask throughout the seduction and Brand never knows who she is...until much later. <br />The story is very rich and Jo Beverley hits her high in her infamous Malloren Series with Book 4. This is the one book in the Malloren series still out of print. It should be reissued soon. Until then your local library or a used bookstore should have it. Warning though, Jo Beverley's books are collectibles so buying it used you could pay a steep price.	2003-06-30

Finally Rothgar meets his match in Book 5 of the Malloren Series. <BR>Taking Diana Westmount, the Countess of Arradale, to London under the command of the King. Rothgar who has fought demons with the murder of his baby sister by his mother, has controlled himself in the effort to not carry on the insanity bloodlines he believes runs through him. However, he is unable to resist Diana, a strong female character almost unheard of Georgian England at this time. <br />Diana, the cousin of Rosamunde (Book 4  SECRETS OF THE NIGHT) is introduced in Book 4, while we have known Rothgar from Book 1. He is the force behind the Malloren Family and to read the story that goes with the man finally is great fun. <br />This book might be classified as an anti-climax in some respects. Now, Jo Beverley is a masterful writer and all her books are outstanding. DEVILISH however was an almost dreaded read. Could this be that the reader places Rothgar on a pedestal like a hovering mother, and disapproves of all matches? Could this be because it seems to signify the end of the Malloren series? Not to worryJo Beverley will release WINTER OF FIRE this fall to the relief of many fans Im sure. <br />If you like spicy Georgian-era romances, there is no one who writes these better than Jo Beverley. Strong advisement is to start with Book 1 though, not Book 5. <br />Long live the Mallorens!	2003-06-30

Portia St. Claire's brother, Oliver is an addicted gambler who loses their estate. In order to try to pay off the debt, Portia and her brother travel to London to ask for help from a family friend. <BR>Bryght Malloren, 2nd in line to the Malloren Fortune is on family business to attempt to retrieve a damning letter in the home of the Earl of Walgrove. He finds instead the short, fiery Portia St. Claire instead who holds a pistol on him and demands he leaves. Sparks fly immediately between these two. <br />This good is interesting on several levels. First it very accurately portrays the addiction to gambling, the inability to control it, and the dangers of bidding beyond your means. Secondly, and completely unassociated the characters and secondary characters each hold their own weight, are interestingly created and weaved into the story. Unlike the 1st Malloren book (MY LADY NOTORIOUS), Rothgar, the head of the family does not overshadow Bryght who in his own right is sensual, intelligent and handsome. Portia, though not a traditionally beautiful woman has such a fiery nature, though perhaps a bit prudish and still, is a nontraditional heroine. <br />Though Portia is actually auctioned in a Brothel at one point, for her virginal qualities this book is much lighter on explicit sex then it's predecessor and indeed the story seems much richer. However, perhaps it is that you truly began to care about this family. And this being book 2, you get to know and like them a lot more!	2003-06-30

This story tells the tale of Lady Elfled (Elf) Malloren and Fortitude Ware, Earl of Walgrave. Both characters are introduced in the previous books so their personalities are not unknown to us. Fort is the sister to Chastity Ware (Book 1) and Elf is the sister to the Malloren brothers.<br />Elf decides she would like some adventure and proceeds to attend a masquerade as the French \\"Lisette\\". She stumbles upon a treasonous plot and finds her adventure to be more than she bargained for. None other than the Earl of Walgrave is part of it. Fort, introduced to us in Book 1 (MY LADY NOTRIOUS) as a somewhat harsh brother to Chastity, including slapping her in the face for her supposed indiscretion, is still quite harsh and cold. To protect Elf (who he only knows as Lisette) he takes her back to his house and ties her up, after Elf refuses his seductive advances. To complicate matters Fort hates all things Malloren, and blames them for the death of his father, or more accurately causing him to shoot his own father dead.<br />This story is quite enjoyable, and Fort eventually finding release from his guilt in the arms of Elf explained a lot about his motivations and character.	2003-06-30

This is the first romance novel I have read where the hero spends at least 3/4 of the book sleeping with another woman. <BR>Jo Beverley strains the boundaries of political correctness in AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE, her most controversial story I have read to date. There is no denying Ms. Beverley is a master storyteller and perhaps because of this political incorrectness she delivers a powerfully fresh stage for her story. <br />Eleanor Chivenham is drugged by her manipulative brother and raped by an equally drugged Lord Delaney. Lord Delaney hazed into the brutal act and not quite having his wits about him completes the deed but comes back the next day to find out exactly what happened. Upon meeting Eleanor planning to jump to her death, and understanding a child might come from this act, concocts a story that it was actually his twin brother Nicholas Delaney who stole her maidenhood. A marriage is arranged, and Eleanor and Nicholas are soon married. <br />She quickly discovers that it was not Nicholas who raped her, but his brother. Nicholas, a charming and handsome man is soon off spending time with his mistress. Serving his country, Nicholas is actually involved in a plot to foil the mistress who is involved in Napoleonic activities. Eleanor finds she is with child and also that she loves her dreadfully neglectful and cheating husband. Nicholas, knowing he will be gone most of the time, has surrounded her with his Company of Rogues, a group of handsome and dashing young men to act as her protectors and escorts. <br />The hero Nicholas is not one I liked much at all. His sleeping with this mistress for the greater good of the country and at the expense of his marriage is hard for any woman to swallow I think. The very idea that this romance began in a rape, although not by the \\"hero\\" is still distasteful and gives a dark shadow over the entire story. That said, the story is incredibly engaging and tightly woven from start to finish and is a very entertaining read.

If that doesn't grab your attention, the story will. Mary Reed McCall has written an emotional story of innocence stolen and how love can be found in the depths of despair. <BR>Sold at 15 to Lord Draven, Fiona Bryne's innocence is stolen from her and she is turned into \\"The Crimson Lady\\". She becomes known as a notorious courtesan and thief, her escapades legendary, her sensual techniques known far and wide. <br />Braiden de Cantor, a dishonored knight, who coincidently happens to also be Draven's nephew, seeks her in order to rescue his foster sister who has been sold into prostitution. Finding Fiona, he forces her to accompany him to her former band of outlaws in order to teach him how to first survive by thievery in order to raise money to rescue his foster sister and then to take him to the stewes to retrieve his foster sister. <br />Fiona (called Giselle as the crimson lady) is a deeply emotionally scarred woman. At the hands of Draven she experienced a powerless and debilitating weakness one might feel when under the power of another. She was never allowed to give freely of her emotion or affections and believes she will never have those things she wants most. <br />Braeden is a warm and sensitive man who falls under Fiona's spell. Her beauty matches her legendary reputation but her demeanor does not. Braeden sees past the facade to the true woman beneath. <br />There are several very emotional scenes in this book, one being where Braeden and Fiona first make love. As a warm rain falls, symbolically cleansing Fiona of her past violations with Draven, they make love, and a deep affection develops between these two characters. <br />There are plot stumbles, as there are too many coincidences to make the story entirely plausible. The writing at times is not developed enough to fully engage the reader, however the story is a powerful one. Ms. McCall has written an original story for romance readers, with more depth than one might be used to. Mary Reed McCall, who has several books under belt, seems to still be a developing talent. This book is both enjoyable and original.	2003-06-20

This 1st book in the Malloren Series by Jo Beverley includes gender bending, cross-dressing, seduction, and adventure. What a combination! Though the first quarter of the book is slow-moving if you are patient you will see it is only the beginning of a very multi-layered and enjoyable tale. <br />We are first introduced to Cyn Malloren as his carriage is hijacked by Lady Chastity Ware dressed a highwayman. Desperate to help her widowed sister and baby escape the man intent on taking her child from her, she resorts to thievery in order to aid her sister's plight.<br />However, Cyn is bored and wishing for adventure and is a willing victim. Immediately noting \\"Charlie\\" is not truly a man he is intrigued and willing to go along for the ride.<br />We are introduced several times to the head of the Malloren Family, Rothgar, a charismatic man who is both bold and one we find dipping in the snuff quite a bit! What might be a major flaw in the story is the very overshadowing of the hero Cyn by his more intriguing brother. There is no fault in the character build up of Lady Chastity who proves to be both passionate and a victim of her father's cruelty, however Cyn comes across as a much lighter version of his brother. Rothgar had a previous tryst (although fairly innocent) with Lady Chastity and there seems to actually be a rather deep connection between the two of them. <br />The much talked about LADY NOTORIOUS, the 1st book in Jo Beverley's Malloren Series, was not at all as I expected. Perhaps a book and series with such a reputation must perform immediate miracles or one is disappointed. Rest assured, this book picks-up<BR>tempo quite swiftly mid-way and was indeed a joy to read.  The sensual scenes becoming quite explicit, and due to the beginning being a rather slow and innocent tale, you can see that Ms. Beverley has merely played you into her talented hands. The story engulfs you in it's fun, depth, and layers. <br />The 2nd book in the Malloren Series, TEMPTING FORTUNE, tells the story of Lord Arcenbryght Malloren and Portia St. Claire.	2003-05-24

Ivo de Vessey, one of Radulf's knights, is the man who falls under her spell and he is not going to let go easily. Ivo is a former knight, his hand disfigured, but he exudes danger and an attraction Briar finds undeniable. Briar instead decides to wield Ivo to her biding and exact revenge that way, though she finds she is at the mercy of the seductive pull Ivo has on her. <br />There are ties to Ms. Bennett's previous books, THE LILY AND THE SWORD and THE ROSE AND THE SHIELF though this book stands alone as a wonderful and fast-paced tale. <br />This book is more sensual than Ms. Bennett's previous books, and it is a daring move that puts Ms. Bennett's in the same category as Virginia Henley, another master who weaves romance, sensuality and history together to make the ultimate historical romance experience.

It is one of many ways the authenticity of the times comes to life on the pages of this book. <br />Elspeth is a maidservant and mistreated by her &quot;step-sisters&quot;, much like Cinderella, with even one sister named Drusilla, a great name choice for this very annoying character. She has no memory of her well-born status prior to life at Farnsworth. <br />This book moves two mortals' paths by a magic they are unaware of. The Faerie element is entertaining and lends comic relief to an otherwise serious toned story. <br />The sequel to ABDUCTED HEIRESS, this book stands alone as a good read. It's slow-moving pace, with an emphasis on detail rather than on conflict makes it a sleeper hit for those looking for a quiet read.	2003-05-17

The Foreign Office has called upon him for his help in finding a valuable amulet that the Egyptian government wants back. In order to avoid an international political disaster, he is enlisted to seduce Phoebe Thompson in order to find out where the amulet is. <BR>Phoebe Thompson, who has only recently returned to London after 4 years in Egypt, is desperately searching for her Egyptologist father who is missing. Not only that, he is being accused of taking the amulet. <br />SEDUCED BY A ROGUE does not have a prologue and it is desperately in need of one. There is a lot that has happened that the reader has to catch up on quickly, without the benefit of knowing these characters and why it is likely they might have fallen in love with each other in the first place. Ramsey and Phoebe were married four years ago, but they only shared one night of marital bliss before their entire relationship comes crashing down around them. A close friend convinces Phoebe that Ramsey is a womanizer and she leaves him immediately to go with her father to Egypt, not to return until 4 years later. <br />The story is very predictable, and the characters very one-dimensional. It's light and fun reading, but there are no surprises here. Without the benefit of a prologue or backing the story up four years, much of the development of this couple is missing.	2003-05-17

This book takes place in 1945 and is based around Claire Randall, a combat nurse who has recently returned from the war. The story starts out with Claire and her husband, Frank, visiting Scotland in an attempt to rekindle their marriage, where most of their time has been spent apart. <BR>Claire finds herself catapulted back to 1743, Scotland where she meets and marries James Fraser, a young Scot clansman, whose relationship with his Clan MacKenzie Uncles is riddled with mystery. <br />Her adventure in time starts out by running into her future nemesis, Captain Jonathan Randall, who amusingly looks just like her husband she has left behind in the 1945 Scotland. She is quickly rescued by the Clan MacKenzie. The story begins well but quickly falters from here on. <br />To escape the hands of Captain Jonathan Randall, Claire must marry Jamie. Initially you can believe these two characters might fall in love until Jamie Fraser beats Claire for not obeying him. Claire, having left one husband in the future, does not hesitate to enter into this other marriage with Fraser. The unbelievable acceptance of her fate is a major flaw in this time travel story. <br />The story is slow moving and the plot develops in a predictable way. <br />If you are looking for a Scottish adventure with sword play and romance, I do not recommend this book.	2003-05-17

He has been sent there by the King's order to marry one of the three maidens at Summerbourne and to deliver the body of the man he killed. Claire Summerbourne and her two aunts are the marital choices, however the two aunts flee to the convent leaving Claire to take on the responsibility. <br />The entire premise to the story is dismal and the fact this man has killed the family's patriarch is disturbing, not to mention that one of them must marry him. Claire Summerbourne, being the obvious choice to become the intended bride does not talk much with Renald, her intended, until midway through the story. Though we are lead to believe she is falling in love, there is very little chemistry between them. <br />Renald, who was a light and impulsive character when we first meet him in DARK CHAMPION, is a ghost of that man in this story. Not portrayed when we first meet him as a serious warrior, he is every bit that in this story. Understandably he has just killed a man and now must marry his daughter. This could potentially explain his change in attitude though the change is not fully embraced nor the story believable. Bastard FitzRoger, who he played 2nd to in that story, clearly out shadows him and it is hard to understand the change to the enchanting Renald in DARK CHAMPION. <br />Sparks begin to fly eventually and Jo Beverley is a consistently good storyteller making the read worthwhile but not with the heavy punches of her two earlier medievals.	2003-05-17

Georgina resents Colin for being the mastermind behind her marriage betrothal to Lord Phineas. Their wonderful night of passion remains in their minds however and they find themselves drawn to each other. The book actually has two parts to it, the first being quite light and erotic as the seduction comes to play and the second being more serious once they meet again. The change in Georgina from seductress in the first part to angry and resentful woman in the second part is a hard switch to accept as a reader. I would have enjoyed one or the other, as I had quickly grown quite attached to Georgina in the first section. <br />Overall, this story is a wonderful read, and Elizabeth Boyle introduces feisty characters and an interesting plot.	2003-05-17

There was something missing in this tale of a white woman stolen by the Comanche. The premise itself was engaging but the characters were not. The first book I have read by Joan Johnston, I felt like I was missing some vital history and that the characters I were reading about were really not 2-Dimensional as they appeared to be, but there was more to this that was not included in this particular book. Bayleigh Steward, a tall and beautiful redheaded white woman was stolen three years ago by Comanche from her father's plantation. Her sister Cricket has asked that Long Quiet, a friend of her husband's, search for her. Long Quiet is a son of a Comanche woman and a white father and able to pass between the two worlds of Comanche and white people. Long Quiet once met Bayleigh and had decided that she was the woman for him, the one he wanted to have as his wife. He takes on the responsibility of finding her very seriously. When helping a Comanche, Many Horses, escape from a brutal death, he is embraced as a blood brother and taken back to the camp where he understands a redheaded white woman is being help captive. As a thank you for saving his life Many Horses offers Long Quiet the white woman Shadow he sees he desires to use as he wishes. Of course Long Quiet accepts. The reader is led to believe certain things at this stage regarding Shadow, that her captors abused her. However, this never happened in the ways you would think and it's too unbelievable to accept as a reader. The stage is set, the characters are in place, but something is missing. This story lacks the punch necessary to make this an engaging read.	2003-05-17

For circumstances I will not reveal in this review, she does choose him and they marry much to the delight of the reader.

However, the chemistry between the hero and heroine is lacking, perhaps due to the very violent realistic backdrop and total hopelessness of the situation. <br />As Ian begins to find his Scottish roots again, and becomes \\"The Raven\\" in order to help his mother's people. Leitus finds herself falling in love with him, and therefore her captor in disguise. <br />This story is too gloomy and sober for this reviewer's taste though Ms. Ranney is not to be faulted for her writing, which is fluid and well paced.	2003-05-17

As a young boy he witnesses a violent act upon his sister, and feeling helpless and the cause for the tragedy, closes him off to others. His pursuits turn to making himself a self-made man in English society. <BR>As the newly appointed head of Queen Victoria's Morality & Vice Commission, Simon Belleville finds himself breaking up a brothel where he discovers Christine in an attic. Not sure why, he takes the lovely young \\"prostitute\\" to his home instead of to Newgate Gaol. As an aspiring Member of Parliament, the very last thing Simon needs is a scandal so he introduces her as his cousin. However, he has anything but cousinly feelings towards the intriguing young girl. <br />Christine is also no stranger to hardship and tragedy. Bullied by her cousin who she believes she has killed, she finds herself alone, hungry, and in a brothel. Simon changes all that, as her \\"dark angel\\" and places in his old mistress's school to develop a refined woman. <br />Hope Tarr weaves a tale of two people searching for themselves and for each other. The mixture of violence, which is not graphically portrayed, and the nature of the gentle tale are an unusual mix. It could almost be characterized as an innocent and sweet romance without these dark undercurrents running throughout the book. I would have liked to see Ms. Tarr develop these dark themes more, and not hesitate to show the reader the brutalism endured by the main characters. I believe it would have helped strengthen the storyline of the book. <br />TEMPTING is an original and enjoyable read from the talented Ms. Tarr. There is an earthy realism to her writing style; her characters are portrayed as real people with flaws, both physical and mental. Don't miss this special read!	2003-05-17

Kell comes to her rescue and sends his violent brother away and finds he must \\"attend\\" to her needs as the aphrodisiac rages within her. <br />Soon after, Raven and Kell find themselves engaged in an attempt to save her reputation. Kell feels obligated to do this because of his brother's vile actions and the reader is led to believe this is as it should be. <br />I was game to accept these flimsy reasons and the storyline continues to fall flat from there. Towards the end my head was spinning with other secondary characters from previous books before this one and their obvious introduction was meant to tie all the books in. As a new reader of Nicole Jordan's novels, I found this befuddling and a tad on the ridiculous. <br />With that said, I still found this book entertaining and a fun read, without much depth. One should be prepared to be led along with story and if you accept the storyline and go where the author is taking you, as you are meant to, you will enjoy this.	2003-05-17

Reluctant to approach her liege lord, Lord Radulf (from THE LILY AND THE SWORD) for help she instead hires Gunnar Olafson (son of Olaf and Gundren from THE LILY AND THE SWORD) and his band of mercenaries to protect Somerford Manor against raiders believe to be merefolk by her peopel. Unbeknownst to her, he is hired to spy on Lady Rose and expose her for treason. His reward will be Somerford Manor for himself. <br />Upon first meeting Gunnar and Rose are attracted to each other. Gunnar is a hero to swoon over. Large in size and handsome in face he is frequently surrounded by ogling women. Described most vividly by Ms. Bennett, he is a Viking with blue eyes like the ocean, and long reddish hair. Rose finds herself under his sensual spell. He is not immune to her charms either. Gunnar initially doubts Roses innocence, and sees her as a conniving woman in cahoots with her knight. He soon realizes this is not the case, and Rose has ably handled the administration of her lands and people. <br />The physical chemistry between these two characters sparks from the beginning. As the story progresses the love for each other matches their passion. <br />Ms. Bennett does a wonderful job providing a passionate romance in 1072 England and stays consistent in this second book and follow up of THE LILY AND THE SWORD. <br />Watch for more wonderful stories from Ms. Bennett in 2003. Ivo de Vesseys story will be called ONCE HE LOVES and released in April 03.	2003-05-17

It defied conventional storylines and continued to surprise each step away. Traditional resolutions that were expected did not come. Ms. Brisbin weaves a tale of love, passion, acceptance, and political intrigue that is sure to become a classic. <br />Bravo, Ms. Brisbin!	2002-12-01

Judith McNaught utterly shines in this spectacular debut novel that launched her career. WHITNEY, MY LOVE was a delight from start to finish. Never having read the original version of this book, I read the glorious 708 page extended version without ever taking a break. Emerging my self from a blurry-eyed dream that is this novel, I'm pleased to say this classic lives up to it's reputation. <br />Whitney Stone, a young and impetuous girl believes herself in love with Paul, the recipient of all her youthful feelings and dreams. Her disapproving father deems her behavior inappropriate and she finds herself sent to France with her beloved Aunt and Uncle. These she is allowed to bloom into the beautiful, unique women she is. She finds herself groomed into a lady and becomes the toast of Paris. As she perfects her arts as a lady she deems it time to return home to win the heart of Paul, her childhood sweetheart. Unbeknownst to her, her father has betrothed her to Clayton Westmoreland, the Duke of Claymore. Her father's uncontrollable debts have wiped out her inheritance and her dowry and the Duke is the answer to his financial difficult. <br />Whitney, however, wants nothing to do with the Clayton and pursues Paul and finally wins his heart. From there, you'll have to read the story yourself! <br />There is a disturbing scene in this book that is often times discussed. I'll leave the reader to draw his or her own conclusions and opinions on it. I, however, found this to be a powerful story and enjoyed it immensely. I'm certain I will not forget the names Whitney or Clayton Westmoreland and they will continue to burn in my mind as one of the more stormy and passionate couples I have ever read about it. <br />One might draw parallels to GONE WITH THE WIND and this novel, However where Scarlet O'Hara does not realize her love for Rhett Butler until it is much too late, Whitney is not so foolish. <br />Enjoy reading this classic romance! ...	2002-12-01

Lorelei Dupree and her fianc&eacute;, Justin Wallingford, set out to catch Black Jack Rhys, the infamous pirate. Lorelei, confident in her feminine whiles, believes she knows how to handle any man by treating him like a dog. However she will find out Black Jack Rhys is not like other men.<br />Posing as a bar maid, Lorelei finds herself face to face with Jack Rhys, who she met before the night before, but that night he was no pirate! Indeed he is in the famous pirate, and he quickly takes her from the bar as a hostage and sets the course for adventure and romance on the high seas.<br />Their relationship becomes one of passion, a struggle of wills, and ultimately a deep love.<br />The book is entitled MASTER OF DESIRE, which seems a bit misleading. Black Jack is a deeply scarred man, and in no way exemplifies a master of women or of experience. He in fact is quite solitary and dark.<br />There are several gaps in Ms. Macgregor's writing where secondary characters are still in the room, if one reads the book carefully, while the couple embraces. I found this distracting that these mistakes were made. In Kinley Macgregor's defense, her characterization of Black Jack Rhys is second to none and the book was a first rate and enjoyable read.	2002-06-30

Gavin and Judith are characters you will remember for many years to come after you set done the book. I read a lot of romances, and if I remember their names some time later, I know the author has struck a cord with myself. Gavin is a handsome and strong man, the eldest of several brothers (read the rest of the series to find out what happens to them!) and he meets the beautiful Judith. Alice was a wonderful twist to the story, and I'm sure I wasn't alone in my frustration of Gavin's blindness to her faults. Jude Deveraux is becoming one of my favorite authors in the romance genre, I have only recently discovered her and have yet to find a book I don't like! Enjoy.	2000-10-29
