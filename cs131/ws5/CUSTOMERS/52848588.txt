He wrote 6-8 masterpieces, which should be required reading for anyone with some interest in science fiction.   <br /> <br />However, he also wrote some plain awful novels in order to make a living.  In general, the books he wrote in the 1950s are his worst with Vulcan's Hammer being his worst published novel ever (in my opinion).  The story is flimsy and dull...one of Dick's biographers (Lawrence Sutin) also cites it as probably being his worst book.  <br /> <br />I'm only writing this review because I just can't believe the number of positive reviews for this book.  If \\"Man in the High Castle\\", which is probably Dick's best work, deserves 5 stars... then by that scale, Vulcan's hammer deserves a 0.5.   <br /> <br />The fact that this book was even reprinted is a shame...a real waste of paper.   <br /> <br />	2005-02-15

I bought them because \\"To Walk the Night\\" is cited as one of the \\"100 best Fantasy\\" novels, according to J. Cawthorn and Michael Moorcock.<br /><br />Basically, I agree with everything the previous reviewer wrote, and I also feel that \\"Running Water\\" is slightly better than \\"To Walk the Night\\" although \\"Night\\" is also highly recommended.<br /><br />Both of Sloane's novels concern themes that were used by his contemporary, H.P. Lovecraft (\\"obsessed scientists pursuing forbidden knowledge\\").  However, Sloane is a far better writer than Lovecraft, and his characterization is excellent.  Unlike Lovecraft, Sloane's novels have female characters and \\"Running Water\\" even has a romance as one of its sub-plots...something that Lovecraft was incapable of doing.  Finally, Sloane had a beautiful writing style and both of his (only) two novels are real pageturners....I finished both of them within 2 days each.  Despite their age, the writing style is contemporary and there were only a few things such as slang-terms that dated them.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that nearly everything Lovecraft ever wrote or even half-wrote (\\"if you know what I mean\\") is back-in print while Sloane's two masterpieces have been out of print for decades!	2004-12-31
US	52848588	RHITH1JM5STNN	1882968298	570249058	A Mirror for Observers	Books	3	9	11	N	Y	Potentially a great book.  However....	I've wanted to read this book ever since I first read about it in David Pringle's \\"100 Best SF Novels\\"(1988).  Well, I finally finished reading it last week.  Mirror was originally published in 1954, and it's the 2nd novel by Edgar Pangborn, who's best remembered today for his 1960s novel, \\"Davy\\".      The story is set in the 1960s-70s (the \\"future\\" back in 1954!); it's a morality tale focused on a young man, named Angelo who has the potential for greatness, if he doesn't turn to the \\"dark side\\" first:)  Angelo is mentored by a kindly, avuncular man (\\"Elmis\\"), who's really a Martian in human disguise.  He's also being influenced by another Martian (\\"Namir\\"), who's out to destroy humanity.  Eventually Angelo runs away from home, and the book concerns Elmis' long quest to find him, and bring him back to the fold.    The premise and plot of Observers is compelling; however, the writing and characterization are very flawed, so I have to take two stars off:  The book's writing is rather quaint and \\"precious\\" at times, and the dialogue is just plain awful at points.  The characterization of the Martian narrator is just unbelieveable- he's stricken with an intense \\"love for humanity\\" and his various digressions on culture and music, etc are annoying.  He's obviously just a stand-in for Pangborn himself.  (The book would have worked better as a fantasy- if Elmis and Namir were an angel and demon instead of being aliens.)  Also bad is the characterization of Angelo's love interest, Sharon, who Pangborn puts on a very high pedestal...    Pangborn was born in 1909, so he was old enough to remember the 1918 Influenza pandemic in which 20-50 million people died worldwide.  Perhaps that explains why the plot includes another devastating pandemic as it's climax.	2004-10-18

Deller and Grove do a terrific job of explaining BASIC dsp concepts from the ground-up while avoiding high-level math (for the most part).   <br /> <br />I rank it above Steven Smith's DSP book since it has more clarity and detail.  Richard Lyon's \\"Understanding DSP\\" has more mathematical details, but it's not as user-friendly as this book-so I'd recommend this book first for newbies to DSP and then, Lyon's book.   <br /> <br />Oh yeah, the cartoons are great too! <br /> <br />	2004-08-29

I bought this recently because it includes the short novel, \\"Herovitt's World\\"(1973), which is a neglected classic-basically, it's a devastatingly funny portrait of a hack SF writer, who's on the verge of a psychological collapse.  I read that book about a decade ago, and I'm glad to say that it holds up upon re-reading. <br /> <br />The other stories in \\"Passage of the Light\\" are also quite good albeit not as great.  (Basically, this is an anthology of Malzberg's stories which are about SF and or SF writing.)  If you only know Malzberg from such depressing and bewildering novels like \\"Beyond Apollo\\", then give this a try, since all of the stories are highly entertaining and funny and sometimes even brillant.  The only downside of this collection is that it doesn't include \\"Galaxies\\", which is probably Malzberg's best novel after H.W.

I read this book about 15 years ago just before I entered an engineering university. Kline's basic premise is that mathematics professors are far more interested in research than in teaching; he also faults the abstract and non-intuitive (and dull) mathematics textbooks that discourage and mystify students rather than enlighten. Unfortunately, all of this still applies today... not just in mathematics, but in science and engineering as well.  <br /> <br />Simply put, the university system in the US is broken...the cost of tuition keeps going up, but this has almost nothing to do with the \\"quality\\" of education. Rather it goes into paying salaries of prestigious professors who care only about their research...teaching is simply a nuisance to them (and few of them are good at it anyway).  <br /> <br />What's needed is a new low-cost method (web-based courses or even animation) that is more intuitive and pedagogical than the current lecture-based system. (Research shows that the lecture-system is almost the worst way to learn.) In this day and age, a good education (e.g., an interactive program that can adapt to an individual's learning style on a low-cost media like a DVD) should be a commodity; the fact that the cost for \\"higher\\" education is out-of-control like health-care costs (another institution that sticks to antiquated methods) is one of the greatest failures of our so-called modern society.  <br /> <br />Burdening US students with massive student loans when they're not going to be able to get the high-paying jobs anymore due to globalization is unsustainable... the so-called \\"prestige\\" of graduating from a \\"top\\" private university isn't worth it. In fact, the more you pay, the worse the teaching (because research has even greater priority in the \\"best\\" schools). That's why \\"top\\" schools are so selective...so students can get good grades IN SPITE of the inept teaching!  <br />	2004-03-23

This book is great at giving engineers an intuitive feel for basic electromagnetics and how it relates to signal integrity and emi.  <br />It's main strength (and to some it's major weakness) is that it avoids the mess of equations of better known books like Johnson's &quot;High-Speed Digital Design&quot;.  Brooks is also a good writer, and he writes very clearly.  Don't get this book, if you already understand the subject, since it doesn't cover advanced material.  However, this is essential reading for those who don't have a clue or for those (like me), who've memorized a lot of emi guidelines, without really understanding why they're necessary.<br />Given the book's title, the only area of improvement I can think of is a chapter or appendix on basic pcb manufacturing and terminology (buried vias, microvias, antipads, etc).	2004-03-03

Most of the previous reviews talk about how great the Lee/Ditko run is (Strange Tales 110-146): I fully agree, it's brillant stuff that I think is even better than their run on Spiderman.<br />Unfortunately, the post Ditko issues (147-168) are just awful (frequent writer+artist changes and pedesterian rehashes of previous ideas...Stan Lee wrote some of these issues, but he seemed bored of the series by this point.)  Marvel should have saved the paper, and collected only Strange Tales 110-146.	2004-03-02

The &#34;Ballad of Halo Jones&#34; is one of Alan Moore's earliest works, and orignally appeared in serial-form in Britain's 2000AD magazine during the early 1980s.  Ballad is set in the far future, and chronicles the eponymous heroine from the age of 18 to 35.  The great strength of this series is the strong and diverse characterization of the mostly female cast.  Frankly, I think that sympathetic female characterization has been a problem with Moore (look at his masterpiece, Watchmen, where all of the female characters are neurotic at best), but in this early work, Moore does an outstanding job.  The storyline is also very strong and poignant with a beautiful ending.  Overall, Ballad isn't quite Moore at his best (Watchmen and From Hell), but it's ranks with his &#34;2nd tier&#34; work like Miracleman; and it's head and shoulders over more recent fare like League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  One negative: this trade from Titan reprints the full storyline in the original black and white, and format-size, which is much larger than the standard comic book format.  During the late 1980s in the US, this series was reprinted in color and in standard size.  I wish that this format had been retained...frankly, this is a big book on the bookshelf.	2003-12-22

I was in college during the time, and became a reader around issue 9.  I quickly got back issues, though, because of the surprising strength of this series.  This 3rd volume collects issues 18-26, and it wraps up one of Morrison's best series (the other being Doom Patrol 19-63).  What makes this series outstanding is Morrison's usual trademark &#34;weirdness&#34;; however, unlike the &#34;Invisibles&#34;, Animal Man and Doom Patrol have strong and symphathetic  characterization-Buddy Baker and his family &#34;seem real&#34; even though this series is in part about the unreality of comic books.  AM also has a particulaly strong and poignant ending-again like Doom Patrol.  Issues 1-26 form a complete story- the series should have been allowed to end with 26: added issues in a sense were superfluous.  Only later with Sandman (allowed to end in 1996) did DC learn when &#34;enough is enough&#34;.  To sum up: AM and DP represent Morrison at his magical best.  Don't get me wrong, Invisibles, JLA and X-Men are entertaining.  But I'm hoping he can pull out another white rabbit someday.	2003-11-10

(Issue 20, which was actually Moore's first issue wasn't collected, which is a shame.)<br />Simply put, this first ST collection is magnificient: some of Moore's best writing ever.  Moore re-invents Swamp Thing and then delivers the goods with some of his strongest plots ever.  (Jack Kirby's Demon as a guest-star is particulary strong.)  Bissette and Totleben's artwork is also equally beautiful and horrific.<br />DC has since collected the rest of Moore's run on ST (28-63 and ST annual #2).  While good, the rest of the series doesn't hold up quite as strong.  The American Gothic storyline for ex., is interesting, but (to me) it simply doesn't have the impact of these early issues.  Also, the romance between ST and Abby just isn't believable...But that doesn't matter, these early issues still hold up quite well-20 years haven't diminished their impact.	2003-11-03

Johnson's High Speed Digital Design (1993) is widely cited as the definitive book on signal integrity for digital design.  I've had it on my bookshelf now for about 4 years, but to be honest: I regret buying it.  The subject overview is definitely useful; however, as some have pointed out, the theoretical coverage isn't very good.  Johnson presents a lot of equations, but without giving readers an intuitive understanding of what's really going on.  Also, IMO, Johnson isn't a good writer.  He lacks depth and the ability to explain things clearly.  To be honest, to learn signal integrity, there isn't really a good book out there.  Update:  I've updated my review from 3-&#62;4 Stars.  I still think the book isn't that intuitive.  However, it's jam-packed with invaluable information.  It's worth owning just for the sections on AC fan-out and via considerations for critical signals.	2003-10-24

Unfortunately, it doesn't.  The writing is solid; I also agree that it's message of tolerance is as timely as ever.  However, the basic storyline just wasn't that engaging.

Unfortunately, the series was canceled before the storyline was properly concluded, but still this is an enjoyable read for superhero fans.<br />Moore's Supreme series is basically an homage and parody of Superman- unlike the first &quot;Story of the Year&quot; storyline, though, &quot;Return&quot; has far fewer flashback stories-I actually enjoy the meticulous recreations of 50s and 60s-style stories, but I know it annoyed some readers.  Also, the printing quality of Return is pretty good-unlike the first volume<br />I'm really more a fan of Moore's early work (Halo Jones, Miracleman and Watchmen).  However, as a person who at least appreciates Superman, Supreme is a lot of fun.  I certainly liked it a lot more than &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (both are period pieces, but Supreme has a more entertaining storyline).	2003-07-10

To add to the confusion, both sets of issues (1-5) featured a Trigon storyline !<br />Anyway, the art by George Perez is gorgeous-some of his best ever.  The writing is ok too, but the storyline is nothing new: kind of derivative of the X-men (Raven ~Phoenix becomes corrupted by her darker nature and goes bad.)  Now as an adult, I prefer more sophisticated fare... I guess nostalgia only goes so far.	2003-06-24

However, this anthology also highlights several of his faults as a writer:  while coming up with interesting premises, the execution and plot are sometimes lacking (this is more evident in the often rushed endings of his novels than in his short stories); also, Little's characterization is much weaker than King or Koontz.  Often he has his characters do &quot;weird&quot; things- often they seem compelled to do so- for the sake of the horrific effect, but at the expense of credibility.<br />However, Little has one tremendous strength that he shares in particular with Koontz: although this is a long book , you'll fly through it, since he has a highly readable writing style.	2003-03-07

Approx 6-10 of his books are classics; however, Dick also wrote a lot of just plain awful books (esp. in the 1950s); and due to his growing popularity, some of these books are actually being brought back into print (e.g., the Man Who Japed, World Jones Made).  Luckily Counter-Clock world (1966) isn't one of them; however, this is one of Dick's lesser works.  It's a short, mildy amusing read, but the ideas in it are frankly underdeveloped and unconvincing.  Race relations also are thankfully much better than depicted in this rather quaint and obsolete \\"clunker\\" of a book.  Save your money and get this from the library; or better yet, read something better (and similar) like Ubik.	2003-01-20

Paul Nahin's book supposedly covers the history of i.  The problem with this book is that it jumps around too much, which made it difficult (for me) to follow the main points.  (There are too many asides and digressions- Nahin's enthusiasm apparently takes control of his editorial sense.)<br /><br />Finally, this book definitely requires more than a high school background, if you're average in math (like me).  This book has some history, but it's spread out over WAY TOO many equations.(Obviously, Nahin doesn't realize that much of what he writes goes \\"over the heads\\" of \\"non-math-inclined\\" folks.)

However, the updated sections are frankly a bit skimpy.  <br />The heart of the book still remains a highly detailed description of the core x86 architecture, which is invaluable.<BR>Mueller has retained all of this material since he probably exerted a great deal of effort in writing them for the 1st edition.  However, the newer material, which is equally important, lacks the same kind of depth.  So the &quot;Indispensible PC hardware book&quot; is no longer enough on it's own.

The authors do a superb job of describing the symptons and treatment of sleep apnea.  They also dispel common misconceptions about sleep apnea- like &quot;thin and young people can't have it&quot;-something which, most dr.s still believe.  Unfortunately, most dr.s are very ignorant about sleep disorders, and often, it's the last thing they check for.<br />My only problem(s) with this book are: that it doesn't elaborate on Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome, a close cousin to apnea and hypopnea; and while it states that UPPP surgery can eliminate snoring w/o treating the underlying apnea, it doesn't explicity state that it's possible (albeit admittedly less common) to have apnea w/o snoring in the first place.  Finally, IMO, the authors should have stressed the importance of heated humidifiers in CPAP treatment (a breathing machine, which is the most common treatment for apnea).<BR>  <BR>This sounds like a lot of &quot;complaints&quot; but the overall excellence of the book doesn't keep me from giving it the 5-stars.	2002-06-24

Hodgson's The Night Land (1912) is frequently cited as one of the great masterpieces of horror and fantasy fiction.  In terms of premise and ideas (and to an extent the basic plot), I'd agree.  However, the characterization (esp. of women) and the writing style of this novel is absymal- it's nearly unreadable. Hodgson uses a mock-medieval writing style for reasons known only to himself.     I've read most of Hodgson's novels (4 out of 5) and this is easily the worst-written of them (Boats of the Glen Carig is similarly flawed)-and it's a near-fatal flaw.  As far as I'm concerned, Hodgson's \\"House on the Borderland\\" (1908) remains his only masterpiece.  In fact, I've read an interesting article which suggests that Hodgson published his novels in the reverse-order of their actual writing, which means that House would've been one of his last works, i.e., he improved with time.	2002-04-26

I first read Consider Phelbas about 8 years ago, and I just reread it for the 2nd time.<br /><br />CP is Bank's first \\"Culture\\" science fiction novel.  It's basically old-fashioned space opera written in a more literary style.  The writing style is at times wonderful-even poetic-but I found it too dense most of the time.  Banks, like Tim Powers, is at times pretty hard to read vs. say someone like Dean Koontz or Stephen King.  This has kept Banks from achieving greater popularity (I think).<br /><br />The ending of the novel, though, is poignant and does make up for some of the excesses of the novel.  However, the protagonist, who dies at the end, is ultimately a fool-he gets himself and a lot of other good people killed for some dumb abstract ideology(analogous to joining the Nazi Party to fight Communism).	2001-07-23

Vol 2, which reprints Daredevil 168-182(the entire Elektra storyline in which Daredevil finds his long-lost first love only to tragically lose her again) is fabulous and epic.  Highly recomended.

Contemporary novels like Alfred Bester's Stars My Destination(1956) are far better known, but PM stands eye to eye with any other sf classic of the 1950s.<br />Ring and Firebird, and Drunkard's Endgame are good novels too-but frankly, Harness lost something after returning to SF in the late 1960s after a long hiatus.  Even so, the entire volume is well worth reading and owning.  The relative obscurity of PM shows that sometimes quality isn't enough...	2001-03-04
US	52848588	R1RCMAKDSBN3QS	0679767819	664674670	The Demolished Man	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A classic, but dated...	I first read this book 15 years ago as a teenager.  Just reread it a few  days ago.  Demolished Man is cited as a masterpiece in various sources like  D.Pringle's 100 best SF novels, B.Aldis's Trillion Year Spree and even the  Reader's guide to SF.<br />It is defintely a classic (although it pales next  to Bester's &quot;Stars My Destination&quot;).  The writing, pacing and  plotting of the book still shine.  However, the characterization and  especically the psychology of the book are increasingly dated(and flawed).   Bester was obviously a believer in Freudian psychology(as evidenced in some  of his short stories like Oddy and Id)-nothing wrong with that-but to hang  the crux of the story around it-is a fatal mistake.  IMHO, the  (unbelievable to me) motivation of Ben Reich, and all of the trappings of a  society built around telepaty are just, well, quaint.  Kinda reminds me of  Dianetics-also, a 1950s SF product.	2000-09-05
US	52848588	RTE2ZQI7PG075	0930289234	777411096	Watchmen	Books	5	6	8	N	N	A classic of all genres	I first read Watchmen in high school, and it greatly impressed me of course.  Over a decade later, I reread it and it impresses me even more.  Watchmen is simply the best thing Alan Moore has ever written, and as such,  the best graphic novel ever IMHO.  Comic book writers like Neil Gaiman, for  ex., may be more popular, but at his peak, Moore was the best writer in  terms of style, plotting, intellect and sheer cleverness to work in the  genre.  I used to think the book's only failing was Dave Gibbon's artwork,  which isn't particularly slick or &quot;pretty&quot;; however, Gibbon's  layouts were essential in conveying such a dense story, so I've changed my  mind since.<br />In summary, Watchmen is one of the cleverest, and best novels  of recent decades to appear of any genre.	2000-07-15
