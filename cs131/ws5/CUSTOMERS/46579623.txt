Perhaps it isn't how you write, it's whom you know. Although the title of my review is really quite clear, I would like to add that the author is very inconsistent when it comes to Icy Sparks' narrations and conversations.  At times Gwyn Rubio has Icy coming across as a college-educated individual; at other times she has her coming across as a barefoot gal &quot;from them thar' hills.&quot;  There just is no consistency here, and I consider this poor writing.<br />I have done quite a bit of reading and research on Tourette's Syndrome, and never have I come across any information that would lead me to glean that a Tourette's Syndrome sufferer's eyes can pop out like a frog's.  I imagine they can grow pretty wide, but Rubio would have the reader believe that Icy's eyes literally periodically popped out of their sockets like a frog's eyes.  If that is not what she meant, that still is how it came across.  And if that is one of the possible symptoms of Tourette's Syndrome, it is news to me.<br />The ending was very weak and seemed sort of pulled together as a last resort because the author didn't know how else to end this tedious tale.	2001-06-21

I think he made a mistake when he deviated from what he does best, and that is writing stories about law and order.  &quot;A Painted House&quot; is the kind of book that is easy to put down and not pick up again for days.  I found it rather slow and at times downright boring.  People slave in the cotton fields day after day and fall into bed completely exhausted every night, only to get up again the next morning to repeat the whole process over again.  This is not to say that there weren't some interesting pages in the book about migrant workers and mountain people who came to pick cotton so that they could make ends meet and put food on their table.  However, in the final analysis, I thought this tedious tale would never end.	2001-05-21

Andre Dubus is a very gifted writer with an extraordinary imagination.  I was spellbound throughout the entire book.  I did not like all the sex &quot;scenes&quot; between Kathy Nicolo and her co-adulterer, Les Burdon, and didn't feel they were necessary to the plot.  Both of these characters were a psychological mess, and all of my sympathy went to the Behrani family.  The ending was tragic for all concerned.  House of Sand and Fog is one of those books that is very hard to put down once one starts reading it.  A very compelling novel.	2001-03-24

By the end of the first chapter, I had slid to the edge of my seat and stayed there until the end.  The reason I didn't give this book five stars is because it was often confusing to follow.  The author kept going back and forth between the past and the present, and sometimes I had to retrace my steps to make sure I had a handle on what was happening to which characters and when.  Usually, when I get a book that does that, I take it back to the library, but in this instance, the plot thickened with every page, and I could not put it down. The book built up to an almost unbearable climax, but it didn't end the way I expected it to, which was a bit of a letdown.<br />Nevertheless, I  am now looking forward to a second novel by Christina Schwarz.  She certainly knows how to weave a tale of great suspense.	2001-01-19

Does lack of punctuation throughout (especially quotation marks) establish one as an author?  Very confusing story.  Incidentally, not by any stretch of the imagination can this be referred to as a &quot;novel.&quot;  It is barely 145 pages in length; I believe that constitutes a &quot;novella.&quot;  I read so many upbeat reviews about &quot;Ellen Foster,&quot; I hurried to my local library to check it out. I have very gifted grandchildren, any one of who could have written this &quot;booklet&quot; so that it flowed for the reader.  If this is the author's established style of writing, I do hope she isn't planning to afflict us with a second story.  This was a good plot gone to waste.	2001-01-06

Was I ever in for a disappointment; but not because the book was so horribly depressing.  Some books cheer me up, some books depress me; some books challenge me.  A good book is a good book, no matter what.  However, this was a very different, very off-the-wall style of writing.  Jane Hamilton, throughout a good portion of the book, put words in Ruth's thoughts that didn't even make nonsense; for example: &quot;The grass was so lush and green I half hoped someone would put me out to pasture.&quot;  &quot;I bet my face looked like a raisin somebody stepped on.&quot;  &quot;It was so cold, his tears were the consistency of slush.&quot;  &quot;I called up Artie and told him I was sick as a dead pig.&quot;  &quot;My head felt like a bowl full of hot applesauce.&quot;  &quot;She waited on us hand and toe.&quot;  And I've only scratched the surface.  The book is chock full of this kind of idiocy.  In addition, I was very offended by this story.  I have a suspicion that Jane Hamilton may be an agnostic or an atheist.  Nobody with the slightest iota of respect for the Word of God would write as sacrilegiously as has Jane Hamilton in The Book of Ruth.  I do not care to repeat here the abominations she has put on paper concerning God, his son Jesus, and Scripture in general.  She has also, through Ruth's thoughts, wiped the floor with the pastor of the church Ruth sometimes attended.  I believe that Jane Hamilton, through Ruth's thoughts, has shown quite clearly what she thinks not only of organized religion, but of a person's personal relationship with the savior of the world.  As a Christian, I truly resent this book.  You might ask why I continued to read it. I was driven to see it to the end because, it was building up to such a violent crescendo that I had to find out what the end was like.  As I mentioned in the title of my review, the book had astrong plot.  Robert Morgan could have taken that plot and created a work of genius with it.  Jane Hamilton created a strong plot but also created this Ruth person whose weird, nonsensical and sacrilegious thoughts emanated from her almost constantly.  I saw her as a stupid woman with a deep-seated desire to destroy herself.  Not once did I feel any empathy for her.  She was not only self-destructive, but when she was not thinking drivel, she was entertaining sacrilegious thoughts about the church, the pastor, and Holy Scripture.  So far as I'm concerned, in the end Ruth got every bit of what she deserved, but I, the reader, felt polluted!  I did not want to give this novel even half a star, but I gave it one star because I guess that's the lowest grade one can assign to a book according to the &quot;How do you rate this book?&quot; box.  Read this book at your own risk!	2000-12-30

This is the heart-breaking story of an overly zealous, misguided missionary who sincerely felt he was doing the Lord's work in the Congo.  He put his entire family at risk while he tried to jam what he felt was the Lord's will for these people down their throats.  This tale is also political in that it shows, in no uncertain terms, the negative role the United States played just when the Congolese were attempting to achieve independence from Belgium.  Shame on us for thinking we're the saviour of the world, and thanks to Barbara Kingsolver for her courage in the writing of this book!  The most dramatic and heart-rending moment for me was when the youngest daughter was bitten by the deadly mamba snake (probably the deadliest snake in the world), and died very soon afterwards.  The missionary father eventually descends into a world of madness, and the mother and remaining daughters leave for the states.  It is a story that is still with me, months after having read it.  Not for the Danielle Steel crowd, but definitely for those who appreciate fine literature.	2000-12-28

I read Jane Eyre twice and comprehended every word, every nuance.  Wuthering Heights was another matter.  So much of it was obtuse. Just a little while ago, I read a very helpful review here by an English teacher no less, who said he had trouble comprehending the story the first time around, but he has read it again and this time it was a completely different and positive experience for him.  I certainly have benefited from this particular review because now I am going to read Wuthering Heights again with a different attitude.  It is not easy reading; it is a deep book.  You have to concentrate, but I know I can do it, and I am going to do it!  Even though I saw the movie before I read the book (I thought the movie starring Merle Oberon and Lawrence Olivier was outstanding), parts of the book were still obtuse.  If I hadn't seen the movie, I suppose the book would have been a total imposssibility.  I don't mean to seem so negative about Wuthering Heights, but I have never in my life read a book where I had to concentrate so much; it took the pleasure out of reading it.	2000-12-25

I had heard so much about Toni Morrison I thought I would read this book (my first by Toni Morrison). It was difficult to read; very disjointed; the writing did not flow.  I almost took it back to the library before I was half-way through but decided to stay with it until the bitter end.  When I finally finished it, I returned it to the library and then went among the stacks to locate some more of Morrison's books, thinking perhaps I could find another that would strike my fancy.  I stayed at the library for a time and tried to interest myself in some of her other writings.  It's no use.  When she isn't being obtuse, she is being plodding.  There are altogether too many other outstanding novels out there for me to read; no more Toni Morrison, thank you, even if she is a professor.	2000-12-25

Rebecca, again in my opinion, is her second best.  I drank in every word; I couldn't put the book down.  The incredibly spooky housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who hated Rebecca, made my skin crawl.  It was Mrs. DeWinters this and Mrs. DeWinters that; she never let Rebecca forget that, so far as Mrs. Danvers was concerned, the first Mrs. DeWinters was still a presence in that house and always would be.  The most dramatic moment in the book, for me, was when the meek Rebecca, for the first time, finally stood up to Mrs. Danvers, looked her straight in the eye, and said, emphatically, &quot;I am Mrs. DeWinters now!&quot;  I saw the movie before I read the book.  It was surprisingly true to the book, and I thought Joan Fontaine and Lawrence Olivier were perfectly cast in the leading roles.  I cannot recall the name of the actress who portrayed Mrs. Danvers, but she was superb!  Actually, I would have liked to have given Rebecca 4 1/2 stars, but there is no accommodation for halves in the &quot;How do you rate this book&quot; box.	2000-12-25

It is truly a heart-breaking story.  In The Grapes of Wrath you see capitalism at its worst, at its most hateful.  The common man is nothing but scum.  There is a lot of cussing in this book, which I did not appreciate, but that's Steinbeck.  He is still a genius.  The ending is a real shocker!  I never dreamed it would end this way, and when it came, I couldn't believe it!  It depicted, in no uncertain terms, the devastating, unspeakable hunger of a human being and the compassion of another human being in attempting to assuage that hunger.  I saw the movie twice; once before I read the book, and then again after having read the book.  The first time I saw the film, I thought it was great, but after having read the book, the second time I saw the movie, it just did not measure up at all; it was a real disappointment.  I think Hollywood did a mediocre job of trying to bring The Grapes of Wrath to the big screen.  It just didn't work, and of course the ending in the book couldn't possibly have been shown on the screen, not way back in those days, nor in these modern times of anything goes.  It simply would not be possible.  Is your curiosity aroused?  Then read the book.  The Grapes of Wrath is not merely a novel; it is a soul-searing experience!	2000-12-24

I don't care for reviews that give the plot away, but I just want to say this; at the end the reader is left to make up his or her own mind as to whether Rachel was good or evil.  I chose to come to the conclusion that she was good.  Other readers may have reached a different conclusion.  My Cousin Rachel is an outstanding piece of literary achievement!

The Kitchen God's wife is one of the most delightful pieces of literature I have ever read.  I do not have one drop of Chinese blood in me, but I could relate because (and I am certain of this) I have in the past immersed myself in Pearl Buck's books about China and the Chinese mind.  Of course, most of Buck's books are heart breaking; nevertheless, I became addicted to reading about China and the Chinese people because of Pearl Buck.  So, when I picked up The Kitchen God's Wife, I was psychologically ready for Amy Tan.  The book was touching, but at the same time so much of the dialogue was hilarious, and I laughed out loud.

Fortunately, the heroine of this story is finally able to rise above this stench-filled environment.  What a novel!

I would go back to re-read a paragraph every now and then in order to let the words seep into my very soul.
