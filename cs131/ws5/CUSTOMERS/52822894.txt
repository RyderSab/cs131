This book is helpful in understanding Jung's position on Christianity, a subject that preoccupied him throughout his life and which he discussed at length in later works like AION, ANSWER TO JOB, and MYSTERIUM CONIUNCTIONIS.  The book starts out with some background:  Jung's father was a pastor, and a few of his uncles and other relatives were also clergy.  But Jung rebelled against this spiritual tradition early on, continuing until his break with Freud, when he developed a voracious appetite for arcane religious knowledge.  Ultimately, Jung considered himself a Christian, even though he never seemed to discuss Christian subjects outside the context of his own psychological theories: God invariably shows up in his work as the \\"God-Image\\"; Christ is always an archetype of the Self; etc.<br /><br />The book's title refers to a \\"treatment\\" of Christianity.  It's the treatment a doctor applies to a patient.  Stein argues that one of the major ambitions in Jung's vast corpus of writing was to analyze Christianity, find out what's wrong with it, and fix it.  For example, Jung suggested a Quaternity (Father, Christ, Lucifer, Holy Ghost), rather than a Trinity;  he was convinced that Pope Pius XII's Assumptio Mariae doctrine was orthodox Christianity's attempt to move away from a purely spiritual God and toward one that incorporates matter (specifically, the body of Mary); the last chapter of AION \\"...should be read as a preliminary sketch of a transformed Christian dominant,\\" (pg 159).<br /><br />Assuming Stein is correct that Jung was trying to analyze and improve Christianity -- and he makes a good case here -- you have to wonder if it's possible to psychoanalyze a whole religious tradition.  Does it think?  Does it have a personality?  I suppose traditions and organizations in general do have personalities of sorts -- and attitudes and behaviors and dysfunctions and other anthropomorphisms.  But can you \\"treat\\" a whole religion?	2005-08-23

If the book had been about two rational chess players facing each other over a board, it would have put me to sleep.  Fischer is a weird creature who invokes both admiration and derision; but by the end of the book I almost felt sorry for him.<br /><br />The huge amount of cold-war political tension upped the stakes to this series of chess games tremendously, involving President Nixon and Henry Kissinger as well as the Soviet Bureau of Agitation and Propaganda.  The global attention is what allowed Fischer to get away with his unceasing demands:  The white and black squares on the chessboard have too much contrast -- change them.  Now not enough contrast -- change them or Fischer quits.  The lights are too bright, now too dim.  Fischer needs more money.  Too many people in the first seven rows of seats -- move them back.  Too much noise in this room, move to another one.  All of this clearly rattled Spassky.<br /><br />The book describes how the match crippled Spassky psychologically for years, but it  also makes clear that he didn't disintegrate to the extent Fischer ultimately did.  The authors submit several theories explaining Fischer's personality and problems; also a revealing section on Fischer's parents.<br /><br />I heard this on unabridged audio tape.	2005-07-31

The author appears to be an intelligent, articulate person who fell in with Castaneda and his group -- in fact, became one of his many lovers -- in her late 30's, smart enough and old enough to know better.  Her book describes how she destroyed a number of friendships and family relationships during that period, and also gave away a fortune in personal goods, all at Castaneda's request.  She put up with endless humiliations, lies, and personal rejections; categorically subordinated her own opinions to those of the group; and endured a number of other indignities one might associate with brainwashing.  And for what reason?  -- to achieve ego destruction, a requirement of sorcerers-to-be (and also a big part of the soteriology of a number of religions).  Ultimately, around the time of Castaneda's death, she decided that his books were \\"novels\\" and that she had joined a cult.    I think her own book is well-written and even compulsively readable, but I don't understand at all the attraction this way of life -- and Castaneda in particular -- had to Amy Wallace.  Anyone reading this book shoud find Castaneda to be dishonest, temperamental, unsympathetic, selfish, self-aggrandizing, manipulating, power-hungry, and a shameless storyteller.  Wallace describes him physically as both old and pudgy.  Yet she claims that her life with him encompassed both the highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows.  What exactly were the highs to this relationship?  What was the overwhelming attraction?    She points out near the end that just because Castaneda was a human with human weaknesses doesn't invalidate all of the wisdom one might find in his books.  She recommends reading his books but staying away from his cult.  I can't help but think that she gives Castaneda more validation than he deserves.	2005-05-09

Also, there's interesting cameo appearances by John Cale and Allen Ginsberg.  But the real star is of course Nico.  In the beginning, Young describes her as a depressing, hollowed-out drug addict, \\"... her hands and arms scabbed and scarred by needletracks, and her eyes like a broken mirror.\\" (pg 12) But as I followed the characters from gig to gig, scraping just enough money together to support Nico's habit, followed by the recording of the CAMERA OBSCURA album, then more money and more gigs; through all this, Nico emerges somehow as a sympathetic character, far more interesting than the other eccentrics in her group.  At the end, I felt sad to see her go.	2004-11-29

That, and the fact that it's fairly obscure (compared to the original story) might make you think that it's a weak follow-up; but I didn't think so.  I thought it was a lot of fun.  It's the same type of horror-comedy as the first book; not as original in concept but still pretty entertaining.  Brisk story, and Rosemary remains a likeable character.

The first volume, largely a tale of superheroics, tends to put you in mind of Wonder Woman.  But by this volume, the story has morphed into a Madame Blavatsky/Theosophical Society-type occultic quest story.  Two of the Prometheas set out to find the older, fatter Promethea's dead husband in the afterworld. They ascend several of the 10 nodes in the Kabbalist Sefiroth, each of which corresponds to a plane of reality.  They run into Greek and Hindu Gods, Aleister Crowley, Death, various demons, and so forth.  So there's a bunch of discussion about magic and metaphysics along the way, that sort of thing.  <br />The visuals contain several nice special effects, including a moebius-strip path (with inverted and sideways word balloons) and a set of rotating panels that can be read clockwise or counterclockwise.  I guess it's nothing exactly BRILLIANT, but the book demonstrates some neat things you can do with comicbook graphics that you can't do with film or prose.  I think PROMETHEA has the best artwork in any of the ABC Alan Moore series.<br />Some readers might be disappointed by the relative lack of conflict in the story (compared to, say, the first volume).  This is more of an exploration/discovery thing, and a pretty druggy one at that.  A little irritating in a few places, but I thought it was kind of cool.	2004-04-19

Jung Vol.9 Part 2)	Books	4	38	41	N	N	Christian Symbolism and Equilibrium of the Self	I found a lot of this book formidably dense.  Recently I read an introductory book on Jung by psychoanalyst Anthony Storr that sheds some light, even though Storr never specifically mentions AION.  Storr observes a tendency in Jung's thinking to describe the psyche as a self-regulating mechanism, like the human endocrine system.  For example, extraverted activity in the unconscious compensates for introverted activity in the conscious (or vice versa).  Also, a neurosis may be the unconscious's way of compensating for overly one-sided thinking in the conscious.  Similarly, a schizophrenic delusion may be the psyche's (unsuccessful) attempt to restore a lost mental balance.<br />Examples of this balance/compensation principle in AION:<br />(1) The Christ symbol.  It's a symbol of the Self (like most of the symbols and archetypes discussed in the book), but it lacks a Shadow or inferior component; consequently, the early Christians were compelled to generate the Anti-Christ symbol.  However, since the Christ and Anti-Christ are separate entities in traditional Christian thinking, the Western worldview has become highly dualistic and Manichaean, good vs. evil.<br />(2) The God archetype.  As Western thinking has become increasingly secular over the centuries, the God-image has become repressed into the unconscious, where it emerges in savage political forms such as fascism, a worship of the State.  (Jung wrote this a few years after World War II.)<br />(3) Leviathan and Behemoth.  \\"God's monstrous antagonist produces a double because the God-image is incomplete...\\" (pg. 120).<br />(4) Sons of God in Catharist legend:  Satanael the elder son, Christ the younger son.  Similar to the Christ/Anti-Christ dichotomy.<br />(5) The \\"higher\\" and \\"lower\\" Adam figures in some Gnostic legends.  The higher Adam represents higher states of consciousness; the lower Adam, the unconscious.<br />(6) The two thieves crucified with Christ.  One is destined for heaven (higher consciousness),the other for a warmer climate (unconscious).<br />Of course, there's more to the book than this equilibrium-of-the-Self aspect.  But that aspect ties in with the main theme, the process of individuation (or ascending to a higher state of consciousness) in the Western mind.<br />Jung really assaults the reader here with his encyclopedic knowledge of religion and alchemy.  A lot of his later work deals with esoteric subjects (alchemy, gnosticism, hermeticism, kabbalah).  I found a few of the religious subjects, like the medieval \\"Holy Ghost\\" movement, to be pretty interesting in themselves, but unfortunately Jung discusses only those elements that relate to his psychological theories.	2004-03-07

In doing so, the author coins some latin phrases that have since become embedded in the literature on religion:  (1) the NUMINOUS, which is the extra meaning of \\"the Holy\\" beyond simple \\"goodness\\"; and also (2) the MYSTERIUM TREMENDUM, the nature of the numinous, which connotes \\"awefulness\\" (the terror of God or the Other World, which Otto argues is the starting point for the historical development of religion), \\"overpoweringness\\" (in which we feel dwarfed into insignificance), \\"energy\\" (religious fervor), the \\"wholly other\\" (that which is outside the realm of our senses or common experience), and \\"fascination\\" (wonderfulness or grace).<br />This brief summary doesn't really do justice to Otto's description.  Reading the first 70 or so pages of the text, you begin to get his emotional-level understanding of the horrifying, alien, shocks-you-out-of-this-world, yet somehow compelling nature of direct confrontation with the transcendent.  <br />He stretches to describe some of the concepts.  On the element of \\"awefulness\\", for example, he runs through this series of similar concepts:  tremor -> fear -> hallow -> fear of god -> august -> grue -> grisly -> dread -> awe - > daemonic dread -> something uncanny -> eerie -> weird.  <br />Otto relies on a concept he derives from Kant called \\"schematization\\".  He uses it to associate rational ideas with non-rational ideas.  For example, physical sex schematizes \\"love\\"; written or recorded songs schematize \\"musical feeling\\"; the sublime feeling we get from written text or works of art schematizes \\"the Holy\\".  It's important not to confuse the schematization with the thing itself:  so the \\"morally good\\" schematizes \\"the Holy\\", but the \\"morally good\\" is not the Holy.<br />I thought the text bogged down quite a bit after the first 100 pages or so.  He spends three whole chapters arguing with Schleiermacher's concept of \\"Divination\\", for example (it's a type of recognition or gnosis of the Holy).  But the first half is definitely worth reading, though a bit difficult.	2004-01-25
US	52822894	R12JLGQ730RLJ4	0691018332	163885165	The Archetypes and The Collective Unconscious (Collected Works of C.G. Jung Vol.9 Part 1)	Books	4	118	125	N	N	Symbols, Dreams, Mandalas, The Unconscious	It's a book of essays on a theme, like most of his other books.  Here's an attempt to describe the whole theory in a few paragraphs.  Jung suggests the existence of a 3-layered psyche consisting of (1) the conscious (active part of the mind), (2) the personal unconscious (thinking over which we have little or no control), and (3) the collective unconscious (unevolved, animal-instinctive mental activity).  The collective unconscious is &quot;collective&quot; in the sense that humans resemble each other the most at the lowest, biological levels.  &quot;The body's carbon is simply carbon&quot; (pg. 173).  We inherit the collective unconscious from the common pool of human characteristics, like morphological aspects of the body such as arms, legs, etc.<br />The &quot;archetypes&quot; originate in the collective unconscious and are the psychological equivalents of Platonic Forms.  (I realized about halfway through the book that archetype-figures also appear in the personal unconscious, where they're called &quot;complexes&quot;).  The most important archetypes appear to be the Shadow (the inferior aspects of the self which we hide from others), the Anima/Animus (our object(s) of desire), and the Wise Old Man (e.g., teacher, medicine man).  He also discusses a Mother archetype and a Child archetype and indicates the existence of numerous others.  Identifying strongly with an archetype leads to psychosis.<br />The heart of the book is in the first essay, but the rest is useful in fleshing out descriptions and giving examples.  The collective Anima archetype, for instance, can be found among movie stars and in the general pop culture.  Devils and tricksters often represent the Shadow archetype.  Tolkien's Gandalf is a good instance of the Wise Old Man.  It's not so easy to identify a particular individual's Anima complex or Shadow complex.<br />A few things bothered me about the book.  For one, Jung indicates that the &quot;Primitive mentality differs from the civilized chiefly in that the conscious mind is far less developed in scope ... The Primitive cannot assert that he thinks; it is rather that something thinks in him&quot; (pg. 153).  This is a dubious kind of distinction between civilized and uncivilized states of mind that seems to have gone out of fashion over the decades.  Also, I couldn't tell from this book what methodology Jung used to determine the significance of dream symbols.  Does every dream about climbing a tree represent the psyche climbing the &quot;World Tree&quot; toward higher states of consciousness?  Do snakes always represent the unconscious?  Is every old woman in a dream an example of the Mother archetype?  Etc.<br />One of the more interesting and also frustrating essays describes a case study of a woman who paints mandalas over a period of 16-plus years.  Why mandalas?  Jung says the mandala represents the Self, and painting them is useful for determining the contents of the psyche.  He discusses the first dozen or so in detail (reprinted in color), but then glosses over the rest, which came into his hands after the patient had died from cancer!	2004-01-19

Fortunately, the book is partitioned into more or less independent chapters on different subjects, so you don't have to read through the entire thing uninterrupted to avoid losing a particular train of thought.<br />In numerous places, Scholem compares the various schools of Jewish mysticism to Gnosticism.  Like the Gnostics, most of the Kabbalists -- even really strange thinkers like Sabbatai Zevi -- pursued hidden knowledge, rather than faith, as a means of establishing a direct relation with God.  And like the Gnostics, many Kabbalists assumed that the soul of man exists in a state of exile from the true God, as a result of a primordial cosmological imbalance.  The Sabbatians went as far in Gnostical thinking as to assume the existence of two Gods, a hidden one and a revealed one; although the Sabbatians reversed the traditonal Gnostic interpretation by preferring the revealed God (the God of Israel, whom the Gnostics opposed) to the hidden God.  This striking set of similarities between Gnosticism and Jewish mysticism was the strongest impression I came away with from reading the book. <br />I found the Jewish mystics to be a colorful and profound group of thinkers.  While just a bit dry in a few places, this book engagingly describes an impressive, energetic theological tradition.	2004-01-11

I found it very useful in understanding the basic worldview from which a Conservative might operate; and from that, one can make good assumptions as to how Conservatives view Liberals.  Kirk's thinking is profound, his reading extensive, and his arguments well-written.  The major points I took away from this discussion are:<br />1) The Conservative assumes that the design of the world is not by accident, but by transcendental purpose.  Metaphysical, permanent standards of Right and Wrong exist:  moral standards are not relative.  Similarly, the structure of society is not arbitrary.  We should not attempt to alter society using science or social engineering, because we are strictly human, and our understanding is limited.  Change, when it happens, should be modulated in such a way as to limit its effects on society.<br />2) A \\"natural aristocracy\\" exists in any society.  It consists of the best and brightest individuals, and perhaps those born with reserves of wealth.  No legislation or voter majority can eliminate it.  John Adams defines a member of the natural aristocracy (in a Democracy) as anyone who has the power to influence at least one vote other than his own.<br />3) Individuals are born with certain Natural Rights, consisting primarily of property rights.  Government should always act to protect property rights, especially in a Democracy, where the poorest elements of society may employ their voting power to redistribute the possessions of the wealthy few.  A Democracy that gives unmitigated power to the people quickly deteriorates into the worst kind of tyranny.<br />4) Instincts and prejudices frequently have meaning:  the individual may be foolsh, but the species is wise.  The thinking of a few bright persons should not take precedence over tradition.<br />Most of this comes out of Edmund Burke.  The Natural Aristocracy theory is primarily from John Adams.  The dozens of other conservative thinkers that Kirk discusses tend to modify or enhance the thinking of Burke and Adams.  De Tocqueville, for example, sounds the alarm over the potential \\"Tyranny of Democracy\\", but that seems to follow from Burke's thinking on natural rights.<br />I had a few exceptions with some minor points.  Kirk argues, for one, that the American Revolution was somehow a \\"conservative revolution\\"; but I think you could make a more convincing case that it was in fact an Enlightenment-Liberal revolution.  Also, he has a tendency to lump all of the different Liberals and Leftists together into a single agglomeration of \\"Benthamites\\" (after the British utilitarian/socialist philosopher Jeremy Bentham).<br />On the whole, however, I can recommend this one to any reader interested in understanding how people think politically.rs that Kirk discusses tend to modify or enhance the thinking of Burke and Adams.

A better subtitle would be, \\"My favorite CIA Stories\\", or possibly, \\"Adventures, Misadventures, and Hijinx in the Intelligence Community\\".  The actual \\"War on Terror\\" part doesn't even surface until about 2/3 of the way through the book.  Prior to that, the progression of colorful characters (officers, agents, and managers) and events from the 1950s to the present makes this more a collection of anecdotes than a serious discussion of the CIA.<br />Not that some of the anecdotes aren't entertaining in themselves.  Favorites include a description of the CIA's attempt to plant listening devices in insects, birds, and mice (never worked too well); an attempt to humiliate Fidel Castro by dissolving his beard (seriously); the tale of married Russian agents who were heavily into sex parties and wife-swapping (and eventually returned to the USSR); and, my favorite, a Quaker woman who owned property next door to the CIA headquarters, who resisted selling right up to her dying day (age 92), forcing the CIA to build *around* her house (it seems she was from a long line of war protestors -- she had ancestors who did time in prison in the 1700s for resisting the American Revolution).<br />An earlier reviewer points out that the book is extremely George Tenet-partial.  It's possible Tenet is a remarkable leader, but given that the book finds malicious things to say about almost every other director -- describing each variously as control freaks, paranoids, and eccentric incompetents -- it's surprising that the only bad thing the author can find to say about Tenet is that he snacks too much when nervous.<br />So, entertaining in places but not incredibly useful.	2003-12-08

Daschle was a participant in many of the major events described here:  the Gore/Bush split vote, Trent Lott's apologized-and-rightly-so racism debacle, the Jim Jeffords defection, the 9/11 attacks, the anthrax attacks on Daschle's office, the Afghanistan and Iraq war decisions, and of course the dismal Democrat election defeats of 2002.  I came away from each of these chapters impressed by the seriousness and emotional volatility of what was going down.  Most of this stuff was the News to many of us; but to Daschle and other Congressmen, it was a series of almost daily make-or-break crises that had life-shattering and sometimes lethal consequences.<br />A favorite chapter was the account of Daschle's first meeting with George Bush, fascinating if somewhat creepy.  The Senator's view of the President is of course mostly negative, but he also does a fair job of describing Bush's character strengths.  <br />While the mudslinging and character assassinations that go on in national politics is common knowledge, it's disturbing to read about these things from an up-close perspective.<br />It's not all negative.  Daschle describes his thoughts on the function of Congress.  He quotes a history that describes it as &quot;designed by geniuses to be run by idiots&quot;.  Why have both a House and a Senate?  To &quot;cool down&quot; new legislation, like pouring hot coffee into a saucer.<br />The current Congress strikes me as too divisive, though I'm sure that's been the case before.  The Republicans clearly view themselves as the drivers.  When they propose legislation, their approach is *the* approach; Democrats are imbeciles and traitors; divergent views aren't welcome.  Dissenters should be pulverized, not reasoned with.<br />I heard this one on abridged Audio CD.	2003-12-05

Nano-cloning, bio-genetic engineering, the Zoomway, the Whiz Wagon, the Habitat, the Hairies, the Mountain of Judgement, psychedelic photographic montages; something clever and strange jumps up to assault the reader every few pages.<br />One thing I really like about this book over the other Fourth World collections -- like NEW GODS, MISTER MIRACLE, FOREVER PEOPLE -- (besides the color reprinting) is that the stories here don't carry the good-versus-evil, Apokolips/New Genesis allegory baggage.  This one has faster pacing and a more light-hearted feel.  A few minor flaws:  the Newsboy Legion tends to be more annoying than amusing, and the &quot;hippyspeak&quot; used by the Habitat people was never uttered by any human beings outside the pages of JIMMY OLSEN (and maybe THE FOREVER PEOPLE).<br />After DC finishes the Jimmy Olsen stories with the next volume, I would really appreciate it if they could reprint the whole KAMMANDI LAST BOY ON EARTH series.	2003-09-01

This is probably the only political autobiography I've read other than INSIDE THE THIRD REICH by Albert Speer.  While this one is significantly different from Speer's book, some unpleasant government personalities play parts in both stories.<br />At the time this one came out, the focus of attention seemed to be on Hillary's reaction to Bill's infidelity.  While that event certainly plays an important part in the latter part of the book, most of the tale discusses events in the Senator's life from her high school years (as a Goldwater Girl, of all things) on up.  Athough she expresses fury at husband Bill over the &quot;Monica&quot; incident, throughout most of the book she uniformly supports all of the the President's policies (or virtually all) as well as his personal character; so this one isn't necessarily for readers looking for a tell-all soap-opera type story.<br />I found most interesting the political struggles between the Clintons and Congressional Republicans like Newt Gingrich and Tom Delay; the long combat with the story's villain, Ken Starr; the collection of anecdotes about the author, Bill, Chelsea, and pets; some amusing (if unflattering) accounts of prominent Republicans like Gingrich and Strom Thurmond (a lot more stuff on Gingrich, though much of it is well-known from other sources); and the various &quot;I-was-chums-with-famous-people&quot; tales about Jackie Onasis, Tony Blair, Boris Yeltsin, and Stevie Wonder.

It goes on from there to discuss his staggering 100-million dollar win during the Great Crash of 1929 (when so many other investors and traders opted for suicide to curtail their losses) and the steady, tragic disintegration of his family life and trading instincts that followed thereafter.<br />Smitten has produced an entertaining, briskly-moving account of the great trader's life that doesn't require any prior knowledge of the stock market or investing (&quot;speculating&quot; is a better word, as Livermore would put it).

This violent story has an affecting quality that pulls the reader in to experience total identification with the tortured hero.<br />Reading this one reminded me of earlier comics stories that drive the hero right up to the cliff edge of absolute failure, like \\"The Fall of Hank Pym\\" from The Avengers and also \\"The Trial of the Flash\\". Possibly the earliest example of this type of story in the comics goes back to the Carl Barks Duck books, where the ducks repeatedly plunge themselves through some misadventure into a horrifying pit of despair -- often involving the loss of Uncle Scrooge's fabulous wealth -- and must rely on fierce determination and inventiveness to claw their way back out.<br />However, those Duck stories never included drugs, prostitution, beatings, shootings, stabbings, and strangulations to the extent that this Daredevil story does.<br />My one complaint is that Daredevil doesn't face his actual tormentor at the end of the story but instead a hired psychotic; but it's a small flaw in an otherwise impressive story.	2003-04-20

The variety of storytelling styles by the dozens of creators who worked on this book almost guarantees that no reader will like every single story (or, conversely, hate every one).  The types of humor vary widely also:  there's MAD- and PowerPuff Girl-style parodies, Ren-and-Stimpy-type weirdness, also some outright slapstick.  The Kyle Baker story reads exactly like a Chuck Jones cartoon.  One of the Aquaman sketches reads like Spy-Vs-Spy.  A few, like the Eddie Campbell story, manage to be extremely bizarre without being particularly funny.<br />The stories are all 10 pages or less with the exception of the two-part 75-page framing tale involving Mxyzptlk (which is entertaining although not quite as funny as the best of the shorter works).  The creators are generally people who have worked on Vertigo and &quot;indy&quot; comics.	2003-04-06

The photorealistic painting gives the story a unique vivacity.  I've seen fully-painted comics before, but the Norman Rockwell-esque detail and realism here is very impressive, not to mention the attention to light sources.  It's possible to mistake some of the pictures for still photographs of costumed, flying people.  Since each of the several hundred panels in this story looks like it took a week to draw, you wonder how Ross had time to do anything else in his life.	2003-03-31

In the introduction, editor Julie Schwartz is quoted as saying that he tried to get Superman's co-creator Jerry Siegel to write this &quot;final&quot; Superman story, but for some reason he went with Alan Moore instead.<br />Now, Moore has certainly written some great comics, and I'm not really criticizing his work here, but it strikes me as somehow unfair that Schwartz selected the popular British writer over Cary Bates and Elliot Maggin, the two writers who pretty much defined the unique style of the Superman stories of the Julie Schwartz period (1971 - 1986).  Those two wrote dozens, perhaps several dozens, of terrific Superman stories; and they should have been given the honor of this final two-parter.  Moore did a good job, but Bates and Maggin could easily have done as well.<br />At least DC commissioned Curt Swan to draw the thing, before shuffling the great Superman artist off into some depressing comicbook limbo.	2003-03-10

In each of the Heinlein stories, an adolescent hero leaves home to struggle through a series of traumatic and otherwise character-building experiences that ultimately transforms him or her into an adult.  <br />Such things happen in this story to young Halo, who trades in the futilities and disappointments of her childhood Welfare State environment for adventure in outer space -- which of course proves to have futilities and disappointments of its own.<br />The last third of the novel deals with Halo's experiences in the military --like Heinlein's STARSHIP TROOPERS or SPACE CADET -- although Alan Moore's take on space combat is decidedly less gung-ho than Heinlein's.  Closer to Joe Haldeman's THE FOREVER WAR.	2003-03-09

Alan Moore reconstructs the entire Superman mythology with tireless detail, character for character, super-feature for super-feature.  Only the names and appearances have been changed (\\"Supreme\\" = \\"Superman\\", \\"Radar the Dog Supreme\\" = \\"Krypto the Superdog\\"; etc.)       What audience for these stories did Moore have in mind, other than himself and perhaps the odd Superman fanataic?  In addition to Superman and Krypto, we run across analogues of Metropolis, Smallville, the Daily Planet, Perry White, Jimmy Olsen (as Jimmy and Elastic Lad), Clark Kent, Lois Lane, the Fortress of Solitude, Superhorse, Lex Luthor, Braniac, the Phantom Zone Villains, Amazo the power-absorbing android, Ma and Pa Kent, Lana Lang, Supergirl, Superboy (with his tunnel under the Kent house), the Superman robots, the Legion of Superheroes (including Legion clubhouse),  Lori Lemaris (as angel rather than mermaid), the Fortress Super Computer, Kryptonite, both the Justice League and the Justice Society, Batman and Robin (with Batcave), the iffy relationship with Wonder Woman; a few 90's era references, like the Linear Men and the Death of Superman; and some parodies, like Mighty Mouse and MAD's Super-Melvin.    The book doesn't stop short at just imitating the various super-characters and super-gimmicks; it also contains a dozen flashback sequences done in the style of Golden and Silver Age comics (primarily Superman comics, but a few others as well), including Superbaby and Superboy-type stories, JSA and Justice League stories, Lois Lane and World's Finest stories, the venerable \\"3-Part Imaginary Novel\\", and also a few imitations of non-Super comics, such as MAD, E.C. comics, and Neal Adams-era Green Lantern.  (50's/60's Supergirl artist Jim Mooney inks all the flashbacks.)  The \\"modern\\", 90's-style parts of the stories differ from the flashback scenes in drawing style, in dialogue and narrative, and in the inclusion of such special effects as black holes, fractal geometry, and nanotechnology.    For the first few chapters, I wasn't all that thrilled with the overtly imitative quality of the stories.  Easy enough to do homages, hard to do something original.  However, most of the stories are clever, and the characterizations are a notch or so above being outright parodies.  It's sort of a comics version of Oasis doing the Beatles on \\"Supersonic\\" or XTC doing \\"The Mole From the Ministry\\".    As earlier reviews have pointed out, the reproduction leaves a lot to be desired.  The slick paper is very nice, but the artwork all looks like it was scanned in at 600 DPI.  It's readable but somewhat fuzzy.	2003-02-10

Throughout the series, Morrison's references to Gnosticism, Aliester Crowleyian occultism, William Burroughs-type language viruses, general pop culture, '60's psychedelia, drugs, chaos magic, Mexican mysticism, and your odd British politician threaten to weigh the story down through sheer preposterousness, like a really long novel by Thomas Pynchon or Robert Anton Wilson.  But invariably the narrative pulls through and proceeds to get entertaining.    Fortunately, Morrison parcels the obfuscating seven-volume meta-story out to readers in digestible chunks, usually in four-chapter story snippets.  INVISIBLE KINGDOM contains three such snippets, and a final chapter that shows the characters decades in the future (albeit in typically hallucinatory fashion).    My favorite stories from the series include the first 4 chapters of SAY YOU WANT A REVOLUTION (where Jack Frost is initiated into the Barbelo), the single-chapter story \\"Royal Monster\\" from APOCALIPSTICK (where the guy has to feed that creature behind the mirror), Lord Fanny's biography tale (also from APOCALIPSTICK), and the 3-part title sequence from ENTROPY IN THE U.K (which deals with King Mob's interrogation).    Several colorful characters, particularly King Mob, Lord Fanny, Jack Frost, foxy Ragged Robin, and repugnant little Mister Quimper, kept me reading through even the most annoyingly byzantine passages of the series.  However, I could have done without the wearisome Marquis de Sade altogether.  Also, I don't think the time travel aspect was necessary to the story:  I would think the idea of Ragged Robin writing herself into a piece of fiction could have been handled without the time-warping aspects, which only added to the confusion.  And I wasn't completely clear on the significance of Jack Frost's Messianic status, which is hinted atthroughout the series but not resolved to my satisfaction in the final volume.  Also, I've completely lost track of the significance of that green hand.    Of course, I can recommend this last volume only to those readers who have read the previous six; you really don't want to pick this story up at the end.  I can certainly recommend the whole series, however.  This sort of thing has been done in books before (Pynchon, R.A. Wilson, and Philip K. Dick being examples) but not, I think, in comics.	2003-01-13

Apparently DOOM PATROL was a cult favorite back in the 60's, but its reputation has been obscure enough to discourage any sort of systematic reprinting up until this book.  In a pointless lifetime of reading comics, this is the first time I've run across the original series.<br />DC benefited from a number of excellent pencil artists back in the 1960's, such as Curt Swan, Neal Adams, and Murphy Anderson.  Bruno Premiani is a name that never seems to appear in that list, but it really should.  The artwork here is really impressive, comparable in places to Alex Raymond or Lou Fine.   <br />The Arnold Drake stories are also consistently entertaining, although you have to get used to a style of dialogue and characterization that smacks strongly of 50/60's-era horror and science fiction films.  But the writing is at least as good as anything being done in that period at Marvel or DC.  In some ways the storytelling reminds me of some non-superhero DC titles from the time, like STRANGE ADVENTURES or MYSTERY IN SPACE.<br />Highly recommended to anyone who likes Silver Age comics.	2002-12-03
US	52822894	RF3J5XL68KCPR	1580624200	5820841	The Quotations of Chairman Greenspan: Words from the Man Who Can Shake the World	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Acquire Non-Diminutive Cognizance of Greenspanisms	Morbid curiosity drove me to open this book.  I suppose I expected to find some sort of arch-conservative, Reaganite-Republican, Ayn-Randian, ultra-capitalist dogmatist.  But the figure that actually emerges is that of a dedicated, technical-minded civil servant.<br />The book contains selections from different Greenspan speeches given over the years.  Most selections are prefixed with some scene-setting remarks by the author, Kahaner.  The book doesn't have much structure to it -- the chapters are in alphabetical order (e.g., \\"Banks\\", \\"Capitalism\\", \\"Derivatives\\", etc).  So you can skip back and forth without losing anything.<br />While Greenspan's speaking style is usually clear, he does have a roundabout way of talking.  For example:  \\"I don't want to suggest we're about to do anything at this stage, but I would confirm we are obviously going to do a great deal of thinking about the whole process.\\"  Somewhere else, he jokes:  \\"I've been able to string more words into fewer ideas than anybody I know, and I'm continuing to do that.\\"<br />Nonetheless, the reader can pick up most of Greenspan's opinions without too much trouble.  For example:  (a)Debt - bad.  (b)Inflation - very, very bad.  (c)Capitalism - hurray!  His view  on income distribution:  \\"No society succeeds unless virtually all of its participants believe that it's fair and gives people opportunities.\\"  That one sounded all right to me, but his views on labor strike me as downright creepy; for example:  \\"It should always be remembered that in economies where dismissing a worker is expensive, hiring one will also be perceived to be expensive.\\"  <br />On a subject of current political concern, the privatization of Social Security (or \\"modernization\\" is what they're calling it now, I think), Greenspan argues against it for workers already contributing to the system:  \\"Investing Social Security assets in equities is largely a zero sum game.\\"  But he also suggests that allowing younger workers the option to move to a semi-privatized plan might be practical.<br />Greenspan maintains a pretty aloof tone in most of his speeches.  For example, while touring the economically devastated region of South Central Los Angeles, he dryly observes, \\"We regulators are swamped with all sorts of data... It's important to put a face on the numbers.\\"  On the matter of dealing with others:  \\"...beyond the personal sense of satisfaction, having a reputation for fair dealing is a profoundly practical virtue.  We call it 'good will' in business and add it to our balance sheets.\\"<br />A section near the end of the book contains remarks others have made about Greenspan.  One economist sums it up best:  \\"When Greenspan dies his headstone could read:  'I am guardedly optimistic about the next world, but remain cognizant of the downside risk.'\\"	2002-11-17

It's short, eerie, amusing, and has a punch to the storytelling you certainly won't find in, say, SOLARIS.  I noticed that a number of the reviews already posted have given away the essential plot twist in the story; I'll try to avoid doing so myself.<br />For the most part, the story is part of the &quot;Sleeper&quot; (after Woody Allen) genre, like Frederik Pohl's AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT (and, to an extent, Heinlein's DOOR INTO SUMMER), where the main character wakes from cryogenic slumber to the world of the future.  After learning to navigate through the new environment, he finds the governments of the world have solved some of the worst social problems that were on the horizon of the 20th century, such as overpopulation, pollution, and urban blight.  But things turn out to be not really quite so nice as they appear, once he bothers to look below the surface.<br />The final, silly twist at the end of the story is far inferior to the major the one that precedes it, and I'm almost tempted to take off a star.  But otherwise it's highly recommended.	2002-10-29

They're not going to lay people off and have to pay those pesky unemployment benefits, they're just going to reap the harmless and friendly windfall of attrition.  It's like 1,000 people or so at this company are going to wake up one day and, for no particular reason, just up and decide to get new jobs or whatever!  Hey, what a great deal for the company!  Such a great deal!    Of course, what many of us who have undergone the attrition process learn is that a company actively encourages people to volunteer to quit their jobs.  Or perhaps some managers want to encourage certain employees they don't particularly like to quit -- with the implicit collusion of upper management.  And of course this encouragement usually takes the form of insults, threats, humiliations, blackmail, manipulations, treachery, harrassment, gangings-up-on, behind-the-back criticisms, \\"one-on-one\\" meetings with concerned managers, and various other forms of encouragement.  You can complain, of course, but whomever at the company you want to complain to feels, well, they really have to side with Management on this one -- it must be all YOUR fault.    Even the most arrogant and self-secure can have bad feelings about such experiences months or even years after the fact.  Rage, frustation, grinding teeth, revenge fantasies -- these are your only true pals (it seems).    Unfortunately, some people suffer a lot more than feelings of protracted anger.  This books describes cases where workers have been rewarded with long-term depression, heart attacks, and even suicide.  Management excels at making their mistakes and their policies look like YOUR fault.  The most conscientious workers get it the worst, since they actually care enough about their work to take all the criticism seriously.  It's a weeding-out of the best, most productive people.    I highly recommend this book to everyone who works for any company or organization.  The authors spell out in satisfying detail exactly what sort of abuses go on at companies (borderline legal abuse and otherwise).  They also discuss the underlying causes that motivate Mobbing:  \\"attrition\\" is one I discussed above, but job competition, personal dislike, and power politics are also factors.  They also discuss how to recognize when it's happening, and what you can do (although I'm afraid getting another job pretty much tops the short list of recommended actions).	2002-10-16

Of the three little Chomsky books in \\"The Real Story\\" series, I found WHAT UNCLE SAM REALLY WANTS to be the most impressive.  For the most part, the book focuses on the idea that the United States has for decades opposed the development of governments and economies in the Third World that are ideologically different from our own, particularly when such governments and economies improve the quality of life for the masses.  Chomsky argues that such opposition is, in fact, the sum of all U.S. foreign policy.<br />For example, Chomsky points out that when El Salvador in the 1970s experienced a growth of \\"peasant associations, cooperatives, unions\\" and similar socialist-type organizations, the U.S. moved right in to radically destabilize the government by installing our own dictators who suppressed the population using repression, torture, and murder.<br />Early on, to explain the rationale behind America's oppressive foreign policy, Chomsky cites a 1950s State Department official named Kennan:  \\"...we have 50% of the world's wealth, but only 6.3% of its population... We should cease to talk about vague and ... unreal objectives such as human rights ... The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts.\\"<br />Later on, Chomsky argues that our government regarded the real threat of the USSR during the Cold War to be its Communist system, not its military strength.  (I found that one part a bit hard to believe, thinking back to my own childhood when I used to imagine all sorts of Russian nuclear warheads targeted on my home in sunny Phoenix.)  He observes, more convincingly, that the U.S. and Soviet Union spent most of the Cold War in name-calling, the Russians pointing out our atrocities in the Third World and oppression within our borders just as we accused them of the same (perhaps rightly so, in both cases).  When Russia ceased to be an ideological threat, Chomsky argues, our government manufactured a \\"War On Drugs\\" as an excuse to continue its brutal subversion of Third World governments.<br />I found the discussion of propaganda at the end of the book to be the most interesting.  For example, neither the U.S. nor the Soviet Union ever used the term \\"socialism\\" in a factual context.  In the USSR, socialism was regarded as a good thing, so calling their government a Union of Socialist Republics helped to justify the existence of the government and its authoritarian (i.e., non-socialist) policies.  In the U.S. socialism was regarded as a bad thing, so our government could use the term to \\"defame the feared libertarian ideals\\" by associating them with oppressive, evil, communist Russia.<br />On the whole, it's a pretty interesting book, and one well worth reading during this period of \\"War On Terrorism\\".	2002-09-15
US	52822894	R1C1N5Y1TU6DBS	0812693906	127294983	The Ayn Rand Cult	Books	4	24	35	N	N	Enjoyable Book About Some Strange People	As novelists go, Ayn Rand has certainly had a significant impact on people's thinking.  According to Walker, her books sell a quarter million copies or more per year, decades after publication.  I discovered from this book that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of our Federal Reserve, was a dedicated, meeting-attending Randian loyalist back in the 1960s, and still admires her philosophy today.<br />So it's both disconcerting and eerily funny to find out what an odd bunch the Objectivists were (and are).  The chapters on psychologist (or \\"psychological theorist\\") Nathaniel Branden and Ayn Rand Institute leader Leonard Peikoff in particular are laughing-out-loud funny in several places.  According to Walker, Branden claimed to have read THE FOUNTAINHEAD 40 times by his early twenties; Peikoff had read the book 60 times by 1989, but needed to squeeze in a 61st reading for inspiration to finish his book OBJECTIVISM:  THE PHILOSOPHY OF AYN RAND.  Branden's name is actually \\"Blumenthal\\", but he changed it to \\"Branden\\" (an anagram of \\"ben Rand\\") after Ayn Rand changed his life.  <br />The chapter on Branden is a bit darker, however.  Walker traces the origin of the cult to him (originally, the group called itself the Nathaniel Branden Institute); and he accuses Branden, the group's official psychologist, of damaging the psyches of most of the inner-circle Objectivists with his counseling -- and all of the Objectivists around Rand apparently required a great deal of counseling.  After Rand ejected him from the group for infidelity, Branden went on to make a career writing books on, ironically, Self-Esteem.<br />Maybe, as some of the reviewers here have noted, Walker has a bit of an axe to grind against Peikoff or Branden or both (by contrast, his remarks toward reformer David Kelley are positively friendly).  But the book as a whole is formidably documented, and he certainly makes a convincing case against them. <br />None of the Objectivists comes out looking too hot in this book.  According to Walker, no disagreement with any of Rand's beliefs was tolerated in either the Branden Institute or the Ayn Rand Institute, because Rand was the greatest philosopher of the last 2500 years (at least).  As with other cults, the group meetings monopolized everyone's free time.  Everybody smoked, because Rand smoked.  Nobody liked Immanuel Kant, because Rand didn't like him.  Not much room for humor, either, because Objectivism is a truly serious matter.  ATLAS SHRUGGED is not just a good novel, it is \\"the greatest achievement in human history\\".  <br />The last few chapters in the book do a pretty convincing job tracing Objectivism's influences to Nietzsche, Rand's Jewish background, 1920s economic theory, and various early 20th century novelists.<br />I can recommend this book to anyone who's read one of Rand's novels (or perhaps part of one) or knows someone strongly affected by her thinking.  But it might enrage truly dedicated fans.	2002-09-08

Chomsky argues that the purpose behind NAFTA (a new deal at the time the book was published) was to open up Mexico to American industries searching for cheap labor.  Since the standard of living in Mexico is lower than in the U.S., and since the workers don't benefit from the same civil rights, NAFTA gives U.S. companies access to a virtually unlimited source of what amounts to slave-employees.  Of course, Mexico isn't the only 3rd World nation to experience such U.S. incursions; we have a commercial (and military) presence in a  number of nations in South America, Asia, and Africa.  U.S. taxpayers categorically foot the bill for the costs of opening up the foriegn territories for U.S. interests (particulary where military invasions are involved, such as in Colombia), but the companies alone reap the benefits of the cheap labor.  And any resulting layoffs here at home (part of the cost reduction) puts a drain on the unemployment fund, which also comes out of our taxes.<br />Chomsky also points out how U.S. and state governments routinely grant subsidies to businesses (another drain on taxes), effectively instituting welfare for corporations.  He notes that the economic structure in the U.S. is slowly evolving toward the model of the 3rd World, where most of the money lies in the hands of a few individuals, the vast majority of the population consists of the working poor, and the governments invariably support the interests of the upper classes.  <br />Chomsky's spoken word album FREE MARKET FANTASIES discusses some of these same subjects.  I don't know if I agree completely with all of Chomsky's views, but it certainly makes me want to dig up more information on the subjects.  Thought-provoking, engaging, and quick to read.	2002-09-05

The story resembles the film ALIENS in some ways, and also the Niven-Pournelle-Barnes novel LEGACY OF HEOROT; although this novel predates those other stories by a few decades.  A better way to describe it is to call it a horror novel in a Perry Rhodan vein, for those of you who are old enough and pathetically geeky enough to benefit from that reference.  It employs many elements of space opera:  laser guns, antimatter cannon, force fields, atomic combat, and other such special effects commonly found in Perry Rhodan and Doc Smith's LENSMAN.  But this one has a much creepier tone to it than what you'd expect from space opera.<br />The theme to the book is similar to that of other Lem novels, like SOLARIS and THE INVESTIGATION, where the heroes find themselves up against increasingly complex and frustrating phenomena.  I liked this one better than those two, however.  Recommended, but you'll have to look to find a copy.	2002-08-12

But the strengths exceed the flaws.  The story itself, once you get past the first 20% or so, is darn clever.  And all of the characters are memorable, particularly Jerry Cruncher (who's certain his wife is prayin' agin' him), Sydney Carton (self-pitying perpetual first-rate loser), and cold, cunning Madame Defarge (French, of course).<br />I heard this one on unabridged cassette, by the way.  ....

The word &quot;Gravity&quot; doesn't really explain anything, rather it gives a name to the tendency of objects to fall toward the center of the earth.  If something like that happens every day, we give it a name of some sort and accept it as normal.  If something like that seldom happens, then it's exceptional and warrants investigation.<br />Although I was dissatisfied with the ending, the reasoning employed along the way there is pretty engrossing.  The story is also strange enough in places to be bleakly humorous.  Maybe an extra half-star, for being different.	2002-08-05

Dick say that the one most important piece of knowledge he had picked up from philosophy is that, \\"The nature of reality is to disguise its true nature\\" (which he claimed to have read in Heraclitus, though it's difficult to be sure if Heraclitus actually said that).<br />TIME OUT OF JOINT is one of Dick's earlier novels that treats the theme of \\"The World Is Not What We Think It Is\\" explicitly.  It's a novel about knowledge and recognition.  The characters play parts in a detective story where the mystery involves piecing together missing parts of the world.  Some of the clues include finding light switches on the wrong side of the door, finding a note where a lemonade stand used to be, finding pictures of some actress nobody's ever heard of, and seeing visions.<br />A number of PKD's later books involved more significant permutations of this theme of Nature-In-Disguise.  This story is like a one-trick pony in comparison to books like PALMER ELDRITCH, NOW WAIT FOR LAST YEAR, UBIK, MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE, MAZE OF DEATH, or VALIS.  But the gradual accumulation of evidence, the dawning of recognition in the main characters, makes for pretty fascinating reading.  <br />For good or ill, several modern film makers have really taken this motif to heart (e.g., Dark City, The Matrix, The 13th Floor, The 6th Sense, etc.).	2002-07-17

I was never completely sure if he was making this all up in his mind or if it was really happening to him.  He spends most of his time in the book trying to contact the one remaining psychologist on earth; and the dwindling psychologist problem is another intriguing idea that doesn't seem to go anywhere.  Ditto for the Nazi official who's brought forward in time, I forget to what purpose.  The same for the Mars-colonization supplier that specializes in lifelike robots that function as your friendly neighbors for those lonely, desolate Martian locations (just a little reminiscent of the \\"Perky Pat\\" episode from PALMER ELDTRITCH, although this story never really gets off the Earth).  And the papoolas, what was the point there?<br />Although most of Dick's novels have a lot of humor in them, this one seems to take nothing seriously.  It's difficult to get involved with the characters.  Everything that happens seems like a joke.  The novel has several interesting scenes, but the work as a whole is not one of Dick's better efforts.	2002-07-11

I listened to the unabridged audio tape version of this book narrated by Michael Page.  It's one of those deals where you listen to each tape entirely on the left channel, then play the whole tape again on the right channel to get the next part of the story.  Which is kind of awkward, since you forget which channel you were on if you also use your stereo for music; but these editions are probably the least expensive (by the hour) audio tapes you can buy.<br />I think Dickens' tendency toward exhaustive descriptions works a lot better when you're listening to it in the car than when you're reading it in print.  I might never have had the patience to read the actual book while sitting in a chair, but listening to it in the car was pretty entertaining.  Colorful characters, humor, suspense, unexpected plot twists; I can picture a lot of it in my mind even now.  A recommended story.	2002-07-03

It's not as accessible as BLOOD MUSIC (his other really good one), but in many ways it's more impressive.  A reviewer's blurb on the cover of my paperback edition calls it &quot;...possibly the most ambitious novel ever written...&quot; which sounds like the most ridiculous hyperbole, but I wouldn't call it completely off the mark.<br />For some reason, the author wrote several sections in a deliberately obtuse fashion, which forced me to reread the first couple pages of many chapters.  I haven't quite figured out the intent behind this literary &quot;technique&quot;, but plowing through the difficult parts of this one actually pays off.<br />The novel's obsessive focus on the themes of crime and punishment (mostly punishment), looked at from the perspectives of different characters in different situations, impressed me much the same way Frederik Pohl's novel GATEWAY did (which dealt with the themes of survival and guilt).  It really sticks with you after reading it.	2002-07-03

I think the 20-page story format (introduced in the late 60s when the strip switched from TALES OF SUSPENSE to CAPTAIN AMERICA) gives the stories more elbow room than the 10-page chapters I suffered through in the previous volume.  The narrative approach in this one is much more visual and less wordy.  The pacing is smoother.  And the stories have a bit more complexity to them beyond Captain America kicking ... out of the Red Skull and Batroc while lecturing them on the virtues of Truth, Justice, Determination, and so forth (although there's still a fair amount of that here (it's Captain America, after all)).  <br />I don't think more than a few stories in this 500+ page volume have been reprinted anywhere before; not in the Marvel Masterworks format and not in the 70's era MARVEL DOUBLE FEATURE reprint comic I read sometimes as a kid.  So this is 99% new material for the majority of us (unless you actually have some of the original comics).<br />A common complaint with the Marvel Essentials books has to do with the black-and-white format.  While most of the artwork here looks pretty good in black and white (particularly the fluid, eyeball-soothing Gene Colan work that dominates the second half of the book), I've noticed that over the last year or so Marvel has changed the paper they use on this series from a bright white color to a dull white or light gray.  Black-and-white reprinting of color comics is usually acceptable to me, but black-and-light-gray reprinting really begins to push the envelope.  Since the Essentials volumes are still the best value (per pound) in comicbook reprints, I suppose I shouldn't critique this one point too much.  But I recommend using a strong light.	2002-05-20

Also, the beginning of the story is a bit jarring, since we appear to be dropped into the middle of a tale begun by the previous creative team.  But the story gets better as it goes along.  The main character, Captain Britain, seems very dull to me, but some of the supporting characters, including the primary antagonist, are original enough to be interesting.<br />While Alan Davis's pencil work here isn't quite as smooth and proportional as it becomes later in his career, it's still pretty appealing.<br />Despite all the little criticisms above, I thought it was a very engaging comics story (once you get past the first three or four chapters) with a lot of energy and a quirky, &quot;Dr. Who meets the Terminator&quot; type feel to it.  But before buying the book, take into account that this isn't really prime Alan Moore or prime Alan Davis.	2002-04-29

Crisp, remastered (\\"Theakstonized\\"), black-and-white reprints of 40's-era Jack Kirby (and Joe Simon) comics highlight this volume, although there's a couple dozen pages of historical discussion about Kirby's life and career, as well.  This volume (#2) contains several Blue Bolt stories, four or five Fawcett Comics Captain Marvel (Shazam!) stories, and a slew of various other strips from 1940 and 1941 (just prior to the time Kirby and Simon left comics to fight in World War II).  Some of the better-known works from that period, like the Captain America and Vision stories (which are now owned by Marvel Comics) have been left out of this volume.<br />Many comics readers do not care for Golden Age comics at all, and if that is the case for you, then this collection may not be your cup of tea.  For my own part, I liked the Blue Bolt stories best:  they have a cool Buck Rogers / Flash Gordon feel that you won't find in the Simon-Kirby Captain America stories from the same period of time. <br />I think Theakston put a lot of effort into producing this volume.  The reprinting here is a lot kinder on my eyeballs than the similar black-and-white reprints you can find in the less expensive Marvel Essentials collections.  However, you may find the price prohibitive, not to mention the relative obscurity of the reprinted material.	2002-04-29

Dick novel.  The characters resemble Philip Dick characters (my favorite is the guy with the obsession for Frank Miller DAREDEVIL comics):  the protagonists are alienated misfits, the antagonists are mostly government authorities and wealthy people.  The setting involves an oppressive regime in a slightly alternate world that nonetheless strongly resembles the contemporary United States.  Paranoia genuinely bubbles out of the plot, and of course weird, metaphysical stuff happens toward the end of the story.<br />Philip Dick and his novels are subjects of discussion among the characters.  PKD himself appears in the story (\\"Horsy Stout\\"), as he does in his own novels RADIO FREE ALBEMUTH and VALIS; although here he's more in the background.<br />Most of the novel retains the eerie, bleak, surreal edge that you can find in many PKD novels.  I didn't like the ending quite as much as the first 90% of the story; but I can say that many of the PKD novels tend to disintegrate toward the end as well (e.g., DO ANDROIDS DREAM and PALMER ELDRITCH).  But the ending to this one is harder to take seriously.  And the whole thing's a bit too long (340 pages), considering that most of the PKD novels run to about 200 pages and never exceed 300 (not his science fiction).<br />On the whole, it's an entertaining psuedo-Dick novel.  I haven't read anything else by Michael Bishop, but he certainly has done competent work with this story, I think.	2002-04-24

Tragic, brutal things happen to the characters in these plays.  But none of these people is particularly likeable, so you can't really care.  It's all just as well for them, in some ways, and it's all in good fun.  The characters manipulate each other, lie to each other, steal from each other, screw each other, kill each other, and deny that they do it.  Everyone here has the ethics of a doorknob, and it's all pretty enjoyable.<br />The last one, \\"What The Butler Saw\\", got a little bit too ridiculously farcical for my taste and went on too long, but it has its moments; and otherwise they're all pretty good to read.<br />I can also recommend the introduction.  Joe Orton lived his own life very much like the people in his plays (which makes you wonder how much of his material was supposed to be comedy).  Even his death was true to form:  his envious lover, actor Kenneth Halliwell, bashed in Orton's brains with a hammer just prior to doing himself in with 22 sleeping tablets.	2002-04-18

It's not a sequel in the sense that it follows on the events of THE BIRTH CAUL (were there any events in THE BIRTH CAUL?).  Rather, it's a sequel in that it's by the same creators, has the same length, is written and drawn in the same style, and uses the same expository tone of voice that THE BIRTH CAUL uses.  Like its predecessor, this one has no actual story, but functions as a type of artistic &quot;statement&quot;.<br />The earlier work had some interesting points, but I went into this one frowning and came out frowning.  Something about the nature of art and how it's related to magic.  According to the credits page, SNAKES AND LADDERS was originally presented live to the Society of the Golden Dawn, so parts of the book may have something to do with the philosophy of that particular, um, fellowship of believers, but I couldn't get enough out of it to figure out what's what.<br />It might be more interesting to people who haven't already read THE BIRTH CAUL, but I got tired of it pretty quickly.  I'm not sure if Moore and Campbell intend to make a series out of these things, but if so, this is as far as I'm going.  Well, maybe.	2002-04-16

There was that Steven Bocho cop-drama-musical show that didn't last very long (I forget its name).  Now we have TOP TEN.<br />This series gives Alan Moore the opportunity to make fun of both cop dramas and superhero comics.  However, it is definitely good-spirited fun, not savage parody:  people who like cop dramas or superheroes (or both) can still enjoy these stories, I think.  Somewhere I read Moore say that one of the pleasures of comic books is that you can create stories about worlds where readers take for granted that entities as unrelated as Superman and the Swamp Thing coexist and may occasionally meet each other.  We have a lot of that here, where gritty, ugly street crimes and tragedies exist alongside an entire population of costumed, super-powered citizens.<br />I should also point out that the Gene Ha pencil work is very nice on the eyeballs.  His fine, meticulous drawing style is essential in portraying the dozens of bizarre characters as well as the realistic, detailed backgrounds.<br />Of the three ABC collections I've read (the others being PROMETHEA and TOM STRONG, both also by Moore), this is by far the best.	2002-04-14

A short (56 pages) Grant Morrison story that contains neither superheroes nor science fiction.  The plot is similar to that of NATURAL BORN KILLERS, where 2 youngsters run off to take drugs and kill people.  Like that film, this story is also a dark comedy, although this one takes a more aloof and antiseptic tone than the film did.  The tale gets much of its energy from its complete and matter-of-fact disregard of any ethics or morality.<br />Philip Bond's colorful artwork contibutes a lot toward the dry humor in this story.  He draws people's faces and their expressions quite well, which is particularly useful in the numerous asides to the reader, where the girl looks directly out of the page and talks to you.  It reminds me of some movies that have used this device.<br />Although not the greatest Grant Morrison story ever written, it's a malignant little comic with a certain charm, and worth reading if you can find a copy somewhere.	2002-04-14

These are the same creators who brought us the excellent FROM HELL, but the BIRTH CAUL doesn't resemble that story much.  It has no real characters or plot; and if there's an argumentative point it makes, I can't say what the point is.  <br />That's not to say it's all bad, or even mostly bad.

The book's format resembles those CEREBUS phonebook collections:  a huge mass of black and white comics, with liberal use of heavy blacks for inking effects.  Unlike CEREBUS, the focus here is on regular folks living in a contemporary metropolis.<br />I read through this intimidating heap of pages pretty quickly.  There's something funny on virtually every page, although there's also tragedy and drama.  The book's strong points are the characters and their dialog.  A few of the characters seem unlikable, when they're introduced; but by the end of the story, I liked all of them (except the psycho murderer, maybe).  At the end, I felt relieved for some and sad for others.  Those I liked best at the beginning weren't in all cases the ones I liked best near the end.<br />It's a book that makes you think hard about people you know or knew, and about how you yourself appear to other people.

This book, a story about a TV repairman and his family in 1950's California, contains many of the elements contained in Dick's science fiction novels:  bleak emotional landscapes; the aggressive wife; the everyman character stuggling to get by in the world.   But it's missing the inventiveness, the creepiness, and also the humor of his SF work.  This one dragged for me, a bit, though it does contain some memorable characters.  <br />This is one of several non-science fiction novels Dick wrote in the 1950s in an attempt to gain recognition as a serious writer.  It didn't work (while he was still living), and he went back to solid SF at some point.  This one is worth reading for sure if you like PKD, but it's not up there with his very best science fiction.	2002-04-10

I've been looking for a Religious Studies type book on Buddhism.  I've read a couple D.T. Suzuki books like that on Zen Buddhism, but THE STORY OF BUDDHISM here is the first single critical/historical text I've found on the subject of The Whole Buddhist Thing.<br />I agree with the earlier review titled &quot;Not The Best Introduction&quot; that the text glosses over a lot of issues that could really benefit from more explanation.  The author blazes through the 5 Aggregates of Attachment and the 4 Noble Truths in about as many pages.  Zen gets a whole 7 pages.  There's actually more stuff in my encyclopedia on Nagarjuna, the Void school, and the Yogacara school than I could find here.<br />I suppose that's what happens when you try to compress such a vast subject into a 250 page discussion.  For me, the book was a memory-refresher on the few subjects I already knew something about, but not a good explanation of unfamiliar material.  There's a helpful glossary at the end of the book, however.	2002-04-10

I have to agree with one of the earlier reviewers that this would have been a better book if it had stopped halfway through. In the first half, we are introduced to the eerie world of the Invisibles from the perspective of the young Jack Frost protagonist, with whom we can relate (obnoxious as he might be). <br />But the second half of the book suffers from jarring time travel sequences, high gross-out content, arcane conversations, and a lack of sympathetic characters. The Marquis de Sade is, I think, *intended* to be such a viewpoint character, but I found him too strange and off-putting to have much sympathy for him. And the Invisibles themselves already seem to know everything.<br />That said, I have to conclude that it's a very ambitious and engrossing book nonetheless. The high point for me was Jack Frost's initiation to the Barbelo and whatnot, at the end of the 4th chapter. That had me really hooked, despite the fact that things got less interesting as the story went on.<br />I can definitely recommend this book to people who liked THE ILLUMINATUS! TRILOGY and some of the more paranoid Philip K. Dick novels; that sort of thing.	2002-04-08

I was hesitant to leave a review for this book, since 36 people have already done so before me.  But I had to!  It's probably my favorite novel.<br />Although the first 50 pages or so might make you think of this as  a science fiction adventure about telepaths and terrorists, the story subsequently becomes rather ... um, weird.  It's a chilling study of reality.  People who have seen the film The Matrix will doubtless see how much that film borrows from Dick's sensibility, particularly in terms of this novel.<br />The book is somewhere between horror and science fiction.  Dick's interest in Gnosticism, the Kaballah, and Jungian psychology all factor into this nightmare-like story.  Other Dick novels with a flavor similar to UBIK's include THREE STIGMATA OF PALMER ELDRITCH, MAZE OF DEATH, and VALIS.  That's probably an overly short list, however, since most of his books deal with reality and metaphysics in some sense or another.<br />Five stars for sure, but for God's sake use only as directed.	2002-04-07

You won't learn that much practical knowledge of calculus or physics from this 170-page volume; however, you will get a lot of tasty info on Newton's life, his theories, his conflicts, and his eccentricities.<br />I found particularly interesting the fact that Newton wrote as many words about alchemy and other occult subjects as he did about mechanics and calculus.  His notion of &quot;action at a distance&quot; (e.g., gravitational attraction), for example, was probably inspired by his alchemical research.<br />Also, it's a shame Newton decided to spend his later years running the British Mint, wanting do something more useful with himself than perform further research!<br />I also enjoyed the author's brief polemic against Galileo, apparently one of the most obnoxious takers of credit in the history of ideas.<br />It's a fun book, and informative.  I may track down a few of the others mentioned in the bibliography.	2002-04-04

Tom Strong, a comicbook version of Doc Savage, manages to be tongue-in-cheek without being very funny.  Fortunately, it doesn't take long to read through this book, since not a great deal happens.  Moore has written a lot better elsewhere, both with superheroes and without.	2002-04-04
US	52822894	R1D4RP7LH7KDLY	0785107401	791063674	Essential Captain America, Vol. 1 (Marvel Essentials) (v. 1)	Books	2	0	4	N	N	Looks cool, but it's disappointing	I snatched this one up when it first came out, since I had read reprints of some of this material in other places and wanted to see more of it.  Unfortunately, the parts I'd read earlier (approx. the first 150 pages of this book) are about as good as it gets.<br />The list of comics creators who worked on this series is impressive -- including Jack Kirby, Gil Kane, and Stan Lee -- but ultimately it seems like they were just meeting deadlines and paying bills.  The Kirby stories are the best; some of the others were completely unreadable for me.  I'm hoping the second volume of CAPTAIN AMERICA reprints contains better work.	2002-04-03
US	52822894	R1PJQFE1VHTWQR	0334024501	845746481	Ancient Christian Gospels: Their History and Development	Books	4	39	43	N	N	About 40 Years of Research Packed Into 400 Pages	This book is loaded with tables and footnotes.  It's an excruciatingly detailed study of the various New Testament gospels and related sources.  You'll find a detailed breakdown of the derivation of the Q synoptic sayings source from Luke and Matthew; comparisons between lost gospels like the Gospel of Peter and the Gospel of Thomas and the canonical texts; a study of the birth accounts; a catalog of the Jesus stories; a bunch of other stuff.<br />I found it slow going, but it's amazing how much obscure knowledge you can glean from reading through this.  I wouldn't recommend it as an introductory text on the Gospels, however.	2002-04-02

Dick	Books	5	33	34	N	N	Only Apparently Real	This is Lawrence Sutin's best book (well, of the three that I've read).  It's also the best book on Dick I've found, and it's about as engrossing as some of Dick's better novels.  There's a lot of stuff in here, but I wolfed it down pretty quickly.<br />The various troubled relationships, paranoid experiences (and attitudes), drug experimentation, and transcendental experiences are discussed here in some detail.  We get lots of stories from Dick's ex-wives and such discussing his writing habits and nervous behavior.<br />I found particularly helpful the bibliography (with plot summaries) at the end of the book.  It's depressing how much of Dick's work is still out of print.<br />A great book on a great American writer.  Anyone who wants to go further might look at IN SEARCH OF VALIS, also by Sutin.	2002-04-02
US	52822894	R2NTN60YJBXZ4G	1563896117	691933311	1: Hawkman: The Archives - Volume One (Archive Editions (Graphic Novels))	Books	5	19	19	N	N	Some of the Best 60s Superhero Comics	The Gardner Fox / Joe Kubert Hawkman stories are among my all-time favorite comics.  Each story contains a different science fiction premise, like most of Fox's stories, but here we also get his two best characters, Katar and Shayera (Hawkman, Hawkgirl).  Much of Fox's work suffers from some perfunctory characterization and dialogue, but his Hawk-folks communicate a unique charm that reminds me a bit of the Thin Man films.  I don't think there's a more convincing and effective partnership in a married couple anywhere else in comics.    Of course, it helps that Joe Kubert illustrates most of these stories.  Kubert is probably better known for his Tarzan and DC war comics work, but this book contains some of his best.  The artwork is comparable to and reminiscent of Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon strips (and you'll notice how much Hawkman's uniform resembles Flash's).  I don't mean to slight the Murphy Anderson artwork that appears later in the volume; I like Anderson also, but the Kubert stuff really stands out.	2002-04-01
US	52822894	R2HZQIBZRBF8JX	1563896257	402132883	Justice League of America - Archives, Volume 6 (Archive Editions (Graphic Novels))	Books	5	18	18	N	N	Essential Gardner Fox / Mike Sekowsky	I read the 6th Volume most recently, but this review might apply to the entire JLA ARCHIVES series.  The stories in the series improve a bit as time goes on, but the difference from volume to volume is barely perceptible.<br />You'll have trouble finding a more colorful and bizarre collection of popcorn-science-fiction concepts in any novel or collection of stories; not in comics, not in Larry Niven or in Isaac Asimov, none of those guys.  The characters and dialog may seem awkward and stilted (even by the standards of 1960's comics writing), but the inherent weirdness and originality blazes right on through.  <br />With the possible exception of Stan Lee, Gardner Fox is the single most influential writer in American comics.  In addition to the Justice League, he created The Flash, The Atom, Hawkman, and the 1940's Justice Society of America (and numerous others I can't think of right now).  Along with editor Julius Schwartz, he revamped most of those characters in the late 1950's to create what we call the Silver Age of comics.  A list of Fox's literary successors includes comics writers Cary Bates, Mark Waid, and Grant Morrison.<br />Mike Sekowsky's artwork is perfectly suited to represent the various alien worlds and super-science characters that recur throughout the stories, even if his superheroes usually look a little off (except Wonder Woman).	2002-04-01
US	52822894	RBABM53679CE9	0521311012	696162246	A History of Greek Philosophy: Volume 4, Plato: The Man and his Dialogues: Earlier Period (Plato - The Man & His Dialogues - Earlier Period)	Books	4	15	20	N	N	Readable study of 1/2 the Platonic dialogs	Guthrie covers all of the earlier Platonic dialogues in this volume, up to and including THE REPUBLIC.  The next volume in the series (THE LATER PLATO AND THE ACADEMY) covers the rest.  Each chapter covers one or two dialogues.  Guthrie mentions work published by previous philosophers, and indicates where he agrees and disagrees.  The book has a particular emphasis on the development of Plato's theory of the Forms and the influence of the Pythagoreans and Parmenides on Plato's thought.  It's very reader-friendly yet packed with information.  I can recommend both volumes to casual Plato fans.	2002-01-11
