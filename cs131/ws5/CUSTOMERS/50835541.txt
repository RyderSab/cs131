George Patton, the Confederates have swarmed into the United States, storming across the Ohio River, into Ohio, effectively cutting the United States in half. Gen. Abner Dowling is unable to stem the Confederate tide, and is recalled to Washington in disgrace to face hearings. Meanwhile, the Mormons once again revolt in Utah, and terrorism looms in Canada. <br /> <br />By now, we know most of the faces in this drama, though a few drop out, including the surprising choice to kill off Anne Colleton, one of the more interesting characters in the story. <br /> <br />The action is good, there's sufficient human elements to the story, and the overall stragety is thought out well enough. The biggest downer though is that it's too much of a recast of World War Two, with a Hitler-analogy and all that came with it. <br /> <br />Still, it's worth the read, and I just got my copy of Drive to the East today.	2005-09-14

It was a \\"far-out\\" concept that played off masterfully because of his realistic plot development and attention to historical detail.  <br /> <br />I wasn't as enthusiatic about the Colonization series, though it gave some tantalizing details about the Race's continuing struggle with humanity on a half-conqueored world. <br /> <br />Well, I must say I'm glad that \\"Homeward Bound\\" is apparently a single book, and the conclusion to the story of Earth's unexpected contact with an alien species. <br /> <br />There really wasn't much I was expecting about of this book, expect for being really curious as to what the other two client species of the Race looked like. We already knew Home was a hot, dry world, so there wasn't much there. We knew the Emperor was a divine figure, although I thought his body paint would be fancier. So, I basically read to see how the Lizards would take to seeing a human ship in their skies. As expected, they aren't too pleased. <br /> <br />Yeah, there are some dangling threads, but I'm hoping they'll be left to my imagination. I don't want to see what happens when the Russians or the Nazis make their own FTL ships, but I find it somewhat difficult to believe that either the Communist or Nazi regimes could have survived for as long as Turtledove indicated they did. <br /> <br />I just picked up \\"Return Engagement\\" today. I still need the Turtledove fix.	2005-06-25

The only thing that grabbed my attention was that it was co-authored by Vox Day, whose columns I enjoy reading over at WorldNetDaily.  <br /> <br />In the 21st moon, the Moon is colonized and produces much of the food needed for the world. The world is now governed by the United Nations, which is, well, the UN. After years of mismanagement and heavy-handed administration, the colonies revolt against the New World Order and declare themselves a free state. And then the fight begins. <br /> <br />Along the way you meet Dalton Starkiller, a techno gaming geek who volunteers for the lunar militia in a moment of patriotism. Dalton soons discovers war is no video game. And there are more discoveries to be made by all parties involved. <br /> <br />The writing is uneven throughout the book. The description of lunar combat is well-thought and creative, the historical observations are also interesting and the descriptions of national tendencies are amusing. And in keeping with the theme of global bureaucracy, get ready for LOTS of three-letter phrases all through the book. Might want to make your own little glossary.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, many of the characters only seem to be stereotypes of so many other sci-fi types. Other aspects of technology and culture are ignored, and the ending, well, what is it? The end, or the beginning of an unpublished sequel? You can't tell. <br /> <br />	2005-01-19

King Mezentio is shot down at the request of one of his fighters. In the far west, Gyongvar has been obliterated by a magical weapon of mass destruction. Unkerlant has taken Forthweg and installed its own puppet king. <br /> <br />As the war winds down, characters are also trying to pick up the pieces of their lives. Some of them have happy endings, others do not. Garivald finds himself in a mercury mine with Oraste and Ceorl after leaving the war. Bembo loses his girlfriend. Pekka and Fearno get married. Ealstan comes home to his family. <br /> <br />Readers will wonder what happens next in the fantasy world. Will Kuusamo and Unkerlant face down in a Cold War of their own? Will Algarve return to power, or will the Kaunian people ever be free? <br /> <br />History buffs and fantasy fans alike will enjoy the saga. It remains to be seen if Turtledove will revive it for the next generation, like the Return Engagement or Colonization series.	2004-11-08

In the east, Algarve is on the run from Valmeria (France) and Jelgava (Greece). Under pressure from Unkerlant, Yanina (Italy) breaks its alliance with Algarve and declares war on its former partner. In the north, Zuwayza surrenders to Unkerlant, and in the south, the Lagoans and Kuusanans begin to use their new magical weapons. <br /> <br />With all of Turtledove's stories, the individual characters are as appealing as the whole story. Ealstan manages to secret away his Vanai from the Kaunian quarter where she was captured at the end of the last story. Istvan and his comrades are captured by the Kuusanans. Pekka and Fearno are engaged in an affair during their research, and Pekka's husband Leino, who now comes out as a viewpoint character, has martial troubles as his own. Bembo is still fat and taking bribes. Krasta gets knocked up, but by who?  <br /> <br />The series is slowing down, but you still want to read the conclusion.	2004-10-29

Harry Turtledove's fantasy adaptation of World War II reaches a pinnacle with Rulers of the Darkness. As two massive forces collide, fallout from the chaos affects everyone involved. <br /> <br />Algarve (Germany) fails at its third attempt against Unkerlant (Russia), and stubbornly refuses to give up what it gained. But its influence is slowly slipping, as they are pushed from the Duchy of Grelz, an allegorical Ukraine. And with the aid of a new secret weapon, the Lagoan/ Kuusamon (British/ American) alliance throws Algarve from the island nation of Sibiu (Denmark.) Meanwhile in Forthweg (Poland), more trouble is brewing for Algarve. <br /> <br />Ealstan discovers a secret about his new boss, Istvan is struggling to keep his own. Sidroc discovers he likes soldering, as long as he's winning and there's plenty to rape and pillage. Talsu is released from prison to play a dangerous cloak and dagger game. <br /> <br />The characters make the story more interesting than the action. I feel strongly for Vanai and Ealstan, I respect Hajjaj, great pity for Cornelu, and watch with interest in what Pekka and Fearno are up to. I want to watch Krasta to see what stupid thing she'll do next. I am a little bored with Garivald and Skranu though. <br /> <br />Was it my imagination, or is Turtledove letting up on his reduntant character descriptions? If so, that's good!  <br /> <br />The story is still going strong. Looking forward to reading Jaws of Darkness.	2004-10-21

Even continuing to use the life energy of murdered Kaunians, the Unkerlanters aren't breaking, and instead follow suit by murdering their own people. A desparate war is being raged in the streets of Sulingen, including a deadly feud between two snipers. Meanwhile, scholars of Lagoas and Kuusamo struggle to unlock a magical secret that can shift the course of the war. <br /> <br />Turtledove's engrossing characters also struggle with their lives. In Forthweg, Kaunian girl Vanai discovers a spell that gives her and other Kaunians a new shot at life. In the north of Zuwayza, King Shazli begins to admit Kaunian refugees, while in the south of Valmiera, Krasta cuddles up to her Algarvian lover while her brother fights against them in the underground resistance.  <br /> <br />While any Turtledove fan can forgive the reduntant character descriptions and phrases, they will always enjoy the tale.	2004-10-17

Yeats' poem is more dramatic, the previous line is more appropriate as a title. Indeed, in Turtledove's alternate 1930s, things are falling apart. <br /> <br />The Confederate States soon loses its reprieve from inflation in time to suffer natural disasters and the weight of the Great Depression. And Jake Featherston is ready to reap the despair with his demogogery. <br /> <br />Up north, Canadians are continuing a struggle against the United States occupation. The United States, meanwhile, struggles to maintain supremacy against the Confederates and Canadians, and suddenly, the Japanese. <br /> <br />Turtledove continues to weave a tapestry of event of people caught up in a world they can't control.

War is ready to begin.    The United States, weakened by Socialism, is ill-prepared but beginning to catch up on its military. The Confederates, who have descended into fascism, are gearing up for a major push. Meanwhile, they are also beginning an extermination of the black population.    Turtledove is doing a little elimination of his characters as well. Older characters pass on, with new ones taking over. Man-hater Nellie dies from blood poisoning; her nephew Armstrong takes up her line, with his perspective.     Another interesting glimpse into the world is the appearance of more real-life people. There were various \\"guest appearances\\" by certain individuals, like Louie Armstrong, Barry Goldwater, and Ronald Reagan.    Of course, being Turtledove, he can't get away from the repeated character descriptions. Still, this is an outstanding look at what it to come.	2004-10-07

As its sorcerors unleash magical attacks fueled by the life energies of murdered Kaunians, Unkerlant responds by slaughtering its own peasantry. Meanwhile, citizens are feeling the increasing pressures in the occupied lands like Sibiu, Valermia, and Forthweg. The citizens are struggling to go on with their lives under martial rule. <br />The stories of characters caught in situations beyond their control continues as well, some for the better, others for the worse. Kaunian giel Vania, forced to give herself to an Algarivan officer, leaves her ungrateful grandfather for her new lover. Battle mage Cornelu finds his wife literally sleeping with the enemy and escapes back to the high seas. Fearno assists troops on the southern wastelands. And Istvan finds his troops in an endless forest.<br />While a few of the stories get a little vague at times, the novel holds all of Turtledove's strong points. His strengths, the ability to weave a world we can enjoy. The worst, another Turtledove hallmark, is the redundant character descriptions as phrases. If readers don't know Bembo is fat and Kun wears glasses and has a scraggy beard, we won't ever.<br />Still, fantasy and history buffs alike will love this story, and eager for its conclusion.	2004-07-18

But it doesn't complete the beginning story.<br />We see the continuing story that begins in the years before Dune.  The Atreides family, rocked with tragedy, begins a desperate plan to retake the planet of Ix, while Jessica is pregnant with a forbidden son, Paul. The Harkonnens still seethe and stew their evil plots from Geidi Prime. And most of all, the decadent emperor Shaddam IV, greedy for more power, is close to unleashing his secret amal on the universe, regardless of the consequences.<br />The writing style and depth have improved considerably from the beginning in House Atreides. The vivid details make it easy to imagine the majesty of Kaitain, the desolation of Dune, and the depravity of Geidi Prime. Herbert and Anderson also show more confidence in developing intricate plots and subplots. And still, they manage a little humor, like the Baron's etiquette lessons.<br />But, like other reviewers have pointed out, the prequel isn't finished yet. There needs to be a fourth book, to seal the gap, the empty 15 years between House Corrino and Dune. I know Herbert and Anderson are up to the task.	2004-01-12

I have to be objective about my subjective opinion. <br />I think this is a pretty well-written book, filled with strong details about the environment, setting, and emotions of the characters throughout the story. The backdrop gives a strong tone and mood of the novel. While I do think the writing is a little too detached, you still get a good look at the character's inner motives and drives. They all seem like small-town folks, but you know they're deep, complex beings.<br />In all honesty, though, my biggest problem with the book is the genre and inspiration. It's got the Southern tragedy of Faulkner all over it, and I personally detest Faulkner and the vague, detached, stream of consciousness writing.<br />Now here's what I did enjoy: the nostaglia of my time in Aburrido  Verde, at South Central Kentucky University, where I ate many a meal in the SWAN and the Garnet Cafeteria, and was a troll for the &quot;Hark.&quot; (I would have liked a reference to the &quot;Hark&quot; hacks! LOL!) I was in AV the day of the major hailstorm at the beginning of the book. I didn't have any connection to the ASG, and only once or twice went to Z-Mart, that I recall, though.<br />I will respond to other reviewers. I did catch elements of an anti-war nature, but didn't interpret anything overtly political about it.<br />Finally, I think Mr. St. James has a lot of promise for future novels, though I suggest he adapt a new style, and not be so depressing. Again, that's a personal bias. It's great to see someone stepping up and writing about southern Kentucky, where there's a dearth of literature, but an abundence of ideas.	2003-10-13

A lot of the lessons Robert Kiyosaki offers you've probably already heard somewhere else. Things like &quot;make your money work for you,&quot; &quot;pay yourself first,&quot; etc.<br />What can exactly does that mean though?<br />Simply put, Kiyosaki offers a simple new way to look at money. It's more important for most people to unplug their current thinking of money. Instead of thinking, &quot;I'll never be rich,&quot; and then turn on something stupid like &quot;Friends,&quot; and then wonder why they don't have money, a financially smart person will learn more about money. Learn how to manage and control your money. <br />Still, I find a few things a little worrisome. It's clear that Kiyosaki believes real estate is the best solution to wealth-building, and it can be, but first learn what you're doing. Also, I find the philosophy of &quot;greed is good,&quot; and &quot;paying yourself,&quot; even when other obiligations are more pressing, is a dangerous system. Greed is more often than not a destructive force.	2003-10-05

Meanwhile, a weakling mage discovers a powerful artifact, the Crystal Shard, and slowly begins to develop his army, enough to make him the tyrant of the Ten Towns.<br />As Akar Kessel's army grows, Bruenor trains Wulfgar, a barbarian youth he took captive, to be a noble man of both brains and brawn. <br />The many forces meet again, in a titanic clash to determine the fate of the Ten Towns.<br />The characters develop well, and mesh their conflicting personalities and traits with each other.

Initially, the large number of viewpoint characters is distracting and confusing, but the readers quickly adapt.<br />Some of the problems with the book are its parallels with what happened in the real world, and the reader tries to visualize what happens next. This is clear with the Algarvian/ German, Forthweg/ Poland, Underkant/ Russia analogies. However, you get no idea why the Kaunians are so hated, or the history of the world.<br />Also, some of the characters too closely resemble characters of other books.

Nothing against him, I'm just not interested in the genre he typically writes in. I've not really seen any of the movies based on his books, except for the first half of Carrie, (the old one), the whole Carrie, made for TV version, the last part of misery, and Rose Red.<br />But I was eager to get a book on writing written by one of the most famous writers of our time.<br />King's writing is simple, straight-forward, and just plain blunt.    He cuts to the quick, but makes it easy to understand why some people, no matter how hard they try, will never be great writers, but a few can be good. <br />Even more, he illustrates from his own life how writing is, and how it comes to be, and how it can affect one's life.<br />Finally, King was right to pay tribute to Elements of Style, by Strunk and White, the essential tool for all writers.	2003-02-19

It hits the trifecta of excellent research, modern relevence, and an exciting read. While the authors tend to be a bit skeptical of divine influence, they still illustrate how the Bible remains a truthful historical account. <br />The authors take the reader on a detailed look of the history of the ancient Israelites from the days following the Exodus to the gripping accounts of the war of the Maccabees. They regularly use not only the Bible, but extra historical accounts to make their case in detail. It becomes all the more interesting when they demonstrate how other armies used similar tactics in the same area, be they Israelites, Arabs, Crusaders, Turks, or the British. <br />Again, I highly recommend this book for wishing to learn a more complete picture of the wonderful book, the Bible.	2003-01-12

The heartaching sequel to the pre-Dune series continues with House Harkonnen. <br />I'm not calling it heartbreaking because the book it bad, quite the opposite. No, it's heartbreaking because we get an intimate look at the black souls and vileness that is the Harkonnens. At times the depravity and evil of the House of Giedi Prime seems excessive. Dune readers already know the Harkonnens are corrupt, but Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson let it pile on. At times, they seem to be trying to make the Nazis, Communists, and the Taliban seem nice by comparsion.<br />We're now introduced to some more of Dune's characters, namely Gurney Halleck and Dr. Yueh. Two interesting characters with vastly different backgrounds. One thing that bothers me, Gurney should have instantly recognized Dr. Kynes in Dune if they were in the smuggler's camp together.<br />The writing is improving, with more details of the House and Universe arising.

The only real value of this book is its demonstration of what you get when an ignorant Bible student and an undereducated Art Bell fan try to write a book. <br />This is a large collection of faulty research, misuse of the Strong's Concordance, and mystical hooey. His own arguments are contradictory and often trivial.<br />By placing more importance of items like the Shroud of Turin, and misreading its importance, he makes \\"Yeshua\\" trivial. <br />Another point, one of his characters repeatedly states, if it's not in red, it's not necessary, and he castigates Paul for \\"inventing Christanity.\\" But then he quotes the Pauline Epistles.  He makes a big deal about the Strong's Corcordance and King James Bible not having demons in it, which is true, and concludes there's no Devil. Unfortunately, the King James does use the word devil, and Satan.<br />On top of all the bad arguments the book makes, the book itself is horribly written. About 95 percent of the text is dialogue, making it confusing to follow. It never compeling, and full of invisible character devices, and crude references.<br />Finally, I was deeply offended at the vague generalizations he made about the \\"racism\\" and \\"materialism\\" of Christanity. Because some people throughout history waved the cross and committed atrocities, it doesn't make a religion the cause of it. That's gone on since the beginning of time. The same thing for the materialistic nature of Christanity. Many, many religions have been exploited for wealth, but I'd say Christanity has given more to aid the poor far more than any other religion ever has. Could it do more? Of course. <br />I will applaude the author for at least trying to research the Scriptures, something many people grossly lack, including myself. But a wise man once said, \\"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.\\" This book is proof in point.	2002-12-31

While Lords of Chaos portrays itself as a book of the underground satanic metal world, this is essentially the story of the scene most (in)famous individual, Varg Vikernes. That's not the fault of the authors, as Varg is the epitome of the black metal world. <br />The book begins with a detailed evolution of black metal, stemming not only from music, but the culture and history of Norway. Finally, through newspaper and media accounts, and thorough interviews, the reader sees the baleful relationship of the largest players of black metal, especially Mayhem members, and the violent end of Euronymous.<br />A small irony of black metal is that spawned in Norway. Norway is excellent for its majestic scenery and mysterious forests. But for a culture of extreme music, it's more interesting, because Norway is not a violent, strife-filled country. Rather, it's a country with one of the highest standards of living in the world.<br />If you want to see how far a bright and intelligent individual can descend, this is it.	2002-09-17

This is one of those books that likes to yank your innards. First, there's the physical torment reading about emergency surgery in the Third World, or what it's like to get half your leg blown off, or to feel a mustard gas attack coming.<br />Then they're the appalling view on how inept some of our best internal security agents can be. Just reading the accounts of the failures of the FBI and CIA sure do make me sleep easy at night. <br />The writing style is very simple, and a handful of typos slipped through, but it reads quickly and easily. Collins isn't a professional writer, and thankfully, he doesn't pretend to be one. However, he made a good technique of waiting until the middle of the book to describe how he became a Muslim.<br />The author is definitely quite a character, and is somewhat disturbing at times. Often, he seems to dance a razor's edge between working for the freedom fighters and the terrorists. He also seems to have focused himself only on the fighting aspects of Islam, and admits he doesn't know much yet of the Koran. Also, if he's other there to fight and die for Islam, why is he bothering to marry and have a child with another woman, when he's already married in America, and did it not occur to him how is he going to break it to his American wife? And how did he think after 9/11 he was just going to waltz back into Afghanistan? <br />You can admire men who stand for their beliefs, but at times when I read the book, I'm not sure Mr. Collins knows what his beliefs are.	2002-09-11

They have also taken over the entire nation of Canada, creating a puppet nation of Quebec.<br />While the USA celebrates and adjusts to a peacetime economy, the CSA suffers from political strife and hyperinflation. Eventually, USA President Teddy Roosevelt is cast aside for the Socialist Upton Sinclair, who stifles military development.<br />The many diverse characters add interesting flavor to the story, but the biggest drawback is the too obvious comparsion between the southern demagogue Jake Featherston and Hitler. But this begs a question. Where is Hitler? Would be have become the great dictator if the Germans won the Great War? They also said Russia was in revolution, so how does that affect the Socialists in the USA?<br />Mr. Turtledove is still a master storyteller, and I'm eager to read the next chapter of the saga.	2002-08-10

Strange.<br />Looking at the cover, and reading the title, I got the impression this was a book about a wanderer who came to hang out at a gas station, a quiet, calm man who was also a great brawler, held with strong moral codes and beliefs, somewhat like Cain on the old \\"Kung Fu\\" TV show.<br />Instead, \\"Socretes\\" is an old gas station attendant with seemingly magical powers and unique worldview, who inspires the author in his own spirtual quest.<br />I can't claim this book has really \\"changed my life,\\" but it has made me think. Among the lessons I've learned by reading this book are: There are no ordinary moments, eat properly, live NOW and HERE, enjoy what you have, and take full responsibility for your actions.	2002-06-16

They seek to escape the Tripods, giant machines who control the human race through mind controlling Caps.

Fortunately, Harry Turtledove's alternate world gives it a major boost.<br />The American Revolution never happened, and without the American Revolution, the French and Russian Revolutions never happen either, so geopolitics are locked in a three-way dance between the British Empire, the Bourbon Franco-Spanish Holy Alliance, and Tsarist Russia. These powers control most of the world, while the lesser powers, Portugal, Denmark, Japan, and Switzerland control the rest. Germany and Italian are nothing more than a loose collection of regional authorities.<br />One of the crown jewels of the British Empire is the NAU, North American Union, the provinces that would have been much of the United States and Canada. And here, the story begins.<br />The story is so sterotypical it's not even funny. The protagonist is a hard drinking divorcee, bitter with his life, but dedicated to his job. His partner, friend, and foil is an older black man. He is the hero's moral voice, he's a family man, passed over partially because of his race, but he has the strength and character his partner lacks. The love interest is beautiful and brillant, with a troubled background and strange connection to the case. The villians are a group of radical racist political dissents. The rest of the cast is paint by numbers.<br />Yes, the plot's a carbon copy, but the setting vitalizes it. British controlled America is less advanced and more polite than the reality. <br />Turtledove does a good job as usual in adapting the story, but the story itself fails with some points. Because of its unoriginal storyline, the rest of the story suffacates.	2002-04-25

Ed Parker is one of the true American patriots in the nation, tirelessly fighting America's enemies, both foreign and domestic.<br />Mr. Parker was a farm boy from North Carolina when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Immediately after completing high school, he joined the Navy and trained for a naval avitator. Although younger and less educated than most of the other cadets, he developed a quick instict for flying.<br />During the war, he was assigned to the USS Princeton, and spent most of his time in engaged in the tedious, but vital job of recon patrols. He did, however, manage to get combat action against the Japanese, including a daring skip bombing run where he bounced a 500-pound bomb into a Japanese entrenchment, enabling the Marines to advance on the island.<br />Unfortunately for the book, Mr. Parker wasn't able to utilize many of his records, because his ship was sunk by the Japanese, essentially ending his tour in the Pacific. Without his records, he lacks details of his missions, but he does provide many other details, such as maps and schematics, from extensive research into the Navy archives.<br />Mr. Parker doesn't detail much daily activity while in the Navy, aside from playing bridge, and reading intelligence reports. It is interesting to note his opinion on the atomic bomb and its role in the war.<br />This book will be enjoyed by anyone wishing to learn more about the unknown officer in World War Two, one of the \\"Greatest Generation.\\"	2002-04-06

While the Rock may be one of the greatest wrestlers in the game today, he's neither a great writer or storyteller.<br />The Rock Says ... follows closely on the heels of Mick Foley's successful autobiography, and apparently he believed because Foley wrote a great book, he could too. Too bad, but he was wrong, and ghostwriter Joe Layden didn't help any either.<br />The most annoying blemish of the book is the character shifts. All of a sudden, the voice goes from being plain ol' Dwayne Johnson to THE ROCK, which is unfortunate. Mr. Johnson is often more interesting than THE ROCK. When writing as THE ROCK, he repeats many of the catchphrases WWF fans have heard for years, and while they're exciting to listen to, they're tiring to read.<br />Another flaw of the book is just its timing. THE ROCK is at the height of his career, and he's got a lot more to come, much unlike Foley, whose wrestling career was beginning to wind down. So why write your memoir when you've got so much yet to accomplish?<br />The book isn't a loser, though. The reader has a good look and understanding of Mr. Johnson's personal and professional history, and his heritage, which probably plays a larger part in his career than most realize. Under the shadow of THE ROCK, most fans have forgotten he is the WWF's first third-generation champion and superstar. It was also interesting read about his daily routines and a few of his personal beliefs, something Foley neglected in his first book.<br />The Rock Says ... is also a story of dedication and success. Mr. Johnson arose from his status as a mediocre student and washed-up football player to becoming a near-overnight success.<br />I would recommend this book to any wrestling fan, especially aspiring wrestlers, just to show them success can be had, but it can be a long and miserable road to get there.	2002-04-06

The first part is almost a straight action story, and while interesting, it didn't do much to grab the reader's attention.<br />Deception's Web tones down the action and ignites the intrigue. As Lt. Sorenson's party returns to Chi-Town, they are met with court martial and deceit. A traitor is in their mists, and Sorenson's life hangs in the balance. Strange alliances begin to unravel the deception, but there's more to come.<br />The characters are also given a greater chance to develop, allowing for the strange friendship between Van and Darren to come to life, the tensions between other party members, and of course, Kramer, er, Kro-Mar, for the great comic relief.	2002-03-29

For one, Mr. DiBiase wrote it himself. DiBiase doesn't pretend to be a writer, so he produces a simple, straightforward account of his life and career.<br />In reallity, this isn't a book about wrestling as it is a book about a man's turn to God, a man who happened to be a pro wrestler, and one of wrestling's greatest heels. <br />The books's major flaw is that it's too short, and many details could have been added to supplement the book's story. There are a few factual errors, the one I remember was when he described the Wrestlemania 8 match with he and Mike Rotundo against the Natural  Diasters has a great match.

I have always been a fan of Chyna the wrestler, and found her to be a talented and beautiful performer. Listening and reading unscripted interviews with Ms. Laurer has proved to me she's far more than just a pretty face or big muscles.<br />Unfortunately, this &quot;autobiography&quot; does her no favors. She comes across as a petty, resentful woman, filled with contempt for other people. Yes, she's risen above a tough early start, and still has a lot of justified anger toward her parents and other people who've stepped on her, but she doesn't show how she's transcended it.<br />The book itself is very poorly written, with too much unnecessary profanity and as many tangents as spokes on a bicycle wheel. It's also filled with comparsions and similies that the real Joanie Laurer would never use.<br />I don't like ripping this book too much, because I feel for Ms. Laurer and like Chyna, but it's a bad book, plain and simple.	2002-03-10

Many will complain because it's not as profound or philosophical as Frank Herbert's masterpiece, but I can't hold that against them. The elder Herbert was a genius and DUNE his masterpiece, so anyone would have a difficult job in writing it.<br />Actually, I prefer the lack of deep philosophy in the novel, because it allows the characters to come more to life. The younger Leto and his father, along with the Baron and Shaddam are impressive in this novel as in the original series.<br />I am slightly bothered by the contradictions in the storyline, especially with the inclusion of the no-globe and the sligs, things that were not mentioned until \\"Heretics\\" and I thought the inclusion of the Feng Shui room for Jessica's birth just a cheap trick to cash in on a pop trend.<br />I look forward to reading House Harkonnen and House Corrino.	2002-03-08
