During the committee meeting he discovers that there are disturbing undercurrents and rumors of a tell-all play.  When the author of the play, Abigail Winterton, is found strangled he decides to investigate.  I thought this was a charming novel with a good solid mystery to back it up.  Simon is one of the most original characters to hit the mystery scene.  He is witty, clever and debonair, and oh yes...he is a vampire.  The only unbelievable part of this book was that he met not one but three gorgeous, single available men within days of moving to Snupperton:)	2002-07-22

Trying to discover a blackmailer, murderer and thief take all of Anne and Paul's skill. Colonel Paul de Saint-Martin must also balance his desire for revenge against his need for justice in this complex novel. <br />When I started this novel I was a bit disconcerted. The description on the back cover stated that this was a mystery but the first few chapters had the feel of a thriller. If you hang in there, the mystery evolves, becoming more and more complex as the novel progresses. Bath in the late 18th century is well researched and there are some interesting social issues that  are not often addressed in novels of this time period. The romantic elements felt a bit awkward to me but overall this was an entertaining and engrossing novel. The first title in this series is Mute Witness which received very good reviews.	2002-07-22

Ramses is recruited as a spy by the British and Amelia and Radcliff cannot let their son face danger alone so the whole family gets in on the act.  This is a great story from Ms. Peters from one of the few authors whose work I automatically buy in hardback.  Elizabeth Peters has a PhD in Egyptology and her main character Amelia is based on a combination of several Victorian women explorers/archeologists.   Every time I read one of these books I have to dig up one of the real Amelia's books (Amelia Ann Blanford Edwards) about Egypt to reread. The similarity in writing style and voice is uncanny.

As Anna descends into Luchuguilla, she has to battle a near crippling case of claustrophobia but that is nothing compared to what she learns from Frieda when she gets to her.  Frieda is drifting in and out of consciousness but manages to tell Anna that her accident was really attempted murder.  Now Anna has to battle her fear of the cave and protect Frieda from a possible attack.  This is an intense mystery and the action is close to nonstop.  Nevada Barr always does an excellent job with her sense of place and this is one of her best.  You feel what it is like to rapel sixty to a hundred fifty feet into a pitch dark cave.  I personally won't be doing that but I can share the experience from the safety of my couch (thank goodness).  If you would like to start from the beginning with Anna, try Track Of The Cat.	2002-07-22

When she hurts her arm administering CPR to Ted Guthrie, the most hated man at the golf course, Lee cannot finish the game.  When her lover, California cop Graham Sheldon, joins her at the tournament, they join together to solve the murder.  This was a light, cozy mystery.  What appealed to me was the setting and the characters.  I don't play golf but the setting was fresh and interesting without overwhelming you with golf information and the budding romance between Lee and Graham was nicely done.  The authors are a husband and wife team.  Aaron Elkins has written several fine mysteries and Charlotte is a serious amateur golfer and writer.  The first in the series was A Wicked Slice.	2002-07-22

A really great read	I finally got around to listening to All Over But The Shoutin' by Rick Bragg on audio book and was glad that I did.  This book has made it to the top of my best of... reading list.  This is a wonderful autobiography that focuses on Pulitzer prize winning journalist, Rick Bragg's family. In particular, he talks about his momma who he deeply loves and admires.  Without glossing over the poverty and sadness in his life he tells the story of how his momma held their family together.  Rick has a warm intimate style of writing that makes you feel like his family lives next door.	2002-02-01

The main character, Pilot James Aire, has recently been diagnosed with schizophrenia.  As the schizophrenia takes hold Pilot becomes obsessed with the 20-year-old disappearance of his sister.  He becomes determined to find the truth but is hampered by his brother, Eric, who considers him mentally ill.  Helped by his therapist, Katherine DeQuincy-Joy, they search for the truth.<br />The reader is never sure what is part of Pilot's psychosis and what are genuine memories and the suspense continues until the very end.  This is not a book to recommend to &quot;cozy&quot; readers but is extremely engrossing and I highly recommend it.  The audio version won an Audie award this year.	2002-02-01

This is a beautifully written complex novel with strands that all eventually merge during the climax of the story.  This also contains one of the most believable heroic main characters found in modern literature.<br />I have recommended this book to my friends, relatives and even complete strangers. Outstanding.	2001-08-03

I really like the quilting connection, the quirky characters and the setting.  My big problem is that I don't like the main character.  She is defensive and reacts like a rebelling teenager a good portion of the time.  I also can't figure out why she gets involved in the murders.  In other series I have enjoyed, the main character gets involved because she is pulled into the mystery, a student confides in her, a loved one disappears, etc... However, Benni just seems to be noisy (and not in a charming way).  She doesn't give the police a chance to work with her and the sexual tension between her and the chief of police is creepy, not romantic.	2001-08-02
