A Hilarious Look at Family Life	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A lesson in sanity	This book is a fun filled chatterbox of zany humor about family dynamics. As I was reading Schwartz's comical account of bringing home their first baby from the hospital, I was nodding in agreement as I was laughing out loud.  Being a new grandmother and helping to bring in my first grandchild along with being with the new parents for several weeks, this book sparked tons of memories and a good look into the future.  <br /> <br />The author, in a witty smart style, explains his theory about determining a child's temperament, the quick fix for doll babies, the dilemmas of dressing children and creating new family traditions.  <br /> <br />The author found writing his adventures to be a lesson in retaining his own sanity and better than therapy.  Readers, too, will enjoy that effect.  Would Somebody Please Send Me to My Room is a gratifying side-splitter.  Every parent and soon to be parent should read this book.  <br /> <br />Author's proceeds benefit Make-A-Wish Foundation. <br /> <br />Sherry Russell <br />	2005-08-27

The book continues on to outline and teach you how to make \\"good heart\\" the foundation of all your commitments.  <br />Statements like  \\"awakening good heart is like finding a precious gem in a mound of filth\\" and \\"commitment to free all beings from suffering\\" are simply teasers for the mound of philosophical information to be had by reading this book.  <br />The shared conversations with Rinpoche are unforgettable and chronicles the questions about life and soul proving the more crowded life gets the more insulated people make themselves which leads to a life of boundaries rather than freedoms.  As the book points out the choice is ours. It goes one to explain about karma, being in hell, and the hungry ghost realms.<br />I found particularly interesting the four powers of purification which are support, acknowledgment, taking responsibility, not repeating mistakes and purification.  The intense and direct conversations about karma are awe inspiring and engaging.  As the book states wealth and poverty are a state of mind.  When you finish this book you know that something of importance is at stake - you.  Change of Heart shows you how to live your life with courageous honesty.

She was right on both counts. It was packed with<br />information and ideas and at only 105 pages it was a quick read.<br />The author blends her personal insight with quotes from the interviews she conducted. She pinpoints the differences between men and women and how they deal with grief.<br />Early on she states that your grief is like a bridge that you must cross from what used to be to what now exists. That trip isn't fast or easy, but it must be taken in order to feel<br />like you have regained some control in your life. Her references to the stepping-stones or stumbling blocks, rather than the phases of grief, are easy to visualize. She offers<br />information on stress and how it can affect us emotionally and physically, along with some suggestions for dealing with it.<br />Chapter Eight is her Exercise in Truth. It offers a list of questions to analyze your relationship with the one who died as well as those around you. She also touches on family dynamics and the need to work together on the new reality you face.<br />And the last chapter of Sherry Russell's book offers some Pain Relievers and hope - two things I know we all long for.

The main character, Valerie Martin desires to embrace the unlimited boundaries that come with the promise of knowledge as well as the hunt for love.  Valerie armed with an eagerness to be a teacher, commits to the goal by entering college in her mid 30's.  This proves to be quite a feat filled with enough mayhem to keep this ferociously funny and  deeply human story moving at a brisk pace.  Anyone who blushes easily will fall in love with Valerie from page one!  <br />I loved the true to life characters.  These characters experience some sour lemons of disappointments yet encounter plenty of life's gooey sweetness and of course, the gossipy pleasures.  The kittenish claws, the wacky humor, the joyous times, are all part of the witty seduction of this captivating well-written book.<br />Ms. Barry captures the charming peculiarity of college life with traditional and non- traditional student viewpoints and does it with a playful poke in the ribs.  As Valerie says \\"My braincells were doing pushups double time.\\"    <br />Ms. Barry puckishly makes reference to the book meaning by the character taking note as to how the book received its title.  I won't deluge this unique and interesting tidbit of information.  All I can say, is we all should understand the meaning of BJOYFL.  <br />Ms. Barry is a master of this contemporary humor category.  She is an exceptional energetic storyteller.  Bjoyfl is a literary buoy to a down or bored mood.  You will be hooked right from the beginning with this therapeutic cocktail.  Bjoyfl is fun, witty, kooky, charming, and will magically regenerate you.   <br />Ms. Barry, your talent is impressive and I'm a definite fan.  More please!	2003-08-01

She relays her mother's story commencing with a routine test not requiring a ride to or from the hospital.  During the test, her mother has a stroke.  The hospital makes a call to the family, which ignites an emotional bungie jumping between confusion and fearful concern.  In this incredible book, Kathy brings you full circle starting with the onset of the first stroke to life ending and new life beginning.<br /> Kathy describes with courageous honesty the basic and the complex of the \\"unknowns\\" that plague her and her brother.  She gracefully paints a portrait of a family holding together, learning together, and confronting life changes together.  This book is testament that one moment in time changes our lives forever. <br /> One of my especially liked sentences in this book is when Kathy's brother Ed says to her, \\"Kathy, you're not looking for more information on stokes, what you are looking for is someone with a crystal ball that will tell you what is going to happen\\".   Kathy can't help but still search for someone - anyone that will tell her the hard sterile truth.  Kathy braves observing her sweet mother become a person she didn't know and one who in return didn't know her. Every visit Kathy is not sure what she will see or hear.  Will her mother be herself today or will she be a stranger?   There are high points and very low points yet Kathy retains her sense of humor, her love, and her hunger for knowledge about this situation alive and kicking at all times.  This is why this book is so indispensable.  You learn with her and from her.  Not only about the different types of strokes but also the following consequences such as physical therapy, no resuscitation bracelets, nursing homes, dealing with assets, the government, and of course all of the physical and mental changes.  This information is absolutely a must for every professional dealing with strokes.  I certainly hope people will be able to find this book in every library in every city. <br />Kathy approaches her book with courageous honesty.  I found \\"Your Mother has Suffered a Slight Stroke\\" a loving jewel of clarity into the living with and caring for a loved one who has had a stroke.  <br />Thank you, Kathy, for taking on such a difficult subject with such bravery and candor.<br />Reviewed by  Sherry Russell  GMS<BR>Author of \\"Conquering the Mysteries and Lies of Grief	2002-11-18
