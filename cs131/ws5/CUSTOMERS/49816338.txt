It consists of his previous books \\"Law and Promise\\", \\"Seedtime and Harvest\\", and \\"Resurrection\\". While the writing of Neville retain's their magic, Devorss seems to have printed this book in a rush, with several typos. Some silly things like \\"Imaging Creates Reality\\" rather than the correct term Neville used \\"Imagining Creates Reality\\" (note the title to the first chapter already contains a typo). BUt over the book, there are a few more, maybe not more than 10, some are like \\"f\\" which should have been \\"of\\", etc. (We should bear in mind most reprints of popular books always have typos in them, perhaps there is not anyone to proofread old books.)    The good thing is this new publishing gives the old collection a new type face, which makes it look really good and modern.    Overall if you are not fussy about a few typos, this book is a gem for those looking for spiritual meaning in life. The only thing Neville's books teach is that 'Imagination creates events of our life, and it is the sole cause of events'. The first book in this collection \\"Law and Promise\\" contains real cases one after another of how imagination creates man's wildest fancy.     I myself have benefited from discoveriing Neville, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, applied what he teaches, and I have many experiences in using pure imagination to create things I want in life - a perfect job, a perfect apartment to live in with cheap rent, getting the perfect co-tenants, attracting relationships etc.	2005-09-23

What are you( the reviewer who only gave it 1 star) talking about mood psychology? If you are after a book to tell you about EQ or how you should control your emotions or how to get along well socially, then this book is not the one! This book is not even about psychology studies why and how people are screwed up! All that is really time wasting and achieves nothing. <br /> <br />This book by Neville Goddard tells you how you can shape your experience the way you want it. In fact, he is revealing to us what we already do morning noon and night! But most people are not aware of their thoughts that they are hypnotised by the external world and they feel helpless and scared.  <br /> <br />What I like about Neville's method is that he teaches a method that bypasses all psychoanyalysis or any kind of analysis, for analysis are only to find reasons \\"Why\\" you have not succeeded! Those are actually excuses and traps that if you believe them, will rob you of your goal! Neville even goes one step further by teaching you to bypass the analysis of \\"How\\". My point is, most people do not achieve their goals because they are robbed by their \\"Why\\" and \\"How\\". <br /> <br />This book reveals how we create our own experience, and of course it will reveal to you some spiritual secrets and new understanding, for our whole life IS spiritual!	2005-06-15

And he applies the wisdom on our current day world and situation quite accurately. These days, most women have adopted a masuline side while many men have acquired a more softer feminine side, balancing out the polarity. He talks about cooling and hot energy, all taoist and chinese concepts. Some Western readers may not understand these concepts or believe in them. However these concepts are the basis of nature.  <br /> <br />Deida's interpretation of women and men's needs truly is magnificent. Men and women have been going on without knowing their instinctive needs and desires, getting confused and frustrated. Read this book if you want to understand how to make your woman feel happy with you. if you are a lady, read \\"Its a Guy Thing\\" by Deida. <br />	2005-04-16

It has a simple cover with few words, but the wisdom, truth and insights within is priceless! The wisdom from this book are like from ancient scrolls hideen for centuries! <br /> <br />Neville talks about the power of the human imagination to create, and he goes into a few methods of doing it. There is also a chapter on Thoughts Transmission that is very accurate. He talks about our images of people in our mind are real links to their mind etc.  <br /> <br />His technique is certainly unique and a little different from other New Thought writers who only stressed verbal affirmations. You will learn what Neville did to get himself out of the army in just 9 days and became a free man! No he did not run away, but he was honorably discharged by the colonel who disapproved his discharge application 9 days before!  <br /> <br />Among all New Thought writers, Neville is up there with Ernest Holmes and Thomas Troward. Even the famed Joseph Murphy was a student of Neville! <br />	2005-04-08

What can I say, this book by Frederick Bailes is FABULOUS! When I read about his description of 'parent thought' vs 'master thought', i said to myself \\"Wow! Why hasnt anyone written about this before!\\". Where has this book been, in all these years I was trying to find the correct method to treat my false beliefs! As a hint, there are only 7 False Core Belief that most people have that caused ALL their problems. Defeat those 7 Core False Thoughts, and you can be sure no negative thought can be 'created' by your mind anymore!  <br /> <br />Dr Bailes healed himself of diabetes with New Thought, after reading Thomas Troward's book. <br /> <br />Even if you have read New THought books for years, this book is still a must! It categorises the False Beliefs of race consciousness, and teaches the True Beliefs to neutralize the false ones. Now we have all read in other New Thought books that \\"there is no loss\\" \\"no competition\\" etc, but those concepts by other authors were a little all over the place, don't you agree? They were great and knew what they were, but no one ever put them in categories (to be attacked/healed with Master Thoughts) like Bailes does! <br /> <br />FURTHERMORE, the author seems to be really creative and intelligent in coming up with ingenius visualization techniques (could he have been the first NLP practitioner??). Plus he teaches several verbal affirmations that make it easy for you to belief it, such as \\"Of course it is working even now, whether I can believe it or not\\". <br /> <br />Also recommended is Dr Bailes' Science of Mind Treatment book, which details all the mental visualization tricks he has. This guy is way ahead of his times!	2005-02-20

He talks about how to make demonstrations, the attitude and concepts that a practitioner should have etc. Basically it is a book that teaches one how to use the Science Of Mind method properly. <br /> <br />One great concept from this book is that he says there is only ONE treatment. If people treat or affirm and have not got a result, that means they have not completed the treatment. A treatment then can be seen as whatever it takes (1 short session, 1 long session, or several sessions over a few days) to make a demonstration. It is because the mind may hold a past idea that needs to be neutralized, and depending on how strong the past hypnosis was, and how strong the practitioner's current new thought is, this determines how effective the treatment is. <br />I have learned that at times when i persist with a treatment for say more than 15 minutes, that thought will start to intensify and a feeling of joy and knowing will come to me. It is a feeling of absolute knowing that the demonstration is already done, eventho you may not see it yet. That is what Ernest described as the feeling of certainty one gets. <br /> <br />A must read book for anyone who would like to demonstrate.	2005-01-30

Murphy must be one of the few authors and thinkers out there who knew the deep message about religion, both east and west, and particularly the Christian Bible.    He states that the Bible events contain metaphors and hidden messages about the universe and life, those who can see past the events and understanding the true messages are truly indeed. He for one does not take the events in the bible literally, and his understanding of the contents are truly amazing. In this book, he reveals never before written secrets of the bible.    One example: The Cruxificion is actually an ancient symbol of sacrifice to the Divine, similar to the sacrificing of the lamb(the sign of Aries around March-April when spring comes, also Easter time) of Gods by the pagan, to mark the passing of the sun to the equinox (passing from Winter to spring) where the ancient people rejoice when the sun gives life to the earth again, around March/April(Aries). And Jesus was not the only person that was cruxified in written history. For the Ancient Greeks had the god Horus who was born from his virgin mother Isis. And many other ancient figures in written history sacrificed on the cross, before the story of Jesus.    Whats more, by understanding these deep meanings and secrets, you can understand how we create our own life, and how the power of God is right where we are, around us, and in us. This is the eternal message.	2005-01-28

However as Abraham and other authors such as Ernest Holmes will explain, there is nothing but Spirit! The material(solid) world is a total manifestation of the Spirit(thought energy). And we all come to become human to create with joy. <br /> <br />I think the most important concepts that it delivers (that other authors do not) is that by being happy emotionally, we make our vibrations higher and attract better things. Abraham also discusses about our beliefs, emotional states, thoughts, etc. There are many other techniques in this book that you will find wonderfully simple and useful. <br />	2005-01-22

I bought this book as it was recommended by the famous author Ernest Holmes, who also writes on this topic. In fact, Troward's writings influenced Ernest Holmes and the Science of Mind movement. Holmes was able to put Troward's principles to the test and he was able to cure people of illness by mental treatment or what he calls \\"making a demonstration\\".<br /><br />When I bought this book, I thought the early 1900s language was a little hard to read. But one day I was really bored and I read it, and it actually was very inspiring. His ideas and principles he puts forth about Truth, God, Mind, Love, Light, Peace etc, are truly amazing, and they really makes sense! As you read towards the back of the book, more and more wow principles are put forth by Troward. He suggests that most religious people are talking about the eternal heaven to go after this life. Yet he correctly asserts that heaven is a state of consciousness and conditions where we experience Light, Joy, Peace, Abundance etc in our life now. And since heaven is eternal, that means it is past, present and future and forever. Then it must be already here now - unless we do not know how to access that infitine givingness and love of God. We do not need to delay a heaven of joy, love and abundance like most religious teachers claim. And he goes forth to tell you how you can access that, and explains why it is so. And that is how Ernest Holmes could use these principles and treat people to have perfect health and abundance.<br /><br />Lastly, different from other books which teach about \\"you must think of the things you want, not what you dont want\\". Troward goes one step further and teaches a way where you can only think about good things as REALITY.<br /><br />Get this book!	2004-12-01

He earned his living by writing many football books for kids up to around 1950s. In the meantime, he was using himself as an experiment to research on ESP and power of mind.  <br /> <br />He was not born with any unusual psychic abilities, yet with practice and research, he was able to tune his mind to read people's thoughts. I know a friend who knew Sherman in his later years, and said that Sherman could read people's thoughts, make coincidences happen, and several other ESP abilties. Sherman believed that ESP is something we all have, and that with practice we can use it more often in our life. <br /> <br />This book was written in the 1930s, after Sherman did a pioneering long-distance telepathy experiment with Sir Hubert Wilkins. Wilkins went to the North Pole to search for missing Russian pilots, while Sherman stayed in New York. Sherman will daily receive thoughts about Wilkin's feelings, thoughts and conditions, and write them on paper. The reports were submitted to several testifiers of the experiement so that the reports cannot be changed once submitted. There were no telephones, and when Wilkins returned to USA to show his report and diary, an amazing 80% of Sherman's 'readings' of Wilkins adventure was accurate! This was such big news then that it was published in newspapers in those days. <br /> <br />Sherman has good techniques to help you train your mind to do this. And with practice, it gets easier and better. If you are interested, also get his book \\"You Can Make ESP Work For You\\", which describes his lifetime of adventures with ESP, which saved his life many times. <br /> <br />Also recommended is Ernest Holmes' \\"Science Of Mind\\". It was Sherman who opened up my mind about such powers within our mind, and Ernest Holmes' Science of Mind further strengthens the practice and theories. The difference between Sherman and Holmes is that Sherman believed in minds, while Holmes theory of One Mind which is everywhere at all times(what people call God) really explains how it works.	2004-11-29

What can i say about this book, other than, the techniques and affirmations written by Holmes WORKS! I have been exposed to Holmes' work for a few years, but just for casual reading. Recently, I went deeper than just 'reading for knowledge' to living the knowledge. <br /> <br />I was affirming a perfect job with higher salary, and within 1 month, I got a job in another city, and i got a $15,000 increment in salary! (something that a lot of job agents told me is 'impossible' or 'get real'). WHat happened was, my friend called me out of the blue saying his boss suddenly wanted to hire someone with my capability. I sent in my resume, and got an interview. And the old company was having some business changes and decided to split, and I took that as an opportunity to get out. And i went to another city, and got a job immediately. <br /> <br />I also treat my health very often and see great result. I once had a condition, and it healed when I affirmed before i sleep. The next day i woke up, its like there was no condition.  <br />Holmes' work is thick in wisdom for living. If you are interested, also read books by Thomas Troward. Also get \\"Love and Law\\" & others by Ernest Holmes.	2004-11-21

It conveys the central message that - our lifes are shaped by our thoughts. Also we all have a 'thought atmosphere'. This book teaches various creative ways to neutralize negative thoughts/emotions. Some people are caught by negative thought atmosphere/patterns that they find it hard to free themself from it. This author teaches several techniques (verbal and visual and even using some external procedures) to protect ourself and to neutralize undersirable thought patterns. If you are interested in this, also read books by Ernest Holmes, who also teaches almost the same thing, (yet a little different techniques) to condition our thought atmosphere. If you don't condition your thought atmosphere with positive thoughts, it may be influenced by negative thoughts (or what Holmes calls the race-consciousness). This is a great book that you must have! It is not a shallow book about general positive thinking with tidbits such as \\"you can do it\\" etc, it goes much deeper into the nature of thoughts and emotions.	2004-10-31

Walsh had been talking to the God within, the perfect Spirit within. Did not Jesus say \\"This that I can do, you can do also and greater things?\\" and \\"I have to leave because you think I am doing it\\". What about in Philipians when Paul wrote \\"Have in you the same faith of Jesus, eventhough as a son of God, believed that the Father is in him and him in the Father\\". Was Paul himself a \\"heretic\\"? And did not the Buddha said \\"I was once like you, but now I am awake\\". It is the Spirit, the Christ within that glorifies man. And the Christ is in everyone of us. The Hindus call it \\"Atman\\", the Buddhist call it \\"the Buddha within\\", and Christ means the perfect spirit within. <br />This book is great in wisdom and its message.Since the time of The Medieval Church, the church people had to tell you that the Christ is outside of you, and that Jesus is the only God, because they want you to go to their church! They tell you if you go to another church, it is a sin. If you dont go to Sunday Church, then you dont love Jesus. All this is a manipulation of using guilt on the masses. When you go, they tell you things, and they are in power. The Medieval Church were the richest organisation of those times. Oh they forgot to tell you, Jesus is God, of course, BUT SO ARE YOU!  <br />For those who have an open mind, I urge you to read the books by Ernest Holmes, who being a Christian, had the powers to heal people of disease and negative conditions. He believed that the Christ is in every person, and it is the perfect Spirit within that heals. You will be amazed that there are actually many Christians out there who believe God is in everyone.	2004-10-04

It is not a religious book, but rather a philosophy and psychology and more of a positive thinking New Thought book. It has become my favourite Ernest Holmes book in my collection. If you don't have time to read Science Of Mind, which is a very thick book, then read this first for a concise version where he talks about the principles of Science of Mind in an informal way. Some chapters are taken from his lectures, and I think he expresses his ideas very well in this book. It covers beliefs, attitudes and wisdom that you may have never read from his other more formal books like Science Of Mind, &quot;This Thing Called You&quot; or &quot;Creative Mind and Success&quot;.<br />There is a questions and answers part in each chapter where he answers questions. This is the part which I like the most. He talks about things which he never revealed in other books, more personal issues and how he overcame his own beliefs of poverty etc. Then each chapter ends with him affirming - I learn from this part how he actually takes up an affirmation, how he neutralizes all doubts and fears and opposing thought, and how he makes the affirmation undeniable and undoubtable.<br />The first time I read this book, I followed his method of affirming for my health, and I kept repeating it, and in 10 minutes I can see and feel improvement! I was filled with joy and energy. Then I took up a thought for someone and affirming goodness and happiness into her life, and she calls immediately after that in a joyful voice from another country!

In fact his wisdom and vision is so deep and profound that I would dare to say he is the best. Many authors like Stuard Wilde, Harold Sherman, and others have read his book.<br />Have you ever wondered, how can this man cure illness and  psychosis in people by just concentrating on them (without laying hands)? Even cancers dissapear! I read in another book that Ernest Holmes used to wear thick glasses in the early years, but then as he slowly understood more about the Mind, he healed himself completely by recognizing the Truth by affirming daily that &quot;There is One Spirit which is One Perfect Vision, and this Perfect Vision sees through me&quot;. <br />He is the founder of the Science Of Mind movement that utilizes the wisdom of philosophers and religious texts such as Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism. Indeed, Ernest understands the deep meaning and messages in these text, and he loves all religion, yet he understood that all religion is only a vehicle towards the Truth. Most of all he loves the Truth of Spirit. He believes in no rituals, except the 'ritual' of knowing the power of Spifit. His understanding goes beyond the opposites(yin and yang) of life, and he sees into the Divine Perfection which is within everyone of us. He believes that we are all gods (rememeber Jesus said &quot;do you not know that you are all gods?&quot; and &quot;this thing I do you can do also and greater things&quot;). Truly, in everyone of us, the Christ, the Krisna, the Buddha and God resides, which is the Perfect Spirit.<br />This book contains the teachings and applicable theories and principles taught by Ernest Holmes.It contains many chapters (this is really a thick volume!) on spiritual ideas of health, abundance, perfection etc. Also contains many affirmations. <BR>His affirmations remain one of the best, innovative and most effective.<BR>Use it to tear down all false beliefs and illusions.<br />Readers love him for his faith, love him for his wisdom.

It is simple to read, yet it conveys Ernest Holmes' wisdoms at the core, and directly. <br />Ernest Holmes will tell you about the concept of Divine Mind, Spiritual Supply, Mental Laws, and why our thoughts create our experience. <br />The first time I read his concept of &quot;Entering The Absolute&quot;, it really opened up a new way of thinking for me. He says that to enter the absolute means, be able to think independently of any existing circumstances or problems. Meaning, if you have any problem or situation which you wish to solve or get out from, the only way to get out from it is to spend your focus mainly on what you really want - which is the solution/answer. If you are poor, you have to think thoughts of wealth,abundance and success, to dwell on the &quot;Infinite Supply&quot; and never on the present circumstances. Many other authors have written about true stories where people have gotten themself out of their situation of lack, by daily thinking and feeling about what they truly desire. <br />I recently read that the author Anthony Robbins, many years ago when he was broke, he set such big 'impossible' goals for himself such as owning a huge castle to live in, a limosine, being a multi-millionaire and being the successful person he desired to be. And he mentally rehearsed each goal everyday, as if its already achieved, that within JUST ONE YEAR he achieved all of his goals above! The castle, the limo, the wealth and life he dwelled on everyday!<br />For those who are interested in this topic, you may want to read &quot;As A Man Thinketh&quot; by James Allen.

Few of his very powerful beliefs he lives by that I have used to achieve impossible achievements are &quot;There is ALWAYS a way, If I am committed to find one&quot;, &quot;It is in the moments of your decisions that your destiny is shaped&quot;, &quot;Manage your emotional states and you master your behaviours&quot;.<BR><br />If you read about his story, he was 17 years old, broke and living in his VW car outside 7-11, and he joined Jim Rohn's company to start selling Rohn's educational sets. And he sold to every single person he made a sales appointment with, just by applying what he learned from Jim Rohn and others. Even Jim Rohn couldn't believe it, since nobody in the company could sell more than this 17 year old kid. And when he was broke, he set such goals as owning a castle home, big cars, being successful etc, and in 1 year he achieved them all, just by rehearsing and staying committed to his goals every day. And over the years, he achieved amazing redults just by applying the skills, beliefs, and techniques he learned. He proved to me that, if you are committed to your goals, values, and committed to doing the things you MUST do each day to be at your best,- then you can do seemingly amazing things even with simple techniques and beliefs.<BR><br />This cassette is an additional companion to his book Awaken The Giant Within. Although the publisher produced this tape, which is about 60 - 90 minutes, some of the information and techniques in the book are not included here. But I love this tape as his delivery is very powerful and infectious. Get this tape, I guarantee it will help you, IF you apply them in your life. Don't be like most people who reads good books, and then say it's not good, just because they don't apply what they read. Reading and merely listening won't change your life. Applying it does! The world is filled with educated derelicts- people who know a lot of knowledge, but didn't use what they know.	2004-05-19

The power of these questions is immeasuarable. It will change your life IF you USE it everytime you make a important choice.<BR>The brain is asking questions on a subconscious level all the time - eg. what should i do now?, is this the right action?, where do i go from here? etc.<BR><br />If you study people who are depressed and feel stuck in life, you will invariably find that they use the wrong questions. Questions that make them feel stuck and helpless such as &quot;Why do I always fail?&quot;, &quot;Oh, who do i think i am?&quot;, &quot;why can't i get it right?&quot;, &quot;why does it ALWAYS have to be me?&quot;. The human mind cannot help but give answers to these questions, thereby creating a loop of negativity. <br />BUT if you ask the right questions, it will lead to the right answers which makes you stay on your life purpose. The questions in this book are addressing choices you make. There are also other types of powerful questions not included in this book, questions which opens up new ways of thinking and doing things. I would recommend people who would like to explore the power of questions such books as &quot;Frogs Into Princes&quot; and &quot;Structure of Magic&quot; by Richard Bandler and John Grinder. These books address the importance of asking the right questions that they call the &quot;Meta Model&quot; used in NLP. One of the most powerful questions Bandler and Grinder came up with was &quot;What if I could?&quot; everytime you think something is 'impossible'. This question immediately breaks the limitation and opens up new resources and pathways to achieving. Anthony Robbins reckons that this was the one big question that turned him from a failure to success when he was starting out. <br />And instead of saying &quot;I'm depressed&quot;, ask instead &quot;HOW exactly am i making myself feel depressed?&quot; thereby breaking the illusion that depression is a 'thing' that one has, instead of the result of some processes in our mind, or posture. Read these books to master these powerful questions which will change your life.	2004-04-17

The meta-models and questions in this book can be used daily to break away limiting beliefs and limitations in thinking and possiblity. One secret is that the chapter called &quot;Incantation for Growth and Potential&quot; is the most powerful chapter in this book, as Bandler reveals just a few years ago.<BR><br />Memorise the meta-models, and the questions to break away the Distortion, Deletion and Generalization, and you will be glad you did. One of the most powerful question I learned from this book is, &quot;What IF I could?&quot; whenever I think of a goal, or whenever someone said something is 'impossible' to achieve.

Written decades ago, it records his experience and findings with OBE. This book contains more details about the astral planes nearer to the vibration of the physical plane we live in physically. It does however contain other dimensions and planes which he labels &quot;Locale 2&quot; and &quot;locale 3&quot;.<BR><br />His second book &quot;Far Journey&quot; is still my all time favourites, as it contains a lot of spiritual findings he has about the meaning of human life, etc. Is there reincarnation? Is there a God? Read all of his books and find out. The reason I like Monroe's book is that he use himself as a guinea pig to explore and investigate. He doesnt try to use religion and his beliefs and try to put it on you.<BR><br />Monroe was a business man, and ever since he had the OBE experiences since the age of 42, he has been exploring it to find out more about it. After years of experimentation with soundwaves, he finally came up with his Hemi-Sync audios, which are able to induce OBE and altered states suitable to change habits, addictions, etc. In response to one of the review (below or above) who questions Monroe's sanity, Monroe has been doing many experiments about his OBE with the famous Dr Charles Tart, and Tart wrote the introduction to his book!<BR>OBE is a very subjective experience, it cannot be proven objectively unless you experience it yourself, therefore people who have never experienced it will try to reason and use logic (which is limited only to their own ignorance/knowledge). Their (the psychologist's) reasonings and logic then becomes their belief (which they will try to prove is the only correct one- hmm, isn't that what they say about people's belief system?). <br />I have personally tried Monroe's technique outline in this book, and it works. Try it if you have the courage! It will prove to you once and for all that you are more than your body. (But of course, you may have a hard timeconvincing YOUR psychologist!)	2004-02-17

It was great. I actually followed his method to induce a OBE and one morning I woke up, felt really peaceful, and when I thought I was drifting back to sleep, I actually became conscious of disorientation. It was as if I felt like I was on a rocky boat (my bed felt like a rocky boat), and the rocking increased more and more and I got scared and forcefully sat up to sit up. I guess I wasnt ready to explore this.<br /><br />This second book by Peterson seems a little &quot;miseleading&quot;(?), since the cover says Spiritual Growth etc. In it, all he talks about are some ESP experiences that he noticed in his daily life. I was hoping it will talk about things similar to Robert Monroe's Far Journey, where lessons and the meaning of human existence can be gained.<br /><br />In my opinion, Robert Monroe's &quot;Far Journey&quot; (still my all time favourite) and &quot;Ultimate Journey&quot; seems to be the 2 best books that explores the spiritual learnings side of human existence. Where Peterson explores the more &quot;physical&quot; environment and ESP learnings in daily life, Monroe's books explores more of the environments out of our physical reality - other worlds, other lifeforms and consciousness, astrally created environments, and areas out of our known space/time reality.<br /><br />Get Peterson's first book, it is really good, and also Monroe's 2 other books if you are looking to learn about this subject.	2004-02-16

Change your view.	When you start your working life and start supporting yourself (and family for some), all you can ever think of is money money money - &quot;how do i pay the next bill thats coming?&quot;, &quot;how am i going to pay for the car insurance?&quot;, &quot;will i be able to put my children to a good private school and university?&quot;.<BR><br />This book really changed my view about money. Its not about greed at all, its about a quality of life for yourself and the people you love. I used to think money is not spiritual. Then when I started my working life, I understand how hard my parents must have worked to put me through university in a foreign country. I start to understand how many people have spent their entire life working in a job, just to support the people they love, to give their kids a better life.<BR><br />Being poor and in a condition of lack is not spiritual. The Divine is abundance, not lack. Being in want is not divine. We live in a material world, where everything from the place you live,your health, the advice and time you need from other people, the food and water you eat and drink- all these (except the air you breathe)requires money. When the religious and spiritual people like Mother Teresa, charities, YOUR church, etc want to do their work, they need money. And where do they get it from? - rich people. By having more than enough, you can help yourself, the people you love, and other people as well. It's certainly better than being someone who requires help from charity or the government to support their very existence.<BR><br />This book will show you that spending your life working in a job will get you nowhere. Nobody gets wealthy by living in a job. In fact, many millionaires called J.O.B. as &quot;Just Over Broke&quot; -living from paychecks to paychecks. Kiyosaki tells of a story about 2 men, 1 highly educated with a phd, and another who only had high school education. Yet the phd ended up broke, while the other becomes extremely wealthy.<br />Read this book and learn as much as you can to have abundance, it will change your financial path for the better.	2004-02-12

This is one of the best prayer/positive thinking/affirmation book ever written. FLorence Shinn joins the ranks of famed author such as Norman Vincent Peale, Joseph Murphy, Napoleon Hill, Ernest Holmes and others as great authors in this field of &quot;Thoughts are THings&quot; paradigm.<BR><br />Although I am not a Christian, I did the some of the affirmations and denial affirmations as in the book, and within 1 week I got the opportunities I hoped for! I am also an avid reader of Ernest Holmes and Joseph Murphy.<BR><br />However I do not fully believe in her saying that Tithing is a must, and it is greater than charity. (Of course! She is a Christian Minister!) I have seen many very spiritual and wealthy men who do not tithe (because they are of other reiligions, or no religion), but give generously to charity. I have also seen many religious people tithe all their life and yet always struggling for more money. I am not saying tithing is wrong, but as even she admitted that one who tithes(gives) but do not believe in receiving will not receive anything. Tithe or Charity - it still shows that the attitude of tithing is still based on Belief. All it does is to tell your subconscious mind that there is more than enough money available to you.<BR><br />Florence Shinn and Catherine Ponder seem to be more religious in their writing. Other authors such as Ernest Holmes talks more about the power of faith, affirmations,prayer and the mind, rather than getting too deep into religion.	2004-02-01

And the news release on that website (apparently a website of a radio station in USA) mentioned that the cd cover was released 1 month BEFORE 9/11, and it was pulled back by the record company immediately. I thought, either these people had psychic abilities, or they knew something the public didn't know. <br />2)Also on the day after 9/11, i was walking in my university and a guy in a protest stand was saying that people already warned there will be attack sometime in Sept on USA, but the government apparently did not do anything. <br />3)And then there's this Anthrax scare at the same time that made the whole USA stayed at home.<br />4)And then sometime later someone wrote a complaint ( I received a copy of the complaint through chain mail) that the CNN was broadcasting &quot;false and misleading footage&quot; of middle east people celebrating (CNN claims the footage shows they are celebrating the attack on America), however, someone pointed out with PROOF(!) that the footage was actually taken from 1991! So these 'mastermind' people own the CNN too!<br />5)Remember that even before the 1st tower went down, the news was already showing picture of Bin Laden as the &quot;Prime Suspect at this time&quot;?<BR>How did the government intelligence became so quick and efficient suddenly to come to that conclusion?<br />Hmmm, not too crazy claims after all Mr Icke.

For the critic below/above who said that this book is misleading, (and who claims that Reid encourages people to take drugs and use sex toys etc,)... I would say that his review is the only miselading one since in the book Reid never encourages the use of drugs, instead Reid stresses again and again that according to the ancient Taoist, food is the best \\"medicine\\". Reid doesnt even encourage the use of medicine (as the western doctors will give you eg antibiotics etc) let alone drugs. Reid encourages the use of natural food and fruits for one's diet to cure ailments such as headaches, obesity etc.<br />The best chapters in the book is the book on Breathing and Chi, where he explains what chi is, and how it works to energize the body. The second best chapter will be the one about sexual secrets of the Taoist - particularly for male. Men seems to be the gender that has more disadvantage in sex than females, since men think about sex most of the time, have great drive towards it, yet without knowing the Taoist secrets, men are disillisioned about it since he gets less satisfaction, and is left enervated (fatigue) after sex. Reid explains the ancient Taoist secret to avoid those disadvantages and turn it around.<BR><br />The 3rd best chapter is the one on Food Combination. I have been following it for a few year, and what a difference it makes. After lunch, I see my friends feeling sleepy that they find it hard to stay awake, yet i feel energized.<BR><br />This is a great book, read it with an open mind. It is certainly much better than Dr Atkins or Carbohydrate Addict books which have much negative side effects.	2003-12-06

And we can reclaim our health in a healthy and safe way.<br />For those looking for the 'documentation' and proof of his theories, I can only say one thing - the results of people's health improving and shown in the blood cells under the microscope tells a more solid story. In fact they tell the whole story. It's not theoies that just sounds good to your ears, but does not produce result (or have side effects). Even Dr Neil Solomon from the UN says (about some of Dr Young's theories on cells) &lt;i&gt;&quot; IF I had not seen it with my own eyes (under the microscope), I would say it's scientifically impossible&quot;. &lt;/i&gt;<br />&quot;Theories&quot; are just useful ways of explaining why things are the way they are. Many people can come up with fancy theories, but their theories don't produce results. Look at the Atkins diet for example, great simple theory, and people DO lose weight, but they end up looking haggard and 'dried up' and unhealthy with overworked kidneys, because with that amount of protein they are taking, the body is filled with toxins, acids and they are losing water weight more than anything else.<BR>Dr Young's theory and suggestions enables people to lose weight, reclaim their health, and many have experienced healing from several illnesses.

I started finding out about the disadvantages of drinking pastuerized milk in 1999 from a book called &quot;The Tao of Health, Sex and Longevity&quot; by Daniel Reid (available from Amazon).Reid concluded that milk actually curdles in the stomach and makes other food indigestible, and also pasturization destroys all enzymes and nutrients in it.

It has been concluded now that this is not the case. &lt;b&gt;Milk, is actually bleaching calcium from our bones, not putting calcium into it.&lt;/b&gt; Dr Young says milk contains lactose, which is a sugar in the body, and when sugar is released into the bloodstream, calcium is used by the body from our calcium reserves in our body (eg the bones), to neutralize the acids of the sugar. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;Dr Young does real live blood analysis, and he says if you look at your red blood cells after drinnking milk, you wont be happy,&lt;/i&gt; as it makes the red blood cells stick together and fill them with bacteria and toxins.

Western science and research has documented and researched these theories with Kirilian photographs and other energy detection machines, and the acupuncture points and meridians are now widely accepted as existing. Western Science also has the same theory, that the body is made up of electromagnetic field with positive and negative charges, which is similar to what the ancient chinese theorized. <BR>Many times people claim that when their chiropractor touches a specific point, a memory comes to their mind, and they are able to release it. The ancient chinese say, emotion, thought and energy are interlinked. Therefore any emotional blockages can cause energy to be blocked in specific meridians. Work with the energy, and you work with the emotion as well, it is a feedback loop. <BR>This book is a great manual! It contains all the different points and ways to tap for each negative feeling. It discusses all the emotions in detail, and how we go about releasing them. Although this method is great and it works, users should also take care of their health through diet, as physiology and energy level affects the quality of emotion and thought we have.

For the person just reading the reviews to Robbin's book just to click \\"No its not helpful\\", I sugest you get a life and start thinking of what you really want in life and taking actions to achieve it, instead of spending your time going against Robbins just because you don't understand what he is writing about (or you didn't apply it after reading it). Give up the narrow mindedness and start to open your mind and start taking action towards the life you want. Just because someone is happy, successful, rich, doesn't necessary mean he is doing it by unscrupulous ways. Robbins truly is out there making a difference in people's life. If he couldn't touch your life because you were closed off, then whose fault is it? Have you ever asked yourself, \\"If others can change their life for the better with his books, then why can't I? Or why didn't I even try to apply it as a test?\\"     As a philosopher once said, \\"If you choose to be poor because you think its spiritual, thats fine. But if at the same time you despise or envy those who are rich, then that is called a hypocrite.\\"   The more you envy and despise other people's success and wealth, the more you are sabotaging your own growth. And who in this world is not selling hope? Think about the religions, the makeup companies like Revlon, the schools, the architects, the teachers, the entreprenuers- all these people and institutions are selling  FEELING and HOPE AND IMPROVEMENT for those who want to improve their life in some way!    For the reviewer who said Tony is not original, let me ask you this- does it necessarily take an original splendid and complex idea to change your life? Do you want a new sophisticated ideas just to make yourself feel so sophisticated and intelligent or do you want to change your life? Isn't changing your life with simple ideas that works more intelligent than trying to fill your brain with so much philosophies but doesn't change a thing?    Tony is not really reknowned for his ability to come up with new ideas. Even the people whom he learned those ideas from were trying to emulate some other geniuses. In fact, one of his core ideas is to 'model' the best people in any selected field and master their beliefs and consistantly apply it. He is more known for his commitment to be the best, his ability to apply ideas intelligently in different contexts etc.      This is a really exciting book to read. How could a young man with little education, no money, washing his dishes in his bathtub, low income , became a millionaire in 1 year? The answer and knowledge is all in this book. Written in 1986, it was a bestseller among entreprenuers and business people. This book teaches you how successful people think. Tony was a total failure, until one day he went to a NeuroLinguistic Programming (NLP) seminar by the genius Dr Richard Bandler and John Grinder.    NLP is a new field of science/psychology that can radically and quickly change human behaviour and thinking in very short time. With techniques and beliefs modelled from America's genius hypnotherapist Dr Milton Erickson, and family therapist Virginia Satir, Richard Bandler and John Grinder was able to cure phobias, anxieties, depression, etc within minutes (where traditional Freudian Therapy took up to 4 years without results).     IN a nutshell, NLP is to find out specifically how somebody who is good at something do that thing, (studying his beliefs, and subjectivity), and then model that to apply it to yourself or others to produce the same (or better) results. It is called the Modelling of Mastery.     Tony mastered NLP within a short time frame, and he used NLP to change his thinking,beliefs,behaviour in a massive way that turned him into a success. Tony is one of the few people Richard Bandler (the NLP co-founder) gives a lisence to teach NLP, and if you know Richard, he trusts very few people!     The first time i came across NLP, i thought, \\"oh yeah, right, another of these quick way to happiness and success\\", without really understanding it. Then slowly i learned more about NLP, and i applied some of the NLP techniques on myself, and I was so shocked it WORKED! I used the NLP method to cure my nail biting habit, instantly! Then i used it to cure my shyness. Then i used it to propel myself to success. Bandler and Grinder's mastery is in how the Brain and nervous system works. They are not theorists, (unlike most psychologists). They only do what works.     When Bandler and Grinder first came out with the NLP model in the late 70s, everyone said they were making false claims. Yet one by one Bandler proved to them that NLP really works, where traditional psychology doesnt. HIs favourite saying is \\"If the old way of doing things doesnt work (or is producing mediocre results), do something else... do something new!\\" I recommend people to read other books by Richard Bandler, especially \\"Frogs Into Princes\\" and \\"Magic In Action\\" (this book is from the famous seminar where Bandler proves the cynics wrong and cures phobics and patients (on stage, live!) within 30 minutes,(no preparation before hand)as an experiment' conducted by one of the Universities who wanted to disprove Bandler)	2003-06-27

I have read Monroe's 3 books, and this one seems to be the most intriguing and enlightening. While his first book talks about the mechanics of Out of Body Experience ( written in the early days when he was still experimenting with it), this book talks about his Far Journeys to the outer realms of existence, out of time and space limitation, where he learns about the cycle and meaning of human existence (this will be the first time you read something like this from a rational straightforward perspective, without any religious conotations). Talks about human existence in time and space, and about existence outside of time and space. He meets a brighlty glowing enlightened being who knows everything about him (somewhat like his guide) who guides and shows him about life itself (most people who had Near Death Experience think that glowing being as their God, or Jesus, Allah, angels or whatever God they believe in, which Monroe many years later in his 3rd book 'Ultimate Journey' discovered who that glowing being truly is! You will be absolutely shocked and surprised!!)<br /><BR>In this book he uses a lot of new terms which he uses to describe the Non-Verbal Communication (NVC)(similar to telepathy) and Ideas he experienced and communicated in the out of body state, into verbal language (English) which we use to make sense of things. Spirits don't use languages like humans do, since language is a human creation!! That is the reason why he used many unusual terms, to generally describe the NVC to the reader. It actually isn't that hard to read, you just have to flick the pages and refer to his word list (only about 15 words) to look up what it means.	2003-06-15

On the left pages are the Challenges or 'problems' people face, and the right page will show you the solution- how to adjust your attitude and mind to respond to such a challenge, and bring results.<br /><br /> it is amazing how such a thin book can be so inspiring. THIS IS NOT A RELIGIOUS BOOK. No rituals, no dogma. Only wisdoms of the ages that works.<BR>Ernest Holmes' philosophy are derived from Christian and Eastern (ancient Hindu, Taoist, etc) thought. His view on religion is wise, a deeply spiritual man. In fact, unlike most religious/wpiritual writers, he is one of the very few authors that can talk about religion and philosophy without any dogma, rituals, nor bias against any other religion/philosophy.	2002-09-15

This books is invaluable, along with the new book by another author called \\"The Bible Fraud\\".<BR><br />The christians keep confronting people on the street and telling people about the bible this and that, and trying to ask u to go their church. And they say anything that is not in the bible (such as reincarnation, karma [which is basically the law of cause and effect, or the bible's \\"sow and you shall reap\\" etc)is just bull and superstition or the \\"devil's\\" work. <BR><br />These people go to church just to be led by the beliefs of the pastors there, as if  the pastor truly knows what the bible means. I once heard a pastor tell about his beliefs about some lines in the bible, and he interpreted it in his way. Then he told EVERYBODY there,\\" i know some of you after this will come to me and tell me your interpretations of those bible lines,, but DON'T even try, because nothing is going to stop me from sticking to my own interpretations and i dont want to change my mind about it\\". And all this guys wants is just a feeling of certainty of his beliefs, and even when the opportunity for another interpretation of truth is available, he is unwilling to take it? And this guy is out there preaching to so many thousands of people??? And those Christians tell me, if i want to know about christinity, speak to their pastors and the \\"people who know\\". But just WHO are the people who know? A pastor must necessarily know the truth about his religion? Isnt it all just personal and collected BELIEFS?? Most people think belief is reality, yet it is only a description of what reality might be. If you can understand this, you will be able to realise that none of us really knows what reality is, or what really really happened.. all we can contruct is a model and a belief.. and some models are more accurate than others..<BR><br /> well, in the new book (written by a christian) called \\"Bible Fraud\\", the author refers to the OLDEST BIBLE IN THE WORLD- the Sinai Bible, the author finds a staggering 14,800 DISCREPENCIES between the Sinai Bible and the NEw Testament!!! (you'll like this - \\"REVISED\\" NEW edition of the New Testament, year 2000 edition? The question that pops into my mind is -revised by WHO? Hey i dont want the revised edition, I want the original bible!) Many things are deleted, such as Jesus's wife, their beliefs on reincarnation[ why do u think Jesus' disciple asked him if the malformed infant \\"sinned before\\"(meaning he existed before this life!) or his parents sinned?] etc... by the middle ages church because in those time the christians have a belief what a god should behave, live, be celibate.. etc or else the church can't collect money and manipulate people. The concept of reincarnation they deleted so they can make people work for the afterlife or they couldn't control people with their Sin and \\"you are all sinners\\" theories! And evidences are also shown in original paintings of the last supper, and of Virgin Mary and her twin childs (Jesus's twin brother!).. i guess people in those times still had access to older bible knowledge.. <BR><br /> these books are really worthwhile to read, and you can start to realise how powerful a distorted story can be taken so literally by millions and millions of people, when delivered by a powerful manipulative source such as the Church. One of the Popes said something to this effect -\\"HOW PROFITABLE IT CAN BE, JUST BY TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT A STORY\\"!	2002-06-09

TOny Robbins knows what makes people excel in what they do. I know, because i just attended his Unleash The Power WIthin seminar. I noticed one of the reviwer here attacked Robbins for his health regimen and claims, but has the reviewer himself tried his diet to see how much healtier and how much more energy that diet gives us? Why say the earth is flat just because it looks and feels flat to you? Every scientific breakthrough in any field is first ridiculed and challenged isn't it? Then it slowly becomes fact. <br />TOny's company has been doing research on health with top scientists to find out whats really happening unbiasedly, they don't just buy into researches from companies who want you to buy their product.  TONY RESEARCHED HIS STUFF AND MAKES SURE IT PRODUCES RESULTS BEFORE HE GIVES EM TO YOU! I know, because when i fisrt read this view on health etc, I thought to myself it isn't true. BUT Robbins does not ask anyone to just simply believe him, he asks us why not try it out for at least 3 days to see the result - how much more clearer, energetic you become. I DID. And when i went back to my old diet, I felt the difference - sluggish, tired, weak. Look at Tony, he's the one who talks on stage for 12 hours a day with so much energy that he doesn't get tired at the end of the day. <br />And when i first heard of the QLink pendant, I didn't believe it. Until TOny's chiropractor gives a demonstration to hundreds of people of the audience/seminar (they volunteered), and prooved that the pendant DOES PROTECT YOUR BODY FROM HARMFUL EMF (electromagnetic frequencies). Its based on Quantum Theory - a scientific theory that even Einstein was skeptical of initially, but has changed the world. Its rocket science. I bought one as i used to get tired from the computer screen and a headache from mobile phones. Now i don't! <br />Look at the Western World, their eating habits made majority of the people of the US overweight, ill with heart disease etc, malnourished (would you believe that a recent researched prooved that more % of people in the US are malnourished with their rich diet, compared to Mexico!!).You see, if you follow what the norm say and do, you end up just like them. Why not model those who have achieved excellent results?	2001-10-25

Read this book couple of years ago... and what i learned from it still guides me in my daily life, and it has reshaped my view about the Universe, about humans, about LIFE itself.. and most of all, myself.   Monroe writes about his exploration in the OBE astral realm, and there are many spiritual lessons he learned. It is recommended that you read his other 2 books Far Journeys and Journeys Out of the Body as well to get the full picture. Time travelling, Space travelling in the astral world is indeed an amazing adventure. 'Far Journeys' and this book are focused on the spiritual learnings that he accummulated on his astral travels. As he states in Far Journey, the first book \\"Journeys Out Of the Body\\" was about the mechanics of the OBE experience, about the methods and his observation of this phenomena. But after a while, he got bored with exploring his immediate physical surrounds (left brain logic), OBE had become a routine. One night, he made the conscious choice to let his unconscious(right brain) take over his options, and he was transported to another phase of his OBE - his exploration out of time-space. Here he learns about his life, makes new spirit friends and learn amazing things from them, travel to the past and future, learn about life as human. An excellent exciting read!	2001-08-10

Therefore anyone who says von Daniken &amp; other authors like his are full of crap are really sold by the norm who thinks that whatever is commonly accepted is the 'truth'. <br />As we move into the new millennium, we human beings desperately need a paradign shift in their thinking. Evidences like those provided by Daniken should be taken seriously, studied and open a new possiblity to our interpretation of the past. Yes, HISTORY IS AN INTERPRETATION OF THE PAST, and we should be more open minded to the evidences presented. <br />Archeologiests and anthropologist take the facts and reconstuct the past from it. They should NOT discard proofs of ancient technology which is more advanced than we think, and turn a blind eye on it. For example, historians have no place for things found from the past (eg. an ancient device later proven to be a simple battery, and the convex lens from ancient times, and a machine like cog that was found under the sea which were dated to ancient times) in their &quot;history of man&quot;, all because they presume that ancient people live in the cave and simply can't produce these things. They can't fit it into their 'dumb cavemen' history so they discard these artifacts. And these artifacts are displayed in museums! What a contradiction!<br /><br />As we move on in time, new discoveries are reported each day, and over the years, we see the date of the 'oldest skeleton found' keep changing and back-dating, as they discover more &amp; more. They used to say it is impossible to have life on Mars since there's no water...well now they just found there is actually water underground, AND an Australian research just reported that a meteorite from Mars found 35 years ago contain fossils of micro lifeforms, ie, alien lifeforms.<br /><br />We need to keep an open mind on these evidences thatare presented to us, and open up the possibilities. I am not saying Daniken is 100% correct, because even he does not want to draw a conclusion (unlike the academis historians who think they are always right), but all he wants is to ask possible questions that face us as we are faced with the artifacts. History does not belong to the historians, so dont let them tell you that if they say ancient men are dumb cavemen, then it is the truth. Open up.	2000-12-19

If you wanna change something no matter how small it is, you gotto ge WILLING to TAKE THE ACTION to change it. <br />Many people finished reading the book and say,&quot;Hey my life's still the same, no change&quot;.This is the clearest example of the saying that Tony always say &quot; Many people know what to do, BUT they don't do what they know.&quot;<br /><br />The thing is, IT'S ACTION THAT CHANGES YOUR LIFE, NOT JUST KNOWING IT. Ralph Waldo Emerson said &quot;What you do shouts so loudly at me that I cannot hear what you are saying.&quot; It's an age old problem. So don't blame the author if you haven't changed your life.

Reid explains it in a clear way that's easy to read for Westerners.  Personally, I've tried Chi Gung and it does really increase my energy and  vitality and clarity. Especially the breathing exercises, god if there's  one thing you should improve to make your vitality 'explode', it's by  improving your BREATHING. Even Anthony Robbins teaches the 'power of  breathing'! So it's not traditional mumbo jumbo. What chi gung is mainly  about is, Chi (Air/Energy) Gong (Work/practice) that's what it means!  Overall, this is a good guide for those who wants to know what chi gung is.  You might also want to read another good book by the same author &quot;The  Tao Of Health, Sex and Longvity&quot;, it's a thicker book but it covers  more subjects like diet, nutrition,fasting,breathing,exercises,correct  sexual practice for vitality,meditation etc. Read it and most importantly,  USE IT AND DO IT!	2000-07-10

This book teaches you from how to get yourself ready to have a relationship, to what about men that women are attracted to, to how to win her heart, to how to break off with a woman who's not your ideal, for  example an emotionally unbalanced girl. And lots more. To tell the truth, I  only accept the things that fit into my personal value (my integrity), like  the strategy to get a date, to make people like you, but I just discard  some of the other stuff that don't fit my values. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW  EVERYTHING THE AUTHOR SAYS LIKE ITS A CULT RULE! Most of the strategies on  how to get dates are really practical and useful. I've used some of em  before I got this book and they worked perfectly, but now I know WHY and  HOW they really work, what's essential and what's idiocyncratic. So I can  refine my dating and social skills. Evrything in life needs a STRATEGY. You  need a strategy to get good grades in school, you need one to earn money,  and you need one to get dates! If you don't need strategy, you'd be able to  get dates in your pyjamas and smell of morning breath! Women have strategy  to get dates too- they put make up, wear their best, be polite. But what do  men do? This book will show you how. It will also show you how to get rid  of the fear of failure and rejection. Cos I understand many guys,  ESPECIALLY NICE GUYS with a heart who're looking for real relationship are  afraid of rejection, and that's why they don't take action, and the jerks  do (sorry to the jerks out there). Read this book!	2000-06-21

Well, the way Tony gives seminar is really admirable- he's really energetic, funny, congruent, and he gets his points across effectively. Most of the section is recorded  from his real seminar, and it's great! However this version is a little bit  too short, maybe it's Simon &amp; Shcuster's fault cos they always release  such short audios. There's another version of Unlimited Power, it has 6  cassettes, it;s a fuller versions with lots of NLP skills. That version is  released by Nightangale-Conant if I'm not mistaken. I listen to that 6 tape  sets every now and then. The format is very similar to this tape, with Tony  in studio and seminars teaching you the skills, but this version is only  about 50 mins long.	2000-06-21

Anthony RObbins used to be co-partners with the authors of this book, and Tony himself follows the diet in this book. You will notice Tony sharing some of the diet in Unlimited Power. And notice how much energy and vitality Tony has! Food combination may not make sense to you at first, but  if you put yourself to the test, that is try eating a meal with rice, eggs  and meat together, note how you feel after that. Then the next day, eat  carbo without protein mixed. You will feel that you wont feel so tired  after that meal, more energy and you can eat more, because the food is  turned into energy so quickly. Mixing different type of food makes it hard  or imposiible to digest, causing weight gain and constipation. Howerver,  the cutting of protein from diet altogether, although was great- i tried it  and my energy increased- but I also wanted to build up my body, so i need  protein for muscle building etc. Many other topics are worth a good read,  and test it for yourself before you make any judgement. I think most of  whats in this book is great and healthy, except I don't follow the 'aviod  meat for protein' rule now, at least until I have gained my ideal body mass  and muscle. If you're overweight however, you will find you can lose weight  easily, without cutting down on meals. A healthy diet guide. Also a good  guide is Shelton's &quot;FOod Combining Made Easy&quot;, .............	2000-06-19

This tape really taught me how to concentrate, meditate and reprogram myself. Hans De Jong takes you from total full consciousness (Beta level), to the Alpha level in just minutes. At this level you can reprogram your  health and heal illness. Personally, few years back I had a bad weak throat  and loss of voice. I used the silva method taught in this tape here, and  did some reprogramming. The next morning I awoke with a clear sharp voice  and soothing throat! No its not coincidence, cos I've had that problem for  quite a few weeks, and it healed the night I reprogrammed. If you're going  to try this program (which has helped millions of people since 1966), you  got to be more open minded and educate yourself on how your mind works!  Well, reading the SIlva books explained how it works for me and the steps,  listening to Hans' tape helped me practice correctly with Hans' guidance!	2000-06-17

This is a great book if you want to improve your memory. The author teaches the reader how to file information in your mind for easy remembering when you need it. A great deal of association is used. From  numbers to objects, people's name and things. Visualisation is needed,  althought you do not need to visualise too vividly, so don't worry. A great  skill to learn and master. The thing is, you need to practice and use it  often so it becomes unconscious and automatic to you, like driving a car.  Students especially will profit from this.	2000-06-16

This is really a thick and quite a heavy book. Its a compilation of many of  Morphosis' work. Their &quot;Best Of..&quot; volume. This marvelous edition  is divided into 2 parts. The first part consist of many colourful computer  generated views, elevations, plans and 3D computer models etc of their  buildings. The 3D models give a good visual understanding of their  complicated but exciting buildings. The second part consist of essays by  Thom Mayne. The thing about Morphosis is Mayne's writing is clear. He  states his intention and theories clearly without getting out of the  subject of architecture much. He talks about the difference between a  project and a building which is a very good way of looking at architecture  today. The graphics and writing provide a very clear understanding of their  buildings. The bottom line is, if you like Morphosis, you'll love this book  among your collection.	2000-06-12

New research has shown that mixing different kinds of food in one go can rob you of energy instead of giving you energy! Do you  feel fatigue and sleepy after that big meal of rice with meat with eggs and  fish during lunch? You bet! Then after that you constipate! I've made a  guinea pig of myself and found it to be true! If I combine my food  properly, I don't feel sleepy after lunch, even if it was a big meal!Today,  more and more people are discovering the importance of food combining, and  many authors are recommending it. See books like &quot;The Tao Of Health,  Sex and Longevity&quot; by Daniel Reid. Food combining is one of the most  important thing Tony Robbins did to make his vitality explode!Here's a way  to see for yourself that it works. Try the strategies of this book a few  days, note your energy level and how you feel. Then go back to eating egg  with meat and rice or steak with potato, and you'll see the huge  difference. Remember this, you eat to gain energy, not to lose it! I  recommend this precious book to anyone who wants to change his health and  vitality.	2000-06-12

I just bought this book last year (1999) and its one of my fave already. Ernest Holmes is also the author of the popular book Science Of Mind. Frankly, his approach to Life is very wise and spiritual. His  interpretation of spiritual texts like the Indian Gita, the Upanishad, the  Bible etc, are truly practical and very wise. He knows how the mind works.  He knows how spiritual healing works. He sometimes uses metaphors on how  the mind works, and great metaphors they are! My favourite is his metaphor  of 'the law of mind is like the law of gravity. Put a furniture over here,  and gravity will hold it there. Think a thought and the law of mind will  manifest it according to your thought&quot;. Read this book and he can put  in you a faith in yourself or God so strong that it's unshakable.	2000-06-08

This is one of the best book about the mind that I've ever read! Dr Murphy gives examples after examples of how people used the power of their mind to solve problems, heal  seemingly incurable illness and to aquire success. The author himself used  this method to heal a skin maglinancy when he was young, and he's got  concrete results himself. &quot;Ask for bread, and you'll not be given  stone&quot;. And he has one of the most powerful technique to suggest to  the subconscious as well. And he tells you all about it in this book - what  works, why it works, what doesn't work. This is the best secret you want to  know in life. I often use this method to achieve things as well. In 1997, I  had this wish to do so well in my design project that my lecturer will  print it in the school magazine. Seemed an impossible task cos I used to be  an average student. Well, I achieved that goal within a year! You can use  your subconscious to attract the people you want to attract, get the help  you need from whomever can supply it, create oppourtunities for you. The  possibilities are limitless- because your subconsious is infinite and  unlimited. It is an Intelligence that listens to your command! GET THIS  BOOK! I will buy it even if it cost 3 times higher, because the secret  within cannot be put a price tag on!	2000-06-08

I have read almost every self-help book I can find, yet I wasn't changing. I knew a lot about self esteem etc, but it's as if I was waiting for ONE FINAL PIECE, the missing part of how to  succeed - in a big scale. And this book gave that to me. It's called  Personal Power. If you're like me, having read a lot, know a lot as well,  then you need that final piece. This book also gave me lots of effective  STRATEGIES to control my mind, and it's scientific. From this book, I used  the NLP 'swish technique' to get rid of my nail biting habit in just 2  minutes! That was just 2 months ago and I never bit it since( it actually  feels unnatural to do it now). Learn how to increse your energy level and  see your vitality 'explode'! There are many strategies in this book, many  of them from Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) a science that can change  your life, habits, fears, attitude, beliefs etc so quickly (in minutes!)  that you'll be surprised. How do you motivate yourself to do the things  that are good for you (eg study for that exam earlier) and feel happy doing  it, and how to de-motivate yourself (eg to eat that pizza). Once you learn  the skills in this book, your mind will be at your command literally  (instead of letting it run you). How do you create rapport with people and  even strangers so easily that they fell like they know you for a lifetime?  Another essential formula I learned from this book got rid of my fear of  failure that used to stop me from taking action. Since then, my life, my  confidence changed so much that I can hardly believe it.	2000-06-08

Carnegie started giving lectures about how to give effective public speaking early in the century... then his seminars grew, he found that  people were more interested to know about HOW TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE. His  lecture notes gradually grew into this book and it was an instant  bestseller! Very easy to read, with tons of examples from people - from  famous people like Emerson, Lincoln, Franklin, etc to normal people like  you and me. You'll see how applying his technique works like magic. Find  out what is the one thing that EVERYBODY WANTS and literally CRAVES for.  How do you make small talk and why is it so helpful in social situations? I  don't understand why there are people who say his technique is old or  manipulating etc... I would like to ask them one thing... what do you call  'manipulation' ?  If you want to look at things that way, WHY DON'T YOU say  putting make-up is manipulating (cos you're enhancing your real looks?), or  putting certain good smelling things are manipulating (cos you're puting  artificial smell?). Or if you say Carnegie is manipulating, then why not  say all form of communication is manipulation?  Frankly if you have some  friends you can communicate very well with, you are already using some part  of his method. It is NOT manipulating people- it's how to enhance your  communication skill, to give others sincerely what they want, and receive  what you want in return. Carnegie can be funny, his writing skills par  excellence. Read this and make yourself extremely popular with your friends  and WIN NEW FRIENDS easily!	2000-06-04

It's simple, clear, with lots of exercises, easily understood and it worked for me! One morning I awoke in my bed (I have been giving auto-suggestion to my mind for an OBE for about a week).  This morning, I went to the toilet, came back, and sensing my mind was  still in alpha level, I quiet my mind a while, just sitting there  meditating. Then i lay down to sleep... the next thing i knew i was awaken  by this shaking and rocking (it felt as if my bed was like a boat in the  sea). I was feeling dizzy yet awake. I thought &quot;hey this is what the  author said about the 'vibrations' before he had an OBE!&quot; I got scared  and yanked myself back into full consciousness by coming awake and the  shaking just disappeared... I guess I just wasn't ready for it. Nowadays, I  get dream experiences that are really vivid, and where I was THINKING  ANALYTHICALLY in my dream! Just today, I dreamed I got up and walked to my  living rooom and kitchen to make a cup of tea (I never take breakfast at  home)... later, when I was awake, I made a cup of tea exactly like in the  dream, and ONLY AFTER i drank the tea that I remembered I did that in my  dream just a while ago! PREMONITORY DREAMING? To prove this is not just a  coincidence, another time I had a dream I was photocopying some documents  and I got a card that wasnt mine. After I woke up, my sis asked me to go  photocopy something with her, abnd there we found a missing card with  credits in it!

Books	5	40	49	N	N	A prove that there's no death to the consciousness	READ THIS BOOK or ANY HAROLD SHERMAN BOOK. IT'LL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. Harold Sherman is the author of many ESP books. My favourite is &quot;How TO Make ESP Work For You&quot; and &quot;The Power Of Prayer&quot; since these are the 2 books that I own. I am sure if I own his other out of print books,  I'll love them too. I READ THIS BOOK once although I didn't own it. Sherman  goes from case example to another (with evidences) to convince us that the  dead watches over us before they move onto another plane of existence.  There's no death to the soul or consciousness, I am sure you already  believe that. And our subconscious is all connected at a deeper level  (hence we experience ESP sometimes). If people who read the BIBLE can talk  to God which is Divine Consciousness, why can't they accept that we can  communicate with all kinds of consciousness, since God includes the Whole  and Infinite? I see people talking to God or Jesus in their mind and they  have no problem with that. So why don't the reviewer below be more open  minded? Sherman was a deeply spiritual man who radiates an aura of  goodness, he was a very respected man in Arkansas and for those who knew  him. He did a pioneering long-distance telepathy experiment with Sir Hubert  Wilkins (the artic explorer). Wilkins was in the north pole on a rescue  mission in 1938, Sherman remained in New York, and 80% of SHerman's records  of Wilkin's activities were accurate! So accurate that he could record  Wilkin's thoughts! He trained and experimented with the power of the human  mind on himself. Once, he used ESP to save his very life from a deadly  throat infection. After years of experimenting, his mind got so sensitive  that he can make &quot;coincidences&quot; happen, read people (even  stranger's) thoughts-many times unintentionally. This proves that all  consciousness is connected at a deeper level of Mind! He used his ESP to  help people and sometimes helping the police to solve crime accurately. (...)	2000-06-02

A book where you can learn heaps from! Basically, Bandler/Grinder talks and teaches about hypnosis, theraphy, NLP and Milton  Erikson. The amazing thing about this type of hypnosis (Indirect Hypnosis)  is that you can hypnotise using embeded commands. Lets face it, almost all  communication, beliefs, thoughts are hypnosis. Everything is hypnosis.  Start thinking you're clumsy and you'll notice you actually are! The trick  is, we must choose to hypnotise and instil beliefs that are positive and  useful to us, not those that limit us! Bandler and Grinder models the  technique of Eriksson, one of the greatest hypno-thrapist in the world  before he passed away. Erikson was reknowned for being able to tell a  patient a story about a tomato plant (with embeded commands in the story)  to relieve the pain of the cancer patient! Totally unrelated story, but  indirectly, he's hypnotised his unconscious! A great read for those  interested.	2000-05-30

Until the day I learned about the  power of STATE from Tony and NLP. If you can get into a state, the thought  tendencies and emotions will flow out automatically from that particular  state! So if you're really always depressed and low, you can't just go and  change by thinking positive... you'll need to change your state- then  positive thoughts will flow naturally!

Lots of  unusual events there, some like a person being in 2 places at one time  (bi-location), levitating saints, non-eating saints etc.<br />Paramahansa's  teachings, along with Ernest Holmes (I also strongly recommend Holmes'  classic 'The Science Of Mind') have really influenced my view on life. No  man can live like an island. We were not put on this earth, lonely and  helpless. There's always an invisible counterpart/intelligence/energy  guiding us. Many years ago I used to be a 'logical man', who didnt believe  in God. But one day I prayed very sincerely (&quot;to God if he  exists&quot;) for an answer to a problem, and I got a miracle answer just  hours after that(a 'coincidence' that's 1 against a million!) Getting a  miracle answer like that shattered my old prejudice (lack of open  mindedness to accept a possibility of an Infinite Intelligence (God)?).<br />Read this book to find out more about the 'super-natural'. Paramahansa  explains how and why it happens. Read with an open mind, my dear skeptics.  Truely, is the world we see all there is?	2000-05-29

Silva developed the Silva Method many years ago. It is what he calls 'active meditation'.  People use this to solve problems, get results they desire, create  opportunities ( it really works! be more open minded!), cure illness  etc.<br />Personally, i used this method once to cure a bad throat and loss of  voice 2 years ago. I have had this weak voice and throat for weeks that  wouldnt heal. Then one night i decided to 'go to my level', i did some  visualisation and suggestion to myself, the next morning awoke with a great  soothing feeling and clear sharp voice back!<br />If you have read Emile  COue's books on Autosuggestion, or Dr Joseph Murphy's &quot;How To Use Your  Subconscious Mind&quot; etc, then u will understand how it works. Silva  takes it a step further by a scientific approach- inderstanding brainwaves  or brain levels. Alpha- Beta - Theta etc,,, these are the brainwaves or  cycles our brain function in. Silva method teaches you to get to Alpha -  the most 'intelligent/spiritual' level of all, because it is directly  connected to the subconscious at this level.<br />Lots of smart techniques  that work. To many, his method is much like NLP, although NLP was not yet  invented by Bandler(not until mid 70s) yet when Silva developed it. But  still there are some similarities between them.	2000-05-28

And there's no other person to learn it from other than Harold Sherman. He was the first (along with Sir Hubert Wilkins the artic explorer) to experiment with telepathy in the  1930s, with 80% of SHerman's 'guesses' being correct 'hits' of WIlkins'  activities in the north pole (Sherman was in the US while WIlkins was  travelling in the north pole). So how did Sherman use his mind to keep  track of Wilkins? No radios, no telegraphs, only his mind.     In later  years, he's learned more and more about the power of the mind. He used it  to safe his very life, when he caught a throat infection, and he 'prayed'  for a cure (eventhough his doctors said all of past 40 cases died in the  past). So by a series of 'coincidences' he finally met the only person in  the US who had the antidote.      He is the man who knows how to make  coincidences happen. I have learned much from Sherman and experimented his  method, now I can create coincidences to work for me.     You will learn  that man is not left alone helpless in this universe, but a greater power  serves us and gives us life. The more you connect to this power, the better  results you get in your prayers.    In this book, Sherman explains clearly  what you need to make prayers work. What's important, and what's  irrelevant. He gives examples from his own life and incredible examples of  others.	2000-05-19

US	49816338	R324C6B6B7N1A	0671791540	850378543	Awaken the Giant Within : How to Take Immediate Control of Your Mental, Emotional, Physical and Financial Destiny!	Books	5	12	13	N	N	A great book to break through limitations!	I first picked up this book in 1995... didn't get serious into reading it, as i just browsed through. But even as i was just browsing, I realised how intelligent this guy was. He is happy, has lots of motivation, lots of  Personal Power, and he makes lots of sense.  The thing is that we think  many things he writes about we already know (they make sense) but our  BIGGEST problem is that we KNOW WHAT TO DO, BUT WE DON'T DO WHAT WE KNOW!  Or perhaps we aren't persistant enough. Tony says :&quot;Knowing doesn't  change your life, doing does. You got to take MASSIVE action.&quot; But  how? He offers you his STRATEGIES!  Some of them are so simple you'll even  suspect if they'll work. BUt if you try them consistantly, you'll know they  do!  Then in 1999 i reread it again (more seriously this time) and bang!  My life changed. I applied what he said and I dropped my shyness and  insecurities. I became more passionate, confident, outspoken. Achieved my  goals. I was so shy before but now I can walk up to anyone to stike a  conversation, even strangers. I became so confident that I walk up to girls  and ask them out for dates. I realised that if you are shy or unhappy, it's  because you have RULES that sabotage you, and yet you think they are the  'right' rules. And your values contridict each other, you go up one day,  then down the next. No consistency! If you are going to get anything out of  this book, you've got to read it thoroughly. And I tell you once you get  your rules and values right, you'll fell congruent and happy. And you'll be  clear of what you want, what to do.	2000-04-19
