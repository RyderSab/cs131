US	52494909	R2BEXNJHI89M5X	1576738167	351551970	Redeeming Love	Books	5	1	1	N	N	5+++ - One of the most powerful books I've read!	This was one of the most incredible books I have read.  A wonderful human love story as the plot shows us God's unrelenting love for us all, even the worst sinners.  It shows us that if we listen and allow ourselves to believe, God will speak to us in that \\"small, still voice.\\"  I felt so many strong emotions reading this and ended with real tears flowing.  It helped me realize that I can have a love that is unconditional and boundless, even if my earthly \\"love\\" relationship is not.  My hope is that by living with the Father's love relationship, maybe I can get my earthly love relationship on a higher plane as well.  A must read!!!	2002-08-26

Usually I love her reads.  I was excited about revisiting the characters from the earlier medieval series she had done, but was disappointed that she didn't tell the original Erik's and Serena's story in more detail.  Also, like others have said, there was a bit too much detail on the manuscript trade.  I found myself nodding off or skipping over some parts.  Also, why did she even bother with the scenes with the Donavan's?  Wholly unrelated and useless to the story!!!  Hope Running Scared is better.	2002-06-25

FIrst night I made it 1/2 way through the book, and I'm a slow reader.  I really enjoyed the book, start to finish.  Characters were enjoyable, with both human dilemas and the suspense story line dilemas to deal with.	2002-06-25

I really enjoyed that Sam, our hero, had magic too.  Also the ties from Sam and Mia to the original silkie and witch was really neat.  I could have gone for another 50 pages or so of romance between Mia and Sam, but I think the story was very good as is.  A good read with some very nice magic!	2002-06-18

I found it just as I was trying to understand my less mature concept of a &quot;one God&quot; and justify it with the terrorism of Sept 11th.  I found the 7 levels of Spiritual Evolution enlightening to the point of finally helping me to understand how all &quot;religions&quot; give structures leading to behaviors such as judgement and them vs us thinking, while espousing One God, a God of Love.  While I was reading this book, I found myself looking for the mystics and more &quot;highly developed&quot; voices within my religion to find my own religion's answers to these tough questions.  All the great religions seem to have these opposing concepts and Deepra clearly illustrates why.  While it doesn't clearly show us then how to get to &quot;know God&quot; by direct experience, he gives us the kernel to go out and continue our serach.  And tying his model into a scientific framework helped me to bring both my scientific and spiritual minds together.  A valuable read!	2001-11-14

I so loved the Third Heiress that I bought this book on BJ's name alone!  It was disappointing!   I didn't find much to empathize with in this ghost at all; she made bad choices in life and was just mean as a ghost.  She wasn't just an innocent who was betrayed by others, so I never connected with her.  And the level of violence in this book was disappointing, especially in the sex scenes.  I think the story line had nice potential, but definitely got too far out there.  I did find it to be a page turner and had to finish the last section (Isabel) in 1 night, but as I pushed on I started thinking, &quot;Come on, this is too much.&quot;  And so many &quot;should have died then&quot; episodes!  Hopefully her next one will be more like The Third Heiress, where one could empathize with the ghost and the present day characters as well.	2001-08-16

I judge a good book by how I feel at the end, and for this one I didn't want it to end.  I wanted to read on and see how Bethany and Ryan lived their lives.  Most of us read romance for the fantasy of it; love at first sight, a can do hero that makes dreams come true, etc.  This book has that.  True some things are not up to fact, but this IS fiction.  I do agree with some of the negative reviews, in that the heroine was too helpless for a supposed L2 spinal cord injury.  And I doubt Ryan would really be wrestling with a power drive WC with such ease (300+ pounds, I don't think so!) But I enjoyed the romance and fell in love with Ryan early in the book.  It was fun and heartfelt!	2001-08-14

I liked Faith and Walker both, despite their prickly personalities.  There is enough &quot;self talk&quot; to understand why they are that way.  I also liked Faith and Walker together and Walker's &quot;Sugar&quot; reminded me of EL's &quot;Only You&quot; of her Only series.  I found it a little slow at the start, but by mid book didn't want to put it down.  I think we all feel a bit lukewarm when the words &quot;I love you&quot; aren't spoken outright in our romances, but I think it was implied strongly enough for me.  So I found this to be a good ending to the Donovan series.  Maybe not vintage EL, but certainly a good read.	2001-05-30

I was not disappointed!!  This book was really good, a page turner from early on, for more than just the romance too.  I really liked the depth of the romance, both the pain and joy.  I loved the characters, both Kate and Chance, and David as well; they all had a realness and depth to them.  The murder and suspense lines of the story were also well done.  It kept me turning pages until well into the night because I just had to find out how it would all be resolved.  My one complaint is the number of typos in the book.  One here or there is no big deal, but there were so many that at times it interrupted the flow of my reading.  Where were the editors?!  Anyway, get this book, you will think of it well after you are done reading it.	2001-03-19

I liked the story, but felt a bit adrift at the end.  I think the &quot;Wicked Promise&quot; was a bit better.  I liked the characters and all the twists in the plot, but expected a bit more tension in the end.  And I felt the epilogue could have been better, perhaps a little later in their lives?  Did they have more kids???  Anyway, it was a good read, definitely worth the time and money!	2000-11-01

It is more thriller/mystery/ghost story than romance, but has  enough romance in it to be worth it.  The story is tightly written and has  interesting twists and the ending is a surprise.  There are 2 story lines  unfolding throughout the book, that of the 1906-1909 romance and mystery  and the other of the story of the present day hero/heroine. Both story  lines have mysteries and intrigue. I found that when I just sat down to  read the first couple chapters to see what it was about, I could not quit  easily.  I finished this hefty book in 3 nights, having to force myself to  bed on the middle night at 2:00 am.  I was wishing I could just finish it  in one night, or not have to go to work!  It was tense, the love story was  appealing, and I am left with lots of thoughts of the characters, even now,  after I have finished the book.  I hope Joyce keeps writing them like this  one!	2000-08-10

I enjoyed her visiting the issue of twin relationships again (Dancing on the Wind).  I really enjoyed her treatment of Dom bringing Meriel back into the  world, and their romance.  I enjoyed visiting with the Kimbals again, and  now I'm going back to reread River of Fire.  I like how MJP loosely links  her books together, as I feel I am reading about old friends.  I anxiously  await The China Bride, as I liked how the conflict between Dom and Kyle was  resolved and was left with empathy for Kyle.  This is just a great read  altogether!	2000-07-21

I have always liked MJP because she approaches tough subjects and deals with them in a positive way.  I again enjoyed this book and her handling of such a difficult relational subject.  I think she shows how spousal abuse  is a more intricate problem than simply the man beating a woman, and that  it is a problem that is rooted in both spouses approaches/reactions to the  problem.  She wasn't blaming Kate, but showing that Kate had a role in the  problem, which is an important fact that is not usually dealt with.  I  appreciated the attempts to differentiate the types of abusers, and the  discussion that most abusers don't change.  And the attempt to show a  different type of abuser in another man other than Donovan (can't tell who,  or it will give away the story!)  I like MJP's stories because she does  show how people can grow, change and better themselves, despite severe  problems, when changing because of love and love of oneself.  Some problems  can be conquered!  If I came from an abusive past, like Donovan's, I  wouldn't want it to be cast in stone that I would have to repeat it without  the possibility for change.  I love the hope that MJP gives.   This one did  not disappoint!	2000-05-30

I read it when it first came out in '89 when my son was 2.  He is now 12 and we still use the strategies in the book.  I am excited to see that it has been revised.  I work in a  clinic for developmentally challenged kids and often recommend it to  families when their child presents with termpermental and behavioral  difficulties.  It is a great resource and the stories are funny and heart  warming.  Parents will see themselves with these kids and know there is  hope and help. Thanks!	2000-03-10

It's not up to Kat's usual suspensefulness as in her other spy stories, but I liked it alot anyway.  I found the love story much  more compelling.  I ended up going back and rereading the highlights of  their love story (and there were many) right after I finished reading the  story the first time.

I haven't read one of her books in a while and after reading  many other romance authors I am reminded of why she was instantly one of my  favorites!!  She writes chapters in such a way that you can't put the book  down, something always happens to keep you reading on into the wee hours of  the night.

I guess I had grown to love the arrogant, meddling, sweet  old man and Anna's quiet strength in the other stories so much that I truly  cried in the hospital scenes, not just a sniffly tear, but real ones.  I  loved Anna's strength and early woman's lib attitude.  She really was a  match for the arrogant Daniel.  Thanks Nora for the stories of this  wonderful family.

At times it was hard to read, because of some of the tragedies these 2 face, but their love is deep enough to pull them through.   I found the story very compelling, the characters wonderful, and the depth  of the emotions rich and rewarding. I had read Devil's Prize first, so knew  of the characters from that, and I'm so glad I finally found this one to  find out how their story came about.

This was one of those books I was up with late at  night 'cause I had to know what was going to happen.  And I enjoyed getting  to know the Donavons more.

Yesterday I finished this book, the last of the trilogy about the Quinn brothers.  I was obsessed with getting to the end, but now I'm sad because those characters are no longer in my life.  Nora did a great job of  portraying what it was like to come from different realities. She did a  wonderful job of dealing with the difficult subject of child abuse  (physical, sexual and emotional) and how that shapes the adults that emerge  from that type of life.  Best of all she shows the power of love, trust and  acceptance in healing battered spirits. The love stories, the development  of both familial love and romantic love, were powerful.  The characters  were so real, and of course the men were to die for.  And the thread of the  father's ghost and younger brother's rehabilitation throughout the three  stories is brilliant.  Nora has an extraordinary gift.  Thankfully she  shares it with us.	1999-01-13

Lowell's historical romances and fell in love with her  style.  This is the 2nd contemporary novel of hers I've read and again am  not disappointed.  I liked her strong females in the historicals, but the  females in the contemporaries are even stronger.  I can respect Cat's not  wanting to give in to selling out for Travis' money and having to do it the  hard way.  The depth Lowell takes you to in these 2 lives and their pain is  extraordinary.  I cried and laughed and was thrilled with the ending.  I  read this into the wee hours of the night and picked it up immediately in  the morning to finish it.	1998-08-26

After  exhausting all of her historical romances and reading several other authors  in the historical market, I decided to try this contemporay novel.  Guess I  needed a Lowell fix!  Anyway, I wasn't disappointed. As always, Lowell  paints the scenery and action so that I felt like I was right there.  And I  really enjoyed the characters and their stories.  And of course, the  romance was tense and hot.  This is one I'm sure I'll reread!	1998-08-23

I have to admit that when I first started this book, I wasn't sure of it.  It starts with this love slave concept and the assumptions of the Arabic culture being pressed on Sarita.  But you have to keep reading it.  This story is rich in its details about this culture and treats differences between cultures rather well, I thought.  It becomes a powerful love story that goes well beyond what the synopsis of the book offers.  Once I got to the half way point, I couldn't put this one down.	1998-07-28
