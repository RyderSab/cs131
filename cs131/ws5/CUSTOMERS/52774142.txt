When a close friend's name is spelled two different ways in a book and the church she was married in is misnamed (my mother lived in the town where the church is and was one of the crowd trying to peek at the newlywed Tatum O'Neal and John McEnroe) one starts to question how accurate the rest of the book is when such little care was taken to get even basic facts straight. On the other hand I find it remarkable that Ms. O'Neal hasn't said even worse things about her absolutely horrible father. I believe her to have moved on in her life and she is trying to be the best mother possible to her own children. The book is very interesting and I hope in a future edition the (more than 13 at my count) errors are corrected.	2005-05-04

The first book was started before we got out of the bookstore parking lot-fortunately the boyfriend was driving. I laughed so hard on the way home I had to race to the bathroom immediately upon arriving. The second book was read aloud in large part but I couldn't continue half the time because I was laughing too hard. Sections of book three? I couldn't even speak I was laughing so hard and all I could do was point to the passage I wanted my boyfriend to read.  <br /> <br />Between Mrs. Notaro's (the author's mother) attempts at the internet and passion for QVC, aunt-guilt, awful work supervisors and goofy men Laurie Notaro captures those aspects of life that we wish we could relate even a quarter as well in the telling.  <br /> <br />Not just for idiot action-adventure girls (see book one to determine if you are a member) this book makes a fine companion piece to my L.N. set and I look forward to enlarging the collection.	2004-08-29

Us women who just don't care about shaving our legs everyday, keeping our houses spotless and as long as the pets are fed and we eat at least decent one meal a day in between the candy bars and junk food we'll survive just fine, thank you. I absolutely adored her first book and started this one before I was out of the parking lot of the bookstore. Thank goodness I wasn't driving or it would have been really difficult to turn the pages and remember to signal. <BR>From &quot;mice&quot; to weird neighbors, Ms. Noaro notices and appreciates the truly inane things that make life really interesting and worthwhile. She's the funniest writer I've ever read and I hope she has many more books to come.<BR>Proving there really is someone out there who will love us just the way we are and then actually marry us turns into very <BR>stories. <BR>You know those things you talk about ONLY to your best women friends?

Note I said &quot;serious&quot; because it is most definitely not intended for the beginning chef or cook. The recipes are written with the intent of providing large quantities of prepared foods and can be quite complex.<BR>Ingredients may not be available in all areas and the &quot;average&quot; home kitchen will not have all the equipment necessary to produce some of the recipes. That said, the basics of the book including sections on nutrition and ingredients were a more interesting read than I had expected and I learned a great deal. The companion study guide helps to reinforce the information learned. <br />Covering all facets of cooking from sauces to desserts The Professional Chef provides an amazing amount of information in one text.	2003-06-25

At first working in the household solely as a maid and admiring his paintings Griet comes to assist the painter in producing his paintings from the grinding of materials which produce luscious sounding colors to becoming the subject of one of his 35 paintings. <BR>Written from the point of view of a young girl growing up in a working environment filled with the family of Vermeer including his many children, difficult wife and fascinating mother-in-law to the painter himself this book follows Griet's life for the several years that she stays with the family and becomes an integral part in the course of several paintings' completion.<BR>The author conveys well 17th century life from a young person's point of view but what is particularly well done is Griet's concept of her master's work. Developing a keen eye for color and crucial to the subtle work required in such gifted artistry she provides us with a view to works in progress from blank canvas to completed painting.<BR>An excellent book which is quite different from anything I've ever read.	2003-03-14

Yes!) to the current cast, this book presents a very large collection of recollections and musings from cast, crew, writers and some of the more frequent guest hosts. From the battles of the female writers to the varied recollections of Tom Hanks, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin, among many others, there is also much information to be gleaned about the basic workings of a long-running television show-political satire, goofy silliness as well as much cleverness included. <BR>A large portion of the book is devoted to Lorne Michaels which is both a fascinating read and annoying in parts because I would have preferred even more focus on the Not-Ready-For-Primetime Players past and present. <BR>A cast list is included for each year but a list of guest hosts, musical guests and sketches is not and would require an entirely different style of book (and would make a great book too!).<BR>As a reference tool, occasional read and/or cover-to-cover can't put down book this is an excellent biography of what I consider to be one of the best television shows ever produced.	2003-03-14

While the story of Eddie Fisher's career is interesting there is so much malicious gossip that it detracts from the basic story.<BR>Starting as a talented child and then through a very up and down career Mr. Fisher never had any doubts about his abilities professionally. Through his version of his marriages to Debbie Reynolds, Elizabeth Taylor, Connie Stevens and so forth we get all the dirt that we ever wanted to hear and then some. While I like a good &quot;Hollywood&quot; biography as much as the next person I've never read one that gave me so many details on people that I really didn't WANT to hear. Sometimes petty, sometimes shocking and frequently doubtful there's a lot of stuff in this book that really could and should have been left unsaid. A strong proponent of freedom of speech I also believe that much of what Mr. Fisher had to say was simply unkind and people who have since died like Montgomery Clift and Roddy McDowell are no longer able to defend themselves and to deny what is printed about themselves. <br />Although he never had any doubts about his singing ability Mr. Fisher is also quite self-effacing about his shortcomings as a husband, father and speaks openly about his addictions. What is probably the best aspect of the book is when the reader realizes how much Eddie Fisher has learned along his journey.<br />I wish him peace but I wish he didn't have to be so just plain mean in this version of his life.	2003-01-16

Although both books are similar in that they are about single sad/funny working British young women who would really like boyfriends that's about where the similarities end. After our heroine starts to become what seems like a totally different character I started to lose interest in the book and that was a big disappoint. I had so enjoyed the beginning and where the book seemed to be heading that as it progressed I had trouble reading further. <BR>While it is not predictable I do believe that it gets so unbelievable that any feeling for the characters we may have developed starts to go up in smoke. The secondary characters are well-written and a great deal of parts of the book are very good but without giving away the plot (which is very hard to do and get my point across in this review) I wish the author had stayed true to her original Jemima, the one we met at the beginning of the book and really liked.	2003-01-11

Divided into categories are many letters which on occasion appall but always hold our interest as we read the answers Mr. Cohen has written. There is much fodder for discussion here as of course the reader will not always agree with the author. This book makes a good basis upon which to discover how your friends and relations feel about many ethical issues.

In other words-he's a normal child. Rich in those details of New York City upper class shopping and dining seen from the person who gets to make the reservations and pick up the purchases without, for the most part, ever getting to actually eat and shop there, our heroine is just trying to make money to pay her rent and then seriously gets involved in the life of her young charge. With occasional glimpses into her college student life, her major is in the area of child-care, more frequent glimpses into her home life and attempts at romance, it is also the story of a young woman in New York City, not just her life as a nanny. I fully expect to see a television series based on the Nanny although it may not play well in the sticks. There are many references to NYC area restaurants, shops and other locations and I wonder if a person who is not familiar (I used to live in NYC) with New York City from other than television and movies would enjoy or \\"get\\" them. <br />I enjoyed reading the book, got wistful for the smells of New York and hope the authors write another book soon.	2002-12-16

While full of fascinating stories about the production itself the style of the author left a great deal to be desired. We follow the production of movie from beginning to end including facts about the author of a story originally printed in Cosmopolitan Magazine, &quot;The Wisdom of Eve&quot; that the movied was based on. In chronological order, following the movie itself (which is actually told in flashback/retrospect) we travel with the cast and crew as the plot of the movie unfolds and the stories behind the movie unfold. The only remaining cast member, Celeste Holm, declined to be interviewed for the book and I would love to read what she has to say in detail about the production. Gary Merrill and Bete Davis have both written interesting (and recommended by me) autobiographies, in Ms. Davis' case several, which include references to the making &quot;Eve&quot; and their affair during which ended with their subsequent marriage. <br />It's a good read for the story of the movie and some good Hollywood gossip but if I had a chance to edit this book I would have removed a fair amount of extraneous wording.	2002-12-12

With a strong focus on Cross' family in this book we swing back and forth between the hunt for a barbaric madman (or two) and life in the Cross household. Without giving out too many details, as usual, I will say that I'm starting to suspect that our hero will remain a bachelor. Every time an interesting woman character is added to the mix the plot thickens and increasingly the plots are becoming more and more farfetched-so much so that I actually sat reading this book and shaking my head. What gives it the three stars is still the wonderfully written and explored Alex Cross character.	2002-12-08

I was much more intrigued and definitely more spooked by the criminal element in this book. As anyone who has read an Amazon book review by me knows I don't give away very many plot details or a synopsis of the book-better writers than I create more detailed reviews that include them. Alex Cross is an absolutely fascinating character and I can't wait to read more in this series. In this book the characters are explored more fully than the first book and you may get so scared that you sleep with your lights on! The book also makes you think about those twisted members of our society who walk around under the aegis of \\"normalcy\\" and have secret lives that we know nothing about but if we did? We'd run like hell if we saw them coming. <BR>I particularly liked the character of Kate McTiernan which was played to perfection by Ashley Judd in the movie version. <BR>Sometimes it is better to read the book first then see the movie but in the case of Kiss the Girls I think it's better to see the movie first then \\"flesh out the details\\" with the book.

While I WILL read the second book and hope it is better written, in general I was disappointed with the quality of the writing and definitely do not think it is James Patterson's best effort.

The main character, Detective (and Phd. in Psychology) Alex Cross is a fascinating character. Two of the other major characters weren't as well developed as I would have liked and after finishing the book I felt I was left with a lack of enough information to fully understand (and in the case of one of them-barely understood) the &quot;why&quot; of crime committed. I don't want to give out too much information about the book and risk spoiling it for anyone but I definitely wouldn't have seen the end coming if I hadn't already seen the movie.<BR>Make sure to read Kiss the Girls next!

Before I had finished half the book I was re-evaluating my portfolio based on what I had already learned from Ms. Orman's book. Basic investing is explained from IRAs, to money-market and mutual funds in simple terms but without condescending to the reader. Ms. Orman believes in long-term planning and you will not find a &quot;get-rich-quick&quot; scheme in this book.  There are many money-saving tips as well and advise on estate planning.	2002-04-01

There was a great deal I  didn't know about Esther Williams prior to reading her book and was pleasantly surprised to find out what an interesting woman she is! She speaks openly about her co-workers (other movie &quot;stars&quot;), the education she received from making movies and the studio system and her family life. An astute businesswoman as well, Ms. Williams was also very involved in synchronized swimming including its induction into the Olympics. I was surprised to find that I had a hard time putting the book down.	2002-04-01

The book has many subplots, the most interesting being her relationships with her mother and sister and her marriage to Jose Ferrer.	2002-01-31

It is rich in details with a great number of footnotes. Although at times the chemisty is hard to understand, what shines through is the author's love for the science of not just chemisty per se but photography and nature as well.	2002-01-31

As the week goes on each day's puzzles are designed to be harder to solve but I noted a greater increase in difficulty between this book and &quot;Tuesday&quot; as opposed to the differences between the &quot;Monday&quot; and &quot;Tuesday&quot; books. All the books in the series are well-edited and I have found no errors. The book is somewhat awkward to use since paperbooks are not the easiest format for crossword puzzles unless they lay flat.	2002-01-31

Ms. Shepherd's autobiography is a rather fast read with details from childhood through recent pursuits. What came as a surprise was the intelligence that shines through in a woman who is much more than an actress/model but also a bright,and interesting woman. Details abound on her television series, movies and especially co-workers. If you want a candid memoir of modeling and acting from the female side this book is for you.	2002-01-16

Ruth Reichl's second autobiography is better than her first which was a wonderful surprise since the first was so good! It is funny, educational, and heartbreaking in parts. Again including recipes which you will want to try, Ms. Reichl writes mouth-watering food descriptions which will conjure pictures like no other food writer I have read. Read it for the biography of a chef, food critic and Editor-in-Chief of Gourmet Magazine or read it as the story of a woman growing up and growing in the 60's and 70's. Food, ingredients, and travels are described in glorious detail. I look forward to reading more of Ruth Reichl's writing.	2002-01-02

Maura Jacobson constructs the weekly crosswords in New York Magazine and has several crossword collections available. The spiral binding makes the book easy to write on. While I was surprised at the number of typographical errors I found they did not detract from my enjoyment of Ms. Jacobson's puzzles. The themes are clever, the puzzles are challenging but not impossible to complete and I look forward to the next book in the series. In the meantime I grab New York Magazine and complete a weekly puzzle longing for more.	2002-01-02

I was eagerly looking forward to reading Ms. Reichl's first autobiography and was absolutely hooked by the second page. It was so good that I reread several pages out loud to my boyfriend. As the daughter of a woman who cooked either disasters or triumphs I identified with Ms. Reichl immediately. I also learned a great deal from both this book and her next Comfort Me With Apples. I realized that I both knew more than I thought about &quot;food&quot; but have quite a long way to go to really know food. Ms. Reichl's writing will have you in tears, laughing and hungry depending on the chapter. The recipes included fit so beautifully in the storyline and you will want to try them yourself.	2002-01-02

This Simon and Schuster series of crossword puzzles follows the same format of 50 puzzles per book. The cruciverbalists (crossword constructors) vary from puzzle to puzzle which makes for a variety of construction styles. The themed puzzles vary somewhat in difficulty and some are quite challenging. I recommend this series of books highly  for one rather different reason as well-the paper the puzzles are printed on is very tough, quite erasable and a clear white which makes it easier to fill out puzzles in pencil (and correct mistakes). Puzzling aficionados will tell you-paper quality is important! You will find all the puzzles fun and a certain satisfaction in completing each one.	2001-08-01

After having read all four Harry Potter books three times each I am going through withdrawal. I wish I didn't have to wait a year or more for the next book so I bought the two schoolbooks. Of all the books I have read as an adult I have found some of the greatest reading joy in Harry Potter. Those of us who grew up as nerds, unathletic, and/or non-cliquey people will feel at home at Hogwarts. Those readers who haven't will still love reading these books. As each book unfolded I saw parallels between the Hogwarts world and the Star Wars films. Both promote a sense of  a loner learning to thrive in a world where you are just a little bit (or maybe more than a little) different from everyone else. Harry is creative, intelligent, and interesting You will find yourself rooting him on as each book finds him confronting evil and I'm not going to spoil anything by saying any details! Don't skip these books because  you consider yourself a &quot;grown-up&quot; and too adult to read them.	2001-07-11

Ms. Morganstern goes into the psychology of packrathood in detail and each of us will probably find ourselves in one of her descriptions. I never knew I could be so organized and do it without stressing out over where to get started, what to throw out and what to keep. By following Ms. Morganstern's advice and reading ALL of the first few chapters of her book BEFORE you dive in to organize you will find yourself going in a more step by step fashion and ending up with far better results than if you skip straight to the chapter with the room you want to organize  first. As a recovering slob I recommend this book highly.	2001-07-11

Thomas Harris has written a third book about Dr. Hannibal Lecter and this one is the most intriguing.

It never ceases to amaze me when a male author captures &quot;us&quot; with as much clarity and sensitivity as Wally Lamb has done in this book.  This is perhaps a rather sexist comment but Mr. Lamb has an uncanny ability  to give me goosebumps when I read about weight, sex and mothers. He hits  home with his book about Dolores, a young frustrated misfit who has an  astonishingly difficult life most of the time. It's also a funny book at  times and often poignant. I can't wait to read more of Mr. Lamb's work.	2000-06-25

It is almost agonizing to read in parts but you will come away from it looking at  others differently. Those who have never lived in an abusive environment  have absolutely no clue what it can be like to live a life like Fran  Benedetto and her son Robert.   After finishing the book you will find  yourself thinking of Fran and her son and in fact haunted by them.  Anna  Quindlen has become someone whose books I will read simply because she has  written them. There is no need to wait for reviews and bestseller lists as  she will write something extremely worthwhile in reading. I know that I'll  finish her next book having learned something as well, something about  human spirit and fortitude.	2000-06-25

In One True Thing we read the story of a young woman whose mother is diagnosed with cancer  very early on in the book. As the book progresses we begin to care very  much about Ellen and her family. The book does not drown us in medical  jargon nor are we spoken down to yet we understand fully the exact nature  of Ellen's mother's illness. Every facet of Ellen's life changes during the  course of the book. She is an aspiring journalist, has moved out on her own  and must move back home to care for her mother. Ellen's relationship with  her professor father is fascinating, as a daughter learns that her father  isn't the perfect man she thought he was. While I expected a predictable  outcome I was surprised because the book did not go in the directions we  would assume. Very well written and gut-wrenching as it is, I was left with  a strong opinion of Ms. Quindlen's abilities as a writer.	2000-06-25
