No, that's not a quote from Gichin Funakoshi or Moriei Uyeshiba. That's from Ian Fleming's &#34;From Russia with Love.&#34; The Gracies agree. The bad news is that we're told that 'There is no Santa Claus' against multiple opponents, so wannabe James Bonds are out of luck. The good news is that when Royce Gracie entered the 'Ultimate Fighting Championship' he was able to do what most martial arts promised but could not deliver; consistently defeat much larger men. At 170 lbs soaking wet, Royce kept winning  against Sumo, Greco-Roman wrestlers,  Boxers and Karateka-- as did the rest of his family.  Fleming would have approved of their methodology. The Gracies had tons of  experience, Brazilian law did not forbid no-holds barred challenges. A bit of a throwback to the 19th century catch wrestling matches, if not quite The Wild West . . . This book covers the beginning of the Gracie clan's ascencion to prominence. The authors make the point that martial arts which teach 'deadly moves' e.g; eye-gouging, shuto throat strikes and such are weaker than those which practise safe techniques--an easily explained paradox in their view, since the 'deadly' ones (Karate and Ryu-style Ju-Jitsu) have to remain theoretical--not too many students being willing to get their throats crushed in practise; whereas boxing and Judo spend most of their time in sparring safely against a training partner-that is not being cooperative. Thus they have nothing but the highest praise for Jigoro Kano, founder of Judo. Indeed their 'lineage'is traced back to him via Mitsuyo Maeda,(1871-1941) a Judoka who saw Judo lose to the Fusen-Ryu school of Jujitsu. This was the first time Kodokan Judo had EVER lost against the 'theoretical' schools Fusen Ryu employed ground grappling. Kano added this to Judo and  Fusen Ryu was 'incorporated' into Japan's official national sport--but not before Yukio Tani, a Fusen-Ryu stylist traveled to England around 1900 and defeated all comers, sometimes fighting as many as 50 a week. He only weighed 125 lbs. In any case Maeda moved to Brazil followed Yukio's example and quickly adapting to foreigners who wrestled without a gi, boxed, etc. He then met and befriended Carlos Gracie, and the rest, as they say is history. . . --------------------------------------- This book shows some of the most basic (read effective) holds, takedowns and submissions in BJJ. It also treads on some toes by stating that the cherished concept in JKD about 'ranges of combat' (kicking, boxing, trapping and grappling) has proven to be false. A flying knee can be long range and a grappler who has his mind set on a clinch and takedown from 15 feet away, will indeed, take you down. A possible weakness is the dogma that 'all fights end up on the ground' which the authors sometimes amend to 'most fights between usnkilled opponents' etc. The reality is that BJJ confesses to having no defense against two or more opponents save running or looking around for 'improvised weapons'-- See chapter 10, JuJitsu for self defense. But there is a lot of data in which a boxer a karateka or a good street fighterhas indeed prevailed aginst two men---and more. Ask around your friendly local barroom bouncers, LEO's , and MP's. Come to think of it, many in the military police and other similar organizations think the world of the hand to hand combat developed by the likes of Fairbarns, Sykes and other commando trainers from WW2--which are indeed 'theoretical' Furthermore with the introduction of 'Redman' and other protective suits and gear, the gap between theoretical and practical is closing. Lastly, and I know I'm nitpicking--I think the world of the Gracies--Bruce Lee would be somewhat taken aback by the statement that the roundhouse &#34; Can be safely regarded as the 'king of kicks' &#34;.  Here the authors are referring to Thai low roundhouse using the shin to attack a boxer's leg. I'm surprised the authors did not follow their own logical conclusion, that the low side thrust kick to the leading leg of the opponent does not exist in Thai boxing because it's too dangerous and thus is 'theoretical', but might prove quite handy in a real fight , just as Bruce thought. In any case, all martial artists can be gratefull to the Gracies for putting back some perspective into what works and doesn't, as well as for founding an organization where it does take years of hard work to earn a 1st degree black belt, as opposed to--well I'm too much of a gentleman to name names but if you've been around the MA scene, you know the score- and where possesing one actually means that yes, you can handle yourself in a fight-- WHAT A CONCEPT ! Outstanding book.	2004-02-29

Welcome to the Magic Kingdom: Saudi Arabia.  Former Middle East CIA operative Robert Baer, author of the critically acclaimed memoir 'See No Evil' follows up that work with a brilliant expose at the world's best funded breeding ground for terrorists, our allies (?) The Saudis. &#34; We had hardwired in our brains the stereotype of young , oil-rich brats screaming at their Filipino servants to take the wrappers off their candy . . .Sept 11 undid that stereotype for me &#34;  By 'we' he means CIA and other official Mid-East think tanks. If they were so far off, what did the average American know? The Saudis were our buddies, they had never gone to war against Israel and they probably celebrated the 4th of July with fireworks. . . An image that Baer contends was sold to the American people, because half of Washington was bribed and the other had their heads buried in the sand. ----------------------------------------------------------------- A few items: 1. Osama, as we all know is  a Suadi. In fact, to many opposing the royal family (about every Saudi that's not a millionaire) he's a national hero. Fifteen of the 9/11 hijakers were Saudi nationals. Ditto for aprox 75% of the al Qaeda prisoners subsequently held at Guantanamo &#34;the worst of the worst.&#34;  2. Back in 1996 when Sudan had Osama in custody, The Saudi government declined the offer to have him extradited back home. Reason? He was too popular, let him go. . .  3. Saudi citizens blew up the National Guard facility in '95 and the Khobar barracks in '96. Two Saudis and one Egyptian hijacked a plane to Baghdad in 2000. Saudis were almost certainly behind the atttack on the USS Cole as well as hundreds of other terrorists activities prior to 9/11 from Kenya to Chechnya-- and yet, unlike say, an Argentinian or a Frenchman, Saudis did not have to bother to appear at a screening at an American embassy or consulate to get to the US. A system called  'Visa Express' took care of it for a fee. In other words, any Saudi travel agent stood in place of the American government. Baer tells us that under this system, Osama himself could have gotten through.  4.The Saudi government has not allowed the FBI or any US agency to question the relatives or associates of the 9/11 hijackers despite repeated requests.  5. The Royal Family is demented. Made up of five extended 'dysfunctional' families presently run by King Fahd's favorite wife, Jawara and her son Abd-al Aziz, or Azuzi ('deary' as Mommy calls him ) they spend more money than France on their 'army' --a praetorian palace guard.  6. There is no rule of law, it's a Mafia chieftain's paradise run by deary. Leaders of the world in public beheadings (Riyadh plaza is commonly known as Chop-Chop square) The Royals hedge their bets by supporting universities which are, in fact, ultra fundamentalist Anti American hate camps.  7. Further hedging are shows of piety put on by their muttawa, the public-decency police; which performs the useful function of beating women on the legs and arms if their robes are too short. In March 2002 it blocked the exit of a girl's school on fire because the girls weren't properly covered. Fourteen died. Not unusual in a country which Baer contends is 'the most sexually repressed on earth' Women are kept out of touch with men until the day they marry. A woman cannot drive. Only 5% of them work;  if she needs to go anywhere a male relative must chauffer and chaperone her. In desperation, Saudi men have written their cell phones and taped it to cars they are trying to 'sell' in the hope some brazen Saudi girl will call them--even if they risk public stoning. These are the poorer Saudis. As to the rich, it's THE Middle Eastern joke that Saudis spend a staggering amount of its GDP on sex--in Europe's red light districts.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- What is less than amusing is that this 'hedging' with terrorists cannot go on forever. The Royals are bribing the people who would cheerfully execute them. Plus, with the availability of MAJOR weapons of destruction from the former USSR for sale---a point which Baer goes into in the very first chapter, as he talks to a Russian arms dealer who is stationed at a luxury resort in--of all places, Israel, The Royals may meet their end and then it's anyone's guess who will run the country with the essential oil reserves The West needs to function, but it's doubtfull it'll be a group of tolerant Ghandi-like pacifists.  Baer has done it again.  Great research and great reading.	2004-01-09

(Hey, what a catchy title for a play !) A poor man's &quot; North by Northwest&quot;  wherein a mariachi looking for a job gets mistaken for a killer seeking revenge because they carry identical guitar cases.<br /> It's a funny, fast paced and an extremely well plotted film,  shot without a crew and only one camera. Rodriguez used a wheelchair for a dolly and a ladder for a crane.  It works beautifully.<br />He recounts his adventures, including raising money by submitting to medical experiments, in this --to some--inspiring book. <br />I say 'to some' because if you  want to get  a rise out of an aspiring director who is working &quot;through the system&quot; i.e; editors, directors of photography, cameramen, 2nd A.D.'s, the guy brings the coffee, in short ANYONE in crew on a Hollywood set or in postproduction,  all you have to do is casually mention 'El Mariachi' and they'll start grousing about how it really cost a million bucks after it got picked up to bring it up to quality prior to release.<br />Hmm. . .slightly untrue but a face saving urban myth. In a few years they'll be saying it took 10 million.<br />They're not alone. Film schools and some other Indie filmakers also dislike him.<br />Why? <br />Simple.<br />Rodriguez is a throwback to the Golden Era of silent films and the early twenties, prior to the star/ agent system. <br />  (Gee, however did D. W. Griffith or Erich von Stroheim manage it without ever having attended a film school? Boggles the mind, doesn't it? )<br /> BTW, Rodriguez' appendix 'The Ten Minute Film Course ' is worth the price of the book alone. Cheap really, considering he tells you how to save 20k from a school that will , after all is said and done, qualify you after four years to be the guy that brings the coffee to the set--or if you're extremely well connected and lucky, the 2nd A.D. <br />Which explains the dislike from both film schools and wannabe directors who already plunked downn their dough and have little to show for it ten to twenty years after.<br />But why would some Indie directors dislike one of their own? <br />Simple again. <br />Envy.<br />You see we have now a new myth in town--similar to the myth in the 40's that you were going to get 'discovered' sitting at Schwab's cafeteria , namely the myth of the YOUNG FILMAKER.<br />HEY KIDS, LET'S PUT TOGETHER OUR MASTERCARDS, SHOOT A LOW BUDGET FILM AND HAVE IT PLAY IN THE FESTIVAL CIRCUIT!<br />Good luck.<br />The truth is that for every Robert Rodriguez there's ten thousand intolerable idiots who couldn't direct traffic, let alone a film, and whose idea of writing a 'small movie' is a self indulgent sentimental auto biographical P.O.S. about the meaning of life, which ususally means  scenes with teenagers drinking espresso and talking about their angst, or a study of a failed relationship, or a cynically dark vision from hell,  or the plight of the (fill in the blank).<br />Zzzzzzz....................<br />But well written with a good plot? Forget about it! A comedy? Unimaginable.<br />After Mariachi's success, R. R. was  given money (and a crew!) for his subsequent projects. He amazed the establishment by shooting as many as 70 camera set ups on a single day! <br />Well, why not? Without stars demanding changes to the script (Please read 'Adventures in The Screen Trade ' by William Goldman ) and other idiocies, it can and has been done.  <br />Furthermore R.R. believes that the reason overblown  and overbudgeted Hollywood productions are usually so stale is because of all the waiting  actors have to do as the crew lights  and sets up the next shot ( Oh, about 3 hours each on a good day ) which robs actors of energy and films of their vitality.<br />Along with  Goldman's books  ( He folllowed up with 'Which Lie Did I Tell? ' ) and Robert Evans 'The Kid Stays in The Picture' R.R's book is among the wisest and wittiest renderings on Hollyweird.	2004-01-03

Over a hundred years ago Edwin Booth and other greats toured England performing Shakespeare. The idea of American actors touring England these days, performing Shakespeare--or any of the classics---is about as far fetched as as a rap group, a mariachi band or The Dixie Chicks touring Rome performing Verdi.<br />What went wrong?<br />Why did critics give James Earl Jones good reviews as the judge  in an Ibsen play but felt compelled to inform you that, just in case you didn't know it, there were no black judges in 19th century Norway---and yet felt no need whatever to point out that, just in case you didn't know it, they spoke (unlike Jones and the other actors in the play) Norwegian,  not English?<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />Hornby examines conventions so ingrained in American acting training, that we're not even aware they're conventions any longer. <br />His main target is the indubitable Lee Strasberg and his followers. Hornby is not so much anti-Method as he is pro-Stanislavsky.  Using examples and photos from actors as varied as Marlon Brando, Humphrey Bogart and W.C. Fields; his section on 'Stanislavsky's Basic Theories' is worth the price of the book alone.<br />Hornby's  critique against Lee's guru/teacher offsprings is that among many sins, they 'train' actors in the manner of a football coach who runs all sorts of endless exercises but never actually lets the team play in a real game. <br />If they did reality would set in and the con-job would be over. Actors are of course equally guilty in perpetuating the con out of their own fear--if they actually had to audition, get hired and depend upon the audience's pleasure to earn a living in the theater--Gee, they'd be rather like the English wouldn't they?<br />As it is they can stay in the sidelines and talk forever as they examine all their 'flaws' in labs/studio/workshops, but do not  have to dirty their hands battling in the arena.<br />Equally guilty, in his eyes, are the pundits that run American Theater Arts departments at universities. Even those who are not the offspring of Lee & co, encourage actors to 'play themselves' to such an absurd degree that Hornby notes that the late Peter Sellers could not have passsed the audition for an  entrance exam. he could not 'play himself'.  Olivier would have probably fared equally badly, and of course Meryl Streep regularly gets  put down for using accents, i.e; for ACTING. Even if the accent is required in the role.<br />The book begins with a section entitled the psycho-sexual basis of acting, which quotes Freud extensively and is a bit long winded. Not badly written by any means, just that the points that acting is fun because the lines of ego are not so rigidly drawn as one thinks, that actors are considered 'childish' by those who hate their own jobs (Oh, 90% of the public), The common distrust towards people who pretend to be someone else--all this was  better stated in David Mamet's \\"True and False\\", when he observed that, in the Middle Ages, actors were buried at a crossroad---with a stake through the heart. \\"An awesome compliment\\"<br />Nevertheless, this is truly a 5 star book, and contains more constructive critique than Mamet's. <br /> Absolutely required reading for any actor or director.	2003-09-17

Mamet is an excellent critic but a muddled theoretician and his advice ends up sounding as dogmatic as Stanislavsky and as reductionist as Strassberg.<br />Lee's \\"Method\\" appropiated one of Stanislavsky's early theories and absorbed all of the others into it, unintentinally (?) giving them secondary status. This theory was and is 'Affective Memory' ( or as Mamet refers to it , the acting equivalent of 'paint-by-the numbers') wherein an actor would remember experiences that had moved him in his past and then tie them or substitute them to the character he was portraying them to infuse it with 'truth'.<br />Interestingly,  99% of Affective Memory exercises deal with past pain: Your father's death, your sister's suicide, uncle Ethelbert molesting you in the closet when you were 9, etc. <br />This leads to some bummed out acting sessions and practising guru-psychoanalyst-con men. (I refer to Harold Clurman's remarks on Lee as quoted in 'Acting without Agony' by Don Richardson ) and more importantly to a new convention as artificial as the 19th century's dictum that an actor should not turn his back on the audience while exiting the stage; namely the dogma of REAL TEARS.<br />Method loons are fond of contrasting 'indicating' which is bad with 'truthfulness' which is neato, and the yardstick generally employed is REAL TEARS. <br />Thus whether you're playing Hamlet in his \\"O What a rogue\\" speech or Felix Ungar in The Odd Couple in the scene where he shows a photograph of his family to the two cuties, the scene specifies weeping and thus the true actor will cry REAL TEARS. <br />Never mind that one's a classical drama and the other's a comedy, that's irrelevent and The Method wants you to cry. So go to class, remember personal tragedies, and suffer agony for art's sake.<br />Mamet makes fun of this lunacy and defends the primacy of the play, of the written word. Acting is after all, an interpretive, performing, and secondary art to writing. Here he is on solid ground , following Bertol Brecht's gripe that Stanislavskian actors mangled the author's work just so they could commit an \\"emotional striptease\\" on the stage.<br />But what advice does he offer instead?<br />Well there are some 'common sense' gems such as  his request  not to indulge in \\"Funny Voices\\" and to let the audience teach you, rather than stay in school/studio/labs/workshops forever. <br />But after all is said and done, he goes back to \\"that hack\\" Stanislavsky and his famous saying that the person you are is infinitely more interesting that any character you could act. Thus he ultimately advises stepping out on stage as yourself, picking a simple objective (which will give 'the illusion' of the character) and BEING BRAVE.<br />This is a wee bit silly since characters are not created quite THAT simply. At the risk of repetition, it is as reductionist of Stanislavsky as anything Lee ever came up with.<br />Mamet, like Brecht and unlike say, William Saroyan or Anton Chekhov is not exactly known for the warmth of his characters. Perhaps this has something to do with his attitude.<br />For a far less vehement and more constructive ctitique try \\"The End of Acting\\" by Richard Hornby.	2003-09-03

It's a story about good and evil without a single false note of sentimentality. Dostoevsky would have loved it. The humor is macabre, ironic, and serves as a great counterpoint to the action. Too many instances to mention, though the passage where a mother reads a sanitized version of the suffering of the Ever So Brave Saints to her child, while a real martyr is being led to the firing squad is outstanding.  The setting is Mexico in the 30's when Christianity was outlawed. The Mexican revolution which began in 1910 and wound down by the 40's claimed over one million civilians murdered by both sides. Or, to be more accurate, by every side; since there were lots of armed bands of 'patriots' willing to shoot or torture whoever disagreed with them. Into this mayhem of chaos Greene sets a priest, the last in his province, who is fleeing incognito trying desperately to reach the border.  In a twist of irony, Greene's novel was privately condemned by The Vatican curia. (A public denunciation would have given him publicity. )   The curia's objection being that the priest is a sinner (Yeah --So?) Greene later recounted how he was summoned to Westminster where a very embarassed cardinal read him the letter of condemnation. Embarassed because he knew what it took some time for the curia to discover, that this is one of the greatest novels of the century.  Granted the &#34;Whiskey Priest&#34; as he is called, is hardly a heroic figure. His moniker comes from tipping the bottle much too frequently. He's also  fathered an illegitimate child who hates him, and whose love he wants more than anything in the world. He's a fairly nice, inoffensive guy who likes to do sleight of hand tricks to amuse his friends, enjoys prestige and creature comforts, &#34;The Whiskey Priest&#34; is a bit of a weakling and a coward. In other words, he could have gone out on double dates with St. Peter. . . And, likehis famous predecessor, because he is a priest, his office overwhelms all his weaknesses. After he makes his escape and  finds himself drifting into a respectable torpor, he meets a 'Judas' and thanks God that he must go back, even if it means his death.  A remarkable tale of reluctant heroism.	2003-06-30

There is none of the sacrifice, drama or nobility reported in battles. It's not about Thermopylae or Gettysburg.<br />This is an account of what humanity has done to itself--and continues to this day.  It's a book on comparitive demonology.  One almost gets the impression that a soldier ripping a baby from his mother's arms, tossing it in the air and catching it on the point of his bayonet is the rule, not the exception. Ditto for POW's captured by front line troops.<br />The author is a professor of Political Science who finds it amazing that his colleagues write texts on the purposes of government, yet fail to mention that (with the possible exception of the Jewish victims of Nazi genocide) instead of protecting citizens from \\"the savagery of the jungle\\" by rule of law, governments have and continue to be, THE greatest killers of all.<br />\\"Democide\\" is the word he coins to combine genocide (murdering because of membership in a hated race, ethnicity,or religion,)  plus politicide ( murdering for political purposes, e.g; dissidents ) and mass murder (indiscriminate killing).<br />Democide is always committed by governments. It is as organized as taxation or road building. Discounting  civilians accidentally killed in cross-fires, or even in the aerial bombardments of cities, this still leaves horrifying numbers.<br /> Pre-Twentieth Century? An estimate of 169,198,000 human beings massacred. Since this includes the victims of Genghis Khan, Incas, Conquistadors, etc., There's an obscene tendency to see them as not quite human, not quite real due to the distance in time. So Tarmelane, the Turkish conqueror slaughtered 100,000 people outside of Delhi and he liked to make pyramids of human heads?--Who cares?--Just stuff in history books. . . <br />Is WW2 is close enough? We all know about the 6 million Jews, but did you know that constituted only aprox 13% of the victims of The Nazi Genocide State? <br />Overall, by genocide, euthanasia, killing of hostages, reprisal raids, starvation, forced labor camps and so forth the figure is anywhere from 15 to 31 million, most likely 21 million. Rummel admits he may be off somewhat in numbers, but certainly not as to the State's intentions. The Nazis still head the list when it comes to killing people in occupied territories, with the Imperial Japanese Military being second. <br />As to murdering one's own people, it's estimated some 35,236,000 for the Communist Chinese Anthill. The author notes that those who were shocked by the 1989 Beijing massacre of students, really shouldn't have been--it's the norm. But even that figure is topped by 54,800,000 victims of The Soviet Gulag State. <br />(Not counting an additional 5-7 million comprised of German POW's plus non-combatants deliberately murdered by The Red Army).<br /> For sheer numbers, Stalin is our grand prize winner in brutality. In terms of percentage, however, the Khmer Rouge led by Pol Pot beats his insanity--they wiped out nearly one third of all Cambodians.<br />The chapter on The Vietnamese War State is most instructive, not just for the total toll of 1,670,000 victims but for the inferences Rummel draws: Before the U.S. entered the war, the Viet Minh were already as hardened a bunch of mass killers as the most disciplined SS units under Himmler.

And especially if you've ever wondered about the phenomenon of 'modern art.' <br />It's a great series of essays despite (or because of) Rand's prejudices--she was a strange combination of teenage ugly girl duckling sexual fantasies out of Danielle Steele combined with the mind of an Aristotle and the Romantic triumphalism of a Victor Hugo. <br />For all artists, and especially writers, ( Er. . .remember those tiny details like theme, plot, and character? ) this short work is outstanding.

This is one of them. Can't say authoritatively if it has anything to do with 'real Zen ' since I'm not, to my chagrin, the living Buddha, and apparently not one Zen master in a hundred claims to be 'enlightened' these days, at least not among the second generation bumper crop of American and European Zen masters-- A source of relief if you've ever read their vapid and banal pronouncements on life, death and the meaning of the universe. Guess they just don't make 'em like they used to in ancient China. Go sit. Nevertheless, Zen appealed to the young Western intelligensia via the writings of Suzuki, Watts and company. It's almost a religion tailor made for dashing bookworms (Is this a koan?) Here, R.H. Blyth gives the reader a, as Jung would say,  'mythological Zen'  that perhaps never was, but should have been, and he does so in an amazing book on English Lit.  So what's your attitude to life? The heroic as exemplified by Henley's  great poem &#34;Invictus&#34;? Or does the poetry of Tennyson hit closer to home?   &#34; But what am I?   An infant crying in the night:   An infant crying for the light:  And with no language but a cry. &#34;  Good points! But it's in the analysis of Hamlet as the archetypal 'zen-less' Western man that R.H really springs to life.  There are about as many critical interpretations of Shakespeare's prince as there are of Jesus, but R.H. has come up with one of the most outstanding.  Hamlet, THE greatest figure in tragedy since Sophocles, Aeschylus and Euripedes put ink to papyrus, suffers from 'Words, Words, Words'--for R.H. the clue to his (and our own ) malaise, as contrasted with the 'Zen-filled man ', the one and only Don Quixote de La Mancha ! R.H's study of Quixote--and Cervantes--is brilliant, though he modestly begs the reader's pardon for including the greatest of knights in a work of English, rather than Spanish literature.

The author of 'Practical Demonkeeping' and 'Blood Sucking Fiends: A love story',  now brings us The Gospel according to Biff, (Levi bar Alpheus, Christ's childhood pal) a hilarious yet  poignant and reverent account of the life of Jesus, from his birth to the begining of his ministry. <br />As that theological publication, Playboy magazine, noted of Christopher Moore: \\"If there's a funnier writer out there, step forward.\\"<br />BTW, in the 3rd century A.D. (or for those of you who are tragically hip, C.E.) there really was an \\"Infancy Gospel\\" attributed to St. Thomas,  in which J.C. was presented as an irrepresible 5 year old kid who made clay sparrows on the Sabbath (and turned them to real ones that flew away) cursed his teachers for being doofuses, and eventually learned to control his divine temper. The Church wisely decided that it was, at best, 'Apochryphal'.<br />Here, Biff is brought back to life by the angel Raziel to write his gospel in English, thus he is given the gift of tongues, which he notes is quite useful, as Hebrew not only had far fewer words, but a third were synonyms for guilt, anyway.<br />Biff and Raziel are holed up in a five star hotel. ( Biff notes that in his own days inns were measured by the number of harlots and is not quite sure how to make the conversion into stars )<br />Raziel, angel of the Lord, is on the side of Good, but he's not the brightest halo in the firmament. While he commands Biff to write, Raziel becomes completely engrossed with T.V. , especially soap operas and  professional wrestling---which he's convinced are real. \\"Soap Opera Digest\\"  obviously being a publication written by a prophet. <br />Biff notes \\"I understand there's a joke in your time about people with yellow hair being stupid--guess where it came from. \\"<br />The story involves Joshua trying to learn how to be The Messiah, and his travels with Biff to Afghanistan, China and India--in search of the wisdom of Balthasar, Gaspar and Melchior. The Three Wise Men--who recognized Josh's divinity at birth, but who have their own agendas. <br />Biff is protective of Josh, who, though the Son of God, has problems surviving on the road due to his being way too honest. <br />Besides he's not allowed to  'know women'. Which brings great side benefits for Biff--when the babes fall over themselves for Josh--- but doesn't help their chances of survival. <br />As Biff notes, the problem with his friend not knowing women is that he fails to understand the most basic truth about men; namely that we're lying pigs who will say anything to get what we want.<br />When Josh objects that Confucious (whom he has been studying under Balthasar's tutelage) says the Superior Man never acts contrary to virtue, Biff replies: \\"Of course, but the superior can get laid without lying, I'm talking about the rest of us!\\"<br />Balthasar's five nubile Chinese concubines couldn't agree more.<br />In addition to concubines, there are other wonders on their travels including a Yeti, a Kung-Fu Buddhist monastary where Josh develops a system of fighting that won't hurt anyone (Jew-Do, the way of the Jew), Bloodthirsty priests of Kali, an ancient text which Biff concientiously studies while Josh practises his Yoga (The Kama Sutra) The Turin Shroud, and an elephant they ride back to Galilee.<br />And then it gets even better . . .	2003-05-05

Answer: What would you like it to be changed into?  This is a sympathetic book towards neo-pagans. Ironically, because Hutton  does not buy the party line of a pre-historic,  nature religion whose tecahings have survived in an unbroken line through family clans, it's not popular with advocates of the matriarchal apostolic succession. In other words, pop Wicca 101 writers hate his guts.   A Wicca, in case you haven't got a copy of the Oxford English Dictionary handy is a 'male witch' , as contrasted with Wicce, a female.  However if you've changed your name to Snowflake, Blackjack-for-my-Tribe ( or some other Native American or Celtic?) Well, you might have been told it was the other way around. Plus Wicca is re-defined as someone who practises the 'Craft of the Wise', and to Hades with linguistic analysis. Who do these scholars think they are, anyway?   Native American names are popular, since they had a splendid history of women's rights. Celtic ones are also cool, since the Druids were an all male priesthood who, like the Aztecs, practised human sacrifice , but c'mon, those redheaded Irish babes were hot!  All Praise to Brigid!  Wiccans or Witches are NOT--as they never tire of pointing out to the public--Satanists.  Which of course makes absolutely no difference to the majority of Jews, Christians or Muslims, let alone fundamentalist ones; but I imagine it must be a source of great relief to Satanists, who consider Wiccans fluffy, neo-pagans, with atrocious taste in poetry. Hate to to say it, but they've got a point.  (  &#34;The Charge of the Goddess&#34;, is a case in point, being a derivative of Crowley's &#34;Hymn to Nuit.&#34;  )  Hutton suggests Wiccans would be better of with the lunar poetry of Shelley, Keats, Graves and other romantics.   I hope I'm not making it sound like  Hutton is ridiculing anyone's religion. He's not.  He's an old school Brit and goes out of his way to be cordial. It's just that the man IS a historian, so faced with some of the more bizarre claims of 'Traditional Wiccans' his polite response may sound to some hard core believers as if he's punching out the Tooth Fairy in front of a kindergarten class.  For example, take the question of how a pagan polytheistic religion, whether invented or re-discovered in England by the likes of Gardner, Sanders, Dion Fortune and company--who were politically somehere to the monarchical right of Attila The Hun, cross over to the USA and become an evangelical, feminist, ecolological and de facto monotheistic (THE Goddess ) religion?  It's a fascinating historical tour de force by Hutton, a mystery story that weaves the threads of archeology from Sir Arthur Evans in Crete to Mariaja Gimbutas in Anatolia; combining the longings of 19th century Romantic writers--Charlotte Bronte included--to the celebration of Yule and other worldwide nature rites; then the jump to the &#34;Burning Times&#34;--a wildly revitionist view of the witch trials in Europe.  Perhaps the best defense for a belief in a worlwide Lady and Lord of the Woods pre-historical religion ( I hope we all saw the 1973 version of 'The Wicker Man') comes from the craving of the soul:  In a short story by Lovecraft, whose name I can't remember--a man brings a supposedly ancient vase to an archeologist who informs him that it's a fraud---no more than a hundred years old. The man counters by telling him that it's even more recent: he painted it himself last night, but the image came to him in a dream, and dreams are older than mankind. Hutton borders on the same point. As Robert Graves observed, though nominally The West is Christian, in actuality, most of us live as if we were ruled by what he called the 'unholy trimverate' of Pluto, god of wealth, Apollo, god of science and Mercury, god of thieves.

The question is whether the most colorful of Freud's \\"heir apparents\\" actually discovered something of vital importance before going nuts. <br />Colin Wilson argues that he did.  Reich followed the 'scientific method' to the letter, starting with experiments involving microbes and working up to UFO's. <br />Skeptics argue that his cultures must have been contaminated, and that time lapse photography showing stars moving but unknown objects standing still during the night are inconclusive. <BR> <BR>But the hidden argument is that one shouldn't trust a madman, no matter what his methodology may be. Which is rather beside the point, especially when Reich was not alone. Others  corroborated his results. Were they deluding themselves as well?<br />Wilhelm Reich had an atypical childhood. As a teenager he caught his mother having an affair and, after a delay which might have involved an attempt to sexually blackmail her, he finally informed his father. His mother committed suicide. Hardly a promising beginning for a psychotherapist.<br />Yet he rose from the ranks by his genius to become Freud's number one apostle, a post 'vacated' by Jung. <br /> Freud was pained by reductionist charges ('Is there ANY mental illness that doesn't involve repressed sex, herr doctor? ) and  documented clinical cases to justify his arguments to  his critics. He demanded and expected all of his followers to back him up.<br /> Reich backed him up with a vengeance, he became even more of a reductionist than Freud---in itself no mean feat! But he added a strange spin, which to Reich seemed the next logical step of Freud's sexual theory.<br />Colin Wilson recounts that Freud was essentially a classical pessimist. He believed human beings were the playthings of the gods and  fates ( re-named the 'ID' and the 'Death Wish'). On the other hand, Reich was a romantic optimist who believed thatthe libido had supreme healing power.<br />He was a throwback to Bergson's 'Life Force' and Mesmer's 'Animal Magnetism'. <BR>With Reich, orgasms not only cured everything from neurosis to warts, they produced \\"Orgone Energy\\" the vital building block of life in the universe!<br />...P> <BR>An enjoyable and illuminating biography that credits Reich for advances in psychology, especially his discovery of 'Character Armor' <br />Wilson documents many cases in which half an hour of Reichian therapy produced better result than months of classical psychoanalysis.<br />Perhaps someone, somewhere should submit his more outlandish claims to crtical study? <br />Is there a scientist in the house?	2003-03-30

In one memorably ruined production this was the director's obsession, so he gave the actor playing Lear tiny, birdlike movements. <br />Alas! The set designer strongly disagreed and burst forth with a magnificently bare stage relieved only by a giant phallic monument at the center.<br />His vision being that King Lear was: \\"A Man Lost in a Wilderness. \\" <br /> They never did reach an agreement. <br />But, as Green points out, it really wouldn't have mattered, because if one is brilliant enough to be obsessed about Lear being 'A Man Trapped In a Tube', neither Shakespeare, the cast, nor the audience has much of a fighting chance. . .<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />This book is a deliciously hilarious spoof of the British stage, with heavy emphasis on 'cultural' amateur societies. It is a satire on producing as well as acting, directing,--and the gurus who teach it.<br />But in a wonderful twist of irony, it is now required reading with many Theater Arts depatrments in universities around the world.<br />( \\"Do NOT go to acting school!\\"--- Eleonora Duse )<br />As well it should be. Filled with outrageously improbable anecdotes , it nevertheless hits home too well for anyone in the profession. <br /> It is a true masterpiece of ham, which offers marvelous advice for directors on how to succeed through obscurantist doublespeak. <br /> No director, for example, should EVER say anything that remotely sounds 'practical' such as : \\"Well, frankly, I have to get 'em to speak up. \\" <br /> Far, far better, according to Green, is to say things that sound profound but mean nothing, such as : \\"I'm not interested at all whether the audience hears my actors, but---it is vital they should hear them thinking. \\"<br />Heavy . . .<br />( \\"If a director writes in his notes: 'The Oedipal complex is obvious in this scene, must discuss with the queen'; the sooner he is packed and thrown out of the theater, the better it'll be for everyone! \\"-- George Bernard Shaw )<br /> Shaw has an ally in Green who, based on personal experience, is convinced that the director's primary job is to weed out the obvious psychotics in the cast during the first week of rehersals.<br />As to actors left on board Green believes he is far more practical than Stanislavsky, whom he does not admire on the grounds that 'these method people are so vague.' He advises actors should carry a chart (1. Speak Slower. 2. Speak Faster, etc.) for whenever the director goes off into interpretive raptures, Oedipal or not. <br />Simply ask him to point to which number he wants. <br /> Ah! And who could possibly forget the classic: \\"How To Steal a Scene Though Unconscious\\" which puts anything ever written by Constantin to shame. . .<br />An very, very funny book, which suprisingly does contain unexpected gems of commonsense.<br />Five stars are not enough.	2003-03-08

Aleister Crowley(1875-1947) recounts his life and the pride he took in being a genius (he had memorized The Bible before he was seven), a poet, an adventurer, a world renowned mountain climber, a blindfold chess master, a lover, a sorcerer, and The Chosen Prophet of the Ancient Gods of Egypt!  But, above all: an English Gentleman.  Unfortunately his compatriots, like queen Victoria on a celebrated occasion, were not amused. The newspapers depicted him as a satanic, devil worshipping maniac. A charge which was  somewhat unfounded and rather ironic since this was the man that satanic devil worshipping maniacs were too scared to mess with.  He was a passionate artist with a flair for danger, an extreme of the spiritual and the sensual, a cross between between  St. John of the Cross and the Marquis de Sade.  Only Rasputin could match him as a true historical figure that seems too improbable to have existed. Neither man would be 'believable', even in lurid work of fictional melodrama.  Yet they lived.  And A.C. topped Rasputin in possesing  (or being possed by) a savagely sarcastic sense of humor which took no prisoners. Say what you will of him  but one must grant him a remarkable talent for making enemies everywhere.  W.B. Yeats wanted him expelled from The Golden Dawn (The most influential Rosicrucian/Freemasonic lodge of the 19th century) on the grounds that 'a mystical society should not have to serve as a reform school for juvenile delinquents.' For his part, The  Magus informs us that Yeats was full of black, bilious rage, because he, Crowley was by far the greater poet.  He once remarked that it was  interesting that such a small county as Stratford had given England her two greatest poets, for one must not forget Shakespeare . . .   A.C.  founded his own temple of 'life, love, and liberty' after his wife had a vision while visiting  a museum in Cairo. The year was 1904 and the gods were ready to annoint an English Gentleman to bear forth their message to humanity and usher in a new era which would replace Christianity, as Christianity had replaced the crumbling faiths of the Roman Empire.  Thus  'The Book of the Law' came to be written (or dictated?) Its main tenet was &#34;Do What Thou Wilt.' Apparently Isis or Horus were fans of the novels of Rabelais, since that was the motto inscribed in his fictional abbey. And, in all likelihood Rabelais probably got it from St. Augustine's maxim: &#34;Love, and do what you will&#34;. And if you can name which Greek philosopher thought it up first, treat yourself a trip to Cairo and listen closely to your inner voice. . .  It would hardly be surprising to be told that AC was reared in an ultra-fundamentalist Christian sect and thus, he rebelled with  vengeance.   What is surprising is that the quest for 'The Holy Grail' never left him, even as he climbed the Himalayas, seduced countesses, hobnobbed with Rodin, and made life quite interesting for anyone around him. A fascinating look at a strange man and his times recounted with humor, sorrow and faith.	2002-10-25

And their princely offspring are generally inclined to be either half-witted or even more vicious.<br />No matter how much history may have romanticized Themistocles, Pericles, Socrates, and the rest of the boys in the previous 'golden age,' the Hellenic period is such a fall from grace that the reader can hardly wait for a sane and efficiently corrupt Rome to wipe them out in the final chapters. <br />Green's style may be too breezy and ironic for some readers who prefer their scholarly works dry. <br />As an example, Green mentions that Cleopatra  respected Caesar while Mark Antony \\"nearly drove her nuts.\\" <br />Above all, it's in the area of philosophy that Green show his most original or, to some, annoyingly cute writing.  <br />Philosophy, far from  being a rarified persuit of academics, is the central spirit of the culture and times. And the times were tough. <br />This is why Cynics, who would normally be considered parasites or simply nuts, flourished and why Skeptics often brought men toward rather than away from religion. After all, if nothing can be proven with certainty, why not gofor the afterlife with gusto?<br />For those of us who are inclined to think of Stoics as heroes or of Epicureans as noble, Green rounds out the portrait unflatteringly.<br /> Epicurus was, according to Green, a cult leader who was able to live placidly in his 'garden' thanks to the generous donations of rich dilettantes.  Working for a living does not enter into his philosophy. A dogmatist who shunned debate and anathematized all 'heretics' in his polemics, he was probably suffering from bulemia. Hence, his constant emphasis on avoiding pain as the greatest of virtues. <br />In this 'monastic life' his followers engaged in friendly conversation trying to convince themselves that all careers were uselesss and death was not such a big deal.<br />Stoicism also takes a beating. We're told it was a pop philosophy, logically suspect in its premises, a consolation for a once free people who were now politically powerless. <br /> Stoics became vastly more influential than Epicureans, not because their message was more profound than, 'Gather your rosebuds while ye may,' but because it provided a cosmological support to astrology, an increasingly popular fad among the powerless as well as an incentive to the ambitious that they were fulfilling the destiny of the living universe as they strove for their goals by hook or by crook.<br /> Therefore, it could be all things to all people, producing such unlikely bedfellows as Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and Seneca.<br /> Bottom line? For anyone intersted in the Hellenic period, this is THE book.	2002-09-08

What's wrong with this picture?<br /><br />1) A CIA  officer in Lebanon strikes gold : He discovers a safe house for Abu Nidal, one of the top terrorist organizations which is  interconnected with practically every other.  He prepares to rent an apartment next door, bring a tech team, stick a mike in the wall and bug their meetings. His name is Robert Baer. Baer is outraged that the US embassy in Beirut has been bombed and no one seems close to a solution as to who did it or where they may strike again.<br /><br /> His chief, a confirmed desk jockey, vetoes the operation on the grounds that it might upset the  Lebanese government if they found out.  He suggests Baer should finagle an invitation to attend an Australian embassy party instead.  When Baer replies \\"Who the hell do you expect is going to show up at an Australian embassy reception?\\" he is met with silence.<br /><br />2) Former KGB archivist, Vasili Mitrokhin gets turned away by the CIA on the grounds that Russia is now a friendly country.<br /><br /> This, despite the resurgence of Russian nationalism, possibly missing nuclear bombs, and the exposure of traitors Aldich Ames (CIA) and  Robert Hanssen (FBI).<br /><br /> This story, at least, has a happy ending. Vasili subsequently volunteered to British intelligence and the info provided culminated in the arrest of dozens of spies, including a U.S. colonel.<br /><br />3) In 1995 Baer runs an 'office' in the hills of Kurd occupied northern Iraq. Opposition leaders and Iraqi generals join forces in a coup d'etat against Saddam Hussein.  The plan involves precise timing. As the US representative they give Baer all the details and ask if they have US cooperation.  Baer reports all to his superiors stateside. He assures them Washington wants to get rid of Saddam.<br /><br /> The preliminary attack to divert Saddam's attention begins as scheduled. At this eleventh hour, Baer gets a telegram from HQ that the US is backing off and the Kurds and Iraqi generals are ontheir own. One of them ironically asks if they have never heard of the Bay of Pigs.<br /><br />4) President Aliyev of Azerbijan informs  Baer and other American 'delegates' that he is ready to help but that the US must \\"live up to its bargains\\".<br /><br />The 'delegation' has no idea what he's talking about so Aliyev explains that the State Dept undersecretary and  Deputy Energy secretary  promised him help against Iran and threatened  'bad relations' with the US if Aliyev did not give a contract to Exxon---never mind competing American oil companies, or free market ideals---According to Baer, Clinton was \\"pimping for Exxon\\".<br /><br /> He  reports on widespread corruption in Washington  when it came to oil deals with former USSR republics. He names names and recounts how his offers to testify before Congress met with--you guessed it--silence.<br />-----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />See No Evil is the story of Rober Baer, a self admitted ski bum who applied for a job at the CIA in his early twenties as a lark, not really thinking he'd be hired but hoping that if he were, he'd be able to get a paycheck while fooling around Switzerland's mountaintops.<br /><br />No such luck. It turned out to be hard and dangerous work. However, he discovered he had a taste for being a field officer--rather like a cop who enjoys working the streets. He worked the streets for 21 years and recounts it in this best selling book.<br /><br />Baer's main beef is that the US intelligence community is enamored of the \\"eye in the sky\\"--satellite photos and high tech gizmos which  cannot tell what goes on inside the human mind. For that one needs field officers and infiltrators, which the increasingly PC establishment was unwilling to keep backing  Consequently they became dinosaurs.<br /><br />Baer's  critics seem to charge him with wanting to dismantle the NSC, or down all American satellites and sell them for scrap. Rather absurd charges that side step the issues.<br /><br />Great reading before we all become dinosaurs.	2002-08-30

The Bobo (Bourgeois/Bohemian) are baby boomers and middle aged yuppies who made good in college, embraced corporate America and are now the new ruling class of educated elites.<br />A class defined by pretensions of artistic sensibilities, left wing politics and a penchant for constant self improvement. Consequently Bobos do not enjoy orgasm, they achieve it, rather like getting an A in algebra thanks to the right tutor. Lady Chatterly's lover has become Lady Chatterly's 'empowerment counselor'.<br /><br />In formerly exclusive Bohemian fields borgeois etiquette and mainstream acceptance are now the new standards. Sadomasochistic groups which less enlightened souls would have termed perverts during the stone age of pre-Bobo American society nowdays respectfully refer to themselves as 'the leather community ' and host charity drives.<br />As Mr. Brooks observes, self-respect is a laudable goal to attain while one is tied naked to the floor worshipping a dominatrix wearing leather boots.<br /><br />Bobo theology is somewhat reminiscent of the church of the month club. So tolerant and vague Unitarians are put to shame. Brooks believes The last Judgement will be replaced with The last Discussion group in which the damned will be separated from those who re-cycle.<br /><br />Even the legendary orgiastic two fisted parties of disenfrachised artists have crumbled before the onslaught. Bobo parties sin against Dionysus. Two white wines at most and it's time to go home to the kids. In the past the Bohemians raised hell, but now that CEO's have delusions of quirky artistry and all corporate work is 'creative' parties are sedate affairs to chit chat about your vacation in Nepal, or better yet, Vietnam. No one needs to let off steam, just lay back and talk about the latest offerings on N.P.R.<br />The Clintons, according to Brooks, are the quitessential Bobos, hip anti war protestors of the 60's and futures traders in the 80's.<br /><br />As to Bobo child rearing, Brooks likesto contrast Tom Sawyer with today's PBS kids. Tom was beaten by kindly Aunt Polly into acquiring table manners and attending school but was otherwise left free to adventure and wander. The children of Bobos are never spanked, but according to the author they are more enslaved than they were in the Victorian era. They are shepparded from one adult sponsored event to another.  Adventure and wander? You must be kidding! All games and activities must be edifying, as the specter of SAT tests loom around the corner.<br /><br /> Above all, it's in the art of  unconspicous consumption that Bobos truly show their mettle. A diamond necklace is declasse and mansions are gaudy, but what could possibly be wrong in spending $25,000 on a shower stall? Or designing a kitchen that looks like an airport hangar?<br />If it's a 'tool', the sky's the limit in spending. Hence we have Sports Utility (a contradiction in terms) Vehicles and R.E.I. sweaters and ponchos that cost an arm and a leg. Never mind that the SUV will hardly ever be taken off road, nor that 99% of the R.E.I. consumers will ever hike a glacier. The gear is cool.<br /><br />Bobos in Paradise is a  very witty book and worth the reading though the author is careful not to cut too deep.<br /> In the first place, Mr. Brooks errs in assigning Bobos the title of the new upper class.  They're not. Despite all their money, they're middle class to the core.<br /><br /> And Mr. Brooks, a self admitted Bobo himself, attempts too hard to defend their contributions to American culture.<br /><br />True, hippies produced the lava lamp and Bobos produced Martha Stewart. And while we should let history decide which is the greater cultural atrocity, we should not to forget Mort Sahl's definition of yuppies as that detestable generation whose idea of courage is to eat at a restaurant that has not yet been reviewed.	2002-08-17

One was to  simply dislike it and the other was to like Pope.<br />Pericles did not do well with the 18th century pundits because it deviates from the 'Aristotelian unities'. Unlike The Tempest, for example,  which takes place in one locale over a couple of days, Pericles takes place 15 years all over the ancient Mediterranean. It has the form of an epic. What can I say?  Homer would have dug it.<br />It's the story of a prince who screws up. Partly from his fault, mostly not. It's got tyrants, incest, treason, murder, knights, wizards, teenagers, kings, pirates, brothels, young love, a great hero and The Goddess Diana.<br />Oh yeah, the poetry's not too shabby either.<br />The theme is what to do when  everything goes horribly wrong. How to weather sorrow and get through your life. How to be honorable and not give in to despair.<br />Someone once remarked that the romances are tragedies turned upside down e.g; The Winter's Tale begins as Othello and then has a happy ending.  At least if it's performed by a good cast who commits to the miracle of the statue coming back to life.<br />If they 'apologize' for an outlandish miracle, it's doomed. Likewise, Pericles also has a happy ending  if it's produced by a company who loves the play  rather than by a group who views it as a rare curiosity in the Shakespeare canon.<br /> It might interest some readers to know that the nonsense about Shakespeare only writing part of it is, God help us, a compromise position from  a few scholars who don't want to get into an argument with unorthodox loons about who really wrote Shakespeare's plays.<br />Pericles was left out of the first folio. For that matter so were 100 lines of King Lear and there's 300 lines that appear in the folio version of Lear that aren't in the quarto (having fun yet?) which, of course, is positive proof that de Vere or Queen Elizabeth or Bacon or Lope de Vega was really the true writer and never mind that while William Shakespeare lived and for 200 years later no one thought to question his authorship, what did those Elizabethans know , anyway?<br />Besides he never went to college, so there.<br /><br />(sigh)<br /><br />As  James Barrie, the author of Peter Pan once remarked:  I do not know if Francis Bacon wrote Shakespeare' plays, but if he didn't he missed the opportunity of a lifetime.<br /><br />In the hands of the right director, Pericles, Prince of Tyre is truly great.	2002-08-05
US	49532061	RIZXZ17T6OPDA	1574882856	329455826	The Forgotten Soldier	Books	4	12	19	N	N	Maybe your life isn't so bad after all. . .	At least you're not freezing AND starving, you're not trapped and surrounded by the Red Army, armed partisans are not out to mutilate you, the girl you love back home is not being bombed and your life and those of your friends does not hang on the military whim of a mad corporal named Hitler.  Whew! And those are only a few of the nightmares that Guy Sajer had to endure for years on the Eastern Front. Some critics have doubted the author's veracity based on small details regarding troop i.d. numbers and the like, which they argue  would have been unavailable to a common soldier. My feeling is that the real objection is that the book is just too well written! Sajer does work up his facts with some literary flair. e.g.; we do not find out the name of 'the veteran' until half way through.  (Why is it that only boring, impersonal writing is considered credible?) This is probably one of the best first person accounts of the terror and pain of war ever written. Despite some omissions (As usual, with German war memoirs, there is not a single anti-Semite or Nazi in the entire Wehrmacht) the author does clarify some issues which have not been written about before as when his benevolently wise C.O. gives the troops a pep talk as to why they're fighting which is straight out of Nietzche. There is also Sajer's own ambivalence. He did not have to fight at all. He was the son of a French father and a German mother living in the 'Germanic region' of occupied France. But being a teenager, he thought it would be cool to be a Stuka pilot, or failing that, at least to be accepted into the camaraderie of the elite Grossdeutschland corp.  I mean what kid doesn't want to be in the 'Special Forces'? The book could be subtitled 'the horrors of a dumb teenager in love with the romance of war' Reality intervenes brutally and Sajer masterfully recounts his three years at the front with a stunning imagery which gives this book its haunting power. It is impossible to pick which episode is mostmoving or disturbing: Getting a letter from his mother telling him not to volunteer for anything dangerous--while artillery shells are falling all around him. His leave and budding love affair in Berlin interrupted by a massive air bombardment. The bloody night retreat from Kiev in makeshift boats. Coming home at last and having his own mother not recognize him. Page after page Sajer takes the reader into a vivid inescapable world of madness from which there is no escape and no one to rely upon except the other poor sods stuck in a mudhole beside him who have become more than his family or country. They are his entire universe. His reason for living and the source of his courage.	2002-06-27

India in a crazy, dangerous and very funny search for \\"Insider Information\\" as ordered by Master Feroze.<br />This supreme artist being an elegant, distinguished older gentleman and somewhat sadistic taskmaster who tolerates nothing short of excellence from his apprentice when it comes to observation, methodical reasoning, (Mycroft and Sherlock could have gotten pointers from Feroze), fencing, cooking--He's a cordon blue chef as well as a mean hand with the foil--poetry, showmanship, or anything else that will serve his art: Sorcery.<br /> How on earth did the author get himself in this fix? <br />Well, it all started back in England when an unexpected Pushtan shows up at the doorstep of Tahir Shah's aristocratic and ever so polite parents. The Pushtan has been warned in a dream that the young child is in mortal danger and has come all the way from India, where he guards the tomb of Shah's ancestor--as his father did before him, of course--to save young Tahir from Shaitan's clutches!<br />The author recalls this boyhood misadventure and his discovery of the Pushtan's hobby, magic. A hobby no child could resist. Tahir pleads to be his assistant and together they put on a morning's entertainment for the family. <br /> This consisted in the young boy swallowing broken glass before his horrified father and a miscalculated--they should have used less powder--explosion. <br />(Now, don't try this at home, boys and girls.)<br />To the relief of the family, after the Pushtan seriously convinces himself that he's saved Tahir's life he graciously exits back to India. . .<br />Fast forward to Tahir Shah in his 20's having a bull session with his mates. They're all moving away from home, getting their own flats in London and prepping for careers in business. And what profession will you follow, Tahir?<br />In an inspired moment of lunacy he announces a preposterous adventure: He will go to India, track down the Pushtan'slegendary teacher, the great Feroze, and become his student! Why settle for a boring job when you can be a master magician?<br />The author gets more than he bargained for and the winner is the reader. Fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ride. <BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />BTW it might interest you to know that there are approximately 5,000 \\"godmen\\" in India- gurus who claim to be the incarnation of some diety or other but who are really devotees of The High One-- Feroze's hero---the incomperable Erich Weiss. <br />Prominent among the joys of this book are vivid accounts of the 'miracles' the author encounters. The duel between a holy(?) man and woman out miracling each other for the favors of the awestruck crowd. The blooming flowers that 'bow' when another godman makes his entrance among throngs of his faithful. The bank manager who had to quit his job because he wasn't inspiring confidence in  depositors when they saw him literally crawl before a clerks's desk, (The  lowly clerk being, of course, a living incarnation of  God.)---We are truly through the looking glass. Though the reader is unsure whether to laugh or weep for India.<br />Feroze himself appears philosophically resigned towards the 'godmen'. Well, why not? After all, many were former pupils . . .<br /> He observes that Indians look to their 'godmen' for medical healings or financial improvement, whereas Westeners look to them for praise in order to enhance their self-esteem. <BR>(Anyone care to stroll on some hot coals?)<br />According to Feroze, the 'godmen' have enormous political power. He comments that outside of India only Uri Geller has come close but his influence is minimal compared to the subcontinent where even Prime Ministers have become devotees to the spiritual grandchildren of Erich Weiss. . .<br />(a.k.a.

Discipline wins over individual courage, despite Homer's enthralling duels between champions, a concept which the rational Greeks soon discovered; along with the concept of reason itself which is why The West Has Won.<br /><br />Hanson believes that the Apache braves, murderously effective in surprise raids, would have lasted about half an hour at Gettysburg. At the battle of Poitiers the average Frank lumbered into battle with aprox 70 lbs of armor and arms, making him easy pickings for the light Muslim cavalry--had he broken ranks.<br /><br />(In which case we'd all be debating whether The Koran should be read in public school, but that's another story)<br /><br />Discipline and the determination to hold the ground, then an advance en masse wiped out the Saracens.<br /><br />Hanson asserts discipline is even more important than terrain or numbers.--In all three of Alexander's decisive battles against the Persians, enemy forces chose the ground, not him. Still, Alexander was overjoyed that he would get to fight a pitched battle with his smaller army, rather than to have to continue to chase Darius.<br /><br /> At Gaugamela , when Alexander's left wing was about to break, the Persians decided that looting the camp was easier than fighting the Greek rear, thus giving Alexander time to break through their lines and massacre the bunch. Again, discipline carried the day.<br /><br />Hanson believes that the free 'farmer-citizen' will be superior to a mercenary. A logical point which he does belabor at times to emphasize his thesis. And despite loopholes in his arguments-<br /><br />(Were the Japanese freer than the Persian troops thus accounting for their very 'Western' resistance in the atolls of The Pacific against the USMC? Or were they equally servile<br />as the Persians during the battle at Midway, thus resulting in their defeat?)<br /><br />-Nevertheless, the preponderance of evidence weighs in his favor.<br /><br />Hanson seems a bit ambivalent about the 'great man theory' (the military genius commander)Although it would seem to fit in well with the Western concept of individualism. Perhaps because Hannibal was a 'great man' and the Romans made mincemeat of the Phoenician state despite the 'great man's' initial stunning victory at Cannae.<br /><br />The Romans were decidedly 'Western' in their approach to war.<br /><br />As to the 'guns and germs' counterargument as the primary reason for the success of The West, Hanson points out that the Spaniards sent out an expedition to Florida shortly after Cortes's victory which, despite its superior technology, got itself killed very dead indeed--the commander was no Cortes.<br /><br />Incidentally, the chapter on Hernando Cortes is one of the most informative in this book; principally because of the misconceptions that it clears. No, the Aztecs did NOT believe the Spaniards were gods after the first couple of weeks after thy landed, and yes, though the Aztecs died in large numbers by smallpox, this was more than balanced by the bronchial ailments that plagued the tiny expeditionary force.<br />H.C. was a military genius.<br /><br />As to the Tet offensive, Hanson rightly calls attention to the fact that it was a major victory for the American side despite the failure in intelligence to warn the troops, but an ultimate loss due to what he believes to be the 'criticism inherent in a free society.'<br /><br /> Is this a contradiction? He criticizes the conduct of the Vietnam war more vehemently than any leftist( though admittedly on strategic ideals) i.e; we should have invaded the North; winning hearts and minds is the goal of a missionary, not soldiers, and what kind of madness is it when there is no ground to hold or win, anyway?<br /><br /> Hanson should have concluded that the war was badly led from his own arguments.<br /><br /> Or, if one grants  that a 'Western' type of conflict was untenable in Indochina we should have stuck with SOG/ Apaches to lead small anti insurgent forces.<br /><br />As to the future, the author concludes that the armies of the USA and Europe are now, de facto 'mercenary'--no more free citizen farmers--but lower class kids trying to work their way up in society.<br /><br />He's concerned as to whether the West will have the will to remain 'Western'--could we, as the Romans did after Cannae, muster up the resolve and manpower for 'shock battle' and decisive engagements which lead to unconditional defeat of the enemy?<br /><br />The reader might recall that after the bombings of American embassies then President Clinton ordered an attack by cruise missiles  on one of Osama's base in Afghanistan--for all the good it did us.<br /><br />It was 'Western' only as far as technology (which Hanson argues is not enough). It was decidedly 'foreign' according to all the principles that this book articulates to be the backbone of Western warfare.<br /><br />Good reading.	2002-03-06

Repeat with Othello,  etc.<br />See how easy it is?  Now do it.<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />To say Kinski was talented, or that he lived on the edge, or that he was a bit too intense for his friends or wives is, of course, an understatement.  Nor did fame and money do much to quench the anger or appetite of this outcast.<br /> One of his wives, as she entered the hospital to deliver their child, wondered why all the prostitutes on the street waved at them and seemed so friendly.  Herzog, despite plotting Kinsi's murder, kept using him as his leading man. <br />Yet the greatest tribute may be not Herzog's but the fact that, during his lifetime many  fellow actors spoke about how kind Kinski was to work with--a true  accolade to a narcissistic egomaniac who apparently never lost his humanity by the expedient method of never being able to stop being hurt by life. <br />As he put it, he never allowed his wounds to fully close. Though the reader might conclude that he was unable to have his wounds close, no matter how much he tried.<br />Speaking of method, Kinski slams 'method acting' in this book:<BR>'These morons go into a sort of St. Vitus dance as an exercise before performing' and 'What is this idiocy? As if a school could teach me how to feel'<br />Less credible is his slamming of Herzog: 'A megalomaniac' and 'I kicked him... Herzog groveled'  Especially when one considers that his most memorable performances were in Herzog's films.<br />Kinski opens his autobiography with a quote from one of his idols, Van Gogh. Too lengthy to repeat here but the essence of it being that all artists are cripples trying  clumsily to express what was  expressed only once-- by Jesus Christ. <br />Unsurprisingly, Kinski also toured Europe late in his life, reading from the gospels and insulting some audience members who did not share his view of Jesus as a criminal hunted down by society, while hugging others who shared his 'outcast' faith.<br />Kinski also wondered if he was the reincarnation of Paganini, arguably the most proficient techniqual violinist of all time, and, of course, an intense womanizer. <br />Kinski did not spend much time doubting his sanity, it seems he considered it a rather futile endeavor in a world where it was self evident that everybody was mad. <br />However, neither did he glamorize lunacy as a standard, there is nothing romantically sophomoric in his descriptions of being held in an insane assylum for a couple of weeks. It's more vivid and horrific than his description of being held in a POW camp for years.  <br />He made certain he would not be be incarcerated for alleged (?) madness again, just as-- despite his extravagant lifestyle--he also made certain he would not suffer starvation again, as he did in his childhood.<br />For all actors or artists one plain piece of advice: Get this book. Despite exaggerations (or downrigth lies) this is a superb testimony by one of the greatest of all time.	2002-02-26

Well, if you have faith in it. . .<br /><br />The progression (some would say the degeneration) of Stanislavski in the US goes something like this: Charles Conrad (who taught for Meisner and never wrote anything, his is the Zen-style of Stanislavski) to Sandford Meisner (who taught for Strasberg and wrote an unintelligible book but who is much admired for getting method actors off their introspective derrieres and on their feet) Lee Strasberg who, unlike Stella Adler never met The Master himself, so felt free to um.. theorize even further, and Michael Checkhov, (the only great actor of the bunch who Stan considered his best student even though he rejected the system) whose mystical ideas are floating somewhere in the stratosphere . . .<br /><br />Strasberg, by far the most influential, founded Method Acting.<br /><br /> (Not to be confused with the Stanislavski System or 'The Method of Physical Action '- a short treatise in &#34;Creating a Role.&#34; )<br /><br /> Method emphasized remembered memory a.k.a. emotional memory which at times superseded the objective by demanding a Pavlovian type of identification/ connection which would ensure real tears.<br /><br />In a way he set theater back to before 'finding the brooch'<br /><br /> Later, Stanislavski himself rejected the emotional memory/pavlovian experiment after many of his actors started freaking out.<br /><br />The main moral of an Actor Prepares is that if you're going to write a world changing treatise on acting, it helps if you've got a genius playwright like Michael's uncle whose plays you can produce.<br /><br />The second is to play the--oops said that already.<br /><br />May I also humbly recommend  Mike Green's 'The Art of Coarse Acting'  Shurtleff's 'Audition' Keith Johnstone's 'Impro' and Klaus Kinski's bio, for a sense of, if not sanity, at least a healthy dose of skeptical heresy?	2002-02-22

This autobiography is a joy to read.<br />Usually books from physicists suffer in their attempt to make the language of mathematics understandable to the public by means of analogies that confuse the issues even more. <br />This book will not confuse the layman. But it'll befuddle anyone lacking in a sense of humor. <br />Perhaps the most important question it poses is what constitutes genius? Or a man of genius? How does a brilliant mathematician go around taking wild leaps in logic and landing on his feet?<br />Apparently having a soul, a sense for the absurd, and a taste for babes really helps. <br />That's an interesting counter to all the 'self evident' sermonizing about genius being 99% hard work , the capacity for taking infinite pains, etc, etc.<br />Of course, one could argue that learning to pick up and score with women in one night by means of letting THEM buy YOU drinks or hanging out with the Nick the Greek in Las Vegas to fathom how he made a fortune in spite of the house odds IS very hard and painstaking work.<br /> What can one say? Feynman had a blast. So will the reader.	2002-01-31

I loved this autobiography; one really comes to like and admire Beverly (hard to imagine not being on a first name basis with her by the book's end ) both for the courage in pouring her heart out and the witty charm of her writing style. A rare combination indeed.<br />For Protestants who believe that Mary equals idolatry, do not worry, sometimes whole weeks go by and we Catholics do not see a statue of Mary weeping tears of blood at our local parish. <br />Besides, this narrative is unlikely to make it into a Catholic Book of the Month Club (Is there such a thing?) what with Beverly deliberately writing that she hoped Jesus and Mary Magdalene got it on, that she couldn't bring herself to see J.P # 2 despite being granted a Papal audience because his stance on birth control and women in general is barbarically primitive; and that she loves worshipping (she knows damn well the party line is 'venerating') The Blessed Virgin Mary--or as Beverly refers to her, the B.V.M.<br />What we've got here is a repentant Christian, who is brought back to the Church, in spite of herself, through the Grace of The B.V.M.--who is frankly aware of the absurdity of her condition and yet tremendously grateful. <br /> As for the travelogue, Beverly takes us to the spiritual heights of Medjurgoje; where seeing the sun spin out of orbit or having  silver medals  that turn into gold is commonplace enough to be blase, to the abyss of whitebread West Los Angeles, California, where a young priest beams at the congregation while recounting how much he likes to rollerblade (Like, groovy, dude!) <br />In the end, our heroine finds a home, liturgy and peace in Mexico. But the travels are only part of the panorama of sinners, saints, zealots, bigots, and other assorted lunatics which make up The Church (and this book.)<br />The redemption of Beverly is a bittersweet story. Hardest to take is her self-flagellation at not having been a good mother to her son, Jason,---who must be pushing 30 and soundslike he's turned out really quite well.  <br />Even though to hear Beverly tell it, she sounds as if she sold him to child prostitution and broke his bones to get alms from strangers on the adcvice of her boyfriends.  <br /> Beverly, ease up, you weren't THAT bad of a mother!<br />She was a teenage mom who married a loon because she got pregnant. She resented her son for 'grounding' her during her youth, and avoided some tough choices by being his &quot;pal&quot; rather than his Mom.<br />Oh yes she also (gasp!) got involved with even weirder men and made a mess of her life while Jason tagged along--Ok, so it won't win he Donna Reed/ Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, but she wasn't exactly a Kennedy who could afford 3 nannies for Jason. As a matter of fact, she was essentially a kid herself who got very little help from anyone. <br />Plus there were episodes in which her behavior in defending her son were brave and truly exemplary but she dsmisses them when contrasting them to her acts of selfishness. <br /> In any case, above all, this is a touching story, remarkably free of sentimentality and very, very human.<br />thanks, Beverly.	2002-01-13

Freud was merely a rational atheist. Jung not only believes in God but in 'Answer to Job' he has the temerity to psychoanalise Him. . .<br />The reuslts are provocative.<br />Jung reasons that God was a schmuck towards Job (and by extension to all innocents who suffer from 'acts of God') due to His not being fully conscious. A strange theory since, it would seem that by definiton God is Omniscient. <br />However God, in Jung's model, contains all opposites and paradoxes--including choosing not to consult Himself. Had He done so, He could have seen that Job would  have been faithfull to the end and not needed to take  Satan's  &quot;bet&quot;.<BR> The devil is still able to waltz into heaven in the book of Job and complain about how rotten mankind is.<br /> Unconsciousness accounts why God allows evil, why He breaks His own covenant and commandments, and why throughout The Old Testament accounts in His dealings with Israel He often resembles a petulant child given to fits of rage towards his pet hamster. <br />In short, why the Jews were right to &quot;fear&quot; Him, big time.<br />In the end of, God pulls out all the stops and counters Job's anguished pleadings for an answer to his misery with a 'might makes right' speech; while all poor Job can do is declare that he knows that his 'Advocate' lives, and then shut up.<br /> Job is the moral winner while the seed of doubt is implanted in God that He's not exactly playing cricket, and His desire to Know culminates in the 'tour the force' (Jung's words) of The Incarnation.<br />Jesus (the Advocate) now had to be born so that God could experience how we poor slobs muddle through down here.<br />Christ's mission therefore is not only to save humanity, but  also God from His worse half. <br /> On the cross, when God shouts to God: 'Why have you forsaken me?' He's finally made the grade. <BR>The union of God and Man.<BR> <BR>Four stars only due to Jung's heavy prose and his peppering his paragraphs with  untranslated Greek--<br />At first the book seems like a joke (perhaps it is but is it a joke or a Joke?) but going from syllogism to syllogism  Jung does builds a  powerful if disturbing thesis. <br />Despite his protestations that this is a work of psychology, inevitably 'Answer to Job' becomes a fascinating and bizarre work of theology.	2002-01-12

This is my favorite nut book of all time, principally because it was written by THE most original thinker of the 20th century.<br /> A conspiracy book by a mediocre paranoid is par for the course; but one written by a genius of the first order is bound to be outstanding.<br />To fully understand M&amp;M one has to be somewhat conversant with Totem and Taboo, and Freud reiterates those basic premises here as well. Briefly they are as follows:<br />The origin of society begins with a tribe in which the dominant male gets all the women, including his sisters and Mommy.<br />His sons are understandably upset at being left out of the fun and complain, so Dad kills or castrates them.  Or  makes the mistake of being lenient and simply drives them off.<br />The sons, unable to find females of their own, band together go back and murder dad. Then, of course, they eat his body.<br />There being too many sons (and feeling repressed guilt at killing their old man) they make taboos against incest thus establishing the rule of law. <br />(Bet you didn't know this was the origin of Magna Carta, et al).<br />This keeps the gene pool safe from inbreeding but leads to all sorts of guilt feelings which get acted out politically-- not the least of which is a worshipping of Mommy, which leads to LHM -a Literal Historical Matriarchy.<br />(And to think feminists dislike Freud)<br />Next, they get fed up with being bossed about by Mom  (and who wouldn't?) so they re-establish the patriarchy; only this time they stick to the rule of law, because they can't afford further fraticidal bloodshed and they invent polytheism to boot.<br /> But deeply repressed father hatred looms within, which leads to the final step: monotheism, in which God is an avenging Father who must be appeased before he starts castrating again. . . <br />(Naturally there are sub-plots--Christianity belongs to the religion of The Son who becomes more important than The Father, Islam is a attempt to restore The Father, etc.)<br />I forget what all this has to do with Moses, and halfway through the book, so does Freud who goes off on a tangent about how the Catholic church failed to  protect him in Vienna against the Nazis, so he was forced to flee to England, where things are now better, and though he thought of destroying the manuscript he figured he was old, so what the hell, might as well publish it.<br />Freud refuses to use the 's' word --speculate--Or rather he waffles. At one point he admits that all he's writing is conjecture and the reader should know that and not force him to repeat it in every paragraph. But a couple of paragraphs later, he appeals to his clinical material (his patients and his own fantasies) and his deductive powers in a manner that could only be described as objective--or, to be less kind, dogmatic. Will the real S.G please stand up?<br />In any case, the speculations/objective deductions regarding Akhnaten, the case for there being 2 Moses's -one got murdered and presumably eaten by his children. The myth 'in reverse' of the childhood of Moses (don't ask) and what it all REALLY means make for fascinating and compelling reading.	2002-01-12
US	49532061	R1NPZHHUZ3BVR1	1573922471	14914026	Jihad in the West: Muslim Conquests from the 7th to the 21st Centuries	Books	4	27	28	N	N	If this is the Mercy of God what on earth must His anger be?	The book opens up by stating that the Muhammed revered in the Muslim psyche (The Prophet, Messiah, Compassionate Man of God) has nothing to do with the real Muhammed.<br />And  according to Fregosi the man, not the myth--wasn't terribly nice.<br />Muhammed is presented as a mass murderer, a condoner of assasins--he didn't take kindly to literary criticism-- a  covetous, bloodthirsty tyrant  who raped/took as concubine a 17 year old widow -he had her husband killed along with 500 other Jews-and she was the prettiest survivor. But then he also regularly beheaded POW's who couldn't pay their ransom ..., so it wasn't just fun and games, it was also business .  In fact according to Fregosi, if you had money you became ipso facto, Mohammed's enemy and unless you coughed it up, could expect to be tortured until you revealed where you had hidden it. Fregosi cites Muslim historians as well as non-Muslims and the Koran itself for his sources.<br />If correct, the founder of Islam makes Osama Bin Laden look like a moderate.<br /> Paradise is attained by dying in battle (babes and booze await in heaven--for Muslim women Paradise is ill defined) and committing acts of terror, such as assasination, in the name of God, counts as battle.<br />Meanwhile The Prophet split his spoils one fifth for himself and the rest for whomever helped him wipe out a passing caravan. <br />Granted, armed robbery has little to do with God or Mercy, but who can argue with success? Besides the angel Gabriel gave him special dispensation and he was the only one who spoke to Gabriel, so who were you to complain?<br />Eventually, this policy of pillage  made even his worst enemies back home in Mecca see the light and convert.  They no longer needed to fear for their lives and 75% of the loot beats getting your head chopped off any day.<br /> Thus the empire grew.<br />Then the more whacko/Machiavellian caliphs took over and made Muhammed look like a saint by comparison.<br />I think this book will tend toannoy a lot of Muslims.<br />The intellectual and artistic glory of Cordova was the exception,  not the rule and the world would have been better off if The Prophet hadn't married money and had spare time to go off into a cave and talk to angels.<br />Jihad is considered a 'sacrament'in Islam , which like early Judaism is a religion inseperable from the state--only a Muslim country can truly be just and it is the duty of the faithfull to conquer it. Usually via genecidal wars.<br />The difference is that the Hebrews confined their genecidal wars over 2,500 years ago at Canaan -see the account of Jericho--and were not commanded to tke over the  entire world <BR>(Perhaps if Joshua had spoken to Gabriel and offered all who joined up 75% plus booze and babes in the afterlife?)<br />Fregosi goes a wee bit overboard in failing to explain why out of a billion Muslims in the world today we are not cursed with at the very least 100 million kamakazi style terrorists; presumably the mythical Muhammed has put them in touch with the Mercy of God; or at least some Muslims have not been caught napping during the last 1,300 years of history and have some idea of reason and toleration.<br />Fregosi's most frightening thesis is that conditions are now ideal for the return of Jihad. He brings Osama's name in the very first chapter--at the time, unknown to most Americans, though clearly the architect of the car bombing of the then still existing World Trade Center and  American embassies--as an example of a modern day Jihad devotee. He also quotes the Ayatolla Khomeni, of unhappy memory, and the reader has to pause to realize that this was a political leader of the 1980's not the 7th century, when confronted by his er...devoutness.<br />Hearing these men carry on would be  equivalent of hearing the Pope order all Catholics to bomb abortion clinics, the Prime Minister of Israel command the army to stone to death any adultresses, or the British parliament pass a resolution to hang all witches as in the good old days of King James.<br />Fregosi quotes my favorite gambler, Blaise Pascal:  \\"Jesus Christ founded a world religion by commanding his followers to lay down their lives, Muhammed by commanding his followers to kill his enemies\\"<br />After reading his book, he appears to have a point--Even if 9/11 had never happenned or even now that we have to form a coalition of Muslim countries who are somewhat antagonistic to democracy, the rights of the individual and the USA.<br />We are back in the middle ages. Islam, or at least a substantial portion of it has gone over to madness.  Fregosi argues that the madness is inherent in the faith itself and cites from our newest ally, Pakistan, a section of the penal code which demands the death penalty for anyone who so much as insinuates any criticism against Muhammed.	2001-12-27
