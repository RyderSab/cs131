This follows the same pattern you'll find in \\"Death on the Nile\\", \\"Evil Under the Sun,\\" and many other popular titles.  A murder occurs among a group of people in a closed environment (here it's an archeological dig in Iraq).  One of the group must be the killer.  Of course Poirot figures it out, in time to give his usual long-winded presentation before the group, in which he delves into the entire history of all the participants before revealing the killer's identity with a grand flourish.<br /><br />Yes, it's formulaic and contrived.<br /><br />But what a great formula!<br /><br />Christie's writing sparkles, and it's the clarity and energy of her prose that makes her stories so enjoyable.  Modern mysteries, such as those of Ruth Rendell and P. D. James, are much more sophisticated and realistic.  Christie is much more a light read.  But she's so much fun that it almost doesn't matter how much it stretches credulity.  Poirot is a constantly delightful and charming character, the setting is well described, and Christie's writing keeps the plot humming along nicely.<br /><br />After finishing this one, I read \\"Murder at the Vicarage\\", even though I had just watched two TV productions of the story.  Although I knew \\"who dunnit\\", it was still a delightful read. These stories can be fun even if you know how they turn out.	2005-09-06

Once I got used to it, it wasn't hard to read, but you can't read it quickly.  A huge cast of characters (some of whom disappear and re-appear very abruptly) threatens to overwhelm the narrative.  Because there are so many people, there's no time to gift them with a back story or even describe them physically, so it's left up to the reader to fill in the blanks.<br /><br />There's certainly plenty of action.  Things happen continuously, but again it's left up to the reader to puzzle out who's who.  The cast of characters and glossary are helpful, but one is in the front of the book and the other's in back, and you'll find yourself stopping to flip to the front, then to the back, just to get a hint of what might be going on.  This makes the reading process something of a chore.<br /><br />I've started the second volume, \\"Deadhouse Gates\\", but it gets only more confusing, as very few of the characters from the first book are carried over, and you're left to puzzle out where/who/what/why on your own.  Writers shouldn't have to spell everything out, but how about a few clues (other than the glossaries)?<br /><br />Several plot threads disappear as abruptly as the characters.  A mage named Hairlock is dying on the battlefield; another mage transfers his life force into a marionette (!) only to destroy him a few hundred pages later.  Why rescue Hairlock at all?  Perhaps Erikson doesn't know, either.<br /><br />And that's just one example.<br /><br />On the other hand, I did finish it and haven't given up on the second book quite yet, because Erikson's writing is strong and I'm still curious to see if he really knows what he's doing or whether he's just messing around.  It's hard to tell at this stage.  There's a wonderful weirdness to it all, but for me it would work much better if we knew something about the characters and Erikson wasn't going out of his way to be so obscure.<br /><br />His writing has frequently compared to George R. R. Martin, but I'm certainly not looking forward to the rest of the series as I am with GRRM's work.  Martin is able to build a complex plot and world with richly developed characters, and it's all sparklingly clear, without spoon-feeding or repeating information.  Erikson seems to take pride in giving you as little information as possible, and is a much tougher challenge to read.frequently compared to George R. R.

There is far more detailed information about the pulp markets and Dent's career in Philip Jose Farmer's \\"Doc Savage an Apocalyptic Life\\".  Much of the text quotes from two sources:  Ron Goulart's \\"Cheap Thrills\\" and Will Murray's \\"The Secret Kenneth Robeson\\".  Ron Goulart is a pulp historian and award-winning SF author; Murray is a long time Doc Savage scholar and author of several Doc Savage books.<br /><br />Since so much of the information in this booklet is drawn from these two sources, I think my money would have been better spent hunting down copies of the Goulart and Murray books, rather than spending my money on this one.<br /><br />In any case, what you get is very skimpy --- 89 pages of very large print and very wide margins, plus a brief bibliography and index.  Hardly worth the price.	2005-05-28

NOTE:  The Blackmask edition has long since been discontinued, but Doc Savage is now being reprinted in a magazine facsimile form, available at comic shops.<br /><br />The Doc Savage sagas originally appeared between 1933 and 1949 in a monthly magazine, featuring one novel a month.  In 1965, Bantam Books began reprinting the series in a set of distinctive paperbacks; in 1990, they published the last of the 182 original stories, and issued a few new books.  After that, interest in the character appears to have faded out.<br /><br />Now e-publisher Blackmask is reprinting the series again, two to a volume.  (The later stories are much shorter and will probably appear four or five to a volume.)  For the first time, Blackmask is presenting the pulp magazine covers and interior illustrations, and has reset the type so that it's easier to read than the old Bantam paperbacks.<br /><br />A few minor flaws in these editions: the paragraph indents are too small, making the left margin look ragged; chapter titles sometimes appear at the bottom of a page, with the text on the next page, and periodically there are inexplicable extra blank lines added.  Most folks will likely not care much about this; the paper is of high quality and the books are a trade paperback size that is an improvement over the small Bantam paperbacks.<br /><br />But... nothing will ever surpass those Bantam covers.  It was the covers that snagged me in 1965, when I was eleven years old, and it was the covers that kept me coming back every once in a while for more.  Ideally, collectors will want the Bantams for the covers, and these new editions for reading.<br /><br />One other improvement: the stories are being republished in their original order.  Bantam reprinted them seemingly at random, so that the third story was published as #68.<br /><br />I would give this five stars, except for the sloppiness in typesetting.  And, let's face it: Lester Dent, who wrote most of these \\"novels\\" at breakneck, assembly line speeds, is hardly the world's most skilled writer.  Lots of exclamation points!  When none are necessary!  The passive voice is used frequently (i.e., \\"several cigarettes were smoked by the criminals as the minutes passed\\").  The characters are stick figures and Doc Savage is so omniscient and omnipotent that no one has a chance against him.  Unlike Superman, who is at least vulnerable to kryptonite, Doc has no real weaknesses and is always one step ahead of his opponents.<br /><br />So why do these stories work so well?  Despite his flaws as a writer, Dent had a certain vision.  If he'd had more time to polish his work, he might have been taken more seriously.  Could you crank out a 150-page novel every month and have any of it make sense?  Something has to happen on every page, in every paragraph.  Action, action, action... and it has to hang together.  Dent could do it, and he deserves some credit for making these stories, as camp and hokey as they sometimes are, so entertaining.led writer.  Lots of exclamation points!  When none are necessary!

His SPQR mystery series is the classical equivalent of Lawrence Sanders's McNally novels --- light, humorous, but dramatically absorbing.<br /><br />\\"Hannibal's Children\\" is something different.  Roberts's detailed knowledge of Roman culture, particularly its famed military science, is presented with a wealth of detail that occasionally overwhelms the story.  In the SPQR series, Roberts masterfully interweaves the historical information into the plot, but he is less successful here, perhaps because this is so clearly the first part of a series rather than a stand-alone novel.  It is less tightly plotted than the SPQR books, and is also less wry and cynical.<br /><br />However, the reader does get taken on a tour of the ancient world, from Carthage to Egypt, with a battle scene that is interesting if not rousing.  (I usually find battle scenes boring, even the ones in \\"War and Peace\\", so it's not faint praise for me to call this \\"interesting.\\")  There could be more in the way of character development; the hero Marcus Scipio lacks definition.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next book, although I will probably wait for the paperback.  Ideally, Roman fiction should inform as well as entertain; most of the books on the market today are strong on plot and romance but weaker on historical detail.  Roberts has a better grasp of the facts than anyone else I've read (except for Steven Saylor, who's about equal), so with tighter plotting and more character development he may have a masterpiece on his hands.<br /><br />I suppose I could do without the submarines, though.  That seemed more like a gimmick than a genuine plot device ... but maybe Roberts has some surprises up his sleeve.	2005-04-05

The characters were three-dimensional and completely believable, and the story --- for all that it's a comedy of manners --- packs more suspense than the vast majority of thrillers, and drives to a fascinating conclusion.<br /><br />This is the first time I've read Tom Wolfe.  I am also over 50 years old.  These facts may help explain my enthusiasm for this book; apparently younger readers have more mixed views.  While I don't regard this as an absolutely accurate portrait of modern college life, it rings true in many of its brilliant characterizations, and it's a safe bet that a great deal of it is true.<br /><br />I found Charlotte to be utterly charming, in her naivete, her as-yet-undirected brilliance, and the forces around her that ultimately force her to discard some of her illusions in order to survive.  All of us have to do that at some point in our lives.  She reminds me of Voltaire's Candide, the wide-eyed innocent in a sinister and conniving world, and her loneliness and need to belong, somehow, somewhere, touched me deeply.<br /><br />My college experience was nothing like this.  Not only did I graduate thirty years ago, but I grew up in a big city and attended school there.  My parents and friends were in the same city.  My social life was almost entirely off campus.  I never met a football player or a fraternity member.  I knew those things existed but they might just as well have been in another universe.  I did make several friends in class and shared a kind of \\"life of the mind\\" --- the intellectual nirvana that Charlotte Simmons seeks --- but my life was primarily outside school.  Still, I can identify with being alone in a crowd, trying to find somewhere to fit in, trying to establish an identity ... and to me, that quest is ultimately what this book is about.  Charlotte gets part way there, at the cost of her innocence.  But we all pay a price for learning, one way or another.ut we all pay a price for learning, one way or another. <br />	2004-12-14

Extending the themes and characters established in the Jerry Cornelius quartet, this follows the adventures (erotic and otherwise) of Jerry's sister Catherine and her sometime lover, the temporal adventuress Una Persson (first seen in Moorcock's Oswald Bastable books --- \\"Warlord of the Air\\", \\"Land Leviathan\\", \\"The Steel Tsar\\").<br /><br />Like the Jerry Cornelius books, this one is freely structured, as our heroines jump back and forth in time, exploring the highs and lows of the 20th century.  Jerry's formidable mother, Mrs. Cornelius, also emerges here as a major character.  (Jerry puts in a cameo or two.)<br /><br />Moorcock's writing here is several levels above his style in the Elric and Corum fantasies.  The author has often stated his preference for his comedies over his SF and fantasy; this novel is a successful hybrid that fuses the best elements of Moorcock's dramatic and antic work.<br /><br />I will concede that this is perhaps best appreciated by readers familiar with the Jerry Cornelius stories and may be more enjoyable if read in context.  Still, this is one of the author's most sophisticated works, one that paves the way for his later, more serious literary work such as \\"Byzantium Endures\\" and \\"Mother London.\\"<br /><br />An amusing and exciting read; highly recommended.	2004-05-02

This is one non-fiction book that is hard to put down.  A great read!<br />My impression, contrary to some of the reviews posted here, is that Joe Domanick has focused on the facts and is not pursuing a political agenda.  Much of what he says has been proven by recent events and makes sense in the light of the Rodney King case and its aftermath, as well as the O.J. case.  His criticism is focused on the leadership and structure of the LAPD, rather than on characterizing individual officers as inherently bad.

Bottom line, folks:  I started reading this over ten days ago, and I'd rather be writing this review than facing the chore of getting through 300 more pages of the book.  This is what Donald Rumsfeld might call \\"a long, hard slog.\\"<br />It's not BAD.  It's just not... compelling.  Fitfully absorbing, perhaps; that is, the story heats up temporarily and then subsides into tedium.  I'm still holding out hope that the pace will pick up in those last 300 pages I can't bring myself to face yet... but Steverino seems to be going in so many different directions here it's hard to get excited about it.<br />I absolutely loved the first four books in the Dark Tower series, particularly \\"Wizard and Glass\\", which I feel is one of King's finest works, a full-bodied fantasy novel remarkably free of some of Steverino's more irritating idiosyncracies.  So I looked forward eagerly to \\"Wolves of the Calla.\\"<br />I realize I'm being premature as I still haven't finished it.  But frankly, folks, I wish someone would just tell me what happens so I don't have to bother.  Anyone by chance have the Cliff's Notes for this book? A novel of this kind should demand your attention, and \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" never quite does that.  There are a couple of scenes where Roland makes a gesture with his finger signifying \\"Get on with it\\", and that's how I feel about much of this book.<br />Hard-core King fans will probably go easier on the Master than I do. I love some of his books and stories; others, less so.  But so far this is a story that just smolders and never catches fire.  A major disappointment.	2003-12-04

And they aren't short, either --- he seems to have a contractual minimum of 600 pages per novel.  Anyone pumping out fiction at this pace can be expected to run hot or cold, and Turtledove is no exception.<br />The original World War quartet (this one is the second in a &quot;sequel&quot; trilogy) was fresh and consistently exciting.  Unfortunately, this follow up spends too much time rehashing the plot of the original and padding the pages with endlessly repetitive prose.<br />Turtledove, at his best, is one heckuva skilled storyteller, but he's never an elegant writer.  In this book he is just plain sloppy and long-winded.  He never lets an opportunity go by to belabor the obvious:  i.e., &quot;He didn't like it.  Not even a little bit he didn't.&quot;  and &quot;He thought he saw movement.  But then again, maybe he didn't, too.&quot;  If the plot was lively enough it might be possible to ignore this turgid, clotted prose, but since the story moves at a glacial pace, and the characters are cardboard cutouts, it gets pretty wearying.<br />Even though this one ends on a cliffhanger, I've let six months go by and haven't looked at volume 3.  I just can't face any more sentences like &quot;After what seemed like forever --- but really wasn't....&quot;<br />I'd recommend the World War series, or the books beginning with &quot;How Few Remain&quot; and the &quot;Great War&quot; novels.  But this one... well, let's put it this way:  Harry needs to hire an editor.  Someone who can pull out the weeds and dig the rocks out of the ground and do some verbal landscaping.  A sleeker, shorter novel without endless repetition would do much better.  Hey, Harry it's OK to write a 200 page book!	2003-01-16

This volume, eight in the series, contains three novels and one short story, none of which have any obvious connection to the \\"Eternal Champion\\" theme.  The tales do have some common elements, however; all four pieces feature a group of travelers fleeing a crumbling or decaying society and looking for solutions elsewhere, or \\"elsewhen.\\"<br />The Ice Schooner depicts a future Ice Age.  A small civilization is established on the ice fields, cities are built into crevasses, and trades and whalers ply the frozen oceans in their ice ships.  Konrad Arflane, a typically moody and grim Moorcock hero, undertakes a quest to New York to discover why the ice is melting and his civilization possibly coming to an end.  A rare example of pure SF from Moorcock; well told and atmospheric, with a perhaps too hasty resolution.<br />The Black Corridor, written with Moorcock's then-wife Hilary Bailey, reads more like a Robert Silverberg novel than Moorcock piece.  A group of space travelers in cryogenic freeze are fleeing an Earth where xenophobia and war are destroying civilization.  One man remains awake to operate the spaceship, and reflects on his final years on Earth, as the world crumbles around him.  This is one of Moorcock's best works, taut, suspenseful, evocative, and horrifying. I've read this one three times since it originally appeared in 1969, and it still has an impact... and I'm not sure I completely understand it.<br />The Distant Suns, a collaboration with British artist and author James Cawthorn, appears in this volume for the first time in the U.S.  Again, civilization is crumbling and a trio of space explorers set out to find an answer.  (The characters are Jerry, Frank, and Catherine Cornelius, but names aside, they have no apparent connection to the Cornelius characters of Moorcock's other stories.)  Written in a hyperventilating pulp style, the purpose here is perhaps to satirize pulp SF clich&eacute;s, but the authors mimic the purple prose of the 40s too closely for my taste, and I quickly tired of this one, skimming through the last hundred pages to get a general idea of the plot.  This ranks as one of Moorcock's misses for me... or perhaps I just missed the point.<br />Flux, a short story written with Barrington J. Bayley, describes a near future Europe, again facing imminent destruction, which sends an operative into the future to discover a solution.  Anyone familiar with Bayley's work will not be surprised to find this story brimming over with madcap ideas.

His prose is a straightforward pulp style, without literary pretensions or stylistic experiments.

If you like the writing of Philip K. Dick, Alfred Bester, or Robert Sheckley, you're almost certain to be a Bayley fan, and this collection of superb stories is a good place to start.  Bayley's work combines the social concerns of Dick, Bester, Sheckley, and Frederik Pohl with some of the more philosophical issues of \\"hard\\" SF writers such as Heinlein and Poul Anderson.

If you haven't read the previous books in this series, don't buy this one.  Don't even bother reading this review.  Check out the reviews for the first book and take it from there.  The stories in this volume contain so many references to characters and events developed in earlier books that some bits won't make sense unless you're well versed in Wild Card lore.<br />Also, if you're a fan of George R. R. Martin's work in the Song of Ice and Fire stories, you should know that the Wild Cards series is nothing like that.  Martin does write a fair amount of material, particularly in the earlier volumes of the series, but this is a peculiar kind of science fiction without any of the elements that have made Ice and Fire so popular.<br />Fans of the series may find this new book disappointing.  The theme is \\"deuces\\" --- wild cards with minor or even seemingly silly abilities --- and the stories are set in different time periods, from the late sixties till the present day.  Although the title page carries the usual \\"mosaic novel\\" tag, this is really an anthology of seven stories, and since there is no connecting narrative or sequence of events to tie the pieces together, the book lacks the impact of earlier volumes.  Part of the genius of the \\"mosaic novel\\" concept was the cumulative effect of several shorter pieces that fit smoothly into a greater whole, and that is noticeably absent here.<br />That's not to say that there is isn't the usual fine writing.  I was particularly impressed by first time contributor David Abraham's story, which is touching, suspenseful, and moving.  John J. Miller provides a brilliant baseball story, and Melinda Snodgrass's Hollywood tale is enjoyable.  Kevin Andrew Murphy's piece is the weakest; although it bristles with fascinating ideas, the plot lumbers along and doesn't quite support the weight of the concepts.  Michael Cassutt's and Walton Simons's contributions are good, but not spectacular; and Stephen Leigh's story is slightly below par for him.<br />Of course this is essential reading, but not quite up to the standard set by earlier books, particularly Volumes 1-7.

Not only is it very dated today, it was dated when it was published back in 1977.<br />SF writer and historian Gunn was an English professor at the University of Kansas, and this novel is his response to the student radicals of the 1960s.  He depicts a future United States in which revolution has become a way of life on campus.  The students rule the roost, at least in theory, and carry on meaningless \\"revolutionary\\" activities, while living a life of drug-addled self indulgence.  Learning is chemically administered, and professors hawk their classes like barkers at a carnival.<br />Student Tom Gavin is part of all this, until he meets a traditional professor who offers him real learning the old-fashioned way.  Gavin eventually leaves the enclave of the \\"kampus\\", which is surrounded by a containment wall from which snipers periodically take aim at the students, and begins a journey west to Berkeley.  His episodic quest takes him through a fragmented nation in which the old concepts of law and order no longer exist, although they are making a comeback in some regions.  Gavin encounters familiar SF scenarios from the 70s such as group marriage, and eventually arrives in Berkeley to resolve his revolutionary quest.<br />While it's not exactly a conservative screed, it's a very argumentative piece, although Gunn manages to keep the plot rolling along briskly enough so that the story doesn't get too talky.  The two major weaknesses are the dated subject matter (the radical student movement died out almost completely by 1972), and the lack of any character development for Tom Gavin, the protagonist.  He remains a virtual cipher, although his love interest, Elaine, has some substance.  Also, Gunn never paints a coherent picture of how the US has come to its current state; he offers a vague outline, but the logic of his future society is not entirely consistent.<br />It's an enjoyable work, but not as thought-provoking as it could be if it were more (dare I say it) relevant.  If you haven't read Gunn before, I recommend \\"The Immortals\\", \\"The Joy Makers\\", or \\"The Listeners\\", which contain his best work.could be if it were more (dare I say it) relevant.

Although I was a Bradbury fan, and found the tone and premise intriguing, I could never get past the opening chapters, usually setting it aside about the time the carnival pulls into town.<br />35 years later, I finally read it.<br />I didn't lose anything by waiting, because I'm sure my younger self would have been disappointed.  This story has a lot to offer in terms of its philosophical mood, and has a haunting quality to it, but it's told in a surrealistic style that is not always clear, and Bradbury's prose is clotted with numerous tangled metaphors and sentences that make no literal sense.  It's still not what I'd call a difficult read; I whipped through it in a few days.  Bradbury maintains an element of suspense(more by suggestion than by clearly describing anything) and the conclusion, although slightly heavy-handed, is satisfying.<br />&quot;Something Wicked this way Comes&quot; reminds me of two books:  &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; by Madeleine L'Engle, a children's novel which made a tremendous impression on me when I was nine years old; and Stephen King's &quot;Needful Things&quot;, which has a similar theme.  There are probably dozens of stories using this theme; since this one was published 40 years ago it's not fair to call it derivative, but I'm not sure if it's genuinely original.  None of that really matters, though, since it's Bradbury's feel for the time and place, and his accurate depiction of the adolescent point of view that make this story effective, in spite of its frequent wordiness, obscurity, and overwriting.  Sometimes the best writers can get away with bad writing --- or what would be bad writing in the hands of a less capable author --- and that seems to me to be the case here.<br />As others have observed, it's not a horror novel; more of a dark fantasy with a positive underlying theme.  I find it encouraging that so many young people are reading and enjoying this book; although I'm not wild about it, it's likely to whet the appetite for further reading.<br />If you haven't read Bradbury before, I recommend the short story collections such as &quot;Illustrated Man&quot; or &quot;October Country&quot;; or the novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, and the collection of linked stories that forms his masterpiece &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot;people are reading and enjoying this book; although I'm not wild about it, it's likely to whet the appetite for further reading.<br />If you haven't read Bradbury before, I recommend the short story collections such as &quot;Illustrated Man&quot; or &quot;October Country&quot;; or the novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, and the collection of linked stories that forms his masterpiece &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot;	2002-03-27

Campbell, the editor of Astounding SF magazine who published many of Silverberg's early work, and launched the careers of Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein, had a hard-and-fast rule that aliens and mutants must always be defeated by humans.  No matter how powerful the creature, humans must win out.  This caused him to reject a lot of great SF that probed gray areas --- what if there's something out there that (to quote Star Trek's &quot;Errand of Mercy&quot; episode) &quot;are as far above us as we are above the amoeba.&quot;<br />The Alien Years is about an invasion by aliens whose physical and technological superiority to humans is so great that they treat the conquered species with complete and utter contempt.  They probe human minds only to learn how people can be put to work.  They don't bother to speak to us.  We never learn what they want, and despite numerous efforts at resistance, we are never able to achieve anything.<br />Readers looking for a fast paced adventure story a la Campbell, in which humans triumph over the bug-eyed monsters, will be disappointed in The Alien Years.  It's often engrossing, and Silverberg's luminous prose creates strong suspense, but many readers will feel cheated by the oblique ending (just as one of the main characters feels cheated by the end of H.G. Wells's War of the Worlds).<br />This is a &quot;fix-up&quot; novel; that is, it's put together from a series of short stories published by Silverberg over the last 15 years, beginning with &quot;Against Babylon&quot; in 1986 and the Nebula winning &quot;The Pardoner's Tale&quot; a few years later, followed in the late 90s by several installments published in Science Fiction Age magazine.  (Oddly the credits make no mention of the fact that much of this material has been previously published, albeit in different form.)  This accounts for the episodic structure of the story, which covers a fifty-year period; in spite of this the pieces fit together well.<br />My only criticisms are a lack of character development, and occasional sloppiness in the editing.  (Silverberg has an annoying habit of adding &quot;yes&quot; to almost anything:  i.e., &quot;He was afraid, yes, but...&quot;).  Even the characters talk this way.  Perhaps this is to be expected, yes, from an author in his 70s who has written more than 100 books, but some light editing could have weeded out some of those 'yeses'.<br />Silverberg is a brilliant writer, yes, but The Alien Years is hardly his best work, and while I recommend it to those who are already fans of his work, if you haven't read Silverberg before I'd start with a stronger piece, such as &quot;Dying Inside&quot;, &quot;The Book of Skulls&quot;, or &quot;Downward to the Earth.&quot;es fit together well.<br />My only criticisms are a lack of character development, and occasional sloppiness in the editing.

There was just enough story here to keep me reading, in spite of the cardboard characters and juvenile writing.<br />Although this book is atrociously written --- painfully inept metaphors and similes, scant descriptions that fall flat, and an overall tone that hovers somewhere between Doc Savage and Superman comics of the mid-sixties --- Herbert's notes provide a strong basis for the plot, which is engrossing at a pulp-fiction level.  It's been more than 25 years since I read the original novel, so I wasn't bothered by the inconsistencies that would be apparent to a hard-core Dune fan.<br />It's a shame that a good editor didn't intervene and clean up all the unnecessary modifiers and given the text some polish.  Still, that hasn't stopped the book from selling, so it's not hard to guess why nobody at Bantam cared.<br />Kevin J. Anderson has been nominated for Nebula awards and Bram Stoker awards.  Either his other books are infinitely better written than this one, or the Science Fiction Writers of America have drastically lowered their standards.<br />If you're not a true-blue Dune fan, you may enjoy this as a light read with a few interesting ideas.  But be ready for some really, really bad prose.  These clowns make Michael Crichton look like Hemingway.  Even Jackie Collins's writing doesn't contain basic mistakes such as you'll find here.<br />Nevertheless, it's only fair to tell you that I'm more than halfway through the second volume, and having a good time (although wincing every so often).  Not only that, but it's whetted my appetite to go back to Frank Herbert's original books (which are stylistically sophisticated and far more imaginative); so Anderson and B. Herbert must be doing something right.	2001-09-27
US	50325280	R1KOX1HTVKN27J	0441172717	88529599	Dune	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Nothing else like it	Dune is one of the most popular science fiction novels, and with good reason.  If nothing else, it's ambitious; a complex plot draws on elements from ancient and medieval history as well as Islamic culture, blending ecology, politics, messianic religion and mysticism to create a long, sometimes engrossing, sometimes baffling tale of a young superhero who revolutionizes galactic civilization.<br />The novel has several flaws; much of the mysticism is not luminously clear, and much of the dialogue is stilted.  Herbert's style is in the process of maturing here; it's a quirky and distinctive voice, and his writing is generally of high quality, but the pacing is uneven, and many readers will find the book difficult to get into.  (I started it seven times over a period of several years before it finally caught on for me; and Herbert himself admitted the book was not an easy start.)<br />With so many details involved in the story, it's not surprising that there are questions and plot holes.  Some readers may find the characters two-dimensional, and Paul Atreides, the hero, remains remote.  Still, Herbert deserves credit for tackling so many issues in the context of a science fiction adventure, and also for constructing what's basically a Van Vogt-style superman story whose central character is opaque, rather than the straight-up-and-down hero a more simplistic writer might have created.<br />Many of Herbert's ideas don't fit comfortably into a single novel, even one of this length; I found that I came to enjoy both his writing style and his ideas as I read further books in the series.<br />This is a worthwhile book that deserves all the attention it's garnered, but many readers should expect to be patient and to make a certain effort to get used to Herbert's approach to storytelling.  The opening chapter is a stunner and immediately grabs your attention, but the book shifts gears after that and takes another fifty pages or so to pick up the pace.  But stick with it --- it's fascinating and rewarding.- it's fascinating and rewarding.	2001-09-08

From the first few pages I was engrossed in the story, and even before the heroine is whisked off to ancient Carnuntum I was staying up past my bedtime.<br />From a literary standpoint this can hardly be compared to &quot;I, Claudius&quot;; but then, Robert Graves was one of the foremost English stylists of all time, and comparing anyone to him is somewhat like comparing them to Shakespeare or Tolstoy.  Turtledove and Tarr are nowhere near that territory, but they're not kidding you about that: stylistic shortcomings aside, the storytelling is solid, and this is one of the most believable, palpable reconstructions of ancient Rome that I've read.  At the end I found myself missing the characters and wanting to know more about them (at least, those in ancient Carnuntum).<br />I'd have to rank this as one of the best books to carry Turtledove's byline.  Tarr's style blends well with Turtledove's vanilla prose and while this is still light reading, the writing is more solid than in the World War and Great War series.  A very entertaining and thought-provoking historical fantasy.	2001-09-03

This was a paperback original, originally published several years before Sanders became popular with hard-hitting detective fiction such as &quot;The First Deadly Sin&quot; and &quot;The Anderson Tapes.&quot;  The story is enjoyable but never compelling.  Both fans of the frothy McNally books and Sanders's darker works such as the &quot;Sins&quot; books will most likely be disappointed.  True Sanders fans won't want to pass this up, but don't expect too much.	2001-07-18

A scientist invents a \\"Super-EEG\\" scanning device that clearly shows an electrical field leaving a human body after death.  This is quickly dubbed \\"the soulwave\\" and is widely accepted as proof of the existence of a soul and life after death.  Robert Sawyer delves into meaty philosophical questions... and then veers off into a tepid murder-thriller.<br />Rather than explore the dramatic impact on society that we could expect from the discovery of the \\"soulwave\\", the scientist hero, Peter Hobson, decides to explore life after death by setting up a computer simulation of himself, with the biological sensations edited out.  He also creates a simulation of immortality (knowledge of death is edited out) and a control.  One of them becomes a killer, and Hobson ultimately has to race to the rescue to solve the mystery.<br />It's all very briskly told and enjoyable, but I can't help wondering what a writer like Robert Silverberg would have done with the \\"soulwave\\" issue.  Sawyer raises the questions and then drops them in favor of the much less interesting artificial intelligence mystery.<br />Some of the characterizations are believable, if not complex; the central character remains somewhat wooden.  On the plus side, Sawyer's fast-paced narrative and his willingness to raise hot-button moral issues make this a worthwhile read.  I'd recommend this, but I can't help wishing it had taken the initial premise further.<br />The original title \\"Hobson's Choice\\" was better; but the publishers, rather than the author, are likely responsible for the change.	2001-06-27

As always, Puzo creates fascinating characters, but this story is so brief that few of these characters have the opportunity to come to life.  This book is really a movie treatment, and I won't be surprised if the movie is more enjoyable than the book, which is redeemed only by Puzo's gift for description and his talent for delightfully cynical aphorisms.<br />We'll never know if Puzo intended to do more with this story.  It would be easy to believe that Omerta was a first draft and that if Puzo's health had been better he might have breathed more life into it.  As it stands, it's a predictable, fairly bland story, with familiar plot elements that fans of Puzo's earlier Mafia works are accustomed to.<br />It's become more difficult to believe in Puzo's mythological wiseguys, after films like \\"Goodfellas\\", \\"Donnie Brasco\\" and the TV series \\"The Sopranos\\" have given us a more realistic view of what these people are like.  Puzo himself expressed contempt for his own myth, saying of the Godfather, \\"I made it all up\\", and \\"I wrote it to make money.\\"  This lack of respect for his own material was evident in The Godfather and even more so in The Last Don; however Puzo's talent for character development and ear for dialogue made these novels compelling in spite of their pulp origins.<br />However, Omerta didn't have enough substance in it to hold my interest.  I enjoyed bits and pieces of it, but I expect the movie will be more fun.	2001-05-31

Very few writers can sustain a work of this length --- taken together, the three volumes run about 1,800 pages --- and the pacing wasn't lively enough to keep me interested.<br />The series has some compelling concepts, and even the battle scenes in the first two were vivid enough to keep me interested, in spite of the mostly two-dimensional characters, but after a while it got very tedious for me.  Stephen Vincent Benet, a great American story writer, once said that &quot;writing is the art of abbrevation.&quot;  Unfortunately, Stirling doesn't get to the point too often, and the plot is weighed down with long, windy descriptive passages that don't advance the story.<br />Looks like most readers who liked the first two will enjoy this one as well, but it was too much for me.	2001-05-17

Based on the life of controversial Episcopal Bishop James Pike, who was a close friend of the author's, this is one of Dick's best written novels.  Many of his earlier works were produced at a blisteringly fast pace, without much time for revision; some of them are essentially first drafts.  Here, in Dick's last work, he slows down enough to polish his prose and put events in their proper context.  The result is a fascinating and deeply moving story.<br />Although this novel is usually billed as part of a trilogy or series, its sole connection with &quot;VALIS&quot; and &quot;Divine Invasion&quot; is that the story has a religious theme.  Otherwise there is no connection.	2001-04-26

I kept intending to go back to bed and sleep, but couldn't put this down.  So much for it being boring.<br />Still, I could say the same about virtually any of Rendell/Vine's work.  \\"Grasshopper\\" features rich characterizations and a fine narrative that carries the story rattling forward.  Where it falls short of her earlier achievements is in the plot, which is contrived in places.  Elements from previous works (\\"A Fatal Inversion,\\" \\"King Solomon's Carpet\\", and \\"The Tree of Hands\\") are recycled here, less effectively than in the earlier works.  Rendell always drops subtle hints about what is to come and makes extensive use of foreshadowing, but here the payoff is less than what her readers have come to expect.  Usually she succeeds in delivering at least one jaw-dropping surprise per book, and puts in a vicious twist of the knife at the end.  Unfortunately, she does not do that in \\"Grasshopper.\\"<br />In spite of these shortcomings, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The central character in particular is believable and appealing, and as always the narrative is peppered with Rendell's keen observations of human behavior.  I would recommend this book for those familiar with her work; however for those who are not, \\"A Fatal Inversion\\" or \\"A Dark-Adapted Eye\\" are better places to start.  (For a very fast read, try \\"The Tree of Hands\\", or \\"Going Wrong.\\")	2001-03-08

I managed to force my way through the first 285 pages before I gave up on it, and skipped ahead to see if there were any interesting turns of plot that might have made it worth the while to keep reading.  Nope, no surprises.<br />I did enjoy some of the observations about Soviet life, which were interesting from a cultural standpoint.  However, the characters are cardboard cutouts, and the story moves at a glacial pace.  There are many long scenes composed entirely of dialogue that doesn't advance the plot.<br />As you will see by reading the other reviews posted here, most readers found something very different in this book.  However, I found it much less enjoyable than a Fredrick Forsyth thriller, or even an Ian Fleming novel.  It's just too bland to be interesting.	2001-02-11

Her narrative is good and the dialogue is sharp, but her descriptive passages are frequently awkward (just what do &quot;shadowy deer&quot; look like?).<br />Overall, I found the characters more interesting than the plot, although you certainly won't guess the identity of the killer.  I didn't care for the occasional snide potshots at liberals, as if only people who share Cornwell's conservative views are capable of sharing her moral outrage at the brutal murder of a child.  These asides contribute nothing to the plot and are distracting; however, judging from the other reviews posted here, Cornwell's readers are a pretty conservative bunch anyway.<br />I'd recommend this book as a light read for those with a special interest in forensic pathology (Cornwell's research is quite good).  As a crime novel, it's hardly in the top rank, but you won't be bored.	2001-01-11

Martin's mammoth fantasy epic, and it's as enjoyable and engrossing as the first two volumes.  Martin is a brilliant author, whose sparkling prose brings a scene vividly to life.<br />This is the kind of book that gets you thinking about the characters as if they were real people.  Virtually every fantasy series claims to present a &quot;fully realized imaginary world&quot; but this is the only one that has done it for me, and that includes Tolkien.<br />There are some legitimate criticisms.  The torrent of names can become overwhelming at times, especially with the large number of minor characters and the way allegiances can change abruptly.  Arya Stark's wanderings become meanderings for a while, and some passages seem to have just a bit too much description.  Perhaps the narrative could have been trimmed a bit.<br />However, my reaction to any confusion as to who's who is to go back and re-read the first two books.  It's going to be a long wait until the next volume!<br />There's still a lot of story to be told here.  Although major changes occur in the lives of all major characters (and most of the minor ones), one can't help wishing the next installment were already on the shelves, so that we could continue with this marvelous story.  Still, if Martin had telescoped it down to one or two volumes it certainly wouldn't have the texture and richness that it does.<br />There's real storytelling magic at work here.	2000-11-24

This sequel to &quot;Sorcerers of Majipoor&quot; has to rank as one of Silverberg's weakest efforts.  &quot;Sorcerers&quot; was a simple enough story but it was reasonably compelling; however, in &quot;Lord Prestimion&quot; not much happens.  The Coronal and his lieutenants traipse about the globe for several hundred pages unitl it's time to wrap things up.  Even Silverberg's luminous prose can't make up for the fact that there isn't much of a story to be told.<br />Fundamentally, Majipoor makes no sense.  The larger a planet, the less unified it would be and the more unstable the politics.  On Majipoor, we are asked to believe, not only is there one language and culture but the same political system has existed without change for thousands of years.  With a sufficiently vigorous plot, one can overlook this and suspend one's disbelief, but there's not enough going on here to distract you from the man behind the curtain (so to speak).<br />Jack Vance's Big Planet, by contrast, depicts a giant-size world as it probably would be --- a thousand contentious cultures, no central political control of any kind, technology limited only by the lack of metals.  Surely Silverberg is familiar with this venerable work (in many ways, one of Vance's best); but Majipoor is fantasy, not SF.  Still, we know Silverberg can do much better.	2000-11-18

(His first story was published in 1945).  So it's  hardly surprising that this routine space adventure story, while still rich  with the inimitable Vance prose and dialogue, is somewhat languid and  plotless.  The premise is appealing enough, with the standard Vance hero  journeying from one exotic locale to another.  Unfortunately, this is  territory that Vance has explored many times, and it isn't long before the  plot runs out of steam, and trails off without any resolution.  I'm hoping  that Vance's health will allow him to write a sequel that will tie up the  loose ends; but Vance has a history of losing interest in some of his  stories and either letting them go, or tying them up in a perfunctory  manner.<br />Still, Vance is one of the four or five best writers of SF and  fantasy, and long time fans will enjoy this one for what it does have to  offer.  Those who are not familiar with Vance's work I would advise to try  the Planet of Adventure series or the Demon Princes novels, two of Vance's  most enjoyable works.	2000-09-03

The  events of the book center around his original meeting with Mara/Mona and  from there spiral outwards in many directions, gathering in a wide variety  of bizarre and loveable characters, and showcasing Miller's unparalleled  ear for language and gift for description.<br />Yes, there is plenty of sex in  Sexus, more so in fact than in any other Miller work.  Yes, much of it can  be dismissed as misogynistic chest-beating.  The sexual passages are not  sensuous or romantic or even erotic; they are satirical and in most cases  hysterically funny.  While some readers will of course be put off by  graphic sex of any kind, those with flexible tastes are in for some good  laughs, as well as virtuoso displays of first rate writing  talent.<br />&quot;Dirty parts&quot; aside, this vast ocean of a book tells a  powerful story that is compulsively readable throughout.  It is more  accessible than the &quot;Tropics&quot; pieces, which are more surrealist  and abstract; here Miller employs a much more straightforward  narrative.<br />This is probably one of the four or five most important works  in English to be published in the 20th century (and is in many respects a  repudiation of 19th century literature). Highly recommended for anyone with  a halfway-open mind.	2000-06-23

There's a narrative (sometimes) and striking, vivid language that you won't find anywhere else, but at times the fold-in method  of writing, a technique designed to subvert the rational process of  thought, yields paragraphs that are not merely irrational but garbled.  They're just clumps of words pasted together at random (as far as I can  tell).  This is not a novel in any sense of the term, nor it is a story,  but there are themes and images that perhaps could not be conveyed in a  conventional framework.<br />Nova Express was extremely influential for me  and has stayed with me for the last 30 years.  I don't pretend to  understand everything that Burroughs was trying to accomplish with this  kind of writing, but if affected me in ways that are hard to explain.<br />If  you are interested in experimental writing, surrealism, or non-linear  narrative, you may want to give Burroughs a try.  However if you're looking  for a good, comfortable read, this isn't the place to get it.	2000-05-08
