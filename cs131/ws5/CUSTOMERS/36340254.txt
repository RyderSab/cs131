Just after a tied match for the leadership of Crimsom, Turquoise and her rival Ravyn get hired for a job: Kill Jeshikah, a very powerful and influential vampire who once ruled \\"Midnight\\" a vampiric paradise that was burned centuries ago.<br /><br />To do so, Ravyn and Turquoise need to infitrate into the new Midnight. Only that the only way to do so is passing for slaves. Both hunters have their history with the trade and take the job. They get sell to the new master of Midnight, Jaguar.<br /><br />And what happens next? well, you gotta read it.<br /><br />My favorite character it's Jaguar, I found him refreshing because he is not the typical vamp one expects to find. Same with Nathaniel - a vampire who it's also a mercenary - and Gabriel... Ravyn it's fun too. Turquoise it's something else too, she has reasons to be how she is and that it's refreshing as well.	2004-09-28

Caitlin's father feels betrayed by his daugther, her mom barely realizes of anything anymore, and Caitlin is left alone to start her junior year with out her sister, with the sole support of Rina, her best friend, and Boo and Stuart, neighboors and best family friends.<br />Rina convinces Caitlin to try out for cheerleading, because that was one of the few things that Cass never did.

I highly recomend this book.<br />It's goes beyond the hiting problem, i think you can identify yourself there because more than about domestic violence, is about finding yourself when there are no pointers showing the way.<br />One of my favorite parts is when Caitlin wonders what would she think if saw this photograph of this girl that sits in her boyfriends lap so easily and how happy both looked (the ones in the photo are her and Rogerson), she says that she would have think that her life was perfect, just like once she had believed Cass's life to be perfect, she says that she had learned it was too easy to just asume thingsaph of this girl that sits in her boyfriends lap so easily and how happy both looked (the ones in the photo are her and Rogerson), she says that she would have think that her life was perfect, just like once she had believed Cass's life to be perfect, she says that she had learned it was too easy to just asume things	2004-04-10
