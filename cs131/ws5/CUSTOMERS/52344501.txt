The book is worth buying for the incredible short story - \\"Out of Copyright\\". I have found that the science fiction writers that people enjoy is as much about writing style as it is about the scope of the stories themselves. Maybe this is true in all genres. Anyway, Charles Sheffield is one of the science fiction writers I love, and I think that it is impossible to explain his writing style, you just have to experience it. So here is the beginning of the short story - \\"Out of Copyright\\" : <br /> <br />  Trouble-shooting. A splendid idea, and one that I agree with totally in principle. Bang! One bullet, and trouble bites the dust. But unfortunately trouble doesn't know the rules. <br />Trouble won't stay dead. <br /> <br />    I looked around the table. My trouble-shooting team was here. I was here. Unfortunately they were supposed to be headed for Jupiter and I ought to be down on Earth. In less than twenty-four hours the draft pick would begin. <br /> <br />    That wouldn't wait, and if I didn't leave in the next thirty minutes I would never make it in time. I needed to be in two places at once. I cursed the copyright laws and the single-copy restriction, and went to work. <br /> <br />    \\"You've read the new requirement,\\" I said. \\"You know the parameters. Ideas, anyone?\\" <br /> <br />  A dead silence. They were facing the problem in their own unique ways. Wolfgang Pauli looked half asleep, Thomas Edison was drawing little doll-figures on the table's surface, Enrico Fermi seemed to be counting on his fingers, and John von Neumann was staring impatiently at the other three. I was doing none of these things. I knew very well that wherever the solution would come from, it would not be from inside my head. My job was much more straightforward; I had to see that when we had a possible answer, it happened. And I had to see that we got one answer, not four... <br /> <br />Hopefully, that is enough of a teaser to get you interested. Enjoy!	2005-08-11

The author makes a compelling arguement for the necessity of politicians to become intimately involved in every aspect of the warmaking process. Using four examples of excellent democratic leadership of the military during wartime: Lincoln, Clemenceau, Churchill, and Ben-Gurion. These four break the current \\"normal theory of civil-military relations,\\" which holds that civilian leaders should set political goals and leave the details of implementation to the military. <br /> <br />\\"Historical judgement of war is subject to an inflexible law, either very imperfectly understood or very constantly lost sight of. Military writers love to fight over the campaigns of history exclusively by the rules of the professional chess-board, always subordinating, often totally ignoring, the element of politics. This is a radical error. Every war is begun,dominated,and ended by political considerations; without a nation, without a government, without money or credit, without popular enthusiasm which furnishes volunteers, or public support which endures conscription, there could be no army and no war - neither beginning nor end of methodical hostilities. War and politics, campaign and statecraft, are Siamese twins, inseperable and independent; and to talk of military operations without the direction and interference of an administration is as absurd as to plan a campaign without recruits, pay or rations.\\" <br /> <br />This book also shows the lack of historical knowledge that most of the American public has. Most Americans think the French are \\"wimps\\" because they have been against the war in Iraq. Let's look at World War I: <br /> <br />\\"France sustained casualties of 1,385,000 killed and 3,044,00 soldiers and civilians wounded in World War I, in all more than one-tenth of its total population of something under fourty million. In 1914 France, with a peacetime army of 823,000, had mobilized a total of 3,781,000 men; its casualties during the entire war, therefore, amounted to virtually the whole of its initial military strength...The battle of Verdun alone cost France, between February and December of 1916, 162,000 killed or missing in action and at least 200,000 more wounded; as Guy Pedroncini notes, a bell chiming once a minute for each French loss there would ring for four months without pause. Put differently, in that one battle, which took place during one year of the war, France lost almost three times as many men as the United States did in all of the Vietnam war. It suffered those losses from a population one sixth of that of the United States in the 1960's. One many think of French losses at Verdun alone, in other words, as the equivalent of eighteen Vietnams, suffered in one year.\\"   <br /> <br />Food for thought.	2004-10-27

This book is as good as \\"We Were Soldiers Once and Young\\". I wish everyone that has ever been told that \\"we lost the war in Vietnam because the politicians made us fight it with one had tied behind our back\\" would read this book. It shows that the war was not lost because of lack of effort on our part. Our soldiers fought bravely and valiantly and their efforts are just now starting to be recognized by the general public. The North Vietnamese Army were a brave and determined foe and were willing to fight to the last man. When you read about the type of firepower they were willing to wade through and would keep coming at you, you soon realize that they were willing to accept losses that we could not comprehend nor stomach politically. Short of genocide, there was no way for the United States to win the Vietnam war.<BR>  This book carries my highest recommendation.	2004-03-29

Hilarious! Bryson's best !	<sp><BR>This is the first Bill Bryson book that I bought and read. Since buying this book, I have also bought and read his other books - Neither Here Nor There, Notes From a Small Island, and Made In America.  It turns out that A Walk in the Woods is his very best. It has a lot of hilarious moments in it. I really enjoy his brand of humor. Living out West, I didn't even know about the existence of the Appalachian Trail until I read this book.  Besides being a great read, I learned a lot from this book, since Bill Bryson also tells you about how the trail came into being, and also tells you many interesting tidbits as you travel with him along the trail. Here are some of the things that I learned from the book:<br />The Appalachian Trail runs over 2,100 miles from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine, crossing through 14 states along the way. The Appalachian Trail was formally completed on August 14, 1937.<br />     \\"Every year between early March and late April, about 2,000 hikers set off from Springer Mountain, most of them intending to go all the way to Katahdin. No more than 10 percent actually make it. Half don't make it past central Virginia, less than a third of the way. A quarter get no farther than North Carolina, the next state. As many as 20 percent drop out the first week.\\"  (P.31)<br />\\"About 240 million acres of America's forests are owned by the government. The bulk of this - 191 million acres, spread over 155 parcels of land - is held by the U.S. Forest Service under the designations of National Forests, National Grasslands, and National Recreation Areas. The Forest Service is truly an extraordinary institution. A lot of people,  seeing that word forest in the title, assume it has something to do with looking after trees. In fact, no - thought that was the original plan... In fact, mostly what the Forest Service does is build roads. I am not kidding. There are 378,000 miles of roads in America's national forests. That may seem likea meaningless figure, but look at it this way - it is eight times the total mileage of America's interstate highway system. It is the largest road system in the world in control of a single body. The Forest Service has the second highest number of road engineers of any government institution on the planet. It is the avowed aim of the U.S. Forest Service to construct 580,000 miles of additional forest road by the middle of next century.<BR>     The reason that the Forest Service builds these roads, quite apart from the deep pleasure of doing noisy things in the woods with big yellow machines, is to allow private timber companies to get to previously inaccessible stands of trees....<BR>     Eighty percent of its leasing arrangements lost money, often vast amounts. In one typical deal, the Forest Service sold hundred-year-old lodgepole pines in the Targhee National Forest in Idaho for about $2 each after spending $4 per tree surveying the land, drawing up contracts, and, of course, building roads. Between 1989 and 1997, it lost an average of $242 million a year - almost $2 billion all told, according to the Wilderness Society.\\"  (P.46-48)<br />      \\" In constant dollars, the Park Service budget is $200 million dollars a year less than it was a decade ago. In consequence, even as visitor numbers have soared - from 79 million in 1960 to almost 270 million today - campsites and interpretation centers have been shut, warden numbers slashed, and essential maintenance deferred to a positively ludicrous degree. By 1997, the repair backlog for the national parks had reached $6 billion. All quite scandalous. But consider this. In 1991, as its trees were dying, its buildings crumbling, its visitors being turned away from campgrounds it could not afford to keep open, and its employees being laid off in record numbers, the National Park Service threw a seventy-fifth anniversary party for itself in Vail, Colorado. It spent $500,000 on the event....\\" (P.94)	2003-01-08

The core idea being that the best way to teach people about concepts is different than teaching people about a procedure. And that teaching people to memorize a list is very different from teaching principle-using behavior, and that the methods used to teach each type of learning are different. <BR> <BR>  To help you understand what the book is like, here is some quotes about using instructional strategy to teach a process: <BR> <BR> A process is a pattern of events. Procedural processes describe the influences and effects of a procedure as it is performed, from a third-person point of view. When procedure and process instruction are combined, a student learns to perform the procedure while at the same time learning how the procedure affects the environment in which the procedure is performed.(P.222) <BR> <BR><br />...Process knowledge is comprised of several possible event paths which events might follow depending on how conditions vary. The most superficial degree of process knowledge consists of memorizing the steps in a process.(P.225) <BR> <BR> Most explanations in science textbooks are delivered in the form of long paragraphs in which several process threads are intertwined, and only a few event paths out of the large number possible are presented, and a limited amount of information is given to help a student determine the other paths that might occur.<BR> <BR> Missing information may include missing events, incomplete description of the mechanisms for transition between event-states, confusing presentation of the mechanism, lacking specification of the conditions under which state-transitions take place, or lack of linkage between condition causes and event effects. (P.226)<BR> <BR> For process-using behavior to occur, a student must not only predict an outcome, but must also be able to supplya rationale for it. The student must be able to explain through a chain of reasoning why and how the outcome occurred.<BR> We have been careful to describe a process as a pattern of events and not as a sequence of events; now it is possible to see why. As natural elements are acted upon by all kinds of forces, energies, and signals, there are many forces acting at once, and so there are many possible outcomes depending on the forces acting, their magnitude, and their balance. Any set of circumstances can thus result in a large number of outcomes, depending on the final resolution of the forces. That means that a process as we experience it is not a fixed, rigid, unchanging sequence of events, but a possiblity with numerous outcomes - numerous possible event sequences. Process-using means being able to predict from a given set of elements and acting forces one or more possible outcomes. Process-using behavior deals in the cause-effect linkages between events and explains them in terms of force, energy, or signal transfer between related elements. (p.226) <BR> <BR> <BR> The nature of process instruction requires much stage setting. The difference in the requirements for environment description for novices and experts is the key to an important principle for all of process instruction. Process instruction, more than any other type of instruction, is prone to great compression. For process instruction, the instructional message can sometimes be compressed into a few words if the audience for the instruction is experienced and already has a great deal of knowledge in the content. For novices, the explanations must be detailed and explicit - sometimes painfully so. (P.235)	2001-07-31

I read this book for one of my instructional design classes - which focuses on how people learn - it is one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. It gives you alot to think about.  I think the best way to learn about a non-fiction book is through a series of quotes of what the person found interesting. So here are some quotes from the book:<br /><br />  &quot;In effect, once she decided to see their situation as one of betrayal, she didn't need to see it any other way. Aspects of the relationship between the two people unrelated to betrayal, or that contradicted the notion of betrayal, were forgotten. Seeing a particular story as an instance of a more general and universally known story causes the teller of the story to forget the differences between the particular and the general.<br /> ....In other words, the concept of betrayal becomes what she knows about this situation. It controls her memory of the situation so that new evidence of betrayal is more likely to get admitted into memory than contradictory evidence.&quot;(P.148)<br /><br />  &quot;...Is this relationship, however, an example of betrayal? Certainly, the teller relates the story so that betrayal is an accurate description. But betrayal was used as a skeleton story around which the actual story was constructed.<br />  In other words, by using a skeleton story for betrayal, the teller could only construct a story of betrayal. All other aspects of the story were left out. But why, for example, could the teller not have told a story of &quot;devotion&quot;? Only small changes would be needed to make this a story of devotion - a statement that he still loves her and hopes that she will return to her former self or one that shows he values and will support her in her role as mother. ....We want to see the situations that we encounter in terms that are describable to others. We only have a short time in which to tell these stories. So, even if the fit with those stories is not exact, seeing and describing complex stories in terms of standard stories provides an easy shorthand method for communication.&quot; (P.148-149)<br /><br />  &quot;The key point here is that once we find a belief and connected story, no further processing, no search for other beliefs need be done. We rarely look to understand a story in more than one way.&quot; (p.73)<br /><br />  &quot;The skeletons we use indicate our point of view. Storytelling causes us to adapt a point of view. With this adaption comes a kind of self-definition, however. We are the stories we tell. ...As we come to rely upon certain skeletons to express what has happened to us, we become incapable of seeing the world in any other way. The skeletons we use cause specific episodes to conform to one another. The more a given skeleton is used, the more stories it helps form begin to coher in memory. Consequently, we develop consistent, and rather inflexible points of view.&quot; (P.170)<br /><br />  &quot;An incident is remembered in terms of how it is seen in the first place. That is, labeling is in many respects an arbitrary process. ...And, of course, even that last categorization is arbitrary since one person might characterize the victim as being blond, while the other might characterise him as being fat.&quot; (P.222)<br /><br />  &quot;We would like to imagine that we learn from the stories of others, but we really only do so when the stories we hear relate to beliefs that we feel rather unsure of, ones that we are flirting with at the moment, so to speak. When we are wondering, consciously or unconsciously, about the truth, about how to act or understand some aspect of the world, then the evidence provided by others can be of some use.&quot; (P.78)<br /><br />  &quot;A good memory, then means an attentive labeling facility during processing or you aren't going to remember what you don't find interesting, so the more that interests you the better memory you are likely to have.&quot; (P.223-224)<br /><br />&quot;Yet what we learn is still entirely up to us. No one teaches us how to index after all. We make up our own way of seeing the world,...&quot; (P.113)<br /><br />  &quot;Knowing a great deal about a subject means being able to detect differences that will reflect themselves in differences in indexing. In other words, intelligence depends on clever indexing. Our expert is intelligent about military history. He sees nuances where others would not. He analyzes new stories well enough to be able to relate them to old stories that might not obviously be the same.&quot; (P.113)3-224)<BR> <BR>      &quot;Yet what we learn is still entirely up to us.

The Color Code is the first personality theory that explains the movivations of a personality type.  The Myers-Brigg personality theory which has 16 different categories, does a good job discussing &quot;how&quot; a certain personality type acts 90% of the time, but it never addresses the issue of &quot;why&quot; the person acts the way they do.<br />  Here are the different personalities motivation: Red's core motivation is power. Blue's core motivation is the desire for intimacy. White's core desire is peace or the absence of conflict. Yellow's just want to have fun.<br />Here is a quick compare and contrast over one trait: Reds are dedicated to causes. Blues are dedicated to people.

No one does emotional/ethical dilemmas like Card.<BR> <BR> The storyline: Ender Wiggin has become publicly known as The Speaker for the Dead - a new identity he created, after he is viewed as committing genocide against an entire alien race, after the end of the Bugger wars. Even though he saved the entire human race from certain destruction, the revisionist history makers have turned public opinion against him. The Speaker for the Dead offers his services on the interstellar communication network. Ender travels from planet to planet using lightspeed travel, which keeps him physically young but a tremendous amount of time occurs on earth, so most people assume Ender Wiggin is dead by now. <BR> <BR>   The story takes place on the planet Lusitania, where a alien race called the pequeninos is being studied. When one of the scientists studing this alien race has been killed in a ritual ceremony, the widow requests the services of The Speaker for the Dead. The idea is that a Speaker for the Dead comes and lives with the family of the deceased for about a year and goes to work were the person worked. The Speaker interviews all the co-workers, friends, teachers, and relatives of the deceased - anyone that knew the person. After about a year or a year and a half, a second funeral is held. All the community gathers together to hear the Speaker tell of the persons deepest hopes, fears,and aspirations. The Speaker tries to explain what drove the person to do what they did, with complete candor and total honesty. All the persons secrets are laid bare before everyone. The core idea is that we are a different person around different people. You talk and act very differently around your grandmother than a person does with their beer drinking buddies. You act different around your lover than you do around your friends. In essence, we have so many facets to who we are that no one person ever sees them alland truely knows who we are. <BR> <BR>   What make this book a facinating read is this: there is a small community of only around 150 humans studying this alien race. The entire planet is under quarantine. There is a degenerative virus that is highly contagious - a vacine has been created that slows the progress of the disease down to a crawl - it will take 10 years to kill you instead of a few weeks - but there still is no cure. So once you go down you don't come back -a blockade of battleships ensures this. The humans are confined to a fenced off area of about 2 square miles - this is all the area the humans have been given so that contact with the pequeninos is extremely limited - so their culture is not contaminated by the human presence. Only a small handful of scientists are allowed to make direct contact and study the pequeninos. <BR> <BR>   Ender falls in love with the widow of the man he has came to be Speaker of the Dead for. Ender discovers a terrible secret that will destroy the woman he loves and deeply hurt her children. So the dilemma that Ender has is this: Do you destroy yourself or the person you love? Ender is such a person of incredible integrity that he values the truth above all else. If he reveals the dark secret he has discovered it will severely damage the two two main groups of scientists working on the project - including the woman and her children who he has grown to deeply love. But if Ender didn't reveal the secret would betray his most deeply held values. It would be denying how he has defined his very core being from the beginning - he would have to throw out the essence of himself - because he could not live with the inner conflict.	2000-12-31

I have read all three of their books and they have convinced me that investing is common sense combined with a little bit of effort. Some of the common sense investment advice offered:<BR> <BR> Buisnesses that can put their products in the homes, pockets, or minds of millions of average people typically represent the best long term investments.<BR> Day trading is for idiots - long term investing is the only way to go. Between 1991 and 1996, University of California-Davis Buisness School professors Brad Barber and Terrance Odean investigated the performance of actively traded portfolios among sixty thousand households. And they found that a passive approach to investing in the overall market via an index fund delivered returns 70 percent better per year than actively traded portfolios. Extend these seperate rates of annual return out for decades, and it's like standing prices next to paupers. Off an initial investment of $10,000 , we're talking about a difference measured in hundreds of thousands of dollars. <BR> <BR> One of the facts that they pointed out in their first book - The Motley Fool Investment Guide - is that over the last five years 91 percent of mutual funds have underperformed the stock market's average return. It blew me away to find out that mutual fund managers were getting paid millions of dollars each year - when they can't even keep up to the stock market. They get paid a flat percentage based on the total amount of money in the mutual fund they are managing regardless of how poorly a job they do managing the fund!<BR> <BR>   One thing that has really impressed me is half the material in each of the Motley Fool books can be found at the Motley Fool website for free!  <BR> <BR> RULE BREAKERS ATTRIBUTES:<BR> #1 - Top dog and first-mover in an important, merging industry. <BR> #2 - Sustainable advantage gained through buisness momentum, patent protection, visionary leadership, or inept competitors. <BR> #3 - Strong past price appreciation equivalent to a relative-strength performance of 90 or higher. <BR> #4 - Good management and smart backing. <BR> #5 - The stronger the consumer appeal, the better: to attract, to habituate, to profit, and to protect. <BR> #6 - Grossly overvalued, according to at least one significant constituent of the financial media. <BR> <BR> <BR> RULE MAKER ATTRIBUTES:<BR> #1 - A manifestation of tireless commitment to either absorbing or dismantling every one of the pretenders to that same royal station. The asending maker must present its competition with a stark choice - cooperate or be demolished. <BR> #2 - patience <BR> #3 - Consistent improvement of their financial outlook. At least $1 billion in annual sales to be considered for Rule Maker status.<BR> #4 - A absolute commitment to convenience. Convenience rules the consumer landscape - convenience wins. <BR> #5 - The company probably involved in a nasty, loud lawsuit brought by one or many of its smaller competitors. <BR> <BR>	2000-12-20

The 64 cards are divided into four sixteen card suits: Explorer, Artist, Judge, and Warrior. These represent the four roles or types of thinking of the creative process. <BR> <BR>     The Explorer is your role for discovering the resources you'll use to create new ideas. The cards in the Explorer suit highlight places and ways to find new information. <BR> <BR>     The Artist is your role for transforming your resources into new ideas. The cards in the Artist suit provide you with idea-generating techniques. <BR> <BR>     The Judge is your role for evaluating an idea and deciding what to do with it. The cards in the Judge suit lend decision making advice. <BR> <BR>     The Warrior is your role for implementing your idea. The cards in the Warrior suit give you the &quot;kick&quot; you need to get your ideas into action. <BR> <BR>    There are several ways the cards can be used. One of the best is the &quot;Creative Licencing at Meetings&quot;. At the beginning of a meeting, deal out five cards to each participant. The cards give each person permission to make a point related to that card as you work though the meeting agenda. A participant may play a card at any time if he or she feels thtat its message will help the meeting. <BR> <BR>    Some examples of cards:<BR> <BR> Card #27 - CHANGE ITS NAME - If a architect looks at an opening between two rooms and thinks &quot;door&quot; that's what she will design. But if she thinks &quot;passageway&quot;, she may design something much different like a &quot;hallway&quot;, &quot;air curtain&quot;, &quot;tunnel&quot;, or perhaps a &quot;courtyard&quot;. Different words bring in different assumptions and lead your thinking in different directions. What else can you call your idea? <BR> <BR> Card #9 - USE A RANDOM IDEA - Open your mind up to things that have nothing to do with the idea you're developing. Pick out the third word on p.134 of your dictionary - &quot;broom&quot;. How does it relate to what you are doing? What similiarities does it have with your idea?  Can you use it as a metaphor? Look out your window and find the first thing that has blue in it - &quot;mailbox&quot;. How does it shed light on your idea? What random idea can you use to stimulate your thinking? <BR>	2000-12-15
US	52344501	R1YQ49ZLCM732H	0684833093	531000691	Lees Lieutenants (3 Volumes In One Abridged) : A Study in Command	Books	5	69	72	N	N	A excellent book on the Army of Northern Virginia	<BR>    I developed a strong interest in the Civil War four years ago after reading a biography on President Lincoln that touched on how frustrated he was with trying to find competent officers to lead the Army of the Potomac. When I drove to Knoxville, Tennessee I took the audio books Gods and Generals, and The Last Full Measure by Jeff Shaara with me. The descriptions of the battle ground and unfolding battle were so vivid that I could see it clearly in my mind. By the time, I was finished with both audio books I was hooked.<BR> <BR>     Since I completed both audio books by the time I drove from Utah to Tennessee, I picked up a copy of Grant Moves South (which is the story of the Union's western campaign) by Bruce Catton at Chattanooga,Tennessee when I went and saw the Chickamaga battlefield.  After seeing the war from the western point of view on the Union side I wanted to see the war from the Southern point of view on the eastern campaign - that led me to this book.<BR><br /><BR>     This book is an abridgement of the original three-volume version (the footnotes have been taken out). It is an incredibly well written book. It is a history of the army of Northern Virginia from the first shot fired to the surrender at Appomattox - but what makes this book unique is that it is a biography of around 150 Confederate officers. The book discusses in depth all the tradeoffs that were being made politically and militarily by the South. The book does an excellent job describing the battles, then at a critical decision point in the battle, the book focuses on an officer - the book stops and tells the biography of that person, and then goes back to the battle and tells what information the officer had at that point and the decision he made. At the end of the battle, the officers decisions are critiqued based on what he could have known and what he should have known given his experience, and that is compared with 20/20 hindsight. <BR> <BR>   An excellent read.	2000-12-07

She took one of the worst public schools in Harlem, New York and turned it around to the point that it is one of the top three public schools in New York and 96% of it's students are accepted into college. I believe that her insights and strategies can be used to improve any workplace or organization. Remember, she isn't some theorist - she actually has dramatic results in the real world -under some of the toughest odds imaginable! <BR><br /><BR>   She has some great strategies that can help anyone. Here is an example: <BR> <BR>    &quot;I developed the habit of never asking my superiors at the Board of Education for permission to carry out any innovation or other &quot;risky&quot; venture. I felt that if I asked, they would usually say no. After all, they were cautious, conservative people, interested in keeping their present jobs or moving up within the heirarchy. Taking risks isn't a good way of accomplishing either goal. <BR><br />.....My supervisor would come to the school for periodic visits, and I'd either tell him about our latest venture or let him see it for himself. I figured that it would be hard, even for a dyed-in-the-wool bureaucrat, to try to stop a program that was already running successfully. This approach worked like a charm; the supervisor was generally pleased to realise that the successful new program, whatever it was, had been started under his administration. As the saying goes. &quot;Success has many parents.&quot; When something is working, people are always ready and eager to bless it and share the credit.&quot; <BR> <BR>    Some more of the Monroe Doctrine: <BR> <BR>     &quot;I learned from Mr. Littwin that it's impossible to run any organization from behind a desk in an office. You've got to walk around, watch people work, schmooze with everyone, and make yourself visible. It's the only way to really know what's going on and to have a true impact on the operation.&quot; <BR> <BR>Pick up this book to get some inspiration on how you can make a dramatic difference in your organization.	2000-12-07

Every 30 years, young children start disappearing. The children are being preyed upon by what appears to be a circus clown. Only this isn't your ordinary circus clown. Pennywise isn't a clown, IT is a creature that can shapechange at will.  <BR> <BR> The story starts off in 1958. Pennywise has targeted seven individuals that are outcasts in junior high. These seven outcasts in junior high form &quot;the loser's club&quot; in order to get some protection from the school's  gang of bullies -Henry Bowers, Victor Criss and Belch Huggins. Unfortunately, the bullies are just the beginning of their problems. <BR> <BR>   The children start telling each other about encounters that they have had with Pennywise the clown, after Mike gives a class report that shows a drawing of Pennywise - The Dancing Clown -from the late 1880's. It turns out that Pennywise can shapechange into your deepest fear. Stan is terrified of werewolfs and when he first encounters Pennywise - it looks like a clown, but as he his backing away looking for a exit (since you normally don't encounter a clown outside the circus - and one that calls you by name from out of the shadows) he starts to see the clown change - hair on the arms, and then more and more like a werewolf as he glimpses behind him as he is being chased through the building. <BR> <BR>   After Richie's little brother is killed by Pennywise and other children disappear - the &quot;loser's club&quot; decide to enter the old town sewers and hunt down Pennywise themselves.... <BR>  <BR> I have read everything that Stephen King has written and I would have voted this to be his very best book except I was disappointed in the explanation of what the clown was at the very end of the book. But despite this I would still place this book in the top 5 of Stephen Kings best books - in the company of The Green Mile, The Stand, Christine, The Shining. <BR> <BR>	2000-11-27

Six months after the accidental death of his pregnant wife, John Kelly pulls over and picks up a young girl standing by the side of the road. Kelly falls in love with Pam as he helps nurse her back to help. Pam reveals that she was a teenage runaway that was made into a drug addict so that she would become a prostitute to make money for a group of drug dealers. Kelly wants to see who these people are and where they operate at, since he has friends on the police force in the city where Pam was a prostitute. As they are patrolling the neighborhood, they are spotted by the drug dealers. Kelly is shot and left for dead and Pam's body is found a few days later in a public park. Kelly decides to rid the city of the drug dealers his way - killing each of them with a different weapon so the police won't have a M.O. to go off of. <BR> <BR>	2000-11-22

Intense cat and mouse game !	<BR> When this book came out, the Kremlin ordered 500 copies!      The idea of a Soviet sub commander deciding to defect to the United States with his submarine was their deepest, darkest fear! The U.S. Navy and FBI also were very unhappy - they wanted to know who had been talking to Clancy - they couldn't believe that someone could find out all this by doing research. They were convinced that several people with Top Secret clearances had been talking to Clancy. <BR> <BR> The storyline is this: Marko Ramius is the Russian Navy's most experienced and highly decorated submarine commander, who has become disillusioned with the Communist Party. After seeing the plans for the newest Russian submarine - &quot;The Red October&quot;. A sub that is almost completely silent - a submarine with one purpose - &quot;to start a nuclear war&quot;. Ramius decides to steal the submarine with the help of the officers of his crew after he is assigned the command of The Red October. Before leaving port on it's madien run, Marius mails a letter to the Secretary of the Navy telling him of his intent to steal the sub. The letter arrives 2 days after the Red October sails from port. The Soviets in a panic, send their entire fleet in the region after it trying to find and sink the Red October. The Soviets approach the United States telling them that Marius sent a letter to the Secratary of the Navy explaining his intent to launch a nuclear attack against the United States, and ask for help in hunting the sub down and destroying it. <BR> <BR> Jack Ryan, currently a CIA analyst, who has written several books on naval warfare strategy, and who has met Marius at a diplomatic party, is asked to consult the President of the United States and the Chiefs of Staff at an emergency meeting. Jack mentions the possibility that the sub may be trying to defect. No one at the meeting believes it, but the President gives Jack permission to join up with an American sub on patrol and to attemp to make contactwith the Red October to find out what Marius intentions are. <BR> <BR>   This book really opened my eyes up to what our capabilities are with submarines - I had no idea how advanced they are. This story is very fast paced and intense. It really makes you wonder how the U.S. would respond under these circumstances.<BR> <BR> Great read!	2000-11-22

Why? Well this book tells you step by step, in layman's language, in exacting detail how you build a hydrogen bomb. About the only thing that is left out is the exact amount of plutonium you would need. This did not sit well with the powers that be and considered it to be an extreme threat to national security. Clancy's lawyers pointed out that all of this information is available to the general public in any college library if someone is willing to take the time to look it up. The court agreed and allowed the book to be published without any of the information being removed. <BR> <BR> The story starts during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. By then Israel had already secretly developed atomic weapons. Israel had a jet fighter loaded with an atomic bomb ready to scramble, the atomic bomb was not armed, but the plane was scrambled to go engage a group of tanks threatening the air base with the atomic bomb still attached. During the battle the plane was straffed with 50 caliber machine gun fire and the bomb mounts were hit, the bomb broke loose and came down in a farmers field. The jet crashed before it could limp home and the pilot was killed. Searches failed to locate the bomb. Flashforward, to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Communist scientists desperate for money sell detronium or &quot;heavy water&quot; to the palistinian terrorists allowing them to convert the atomic bomb to a hydrogen bomb. They decide that the Super Bowl will be the perfect target - since it is televised and the Vice Presedent of the United States has box tickets. <BR> <BR> You will be hanging by the edge of you seat waiting to see if they succeed.	2000-11-22

Watching the collapse of the social order of the United States is quite facinating - the President of the United States keeps denying that there is a problem as the government orders that cities be sealed off by Army and National Guard units to try to stop the spread of the plague. Barbed wire is set up around the perimeter of the cities and the soldiers have standing orders to shoot anyone attempting to leave and to burn their corpses with flamethrowers to prevent the spread of the disease.<BR> <BR> The survivors are having dreams. They are dreaming of an old black woman, &quot;Mother Abigale&quot; who is calling the good people to her shotgun shack in a cornfield in Kansas. People are also dreaming of &quot;the walking dude&quot; or Randal Flagg. Randal Flagg is very close to a demon and is recruiting most of the scientists (because they crave order and can't handle the chaos of collapse of civilization) and the evil people - calling on them to converge on Las Vegas. Randal Flagg's goal is to gather up most of the existing military hardware and then go wipe out the remaining survivors following Mother Abigale who are setting up shop in Boulder, Colorado.

This is a facinating book because it takes what you know about vampires and greatly expands on it because the story is told from the point of view of a vampire that wishes he wasn't a vampire!<BR> <BR> What makes the story facinating is that vampires make mortals into vampires so that they will have companionship down through the centuries. The vampires no longer have sex - although the act of drinking blood gives them intense hallucinogenic images from the victims life, which is as intimate and exciting as sex. <BR> <BR> BASIC STORY LINE: It has been 200 years since Louis was made into a vampire in New Orleans by Lestat. Louis was a rich plantation owner in New Orleans when it was under control of the French. Louis is stalked by Lestat and given the &quot;dark gift&quot;. After becoming a vampire Louis goes on a intense philosopical quest trying to find meaning in the universe. He wants to know when Satan is going to show up, since it is obvious to him that they are evil creatures. Lestat has a party mentality and tells Louis that he has been a vampire for over 500 years and he has never seen God or the devil and he could care less - he is having a great time. Fearing that Louis will leave him, Lestat makes a 12 year old girl that Louis was facinated with into a vampire. The kicker is this - you never age physically anymore once you are made into a vampire. Claudia doesn't really understand what has happened to her since she has the mind of a child. But as the years pass and she goes through puberty emotionally without any outlet and comes to realize that she is permanently trapped in a child's body she is filled with rage. <BR> <BR>   This is the background for one of the most facinating love triangles you will ever read. This book is a very complex and engrossing story. Try it!	2000-11-21

Excellent sequel !	<BR> About a third of this book is a retelling of Interview With the Vampire from Lestat's point of view. This series of books has done something that I have not experienced in any other book series - it turned me completely against a character in the first book and then later explained to me his motivations and viewpoint on events. When I finished Interview With the Vampire, I thought Lestat was the biggest asshole that ever walked on the face of the earth, but after having him tell his account of the relationship with Louis as he went along telling his story of how he was made into a vampire by Armand, made me understand why he acted the way he did. By the end, I was cheering for Lestat. <BR> <BR><br />   The story starts out in the late 1980's and Lestat is a rock star on MTV - everyone in the world thinks it is all an act - like Ozzy Ozbourne - so it is the perfect cover. We flash back to 18th century Paris - Lestat is a young French aristocrat, we then gradually move forward in time as Lestat's story unfolds to modern today. It is a facinating journey.	2000-11-21

You can't put this book down!	<BR> The background of the storyline is of a young boy, one of a large group, bred to be supergeniuses as Earth's last desperate attempt to find a military genius that can defeat an alien race that we are in an interstellar war with. Hundreds of planets and billions of humans have been lost and only Earth and a handful of planets remain. <BR> <BR> This is where Ender's story begins. <BR> <BR> Ender is sent into training doing battle simulation after battle simulation, against ever increasing, nearly impossible odds. Ender keeps finding ways to win the battles, but what makes the book impossible to put down is that the military officers in charge of Ender's training do everything in their power to socially isolate Ender from the other boys in the academy. And to top it all off they add the pyschological pressure of letting Ender know that time has ran out - Ender is humanity's last hope. There isn't time to find another child prodigy and train him - humanity has only a few precious months to finish training Ender and his fellow students and then the final battle will be waged to determine if humanity survives. <BR> <BR> <BR> SIDE NOTE:  Just to let you know how good this book is, I had a girlfriend that hadn't read more than 10 books of personal reading in her life when I met her. Over Christmas break from college, I told her that she should start reading Ender's Game, since she said she would as soon as Fall Quarter ended. She said that she just wanted to relax that evening and not have to do anything. Since I had found that no one can read the first 40 pages of this book and put it down, I turned off the tv and read the first 40 pages of the book to her. I then announced that I was going to bed and left the book on the coffee table in front of her. <BR>    I woke up the next morning to find her asleep on the couch with Ender's game in her lap. When she awoke, she had VERY RED eyes, and was upset that she couldn't ignore the book and stayed up until around 5 AM until she collapsed from exhaustion. She said that she was irritated that she wouldn't get any sleep that night either because she had to finish reading the book!	2000-11-11

If you enjoyed The Mote in God's Eye by Larry Niven, you will love this novel. Both are excellent first contact novels.  <BR> Warning! This is a very dark novel. If you like all sunshine and light, Walt Disney happy ending novels - this is not your type of book. <BR><br />The basic story line: Astronomers on earth have picked up signals from around Alpha Centauri, which turn out to be the most beautiful music humanity has ever heard. An expedition is sent out to make first contact with what must be intellegent life. <BR> <BR> This book is the surviors story, told in flashbacks. The story centers around a Jesuit priest, Father Emilio Sandoz, an expert linquist, who has lost his faith in God after being the only known survivor of an expedition that has gone horribly wrong. The expedition party members went out with the best of intentions, but because of misunderstanding of the vast cultural differences between them and their alien hosts, and disturbed by what they percieve as the explotation of one part of this alien society by another, they decide to assist the small group of aliens that they are living among for several months with improved food yields. This starts a chain of events with results that prove disasterous for themselves and the entire planet. <BR> <BR> This books operates on several levels and grapples with the issue of how does a person hold on to his faith in God and that everything in life that is experienced serves a higher purpose, when he is plunged into what seems to be an infinite amount of pain?	2000-11-10

Hyperion and the rest of the series is the best science fiction series yet written. I do not make this claim lightly. I have read alot of science fiction and the only books that I would say that come close are The Sparrow  by Maria Doria Russell and Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. Although  Across the Sea of Suns and the rest of the Galactic Center series by  Gregory Benford was another favorite.  <br />   Hyperion is one planet in a  large federation of planets which are at their political peak. This book is  the story of 7 people picked to go on a pilgramage to the time tombs on  Hyperion to see if they can figure out what is happening. The time tombs  are guarded by a creature called the Shrike. The Srike can move forward and  backward through time at will and seems to be invulnerable to any type of  weapon. The 7 people are strangers to each other, but they have on common  link, they have all encountered the Shrike before and been allowed to live.  There is a legend and even a cult religion that has grown up around the  Shrike for hundreds of years. It is said that the Shrike can grant any  wish. Pilgrims that go searching for the Shrike must travel in groups of  prime numbers or everyone will die. They must approach the time tombs on  foot or everyone will die. According to legend, the Shrike somehow  interviews everyone in the party if they have followed these rules and one  person will have their wish granted and all the other party members will be  killed. Also, the time tombs are moving backwards in time, and the fear is  that once the time tombs stop that a whole army of tens of thousands of  Shrikes will be unleashed. But this is just one thread in the vast tapestry  of the story which grows in complexity with each book. What is happening on  Hyperion is at the center of the collapse of this federation of thousands  of planets that is on the brink of collapse. It is a facinating tale.  <br />   Enjoy.	2000-07-21
