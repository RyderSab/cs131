Kirstie writes with a sharp wit and candor I found very entertaining. She jokes about herself and speaks with love & respect for her family, parents, and grandparents.<br /><br />Her food & weight issues are mentioned often. I really loved the story about her Grandfather paying her a dollar to spend Saturday night, watching the fights with him on TV, serving the then 6 year old Kirstie lightly salted beer in a \\"thimble\\" sized shot glass. I'm glad I bought this book so I can reread it whenever I want.	2005-04-29

The energy the author has mentally and physically shows just how young he really is to be a \\"single parent\\" to his younger brother after the death of both his parents. My favorite parts are when he tries to go out for an evening or other times he gets worried about his little brother and can not enjoy himself and tortures himself with an inner dialouge from Hell.

There are a lot of reviews about this book, but I had to write one too because this book is a masterpiece! The people who say they didn't like the ending probably feel that way only because the author gets to choose who  lives and who dies. The reader loves the characters so much that they are  mad &amp; grieve when a favorite is killed off. But this was the Civil  War!  No soldier or American went without wounds. This is a book you will  LOVE!  I am glad I read it, bought it and I hope my review leads you  to do the same!  You'll be missing much if you never read Cold Mountain.

Seeing it all, enjoying the mystery and magic of exotic places, people, and small joys she finds along the way. She loses me  when she preaches her own liberal doctrine to us readers. Her politics are  hard to stomach and are so idealistic...it's plain to see the author is a  life long &quot;tree-hugger&quot; from the 60s. Fine for her, but I think  her opinions should be left out of the book. When she just tells us what  she sees and what she enjoys about it...we as readers and happy...we don't  care why you left the USA.

Andrews herself wrote it and you don't want to miss this one! I find myself reading it again and again over the years. The story is haunting, mysterious, and full of interesting characters. In  recent years, Andrew's books have been written by someone else...but this  book was penned while Andrews was still alive and has her skillful writing  in it &amp; you get hooked into the story. Sensual, cruel and dowdy women  can't keep Audrina from the truth about herself. Reminds me of a Stephen  King book, except not so long and from a female point of view.	2000-01-16

One room school house, the changing of the seasons and the farm chores for each one...a memior of one man's boyhood experiences. I liked this book and my husband liked it even more than I did. He was born and raised in rural  WI, picking rocks, milking, and going sledding with his brothers. This book  is well written and reads like a time capsule...the people &amp; chores on  a family farm. I would have given it a perfect 5 stars, but there is too  much about bees. Less bee watching and the author would have a classic  here. Great that his story goes full circle. We learn what happens to the  people we've read and cared about...which is always gratifying to us  readers.	2000-01-16

I felt like I had 1000 pages read by the end. The end is so wierd, but then all of Morrison's novels are out of the ordinary, odd, and dark.

This book has nothing to savor in it's story. I don't like the Mother, who is never  true to herself. I really disliked the older daughter character, she needs  to grow-up and since she is 40 I doubt she ever will.

He tells the tales of his tragic  childhood with candor, an eye for detail, humor &amp; yes, some hope too. I  bought this book and have read it through twice, then loaned it out to all  my friends who read books with an open mind. The world needed to hear this  memoir. I applaud Frank McCourt.

I am a fan of Alice Kooper's music and I thought, great, I'll read his memoirs. Wrong. He is no writer. I thought such an interesting life would be interesting to read. Well, maybe if a real good author penned it, it  could have been. Plus, he admits to being stoned on all manner of drugs (  except herione, as if that makes a big difference ) and booze, then expects  us readers to take him at his word about his past. I think he is fuzzy at  best about his past. Name dropping is his favorite past time...*Yawn*.  Spend your money on a CD...enjoy the music. I doubt you will like this  book. I didn't.	2000-01-13

Their life &amp; times, trials &amp; stamina through the Depression, war(s), and raising families. I wish an author with a bit of distance and vision would  have done the actual writing of this book. As it is, Brokaw cannonizes his  subjects and does a poor job telling the real story. I hope this topic gets  explored further by someone other than Brokaw, who has little talent as a  writer. I was very disappointed reading this book and I made the mistake of  buying gift copies for my elderly war vet friend &amp; neighbors, and my  own Father without pre-reading it.
