Anti-nativism is the view that complex behaviors are virtually always the product of complex epigenetic dynamics. Stephen Pinker is a prime example of a nativist, and Blumberg of a passionate anti-nativist.<br /><br />The debate between these two positions has a long intellectual lineage, and there is no sign of a let-up, despite the huge increase in our understanding of the brain and of developmental processes in the past quarter century. Each side has executed seeming deadly thrusts against the other, only to see the other bounce back, better armed then ever.<br /><br />When a scientific dispute such as this leads such an extended existence, one suspects that there is a reinterpretation in which each is correct. Such was the case, for instance, in the ancient debate about the wave vs. particle nature of light.<br /><br />Blumberg's strongest anti-nativist thrust in this book is the story of several dramatic claims by nativists that human infants, without experience, are primed to mimic facial movements, to understand basic physical laws, and to have the concept of number. Blumberg's account of the evidence against these nativist views is quite persuasive.<br /><br />Blumberg does not closely analyze what is perhaps the most compelling case for a nativist behavior in humans: the structure of language. This nativist argument that human language as genetically encoded, a view that goes back to Chomsky in the mid-Twentieth century, is treated by Blumberg in a perfunctory and uncompelling manner. Blumberg explains the evidence that there is a \\"universal grammar\\" (UG) exhibited by all known languages and learned rapidly by children in all but the most deprived environments, by saying that all current languages are offshoots of a single \\"primordial\\" language spoken by our common ancestors. There is certainly no evidence of such a primordial language, and to assert this is the sort of \\"just-so\\" reasoning that Blumberg rightly criticizes. Blumberg claims that language creates linguistic capability developmentally, which would be at least plausible were the primordial language argument correct. But, it is not. Moreover, Blumberg does not even mention the many cases in which societies without language (e.g., deaf children who never learned sign language, or a mixture of ethnicities that use a pidgin discourse that does not conform to the UG, and is indeed much more primitive) develop a UG-conformant language within a generation. There are certainly linguists who agree with Blumberg's anti-nativist position on language, but I believe Blumberg sides with this minority view simply to present a united anti-nativist position.<br /><br />A possible way to adjudicate the differences between nativists and their opponents is to assert that the nativist's \\"normal environment\\" may itself be a complex product of interaction between developing individuals and the epigenetic structures they face as well as create. A close, fine-grained look at the emergence of complex behaviors thus follows the epigenetic models, while a coarser look fits the nativist preconception. This view is very likely in the case of language, and may apply in many other cases. Nativists should be comfortable with this adjudication, and it appears to me to satisfy the criticism of the anti-nativists.<br /><br />The nail in the coffin of nativism would be the verification that in many or most cases, there are novel environments that allow organisms to develop extremely novel, yet fitness-enhancing behaviors, through learning and/or adjustment of population gene frequencies. I believe this probably false for most species, but is the case for some complex human traits, and perhaps for some traits in non-human primates (behavior in captivity, for instance, may be very different that in the wild for somespecies).<br /><br />One of the most dramatic applications of nativism to humans is the Evolutionary Psychology notion, promoted by Pinker, David Buss, and many others, that contemporary humans have an advanced technological environment, but are still possessed of a \\"stone-age mind\\" that prevents us from achieving our most cherished ethical ideals. While there may be some complex human behaviors that fit this description,  mostly likely most do not. This does not mean, however, that the \\"blank slate\\" view of the human mind, bitterly criticized  by Lida Cosmides, John Tooby, Stephen Pinker, and other evolutionary psychologists, is in the least bit plausible. It is not. The fact that there may be different environments that elicit (through a dynamic exchange of genetic and epigenetic forces) novel behaviors does not mean that for every behavior, there is an environment that will elicit that behavior.<br /><br />To this outsider (I am an economist, not a psychologist), the extremely primitive level at which this debate is carried out is indicative of the primitive state of modern cognitive psychology. The brain is an exceedingly complex piece of nature and modern psychology has an exceedingly primitive understanding of its functioning.  Studying modern psychology, one learns many facts and gains many insights. But, there is no theory there, and there is no theory on the horizon at the present moment, despite fMRI and other new techniques for probing the physiology of thought. In the absence of a common theory to which we all adhere by force of its explanatory value, we have the sort of tempests in a teapot exhibited by the nativist/anti-nativist controversy.ons of nativism to humans is the Evolutionary Psychology notion, promoted by Pinker, David Buss, and many others, that contemporary humans have an advanced technological environment, but are still possessed of a \\"stone-age mind\\" that prevents us from achieving our most cherished ethical ideals.

The arguments are weak and will certainly fail to convince most \\"conservatives\\" to embrace Darwinian evolutionary theory.<br /><br />Evolutionary biology is scientifically correct, which is the main reason it must be accepted by anyone, whatever their political philosophy (Arnhart does not stress this). However, Darwinian biology can be either used or ignored in making political arguments, so I will rephrase the issue as: are there good arguments flowing from evolutionary biology for conservative political philosophy?<br /><br />We must note that at least in the USA, there are two quite different branches of conservativism, one espousing religious fundamentalism and the other classical economic liberalism. They have almost nothing in common intellectually and are simply politically linked by historical events. Arnhart does not stress this point.<br /><br />Arnhart's arguments directed towards religious conservatism can be summarized as: (a) evolutionary biology is compatible with belief in God; (b) evolutionary biology recognizes and reinforces the notion that religious belief is a universal element of human nature; and (c) a strong adherence to family values is part of human nature. I agree with these statements, but Arnhart never addresses the burning issues, which include abortion, homosexuality, gay marriage, and state-religion separation. He does deal with intelligent design, which he rejects as a scientific theory. This is in part why I call his book \\"disingenuous:\\" he simply avoids the hard topics.<br /><br />Turning to classical liberalism, Arnhart says that Darwinian evolution supports a Burkean political philosophy. I think this is a plausible argument, although Arnhart avoids all the hard questions by choosing as the alternative political philosophy an absurd caricature of the leftist alternative that is more or less 19th century Utopianism. Societies grow organically, Arnhart says, and cannot be socially engineered using the principles of Reason alone. Of course this is correct, but this is accepted by all relevant political philosophers today (except Peter Singer and his bizarre ilk). What about the proper extent of government, the treatment of poverty, the environment, and foreign relations? Nothing here.<br /><br />I am not a conservative, and I don't think much of conservative political philosophy, but if I were, I would not be moved by Arnhart's arguments (I am also not a liberal, by the way, and in fact I think the liberal/conservative dichotomy is a sick joke, but that's a topic for another day...)19th century Utopianism.

Gillian Brown is a primatologist who studies parenting behavior. Their book is a study of six strands of evolutionary theory as applied to human behavior: (a) Darwin and his pre-sociobiology followers (including Galton, Spencer, Lorenz, Tinbergen, von Frisch, and Ardrey); (b) the founders of sociobiology, including Dawkins, Trivers, Hamilton, Maynard Smith, and E. O. Wilson; and three offshoots of sociobiology, (c) behavioral ecology (including Hill, Kaplan, Hawkes, and Chagnon); (d) evolutionary psychology (including Cosmides, Tooby, Daly, Margo Wilson, Pinker, Buss); (e) memetics; and (f) gene-culture coevolution (including Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, Boyd and Richerson, and Laland himself).<br /><br />The title is inspired by the authors' impression that, despite the fact that the academic social sciences have virtually ignored evolutionary approaches, the public finds them very sexy and provocative, to the point where evolutionary research is continually influenced by political and journalistic concerns, and the science tends to be overwhelmed by the junk and the hype. I fully share this impression, and I think they have done a fine job in extracting the \\"sense\\" from the \\"nonsense.\\" They even manage to treat memetics seriously, despite the fact that memetics' attempt to detach culture from reproduction, production, cooperation, conflict, and the other basic activities of social life cannot possibly succeed.<br /><br />Laland and Brown vigorously defend the early Darwinists and sociobiologists against the many politically motivated attacks against them (they do not deal with religious critiques). While the authors recognize that their ideas have often eclipsed by more contemporary research, they find no major fault in the constitution of these two schools. I think this is a bad mistake. In the century from Darwin to E. O. Wilson, evolutionary researchers managed to isolate themselves from every mainstream social science, including economics, sociology, psychology, political science, and to a lesser extent, anthropology. It is futile to blame this on the mainstream. The fault lies squarely with the evolutionary theorists, who failed to make a convincing case for the position.<br /><br />This is quite unforgivable, because mainstream social science has made many central contributions that must be integrated into evolutionary theory to provide a solid, scientific body of knowledge concerning human behavior. Laland and Brown give no reason for this isolation of evolutionary theory, except the trivial commonplaces mouthed by virtually everyone in this tradition (traditional social science is ideology, the mainstream is afraid of being tainted with the sins of eugenics and racist genetic determinism, and so on). The major problem facing evolutionary theory today is not to shuck the nonsense, but to account for its failure to become part of the mainstream, I believe, and Laland and Brown do not recognize this.<br /><br />The very idea of forming schools of thought, such as behavioral ecology, evolutionary psychology, and gene-culture coevolution is an indication of the inability of evolutionary theory to consider itself a science. Scientists seek integration, not fragmentation. Behavioral ecologists, for instance, are anthropologists who study simple societies, while evolutionary psychologists are psychologists who study commonalities in human behavior across all societies. How could they possibly consider themselves \\"alternative\\" theories? They very idea is absurd, a capitulation to the natural human tendency to congregate in small groups of \\"insiders\\" whose major motivation is to triumph over the many groups of \\"outsiders\\" whose strange ways are threatening and unsettling.<br /><br />This one issue aside, I find Laland and Brown very convincing in adjudicating among the various approaches, and in their plea for tolerance and exchange of information among them. Like the authors, I believe that gene-culture coevolution is the overarching principle that includes the others as subclasses. I also believe that gene-culture coevolution is the most promising basis for the integration of evolutionary with mainstream social science. The authors' only critique of gene-culture coevolution is that it tends to be highly mathematical and does not generate many empirical studies. I do not agree with this critique. Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, as well as Boyd and Richerson, have done admirable empirical work, and with the use of experimental game theory in recent years, we will have much more such research in the near future. The true critique of gene-culture coevolutionary theory, in my view, is its ignorance of and contempt for traditional social science. Unless this is overcome, evolutionary social theory will remain marginalized for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />Of course, most potential readers of this book will have the same prejudices concerning the traditional disciplines as do the authors, and they should find this book a welcome and incisive corrective to the disarray within evolutionary social theory.issue aside, I find Laland and Brown very convincing in adjudicating among the various approaches, and in their plea for tolerance and exchange of information among them.

The various chapter are complementary and there is little disagreement among authors. As such, this volume might well represent something like a generally accepted orthodoxy, laid out by some of the most senior members of the behavioral science research community. For this alone the volume is well worth reading.<br /><br />Audrey R. Chapman received a Ph.D. in public law and government from Columbia University and graduate degrees in theology and ethics from New York Theological Seminary and Union Theological Seminary. She has been extremely active in promoting fundamental human rights around the world, and works closely with the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Robert W. Sussman is a distinguished primatologist at Washington University in St. Louis, and is a specialist in the ecology and social structure of primates.<br /><br />The editors take the \\"sociobiology/evolutionary psychology\\" model of human behavior as the \\"dominant paradigm\\" and consider their collective intervention as a counterweight to this dominant paradigm. In his summing up at the book's conclusion, for instance, theologian Stephen J. Pope asserts: \\"The primate studies traced in this book offer a helpful alternative to the dominant paradigm. If other primates are prone to social behavior more often than antisocial behavior, perhaps pity, empathy, and other prosocial feelings do not have to be laid on top of a substrate that is essentially antisocial.\\" (p. 329).<br /><br />What is the \\"dominant paradigm?\\" The editors make this clear in the first half dozen pages of their introductory essay (pp. 3-9). \\"Sociobiology...offers a radically selfish and individuals account of human nature...In the sociobiology account, human beings are ethical solely to because morality is a strategy to promote self-interest.\\" The offenders include Richard Dawkins, Robert Wright, Mark Ridley, Michael Ruse, E. O. Wilson and Richard Wrangham.<br /><br />In effect, we here have a replay of the age-old debate in political philosophy between the \\"romantics\\" like J. J. Rousseau and Karl Marx on the one side, and the \\"conservatives\\" on the other, including the Hobbes of Leviathan, the Adam Smith of Wealth of Nations, as well as modern academic disciplines of biology and economics. Indeed, it is curious that prominent economists are not included among the \\"dominant paradigm's\\" proponents. Nor is mention made of John Tooby and Lida Cosmides, Steven Pinker, David Buss, and the other prominent proponents of Evolutionary Psychology. Nor is it surprising that the proponents of the \\"alternative view\\" are mainly anthropologists and theologians---the romantic wing of the behavioral sciences---rather than biologists and economists, who form the conservative wing.<br /><br />There are several fine essays in this volume, far more than I have room to discuss here. Christopher Boehm's work on chimp and hunter-gatherer human societies is among the most important contributions in recent decades. Elinor Ostrom never ceases to have interesting observations to make. Irving Bernstein's analysis of conflict management in primate societies is refreshing, and his notion of the \\"social bond\\" as a primate psychological characteristic that accounts for much sociality is interesting and under-recognized. Even individual sentences sometimes are pregnant with meaning. For instance, Watanabe and Smuts note that \\"language...has transformed human sociality into highly semioticized encounters of intention and meaning that nonetheless depend on contingently negotiated conventions of trust and truth.\\" (p. 305).<br /><br />The weakness ofthe volume is the same as its strength---its intention to provide an \\"alternative\\" to the dominant paradigm. The dominant paradigm is not wholly wrong, and there is no place for a complete \\"alternative\\" to this paradigm. There is need for balance and integration. Neither the editors nor most of the chapter authors recognize this. The following terms, for instance, are not analyzed in the book, and do not appear in the Index: punishment, ostracism, jealousy, spite, shame, guilt and revenge. By contrast, \\"empathy\\" appears seven times and \\"fairness\\" appears twelve times in the Index. In a sense, this book is sociobiology (vintage Dawkins) turned on its head.<br /><br />Surely the editors do not believe that there is war, racism, and genocide because people believe in the sociobiological model of human nature proposed by Dawkins et al. Surely they do not believe that if an august and prestigious group academics proclaims that human nature is basically good, or even if this were to become the dominant paradigm, there would be no more war, racism, and genocide. Surely they must understand that both cooperation, love and empathy emerge under certain circumstances and conflict, hatred, and malevolence emerge under others. The question is to understand the nature of these circumstances and how they may be controlled in such manner as to bring about socially desirable outcomes. This requires a rejection of the romantic vs. conservative dichotomy in favor of something involving the ineluctable duality of human nature.<br /><br />One such approach of this type is described in Herbert Gintis, Samuel Bowles, Robert Boyd and Ernst Fehr, Moral Sentiments and Material Interests: On the Foundations of Cooperation in Economic Life (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2005). We argue for a concept of \\"strong reciprocity\\" according to which people are naturally predisposed to cooperated towards meeting common needs, but also naturally predisposed to punish free riders and other norm violators, even when neither cooperation or punishment is in the individual's personal material self-interest. We show how the behavior manifests itself by using the results of behavioral game theory and laboratory experiments with human subjects, we show how this may have evolved in our long evolutionary prehistory as a species, and we apply the notion towards understanding such contemporary phenomena as managing the commons, analyzing the welfare state, the role of fairness in wage determination, the role of reciprocity in the law, and other arenas of cooperation and conflict. My web site has lots of other papers and books devoted to a dual model of human nature.<br /><br />One of the most effective ways that humans cooperate is in sacrificing for one's group in conflict with other groups. This strong \\"insider-outsider\\" psychology is doubtless the product of our long evolutionary history divided into small groups of hunter-gatherers who periodically were forced to fight for valuable resources. The same psychology that allows us to build castles, epic poems, and the modern welfare state also allows us to kill others with great effectiveness, and often with great glee. We need more research resources dedicated to understanding how our capacity for love and sacrifice can so easily turn into orgies of mass murder and genocide. We do not need that much more devoted to showing that some old-fashioned, one-sided, notion of human nature is better than some other old-fashioned, one-sided, notion of human nature./>The weakness of the volume is the same as its strength---its intention to provide an \\"alternative\\" to the dominant paradigm.

US	53051169	R2LLKTK71UHT4O	0262025795	5176584	Adapting Minds: Evolutionary Psychology and the Persistent Quest for Human Nature (Bradford Books)	Books	4	106	132	N	Y	Worth a serious reading	David Buller, a philosopher, has written a book critiquing the scientific work of a subgroup of evolutionary psychologists who adhere to a doctrine first clearly articulated in a series of brilliant articles and books by D. Symons, L. Cosmides and J. Tooby. Their work was immeasurably enhanced by its uptake by popular science writers R. Wright and S. Pinker.<br /><br />I think the philosophy of science is quite important, but I cannot think of a case where philosophers, qua philosophers, have added anything substantive to the critique of a scientific theory. I read this book only because of the extravagant praise afforded it by prominent behavioral scientists, including David Sloan Wilson, Linnda Caporeal, and Kim Sterelny. While I think this book does have a lot to offer the interested lay reader, it certainly does not violate my generalization about the worthlessness of philosophers criticizing scientific theories.<br /><br />The author is clear in stating that his contribution is not a critique of evolutionary psychology in general, but only of this particular subgroup, which he distinguishes by capitalizing the name. For a general description of evolutionary psychology and Evolutionary Psychology (which I call EvPsych), please see my review of Scher and Rauscher, Evolutionary Psychology.<br /><br />Much of Buller's effort goes to criticizing a few prominent examples of the empirical research of EvPsychers, including D. Buss's analysis of mate preference, M. Daly and M. Wilson's analysis of parenting vs. step-parenting, and C. Cosmides and J. Tooby's analysis of cheater detection modules. I think this was an unfortunate choice because the general EvPsych approach does not stand or fall on these examples in any way. Despite Buller's strong critique of Daly and Wilson, I suspect that their data analysis will emerge superior to Buller's, if only because they are consummate professionals in the area and he is a rank amateur. But, either way, their predictions do not depend in any way on the particular doctrines of EvPsych, but are broadly based on the evolutionary psychology paradigm. Buss's analysis of mate choice is impressively broad-based and thorough, but he has not been able to show that his results are due to EEA adaptations as opposed to strong cultural uniformities across societies, based on male dominance of modern political and economic hierarchies. Cosmides and Tooby's analysis of cheater detection modules is directly related to a major EvPsych proposition (the modularity of mind), but the only people convinced by their cheater detection argument are themselves and their disciples.<br /><br />In dealing with the theoretical basis of EvPsych, Buller is very successful only one point, albeit a major one: the existence and nature of mental modules. His success is based on a highly cogent critique of the EvPsych position that the human mind is composed of a set of distinct, complexly organized and independent modules, each of which evolved as a solution to a particular evolutionary challenge to our species. The critique, however, is not philosophical but scientific, based on the work of contemporary developmental neurobiologists. This is perhaps the best part of the book.<br /><br />Buller also critiques somewhat effectively the notion that there has been little development in the human gene pool, vis-&agrave;-vis mental development, in the past 50,000 years, and hence that we possess \\"stone-age minds.\\" The arguments Buller uses are plausible, and take the form of noting that genetic change is much faster in many cases than assumed by the EvPsychers. Nevertheless, this point has not been nailed down by population biologists or quantitative geneticists, as far as I know.<br /><br />Buller also deploys the argument that there was no single EEA, and hence there is no basis for the notion that human nature is homogeneous. This is a correct, but well-known argument. Only the EvPsychers themselves stick adamantly to the Orthodoxy on this point.<br /><br />Doubtless the least effect part of this book is Buller's extended attempt to deny that there is a such thing as \\"human nature.\\" Borrowing an argument from Hull, he asserts that species are \\"individuals\\" rather than \\"natural kinds\\" and only \\"natural kinds\\" have the sort of being that allows us to discuss their \\"nature.\\"  This, to my mind, is exactly the type of philosophizing that renders the philosophical critique of science so bizarre and ineffective. Ducks have duck nature. It is what we learn when we study the character and behavior of ducks. Mosquitoes similarly have mosquito nature. Humans being are no different. The philosopher is not allowed to define the terms of science in his own bizarre way and then claim to have detected a synthetic a priori inconsistency in the scientific use of the term.<br /><br />In short, I do not believe this book is an important contribution to the development of evolutionary psychology or to the critique of EvPsych, although it is a great introduction to the literature for an interested lay person, since Buller develops his themes carefully and lucidly, never leaving even the most uninstructed reader behind.o the Orthodoxy on this point. <br />  <br />Doubtless the least effect part of this book is Buller's extended attempt to deny that there is a such thing as \\"human nature.\\" Borrowing an argument from Hull, he asserts that species are \\"individuals\\" rather than \\"natural kinds\\" and only \\"natural kinds\\" have the sort of being that allows us to discuss their \\"nature.\\"  This, to my mind, is exactly the type of philosophizing that renders the philosophical critique of science so bizarre and ineffective.

Evolutionary psychology attempts to use this fact to understand the human brain's particular capacities and limitations. Evolutionary psychology has provided many key insights into human behavior. First, since the human brain is extremely costly to nurture and maintain, its general contribution to human fitness must be high, and hence the brain must be an adaptation to the particular conditions under which our species evolved. Therefore, understanding these conditions may shed strong light on human psychology. Second, the human brain's information processing capacities are likely to be closely associated with the particular adaptive needs of our species, rather than being a simple, general purpose information processor. Thus, rather than being infinitely malleable, humans are predisposed to behave in certain ways in the sense that under a very broad range of environmental conditions some behaviors will be virtually universally exhibited and others will be extremely rare, while behaviors to which we are not predisposed will be exhibited either not at all, or only in a very restricted set of environmental circumstances. In short, evolutionary psychology holds that a consideration of our evolutionary history is extremely powerful in generating plausible hypotheses concerning human psychology that can be tested using the standard tools of experimental research.<br /><br />Those who reject evolutionary psychology in the general form stated above are generally either ill-informed or have a political or religious agenda that clouds their scientific judgment. Creationists, for instance, cannot accept evolutionary psychology. Nor can Marxists or extreme cultural determinists, for whom human nature either does not exist, or takes the form of infinite cultural malleability.<br /><br />Evolutionary psychology, then, is simply one more tool (albeit an unusually powerful tool) in the behavioral scientist's repertoire. However, a small but highly creative and extremely influential group of evolutionary psychologists, including D. Buss, J. Tooby, L. Cosmides, D. Symons, S. Pinker have constructed a version of evolutionary psychology that includes key assertions that are highly contentious and many believe are incorrect. These thinkers appear to many scientists (myself included) to form a sort of scientific cult: they always agree with each other, they reject any outside criticism, their message never changes, and they recruit by directly training new members rather than having their ideas accepted by the general scientific community. To distinguish this group from evolutionary psychology in general, I will call their doctrine EvPsych (the book under review calls them \\"narrow\\" evolutionary psychologists, a particularly poor choice of words, since they are anything but narrow, and Kluwer, the bureaucratic and infinitely stuffy publisher, true to form, insists on an identically worded disclaimer at the head of each chapter of book, saying that by \\"narrow\\" they do not mean \\"narrow.\\")<br /><br />EvPsychers believe that (a) human culture is an effect of human genetics, and culture explains nothing important concerning human behavior; (b) human behavior in general is an adaptation to the specific conditions of the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation (EEA) in which our species emerged from other hominid species; (c) the human brain is a highly modular organ, each module having emerged to solve a particular evolutionary problem; (d) for this reason, the human brain lacks all the characteristics of a general information processor, and cannot solve any problems other than those that challenged our existence in our dim evolutionary past. In particular, we are doomed to apply old, generally ineffective, methods to the solution of new problems. This is the tragedy of the human condition.<br /><br />EvPsych is wrong in each of the above assertions, and everyone knows this exceptthe EvPsychers themselves. Moreover, they have hindered the general integration of evolutionary psychology into the repertoire of behavioral science with their tendentious and outlandish claims. The book under review is an important contribution towards restoring evolutionary psychology to its rightful place in the behavioral sciences. It's main attraction is that the editors, Steven Scher and Fredrick Rauscher, recognize that the best critique is a cogent alternative, and this is exactly what the various chapter of the book provide for us. I do not have the space to comment on each of the thirteen chapters, but a few prominent themes emerge.<br /><br />First, several authors challenge the coarse-grained modularity assumption of EvPsych, using our contemporary neuroscientific and developmental knowledge of the structure of the brain. This includes especially stunning contributions of Steven Quarts, William Bechtel, and Jennifer Mundale. These authors present the state of the art understanding of the neurological development of the human brain from embryo to adult form, and argue for a \\"developmental evolutionary psychology\\" in which the brain has a fine-grained modularity that results from the dynamic interaction between organism and environment during growth and maturation of the individual.<br /><br />Second, several authors challenge the \\"gene-centered\\" view of evolution, which the EvPsychers borrowed from Dawkins, Hamilton, Wilson and other biologists who dominated evolutionary theory in the 1960's and 1970's. Thus Linnda Caporeal argues for \\"repeated assembly,\\" which is a form of what is commonly known as gene-culture coevolution, and David Sloan Wilson points out the errors in reasoning that lead gene-centered theorists to reject truly altruistic (other-regarding) behavior in humans. Sarah Blaffer Hrdy exposes the sexual stereotypes of the gene-centered approach by reviewing the evidence on female mate choice.<br /><br />Several chapters are philosophically-motivated critiques of EvPsych. I do not believe that philosophers ever contribute by criticizing scientific theories, and I think my view is confirmed by this book.<br /><br />I quite recommend this book to those who are new to the field. There is some excellent material here. A major drawback is the publisher, Kluwer.

Like every great theory, the Grand Synthesis has had its prominent critics, but most of the charges laid against it have failed to take root. By the 1970's and 1980's such critics were widely dismissed as crackpots and minds were closed against their ideas.<br /><br />Subtitling their 1995 book \\"The Lamarckian Dimension\\" was about as in-your-face a flaunt on orthodoxy imaginable, and I was surprised that the book turned out to be quite a credible review of our understanding of epigenetic inheritance. Their new book is on the same topic, but is much more considerate of the reader, mature, and self-assured than the author's previous foray.<br /><br />Genetic (DNA), epigenetic (non-DNA chemical), behavioral (learning/assimilating), and symbolic (language, theory) information transmission are important in many levels of biological organization, from the structure of the cell to the social organization of masses of ants and humans. This much was clearly laid out in a number of recent books, including those of Maynard Smith and Szathmary, Keller, Michod, Durham, Boyd and Richerson, and others. But, this book is unique in being both accessible to the interest lay reader and having great breadth, covering many of the important levels in \\"multi-level selection.\\"<br /><br />I remember the first time it hit me that the problem of regulating the behavior of errant cells in a multi-cellular organism is the same, in principle, as regulating the behavior of an individual member of a social species. I also remember clearly when it first occurred to me that all of evolutionary theory consists of models of information transmission and behavior modification across time. Both of these are well illustrated in this book, sometimes in an almost poetic manner.<br /><br />It is common for objectors to the Grand Synthesis to have some ideological agenda, such a Marxism, Post-Modernism, or Transcendental Holism, to put in the place of evolutionary theory. It is a great relief to find authors who express the new age of evolutionary biology without falling into these common traps. It just tells the truth, unembellished, but with a light tone.br />It is common for objectors to the Grand Synthesis to have some ideological agenda, such a Marxism, Post-Modernism, or Transcendental Holism, to put in the place of evolutionary theory.

Wilson's call for a unification of biology and the social sciences some three decades ago, and despite the hostility still aroused by the notion of \\"sociobiology\\" by some traditionalists, the process of integrating social science into natural science appears to be in full swing. Paul Seabright's new book is a welcome and important contribution to this process.<br /><br />The idea behind sociobiology is that there are many social species, and our understanding of ourselves will be enhanced by analyzing the similarities and differences between human and non-human social systems. The main title of Seabright's book, \\"In the Company of Strangers\\" isolates a unique characteristic of human sociality: while several species evolved a highly complex and decentralized division of labor, humans are the only species with extensive cooperation among unrelated individuals.<br /><br />The maturation of sociobiology since E. O. Wilson's call to arms has included several key strands of research. One is a broadened concept of sociality, in which it is recognized that from the emergence of multi-cellular organisms to the rise of Homo sapiens, major evolutionary transitions have required novel mechanisms facilitating the cooperation among the complex parts of biological wholes. It is now routine, for instance, to note that the disciplining of an aberrant cell in an organism, an ovipositing worker in a bee hive, and a shirking worker in a business enterprise are modeled in a similar manner. A second contribution is gene-culture coevolutionary theory, important because human sociality has been far more cultural than that of any other species.<br /><br />Seabright's book exemplifies a new breed of economic analysis, seeking answers to fundamental question wherever they are best found, ignoring disciplinary boundaries. A transdisciplinary approach to economics life is nothing new. Adam Smith, for instance, not only wrote The Wealth of Nations, but also The Moral Sentiments, which is perhaps the greatest work of psychology prior to William James. But this tradition was all but buried in the early years of the Twentieth century, only recently to be rediscovered.<br /><br />Seabright provides elementary, but nonetheless richly fascinating, introductions to such standard economic topics as the division of labor, prices, money, and firms, and addresses such perennial economic problems as unemployment, poverty, environmental destruction, and economic instability. The novelty is that he consistently does so from a long-run evolutionary perspective. This is decidedly not a book on economic policy. Even such traditionally central questions as capitalism versus socialism, the balance between competition and regulation, and the distribution of wealth and income are mentioned only in passing.<br /><br />The innovation in this book lies in its treatment of the psychological prerequisites of modern economic life. As Seabright notes, \\"[M]odern society is an opportunistic experiment, founded on a human psychology that had already evolved before human beings ever had to deal with strangers in any systematic way.\\" (p. 4) This psychology has two elements, one of which is well known and the other relatively novel in behavioral science. The well known is what Seabright calls \\"rational calculation,\\" by which he means a capacity for logical reasoning, information processing, and technique mastery that far exceeds that of any other of Earth's creatures. The novel is what he calls \\"reciprocity,\\" which is \\"the willingness to repay kindness with kindness and betray with revenge, even when this is not what rational calculation would recommend.\\" (p. 27)<br /><br />Two terminological issues are important to set straight from the outset. First, by \\"reciprocity\\" Seabright means what has been called \\"strong reciprocity\\" (Bowles and Gintis, Nature 415 Jan 2002). The \\"strong\\" adjective is meant to distinguish the behavior from the self-interested notion of reciprocity common in the biological literature. Second, Seabright follows a long tradition in economics of considering reciprocity to be non-rational, using the term \\"rational\\" when one means \\"caring only about oneself\\" as though the terms were synonymous. There is nothing \\"irrational\\" about such other-regarding elements of strong reciprocity as returning kindness with kindness and retaliating against someone who has harmed one, even when these behaviors involve net material costs.<br /><br />Seabright's treatment of human society is innovatory because both biologists and economists have long maintained both that humans are selfish when dealing with non-kin, and their cooperation can be explained by long-term self-interest. Moreover, there is a long tradition, especially on the Left, of faulting capitalism for promoting greed and selfishness, which is at best a partial truth, since market economies at least tolerate, and probably promote, strong reciprocity. Experimental economics, as described by Seabright, has shown that most people are indeed reciprocal and in fact neither economic nor biological models of self-interested cooperation are rarely plausible when they involve groups of more than a few individuals.<br /><br />Seabright also analyzes the \\"dark side\\" of strong reciprocity, which is the tendency to exhibit hostility to \\"outsiders\\" in the name of \\"insider\\" cooperation. \\"Cooperation within a group,\\" he observes, \\"can make the group more lethally aggressive in its dealing with outsiders... [the] systematic killing of unrelated individuals is so common among human beings that... it cannot be described as exceptional, pathological, or disturbed.\\" (pp. 209,53). He concludes that \\"what Adam Smith famously described as the human propensity to 'truck, barter and exchange' has always coexisted uneasily with a rival temptation to take, bully, and extort.\\" (p. 233).<br /><br />This book is highly readable and will be accessible to a wide audience. It is, however, weak on details, eschews formal model building and extended analytical argumentation, and hence will serve only as a stepping-stone to the field for those interested in the economy as a dynamically evolving system.om the self-interested notion of reciprocity common in the biological literature.

There is no doubt but that very many investors hold erroneous notions of the dynamics of price movements, and having a correct understanding will, on average lead to better returns on one's portfolio. Sheffrin presents the evidence for this position in an interesting and accessible manner.<br /><br />Shefrin's main advice for investors is absolutely correct, and would improve the asset positions of many poor souls with idiotic notions of stock dynamics. His advice is that if you are not a gifted and dedicated stock expert, you should invest in a low-maintenance cost array of mutual funds, and above all, do not churn your stocks. It doesn't help to be smart, lucky, a stud with the girls, or blessed by God. Moreover, if you think you have one of the \\"gifted analysts\\" for a broker, you are to be counted as among the suckers who are never given an even break.<br /><br />Shefrin has another thesis which he presents with great verve, but which is on very shakey grounds. This is that \\"gifted stock analysts\\" can on average, significantly out-perform the market. He believes this MUST be the case if a significant fraction of investors are behaving irrationality. However, there is another possibility, which is that stock brokers as a group gain from the excessive churning that irrational investors permit or ask them to do, but that it is impossible to \\"beat the market\\" except by pure luck or by personally studying firm fundamentals and future prospects.<br /><br />Shefrin's data in favor of the \\"gifted analyst\\" is episodic and anecdotal, and there is plenty of data on the other side. For instance, in Malkiel's classic \\"Random Walk Down Wall Street\\", he relates the evidence that chimps throwing darts do as well as major brokerage houses. Sheffrin presents contrary evidence for a more recent period in which \\"gifted experts\\" outperform the random darts. New evidence, collected by Money magazine, shows that a group of experts did far worse than the darts in 2003. All of this evidence is spotty and anecdotal. The plural of anecdote is not data.<br /><br />I am not convinced by this book that the efficient markets hypothesis, applied to final returns to investors (after payments to stock brokers and other transactions costs), is not correct. I think the author makes a mistake taking so strong a position when the evidence is so weak on this account. I am certainly not convinced that Malkiel's analysis is in any way overturned by new evidence.<br /><br />However, if Shefrin convinces a few investors to act more sanely, he will have fulfilled an important social function.cent period in which \\"gifted experts\\" outperform the random darts.

The book is beautifully produced, with many diagrams and portraits of the scientists, as well as photographed excerpts from famous papers (although there are no color plates).<br /><br />Perhaps the most attractive aspect of Carlson's approach is the care with which he presents the evidence for specific genetic principles, and the arguments used by opponents of what are now elementary textbook principles. Appreciating basic genetic principles is much enhanced by realizing the intellectual struggle involved in each piece of the puzzle. For instance, I have read a dozen times that quantitative geneticists rejected Mendelism because they believed in evolution by continuous, incremental change, whereas Mendel's laws appear to support discontinuous, saltationist, change. I always thought this to be a quite silly objection, and that R. A. Fisher's demonstration of the compatibility of the two views was stating the obvious. Carlson suggests a far deeper objection. Following Galton, quantitative geneticists believed in regression to the mean and blending inheritance, both seeming incompatible with Mendelism. Overcoming these objections is quite a sophisticated task.<br /><br />In another passage, Carlson presents Sewall Wright's reasons for developing his position on gene interaction and environmental effects on natural selection, based on his study of coat color in guinea pigs. Again, he shows that opposition to Mendelian segregation was not just conservative stubbornness, but rather a reaction to the fact that a considerable fraction of inheritance studies did not conform to Mendelian segregation. We now know why, with our understanding of transpositions, gene jumping, and the like.<br /><br />The glory of this book is simply reading the detailed history of marvelous discoveries in an almost blow-by-blow fashion. But, almost as welcome is Carlson's historical method, which he presents briefly at the end of the book. Science, he says, is the \\"winning of the facts.\\" I interpret this to mean that truth needs no explanation---it is its own justification. \\"I have read accounts\\" Carlson says (p. 208) \\"...that attempted to explain science in sociological (in-groups versus outsiders), political (Marxism versus capitalism), or historical (depression, war, and ideology) contexts, and I found these either false or extraneous.\\" This viewpoint is such a breath of fresh air after plowing through so many insufferable post-modern treatments of science.<br /><br />Carlson does have strong and interesting arguments concerning the time and place of scientific discoveries. He notes that genetics was a European stronghold in the Nineteenth century and became an American-led endeavor in the classical period from 1900 to 1930. He attributes this to the scientific freedom offered by the American graduate school, among other things. Hitler and Stalin account for the continued prominence of the American school after 1930, since they induced extremely talented scientists to emigrate to the United States, where they had the freedom to do their research. It is not unreasonable to think that if freedom triumphs in the world, it will be in no small part because good science requires it.elcome is Carlson's historical method, which he presents briefly at the end of the book.

If this were the only factor affecting people's risk assessment, it would be quite difficult to generate an informed social policy in a democratic society, and research in to actual risk levels associated with different degrees of social damage would be worthless, since people simply listen to the gurus that support their personal positions.<br /><br />The authors present no data. Why is data important? Because if 90% of voters fit their description, we are in a much different situation that if 10% do. My best guess is that people systematically underestimate most social risks (e.g. accidental nuclear war, deadly SARS-type plagues) and overestimate a few (riskiness of air travel, danger of poisons in food). Most people, however, are willing to let the ideologues battle it out, and are strongly affected by the way the journalistic accounts of the battle portrays the cogencies of different positions. If I am right, the extremists on either side of positions, of the sort depicted by the authors, perform a valuable function but do not determine the outcome for the purposes of social policy. For instance, there are vehement supporters of gun control and equally vehement supporters of the rights of gun owners. Most voters, however, lie somewhere in the middle and are swayed both by events and scientific evidence. If that is so, the possibility of effective social policy is possible in a democracy. But, some say, the extremists are willing to put in time and money to sway the public, so ideology wins the day in this manner. I respond that it is wise for voters to take the strength of preferences into account in making social policy decisions. At any rate, no balanced discussion of these issues will be found in this volume.	2005-03-04

Rather, he draws on science and common sense to render ostensibly complex issues simple. The central issue of the book is the mind-body problem. He rejects dualism, materialism, epiphenomenological and functionalist approaches, among others. Rather, he argues that the mind is part of nature, a product of biological evolution, and hence part of the physical world. The mind, he says, is simply the operation of the brain from an organizational point higher than the neuron and synapse, the same as we might say that a computer is the operation of electronic devices, viewed at a level higher than the bit and the byte.<br /><br />How very simple! Why is this pellucid view more acceptable today than a century or a millennium ago? The answer is that modern science has made Searle's answer credible. First, we now can chart the development of mind in animals, and we can be quite certain that many vertebrates are conscious beings. Therefore consciousness and mind are products of biological evolution. Second, modern science is quite at home with the stunning inscrutability of the natural world. Einstein, a Twentieth century scientist with a Nineteenth century aesthetic and morality, never accepted quantum mechanics, considering it just too, too weird. Complexity theory, revealed mathematically and through the power of the computer, allows us to understand the concept of emergence, in which a higher level of complexity supports the emergence of properties that cannot be predicted or analyzed completely from component parts.<br /><br />It used to be thought that science is reductivist, but now we know that sciences is a dynamic tension between reducing wholes to their parts, and recognizing that at critical points, the whole is a complex, nonlinear, dynamical system that transcends it parts.<br /><br />If you understand how profoundly weird the laws of nature are, and if you appreciate how stunningly beautiful and unexpected are the products of evolution, then you will have no trouble accepting Searle's thesis. The human mind is an entity of completely, utterly, overarchingly inscrutable functioning. But, for all that, there is no reason to cast mind out of the realm of the physical, into some other mysterious never-never land. This is Searle's message.<br /><br />All of Searle's positions flow from the above insight. For instance, he resolves the issue of free will vs. determinism by asserting that since mind is part of the physical world, and since physical entities can cause physical events to occur (Searle rejects Humean skepticism concerning causation), then psychological causes are possible, and hence free will is possible, at least at our current level of understanding of mental events.<br /><br />Searle replaces philosophical questions with scientific questions. If mind is part of physical reality, and if free will is possible, then there must be something radically missing from physics and chemistry, which cannot explain mind. But, of course, physics and chemistry cannot explain life, either in the deepest, most mysterious sense of ontological being, or in the most mundane sense of biological theory. It does not help to know the quantum state of a frog. Similarly, the fact that physics cannot explain consciousness in no way means that mind is something other than part of nature.<br /><br />The last sentence of the book says it all. \\"There is just one world; it is the world we all live in, and we need to account for how we exist as part of it.\\"ly weird the laws of nature are, and if you appreciate how stunningly beautiful and unexpected are the products of evolution, then you will have no trouble accepting Searle's thesis.

This fact gives many people the courage to say that everything that is capable of explanation, is capable of scientific explanation, and every mystery is either an ultimately inpenetrable mystery on one that will, at the appropriate future time, be explained scientifically.<br /><br />Human beings are a species, and hence like all other creatures, a product of Darwinian evolution. This fact has emboldened many to claim that all that is human can be explained by the evolutionary principles of reproduction with mutation, selection, and adaptation. Of course, it is far from true that scientists have succeeded in explaining all human characteristics and behaviors. We do not understand why we have self-reflective consciousness or language, whereas other creatures do not. We do not understand why we can produce science, mathematics, music, art, poetry, and a host of other human achievements that appear to lie so far beyond the requirements of evolutionary success, as exhibited by the rest of the natural order.<br /><br />Many scientists claim that, although we do not have explanation of such phenomena at the present time, since we are the products of evolutionary adaptation, all these myriad human capacities are necessarily adaptations. And this is the case, whether we eventually succeed in explaining them or not.<br /><br />O'Hear argues the contrary with respect to three aspects of human achievement: epistemology, morality, and beauty. His epistemological argument is the most cogent, I believe. Why do human being seek truth? The evolutionary epistemologist will say that truth-seeking is adaptive. But, no other species seeks truth. Why is truth-seeking adaptive for us alone? An evolutionary approach to knowledge suggests that an organism will seek truth only insofar as the fitness gains outweigh the search costs. Humans, on the other hand, appear to have an incessant, unquenchable, insistent, drive to understand the world around them. This drive cannot be deduced from evolutionary theory. Indeed, evolutionary theory shows that very often being deluded has a fitness advantage over knowing the truth. For instance, avoided all prey with certain coloring may be fitness enhancing because some such prey is poisonous. But one is deluded concerning the non-poisonous prey with this coloring. The predator species may well remain deluded in this respect during its whole existence, since its inquisitive members have died off it the search for truth. Evolutionists may tell many just-so stories to convince themselves that the drive for truth is an adaptation. But they don't convince beyond their own little circle, I believe.<br /><br />Turning to morality, O'Hear correctly characterizes Twentieth Century evolutionary biology as holding that humans are selfish, and that morality is either a justification of pursuing selfish ends, or is an artificial overlay on basic human nature, required to keep us civil to one another in complex, modern societies. This opinion follows from the general rejection of group selection by biologists over the past fifty years. O'Hear argues that humans have a distinctive, relatively altruistic, morality stemming from the nature of human consciousness, and that this is therefore not given by the conditions of human selection and evolutionary adaptation.<br /><br />His argument is that \\"Self-consciousness looks for recognition and validation by other self-consciousnesses.\\" For this reason, we have empathy for others, and we act in healthy prosocial manners. That this argument is incorrect can be inferred from the existence of sociopathic individuals, who possess all their cognitive faculties, have a sense of self, recognize that others have minds and selves, but care not one whit whether they are recognized positively by others, and care not one whit whether others live or die, so long as they, the sociopaths, get what they want in the world.<br /><br />The fact is that empathy, sympathy, shame, guilt, and other prosocial traits most humans share are in fact the product of our evolutionary history. This means that the Twentieth century biology to the contrary is incorrect. This is the conclusion of much research that has been carried out over the past fifteen years. It is summarized in a forthcoming book from MIT Press, Moral Sentiments and Material Interests, and there are many relevant articles that people can find reference to on my personal web site.<br /><br />O'Hear's approach to beauty is to note that once we have a degree of freedom from immediate want, non-utilitarian motivations can affect our behavior and development. O'Hear's argument is cogent, but I was surprised to find the sensory exploitation theory of Ryan and others is missing from his account. The sensory exploitation theory is a quite compelling explanation of why we find beautiful some of the same things that attract birds, bees, and other creatures, and shows that there is a biological continuity in the appreciation of sensory input across the species spectrum. The Ryan thesis may also explain the absolutely stunning fact that there is close agreement on what is an is not beautiful that overrides cultural differences. I remember personally the first time I saw African wood sculptures and Oceanic statues. I was totally transfixed, despite the fact that I had never seen anything like either (they are very, very different, of course) before.<br /><br />Despite the fact that O'Hear could have made a better argument for beauty had he dealt with the sensory exploitation of neural circuitry, I found myself in basic agreement with his thesis that the sense of beauty goes immeasurably beyond the survival requirements of our species, and obeys a natural dynamic that cannot be captured by survival of the fittest.<br /><br />I am pretty convinced that evolutionary explanations of human behavior are absolutely central to our understanding. I am also convinced that humans have capacities that cannot now, and most likely never will, succumb to the models of evolutionary theorists, although they may be explained in other ways, both secular and transcendant.

I did not have much sympathy with his argument (see my review), but when I saw that there was a new volume coming out, some seven years later, I purchased it to see what progress had been made on forging an alternative to mainstream economics. The answer is simple: none. This book is simply a rewrite of his earlier book, with several journal articles appended as chapters.<br /><br />The fact is that the twin ideas of ontological commitment and critical thinking are simply generalities that have no possiblity of generating a research program. Lawson will appeal to people who (a) don't like math; (b) have a vague idea that there must be something better than contemporary capitalism, but they don't quite know what; (c) believe that superficial description, when suitably enveloped in philosophical jargon, becomes deep (critial realism, ontology, consciousness, human subjectivity, etc.)<br /><br />Lawson's assertion that there is something wrong with contemporary mainstream economics has no intellectual basis at all. He notes that undergrads are not majoring in economics (not true, except perhaps in a couple of countries), that French students critique their curriculum, and mainstream economists sometimes gripe about the discipline. Economics is not a popularity contest for undergraduates. Economics is quite imperfect, and there is lots of room for complaining. But Lawson wouldn't know success in economics if it smacked him in the face, because he never deals in the least with modern economics. Nothing on classical game theory. Nothing on evolutionary game theory. Nothing on experimental economics. Nothing (more) on econometrics. The economics of the period 1950-1975, which he continues to take for all of economics, has been mightily succesful, and more than half of economists are employed (at good salaries) applying it in industry and government. Perhaps their employees are also completely deluded. Perhaps they should hire economists who understand ontology. But I doubt it.<br /><br />Lawson is the height of blandness. He doesn't say economics should be an art rather than a science. He doesn't say that mainstream economists are evil or self-serving. He doesn't claim that mainstream economics is an ideological apology for capitalism, patriarchy, or materialism. He simply says that mainstream economics ignores methodology, and hence can't be sufficiently scientific.<br /><br />The problem is that scientists never care much about methodology. The great economists (like great physicists, geologists, et al.) learn a very simple set of messages concerning how research is done, and then they do it. It doesn't require extended training. Philosophers who think they can preach to scientists how they should ply their trade are profoundly wrong. Philosophy is wonderful, but not when it tries to tell scientists how to do their work.<br /><br />It is really sad, to me, that something this shoddy could get the rave blurbs it does, from people who should know better. I am, frankly mystified. The simplest explanation is that Lawson has a small but loyal following, and he is preaching to the choir. I will get lots of \\"unhelpful\\" votes for this review, but I've never seen an naked emperor without exclaiming his lack of suitable attire.hey should hire economists who understand ontology.

Much of the book is involved in developing economic methodology, and using the product of this development to critique deductivist economics and provide a basis for an alternative.<br /><br />I disagree completely with (b), and only partially with (a). Lawson never argues at all why we should study methodology. He just believes it is obvious. But, when you study economics, you learn of lots of people who have contributed, none of whom was a methodologist, and most of whom never studied or took seriously methodology (except perhaps in their old age, long after their contributions). Natural scientists learn just enough methodology to get started researching, and pick up some more through tacit knowledge (learning from colleagues). But, mostly it's intuitive. Just as you don't need to know linguistics to speak perfect English, you don't have to know methodology to be a great researcher. And obversely.<br /><br />The important point is: the only successful critique of a theory is a theory that predicts and explains better. Methodological critiques carry no weight at all with scientists, natural or behavioral. I believe that is both correct and as it should be, and the book gives me no reason to think otherwise.<br /><br />As to the first point, Lawson seriously understates the value of \\"deductivist\\" models. From the Physiocratic Tableau, to Cournot's model of duopoly and Ricardo' theory of rent, to models of supply and demand, thence to the Edgeworth Box and ultimately to general equilibrium theory and its Fundamental Theorem, deductive arguments have been incredibly important in explaining why market economies work and why incentives are important. We would not have the foggiest idea of how to assess economic arrangments unless we had studied these models.<br /><br />Lawson is correct in saying that most of the deductivist theory found in the journals is just drivel, but that is true in natural science too, and even in mathematics. We only know ex post what is important. For instance, the past few decades have given us principal-agent models, which are incredibly important for understanding market economies, and game theory, which is immensely revealing and used in policy-making, structuring of government and private auctions,  and industrial regulation, to name a few applications.<br /><br />Lawson is also especially critical of econometrics and economic forecasting. He is wrong on both counts. First, he only discusses time series macroeconomic forecasting, when most econometrics is used on cross-sectional data, and it works quite well. Even in time series, while the grand hopes of the 1970 to make accure macro forecasting models never materialized (and are no longer pursued by theorists), econometric forecasting is probably one of the most sought-after skills an economist has, and is used widely in business and government.<br /><br />So, what is left of Lawson's critique? Nothing. I have ordered his new book, to see if it is any better, but I don't have high hopes.<br /><br />This does not mean that mainstream economic theory is in great shape and cannot be critiqued. Far from it. The point is, however, that each generation of young economists sees the errors in the previous, and the enterprising ones transform research by moving to repair the problems. Criticizing mainstream economics is difficult because it is a moving target--always changing to meet new circumstances.<br /><br />Lawson does not look at new developments in economics at all. His book was published in 1997, but it deals with the economics of the 1950-75 period (e.g., the author's extended dialog with Frank Hahn, whose work is of this period). No game theory. Very old-fashioned econometrics. No experimental economics. These are the moving forces of contemporary economics! Lawson devotes much space to how economics cannot be experimental, whereas experimentalist are now in the ascendancy in economics (witness the Nobel prize given to Daniel Kahneman and Vernon Smith two years ago).se work is of this period).

This process has been going on for more than a decade, and results appear frequently in book form, in the economics journals, in psychology journals, and even in such general scientific journals as Nature, Science, New Scientist, and Scientific American. Such major names as Daniel Kanheman, Amos Tversky, Elinor Ostrom, Bruno Frey, Vernon Smith, Kevin McCabe, and Ernst Fehr do not appear in this book. Evolutionary game theory, which has all but displaced classical game theory, is mentioned a couple of times, in passing. Modern developments are completely absent from this book, which is therefore woefully out of date.<br /><br />This is not very surprising. The author critiques theory rather than producing it, while others are producing new theories that at least outdate the critiques, and perhaps also solve some of the problems indicated by the critic.<br /><br />What the author does, he does fairly well, although sometimes exceptionally complex arguments are alluded to rather than developed and assessed, as is the case of the presumptions of classical game theory in justifying the Nash equilibrium concept.<br /><br />All in all, this will assuage the curiosity of newcomers to economics and dabblers, but there is nothing new here.	2004-09-17

Giocoli's is a classic ways: describe the subtle transformation of a single concept across time. This is an important endeavor because the individuals involved in the transformation rarely appreciate that the process is occurring, or if they do, they consider the reconceptualization to be a part of the accumulation of knowledge, rather than a shift in what is being explained.<br /><br />Giocoli's book is a subclass of the \\"transformation of ideas\\" approach which adds a critical dimension, claiming that the earlier concept has a richer value than the later, and the supposed scientific advance was at best, purchased by a certain trivialization of the subject, and at worst, no advance at all.<br /><br />In this case the concept is that of the rational actor. Giocoli sums up his views very early: \\"We started from the classic notion of a rational agent [who is] a relentless maximizer who aimed at pursuing his/her own goals and desires, and ended with the shrinking of rationality to a formal requirement of consistency, where the notion of agency itself was so stripped down of its human peculiarities as to become an all-purpose concept valid for real individuals as well as for groups or machines.\\" (p. 3)<br /><br />How could economists have accepted such a move from substance to formalism? Giocolo argues that the transformation of the rational actor was part of a more general movement in neoclassical economics from a substantive system of forces (SOF) approach to a formalistic system of relations (SOR) approach. In<br />an SOF approach, one attempts to explain real actors as substantive rational actors striving to maximize, whereas in an SOR approach, one attempts to idealize the actor and explain the idealization.<br /><br />Unlike Giocoli, I very much admire the economic theory that he critiques, although I certainly agree with him that one of its effects is that a good deal of economic theory suffers from a ludicrous \\"mathematics envy\\" that would be amusing if it were not such a tragic waste of talent. Indeed, many mathematical economists pride themselves on their ignorance of real economies, and pursue their irrelevant studies with an absurdly inflated self-importance. For instance, von Neumann-Morgenstern-type game theory, with its stable sets, Shapley values and the like, continue to be the object of intensive investigation, despite the fact that the cooperative game theory model has never shown itself to be in the least useful. Simillarly, theorists give each other kudos for proving that a result that holds for a finite number consumers continues to hold with a continuum of consumers. But, in fact, there are only a finite number of consumers, so there is no reason to generalize to the continuous case! Of course, if you cannot prove something<br />in the finite case but you can in the continuous case, that is a different story. The continuous case may be a simplifying assumption, but it often gives rise to powerfully predictive models.<br /><br />Each of the theories Giocoli criticizes has been the basis for a staggering variety of empirical findings that are now being used to revise the formalist theory in such a way as to become, once again, substantive. Consider, for instance, decision theory. This became formalist in the hands of Savage, Samuelson, and others, who showed that one could retrieve the maximization<br />subject to constraints model from a few simple axiomatic consistency assumptions. The resulting model, however, became the key element in the experimental methodology of choice theory in psychology. In the expert hands of Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman and others, this \\"formalist\\" decision theory, with its stripped-down concept of rationality, yielded a surfeit of<br />psychological generalizations that were quite unavailable prior to the \\"formalist revolution\\" in decision theory.<br /><br />Giocoli's treatment of game theory suffers from an excessive attempt to fit things nicely into his overall theory. He praises the cooperative game theory of von Neumann and Morgenstern as being part of the system of forces (SOF) approach which is being abandoned by economists, even though nothing has ever come of the theory in terms of successful models of real social processes, and the main result of their work was the axiomatization of choice under uncertainty (expected utility), which was the underpinning of the formalization of the rationality concept. Giocoli tries to explain why the Nash equilibrium concept was ignored during the 1950's and 1960's, and did not come into its own until the 1980's and later, by saying that Nash's concept of equilibrium is \\"formalist\\" and could not be embraced until neoclassical economics itself had become \\"formalist.\\" I do not accept this explanation at<br />all.<br /><br />The period from 1950 to 1970 was one in which economic theory was preoccupied with relatively narrow issues concerning economic stabilization (fiscal and monetary policy), the market/state mix (public economics), and development economics, itself stressing physical and human capital formation and<br />technical change. Game theory has relatively little to say about these subjects. By the mid-1970's, by contrast, economists were fully involved in dealing with such social areas as crime, poverty, substance abuse, gender roles, corruption, the family, and other areas in which game theory excels. The work of Nobel prize winner Gary Becker exemplifies these new concerns,<br />but many economists have been involved. Noncooperative game theory, and the Nash equilibrium as its organizing concept, have been central to understanding these areas, and game theory has accordingly been admitted to the center of contemporary neoclassical economics.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Giocoli is correct in saying that the Nash equilibrium concept is \\"formalist.\\" I say this because the Nash criterion calls something an equilibrium when no single agent can gain by moving from it, whereas in the real world, multiple agents can move at the same time, and even in concert. Of course, such coordinated movement is at the heart of equilibrium notions in cooperative game theory, which may well be why von Neumann rejected Nash's work. It is telling that when the animal behaviorist John Maynard Smith appropriated game theory in the period 1972-1982, he saw fit to correct this weakness in the Nash criterion, developing the notion of an \\"evolutionarily<br />stable strategy,\\" which is anything but formalist. The value of evolutionary game theory in biology has been of the highest order, effectively revolutionizing animal behavior theory in the three decades since Maynard Smith and Price wrote their first article on the subject.<br /><br />Giocoli reveals the weakness of his approach in his treatment of evolutionary game theory. I will not go through the details of his argument, which is quite shabby. The weakness of his approach is simple: when he sees economic theory developing in an incorrect manner, he writes a critique. This is fine for dealing with the past, but when operating in the present, one must look around and see if there are researchers aware of and attempting to develop a better theory. For instance, he does not mention my review of attempts to correct economic formalism in my book Game Theory Evolving (Princeton University Press, 2000), even though this predates his book by three years. Much more surprising is the lack of mention of the contributions of Kahneman and his coworkers. One might infer that Giocoli is as unconcerned with empirical reality as those that he criticizes.<br /><br />His failure to look for contemporary developments led Giocoli to<br />underappreciate the salutary effect of \\"formalist\\" decision theory and game theory on empirical work and hence on the repair of formalism. All of the competitors of the neoclassical tradition he criticizes have fallen by the wayside, and the neoclassical tradition has been only fortified and strengthened by its critics. Giocoli's critique clearly applies to much overbearing super-formalism in contemporary neoclassical theory, and this book's message will appeal to those opposed to analytical model-building altogether. But, until a better alternative comes along, I will continue to defend evolutionary game theory and other attempts to contribute to the analytical modeling of human behavior.<br />.<br />.ame time, and even in concert.

As far as I can tell, there is no coherent liberal position on foreign policy (liberals offer only scattershot critiques of conservative positions, mostly silly and prima facie incorrect or implausible). So, I think of this book as a general contribution to an important debate concerning American foreign policy.<br /><br />I should begin by saying that I don't like conservatives, I don't like liberals, and I think the middle of the road is for white lines and road kill only. The idea that there is some overarching political philosophy that makes one a leftist or a rightist is just a sad joke. One size fits all, I believe, is suitable only for morons.<br /><br />The authors believe that America's success in foreign policy has been as much due to careful, creative, restrained diplomacy, as it has to the display of military power. In one of the most insightful sections of the book, they snatch Ronald Reagan from the neo-conservative camp by showing (a) how restrained his foreign policy was, almost never resorting to using American troops; and (b) how disappointed the neo-conservatives were at the time with Reagan's foreign policy decisions and their being frozen out of the top jobs in the Reagan administration.<br /><br />To my mind, President Reagan was one of the greatest foreign policy president ever, and his approach to foreign policy was diametrically opposed to that of the neoconservatives. I should note that I though Reagan's dealings in Latin America were criminal, and if I had my way, I would have had him criminally prosecuted for his support for death squads, fascist generals, and the like. I also thought Star Wars was a stupid waste of money and nuclear brinkmanship was extremely dangerous. He would have done better to press the Soviet Union with conventional forces alone. But, that is a different story.<br /><br />Everything else the authors say is subordinate to the above message, but several of their points are still quite telling. For one, they claim the neo-conservative black vs. white treatment of \\"good and evil\\" in foreign affairs leads them to overstate the clash between Islamic and Judeo-Christian cultures, and by putting all of their eggs in the Middle East disputes, they ignore the large threat of rogue states, China a a looming super-power, and nuclear containment. Moreover, by seeing terrorism as an aspect of the Islam vs. West struggle, they treat the defeat of Saddam Hussein as a victory against Islamic terrorism, when in fact it is a strong aid to Islamic terrorism because of the disrepute into which the United States is thrown by our preemptive action in Iraq. This all sounds right to me.<br /><br />I usually do not expect a book to change my mind, but this book has. I'm not sure yet where it is taking me, but the arguments presented in this book are very persuasive. I agree with others who have reviewed this book---you should read it!<br /><br />The only reason I did not give this book five stars is that it is a bit bloated. Chapters 5 to 9 could have been eliminated or at least drastically shortened. This would have improved the readability of the book., but several of their points are still quite telling.

This is very lively, informal, and humorous commentary on our society based on rigorous psychological research undertaken by Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky,Richard Thaler, and their coworkers over the past few decades. I know other readers found this book tedious, but I'm not sure why. Perhaps because it has some math in it? At any rate, I treated the book like pleasant light reading.<br /><br /> Dawes claims to hold a very tight definition of rationality, but in fact, he uses the term to describe a host of different behaviors, including holding unfounded beliefs, having weird personal moral values, or just ignoring the evidence. I use a<br /><br /> very narrow definition of rationality in my work (preference consistency is the substance of it), and I generally disapprove of throwing the term &quot;rationality&quot; around ad libidem---academics invoke rationality to justify their prejudices in the same manner clergy invoke God to justify theirs. But Dawes is sloppy in such a disarming way in his usage that it is hard to fault him.<br /><br /> Dawes actually relies on only a couple of well document psychological phenomena (he could have dealt with several more). One is a framing effect, in which if a choice is framed in terms of losses, people choose one way, and if in terms of gains, a very different way. It is actually closely related to loss aversion, which Dawes does not discuss.<br /><br /> A second phenomenon is ignoring base rates. For instance, suppose you learn that a test for HIV is 90% accurate, and you ask people what is the probability they have HIV is they test positive. Most say 90%. However, suppose only one person out of<br /><br /> 100 is HIV positive. Take a group of 1000 people. Ten will be HIV positive (on average...) and nine will test positive. But 990 will be HIV negative and 99 of these will test positive. Thus, if you test positive, your chances of being HIV positive are only 9/(99+9)=8.33%.<br /><br /> This is an important phenomenon, but &quot;irrational&quot; is a bit strong here, as elsewhere in the book. We expect experts to know how to do conditional probabilities, but it is no more &quot;irrational&quot; to get this wrong than to fail to solve third order partial differential equations.<br /><br /> I very much liked Dawes' treatment of Sexual Abuse Hysteria. In this chapter, he really does show the aberrant reasoning of the judges and attornies associated with the incredible miscarriages of justice associated with this dark period in American history.ll test positive.

We humans are the genetic product of hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, during most of which we lived as menial hunter-gatherers with a 35 year life expectancy. Given this genetic heritage, Stanovich asks, is there any way we can free ourselves from being the captives of our genetic pre-history?<br /><br /> The setting for this analysis is Richard Dawkins' argument in The Selfish Gene that we humans are &quot;giant lumbering robots&quot; who serve only as transient containers for our genes, who are the truly eternal replicators.<br /><br /> Stanovich makes the following arguments. First, there are two decision processes in the human brain. The first is the Autonomous Set of Systems (TASS) which we share with nonhuman animals, is a complete product of our evolutionary history, and only very imperfectly serves our contemporary interests. For instance, the TASS may tell us to overeat, have unsafe sex, or enjoy other forms of immediate gratification. However, there is a second decision center, which Stanovich calls 'analytical' that can override the TASS. This sounds like Freud's Id and Ego, which is one of Freud's unsullied contributions to human understanding. There is much evidence in favor of the TASS/analytical distinction.<br /><br /> Stanovich is to be praised for NEVER descending into the philosopher's morass, in which the question would be posed as one of 'free will.' I do not know if there is free will, but I do know the scientific evidence on which Stanovich's case is built.<br /><br /> The author's second thesis is that the same sociobiology that gave us selfish genes also seriously downgrades the importance of CULTURE in understanding human evolution and dynamics. Boy, is this ever true! His case is built up meticulously from a good knowledge of the contemporary research literature in the area, and is quite persuasive.<br /><br /> Stanovich's point is that the analytic brain can alter culture so as to overcome the biases of the TASS system, allowing humans to realize truly human and emancipatory goals. For instance, even though we all make elementary error in statistical decision-making (the brilliant work of Kahneman, Tversky, et al. shows this), experts can avoid the errors and can instruct others to do so as well.<br /><br /> But now comes Stanovich's third point: we cannot necessarily control culture so that it becomes an instrument of emancipation. According to memetic theory, we are as controlled by our memes (little nodules of culture) as we are by are genes. Stanovich does not manage to solve this problem, and suggests that we all be critically aware of the possibility that we adopt cultural practices that serve only to harm and constrain us. His list of rules for evaluation memes is quite useful and plausible.<br /><br /> I think the answer to Stanovich's problem is that the whole notion of memetics is rubbish. His defense of the notion in the book is uncharacteristically weak, to the point of being pathetic. For instance, he asserts that memetics itself is a meme complex, so if many people accept memetics and memetics is wrong, the memetics must be right! In fact, memetics posits behavior with no evolutionary justification. This is: we accept memes because they force themselves upon us. But, a creature who behaved in this way would be evolutionarily eclipsed by another who did not succumb.<br /><br /> The correct treatment of culture is that it is an epigenetic form of information transfer, and humans evolved to use it to enhance their fitness. The fact that sometimes we adopt harmful memes no more contradicts this than the fact that there are deleterious genetic mutation refutes Darwinism. This analysis is well developed in the research area of gene-culture coevolution, which I urge Stanovich to become (more) familiar with. It will open up vistas for him in pursuing his emancipatory project.pen up vistas for him in pursuing his emancipatory project.	2004-07-22

Both genes and culture affect the phenotype, and therefore individual behavior. It follows that both genes are culture are subject to Darwinian selection. In addition, genes are part of the environment in which culture evolves, and culture is part of the environment in which genes evolve. Of course, the physical representation of genes and culture are very different. Genetic information is coded in DNA, while cultural information is coded in the synaptical structure of the brain. Moreover, Fisher's fundamental theorem, which says fitness tends to increase, is true for a single genetic locus, but not for a single culture locus, since agents can sustain an increase in a fitness-decreasing meme. Durham uses the term 'meme' for a unit of cultural inheritance. I think his defense of this is one of the strongest points in this great book. He shows that culture cannot be identified with phenotype or behavior. It follows that we must drop the term 'geno-phenotype'. In its place we can use the term 'geno-memotype.' Variants at a cultural locus are called allomemes by Durham. Good choice.<br />We have learned much about brain functioning, the role of emotions, autism and sociopathy, and human altruism since this book was published (1991), and Durham uses no math, which I always thought a necessary part of gene-culture coevolutionary theory. Neither of these is a drawback, and indeed the fact that he produces a brilliant model of coevolution without the usual mathematical tools is a true tour de force!<br />Durham provides extended analyses of Tibetian marriage patterns, lactose tolerance, sickle-cell anemia, and disease transmitted by cannibalism. These are standards of the trade now, but Durham's analysis are absolute gems, even if you know the literature on the topic.	2004-06-24

It is, in this respect, perhaps the intellectual equivalent of Ravel's Bolero, or the yogi's infinitely repeated &quot;Om&quot;. The point is that reductivism is the only tool we have for analyzing the world, it is an amazingly powerful tool, and yet at every level of complexity, emergent phenomena arise that could not have been predicted by the levels that preceded them, and can barely, if at all, be modeled an understood using reductivist analytical and experimental techiques.<br />This is a message that will be rejected by one particular group: the self-styled &quot;scientific atheists&quot; who claim that scientific methodology ineluctably implies that God does not exist, or at least that there is no more reason to believe in God than it is to believe in the Tooth Fairy. Morowitz, by contrast, follows Spinoza in identifying the world of science as dealing with the product of the &quot;immanent God&quot; whose transcendance we attempt to capture spiritually.<br />Scientific atheism's error is its inability to appreciate the notion of emergence. Just as consciousness emerges from a material and chemical substrate the scinetific understanding of which tell us virtually nothing about the nature of its emergent properties, so the physical universe may give rise to an emergent spirituality that simply escapes the scientific imagination. Morovitz' interesting book makes this point extremely clearly.<br />I believe Amazon is due major kudos for providing a forum in which readers can compare and contrast their ideas. I really enjoyed the previous nine reviews of this provocative book.	2004-04-09

But that was many years ago, and I needed a dispassionate overview of the field and a guide to the various philosophical problems confronting scientific explanation. This was the perfect book.<br />Godfrey-Smith saves his own position for the last few chapters of the book, and tries to present a variety of views in the body of the book with great tolerance for imperfections, rough edges, and infelicities. Yet, he has no qualms about proclaiming that a certain view is no longer treated seriously in the field (e.g., logical positivism, covering law theory, analytic/synthetic division).<br />The book covers the whole of the Twentieth Century, from logical positivism, through Quine, Goodman, and Popper, to Kuhn, Lakatos, Feyerabend, Science Studies, feminism, and post-modernism. He is more balanced than I, I must say, since I really hate post-modernism and all of its fellow-travellers, whereas the author tries to find some pearls of wisdom scattered across the dross.<br />Godfrey-Smith comes out for versions of empiricism, naturalism, and scientific realism. I like his mix, but I am a scientist, not a philosopher, so my opinions carry no weight.<br />I would have liked the book to deal with creationism and intelligent design, which are burning issues in the US, though not (yet) in Europe. I would also have like the book to deal with forms of knowledge other scientific (e.g., aesthetic, street smarts, spiritual). Finally, the book doesn't deal with ethics at all. One could defend this by saying that this has nothing to do with science, but I think that is a conclusion and not a premise, and one which is in fact incorrect.	2004-03-21

Most welcome is Dugatkin's talent for popular exposition of animal behavior research.<br />This book is a very general exposition of animal behavior theory for the general public, with a special emphasis on epigenetic transmission of information, which Dugatkin equates with cultural transmission. He does quite a good job, and I would recommend this book to curious newcomers to the field. Dugatkin is especially good at weaving general themes (e.g., the various explanations of mate choice) with the specifics of particular<br />experiments.<br />My concern here will be as an animal behaviorist whose specialty is human beings. Humans come into the picture in the first sentence of Dugatkin's book: &quot;We desperately want to think of ourselves as somehow distinct from other life forms on our planet...Currently there is the sense that we are unique because<br />&quot;culture&quot; is found only in humans...As we shall see, culture is not humanity's gift to the universe.&quot; (p. ix). There is no doubt but that Dugatkin is correct, and indeed, it is impossible to understand human culture as divorced from the broad sweep of cultural phenomena across species. The attempt to do so is a major flaw in sociological and anthropological approaches to human culture--but that is another story to tell.<br />While Dugatkin's assertion is correct, and his efforts to motivate his position are quite successful, it is curious that he does not place his argument in intellectual context. John Tyler Bonner's pathbreaking The Evolution of Culture in Animals (Princeton University Press 1984) is not mentioned, nor is Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb's ambitious Epigenetic Inheritance and Evolution (Oxford University Press 1995) are not mentioned.<br />Nor is the Baldwin effect, which is a major causal link from culture to genes (Baldwin, &quot;A New Factor in Evolution&quot;, American Naturalist 30 1896).<br />Dugatkin is quite orthodox in taking the gene-culture coevolution definition of culture as &quot;information&quot;, a definition anchored in the two great contributions of Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, Cultural Transmission and Evolution (Princeton University Press, 1981), and Boyd and Richerson, Culture and the Evolutionary Process (University of Chicago Press, 1985). In brief, this view holds that culture is information concerning the organism's physical and biological environment. While the basic biological information transmission mechanism is genetic inheritance, epigenetic transmission may also be fitness enhancing, and when it is, we can expect cultural transmission in animals. I do not dispute the fact that culture includes epigenetic information transmission. For instance, as Dugatkin stresses the tendency for previously mated male guppies to be desirable to unmated females may be due to the fact that older female guppies &quot;teach&quot; younger females who the desirable males are (although there are other plausible explanations of this phenomenon). I do believe, however, that (a) imitation in animals is categorically distinct from the &quot;teaching&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; that typically occurs in human cultural transmission; and (b) the culture-as-information definition of culture is considerably too narrow to embrace all of human culture, and misses what is particularly unique about human culture.<br />On the first point, most animal behaviorists have come to accept the idea that, pace bird imitations of vocalizations, animals do not imitate complex learned behavior directly. Rather, the contiguity of an individual to a conspecific carrying out a particular learned behavior increases the probability that the individual will stumble upon the same behavior. For instance, if a chimp discovers how to use a stone to smash open a food item,<br />her child will be frequently in situations where stones and thefood item are contiguous, and hence is more likely to discover the complex behavior. But the behavior is neither &quot;learned&quot; from the parent, or &quot;taught&quot; by the parent to the child. For more on this topic, the reader might refer to Tomasello and Call, Primate Cognition (Oxford University Press 1997), Daniel Povinelli, Folk Physics for Apes: The Chimpanzee's Theory of How the World Works (Oxford 2000), and Marc Hauser, Wild Minds: What Animals Really Think (Henry Holt, 2000).<br />The most distinctive characteristic of human culture, however, is the existence of ethical norms and values. A value such as &quot;dress modestly,&quot; &quot;work hard and do not succumb to temptations that yield only short-run pleasures,&quot; and &quot;forgive those who transgress upon you,&quot; are deeply cultural forms, but they do not involve objective information about the world. Unlike a technique, such as how to fashion a tool, where to look for prey, or what types of things are edible, an ethical value has no scientific truth value. Of course, one might assert that if one follows a certain norm, certain material results will obtain (e.g., long life, good after-life, high fitness, happiness), but humans follow norms for their own sake, and<br />even when these good results are not expected. In sociology this is called the internalization of norms (see, for instance, Grusec and Kuczynski, Parenting and Children's Internalization of Values: A Handbook of Contemporary Theory, John Wily &amp; Sons 1997). The human capacity to internalize norms is thus akin to the programmability of human goals, since the key factor in an internalized value is that people \emph{conform to the prescribed behavior for its own sake, and as a goal of action, rather than a means towards the realization of other goals. As I argue in &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to Altruism: Genes, Culture, and the Internalization of Norms&quot;, Journal of Theoretical Biology 220,4 (2003):407-418, the programmability of the preference function is key to human prosocial behavior, quite on par with the accumulation and transmission of the types of cultural techniques associated with improving the ability to exploit the physical and natural environment.<br />I would have preferred that Dugatkin include in his analysis both the factors leading to a commonality of culture across species, and the factors involved in the special cultural position of humans, but just dealing with the first of these makes for a quite informative and interesting contribution.item are contiguous, and hence is more likely to discover the complex behavior.

The novelty of this book is that it counterposes sociobiology to developmental biology rather than its traditional foe, anti-biological approaches to human sociality. This counterposition is particularly curious, since many developmental biologists consider this the age of \\"evo-devo\\", where the synergistic interaction of evolutionary and developmental modeling are increasingly recognized. Despite Francis' concerted and repeated attempt to portray sociobiology and behavioral developmental biology as alternative approaches to understanding social behavior, I remain completely unconvinced.<br />Francis writing style and mode of reasoning are profoundly distasteful to me, though others might enjoy it. Francis relishes in contrasting ideas that are in principle mutually consistent and even reinforcing. He draws the intellectual landscape in stark black and white/good and evil, where I generally see the textured grays of creatively contrasting and equally plausible ideas just waiting for some insightful researcher to draw them together into a satisfying explanatory framework. For instance, he depicts the search for the evolutionary origins of social behavior as the \\"paranoic\\" search for \\"teleological explanations.\\" Metaphors relating to psychological illness when speaking of \\"adaptationist theory\\" recur incessantly throughout this distinctly intemperate book. Evolutionary psychology, for instance, is flippantly referred to as \\"evo-psycho.\\"<br />Even substantively, Francis' method of dealing approaches alternative to his own is, to my mind, shallow and distasteful. I was taught that when disagreeing with a theory, one must first present the theory in as strong and coherent manner as possible, and critique only the most shining and forceful of the theory's ostensible successes. Francis, by contrast, is a bottom-feeder who will launch his missiles against any random representative of the opposing school. Indeed, despite that fact that more than one-third of this book is devoted to notes, index, and bibliography, Francis rarely deigns to cite directly his opponent, rather being content to provide an broad description of the field in question. Typical is the argument relating to the title of book. I don't know of a serious sociobiological argument as to why men don't ask for directions. I don't even know if it's a true fact in search of an explanation. Francis, nevertheless, treats the issue as though it had some intrinsic scientific value.<br />Francis is smart enough, however, to recognize that he is no match for the greats of the field, so when George Williams, Ronald Fisher, John Maynard Smith, Edward Wilson, or Niko Tinbergen is mentioned, Francis abandons the derogatory bravado and accurately describes the eminently reasonable positions they have taken on the issue of the relationship between evolution and development, adaptation and developmental constraints, and the other topics treated in this book.<br />The stance taken by Francis is a shame, because there are<br />super-adaptationists that tend to consider just-so story as  adequate explanations, and are loathe to deploy any non-adapationist argument.<br />Francis' chapter on the mimicking capacity, perhaps the best in the book, is a case in point. Francis defends the sensory exploitation hypothesis ably against the classical runaway selection and costly signaling approaches to modeling mate choice, and effectively defends the theory that the mockingbird's mimicking capacity is simply a by-product of their song-learning versatility. This versatility may itself have adaptive value, but the fact that many bird species that occupy ecological niches similarto that of the mockingbird lack its versatility calls this into question. Indeed, Francis presents a welcome argument to the effect that exotic animal characteristics are unlikely to be adaptation, or they would be more widely share among species share the exotic species' life style and ecological niche. The female hyena's hypertrophied clitoris, the elephant's trunk, hermaphroditism fish, the giraffe's neck, and the human brain may all be examples of characteristics that occurred despite, rather than because of, adaptationist dynamics.<br />Francis is insistent that sociobiology can only countenance causal forces from physiology and genetic constitution to social constitution, and not vice versa. He contrasts this view, which he calls \\"misguided materialism\\" with the developmental view that social organization can affect brain physiology in the short run and genetic structure in the long run. Presumably he never heard of the Baldwin Effect (the term does not appear in his index), despite its centarian age, or the gene-culture coevolutionary models of Cavalli-sforza and Feldman, Boyd and Richerson, and a host of related analyses that have populated the biology, anthropology, and even economics journals for the past quarter century.<br />Perhaps the most egregious chapter in the book is \\"Sex without SEX,\\" in which he critiques the adaptationist theory of sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction is not an adaptation in vertebrates. Rather, he argues, there is a developmental constraint against hermaphrodism, and adaptationists are too blind to see this shining truth. Francis' argument is shabby and incorrect. First, sexual reproduction is extremely costly and could not persist if it did not provide offsetting advantages. Second, as he notes, there are many hermaphrodite fish species, and lizard species as well, but they appear to be evolutionary dead ends. This could be because there are development constraints in vertebrates (there certainly are, in the form of gene imprinting, in mammals), but this remains to be determined. Third, there is no general non-adaptationist theory of sexual reproduction, to my knowledge. He certainly presents none.<br />Historically, developmentalists have been indifferent or hostile to evolutionary modeling because the do not see how such dynamic historical modelshelp them develop the structural and developmental mechanisms characteristic of living organisms. This stance is no longer fruitful. We now understand that evolutionary models do not prove anything. Rather, they suggest hypotheses to be explored and substantiated. Adaptationist arguments are essential because they suggest the function of homologous and analogous physiological structures. Charting the development of behaviorally-relevant characteristics, such as brain size and social organization, the structure of brains and vocal apparati, using the paleographic evidence, sheds critical light on the path to successfully modeling biological development from the level of cell to that of the complex animal or human society.

It is also a rather subtle book. Even though I used in in a college course I taught in 1989, I do not believe I really understood it until I reread it very recently.<br />Frank asks: why to people help others, and retaliate against others who harm them, even when they can expect no future personal, material gain from so doing? His answer is that there are emotional rewards to helping those who deserve our aid and hurting others who deserve our ire. Our behavior towards others is regulated by the passions: empathy, spite, shame, remorse, guilt, compassion, and the other social emotions.<br />He then asks: why are those who behave in this emotional way not displaced (e.g., by having more offspring, or by acquiring more earthly possessions) by others who are purely selfish, and who help and hurt only when a dispassionate calculation indicates that it is in their material interest to do so? He answers this by noting that our emotions \\"precommit\\" us to keeping our promises and carrying out our threats, so that we gain in the long run by not being able (or willing) to make the dispassionate calculation. We gain because others will trust our promises and respect our threats. Frank calls the the \\"commitment model.\\"<br />This idea that it is \\"rational\\" to be \\"emotional\\" is, of course, a commonplace today, and has been popularized by neuroscientist Alberto Damasio's fine book, Descartes' Error, and more recently, philosopher Martha Nussbaum's UPheavals of Thought. Experiments using behavioral game theory more than amply confirm the centrality of emotions in decision-making even in the company of strangers (see papers on prosocial emotions on my web site: [...]<br />A thornier question is: why can a purely selfish type (otherwise known as a sociopath) not simply mimic the behavior of a committed altruist when it suits his purposes, and not otherwise? If this were possible, and there were no other counteracting tendencies, sociopaths would surely drive out committed altruists. Here Frank is less convincing. He says simply that it is very hard to fake the emotions, just as it is difficult for a small bullfrog to fake his size by mimicking the deep-throated croaks of his larger bretheren. This is true, but some people do this very successfully. Why do they not prosper? Moreover, there is no obvious developmental constraint in humans opposing the evolution of excellent emotional cheats.<br />Perhaps the payoffs to faking commitment are not that high.

If this were possible, and there were no other counteracting tendencies, sociopaths would surely drive out committed altruists. Here Frank is less convincing. He says simply that it is very hard to fake the emotions, just as it is difficult for a small bullfrog to fake his size by mimicking the deep-throated croaks of his larger bretheren. This is true, but some people do this very successfully. Why do they not prosper? Moreover, there is no obvious developmental constraint in humans opposing the evolution of excellent emotional cheats.<br />Perhaps the payoffs to faking commitment are not that high.

The editors and contributors are prominent and distinguished contributors to experimental and interdisciplinary approaches to modeling cooperation.<br />The editors quickly identify the central problem of cooperation: while all gain from cooperating, each individual has an incentive to free-ride on the good will of the others. No cooperation takes place unless the free rider problem is successfully addressed. Ch. 2 presents compelling evidence that face-to-face communication alone is capable of sustaining cooperation in small groups, especially when the task is repeated several times. Moreover, if experimental subjects are allowed to fine shirkers, at a cost to themselves, they do so, despite that fact that purely self-interested subjects would never engage in such activity.<br />There is a fine computer simulation (Ch. 7) that beautifully illustrates the capacity of agent-based modeling to generate interesting hypotheses concerning human behavior--in this case, the synergistic relationship between cooperation and conflict. The experimental chapters of of uniformly high quality, and quite illuminating, including a chapter on the development of trust and reciprocity in children.<br />The theory side of the book is less successful. Several authors say that the experimental results \\"contradict game theory.\\" This is simply incorrect. Like mathematics, game theory can be more or less useful in modeling a phenomenon, but it cannot be \\"wrong.\\" Indeed, all of the experimental results are based squarely on game theory as a tool of experimental design.<br />More important, despite ample evidence that trust and reciprocity cannot be explained assuming selfish individuals, the theorists in the book attempt repeatedly to assert just that. According to the authors, altruistic behavior is caused by mistakes in reasoning! The major theoretical chapter in the book (Ch. 4), for instance, is an exposition of Robert Trivers' concept of \\"reciprocal altruism,\\" which is just long-term self-interest. The experimental results on reciprocity are incompatible with this concept, unless one assumes that subjects simply are ignorant and mistake-prone in their behavior. Numerous experiments show that this is decidedly not the case. In Chapter 6, we are told that subjects are only altruistic because they are afraid that the conditions of anonymity in the experiment are highly imperfect--despite the fact that the evidence for this is extremely weak (one study done in 1994, which has not been replicated, using a dictator game, which is not a social interaction or a social dilemma), and the evidence against which is virtually overwhelming. Later in the chapter we are told (p. 162) that people cooperate in one-shot games because they confuse them with repeated games, with which they are more familiar. This argument is specious, however, because many experiments reveal that people are quite capable of distinguishing between one-shots and repeated games, and cooperate much more in the latter than in the former.<br />So this book will not win any awards for social theory, but it is deep and rich with highly insightful descriptions and analysis of human behavior under conditions where trust and reciprocity increase well being. The Russell Sage foundation, which underwrote the research and preparation of the volume, is to be commended for a job well done.he book (Ch. 4), for instance, is an exposition of Robert Trivers' concept of \\"reciprocal altruism,\\" which is just long-term self-interest.

This is a very admirable goal, and more physicists should become engaged in this critically important task. The problem is that Capra's analysis and interpretations make very little contact with the physical reality he is trying to describe. Rather, he couches pedestrian descriptions of the natural world in complex new age terminology that might lull the unknowledgeable reader that something is being said, when in fact, nothing is being said.<br /><br />For instance, we are informed that life is characterized by cellular constitution, and cells are autopoietic, dissipative structures. When you find out what these arcane terms mean, you are no closer to understanding life, or even cells. Capra doesn't bother talking about what cella are really like, or why life consists of cells. He simply describes them in complicated terms, drawing on the neuroscientists turned philosophers Maturana and Varela, whose brilliance in their fields of expertise is not reflected in their treatment of human consciousness. While their New Age musing may impress non-scientists with their verbal facility, they cut no ice with those who really study life. Cabra flirts with Prigogine's quirky (and completely unuseful for practicing scientists) interpretation of thermodynamics, and since Prigogine is a Nobelist, we are supposed to be duly impressed. I am not. Prigogine did excellent work in the early 1950's, but then seemed to don some sort of intellectual toga and gave up interacting with the real world.<br /><br />I am not prone to an excess of emotion in evaluating scientific projects, which probably saves Capra from a good deal of invective in this review. But, I purchased the book, and I am allowed my say. This book is a hoax, as are all new age interpretations of physical and biology that I have come across.

Billie falls in love with Joyce with depth and commitment, following the death of his first wife Alice. His weakness is a voracious sexual appetite and abolutely no idea that satisfying this appetite with a variety of women is any sort of transgression at all. Joyce likes the finer things in life, has superficial tastes and goals, but cannot stand Billie's roaming ways. Billie, on the other hand, is a scrupulously honest businesman who refuses to compromise his principle to make an \\"easy million or two\\" as Joyce's son Roy puts it. Joyce? She could care less.<br />This lovely and touching book is also a bit of a Requiem for Kotker, who was suffering from the illness that eventually killed him at the time.

The idea that there is an intimate link between individual development and species evolution was publicized more than a century ago by Haeckel, who coined the famous phrase &quot;Ontogeny [individual development] recapitulates phylogeny [species development].&quot; However attractive Haeckel's idea, it prove to be far too simple (see the excellent book &quot;Ontogeny and Phylogeny&quot; by S. J. Gould). For most of the 20th Century, developmental psychologists dealing with humans virtually ignored the evolutionary literature. This book is a largely successful attempt to rectify this curious situation.<br />Developmental psychology explains how nature (genes) and nurture (environment) interact in determining individual intelligence, personality, and social behavior. The authors take a thoroughly &quot;developmental systems perspective,&quot; in which there is a &quot;bidirectional interaction at all levels of organization&quot; (p. 68) between genes and environment.  Since the interaction between genes and culture is in fact highly nonlinear, this perspective is correct, as long as it is not take to the point where we deny the usefulness of heredity estimates (which the authors do not do, though there is virtually no behavioral genetics in the book).<br />The authors expound basic evolutionary psychology, they compare human and animal behavior, and generally suffuse their exposition with an evolutionary dimension. But what exactly is the connection between ontogeny and phylogeny? We are told that much of human behavior is adaptive (e.g. morning sickness in pregnancy), but it is unclear how this affects developmental theory, for which the important question is &quot;is morning sickness good or bad for mother and/or child?&quot; In several cases, they show how developmental psychology can improve evolutionary thinking (e.g., understanding the pace of  individual cognitive development, or the relative importance of domain specific vs. domain general cognitive capacities). But the other direction is only weakly represented in the book.<br />The most important principle of evolutionary theory that applies to developmental psychology, according to the authors, is that infants are not tabula rasa, but rather are predisposed to learn and develop in certain directions (e. g., the acquisition of language, recognition of faces, willingness to share, potential for anger and aggression). They apply this nicely to cognitive development, but fall flat when discussion social development and interaction.<br />This is because the evolutionary psychology position on social development is in serious need of updating. The book presents the standard ev psych view that cooperation, altruism, and aggression can be understood in terms of self-interest, inclusive fitness (Hamilton), and reciprocal altruism (Trivers, but attributed to Hamilton and Axelrod in the book). The development here is very slim, but the position itself is simply wrong.<br />As has been repeatedly shown (see, e.g., the new Russell Sage book on &quot;Commitment,&quot; edited by Randy Nesse, or Sam Bowles and my News and Views article and the Fehr-G&auml;chter paper in Nature, vol. 415, January 10,2002), human behavior is much more broadly and deeply social than traditional ev psych understands. Human development includes not only cognition, cheater detection, and the like, but also guilt, shame, empathy, sympathy, a taste for vengeance and retaliation, the capacity to be socialized into prosocial values, and even more. These are basic developmental themes that are missing from this book, though they are known to social psychologists and are an active subject of research.<br />Of course, I should not fault the authors for not being on the vanguard of evolutionary developmental psychology, since it's hard to get teacher to use a book that has material that they didn't learn in graduate school. But the challenge for the (near) future is to correct this imbalance in evolutionary psychology.ental psychology, since it's hard to get teacher to use a book that has material that they didn't learn in graduate school.

Gould: Survival of the Fittest (Revolutions in Science)	Books	4	85	92	N	N	Solid and Lively	Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould are prominent evolutionary biologists. Both are great writers and both are extremely contentious. Moreover, they disagree in public forums with a startling level of invective. Kim Sterelny is a philosopher with a solid background in evolutionary theory, and in this book tells the tale of their disagreements with skill and journalistic polish.<br />Despite the bitterness of the debate, most of the issues Dawkins and Gould disagree on are either unscientific (e.g., militant atheism vs. tolerance for religion and other non-scientific forms of knowing) or matters of interpretive preference (e.g., the role of chance vs. selection in evolution, the extent to which evolution involves increasing complexity, the importance of population genetics vs. the study of large-scale patterns in the history of life, or the view of evolution as a conflict of genes vs. an organic conflict among species-level and higher biological forms). Other issues that separate them relate to the schools of thought to which they belong---Dawkins' friends being the sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists (G. Williams, W. Hamilton, E. O. Wilson, et al.) and Gould's being the left-wing critics of sociobiology (R. Lewontin, L. Kamin, et al.). By limiting the debate to Dawkins and Gould alone, the book does not flesh out this larger, and quite interesting intellectual opposition.<br />Sterelny neither takes sides nor tries to adjudicate the differences between these writers, though he does say that their differences appear to be narrowing over time. Being less unpresuming, I assess the situation as follows. Dawkins' gene-centered view makes for good journalism, but is fatally flawed for one simple reason: the heart of evolution is mutation and selection, not replication, which is simply an uncreative prerequisite for evolution. A mutation can spread only if it is more fit that existing alleles, and fitness is a frequency dependent, highly nonlinear phenomenon, best described by game theory on the level of phenotypes. Gould's mass extinctions and punctuated equilibria make perfect sense from evolutionary game theory, and involve nothing beyond mutation, selection, and replication. On the other hand, Gould's dismissal of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology are ideologically based and quite without merit.<br />Sterelny describes a debate that is more a reflection of the expansive egos of two great popularizers, and their inability to understand, or their reluctance to publicize, the work of younger generations of evolutionary biologists, rather than some real scientific clash of paradigms. But if it gets young people interested in evolutionary biology, I'm all for it, and Sterelny does a good job of dramatizing the debate.best described by game theory on the level of phenotypes.

'Empiricism' says the mind is a 'blank slate,' so languages and language acquisition are purely cultural matters. Among the leading nativists (who dominate the discipline of linguistics) are Chomsky, Pinker, Bickerton, and Jackendorff. Sampson's book is dedicated to showing they are wrong.<br />Sampson is a confident and vigorous writer. He aims a barrage of criticism against nativism, most of which I found less than convincing. Moreover, he offers as an alternative not a linguistic theory, but a general philosophical  approach, which he associates with Karl Popper. In my view, philosophy has its place in the world, but the philosophy of science is not an alternative to science. Therefore, Sampson provides no alternative, except that people 'learn by trial and error.' Thanks!<br />Here are some facts that support nativism: (a) all languages of the world have approximately the same complexity and share strong underlying structural commonalities; (b) children learn their native language very rapidly, and without being taught, whereas they learn other things (e.g., math, science, the arts, natural lore) relatively slowly and almost always with intensive instruction; (c) individuals raised without a native language never learn to speak fluently, later in life, when they encounter language;(d) isolated groups create their own languages (creoles) that are much like existing languages; (e) people with brain damage often lose extremely specific capacities--e.g., to name fruits, or form plurals.<br />This whole area of study is fraught with ambiguity, because we simply don't know how the brain processes language. Nativists appear to believe there are dedicated, hard-wired modules that efficiently process language, whereas neuroscientists do not find such modules, or believe such modules are the end-product of learning and development, not their starting-point. So there's a lot more to be said on this issue.<br />I am not a linguist, so I certainly admit that I may be in dire need of an education in this area. But at this point, I stand with the Nativists.hereas neuroscientists do not find such modules, or believe such modules are the end-product of learning and development, not their starting-point.

It purports to be about chemistry, and it has blurbs written by four Nobel Prize winners in Chemistry. The book claims it wants to restore chemistry to its rightful position among the natural sciences, having been relegated to a lowly position by New Age environmentalist non-think. However, the book spends most of its time on biochemistry, cell biology, and other biological topics!

We would measure the angles and distances, get the coefficients of elasticity of the balls and the bumpers, and we would solve a set of differential equations. But is that how the billiards player figures out what to do? Of course not! We don't know exactly what he would do, but if the authors of this book had their way, we'd give up on the differential equations (optimization theory) and find the &quot;fast and frugal heuristic&quot; actually used by the billiards player.<br />This book is the product of a conference of experts in the field. It includes wonderful contributions by the editors and their coworkers on how decisions are actually made, and argues persuasively that fast and frugal is almost as good as full optimization, and at much lower cost.<br />But the volume is a lot broader than that. It includes contributions on the role of emotions in decision-making (Dan Fessler), learning in animal societies (Keven Laland) and social insects (Thomas Seeley), and a lot of material on the role of culture in human societies (Boyd, Richerson, McCabe, Smith, Henrich, and others). This is important new material, very up to date.<br />Gigerenzter and Selten go to great lengths to cast aspersions on the old-fashioned &quot;optimization subject to constraints&quot; perspective, but their arguments are not persuasive. They make a category error: they maintain that models that use optimization assume that the agents the models describe use optimization. This is just silly. Just as the billiards player does not solve differential equations, decision-makers do not do complete optimization, even though we may use such models to describe their behavior.<br />The editors believe that optimization subject to constraints is dead in behavioral theory, but they're dead wrong. That's in fact what they are doing, but they prefer to call it &quot;bounded rationality.&quot;<br />Finally, I should note that the work of Eduardo Zambrano (look up his home page) shows that the SEU (Subjective Expected Utility model---the enemy of all bounded rationalers) actually is behaviorally universal, in the sense that one can always find a set of Bayesian priors for which an observed set of behaviors is optimal.<br />But don't let these petty methodological issues get you down. The book is a great collection by the authors of major work in behavioral theory.that the work of Eduardo Zambrano (look up his home page) shows that the SEU (Subjective Expected Utility model---the enemy of all bounded rationalers) actually is behaviorally universal, in the sense that one can always find a set of Bayesian priors for which an observed set of behaviors is optimal.<br />But don't let these petty methodological issues get you down.

The authors justify this message empirically and theoretically, while lamenting the tendency of most animal behaviorists to downplay the importance of learning and the causal feedback from social macrostructure to genetic microstructure.<br />Chapters 8 and 9 constitute the heart of this book, and Chapter 10 (the final chapter) provides an intelligent and thoughtful commentary on the implications of the book for research and even political philosophy. If I taught a course on animal behavior, I would start with a standard account (e.g., Alcock), but spend a fair amount of time at the end of the course on Chapters 8-10 of this book. The discription of the Baldwin effect, Waddington's empirical research, and the niche construction ideas of Odling-Smee and coauthors is particularly clear, important, and difficult to find elsewhere.<br />I am much less happy with the first 7 chapters of the book. Indeed, I am not sure who the intended audience is. There are many critiques of standard theories (e.g., inclusive fitness, gene-centered evolution, group selection, evolutionary psychology), but the theories they critique are not systematically presented, and what explanation they give generally appears in footnotes. This indicated the material is not for beginners, but for experts. However, the arguments against these &quot;enemies&quot; will appear sloppy and ill-considered to experts in the field---in sharp contrast to the presentation in the final three chapters.<br />Some of the critiques of standard theories are completely ignorant and off the mark, such as the critique of parental care theory on p. 166. If an undergraduate student had written that drivel, I would have sent the student back to the drawing board.<br />So careless are the remarks in these chapters that at times I was convinced they were parodying New Age mindlessness. For instance, the criticize Karl Marx for being a sexist when he wrote &quot;from each according to his ability,&quot; showing that he didn't care about women!!! If these foolish authors ever read the work of Marx, they would find Marx, like his contemporary J. S. Mill, to be in the forefront of sexual equality.<br />In general, the first seven chapters treat theory sloppily, treat evidency sloppily, and treat the relationship between the two sloppily. They often do not present alternative interpretations of their data, they treat other theories as straw men, they demand absolute proof of other theories, but accept offhand observation as &quot;proof&quot; of their own, and they routinely fail to qualify their statements. I would not want students to think this is the way scientists think. It is not.<br />Moreover, the authors have a strong political axe to grind. They hate &quot;sociobiology&quot; and &quot;evolutionary psychology&quot; as applied to humans. In particular, they believe that all differences among &quot;normal&quot; human individuals is environmentally determined (p. 48). This is my own area of expertise, and I can assure them that their position has virtually no evidence in its favor and a ton of evidence against it (they do not even mention the evidence, for or against, in this case).in these chapters that at times I was convinced they were parodying New Age mindlessness.

In particular, several authors, including Maynard Smith and Szathmary, Michod, and Keller (see his Princton U Press collection) have analyzed the development of multicellular organisms in a conflict/cooperation framework. The result is quite unfavorable to Dawkins' approach.<br />This book mentions the problem, but disposes of it so rapidly that virtually nothing of interest can possibly get through to the reader. Rather, this book is about the problem of replication error in copying dna. Ridley argues that the level of complexity of organisms is limited by their ability to sustain highly accurate copying, and that humans are about at the limit of this ability.<br />This is a interesting argument, but to my mind it isn't earth-shattering and it doesn't require a whole book to tell. Of course, you will learn a lot of biology in the telling (if you didn't know it already), and Ridley is a very good writer.<br />Ridley flirts with eugenics in the policy section of the book, lamenting that modern wealth, technology, and medicine allows lots of defective genes to proliferate in society, but he does not recommend doing anything about it---such as forcing people to abort imperfect fetuses. He argues that cloning shouldn't replace sexual reproduction because, whatever the value of sexual reproduction (Ridley is agnostic, but favor Kondrashov's model), it's clearly valuable. But we don't need a book or copying accuracy of dna to tell us that.<br />In sum, nothing monumental here, but very nice if you want to learn a little about how modern biologists think, and what they think about.	2001-09-01

Their ideas were received rather well from the start, but in recent years, their alternative, which we can fairly call &quot;behavioral economics&quot; has virtually displaced traditional decision theory as an active research area.<br />People often think of the Kahneman-Tversky behaviorists as &quot;bomb-throwers&quot; in the sense that they appear to love to destroy traditional concepts of rationality rather that put constructive models in their place. This collection, which consists of 42 very high quality essays by the leading lights of the field, shows clearly that this is not the case. Prospect theory, loss aversion, framing effets, status quo effect, and the like are carefully modeled in this book. I came away quite impressed.<br />It is a shame that Amos Tversky never lived to see the light of day of this fine volume. It is certainly a vigorous vindication of his lifetime research agenda.	2001-08-24

This edited collection shows that the approach he has been working on for the past several years, has finally come of age.<br />The first synthesis of law and economics took place several decades ago, based on the seminal work of Nobel prize winning Chicago economist Ronald Coase. The synthesis was based on the so-called &quot;rational actor model&quot; (often called homo Economicus) that can be derived from certain axiomatic, mathematics-like principles, based on the notion of self-interest and utility maximization. This was a major breakthrough in social theory and policy.<br />But the &quot;rational actor model&quot; has been shown to be systematically violated by real human beings, and behavioral economics arose to ammend the &quot;rational actor model&quot; to fit the reality. It's not that people are irrational, but rather the concept of rationality used in the traditional theory is seriously wanting. If you're interested in this larger backdrop to the present book, there is a marvelous new book on the subject edited by its creators, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, called &quot;Choices, Values, and Frames.&quot;<br />The introductory chapters of Behavioral Law and Economics are refreshingly clear and free of jargon. These are followed by some of the most important articles that have been written on the topic over the past several years.<br />Behavioral law and economics is not just some academic field. It is absolutely, front and center, critical to political philosophy and the policy sciences in general. This book is for both expert and layperson alike---a real tour de force.	2001-08-23

His professional work is extremely careful, quantitative, and innovative. I was surprised to find a different side of this impressive animal behaviorist in this charming little book. Gadagkar has an admirable ability to explain complex biological theory without recourse to complicated terminology and equations.<br />The centerpiece of Gadagkar's interpretation of cooperation and conflict in animal societies is Hamilton's inequality, which says that individuals will, in the long run, help others at a cost to themselves, if the benefit to the others times their relatedness to the helper is greater than the cost to the helper. This simple little equation is a powerful leitmotif that runs through each and every example in this book. And the examples are extremely elegant and memorable---reading this reminded me of when I read Ray Bradbury's Illustrated Man when I was a kid, so wide ranging and daring are his examples---except that in this case what is being described is scientifically impeccable.<br />This book is great for beginners in sociobiology and animal behavior, but it is also a wonderful treat for those (like myself) who have read widely in the field.<br />There are two areas of cooperation/conflict that Gadagkar does not touch. The first is homo sapiens. You'll have to look elsewhere for the sociobiology of humans. The second is cooperation/conflict among cells in multicellular organisms. I recommend the collection edited by Laurent Keller (Princeton University Press) for an introduction to the latter.	2001-08-21

But this summer I bit the bullet, and I've started using C++ in my work. What changed my mind was the Borland C++ Builder compiler, which makes it easy to write applications. I found that C++ was as complex as I expected, but quite fast and versatile. This book really helped me understand the design philosophy of C++, so I feel much more at home with the language than I did just a few days ago. I can't imagine that this book would be good for a beginner at programming, though, since it throws around computer science terminology quite freely (early binding, late binding, for instance), and without much explanation.	2001-08-13

Since we are a biological species that has evolved an extremely powerful form of sociality, how could a scientist studying human society NOT be a sociobiologist?<br />The answer to this question is simple, and is well laid out by Alcock: if the human brain has evolved into a general purpose instrument on which knowledge, culture, and behavioral norms can be written as though it were a blank slate, then there would be no need to study the biology of social behavior. Despite the overwhelming evidence against the blank slate belief---an impressive amount of the evidence is carefully presented and clearly explained by Alcock---many social scientists and science journalists refuse to believe it.<br />Alcock makes a valiant attempt to show that the reasons given for rejecting sociobiology are specious. The most important scientific critique is that we need powerful and accurate models of human behavior, not simply vague and unprovable evolutionary just-so stories purporting to explain human behavior. Alcock shows that evolutionary thinking provides an incredibly rich source of hypotheses concerning behavior, so is the essential basis for conceiving of plausible models of behavior. In no way does evolutionary thinking substitute for analytical model building and testing.<br />But virtually all of the hostility to sociobiology is motivated not by scientific interests, but rather by political interests. Alcock exhibits skill and patience in both demonstrating  the errors in reasoning in politically-motivated attacks on sociobiology, and showing that sociobiology is in fact neither hostile to nor partial to any particular political position. For instance, he explains that the fact that there is a natural explanation for certain immoral behaviors (e.g., neglecting stepchildren, male philandering, ethnocentrism) does not justify these behaviors or suggest that they are inevitable.<br />I think, however, sociobiology does conflict with certain strongly held positions common on both the right and the left wings of the political spectrum. The hallmark of many politically committed people (and social theorists), I believe, is the belief in the attainability of a social utopia based on eradicating the social influences that lead to 'evil' behavior, and socializing people to conform to a utopian vision of behavior and belief. For such a vision to be possible, one must hold the 'blank slate' model that sociobiogists have shown not to exist. To my mind, this is the most important contribution of sociobiology to making a better world: utopian visions based on blank slate models of the human mind do not work and never will. Let's get on we making a better world with what we have: human nature as it is, not as we would have it be.nk, however, sociobiology does conflict with certain strongly held positions common on both the right and the left wings of the political spectrum.

The same can be said even more strongly for a biological concept of &quot;ethnicity.&quot; Yet human beings are keenly sensitive to both &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; as biological concepts; i.e., people widely feel connected by kinship and geneology to others of their group---the insiders--- and are very willing to extend this feeling to mistrust and hatred of other groups---the outsiders.<br />Racial and ethnic prejudices are unmitigated evils, but they can be eliminated only if we understand them from a scientific point of view.<br />According to the dominant paradigm in social theory for much of the previous two centuries, human beings are an ideological 'tabula rasa' on which virtually any array of cultural beliefs and values can be inscribed through the appropriate socialization practices. This view suggests that prejudices can be eliminated by simply teaching people that they are wrong.<br />But many students of human society, myself included, have found that human beings have a certain predilection for prejudice and ethnic hatred. This prejudice is easily aroused and leads people to make great personal sacrifices in supporting &quot;their own.&quot; Ethnic conflict today is doubtless the leading cause of war and the violation of personal rights, not to mention a major force in preventing economic and political development around the world.<br />This book, which included contributions by the editors as well as about two dozen experts in various areas of behavioral theory, attempts to develop an alternative behavioral perspective, in which a predisposition to favor insiders and punish outsiders, even at a fitness cost to oneself, is somehow innately human. However, unlike many innately human traits, which are exhibited in virtually all societies (see Donald E. Brown, Human Universals (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1991), ethnic prejudice is often absent and must be evokes by charismatic leaders or social conditions. For this reason the editors call this predisposition an &quot;evolved trait of indoctrinability,&quot; and the other contributors follow their lead.<br />Ethnic conflict and Indoctrination is a very fine sourcebook for those who would model the physiology, varienty, and dynamics of ethnic prejudice, but it does not produce answers. This is in part because most of the contributions aim to provide partial insights into the issue by close analysis of particular aspects of the problem. It is also because no one has a generally plausible model of why human beings are so willing to incur fitness costs on themselves on behalf of groups of virtually unrelated individuals. By far the most useful analytical paper in the book, to my mind, is that of Peter Richerson and Robert Boyd, &quot;The Evolution of Human Ultrasociality,&quot; who make it clear that the same evolutionary and behavioral mechanisms that account for cooperation and prosociality in humans is doubtless also responsible for ethnic hatred and the predisposition toward violence.ver, unlike many innately human traits, which are exhibited in virtually all societies (see Donald E.

Binmore reports extensively on contemporary ethnographies of hunter-gatherer societies, believing that such societies mirror the social and material conditions the human race faced during its formative period as a species. Such societies have no division of labor except for gender, and are politically egalitarian, decision-making power being quite equally distributed among the adult males of the community. Binmore infers that fairness norms must be self-enforcing, and cannot depend on a hierarchical leader (a &quot;philosopher-king&quot;) to enforce ethical principals. Moreover, since a division of labor (except for gender) is absent, deliberations in such groups approximate the `original position.'<br />Binmore thus offers us a &quot;coevolution of genes and culture&quot; in which the acceptance of original position moral arguments is written into our genes, but the cultural content depends on local environmental conditions and random variation. Again drawing on the ethnographic literature, Binmore focuses on food sharing as the most important rule of justice to be decided by a foraging group. In foraging societies, high variance foodstuffs such as meat are equally shared, irrespective of who made the kill. Equal sharing is thus a moral rule justified by reasoning from the original position of hunters who do not know exactly which among them will be lucky or skilled.<br />Binmore uses evolutionary game theory to analyze social interactions. This adds a welcome degree of clarity to ethical reasoning. Indeed, Binmore is quite clear that all of his substantive results depend on the plausibility of the game theoretic models he presents and analyzes.<br />While fairness norms are biologically determined for Binmore, the players in Binmore's games are rational self-interested agents. Thus all of the results of two-person game theory based on the rational actor model can be deployed in analyzing social justice. It follows in particular that &quot;[i]n a well-ordered society, each citizen honors the social contract because it is in his own self-interest to do so, provided that enough of his fellow citizens do the same.&quot; (5) There is no sense in which moral behavior is opposed to self-interested behavior. Moreover, since players do not behave ethically in bargaining, there is no sense in which the institutions resulting from their bargaining have any abstract normative standing. &quot;Evolutionists simply seek to understand,&quot; says Binmore, &quot;why some types of human organization survive better than others.... evolutionary ethics offers no authority whatsoever to those who wish to claim that some moral systems are somehow intrinsically superior to others.' (179)<br />Different societies can thus embrace different institutions because comparisons in the original position depend on `empathetic preferences' that are culturally specific. It is in part for this reason that Binmore calls himself a `whig,' by which he means a moderate progressive, not seduced by the grand visions of a totally alternative society as proposed by the Left and the Right. The latter two, he claims, make social judgments in a universal, ahistorical manner that have nothing to do with the actual fairness processes in real societies.<br />Just Playing is an important and welcome contribution to the literature. The book does, however, have some faults. The most salient is that crucial analytical material and discursive asides jumbled together. One must read the whole book, and make numerous references back and forth, to understand the basic argument. Moreover, the book is intended for a general audience interested in political philosophy, yet even professional economists will find the analytical parts difficult to follow.<br />Another problem is that Binmore uses evolutionary game theory where it suits him, but abandons it when it does not. For instance, while Binmore uses naturalism to justify the assertion that Homo sapiens is genetically programed to accept the original position, but he gives no empirical evidence that this is in fact the case. Moreover, it is implausible that evolution imprinted us with an original position orientation, but in no other way affected our moral behavior, so that the assumption of Homo economicus remains valid for bargaining purposes. Laboratory experiments reveal forms of prosocial behavior (e.g., rejecting `unfair' offers in an ultimatum game, or punishing free riders in a public goods game) that relate directly to questions of justice and fairness, yet contradict the Homo economicus model. The notion that human sociality can be explained by `enlightened self-interest,' even when accompanied by respect for the original position, will not likely survive a close study of the evidence (See my book Game Theory Evolving, Princeton University Press, 2000).t abandons it when it does not.

We are told that perpetrators of antisocial acts do not consider themselves evil, and often consider their acts justified, or not of great importance. We are told that people seek revenge because their self-esteem is threatened. We are told that drugs and alcohol do not induce people to perform evil deeds, but rather allow people to perform deeds they would otherwise have restrained themselves from performing. We are told that many evil-doers are self-centered and uncaring of others. We are told that we could all behave in an &quot;evil&quot; manner under the right circumstances.<br />This is all drivel, of course, masquerading as science. None of these statements is subjected to anything like scientific scrutiny. Most of them are obvious (e.g. perpetrators say they don't care about their victims) or false (revenge occurs because people's self-esteem is threatened) or meaningless (most of the sentences in the book fall under this category, since most of the emotions and forms of consciousness described are of the offhand, pop psychology type).<br />So, if you want to read about lots of dirty stuff people have done to one another, this is your book. And if you like to think your reading is enlightening and informative without actually dealing with the difficult analytical and quantitative tasks of modeling and testing human behavior, this is your book.<br />My only consolation in purchasing this book is that is was cheap, yet quite nicely put together. Also, it gives me a chance to write a nasty review. I take revenge no doubt beause of a threat to my self-esteem, no doubt.	2001-02-04

This book purports to analyze the psychopathic personality, but fails miserably. The author spends most of his time entertaining the reader with the goulish exploits of famous serial murderers and other notorious killers, yet has not the slightest evidence that they are psychopaths. Moreover, Hare stereotypes psychpaths rather than analyzing them. All the people he interviews and describes are good looking, intelligent, verbal, social charmers, impulsive, glib and lie extensively. Each and every one, mind you. The real world of psychopaths is more nuanced.<br /><br />Virtually all of the evidence presented concerning the psychology of psychopathy are from interviews and writings of the psychopaths themselves. But if they lie freely and without compunction, why should we believe their own stories? There is, of course, absolutely no reason. Moreover, we know that some psychopaths are quite sadistic (they torture their victims, kill animals) while others are simply devoid of feeling for others. Shouldn't these be two different types of personality syndrome?<br /><br />This is a very good read with lots of gruesome titillation. Dr. Hare evidently wrote a Psychopathy Checklist, but we never get to see it, or to find out why it's a valid indicator of anything. I didn't learn much from this shallow volume.	2001-02-04

If you have little tolerance for the fashionable jargon of postmodern criticism, you will delight in the way Sokal has put the screws on the pretensions of this pompous movement.<br />One of Sokal's important contributions is to quote liberally from the postmodern gurus of the French academic establishment. Reading Lacan, Derrida, Deleuze and Guattarri, and their colleagues for meaning is virtually impossible (the French, by the way, is no more lucid than the English translations), so the several quotes from their work in Sokal's essay are about as close as any rational reader will get to their work.<br />But what they say is indeed hilarious. Here is Derrida: &quot;The Einsteinian constant is not a constant, is not a center. It is the very concept of variablity--it is, finally, the concept of the game.&quot; This, of course, means absolutely nothing--even in context. But at least it is not wrong, as is the following from Lacan: &quot;This diagram [the Mobius strip] can be considered the basis of a sort of essential inscription at the origin, in the knot which constitutes the subject...it explains many things about the structure of mental disease. If one can symbolize the subject by this fundamental cut, in the same way one can show that a cut on a torus corresponds to the neurotic subject, and on a cross-cut surface to another sort of mental disease.&quot; Lacan is justly famous--here we see him taking silly to the heights of sublimity.<br />Here is Lacan again: &quot;...human life could be defined as a calculus in which zero was irrational. When I say 'irrational' I'm referring not to some unfathomable emotional state but precisely to what is call ian imaginary number.&quot; How incredibly erudite-sounding to define human life as a &quot;calculus&quot; (whatever that is) in which zero is &quot;irrational&quot; and in which &quot;irrational&quot; means &quot;imaginary.&quot; This is really rich!<br />There are some excellent essays in this book, besides that of Sokal. These include excellent pieces by Steven Weinberg (the physicist), Paul Boghossian (the philosopher), Meera Nanda (scientist/journalist), and Barbara Epstein. My favorite one-liner is Weinberg's tale of a physicist friend who, on his death bed, confesses to draw some consolation from the fact that at least he won't have to look up the meaning of 'hermeneutic' any more in the dictionary.<br />My favorite humor book is Woody Allen's Without Feathers.

Usually this was supported by arguing that human culture is so variable and human nature so malleable that we have virtually completely transcended our animal roots.<br />E. O. Wilson's great book, Sociobiology (1975) changed all that. Despite ferocious opposition to the idea that humans are animals deeply affected by their evolutionary history (Wilson was called a racist and a fascist by very eminent biologists and anthropologists), a whole generation of young researchers got the message, and  began producing extremely valuable studies confirming that many aspects of human psychology and human social organization could be better appreciated by treating humans as the product of evolution, and using methods little different from the study of primates, and even birds and insects.<br />This book is an edited collection of some of the major research efforts undertaken by these evolutionary psychologists, sociobiologists, and behavioral ecologists. The research is for the most part not armchair theorizing, but the analysis of painfully collected and minutely analyzed data on small scale societies. After two chapters of nicely developed theory, the book offers five chapters on mating, followed by another five chapters on parenting.<br />The book then attacks a major problem in sociobiology: the demographic transition, which occurred in Europe a century ago, and is occuring in many developing nations today. The demographic transition consists of a fall in the birth rate following a rise in per capital income---an event that is quite unexpected, since sociobiology is based on the notion that humans are/were in their evolutionary history, fitness maximizers. The most plausible explanation, offered by Kaplan and Lancaster, is that humans do not maximize fitness, but rather a combination of fitness and welfare. The implications of this for social theory are immense, and begin to draw sociobiology back into conformance with economic theory, which stresses utility maximization.<br />The book then presents four papers on human sociality. These papers, while quite impressive, are to my mind excessively closely tied to Robert Triver's notion of reciprocal altruism, and more broadly, Richard Alexander's slightly broader notion of indirect altruism. I think recent evidence fairly conclusively shows that human behavior is not self-interested even in the widest sense, and some theory of multilevel selection and/or culture/gene coevolution is needed to explain human sociality in an acceptable manner.<br />But these are quibbles on the edge of current research, and should by no means deter the interested reader from profiting from these exciting and impressive articles.ans do not maximize fitness, but rather a combination of fitness and welfare.

The traditional answer are from God, as revealed by theologians, or from Reason or Intuition, as revealed by philosophers. In fact, as Richard Alexander makes clear in this landmark book, morality comes from our evolution as a species. Individuals who developed ethical awareness and practiced moral behavior in the course of our emergence from the hoard of pre-human hominids had an evolutionary edge over those who did not. It follows that to understand morality, one must undertake a scientific and evolutionary approach. Ethics is thus something like linguistics, in that both are extremely complex human ideational forms that must be modeled, and the success of ethical theories is their capacity to explain how humans express and make moral choices.<br /><br />The scientific approach to morality espoused by Alexander is a deeply refreshing alternative to the endless pious platitudes of the theologians, who believe they have a special line to the Almighty's will, and the supercilious meanderings of the philosophers who think their personal moral predilections are something more than mere personal prejudice. We owe to this book the reorientation of ethical theory from the prejudices of the privileged to the realm of the scientific. As such, Alexander's book is must reading for a student of ethics.<br /><br />However, contemporary evidence shows that his major thesis is flawed. Here are some key quotes and my critique of the assertions made in the quotes.<br /><br />Quote from p. 3: \\"ethics, morality, human conduct, and the human psyche are to be understood only if societies are seen as collections of individuals seeking their own self-interest...\\"<br /><br />Critique: This is of course the model of human action in standard economic theory, and I have spent my whole life dealing with its inadequacies and proposing alternative models more in line with the empirical evidence on human behavior. Alexander's description of human behavior ignores such prosocial other-regarding behaviors as altruistic cooperation, altruistic punishment, and the tendency to conform to social norms independent from the possibility of being detected and punished for such behavior. We now have lots of behavioral evidence in favor of the existence of strong reciprocity (a propensity to cooperate in social dilemmas and to punish free riders without regard to personal material payoffs), as well as its ability to foster sustainable cooperation when self-interest would lead to social breakdown. See, for instance Herbert Gintis, \\"Strong Reciprocity and Human Sociality\\", Journal of Theoretical Biology 206 (2000):169-179 and Ernst Fehr and Simon Gaechter, \\"Cooperation and Punishment\\", American Economic Review 90,4 (2000). See also my web site.<br /><br />I also believe that empathy and shame are counterexamples to Alexander's model. Indeed, sociopaths who have neither empathy nor shame can be considered as \\"self-interested\\" in Alexander's sense in that they refrain from harming other human beings only if they calculate that the personal costs (e.g., of being caught) exceed the benefits flowing from harming others.<br /><br />Quote from p. 34: \\"That people are in general following what they perceive to be their own interests is, I believe, the most general principle of human behavior.\\"<br /><br />If this is not tautologous (whatever people want to do is in their interest by definition), then it is false, for the same reason as in my critique of the previous quote, since people who punish violators of group norms often \\"perceive\\" their actions to be for the benefit of the group, and understand quite well that it is not in their own self-interest.<br /><br />But there are other problems with Alexander's statement. (a) If I am addicted to smoking I might perceive that I am not acting in my own self interest when I smoke, and do it anyway. (b) I may  \\"perceive\\" it in my own interest to help the poor, or contribute to environmental groups, or perform other prosocial acts when in fact it is not. If humans systematically misperceive their self-interest, as in this case, and if the misperception is very likely in a prosocial direction, then violations of self-interest might be central to human social cooperation, even were Alexander's statement correct (which it is not). In fact, I do not believe that humans systematically misperceive their self-interest. Rather, they choose often to act altruistically against their self-interest because they have other-regarding preferences.<br /><br />Quote from p. 77: \\"Moral systems are systems of indirect reciprocity.\\"<br /><br />This is the first statement of Chapter 2, \\"A Biological View of Morality.\\" It is not an aside, but Alexander's fundamental explanation of moral systems. By \\"indirect reciprocity\\" he means almost exactly what Robert Trivers calls \\"reciprocal altruism,\\" but which in fact is just enlightened long-term self interest. It is fundamentally wrong. The evidence is that virtually all moral systems exhort forms of altruism that do not reduce to self interest, even in the long run, and large numbers of people subscribe to and to some extent follow these non-self-interested principles.<br /><br />I should note that even criminals and psychopaths often exhibit non-self-regarding behavior, as when, for instance, a man takes revenge on his \\"enemies\\" and then kills himself.<br /><br />Of course, a lot of human behavior is self-interested, and some non-self-interested behavior is just random noise in the behavioral system. But the types of systematic prosocial behavior promoted by strong reciprocity, shame, empathy, and identification with \\"insiders\\" is, unless I am mistaken, the key to the particular strength of human cooperation.ystematically misperceive their self-interest, as in this case, and if the misperception is very likely in a prosocial direction, then violations of self-interest might be central to human social cooperation, even were Alexander's statement correct (which it is not).

First, he reviews an extensive body of modern behavioral ecology. If you've never encountered the treatment of culture in contemporary evolutionary psychology, behavioral ecology, or biological anthropology, this book provides a very nice introduction. Second, Cronk argues that behavioral ecologists have understated the role of culture, and suggests how it be integrated into an overall theory of human behavior.<br />Towards the first goal, Cronk opposes the traditional notion in cultural anthropology and structural-functional sociology that holds that people's actions and values are reflections of the dominant culture. In Chapter 1, he gives several elegant examples of how people affirm their culture, while at the same time behaving in ways quite contrary to its dictates. In Chapter 2 he reviews the evidence that there is a universal human culture, and that it is rooted in human biology. The evidence is impressive and strong. In Chapter 3 he argues for the unity of the behavioral sciences around the coevolution of human genes and culture, and the marginalization of ethical philosophy that results from increasing scientific knowledge of human behavior. He illustrates this in Chapter 4 with a review on the universalities and particularities of human mating patterns, on which there is much evidence, most of which is quite hostile to the traditional notion that humans are highly manipulable through the proper acculturation. In perhaps the most original chapter in the book, Chapter 7, he argues that traditional cultural relativism is a vicious enemy of freedom, thus turning a traditional critique of sociobiology on its head. I am in complete agreement with him here.<br />Cronk begins his own approach with a review of memetics, which is an evolutionary model of cultural diffusion. I think memetics is incurably fuzzy and quite useless for analytical purposes (mostly because it provides no theory of when memes spread and when they die out), but Cronk is a bit more tolerant. In Chapter 5, he provides his own theory of culture, which is that culture is a set of tools that people use to achieve their own ends. In this approach, people are active participants in making their lives, not the passive dupes who simply play out their culturally-dictated roles, as in most of traditional social theory. I am partial to this view. Indeed, I wrote a long article on the subject in 1981, and it appears front and center in Samuel Bowles and my Democracy and Capitalism (Basic Books, 1985).<br />I have two criticisms of the book. First, culture is not merely a tool. It also sets up conventions that give rise to what game theorists call Nash equilibria, in which, given the behavior of others, one's optimal behavior is quite narrowly truncated. This 'conventional' notion of culture must appear along side and instrumental view of culture. Second, I think we need analytical, mathematical models of behavior, without which all the theorizing in the world is just so much talk. Cronk doesn't go into this side of behavioral ecology, and in particular does not do justice to Boyd and Richerson, Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, and others who try to model gene-culture coevolution.ad and when they die out), but Cronk is a bit more tolerant.

A beehive has workers who police the  behavior of other workers to ensure that work gets done and that only  queens lay eggs. Without such disciplinarians, the hive would soon fail.  Humans have evolved internal behavioral structures that allow us to  cooperate in society, and impel us to punish non-cooperators.<br />All of  these are instances of multilevel selection, as discussed in this fine book  of essays. Some readers will be startled to find this material instead of  the ancient debates over individual vs. group selection and self-interest  vs. altruism---the place where the debate over multilevel selection began  in the mid-1960's. The contributors are tops in their respective fields,  including H. Kerne Reeve, Eors Szathmary, Richard Michod, Andrew  Pomiankowski, Craig Packer, John Maynard Smith, and other equally fine  biologists. Their uniting in this book shows that the group selection  debate is over, at least among the knowledgeable.<br />I loved this book, and  have spent many hours following up on the other writings of the authors,  both in book and article form. This book suggests what I have long had a  suspicion is the case: all of biology is sociobiology, in the sense that  whenever you have organisms consisting of more than one type of cell that  cooperate in making a whole, you have social mechanisms involved in  mediating among the divergent interests of the individual parts, and  structures emerge that more or less successfully resolve the mediation  problems. Darwinian selection then operates upon these mediating  structures, yet in no way different from, or even in addition to, the way  selection operates on individual genes.	2000-07-27

For instance, all differences between  men and women were considered cultural, and the talents, aptitude, and  personality of individuals was attributed completely to their  upbringing.<br />That model has been repeatedly falsified in recent years  through a wide array of empirical data. Moreover, our increasing ability to  located the neurological bases of human sociality and to discover the  genetic bases for some diseases has led to a complete turn-around in the  public perception of the relative importance of genes and environment in  influencing human behavior and health.<br />The popular understanding of these  scientific advances often takes the form of &quot;its hereditary, so  there's nothing we can do about it.&quot; This book is a serious and  informed attempt to show that this interpretation is dead wrong. The book  is not light reading---it takes seriously the task at hand, and it assumes  the reader is willing to follow a complex scientific argument. But by doing  so, the reader will be well rewarded.<br />The main point of the book is this:  the fact that something is hereditary to a given degree says something  about the interaction of people with their environment. When heredity is  high (as in the case of height, or IQ) it does not mean that we cannot find  environments in which we can increase people's height, or equalize their  IQ's. Moreover, to a significant extent, people create their own  environments (niches), which appear mathematically as a product of genes,  but misleadingly so.<br />For instance, height is highly heritable, but  succeeding generations of Americans are consistently taller than their  parents. IQ is heritable, but IQ scores rise dramatically from generation  to generation (the Flynn effect).<br />The new genetic research should not  make us conservative and defeatist concerning the possibilities of  improving the welfare of humanity, but rather guide and inform us in how to  search for more effective environmental interventions.<br />There are problems  with Kaplan's book, however, and they are serious. First, he blames the  common public view of the matter on the researchers (&quot;Lies&quot;),  when almost all in the field (including me) agree wholly with his analysis,  and say it again and again in print! Kaplan considers the new research  something of a right wing conspiracy against the welfare state, which is  just nonesense. He trots out the book by Herrnstein and Murray again and  again as an example, when he must know that virtually the whole behavioral  genetics community has criticized it vigorously. There are NO examples in  his book, as far as I can tell, where the researchers are at fault.<br />In  fact, I see this reaction to behavioral genetics a lot from  well-intentioned, progressive people, who wish we were back in the Good Old  Days of the SSSM, where proper socialization and spending plenty of money  were considered sufficient to solve social problems. Well, it just ain't  so. We will not get social policy on track in eliminating poverty, sexism,  racism, or any of the other ills that Kaplan (and I) bemoan, until we work  out the proper interaction of human nature, genetic potential, and  environmental interaction. Just criticizing the scientists won't get us  anywhere, I am afraid.(the Flynn effect).<br />The new genetic research should not  make us conservative and defeatist concerning the possibilities of  improving the welfare of humanity, but rather guide and inform us in how to  search for more effective environmental interventions.<br />There are problems  with Kaplan's book, however, and they are serious.

Then Hofbauer and Sigmund's new book (a totally revised  version of their earlier Theory of Evolution and Dynamical Systems) came  out, and I knew I had a masterpiece in hand.<br />The book does not assume the  reader knows basic differential equation theory--it presents all the theory  necessary. Indeed, it is a wonderful way to learn differential equation  theory, since one immediately is faced with meaningful problems to solve.  It does assume the reader is familiar with multivariate calculus. The book  should be accessible to biologists and game theorists with a minimum  understanding of each other's disciplines.<br />There are four parts. First,  HS deal with Lotka-Volterra equations of the type prevalent in  predator-prey models, which they extend to ecological models and several  populations. Like the rest of the book, there are lots of problems and the  presentation is elegant and succinct.<br />The second part deals with game  theory dynamics and replicator equations, including sections on  evolutionary games and asymmetric games. This too is extremely nicely  presented, and the links to the Lotka-Volterra models are made  clear.<br />Part three is on dynamical systems especially of relevance to  biochemistry--catalytic hypercycles--as well as higher dimensional phase  space dynamics of ecological models.<br />Part four deal with population  genetic models using a differential equation approach. This section is also  excellent, though for serious readers it should be complemented by Karlin  and Taylor's Second Course in Stochastic Processes (which is much more  mathematically demanding).<br />The physical production of the book is also  first rate--a pleasure to read and use.	2000-07-13

Arnhart's contribution is  Aristotelian, in that this philosopher started from the natural position of  humanity (e.g., we are a zoon politican--a social animal) rather than from  Plato's Ideal World. Arnhart is a Darwinian, in that our constitution as a  specied derives from our evolutionary history.<br />This book can be read with  profit by professional philosophers as well as beginners interested in  understanding evolutionary ethics. It is clear and systematic, avoids  jargon, and amply discusses alternative views.<br />I take issue with one part  of Arnhart's analysis. I learned that &quot;the good is the desirable&quot;  in my graduate student days in economics. I have always thought this quite  incorrect (I wrote my Ph.D. dissertation on the topic!). For instance, I  may desire potato chips (or heroin) but not consider it good, and may  indeed wish that I did not desire these things. In place of Arnhart's  principle, I would suggest &quot;The good is what allows us to flourish and  to use our natural capacities to the fullest.&quot; The idea of flourishing  as a criterion is associated with Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen and  others, and the idea of developing one's capacities to the fullest is  associated with the young Karl Marx, in his Economic and Philosophical  Manuscripts of 1844.<br />At any rate, virtually all of Arnhart's arguments go  through with this minor change.<br />People like me, behavioral scientists,  tend to ignore ethical philosophy and have contempt for its practitioners  because it tries to find ethical truths independent from the natural  position of human beings in the world. Arnhart is a wonderful antidote to  this tendency, maintaining a high level of both philosophical and  scientific reasoning.	2000-07-03

To find the best way to present various materials, I went through virtually every game theory book in existence. For the  presentation of the basic material on normal and extensive form games,  nothing even came close to this book in clarity of presentation and depth  of understanding of the issues. Most textbooks, even highly touted ones  that are mathematically challenging, do not even come close, and rarely  even present the material in a coherent form at all.<br />I used to do a lot  of carpentry, and I always knew the good carpenters from the run of the  mill. The latter talk about how to build stuff. The good ones talked about  how you choose, preserve, treat, and sharpen your tools. Myerson is, for  game theory, like the good carpenter, and this book is more about the  nature of the tools of game theory than their deployment--although it is  certainly that, too.<br />The subtitle of this book is silly (&quot;The  Analysis of Conflict&quot;). Game theory is the analysis of cooperation as  much as conflict, and much, much else as well. So is this book.	2000-06-12

Many have viewed this book as narrow-minded and reductionist, an extended argument that all humanly relevant phenomena can be \\"reduced to physics.\\" This, I think, is a very narrow misreading of Wilson's argument. Indeed, I found Consilience itself to be a carefully unified exercise in natural science/social science/artistic creation. Wilson has a shining human vision of the unity of cognition, emotion, and spirit that transcends traditional classificatory boundaries. \\"Neither science nor the arts can be complete without combining their separate strengths,\\" says Wilson. \\"Science needs the intuition and the metaphorical power of the arts, and the arts need the fresh blood of science.\\" (p. 230) Moreover, Wilson locates exactly the transmission channel between science and the arts. \\"Interpretation,\\" he claims, \\"is the logical channel of consilient explanation between science and the arts.\\" (p. 230)<br /><br />Wilson's basic argument is rather metaphysical and must, I believe, be taken on faith. \\"There is intrinsically only one  class of explanation,\\" he holds. \\"The central idea of consilience world view is that all tangible phenomena, from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics.\\" (p. 291) Wilson is not horribly dogmatic about this faith---he argues that there is increasing evidence for it, but he is prepared for its falsification if future evidence warrants it. Wilson's faith is not severely reductionist because he sees the relationship between levels of complexity as a dialectic of reduction of the complex to its parts, and the synthesis of the whole from its parts, in full recognition that the backward movement is much simpler than the forward. Wilson recognizes the concept of complexity, according to which a higher level of organization cannot be predicted or fully understood in terms of the characteristics of its parts, but he does not go the whole complexity distance, which involves maintaining that a complex system has emergent properties that cannot, perhaps even in principle, be inferred from the characteristics of its parts. Indeed, the term \\"emergence\\" does not appear in the index to Consilience. Nevertheless, Wilson's description of a consilient analysis of a complex structure (e.g., a eukaryotic cell) is quite detailed and to my mind accurate. He certainly never says we can capture the complex whole as the sum of its simpler constituents, although he correctly affirms that we should try to do so and may in important cases be successful.<br /><br />To give a flavor of Wilson's argument, consider the following. \\"To dissect a phenomenon into its elements, in this case the cell into organelles and molecules, is consilience by reduction. To reconstitute it,  and especially to predict with knowledge gained by reduction how nature assembled it in the first place, is consilience by synthesis. That is the two-step procedure by which natural scientists generally work: top-down across three or four levels of organization at a time by analysis, then bottom up across the same levels by synthesis.\\" (p. 74).  Now, this is a grand description, but highly idealized. Certainly knowledge at a lower level is critical for understanding how a higher level works, but when there are emergent properties to the higher level, the synthesis of the lower level information is in itself incapable of reconstructing the whole. For instance, quantum mechanics is useful for analyzing the structure of chemical molecules, but is incapable of generating the higher level molecular models. Similarly, solid state physics helps understand the computer, but computer sciences is light-years away from being a branch of applied solid-state physics.<br /><br />Wilson wants to see the unification of three spheres of human knowledge: natural science, social science, and the humanities/arts. As I pointed out above, \\"interpretation\\" is the key link between science and the arts. Wilson does not elaborate on this link, and I am not sure it has been followed up in the literature in the twelve years since Consilience was published.  The link between natural science and social science, by contrast, is quite carefully elaborated. This link is \\"gene-culture coevolution.\\" Since this phenomenon is part of biology, Wilson obtains the natural-social science link by placing biology among the natural sciences. This is fair enough, although I generally place the part of biology that deals with behavior, especially social behavior, in the \\"behavioral sciences, which in addition include economics, sociology, psychology, anthropology, and political science.<br /><br />For Wilson's purposes, including biology in the natural sciences and seeing gene-culture coevolution as the major linking mechanism is perfectly acceptable. In my own treatment of the unification of the behavioral sciences (The Bounds of Reason, Princeton, 2009), I argue that gene-culture coevolution is the first and most basic of five principles bridging the various social science disciplines. Because gene-culture coevolution is a key element of sociobiology, it is not surprising that Wilson was among the first to discuss the mechanism, positing the \\"culturgen\\" parallel to the \\"gene\\" as units of evolutionary dynamics (C. J. Lumsden and E. O. Wilson Genes, Mind, and Culture, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1981). Other key figures in the development were Luca Cavalli-Sforza and Marcus Feldman Cultural Transmission<br />and Evolution, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 1981), and Robert Boyd and Peter J. Richerson, Culture and the Evolutionary Process, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1985).<br /><br />What is gene-culture coevolution? Because of the importance of culture and complex social organization to the evolutionary success of Homo sapiens, individual fitness in humans depends on the structure of social life. Because culture is both constrained and promoted by the human genome, human cognitive, affective, and moral capacities are the product of an evolutionary dynamic involving the interaction of genes and culture. We call this dynamic gene-culture coevolution. This coevolutionary process has endowed humans with preferences that go beyond the self-regarding concerns emphasized in traditional economic and pre-sociobiology biological theory, and with a social epistemology that facilitates the sharing of intentionality across minds. Gene-culture coevolution is responsible for the salience of such other-regarding human values as a taste for cooperation, fairness, and retribution, the capacity to empathize, and the ability to value such character virtues as honesty, hard work, piety, and loyalty.<br /><br />Gene-culture coevolution is the application of sociobiology, the general theory of the social organization of biological species, to humans--the only species that transmits culture in a manner that leads to quantitative growth across generations. This is a special case of niche construction, which applies to species that transform their natural environment so as to facilitate social interaction and collective behavior.<br /><br />The genome encodes information that is used both to construct a new organism and to endow it with instructions for transforming sensory inputs into decision outputs. Because learning is costly and time-consuming, efficient information transmission will ensure that the genome encode those aspects of the organism's environment that are constant, or that change only very slowly through time and space, as compared with an individual lifetime. By contrast, environmental conditions that vary rapidly can be dealt with by providing the organism with phenotypic plasticity in the form of the capacity to learn. For instance, suppose the environment provides an organism with the most nutrients where ambient temperature is highest. An organism may learn this by trial and error over many periods, or it can be hard-wired to seek the highest ambient temperature when feeding. By contrast, suppose the optimal feeding temperature varies over an individual's lifetime. Then there is no benefit to encoding this information in the individual's genome, but a flexible learning mechanism will enhance the individual's fitness. There is an intermediate case, however, that is efficiently handled neither by genetic encoding nor learning. When environmental conditions are positively but imperfectly correlated across generations, each generation acquires valuable information through learning that it cannot transmit genetically to the succeeding generation, because such information is not encoded in the germ line. In the context of such environments, there is a fitness benefit to the transmission of epigenetic information concerning the current state of the environment. Such epigenetic information is quite common, but achieves its highest and most flexible form in cultural transmission in humans and to a considerably lesser extent in other primates.<br /><br />The parallel between cultural and biological evolution goes back to Julian Huxley , Karl Popper , and William James.  The idea of treating culture as a form of epigenetic transmission was pioneered by Richard Dawkins, who coined the term \\"meme\\" in The Selfish Gene to represent an integral unit of information that could be transmitted phenotypically. There quickly followed several major contributions to a biological approach to culture, all based on the notion that culture, like genes, evolve through replication (intergenerational transmission), mutation, and selection. Cultural elements reproduce themselves from brain to brain and across time, mutate, and are subject to selection according to their effects on the fitness of their carriers. Moreover, there are strong interactions between genetic and epigenetic elements in human evolution, ranging from basic physiology (e.g., the transformation of the organs of speech with the evolution of language) to sophisticated social emotions, including empathy, shame, guilt, and revenge-seeking.<br /><br />Wilson's treatment of ethics and religion are cogent and masterful. He contrasts two modes of thinking about morality, transcendentalist and empiricist. While recognizing the transcendentalist yearnings in the breast of most humans, and while acknowledging that religious sentiments of the transcendental sort are the product of gene-culture coevolution, he argues that the evidence is strongly on the side of empiricists, who recognize the human significance of ethics, but root ethics in material processes that have an existence independent from that of a transcendental God or Reason. On these grounds he faults not only Kant, but Moore and Rawls as well. For instance, he argues that Moore's `Naturalistic Fallacy' is itself a fallacy. \\"If ought is not is, then what is it?\\" (p. 273) In other words, everything that is, is part of some material process, so the transition between ought and is is not cross-category but rather within-category. This does mean that everything that is, ought to be, but rather, we determine the ethical principles that are valid for humans by studying how humans create and transform the moral lives.<br /><br />The only drawback of this book is his treatment of the social sciences. Wilson is well-read in the various social sciences and his criticisms of sociology, anthropology, and economics are generally accurate, however harsh. His recommendation for reform is that they recognize gene-culture coevolution and reform their theories accordingly. However, he gives us no idea how to accomplish this.

The first is that there is a  characteristic human morality that is exhibited in almost all societies,  from the simplest hunter-gatherer society to the most complex high-tech  market society. The second is that one studies morality not by abstractly  theorizing on the basis of logic and intuition alone, has has been the  habit of philosophers, but by treating morality as a material force and  studying it scientifically as an evolutionary and structural  phenomenon.<br />The first paper, by Jessca Flack and Frans de Waal, argues  that some basic elements of human morality are prefigured in primate  behavior.<br />The second paper, by Chris Boehm, argues that the basis for  our morality of cooperation and punishment come from the evolutionary  history of humans in consciously egalitarian (though violent) foraging  groups.<br />The third paper, by Eliot Sober and David Sloan Wilson, argues  that human prosociality takes the form of evolutionary and psycholotical  altruism that developed through a process of group selection over the  history of hominid evolution.<br />The final paper, by Brian Skyrmes, studies  evolutionary game theory, which underlies the arguments of each of the  previous papers, contrasting this form of game theory from its classical  counterpart.<br />Perhaps I am biased, since I contributed two of the  commentaries, but I found the papers to be a fair reflection of the  authors' often extensive writings on the subject, and I found the  commentaries to be useful and at times extremely interesting in terms of  their suggestions for future research.<br />This book is accessible to the  general reader, while offering lots of interesting material for the  professional researcher.	2000-05-29

It is not for the layperson. The book is an extended exegesis on Price's equation---like variations and  themes. The exposition is a bit rough, but some of the formulations are  marvelous.<br />Price's equation is great for dealing with the interaction of  structured populations, but there are other important approaches, including  developing Markov processes and/or sets of differential equations to  capture the dynamics of interacting social groups.	2000-05-16

O. Wilson, Richard Dawkins, John Maynard Smith and others on one side, and Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Lewontin, and Science for the People on the other. Most of the authors material was gather for her 1983 Ph.D.  dissertation, but there is plenty of material from the mid to late 1990's  as well.<br />Despite the length and degree of detail of the book, I found it  difficult to skip even a page, so well is it written and so engaging is the  author. It is hard to believe that she could still inject new insights in  to the analysis 300 pages in to the book, but this she does, and repeatedly  so.<br />The author has deep respect for the anti-sociobiologists, but she is  clearly on the side of their critics. In this I believe she is correct.  While my personal history is closer to that of the opponents (I was a  Marxist and an anti-racist activist at the same time Gould, Lewontin, et  al. were) I never had the slightest sympathy for their critique of E. O.  Wilson (I read Sociobiology when it first came out and didn't even mind the  infamous last chapter, though I though it was wrong---and it is), and their  treatment of Maynard Smith, Dawkins, and more recently evolutionary  psychology, is to mind simply silly and ignorant---the opponents may be  great biologists, but they are third rate amateurs at understanding social  theory and human sociality, in my opinion.<br />I'm sure there are lessons to  be learned from this intellectual saga, but I must report that the greatest  pleasure for me was to see great minds battle it out in public. Of course,  behind the scenes scientists were slowly and patiently working out the real  issues, and we are measurable better informed now that when this battle  began in the mid-1970's. The sociobiologists and behavioral ecologists won  the scientific war, though the enemy is still sniping away around the  perimeter.	2000-04-30

He is also widely read in the arts and popular culture. He has a fertile imagination and a creative bent that makes reading his ideas a real  pleasure. This book is, as they say, &quot;a good read.&quot;<br />But is it  correct? Miller tries to explain the mystery of human intellect and  creativity. Why would a creature (us) who evolved under the most primitive  of material conditions, who lacked even sedentary agriculture until 10,000  years ago, have evolved the mental capacity for beauty, wit, rhythm, and  truth? His answer is: sexual (as opposed to survival) selection. In short  we are smart and talented because women preferred to mate with smart and  talented men.<br />There is a problem, however. There are two theories of  sexual selection: runaway selection (associated with Darwin and Ronald  Fisher), and the handicap principle (Zahavi). Most of Miller's arguments  require the former (although he formally disavows this early in the book),  while the latter is probably the only plausible model of sexual  selection.<br />For instance, the idea that we have large brains because women  prefer intelligent men, even if intelligence imposes a fitness cost on men,  is plausible only if intelligence is a signal of a superior fitness in some  other hidden area (e.g., a lower parasite load). But I cannot think of one  such area, nor does Miller supply one. Intelligence may have direct fitness  benefits for humans, but that is NOT sexual selection, but straightforward  selection for survivability.<br />In short, I think Miller is wrong, and I  know there is no quantitative evidence for his 'just-so story,' but I loved  the book anyway.	2000-04-24

From my point of view, the book leaves much to be desired.<br />I  do not have the expertise to comment on the author's neuroscientific  arguments. Whatever their value, his applications to economics and the  other social sciences are highly general and superficial, consisting of  quoting some authorities from the past and interspersing one or two current  references on a given topic.

The plusses of the book are (1) they show that rape is a sexual act directed at obtaining pleasure rather than being an expression of male  power; (2) they show that as predicted by evolutionary theory, males are  evolutionarily adapted to rape, whereas females are not. These are terribly  important facts, and they go against the accepted wisdom in contemporary  sociology and some brands of feminism; but the accepted wisdom has no  empirical basis whatever, in the authors opinion and mine as well.  The  minuses of the book will appear trivial to those who believe in the  accepted wisdom and are shattered by its demise. But they are important  nonetheless. Most important, TP view males as touting up the costs of  raping (pleasure, possible reproduction) against the costs (getting caught  and punished). If the benefits exceed the costs, the male rapes. This  ignores all forms of interpersonal interaction except the brute physical.  For instance, the 'cost' of causing harm to an innocent victim, the 'cost'  of seeing a victim helpless and miserable because of your actions, the  'cost' of having the self-image as a sexual predator, and the like, are  simply not part of their model of human motivation.  Yet there is  overwhelming evidence that people are not self-interested in the way depicted  by TP. Males who use TP's cost/benefit analysis are better described as  psychopaths or sociopaths rather than normal humans. This is because in the  course of our evolution, humans have picked up fundamental prosocial  traits. When these are absent in a person, the person is an abnormal,  pathological case.  In short, an alternative to TP's characterization of  rape is that rapists are males who have abnormal personalities (including  but not limited to psychopathy) the allow them to act out on urges that all  males have but in most are countermanded by basic human sympathies.  TP do  a disservice to evolutionary theory, which they use to portray humans as a  sorry lot of selfish brutes. The fact is that evolution produces morality  and beauty, sensitivity and love, just as much as rape, murder, and  indifference.onary theory, which they use to portray humans as a  sorry lot of selfish brutes.
