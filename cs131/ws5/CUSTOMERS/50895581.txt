I found this book to be the most helpful for Torts class. The book explains the history behind the subjects and then what the substantive law is. It lays everything out very logically and is organized in a way that makes sense as well. While it doesn't have any comprehensive case summaries, if you truly want to understand the law of torts, you can't go wrong with this book.	2002-11-28

She has money trouble, her car just got taken away by the repo man, and she's behind on her bills and rent. So, upon hearing that her cousin Vinnie's got an opening at his bail bonds company, she reluctantly goes there so she pull herself out this financial abyss. <br />And so Evanovich begins her hilarious Stephanie Plum series. The thing that differentiates this book from many others in the genre is that Stephanie is a normal person. She's not a sleuth or a PI. She's a bounty hunter trying to learn the trade and stumbles into much of the information she receives to help catch Joe Morelli, the rogue cop who she must bring back to justice.<br />Another plus is that Evanovich is a master at hiding the finale in this book. Once I finished the novel, I just closed it and said, &quot;WOW!&quot; It was totally unexpected.<br />All that being said, the book is extremely well written. Evanovich has a flair for description and the reader feels as if he/she is there with Stephanie, sniffing out the clues to catch Morelli. Another bonus are the hilarious minor characters, Lula and Jackie. They are a couple of prostitutes Stephanie meets. Their confidence and brashness is a nice contrast to Stephanie's timidity.<br />So, to conclude, if you haven't read this yet, you are truly missing out on one of the fresh new voices in the mystery genre.	2001-07-19

Like many of the other reviewers, I was wary of the fact that the book is written entirely as a series of inter-company e-mails. However, Beaumont pulls it off fantastically.<br />The key element to the humor is the duplicitous nature of the main characters. In the personal e-mails to each other, we see what they really think, and in the business e-mails, and to contrast, the business e-mails are all brown-nosing and have the forced quality of many official e-mails.<br />There also several running jokes, such as the agency president's e-mails getting diverted to the Finnish office, and the many amorous liaisons among the underlings.<br />What I found surprising that Beaumont was able to flesh out the characters so well. Every one of the characters has a unique voice and as the book progressed, I found myself cheering when something bad happened to Simon, the conniving creative director.<br />I whole-heartedly recommend this book to all.	2001-07-19

It might be the mechanic who cheated you, the professor who unfairly gave you a bad grade, etc. That being said, Blackburn is a book in which the main character actually acts upon these urges.<br />Jimmy Blackburn has been put down all his life. His parents abuse him, and he's looked at as a failure in life. So, when a cruel police officer harasses him outside a church, Blackburn, having had enough, kills him. This begins a crusade against unfairness and immorality in society. Blackburn begins a crusade against those who wrong others and him. <br />The story is horrifying and thought provoking at the same time. Blackburn rises against society's ills. However, as the book winds down, he is seen not as a public crusader, but as a serial killer. Are his actions wrong because society doesn't condone murder or is he providing a public service by disposing of some of the scum out there? I found myself asking this question after finishing this book.<br />Read this now. It is not an easy read, but you will be the better for it once you finish.	2001-07-19

He has gained a mass audience while still retaining his credibility as a &quot;serious&quot; author, worthy of critical consideration. That's pretty hard to do.<br />This book, the first of Roth's that I read, showed me his reputation was well earned. The satire was over-the-top, but Roth knew just when to pull back a little to avoid it from diving into Marx Brothers territory. The characterizations of Nixon and his administration are dead on. I loved how the story gradually became more and more absurd until reaching a crescendo at the end.<br />What impressed me even more is that Roth wrote this book before Nixon's ouster. Reading it with that knowledge, one has to feel kind of spooked that so many things in this book actually turned out to be true.<br />With all that, this book still manages to be a light and funny read. I would recommend it to all.	2001-06-21

The whole thing is great. <br />I found myself consistently laughing at some of the things Alford did in his investigations, such as gauging what happened when he asked the nude housecleaners to do things like bleach his tub or wash his windows from the outside. All in all, this is a very satisfying book for any fan of humor.	2001-04-18

It is very perverse and zany fun.<br />The book begins with the murder of a black house wroker by a member of a prominent English family in the city of Piemburg. Enter the police. There is Kommandant van Heerden, who wants nothing more than to be English, Konstabel Els, who is renowned as a killer of blacks, and Luitenant Veerkramp, who is one of the slimiest and wiliest characters in the Piemburg police force. A routine police investigation turns into an armed confrontation between the unwitting members of the Piemburg police force, while van Heerden is unwillingly seduced by the murderer he is investigating. These are just a few of the hijinks that ensue as the police's irrational actions keep making the situation worse.<br />This book is excellent because Sharpe is able to expose the irrationality of apartheid and the actions of the authorities to keep this practice going. After reading this book, there is little wonder in my mind why Sharpe was expelled from South Africa in the '70s.	2001-04-12
US	50895581	R26PK1JGGJSSSV	0385332815	965976317	Krippendorf's Tribe	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Excellent book	This book is one of the best I have read this year. If you can find it, I would highly recommend it.<br />As for the story, it centers around James Krippendorf. He is a professor who has squandered all of his grant money and is forced to invent the Shelmikedmu tribe. This is where all similarities between the book and movie end. In the book, James receives a lucrative offer from Exotica, an &quot;anthropological&quot; journal which is tantamount to a magazine filled with the nude pictures one would see in National Geographic. <br />Krippendorf, to get some photos of Shelmikedmu females, seduces and photographs a number of women whom he becomes familiar with, including a babysitter and one of his son's classmates' mother. Throughout the entire book, while he is carrying out these schemes, his unruly children are creating a maelstrom of destruction around the house. Eventually, the children turn wild and start to live in a treehouse and adopt the Shelmikedmu's &quot;customs&quot;. This leads to some interesting and hilarious complications.<br />The best part of this book by far is Krippendorf. The way he acts is reminiscent of Ignatius Reilly in &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; in that he sees nothing wrong with his behavior and nonchalantly accepts his childrens' overly unruly behavior. For example, when one of his sons shoots the neighbors' dog with a BB gun, instead of being mad, Krippendorf simply promises him a new gun if his son keeps quiet about it. <br />This book is definitely not for kids, due to its adult subject matter. Like a previous reviewer, I also find it curious that Disney would make a movie out of it.	2001-04-12

There is an Internet site that has the first 4 chapters online, so I read a couple of the chapters and could not stop laughing. So I bought the book. Then I read the rest. This book is not bad by any means, but it is hampered by Weisbecker's inside jokes and heavy handed humor. A little subtlety really does go a long way, but I don't think Weisbecker knows that. The last few chapters read like one of Hunter S. Thompson's articles and that's not necessarily a complement. The story just takes huge leaps in logic that are hard to reconcile. I would recommend this book to people who are sci-fi fans or love Monty Python, but the rest of you may want to check it out before buying.	2001-04-03

It will consume you. You will feel compelled to read this and be oblivious to all other things around you.<br />That being said, this book is the funniest I have ever read, and I read an average of 2 books a week. Payne is a master of comedy. This book is a barrage of comic situations written as young Nick Twisp's diary. <br />After a visit to Ukiah, CA, where Nick meets the ravishing Sheeni Saunders, he has to be reunited withher. So, he starts plotting and manipulating those around him. This involves getting is dad fired and finding him a job in Ukiah. Then, he must leave his mother and her series of tyrannical boyfriends. All the while, Sheeni is carrying on with Trent, a boy one year older than she. Oblivious to their relationship, Nick tries eveyrthing to get back with Sheeni. All of this description is just scratching the surface of this masterpiece.<br />Don't be fooled by the length. This book is a very quick read.

This book was a triumphant return to the style of writing and humor that made Pest Control such a great book. The character development is excellent. At the beginning of the novel, Dan Steele, the main character is a prototypical yuppie executive whose thirst for material possessions exceeds all other desires in his life. By the end, he cares about his fellow man and not as much about how many toys he can amass. The aspect of the novel that really shines, though, is how Fitzhugh portrays the residents of the Care Center. While most authors might stereotype the elderly as cranky old codgers, Fitzhugh portrays them as the people who society forgot and who are desperately trying to cling to the Care Center, the last meaningful thing in their lives. While the ending seems kind of rushed, it is satisfying. This novel is a return to the style of Pest Control, and is all the better for it.	2001-04-01

It didn't appear to have any of the flaws that Beatty's debut had. The characters appeared to be more fleshed out, and the story more realistic. How wrong I was.<br />The main problem with this book was that it meandered too much. There is too much in here about the characters' ordinary lives and not enough action. This book never seemed to be have any sense of pacing or direction anywhere, and when the plot did advance, the whole thing seemed kind of forced. As a result, this book reads like a series of vignettes, rather than a unified novel. Also, Beatty's insistence of mixing low and high culture is irritating. One moment, the characters will be talking in ghetto slang, and the next minute, one of them is talking about his love of 1940's French movies. It just kills the mood that Beatty is trying to create.<br />Beatty obviously has great promise, but he has again failed to live up to it. I cannot recommend this book.	2001-04-01

The level of detail that Porter provides about the smuggling operations is excellent. He devotes a good portion of the book to discussion of this and that's the main reason why this book is so interesting. On the other hand, George Jung's story is a typical story of the drug dealer who doesn't know when to stop. I did think that discussing Jung's childhood did not really help the book in any way. It simply gave us background that really was not required to understand the rest of his life. Porter might have been better served by focusing less on Jung and more on the smuggling. Overall, however, I would recommend this book.	2001-03-24

Everyone businessman I know has either read it or heard of it. So, I decided that I should check it out.<br />This book is an account of Michael Lewis' time at Salomon Smith Barney in the mid 80s, at the height of the junk bond craze. He perfectly describes the atmosphere of competitiveness and the vast rewards everyone was reaping as a result of the boom.<br />What came as a surprise to me is that Lewis describes the mortgage bond market, an obtuse and vague instrument, very clearly and in a way most non-business people could also understand. This explanation also serves to show why these junk bonds ultimately collapsed.<br />Then, of course, are his hilarious descriptions of his orientation, his bosses and coworkers. To read about these outlandish characters is worth the price of the book alone.<br />So, to close, this book is a classic for a reason. It is informative and well written, but manages to be hilarious at the same time, a feat few authors can achieve. Read this book at all costs.	2001-03-08

The first few chapters were great. After that, the trouble began. In the first few chapters, there were small elements of fantasy that caught the reader off-guard. However, after that, Beatty went totally overboard with the fantasy element of the story. It turned from a charming story about a young black man's struggles while growing up into a combination Tom Robbins novel-sermon about what is wrong with society.

While Keteyian and Co. certainly don't pull any punches, it might have been nice to see some of the positive things in the NBA discussed.

I place this book and its predecessor in the same class as John Kennedy Toole's Confederavy of Dunces. The pacing is manic and the action nonstop. Just when you think that it can't get any zanier, Payne pulls another trick out of his hat. <br />This, and Youth In Revolt, are the funniest books I've read in my 23 years on this planet.	2001-02-27

Hell, having an affair with your dad is as messed up as it gets. The way Harrison writes is very annoying and distracted me from the main point. Apparently, she thinks describing everything around her constitutes a plot. I read a couple of chapters and couldn't go on.	2001-02-27

Easily accessible and full of quips and stories. In the book, Williams tells many humorous tales of NBA hi-jinks. However, he contrasts these by telling stories of the racism and prejudice he encountered as a young child in South Carolina. The book thus achieves a good balance between humor and poignancy. I would recommend this to everyone, not just sports fans.	2001-02-27

The story is engaging and the characters are likable. The plot also moves along nicely and doesn't present us with anything too incredulous. A nice, light read which everyone can enjoy.	2001-02-27

This book presents the information in a straightforward and sometimes irreverent manner. The most appealing feature about this book was that it was very easy to follow. Each section and its strategies are presented in a very visual way, which encourages learning. For example, in the games section, it has you solve a game first and then goes step by step and shows how to solve it, how to put all the clues together, etc. This book is much easier than some other books I also used, notably ARCO's book. The one thing I thought that could have been done better was the games section in the diagnostic tests at the end of the book. They were much easier than the games in the TriplePrep books. But besides that, this is the best book that's out there.	2001-02-08

It's filled with witty anecdotes and really goes behind the scenes in a way few other sports books do. Shropshire shows how listless Whitey Herzog became while managing the team. The way he writes, you almost feel like you're there with Shropshire, getting drunk before having to write about another Rangers loss. I would recommend this to all people, not just sports fans.	2001-01-09

It is quite obvious from simply observing the world that there are people striving for uniqueness. However, that aside, the book is written in an organized way and Snyder supports his theories with ample experimental evidence.	2000-10-08

However, the story is quite boring and none of the characters are particularly likable. It reads more like a collection of bad short stories rather than a coherent, unified novel. Pass on this one.	2000-10-03

The characters are stereotypical and thoroughly  unlikable. The story also becomes fairly outlandish  after the first few  chapters. Prose doesn't take the time to establish a plausible story and  that is what ultimately leads to this book's downfall.	2000-09-02

The main characters in this book are actually fleshed out characters and not stereotyped uber-geeks. <br />Some of the other reviewers  said that the book glosses over the technical aspects of computers too  much. I disagree. I don't think Bronson dumbed down the computer  explanations as much as summarized them in normal language. Having a lot of  technical info in this book would detract from the main thing, which is the  story.<br />All in all, Bronson has written a fine book. The book has lots of  twists and turns and is a page turned until the end.	2000-06-11

Stauth takes you inside the first Dream Team. His style of writing makes you feel like you were right next to Jordan and Pippen in 1992. He takes  the reader on a behind the scenes journey and shows the conflicts and other  problems the Dream Team faced before and during their gold medal run.	2000-06-02

While Slim does go into the specifics of how he was pimping, this is done to show what distasteful work it was and why he left  that life. That being said, this is one of the best books I have ever read.  It is fast paced and the way Iceberg writes, you almost feel as if you are  there, with him on the corner, in the bar. I finished this in 2 days, and  I'm a pretty slow reader, so that should tell you something.	2000-05-29

This book is not a typical coming-of-age story. Instead of growing into adult responsibilities, Dave Eggers has them thrown at him when he is forced to become his brother Toph's guardian. While I expected the book to  primarily cover their relationship, I found the anecdotes about Eggers'  struggles at Might magazine and his search for his parents' ashes  interesting. This book got a lot of critical praise and deservedly so.	2000-05-29

It wasn't too long ago that I was feeling the same anxieties as Adrian. Sue Townsend inject humor into teen angst without  trivializing the experience. I found myself laughing constantly because he  was doing stuff that I remember myself doing. A definite must-read.	2000-04-12

The book has Forrest getting into even more outlandish (and less wishy-washy) situations. For example, he spends 4  years in stranded in the jungles of New Guinea and learns chess from a  Yale-educated tribal leader named Big Sam. You have to read it to believe  it.	2000-04-12

While this is a worthwhile read, I would suggest reading &quot;Rants&quot; first. In this book, he uses a lot of the same jokes in  different rants and they're just not as funny as the ones from the previous  book.	1999-12-31

Unlike other comedy performers, Rock's act holds up very well in paper form. <br />The organization of the book is also excellent and his use of larger type to draw attention to certain words in the bits actually works pretty well. As I said earlier, a lot of the material here is from his concert films, but it is interspersed with new and fresh bits.<br />I personally liked the fact that a lot of material from his stand up act is here in print. It allows me to read this wherever I go. <br />So, if you're Rock fan, (or even if you aren't) go get this one.	1999-12-31
US	50895581	R2ZPBFEPDTN608	038547802X	359819030	The Rants	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Funny stuff	Many people complain that Dennis Miller's jokes go over most people's heads. Well, for those of us who can pick up on his often obscure references, this book is a treat. <br />In today's comedy environment, where scatalogical humor and inane observational humor is the norm, Miller is a beacon of light in a fog of mediocrity. He knows just when to drop one of those patented analogies he is so well known. Of course, the analogies would be irrelevant if the monologues themselves weren't sharp and satiric looks at society today.<br />So, I say go read this book. It's funnier than watching a Himalayan mountain guide getting gored by a yak.	1999-12-24

This was not. <br />There was a fundamental problem with this book. I found it hard to care about any of the characters. I thought the evil businessman was too over the top, and the environmental activist to be a whiny and self-loathing wimp. For everyone's info, I could not finish the book.<br />The story itself was also pretty bad. There was no sense of pacing. There would be pages upon pages in which the main character is describing the woes of his childhood, and then suddenly he goes to collect signatures for a petition. It really hurt the continuity, and as a result, the readability of this book. <br />I cannot recommend this book. If you want to read something by Fitzhugh, go read Pest Control.	1999-12-22

He is like a funnier version of Elmore Leonard.	1999-12-14
