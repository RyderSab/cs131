I'd been hearing about this book from almost everyone I knew, so I got it out of the library (after a 1 month wait, may I add).  I opened it last night, expecting to read a few chapters and then to go to bed.  Well, luckily I didn't have work today...I was up all night reading until my eyes couldn't stay open anymore.<br />The central questions of the book revolve around spirituality and the nature of Christian tradition and faith.  It throws into question the nature of the Holy Grail, and the version of history that the Catholic Church would have us believe.  Granted, these are theories that have been put forth by many scholars, and Brown is merely drawing upon their work, but he weaves fact and fiction together into a rich tapestry.<br />However, the book is so much more.  Brown is one of the few authors who can change viewpoint well.  His characters are well written, the plot is paced well, and the two twists at the end surprising.  The meat of the book will give you something to think about...well, unless you're a sheep and prefer to follow blindly rather than think for yourself.<br />I strongly recommend the book.	2004-01-07

With two keys out of the way, Zoe must find the 3rd key or the daughter's souls will be lost forever.  A single mom who's opening her own business (and wouldn't I love to go there?) and fighting her attraction to the delectable Bradley Vane, she's under a ton of pressure.  Kane gets nastier in the third installment.<br />I just have to say that I absolutely fell into the story...I felt like I was watching a movie rather than reading a book.

And JK Rowlings did the right thing by making him a slightly snotty teenager who wants to rebel against authority.  Perhaps my view is colored by the fact that I'm a teacher, but I have met few teens who don't challenge authority, and who react badly to having their rose colored glasses come off.<br />At the same time, the darkening of the series means that parents should pre-read the book to make sure it's appropriate for younger readers.  I had a ton of third graders eagerly awaiting this book and not all of them were mature enough to handle it.  If your student is above 5/6th grade, no worries.<br />The book furthers the plot line, and takes some of the polish off the wizarding world.  If there is an issue I have with the first couple books, it's how perfect everything is (for the most part) is in the wizarding world.  Sure they've had their problems, but with Dumbledore and the Ministry standing guard, nothing too horrific could happen again.  In this book we see Dumbledore, harry's parents, and the ministry as more fallible, potentially corruptible entities.  We also see Snape in a more sympathetic light, making his character grow as well.<br />Overall, kudos to ms rowlings...I just hope it isn't another 3 years before book 6	2003-12-18

His first book, Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot, was hysterical and skewered the idiotic talk show host with a rapier wit.  I was fortunate enough to see him live at Joe's Pub in NYC last year (02) on Election Night, and he's just as funny and articulate in person.  So I had high expectations for this book.<br />For the most part they were met.  Franken makes many strong arguements against the mythos that the press is biased towards liberals.  Using examples from the election of '00 and more recent political events, Franken makes a strong case for a conservative bias in the media.<br />There were however, several pieces, the comic strip chapter among them that were unnecessary, unfunny, and that took away from the rest of the book.<br />Overall, however, I'd still reccomend it.	2003-12-18

I had been so dissapointed by the last few Valdemar books that I couldn't go out and pay 22 dollars for it.  But, I was quite pleased to see it out as a paperback and was more than willing to drop 8 on it.<br />My criticisms first: <br />Why oh why did Misty feel the need to write her alter ego, herald chronicler Myste into the story and more to the point, why did she have to have Myste and Alberich on the verge of a thing?  Why?  Why?  Why?<br />I think there's an inconsistency in the way that the king dies.  In the third arrows book, I thought it was revealed that Orthallen had arranged for Sendar to be assassinated during the Tedrel Wars, but in this book, Sendar makes a suicide rush during a crucial point in a battle knowing full well he isn't coming back alive.  <br />OK..now onto the praise<br />1. Misty has said for years that she's wanted to write Alberich's back story, and had gone as far as to write &quot;Stealing Silver&quot; the short story published in &quot;Sword of Ice and other stories of Valdemar&quot;.  But I'm glad she waited...for awhile it felt like she was getting tired of writing Valdemar...burnt out on the same subject matter/world she's been writing in for 20 years.  So she waited...and the book came out much better than it would have had she written it 5 years ago.  She's having a good time with it and you can tell.<br />2. The development of Selenay from Princess to Queen is breathtaking.  There are several scenes towards the end where she is coming into her own where I found myself tearing up.<br />3. The backstory for Jadus and Talamir is welcome.  We met Jadus in the arrows books, and knew him as an older man in the twilight of his years.  In Honor's Exile we see him in his prime, and it feels like a honest portrayal.  As for Talamir, his presence is felt in the arrows books, but we never get a good sense of who he was or why he didn't stop the chain of events that allowed Selenay married to her first husband and for Elspeth to end up the way she originally did.  We see Talamir in his prime and experience the events that began to change him.  I imagine this will also be key in the sequel.<br />3. Kantor is a cool and different Companion from the ones we've seen before.  More of a warrior, less of an idealist...it's a good change.<br />Overall, while this is not the last herald mage (which was a life altering series), it's a great addition to the cannon.  Based on the strength of this novel, I'd even be willing to shell out the full price of the sequel in hardcover.	2003-12-18

When I realized that Nora Roberts was &quot;co-writing&quot; a book with her own alter-ego JD Robb, I began to bounce up and down like a child on christmas morning.  I have been a Nora Roberts fan since I was around 17 or 18 (she being one of the only romance writers I can enjoy) and have been devouring her work since.  I got hooked on her JD Robb stuff about 5 years ago, and now whine my way through the 6 month gap between books.  So, you can imagine my anticipation for this book.<br />First of all, I bought it in hardcover, which is a rare purchase for me.  With the exception of Nora Novels, I rarely buy hardcover...too much money.  And I read it in one night...couldn't put it down.<br />It starts out as a Nora Novel, with the events happenning in 2003.  Then it flashes over 50 years forward and Eve Dallas (one of the best characters ever) becomes entangled in a case involving the descendants of the first part of the novel.<br />What a great melding of her two styles, while staying true to both aspects of herself.	2003-12-18

Then, of course, came the debate of who really wrote it...and whether that person was Stephen King.  We found out that he did not.  However, the author does mimic the style of King to a large degree.  While the book does have some really slow moments, for the most part it's a decently intriguing story.  Ellen is the young wife of a Seattle oil baron...and her story is full of non-vanilla sex (not the prudish among us) disappearing people and a possessed house.	2003-05-13

She is at times funny and serious, and capable of explaining history in academic terms that aren't so esoteric as to be incomprehensible to the non-historian while giving a fresh spin on a well documented time period.<br />In Parlor Politics, Allgor documents the vital role that women played in the creation of a society during (arguably) the most fragile period in our history.  One wrong move and the whole deomcracy concept could've gone out the window.  Women were able to step in and do things that men couldn't, and under the guise of furthering their family became real movers and shakers in the early washington scene.  Allgor documents the time of Jefferson through the Jackson presidency and does so with a style that is often missing in academic texts.  It is easy to see why this book is quickly becoming an influential work in the history of Washington and the construction of america.<br />If you enjoy this book, you may want to also read &quot;good wives&quot; by laurel thatcher ulrich...more dry, but also interesting.	2002-04-03

First I need to defend the fact that I'm 23 and writing this review.  I just want to point out that tamora pierce was around when I was a tween and a teen.  Her books are so well written, I've just kept buying them.<br />I would first like to commend pierce on writing a much longer book than usual.  Her thanks in the authors note go out to JK Rowlings (and if you're unfamiliar with Rowlings I must ask if you've been living in a cave) who wrote and succeeded with a 700+ page book for kids.  I have long thought that childrens (well, tween and teen books) were much too short.  We need to give kids the credit due them and realize that they can sit down and read these longer books.<br />Squire is the third book in the protector of the small series.  Pierces protagonist is Kel (or Keladry) the first non-magic aided girl to want to become a knight of tortall (the only other being Alanna of Treborn--see her 4 book series for more info) and the struggles she faces because of it.  Pierce deftly handles Kel's early teen years and honestly and frankly deals with Kel having a crush and then moving into kissing boys.  She has Kel have a frank conversation about sex with her mother which I commend Pierce for again.<br />There have been criticisms of the almost triangle in this book.  I liked it...Kel is a normal girl.  She likes one boy but can't help but notice and have a crush on another...ladies don't you remember being 12-15?  I do...and it still occasionally happens...I'm in a relationship, not blind.<br />Pierce writes her characters very well.  They are well developed, (although cleon could be more developed and I hope he will be in the next book) and have personalities that are both believable and likable.  I have read many adult writers who could not accomplish this, a major reason why I will continue to dart into the young readers section at my local bookstore and buy the new books as they arrive.	2001-09-01

It blasts the mythos surrounding the ideal of the dad as ultimate authority, the happy stay at home mom, and the 2.5 children.  Once you read the book you start to question if there ever was a norm...and that's what we need to tell Washington.

I went around quoting her for weeks on end (and still do).  And I was able to pull out of my thesis/senior slump.<br />Why?  Douglas portrays and relates the experiences of the american woman and her relationship (at times comfy, most often at odds) with the media.  Relating her own experiences of seeing stay at home moms on tv and watching her mom go to work are only the beginning.  She disects Disney with a rapier wit and keen vision.  She points out that I dream of jeannie was not fluff, but subversive.  She tells us &quot;why the shirelles matter&quot;.<br />Her book is mostly free of academese, and if you are neither a historian, nor a women's studies major you can easily understand what she's saying, which is often not the case.  She's fun to read and she's brillant.  Even if you're not of the baby boom generation (as I am not) or even if you're not a woman, you NEED to read this book.

It was not my introduction to Misty (that would be The Black Gryphon, a must read) but instead a nice addition to Valdemar.  And considering that it's the first book in the trilogy that starts the era that the majority of her valdemar novels have taken place in, it's a solid foundation.<br />Criticisms...  A somewhat plain girl, abused by a relative, falls in love with an ugly man, is a governess (sort of)...felt very familiar to me.<br />Praise...Misty is a favorite author of mine, and her valdemar series is some of her best work.  Arrows is a book where the woman is not the sexual plaything of others (although there is *gasp* sex--non graphic in the book...wow, who in the world has ever done THAT???) is not brainless and is not background which are major criticsms of other fantasy authors.  Talia is a girl who comes into her own.  I would much rather my sisters and eventually daughters read about girls like her rather model themselves after Britney Spears (who although she may claim to \\"own\\" her sexuality, is told how to dress and what to sing by middle aged men...).<br />Talia has a power that is unlike anything seen in Valdemar or in Misty novels before.  She is a powerful empath.  What I find most interesting is that Misty examines the moral dilemmas inherent in having a very high political position (queens own) and having a power that could allow you to \\"read\\" what others are thinking and perhaps even to \\"nudge\\" them into your way of thinking.  What are the limits?  What are the proper uses...theres no guidelines for this.<br />Talia's friendships and her gradual easing of fear towards men is also done very well.  An abused girl does not trust men..this is fact.  The way Misty handles it is quite well.  Her friendships with a lesbian couple is also done quite well.  Their sexuality is not dwelt upone, but neither is it hidden.  10% of the real world is gay...deal with it.  <br />All in all, a good example of her work.	2001-09-01

As a historian utlizing the book for research in several projects, including a thesis I found her research skills to be in accordance with the type of research she is doing (ie when you're talking about a very private thing such as menstruation, there are very few sources other than diaries if you're trying to get individual experiences...this is considered good research within the profession) her documentation useful, and some of her views very interesting.  As a student teacher, when I am trying to add in gender to an otherwise male centered class, Brumberg is a source I often cite and advise my students to read, because although I'm reviewing it as a historian, from a general viewpoint you don't need the background of a historian to like the book.  It is a easy and often amusing read.  Anyone interested in how women became so obsessed with our bodies to the point of obsession, or even if you're just interested in how we used to handle such issues such as menstruation and loss of virginity this is a great read.  Highly reccomended.	2000-09-30

Her main sources are the saturday evening post when discussing the middle class women who were urged into the workforce and true story when discussing the working class women.  She presents an  unconvincing argument.  Unconvincing?  Her sources were mismatched...one  being a weekly magazine aimed at all genders, the other a monthly aimed  only at women.  We really have no way of knowing that true story was only  aimed at working class women any more than we know that only lower class  individuals watch Jerry Springer.  Her samples were completely uneven, her  sources from the saturday evening post vastly outnumbering those from true  story.  She completely ignores women of color.  However, having said that,  the book is not a &quot;bad book&quot;.  As a historian in training I have  often had to limit myself more than I would like, so perhaps that explains  the complete lack of a discussion on race and ethnicity.  The first chapter  clearly presents a view of the various government organizations that were  created to organize and mobilize the propaganda machine, and that alone is  worth the price of the book.  Her analysis of her sources is decent as  well...especially that of true story.  The various story synopsis that she  presents are amusing, and her conclusions are worth a look.  I would not  reccomend it as the only source to read on ww2 propaganda, but is a good  addition to the scholarship on the subject.  And for the layman, don't  worry, it's very readable..she does not spout off jargon like other  authors.  Good for high school and above.	2000-04-12

By telling her story thematically (one chapter devoted to her and her sisters, one devoted to her daughter and Abigail jrs fight with breast cancer) we meet a new Abigail...one who is not weighed down by  proto-feminist thought, nor is she trying to dominate the home.  Abigail  was an unusual woman in a few ways, but keep in mind that she kept a family  togehter by herself for the many years when John Adams was in Philadephia  or England or France.  She acted within social norms as a &quot;deputy  husband&quot; (to use the language of the times).  Although at times I  question if Gelles isn't slightly underestimating the second first lady of  the US...she presents a new counterpoint to the large body of Abigail Adams  scholarship out there.  For those scholars of Abigail Adams, her first  chapter basically presents in a historiographical manner the various types  of Abigail scholarship out there, offering a critique of many of the  well-known authors.  It is a bit dry at times, but is not at all painful to  read.	2000-04-12

Drawing on many contemporary sources, such as the writings of Christine De Pizan and those letters atributed to Joan, the author backs up her arguments.  There are also appendices which include sources in French  for those scholars who prefer to check their own translations against the  authors.  It's a great book for historians, theologians, and others.  It is  slightly advanced, but should not pose a problem for college students and  above.  Overall, a great read and a great aid for Joan-related research.	2000-04-11

Abelson spends a good amount of time (the first five chapters, in fact) focusing on the development of the department store and  setting up the class dichotomy between the shop girls and the shoppers.   She then spends the last two discussing the various ways shoplifting was  diagnosed (such as by the creation of kleptomania).  My issues with the  book, however, were that Abelson never really discusses the issue of race  (EVER), and also does not mention ethnicity.  She also makes some very good  arguements, such as when discussing the class dichotomy, but I feel that  she could have gone further than she did with her arguements.  However, I  found it to be a useful and interesting read.	2000-03-15

While criticizing the control aspects of advertising and  consumerism, they play into a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; mindset that  the same advertising they're criticizing helped to create.  A good read  overall, but remember to read it, as all things, critically	2000-01-30

It's books like this that persist in the ruination of history for many a student.  If this book were more widely  circulated, the need for sleeping pills would be drastically reduced.  I  have no idea how the author could take something this interesting and make  it so boring that I would literally fall asleep reading it.	1999-12-23

However, having said that, I found the book a  thoroughly enjoyable read...overdramaticized, yes, but we can forgive it  when we consider the original date of publication.  However, it is the  story behind the story that is most interesting.  What Ramona truly is....a  middle class white woman's perception of what it might be like to be an  Indian.  Jackson was an abolitionist turned author in the 1830's.  This is  her most recognized and extensive work.  So the next time you read it, if  you read between the lines, you will see HER innate prejudices and  assumptions.  But,like I said, I enjoyed it immensely and reccomend it as a  fun read...but don't take it too literally...it is after all, fiction	1999-12-23

It served as a central textbook for a medieval history class at my school and I found it acessible, enjoyable and orderly.  At times approached chronologically,  other times thematically, I found it to be a useful and insightful tool.	1999-12-23

I'm not sure what was hated more...the fact that the author never ONCE cited her research or that she attempted to give her subject a personality without any basis in fact. If you want to know what life was like as a peasant there is a future professor, I would have severe doubts about using this in any course except perhaps historiography. If anyone had turned this book in as a senior thesis, no professor of mine would have accepted it; they would have ripped it to shreds for the lack of citing.	1999-12-23

As a 21 year old cynic, I couldn't believe my friends when they started babbling on about some childrens book.  Then I heard all the hype about the Potter books taking over the NY Bestsellers List.  I HAD to pick up the first one...the next day I ran out to pick up the other two.  They're  clever, witty, and fun...I don't care about the &quot;childrens book&quot;  category...I bought it for everyone on my list...if you haven't read it by  now...what are you waiting for?	1999-12-23

Although given quite a  bit of literary license, she portrays witches as having real lives and  loves, and some of the problems that can come with being both a woman and a  witch.  Not to say that your everyday wiccan can do the types of tricks the  donovans pull off, but we are men and women who try to balance a normal  life with a belief in the goddess.  For those who enjoyed it, you may also  like Ceremony in Death by Roberts writing as JD Robb	1999-12-06

Silvers books have a great setup...the format is clear, the excercises make sense, and she  doesn't tell you &quot;this is the way it is&quot;, she makes you think  about how you feel and what you think of what she's presenting.  It makes  an incredible reference guide as well.  I picked it up for the first time 6  years ago, and i still check back for reference today.  Blessed Be!	1999-11-22

As a practicing witch for approximately six years, I have gotten to the point where I skim most wiccan texts, searching for useful info, and generally never reading them cover to cover anymore.  However, I found this a fresh new take on our old religion and read it cover to cover twice.  You  will find it written with a sense of humor, and many points of view and  traditions are represented within its pages.  I've reccomended it to  others, and I now reccomend it to you. :)      Blessed Be!	1999-07-12
