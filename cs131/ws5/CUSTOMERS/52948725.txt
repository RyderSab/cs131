I am not a professional musicologist, just a passionate amateur. I read a lot of musical biography and such, so I was pleasantly surprised to see just how much I learned from this book. It is a real joy to read, the sort of book one doesn't want to end. In my view, it is generally balanced and fair (though the chapters on Wagner and R. Strauss come close to assassination at times). Rather like Edward Gibbon, Steen lives out his sex life in his footnotes, which are often hilarious. The book is elaborately, even tediously, documented; but the  source notes are in the back, so as not to distract from the text notes. This is not a book on music; it is a book on composers: biography not musicology. (As Steen explains in a humorous introduction, music is about cellos, biography about fellows.)<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and recommend it highly. At the risk of sounding petty, I wish that so distinguished publisher as Oxford could have employed an editor to rid this otherwise fine work of numerous grammatical errors. But put down your red pen for a while and just have a good time with Steen's exploration of Western music.	2005-06-15

Stewart Spencer deserves high praise for his lucid translation.<br /><br />What this book most emphatically is NOT is a biography. Rather, it is a set of semi-philosophical musings on the themes of Wagner's music dramas. There is NO narrative, and readers ignorant of the track of Wagner's career will be lost. Koehler is hung-up on Wagner's relation with his step-father and his sisters. Moreover, in this account Cosima is an ogre fresh from the pages of the Brothers Grimm at their nastiest. Koehler's Wagner is glad to die at age 69 just to get away from her. This Wagner is also a Freudian's wet dream, with speculations that range from the interesting to the absurd.<br /><br />It is NOT a good first--or even second--book on Wagner. For biography try Ronald Taylor; for philosophy read Bryan Magee's exceptionally fine \\"Wagner and Philosophy\\" (American title: \\"The Tristan Chord\\").<br /><br />What this book IS is that it's much better than some of the crap Koehler has previously published. (For a book-length pathology of \\"post hoc ergo propter hoc\\" give his \\"Wagner's Hitler\\" a perusal. His logical fallacies will have you rolling with laughter out of your chair.) I am glad I read this book, difficult as it was. I learned a lot--or at least was exposed to some thought-provoking ideas.<br /><br />In sum, I'd recommend this book only to die-hard Wagnerians fairly well steeped in the literature already.	2005-05-11

Virtually every other sentence begins with a qualifier like \\"perhaps.\\" While I was reading this book I was dazzled by Prof. G's hand-is-quicker-than-the-eye dexterity. After finishing it, though, I realized that I'd actually learned very little.<br /><br />As an interesting scholarly speculation, this book is of some importance to readers of WS. Certainly it is not suitable as a first biography for novices. It's a pretty easy read; do it for fun, not profit.	2005-04-18

I checked it out of the public library and couldn't finish it in two weeks, so I purchased it from Amazon. I'm glad I did, for I believe I'll read this one again. Real historians can comment on Read's reliability; this amateur says that it's a well crafted piece of prose. Of course there's much that isn't here--consult Kershaw's variable two-volume biography of Hitler for that--but the focus on Goring and Goebbels is well handled. I give this one an A.	2005-03-06

I am usually a great reader of historical fiction, especially the kind packed with tid-bits of interesting information. Early reviews convinced me that &quot;Quicksilver&quot; would be just right for me. Pundits predicted a mega-hit. Wow, were they ever wrong! Words fail to express just how bad this book is. It's all setting, all background, overfull of detail. There is NO, repeat NO, plot, merely incident. And worst of all are the characters, which are as flat as the pages (and pages and pages) they're described on. Rare for me, I got about half way through and quit. I had been forcing myself to get on, hoping the book would somehow improve. It never did. I gave my copy to the public library. I'm sure you'll find several of them, similarly bestowed, in your town.

Horwitz's biting sense of humor is every bit in evidence here as in &quot;Confederates in the Attic,&quot; only the landscape is much larger.

The old one had a distinguished roster of editors and was pleasant to hold and read. In the latter category this new edition is a noble successor: clear type, full names of characters (no more \\"1 Serv.\\"), and notes indicated by line numbers. This new edition fails however in its skimpy (9 pages!) of introductory matter and a masthead of editors who are fairly obscure. Still, I would award the plume to this volume for the first-time reader who wants a complete Shakespeare. The pleasant appearance that I mentioned above is important--we want a volume easy to handle and read. The editing is conservative and non-controversial (no more of the Oxford/Norton kinky titles--\\"The First Part of the Contention,\\" sheesh--that's Henry VI, Part 2 to us plebians). And it's not as bulky as the power-lifter's Riverside and other editions. To sum up: if you have in your family or acquaintance a budding Shakespearean, this is still the one to buy. Seeing this book in the shop was like greeting an old friend. I look forward to hundreds of wonderful hours with it.	2002-10-23

This promising and potentially important historical study is all but ruined by the author's inability to control his subject matter. There's no denying that Hennessy knows his stuff. What he *doesn't* know is how to write. In a phrase, this book is a mess. It rambles, wanders, and meanders through fifty years of history and politics. For most readers (certainly this one) the result is a series of anecdotes. I should add that an American edition should have included a glossary of political terms and abbreviations. All in all, a disappointing piece of work that promised so much.	2002-08-16

I enjoy learning about Russian history--such a fascinating country! But after several attempts, I put this book back on the shelf, largely unread. It's a good book, I suppose. Certainly the author seems to know his subject inside and out. But for the ordinary reader of history, it demands too much. I agree with earlier reviewers that the narrative is unfocused, with too many untranslated words and phrases. More to the point (or my point) is the absence of personalities here. This is a political history, with little or no discussion of the flesh and blood people involved. So, I'd conclude that if you're a serious student of Russian history who wants a well thought out and serious analysis of Russian history, this book is for you. The rest of us might better appreciate lighter fare such as Lincoln's &quot;The Romanovs.&quot; Certainly I did.	2002-07-22

Certainly the fault is not in the story, which is of abiding interest. But Beevor just failed to ignite in me the excitement that these events merit. Inevitably I compared it to John Toland's &quot;The Last 100 Days,&quot; which treats the same period in a much more lively way (though out of date in its research). Perhaps it's the division of my interest among too many characters, some of whom (the Russians primarily) are not portrayed very vividly. Maybe it's just too many battles and not enough human interest. But as I said, mine seems to be the minority view.	2002-07-16

The three stories run simultaneously and center on the conflict between moral virtue and political action. It's a worthy theme. I'm not entirely sure, however, how well Pears brings it all off. The ending seems to lack thematic closure. Or perhaps I just missed something. This isn't a book for plot or character--the narrator is very distanced from his material, lending a chilly tone.

Magee is simply wonderful in his common-sense explanations of complex philosophical problems and their applications to Wagner's works.

Despite the trashy title, this is a good book, solid in its research and well-grounded in its conclusions. Diana wasn't the \\"People's Princess\\" that the Prime Minister called her at her death. She was a very sick woman who, in her selfishness, did great harm to a thousand-year institution of the monarchy. Seward is balanced and honest in her appraisals of the public strengths and private weaknesses of the late Princess of Wales. It's sad reading: first because her own story is one of deliberate self-destruction; then because of the harm she did her husband and the family she married into. In Seward's view the Queen was the best of the Royals to her, generous to a fault. Diana's failure (unlike that, say, of Princess Margaret or Jackie Kennedy Onassis) was to put her personal pleasures before duty and country. I recommend this book to anyone whose primary recollection of Diana was the American-style hysteria of her funeral.	2002-04-17

London is my second home and I've read many histories of her. As a companion volume, Ackroyd's book might be acceptable.

Nevertheless, the focus of the two is different. Dizikes focuses on institutions, Davis on individual singers. The popular press has overplayed Davis's assessment of today's singers (less than 100 pages). It's a solid history by one who has listened carefully to many records and read (it appears) every contemporary press report. As a journalist, Davis writes very well--though not as well as J.B.

Bravo Barnhardt! More, more!	1997-09-29

She condemns Charles for being too aloof, Sarah for being too forward, the Queen Mother as ice in velvet, the Queen as velvet in ice. No movement of the House of Windsor, whatever it is, escapes her poison pen. Does no one please this truly disagreeable author?  Still, I have to admit . . . I couldn't put the book down.	1997-09-24
