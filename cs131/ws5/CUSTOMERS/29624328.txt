Parker really is a very good storyteller, he just perpetuates such strange ideas.  Like the idea that a selfish is worthy of working to keep.  The ex-wife in this story is actually worse than Susan Silverman, yet the hero stubbornly refused to acknowledge her worthlessness, although he does flirt with the idea.  An okay read.	2004-11-07

Why he can't get a hold of himself and rid himself of such a life-wasting creature is beyond me.  Between her and Susan Silverman, you gotta wonder about Parker.	2004-11-07

Going back and forth between new hero Jesse Stone and a criminal planning the heist to end all heists, the excitement builds towards a satisfying end.  One fly in the ointment, Stone hasn't been able to shake his selfish (...) ex-wife.  In stalker like fashion, she has followed him to Paradise and installed herself. . . not wanting him and but not wanting him to be free either.,  Why is it when a male does this to an ex-wife he is considered evil, but Parker has this creature do this, and some how he actually thinks it's romantic or something.  Can't help but wonder about Parker's mentality.  But a good read, nonetheless.  Hopefully he will see the light, and dump her.  She really adds nothing to the story.	2004-10-21

Not apart of the Elvis Cole series, he takes on an exciting and serious subject matter - bombs.  I found this extremely interesting because he wrote this before 9/11.

I understand Spenser has a problem with women because he is soooo very in love with self-centered Susan; this has caused him to think she is perfect and all other women suffer in comparison (why does this seem unreal).  But, and this is a big but, Parker needs to stop portraying the damsels in distress as being so trashy and unworthy of being saved.  Really.  Between his strange attraction to perfect Susan and his attraction and admiration of the perfect Hawk, I'm getting the impression that Spenser is in the closet.  Would explain alot.	2004-09-26

Especially his understanding that alot of the blame for illiteracy is to laid at the student's door.  They know they have a problem, but do nothing to seek help and correct the problem.  I find it strange that Spenser will decide on whether or not a damsel in distress is worth the effort based on her appearance.

Spenser was okay, although I never got a clear feeling as to why he would care about a bad-tempered, humorless, vicious (...) like Rachel Wallace.  Like most humorless people, she took herself and her ideas way too serious.  And like most feminists I have known (and I am a female), she hates being stereotyped yet attacks Spenser over and over again with her own sterotypes about masculine men.

The period in a book where the author must establish the characters is quite often boring.  But not for this author - the characters and plotline was laid out in a very slick format.

Once again assigned to a case that touches Harry's damaged soul, he works his way through this mystery all the while dealing with soul-searching questions about himself.  I will not give too much a way about the plot, but this has quite a few twists and turns.  Just when you feel that Harry will finally be happy, that idea is abruptly snatched away from you.

An excellent character from an excellent book (they made a movie out of Blood Work with Clint Eastwood). In this book, the character collides with Harry Bosch, with extremely unpleasant results. Don't get me wrong, this is a terrific read. But I did not enjoy seeing two &quot;good guy&quot; characters duke it out. Each character was great within their own stories, and I would have preferred a collaboration rather than a collision in a cross-over book like this.

This is very satisfying; especially when combined with the &quot;poetic justice&quot; ending. I don't really like the way he portrays the upper brass as being perfectly willing to sacrifice an old cop to an animalistic mob. Although the way he portrays journalists as immoral and unethical as long as they get good copy seems very realistic which is eerie when you remember Connelly started out as a journalist. And portraying Bosch as understanding and even having sympathy with the riot mentality is rather unbelievable. As a cop, he would understand that society cannot allow and condone groups or sub-groups to go on savage, blood-thirsty rampages because they are angry. This is a city in a civlized country, not a jungle. <br />  <br /> But, overall, an excellent read.	2004-08-02

Eastwood like this story enough to star in the movie made about the book. This character in a later book interfaces with the series character Harry Bosch.

This first one was a little slow, but personalites and characters needed to be defined.  Hopefully they will become quicker and more humorous (in keeping with Ms Austen's humor).	2004-07-08

His widowed stepmother would greatly have preferred his glorious death in battle on the Continent.  She has no desire to relinquish her position, and she has hoped that her own son Martin would inherit.<br />The Earl, in his quiet way, quickly makes a conquest of two eligible young ladies on the scene, but it becomes almost immediately apparent that someone at Stanyon would prefer to have him die by a means more sudden than old age.<br />Georgette Heyer's comical genius never fails to deliver delight.  Much better than anything Jane Austen ever wrote!!!	2004-07-03

A little over a year ago someone recommended the Prey series to me while recovering from a major surgery.  I tore threw them at a speed I had never attained before.  The great thing about this series is he just keeps getting better and better.  Most books start out boring while laying out the plot . . . not John Sandford; you open one of his books and BAM, you're off!!!  I would recommend this book to any one who enjoys a fast-paced thrill a minute . . .hard to put down!	2004-07-03

This was an excellent read, fast paced and exciting.  I only had one problem with Hannah.  When Hannah faced her reconstruction surgery, she voiced doubts and fears about being &quot;put under&quot; for the surgery, as if she had never experienced this before.  I thought this was strange, since this was a reconstructive surgery after a mastectomy.  Surely Hannah didn't have this mastectomy while wide awake.  That was the only inconsistency in the story.  Otherwise, a great read . . .I highly recommend it.	2004-07-01

Her involvement and subsequent investigation don't seem too far removed from reality.  Hannah's experiences with surviving cancer, and the recovery ring true and add a different dimension to her ruminations.  Good read, would highly recommend it to anyone!	2004-07-01

But, unfortunately, to make the story run smoothly, each writer had to suppress their regular writing style to create a generic style.  Nice effort, though.  Wouldn't recommend buying it . . . get it from the library.	2004-07-01

While not being a ordinary murder mystery, this does offer suspense when you realize every chapter reveals more information about her comatose husband. He turns out to be one of the most selfish cads I've read about in recent books. What makes this delightful is Ms. Glass's sense of humor about the thoroughly dislikable cast of characters. What a ride!	2004-06-29

A challenging mystery, a hint of romance, and a more thoughtful, less mean-spirited Jacqueline.  Too bad Ms. Peters stopped here.  Enjoyable romp.	2004-06-28

She rips up the commercialization of the bodice-ripper genre, and obviously has a great time doing it.  Some of her characters were a little over-the-top, but much more enjoyable than her second installment in this short series.  Enjoyable read.	2004-06-28

I loved it.  The author knew how to build the suspense, while also creating a tense anticipation.  Claire, clearly torn by her ambivalent feelings towards the man she was forced to marry, begins to fall under his spell, as well as her new home, the plantation Sans Songe (Without Illusion). The story twists down to a satisfying conclusion, leaving the reader searching for more books by Patricia Maxwell. It took me many years to discover that she also publishes under the name Jennifer Blake.  Which left me with a whole new list of books to read.  Excellent read, I would recommend it to any one who enjoys romance spun around mystery!	2004-06-28

The mystery evolves around the going-ons of a English country house party, attended by a bunch of ho-hum characters.  When they start to die, it gives Jacqueline a mystery to solve, but the people are so unlikable you can't help but think, &quot;Why bother?&quot;  And Ms. Kirby comes off as somewhat mean-spirited in this one.  Oh well.	2004-06-28

The hero is incredibly sexy, without any real depth.  And the heroine was hard to care a great deal about.  I think the worst part was the epilogue, which introduced a rather sinister character without any kind of explanatin, leaving the reader hanging in an uncomfortable position.  Would only recommend to someone extremely bored.	2004-06-28

The author most definitely has writing about the sultry, spooky bayou down pat.  The romance in this story was a little strained, but did work out in the end.  Over all, a good read.	2004-06-28

This is a timeless story of a young Quaker woman, raised in a strict religious community.  When she finally leaves home to work at Tancred, she feels free for the first time.  But fear starts to intrude on her new life and she ultimately needs to rely upon her faith in God to save her from the horror she slowly uncovers.  The end satisfies, leaving the reader to wish Diane Pearson had written more.  Excellent read; highly recommend.	2004-06-28

Just as grown children leave home to start a new phase in their life, so does their middle-aged parents.  Jacqueline does a fine job disregarding the past to open up a new and exciting phase in her life which includes helping a group of young graduate students solve a murder.  Her intelligence and past experience leaves her prepared for every eventuality!  A delightful romp!	2004-06-28

The only interest in this book is salacious:  Monica, Monica, Monica!  And that he shrugs off as him merely being a bad boy.  A man his age, who is also the leader of one of the most important countries in the free world, and he is just a bad boy?  Well, he had eight years to make an important contribution to history, a lasting impact on the world.  Instead he chose to be a bad boy.  Nothing but a huge yawn!!	2004-06-27
