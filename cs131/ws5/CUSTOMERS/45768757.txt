US	45768757	R1DQ2QTGOQIXGF	1594480001	659516630	The Kite Runner	Books	3	30	34	N	Y	Very Good then Very Predictable	The first 3/4 of The Kite Runner is spectacular -- harrowing and exciting at the same time. I felt deeply for the characters and sensed I understood them well and fully. There are six extremely well-fleshed out characters, each complex and with complex relationships to one another -- due to family, politics and personality. And it is a page-turner, the events captivating even in the midst of multi-layered brutality.    The last section however, about 150 pages, is less interesting. The book becomes predictable to the point of ridiculous coincidences; the characters lack the depth of the first part; it becomes purely plot-driven, and a very major plot flaw is overlooked. At this point it's a matter of waiting for the plot to unfold in the ways it invariably must, given its now [ironically] Hollywood/American style. At times, during this final quarter, the only surprising elements are its sugar-sweet sentimentality. The reading slows down, and there was no more page turning for me, but to get to the end. It would make a fine Ron Howard vehicle.    Overall, it's not terrible and much of it is quite good. But given the final chunk, my opinion is that it's over-praised and its Hollywood-style plot devices toward the end are unfortunately ill-suited to the material. And just to point out: it's an accessible read, not \\"intellectual\\" (though I realize that comes out as an insult...it is what it is, fast and easy reading even though the material is polical and brutal).	2005-09-06
US	45768757	R1CADMGSXUB8N8	0312422199	274852501	Regarding the Pain of Others	Books	4	8	11	N	Y	A Fine Career Bookend	I think this book would be more aptly called \\"Regarding War Photography\\" or \\"War Photography as Metaphor\\" (keeping Sontag-style titles intact). Unfortunately misnamed, this is a book about the effect of war photography on the viewer. It's about representation and what the image means to us, what the absence of an image does or doesn't mean to us. Not a book about the pain of others, it demonstrates how images of others' pain shape our views of their pain.    Sontag writes a brief history of war imagery, beginning with the advent of photography (the result of the amount of time required to take a picture) to faster and lighter cameras (likely to capture, rather than to re-recreate or to show only war's aftermath), to television, to the present (the internet, constant access and the expectation of constant access to images). She goes back, pre-photography, to discuss a few specific paintings that depict war or other suffering. She describes the methodology of the photographs--often naming specific images and photographers--analyzes their impact, how the images are viewed during the war and, because of the images, the war thought of by future generations.    Her interpretations are largely familiar and unchanged since \\"On Photography,\\" but \\"Regarding the Pain of Others\\" discusses only war photography. That her analyses are expected doesn't detract from them; Sontag's input about this topic is valuable -- some early war photographs are staged; specific atrocities have become more urgent or real after being viewed; photojournalism is given a special veracity unlike other art forms; images shape our memories of wars that took place in prior generations. Sontag is clear about disbelieving in \\"collective memory\\" and states that it is the artifacts, photographs, we are left with that determine our feelings.    Worth seeking out is a shorter piece Sontag wrote called \\"Regarding the Torture of Others\\" (quite true to its title) after the Abu Ghirab prison photographs were released. In a way, it's a finer example of what this book achieves, though far more condensed.    Toward the end, she revisits \\"On Photography.\\" She's recently re-read it and isn't sure if she agrees with certain elements. She debates herself in a way, though in my opinion, only in the smaller scheme of her general argument about representation and its relationship to fact and result. On a personal level, I was glad to see her revisit \\"On Photography.\\" It read as a celebration of her groundbreaking work and ways of thinking about photographic representation. The circular nature, yet diffierent topics, discussed at the start and near end of her brilliant life and career rendered this, for me, satisfying and somewhat sad. I will miss her flow of opinions.	2005-08-22
US	45768757	R211UGFUAF6MEE	0794817912	77357491	Guide Book of United States Coins 2005: The Official Red Book	Books	3	22	23	N	N	The Red Book, This Year	The Red Book is the guide. I recommend it. If you don't have a coin collector's guide to retail pricing, the Red Book is the first one to buy. Know this: The Red Book is Whitman's guide to retail value, and the Blue Book is Whitman's dealer-price guide.    I'll put my biggest issue with 2005's edition up front: The hard cover version, at least, has given us a wretched font change since its 2004 edition. It's a smaller and thinner typeface -- I don't know the name of the font, but I think I'll take out my loupe just to look up a coin!      The color images (last year = black and white) are nice. Two caveats:  1) For \\"the guide\\" I can't help but wonder why their visual examples aren't top-of-the-line (e.g., a photo of a double die or a 3/2 are typically not stellar examples),  2) Along with the color images, the paper has changed to a more magazine-type feel, and is of thinner/lighter-weight variety. It has more pages, but is actually a thinner book than 2004's.  As you \\"break it in,\\" the pages become easier to turn.    2005 has one extra grading category, adding another level of price. This still doesn't equal as many categories as current grading companies use. If we think of it as a price guide, and not a book about grading (i.e., there is some, but not comprehensive information about how to grade), it does its job. The number of grades, and which grades, given for each coin differ from coin to coin, but as an example it can read:  EF40, AU50, MS60, MS65, PF, without the in-between numbers grading companies use.     Guide vs. true-retail price: One highly ignored issue is that the prices don't address or reflect online / auction coin-buying retail value, which is a large market. So, for selling online, or buying online, this is truly a guidebook, not definitive. A coin can sell online for twice, or half, the listed Red Book value. Or wildly to either side. I would guess the prices reflect more of what to expect to pay at a coin shop.    Regarding another review Iread at Amazon -- 2004's edition does have the coin history, too, and I agree that it is a very interesting read.     Overall, if you're price-conscious I'd say buy a used one from last year. My primary reason for writing that is because it is so much more a guide than a set-in-stone reality. If you've not bought a Red Book yet, or want to see this year's model, do. I'm glad I did, and the more I use it, the more used to it I am becoming.	2005-05-26

Lamott does an excellent job, though, partly because this is not really a how-to-write book. It's far more like taking a writing workshop with an author. It read, for me, as though I was around fellow writers, in the sense of the camaraderie and inspiration we feel at workshops (minus the feedback).<br /><br />Lamott is funny, very funny, and her stories and anecdotes feel true. She writes our lives as writers, what goes into writing, how horrid, and how great we can feel. She offers thoughts about approach and feelings, mainly--and at her best--through anecdote. Take what you need (\\"Write as though your parents are dead,\\" is a line I loved because someone else out there does that too!) and leave the rest.<br /><br />I skimmed around the chapters about plot and character. I don't care for the one-size-fits-all advice, such as: \\"Plot begins with character; your characters tell you the plot.\\" I don't care for an author who tells me whether or not to know the end before I begin, or at what stage in writing the end comes to focus. Rewriting is something that differs from author to author -- Lamott favors a huge, messy first draft, which is fine but not a prescription.<br /><br />Lamott tells us origins of her writing, large and small (a book written for a friend dying of cancer to snippets on index cards). She shares something true to herself in this book, which is a fine example of practicing what she preaches; she devotes a full chapter to \\"writing a gift.\\"  Her humor and her suprising wisdom make \\"Bird by Bird\\" both enjoyable and valuable. I liked its workshop, teacher/student format and the syllabus-type chronology of its chapters. The last chapter ends with her saying that on the last day of class she hands out a poem, which she then hands out to us.<br /><br />I'd avoided this book for years. People I know love it, swear by it, but I just don't like the genre. Finally I read it, and I get it. It's good. (It helps, too, that Lamott is a published author, and not a How-To writer who writes How To but doesn't do.)<br /><br />Aside: Someone had given me Joyce Carol Oates's \\"Faith of a Writer,\\" which I began to read after reading \\"Bird by Bird.\\" It's rather similar in its personal/anecdotal, non-how-to approach, and also written by an accomplished writer.and not a How-To writer who writes How To but doesn't do.)

I look at it all the time. Aside from the Latin-English and English-Latin dictionaries, it has information about usage -- conjugations, declensions, what each tense is used for, examples of conjugating in every verb and declining in every noun form (including the more obscure, such as dependent and deponent verbs), etc.  <br /> <br />It's in here. It's far more than a dictionary. If it isn't here, that means you need a straight-out usage or text book; this little dictionary goes far and above an average little dictionary. I've been using the same copy since high school and it's still next to my desk all the time. I don't even have a career related to Latin; I just love it. I love it for my own writing (in English), and simply my own edification.	2005-02-25

I haven't come across a poorly-written piece in here -- poetry, memoir, or fiction. I wish these authors were getting the attention they deserve. I'm impressed, too, by the egalitarian choices of the editors. If I remember correctly, Rick Moody is a contributing editor yet also received an \\"honorary mention\\" for a submission.    I've got one complaint that bothers me like crazy, in both last year's and this year's editions: Please put the original publication of each piece either in the contents or in an appendix of its own. The contents include the author, title and genre. One appendix gives us contributing presses, which it seems are all that submitted whether or not accepted for publication; and another appendix gives us all contributing presses over the years.  The book is very long and in order to learn which story, poem, etc., was originally published where, we need to go to the work itself - an unweildy task when curious to read the writing originating from \\"X\\" publication.      Otherwise, truly, surprisingly excellent writing. I buy it to see writing trends; I end up enjoying the book. I pick it up for a quick look and end up reading, then reading some more. Great, great collection.	2005-02-19

I didn't like that I found it, by the end, anti-climactic -- I felt no revelation about identity, lack of identity,  meaning or lack of meaning with respect to identity.  The book's intelligence was compelling enough to make it work for me, as was its plot. Until the final chapters.  Simplicity, brevity and internal consistency turned from deft continuity to a scattered unrealism that was both at odds with the book's tenor and ultimately led not to knowing, not to not-knowing, nor to anything fully realized.  However, because of its smart writing and compelling theme, I am genuinely happy to have read it. Some prose is beautiful and interesting enough to be a pleasure in itself and \\"Identity,\\" for me, is an example of such prose.  In that sense: if the medium is the message, as  Marshall McLuhan wrote, then it did fulfill.  Ironically or not, then, \\"Identity\\" itself lacks an ultimate critical identity.	2005-01-26
US	45768757	R3VU5PNIOG9EGP	0471679526	312680518	The Case for Israel	Books	4	9	28	N	Y	Very worthwhile; a bit turgid	Dershowitz offers a good, solid history of the region that takes us much further back in time than other books about Israel and Palestine. He shows maps of the territory, then--all the thens--and now.  He tells us up front he has a \\"case\\" -- no bones about a slant; this is a book written by a person with an opinion, a strong desire to educate, and a sense of mandate to prove his correctness.  He invites disagreement, though my sense is the invited disagreement is more applicable to smaller issues than to primary matters. This edition also has an interesting introduction about his encounters with college students around the world during his book tour of its 1st edition.     Dershowitz favors a two-state solution.  Each chapter begins with an anti-semitic comment or question, then quotes sources of that opinion--often Noam Chomsky or Said, always someone well-known--he follows that with the \\"truth\\" in one succinct paragraph, and the remainder of the chapter is an argument in support of this truth.     He offers a sort of apology for going back in history, with a caveat about its necessity for understanding the region, alongside the opposite reasoning for a \\"statute of limitations\\" about looking too far in the past. I felt that, within the book, the history held the most interesting, most direct, and most factual information.  Included are details of Britian's role; Balfour; Oslo; immigration during the late 1800's; population data at various times; Palestine's relationship within/to Syria, Jordan, other countries; and fascinating to me about the land's progression, The Roman Empire's division of the region (Palestine was then named Philistine, an \\"outcast\\" area).  The history of the region and its cultivation is itself one of the most powerful arguments as a case for Israel, and much of it is not only \\"underpublicized\\" but its opposite so often quoted as to have become accepted as fact.    The bad part: His citations are dicey and his language legalese. It's not horrifically legalese, but enough to be a bit of a snoozer. I felt I was listening to a lawyer make a case, which in reality I was, but it read a bit too much like a courtroom presentation or an academic/legal text.  Dicey citations: While the quotes at the start of the chapter are followed by the speaker or author of them, each fact within the chapter has a footnote, and there are so many per page you won't be running to the back of the book every paragraph to see their origin. Sometimes he quotes sources with names like propalestine.org with the same respect he gives world leaders, but he doesn't tell us who owns these websites who or wrote these words.     Somehow no matter how interested I was in each thing Dershowitz wrote--and I truly was; I felt he was smart, dedicated to the issue, extremely knowledgeable--I was slightly bored, or I became more so as I continued to read. At the start I was fully captivated. I believe it's a stylistic flaw, a [turgid, to me] style more appropriate for a \\"Case,\\" as the title says, than for the general public, his intended audience. In a way, this intense case-making, a footnote for each fact, seems to have rendered the use of less-credible-than-necessary sources. The historic information truly stands on its own as a solid and nearly inarguable argument. To give credibility to dicey sources is to dilute his own case (and fill up the margins with unnecessary footnotes... should I go to the back of the book this time, again, or shouldn't I?).    Overall: What a great person, and I never knew before I saw this book. I'm impressed by his dedication, his knowledge, his sense of duty to take action and to educate.  I was unaware he'd been this interested and involved, and this book has given me more respect for Alan Dershowitz.  There is a lot of good information in here, and I learned a lot from it, but stylistically it could use some work in order to read less like a legal case. Odd to say, but it seems a bit less rigidity of format might be a help.	2004-12-10

History of Taoism, 2. Definition of Taoist Concepts, and 3. Taoism in Practice.<br /><br />The second section is easily the best, most objective and least analytic.  The authors define Tao, Te, wu-wei, ying and yang, p'u and chi. Taoism *is* \\"simple\\"; it isn't easy to practice, but far too many authors tend to analyze and over-analyze while defining, which is the precise antithesis of Tao.  The second section of this book takes a solid Taoist approach by simply defining the terms; you use them your Way.<br /><br />The third section, Taoist Practice, represents the authors' mindset. It is how they practice Taoism -- they write about some Taoist arts but not others and don't mention that this was their writing approach. Likewise for The first section, Taoist History. It reads as well-researched but speaks only of certain elements.<br /><br />The problematic part is that book is written as though all concepts presented are in equal measure the essence of--and necessary to--Taoism,  with no mention of elements left out. I bought this for a friend who was interested in the basics of Taoism, and I picked it up to see what I'd be giving him. I ended up reading it; it's very short and fast and I liked it a lot.  I thought highly of it.  Then when I gave it to him I found that I wanted to explain which elements could be appropriate or not for him, or what he doesn't need to take as \\"fact\\" of Taoism as it's presented here.<br /><br />I've considered Taoism indespensible in my life for over a decade and while this book is quite a good introduction, it has a somewhat one-sided view that's presented as universal, which makes this a good primer course but requires supplemental information. It's unfortunate because the material is good -- if only they would have written that the third chapter, for example, is about the ways *they* practice: e.g., martial art is one of the Toaist arts, much detail is given to it while other Taoist arts go unmentioned. As a first book about Taoism it might be difficult to differentiate between their thoughts and others'.<br /><br />Overall: Good book. The 2nd section section is worth the price of admission, easily, for its simple definitions of typically over-described concepts. But parts one and three should be taken as the less objective of the three sections.unmentioned.

Also, I was expecting a more objective presentation about the lives of the current generation of Palestinians, as it seemed this would be.  I was interested in the book because an Israeli wrote it, reviews said he was patriotic yet sympathetic and that the stories were the human side of Palestinian life -- at least that was my impression and what I'd hoped to read.    Grossman spent time living with Palestinians.  I think he feels he did put aside his own preconceptions to learn about Palestian life from Palestinians.  At first I, too, felt he succeeded.  The first few chapters--each chapter is a sort of short narrative of its own--were well-crafted and combined history with in-the-moment accounts.      As I continued to read on, I couldn't help but feel Grossman's own view and anger come through.  His anger wasn't, to me, generalized frustration, but patriotic and with a \\"pro-\\" and \\"anti-\\" feel to it.  He writes of Palestinians that they've been taught for generations, that it's so ingrained as to be nearly inescapable, to feel and express hatred. So, too, I felt, Grossman couldn't see past his own bias.  He could for certain individuals, but the deeper I read the more bias I sensed.  This isn't inherently negative.  What is negative about this portrait is that he proclaims non-partisanship, and seems to believe he is a neutral voice, but ultimately he isn't.    \\"The Yellow Wind\\" isn't bad, not horrible, and it's readable.  It's worthwhile.  But distinguishing lines between fact, fiction, humanity and nationalism became a bit too difficult -- such that I questioned, for example, his factual presentation of history or even observations at times.  Given this less-than-required objectivity in order to render the book what it is, and that it is somewhat dated, I'd say it's not necessary reading.  I realize I disagree with the other reviews.  Perhaps due to the current time in history, it takes on a different feel, and I'm certainly open to feeling differently about Grossman's work in the future.   But I felt it could have offered so much more, given how it came about--Grossman, an Israeli, living with Palestinians for awhile--but perhaps that, too, is inherent to the deep-rooted emotions between Israelis and Palestinians.	2004-11-11
US	45768757	RS9H2G3GOSS6Y	0684801469	11530247	A Farewell To Arms	Books	4	4	4	N	N	I prefer his short stories	The writing style is 'The New Yorker''s wet dream: self-conscious, overwritten, and smart.  At novel length, over-written becomes, to me, truly over-written.  \\"The Snows of Kilamanjaro\\" ranks in my top 5 short stories.  I love his style; I love his writing.  But this novel goes on and on and on.  I hadn't read it before, and though I recall loving \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" long ago, I had to start skimming about 3/4 way through \\"A Farewell to Arms.\\"  It was too repitious.  I don't mean it isn't wonderful in many ways, but how much of the same tone, style, content can we  read before it begins to feel tedious?<br /><br />Per the other comments, and official review: I'm surprised by this being called \\"sparse prose.\\" One of the more striking and interesting elements is his use of run-on sentences -- truly, run-on sentences, complete with many uses of the word \\"and.\\" He does this in such an interesting way, it's really sort of awe-inspiring.  Very interesting.<br /><br />I wouldn't call Henry detached or nihilistic as others have; I think he's stoic.  I think his greatest personality trait is his stoicism in the face of great adversity.  This, in conjunction with the writing style, makes the book.<br /><br />I much prefer the war chapters to the \\"love\\" chapters.  Since I didn't feel Henry falling in love, I felt little for their interaction until the end. Though, again, all elements become rather tedious.  The chapters go something like this: war, war, hospital, love, war, war, war, love.... So I skimmed (I hate skimming).  Then, at the end, the last few chapters are genuinely suspenseful.  The end is breathtaking.  The person who reads detachment here, I believe, is missing the emotional impact.<br /><br />But -- this same end, this same style, can be found in his shorter works, and one doesn't need to skim or become bored.  So I recommend buying a book of short stories, if you've become Hemingway-dismayed after reading this book, yet still hold out hope.  The dialogue is far more interesting to read when not novel-length, in my opinion.  (Agreed, too much alcohol for my taste -- but, it is what it is, and I always value the time in history, the place and person from where the art came.)<br /><br />Four stars for sheer talent.  And for documenting WWI through fiction.	2004-11-05

I'm so lucky that my high school Latin teacher, in the early 80s, had us read this alongside Virgil, Horace, Ovid, etc.  I had never read \\"Winnie The Pooh\\" before! -- and read it only after reading both \\"Winnie Ille Pu\\" then, much later, \\"The Tao of Pooh.\\"  You don't need to be as weird or backward as I am, though, to love this.  The book is terrific.  To all Latin teachers: bring this to class, please.  It's wonderful.  The students in my class loved it, finding it all very familiar to them as we reached each part.  It wasn't easy to translate--I don't know how the newer ones compare (\\"Harry Potter\\" in Latin, etc.)--but in 3rd or 4th year high school Latin, it was at our level and a lot of fun. The students who knew Winnie the Pooh found translating it easier than I did, as in: \\"Oh, this is the part when...\\", thus were able to extrapolate through its accessibility. For them it was a break from difficult or unfamilar Latin writing, rendering it Useful through familiarity with its English version. For me, I got to know Pooh through Latin, and I've loved Pooh and the gang ever since.	2004-10-29

I liked, very much, hearing Bill Clinton speak his story but was also disappointed that it was abridged.  I don't know what was eliminated or why.    My main complaint: I thought Clinton was overdefensive, and unneccesarily so.  At times he distances the reader through his anger and/or editorializing of facts.  He is a large and already historic figure whose memoir and feelings are of great import and significance.  His defensive stance detracted from hearing about his life.      For me, some of the best elements were his personal stories - the passages from his youth and growing up, his mother, step-father, father's death, and brother.  I would have liked far more of this.  Much of the in-presidential-office details are part of public record and read as a littany of numbers and vote counts.  His personal feelings and experiences growing up, as told by him, are matchless, singular.  Particularly wonderful was the way he interwove his life, surroundings, reactions, and political feelings and the way these shaped his career and philosophies.  An example is living in the south in the 1960's, his reaction to people's treatment of one another, and the civil rights movement.  He tells this in the context of his mother's influence, his step-father's abusiveness, what he saw in the world, and the ways these combinations shaped him.    His boyhood is a remarkable and open story.  I was with him to Oxford, his feelings about education and military, advisors he sought.  I loved his meeting Hillary.  His humanness, as told by him, is amazing, an amazing, open and honest addition to history.  Particularly in his voice (literal, audio), it's marvelous.    His life in office: This part was overlong to me.  At times his days as president were so repetitive to me that, as an example, at one point I didn't notice the CD had begun again until it skipped to track two: I heard an entire first CD track after the end of a CD without realizing -- that's pretty bad.    He skims certain details in poor ways, I thought.  Paula Jones, for example: he tells us he didn't harrass her, as she'd accused him.  But he doesn't tell us what did happen.  I felt, if he's going to bring this up, tell us what did happen, not just what didn't.      He seemed on too much of a mission of public self-redemption, and I don't feel it was needed.  He has nothing to redeem.  If you disagreed with him before, this book won't change that.  He needed only to tell his story and when he does, it's a most honest, open, raw and emotional account.  He is an amazing person.  The way history and his life circumstances shaped him, his career and his points of view are fascinating.  His childhood hurt to hear.  I would have liked Roger Clinton to return, in the book, after childhood years and I would have preferred more life,  fewer numbers and daily vote counts, and far less defensiveness.  He makes it seem as though he has something to defend.  I do understand that for him at that time this was \\"his life.\\"  He's angry, and that's human too.  But he doesn't say that he's angry and feels victimized, which clearly he feels - this isn't expressed as a feeling but rather fact (\\"the right-wing conspiracy...\\").  This, side-by-side with his writings about childhood *feelings* are less evolved in delivery and perhaps in personal understanding.      Overall, a fabulously important, if flawed, memoir.  But people are flawed and it is a memoir.  Great kudos for his openness and expression of emotions I imagine a \\"private figure\\" would have trouble revealing.  He reveals.  It is well worth reading.	2004-10-07

The poetry is remarkably, shockingly good; unique, brazen, naked.    Some of the Cocktail Mix: body, mortality, sex, haste, despair, brutality, waste, want, and men. Disease with a voice.  Although it's not the book to do this with, because it is so intense, I read nearly straight through at once; I couldn't stop.  I couldn't stop being amazed.   I loved his use of punctuation, line breaks, rhythm, alliteration, syntax, empty and full visual space.  It is beautiful poetry and it is hard.	2004-09-10
US	45768757	R3H49BGWOZFKT4	0679723439	902786352	Despair	Books	5	5	6	N	Y	Doppelganger Mystery	--  So, so wonderful. If you haven't read the book description, I recommend you don't. The one-sentence description reveals something not revealed in the book until nearly its end. If you have read the description, don't worry - it doesn't detract anything. I recommend this book, particularly as a plot-driven, less ethereal read for those who prefer that side of Nabokov (not to say his stamp is missing). Also interesting is that it was written in the 1930's and much revised by Nabokov in the 1960's, in English, after a literal Russian-to-English translation by his son. So the historic value that I find so interesting in his early work is there, yet his skill-level is far higher than in the books of his I've read from the 20's and 30's.  To me, this plot, a doppelganger/crime in Nabokov's hands, is an original -- the way it unfolds, its structure; its breadth of characters, concepts and details. Literature is blessed by Nabokov. And Despair, brilliant, is an \\"easy\\" read, a suspenseful, highly enjoyable book.    Spoilers, if you haven't read other reviews: I love an unreliable narrator, and thought the pacing with which Hermann's credence becomes questionable was seamless. But what I want to say most is something Nabokov denies in his Foreward. However, having read some of the other Forewards from this reissue series, he had a clear disrespect for those who \\"need a Foreward to explain the book\\" [Quote from the Foreward of \\"The Defense\\"], so part of me thinks he's messing with us in his intros.  In any event (intentional on VN's part or not), this is something I loved:   the political implication of the main way Hermann's credibility is sketchy -- his likeness to another person. Hermann himself mentions the word Marxism very near the end, and when he ultimately concedes that he and Felix may look different, says, All people are really alike anyway. I thought about the book's entirety, the time in history it was written, and the ideology / social construct itself. As anAmerican, at this time in history, I found this particularly powerful. Driving this politic home in \\"Despair\\" is their precise opposite lots: Hermann wealthy; Felix poor, a beggar, someone who goes to Hermann for money. The rich and the poor men, in Despair, are doubles, \\"alike in every way,\\" Hermann writes.      And now, I'll be quiet. Other people have written wonderful reviews that mention different great details of \\"Despair.\\" Stellar work.  Amazing characters, so well-drawn, as always.	2004-09-08

Brautigan turns out to be an articulate author, and she expresses her feelings very openly.  I feel callous saying that this is an enlightening read for R. Brautigan fans, because much of I. Brautigan's drive derives from her troubled feelings about him. But the book is also a biography of her father, the ways he lived (as well as the way he died, which is vividly described). While reading, I felt it was a reliable biography, from the POV of someone very close to him, who understood him, and had her own experiences with respect to growing up his daughter; it was a reliable/subjective biography, which turned out to have merits of its own that an outsider can't match -- for better or worse. What it loses in objectivity, it more than overcomes. <br /> <br />No doubt I. Brautigan has had many other life experiences too, but very impressively she keeps to her misssion to tell the story of her father, his life, his death, her relationship to and evolving feelings about it.  I did not expect it to be as well-done as it is. Kudos, as well as my sympathy to the author who indeed had an unfortunate and difficult time due to his suicide. Regarding R. Brautigan, fans will appreciate her anectodes and stories, despite their coming from the place they do -- of having to learn that she can not \\"catch death.\\"	2004-09-07
US	45768757	RS7EG9T10JW7Z	0451527585	602341169	Leaves of Grass (Signet Classics)	Books	4	13	15	N	N	About the Various Editions	I was familiar with the well-known poems and wanted to own \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" I'm not going to review the poetry, but describe, hopefully to help others figure out what took me some research, its various editions.     In 1855 Whitman self-published \\"Leaves of Grass\\" as a 12-poem book. Up to 1892, he added poems and revised the original twelve poems -- books also published under the same title, \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" In 1892, Whitman published (by then, recognized, not self-published) its final version, the edition he wanted to be thought the definitive \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" This is the commonly called \\"Deathbed Edition.\\" It contains over 300 poems. It does contain the original twelve, though not in their original or other previously-published forms. By then, they'd been many-times revised over the years, and released within other publications between the first and the last. In essence, \\"Leaves of Grass\\" was a nearly 40-year evolving work, under the same title, each edition containing the prior editions' poems further revised, plus additional poems.     I wanted to read the original poems. I also wanted to see their final versions, and was curious to see their evolution. I noticed that some books include so many evolutions of the poems/book, they fill at least two volumes. I wanted to own \\"Leaves of Grass\\" but I didn't need to become a scholar of it; I wanted to read the book. However, I didn't want only the Deathbed Edition -- I was both curious about the original and wanted to see more than 12 poems.      I decided to buy an edition of the book that contains the entire Deathbed Edition, plus a few of the poems in their original form, and some commentary. I believe, after researching, I found the best I could. That would be my recommendation: if this is your first purchase of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" make sure to see some poetry from 1855, some poetry from the Deathbed Edition, and some poetry in between. That is, if what you want to read is the poetry and not own a collector'sitem or only the \\"definitive edition,\\" as Whitman viewed it (Deathbed). To me, seeing only the final version detracts something from its core -- and after reading the poems and comparing them, I feel this even more -- so in that sense I disagree with Whitman; he chose to make public many books over 40 years, yet wanted only the last to be considered the true version.    As a reader, I find it unfortunate that this is a work that evolved over a lifetime under the same title; it renders each addition of poems to the book not books of their own, and also difficult to find on their own.  So, for me, the compromise was to choose a book that includes the Deathbed Edition and part of the original, without having to read multiple books, or 1,000 pages, or a scholarly journal (though I would love to see the full original 12 poems).    I understand a book will be released soon that includes both the full original (12 poems) and the full Deathbed Editions. I don't have it, so I don't know what else will be included.	2004-09-06
US	45768757	RHGY4JANKCSKK	0374525994	267797716	Desire: Poems	Books	3	4	9	N	Y	Okay, but not worth buying	-  This is a very short book.  I enjoyed some of its first half when I read it.  Then, but for two poems, I didn't even care to read the rest more than once.  I tried, but it had little to no emotional impact.  I love, love, love his interpretation of Catullus's Odi Et Amo -- love it.  I'd say it's worth the price of admission, but... there it is right in the book description above, to be easily printed out and saved (and only one version is in this book).  I couldn't get into the second half at all, the long (half-book length) poem based on Ovid's work.  I liked the idea more than its execution; I was bored.      The book is good; his style is good, but somehow only two poems stuck with me; \\"Odi Et Amo\\" (called Catullus: Excrucior here) and the one the other reviewer mentioned, with the line, \\"I wake and sleep and wake and sleep....\\"  I think reading the same number of poems of his, on the internet, would suffice.  If you love the Catulus poem like I do -- in its original, there are other English-speaking poets who've also written interesting interpretations -- I particularly like Ezra Pound's.	2004-09-02

It is a terrific, full anthology that includes much out-of-print material.  The poetry is stylistically wide in scope (from how-did-he-do that perfect to sparse, intense, free-verse); it has unique, emotionally-driven language choices, rhythm and content.  Its tenor is lugubrious, and its subject matter tends toward sex and religion.    This, as opposed to his individual books of poetry: The individual books are typically short and some are wonderful -- each is very different, thus liked by different tastes. If you don't own any Cohen books, buy this first -- it's got great poems (plus clips of prose, as from \\"Beautiful Losers\\").  The chapters are laid out by book and album title (lyrics are here, too); therefore, if/when you want another book after, you will know which one.  One thing I don't like about it is the change in poem titles from their originals.    This books ends when Cohen is in his 50's, at least in the previously unpublished poems at the end -- so, before the monastery part of his life, though religion is well part of him (he is Orthodox Jewish and views his Buddhism as compatible with his Judaism).  I'm not much a fan of his post-monastery work, and if I have one regret it's that I discovered Leonard Cohen within the past ten years, and never got to see him live.      Know, too, that Cohen was a published poet--well-known in Canada--before he recorded music. He began to play guitar while reading poetry -- it went over well!	2004-08-24
US	45768757	REIO87KQ1AG13	0679720200	882163178	The Stranger	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	Existentialism, Nihilism or Cruelty	<br />Mersault is an existential person; he goes to work each day, comes home each evening, stops when something stops him, and goes along with events that cross his path.  At what point does this turn to nihilism, and more importantly, at what point do we stop thinking of his actions as a philosophy and begin to judge them or him? <br /> <br />Mersault is complicit when his neighbor asks him to compose a letter to exact revenge on a woman whom the neighbor says did him wrong.  Vengeance seems an appropriate reaction to Mersault, so he writes the letter.  Subsequently he hears its result through his wall: the woman arrives, and the neighbor beats her.  Another neighbor abuses his dog, Mersault tells us.  He doesn't intervene nor form a judgment.  Marie asks him, \\"Do you love me?\\"  Mersault replies that it doesn't have much meaning, but he doesn't think so.  He then agrees to marry her when she asks.  Our first neighbor, rumored to be a pimp, who has beaten a woman, invites Mersault on a trip.  Sure, he'll go.  He goes where the tide takes him. <br /> <br />On this trip, the `thugs' behind the event with the woman arrive.  While alone on the beach, unprovoked, Mersualt shoots one of them - once, then four more times.  Why?  He was not asked to nor provoked; in his mind he was, in short, being himself, though he has a hard time articulating this as a courtroom defense.  <br /> <br />The prosecution shows Mersault as an unfeeling callous person who premeditatedly murdered.  He didn't pre-plan; we know this of Mersault.  He did commit homicide, unprovoked.  Now we have societal questions: is his personality, or philosophy of life, relevant?  Does his past behavior, that one could interpret as callous, have anything to do with murder?  No tears at mother's funeral, behaving in concert with a man in a manner that results in harm, then befriending the man and taking the fateful trip with him.  Legally (another topic entirely), no.  The event on its own and his defense, ashe sees it: is it valid or is there a point when one has the \\"right\\" to judge another?  If the other's actions do harm--murder--what should we do? <br /> <br />Mersault is Mersault.  Camus places this existential character in the most questionable circumstance.  His personality caused the death of another person.  And that's the book.  Mersault has thoughts and opinions; not many, so he doesn't speak much, but he knows who he is and is never dishonest about it.  The back cover of the edition of the book I hold tells me Mersault is a victim.  Is this true?  Or is there not an answer to that question?  What does society do when someone commits murder for no reason other than he is who he is?  The penal system (another different topic) is atrocious - but that isn't what the book is about.  So if an existential, easy going life leads to behavior that is complicit in events that hurt or kill others, do we switch the \\"ism\\" to a judgmental word - in the book, amorality (his atheism plays role as well in others' judgment of Mersault); in psychology, unsafe to others; in culture, a threat to society.   <br /> <br />In my opinion the book asks us to think about these questions and answers.  Perhaps it gives us its answers but, more importantly, it is to us to think of them.  When is existentialism nihilism, and when is nihilism `wrong' and what should, if anything, society do about it?  I personally found Mersualt 'strange' at the start, then uncaring about the ills of others, and finally a murderer, which, to me, is a horrid thing regardless of the philosophy that led him there.  I found him interesting, but I can not condone his actions.  However, I think the point is more that Camus gave us this extreme example as a demonstration, and I think that's what to walk away with. <br /> <br />Last, I loved and admired the way the first few sentences, which are brilliant, come back later to tie the entire book together.  A short, simply stated book extraordinarily well-handed tous as food for great thought. <br />	2004-08-03

My husband and I are getting little out of it -- literally, we're getting a little and not more.    It's so poorly written that, at times, the grammar makes the meaning of sentences ambiguous. This becomes irritating; we're not only trying to learn to improve our games, but we have to figure out what Silman is trying to write.    The chapters are short and, in my opinion, incomplete. There are many chapters in this book; it covers a lot of material but in minimal ways, sometimes to the point of - huh? - then the chapter is over. Or, for example, the end-game chapter: it shows a couple ways a game can end--this piece and that piece, these three pieces or those three pieces--very specific pre-planned & diagrammed examples of only a few different endgames and that's it; that's the whole chapter.    Silman's &quot;What would you do if...?&quot; examples are under-explained and no alternatives given. As well, I find it difficult that a diagram and the start of notation are often on one page, and the rest of the notation is on the next page; I need to go back and forth between pages to see diagram, notation, diagram, notation.     Others have pointed out that many examples of games in the book are Silman games (Silman-won games). I, too, would have preferred to see other players' games, given the approach of showing tournament games.    It comes down to this: we've read it; we learned a few new ways of thinking, after deliberating what Silman meant when he wrote [x], but the book's high points are few and far betewen and the writing style is annoying.	2004-08-01

If the last time you read 'Lolita' you were under 21, remember it as a book about an older man and a teenage girl, or have since read more literature, I can't insist enough that you reread this book.    'Lolita':  bends genre, plays with words -- puns, references to Americana, cultural word jokes (\\"We had breakfast in the township of Soda, pop. 1001.\\"), character-name jokes, bilingual puns (\\"...'comme le lac est beau car il faut qu'il t'y mene.' Lucky beau! Qu'il t'y  -- what a tongue twister!\\")  Remember the character, Quilty? If not, reread, oh please do!     I picked it up because I hadn't received a new book, so I figured I'd reread an old one. I was so in awe after I finished I was unable to start another novel. I was unable Get Over It, like a love affair just completed; I couldn't move on, couldn't stop going back to passages I'd marked. (Update 7/22/05: Since re-reading 'Lolita' I've bought nearly all Nobokov's books, read books by influences, read about him, etc; I took an interest and found genius.)     My guess is that the genre-bending and perfectly-executed prurience at its start causes people to misunderstand 'Lolita', have certain expectations (set up by Nabokov, yes), or to recall it incorrectly.  The reader who thinks this is merely a story of an older man taking a young girl is greatly missing out on its intricacies.	2004-07-30

I'm a liar, so it could be that I did like the book or I liked it a little. I'm an admitted liar, which isn't the same as being a liar because I'm telling you I'm a liar: my statement that I didn't like the book, therefore, is a metaphor for my true feelings about the book. I am an existential reader, floating freely above the inauthentic written word, alongside Sartre, nuns who frolic in the snow, and ant corpses, reading each word with a grain of salt and another of pepper.   If I were to tell you my factual opinion of this book, by definition, it couldn't be fully truthful since I have already told you I'm a liar, and how can a liar state her feelings in a way that is anything but metaphorical? This review is a combination of fabrications, metaphors, and truths. Fabrications are really the same as facts, as they are metaphors for truths, so I refuse to tell you which details of this review are facts and which aren't. This is a book review, which is non-fiction; I insist vehemently, clearly smelling cinnamon and freshly-baked bread, that you, reader, accept this review as the truth. Metaphor is the only way I can tell you the truth, so it must be the truth, see? Deer eat from my birdfeeder as I write this; Blue Jays flap patiently, awaiting the deer's departure.  Parts of this review are absolutely accurate and other sentences are flatly false; false, a word I smell as foul flowers and the wafted odor of the garbage dump down the road (or maybe it's a few miles away).  However false, the preceding sentences are metaphors for my real opinion.    This, reader, is the truth: the way you responded to the above paragraph is how you will feel about the book. Remember, this is only my opinion and I am a slippery person.     P.S. I dislike liars.	2004-07-29

Psychological understanding undermines the 'reality' of a disease.'<br /><br /> Sontag traces, historically, the ways different diseases and the people who contracted them have been viewed. She spends time discussing tuberculars--waif-like, pale, romantic--and cancer patients--repressed, the 'cancer personality,' shame--then goes on to debunk these notions by stating that once the cause, cure, innoculation is found, the 'myth' or popular psychology of the disease no longer holds.<br /><br /> In this edition, in the final chapter about AIDS and its metaphors Sontag writes that she'd written the first part of the book (all but the AIDS chapter) while a cancer patient and in response to reactions she saw in fellow patients. She saw guilt and shame; and she saw these as impediments to people's treatments. For she knew she had an illness and she set about to cure it medically, in the best possible way, while others passively accepted the 'metaphor' handed to them and, thus, did less to help themselves best. She felt frustrated or saddened by their psychologizing and self-blame and wished to write to others that their physical illness is a physical illness and the best route to recovery is to think only of how to find the best medical treatment.<br /><br /> And she wrote this by demonstrating the history of myths that surrounded illnesses and the way these myths evaporated as soon as its true mechanism (the virus, or otherwise) was found.<br /><br /> Some holes in her argument can be found in the field of Health Psychology, which has proved that optimism generates faster post-operative recovery or a heartier immune system, among other 'psychological' correlates of disease to illness. Still we speak of a &quot;type A&quot; personality and a possibility of a heart attack, etc., which I believe is not entirely unfounded -- stress creates a drop in immune response and other health deficiencies.<br /><br /> However, I am a patient and a former psychotherapist. I was reared in psychology as others are toward priesthood. I grew up sent to therapists for any ills and was raised with the thought I be nothing but a therapist when an adult -- which I did become. Then I became diabled, from physical injury. My own disability is largely pain-related; the pain is severe and in locations that make it impossible to function. Much of my injury does not show up on contemporary tests -- EMG's, CAT scans, MRI's, bone scans, sonograms.<br /><br /> So I turn to psychology. I know I've got a physical injury. But if it can not be cured (and I go back to my original quote: that which is least understood, we psychologize), perhaps I am, in part, a cause of it. This had been a comforting notion to me: if I can do this to myeslf, I can also undo it. For me, psychologizing helped put me in the driver's seat.<br /><br /> Sontag at first put me in the driver's seat in a new, determined, knowing way. I know my injury is not something that is &quot;in my head.&quot; At first, Sontag's argument was a weight off my shoulders, an eye-opener. I underlined the passage above: yes, that's right; they don't know what's wrong with me so they blame me. A doctor once said to me: &quot;When I can't find anything wrong with someone I assume there is nothing wrong with her.&quot;<br /><br /> Sontag set me in motion. She went into motion, knowing cancer wasn't a word to whisper (remember when we whispered that 'c' word?), but something to pursue with a vengeance. Her book was liberating. I know I don't want to be sick, unable to do the things I want to, regardless ofhow neatly one can analyze my personality and show otherwise. This is physical.<br /><br /> Then reality. I've got sometihng and it isn't curable and it is debilitating. I am in doctors' offices all the time; fighting beaurocracy all the time. I wanted my psychologizing back. My security blanket had been removed with this &quot;epiphany&quot; of sorts. If it's not in my head, and I can't cure myself, and doctos can't cure me, I'm incurable. Her philosophy, then, became saddening.<br /><br /> I began to analyze her: perhaps she recovered so well because of her strong personality, her [psychological] strength. It's a chicken/egg question.<br /><br /> Sontag writes things that are clear and other things that can be argued. Overall, her essays have changed societal thought -- from Against Interpretation to On Photography to Illness as Metaphor and various others; she is brilliant and a powerfully good writer. Anyone who can make us look at something in a new way, make us think something through in a new way, is easily well-worth reading.<br /><br /> Anyone who is ill, particularly chronically, undiagnosed or misunderstood should read this book.

The imagery is pure gothic, complete, for example, with torn wedding dresses and insects that arrive annually in such droves as to cover, in inches, the town; windows can not be seen in or out of, and one Lisbon sister reaches palm-deep onto the hood of a car to etch her initials through bugs.    The Lisbon house similarly decays gradually throughout, from groomed-lawn typical to unkempt corruption.  The girls are seen--through binoculars and such--scavenging for food, skeletal, the stench from the house is that of horribly sour breath; eventually the roof is in collapse, the lawn overgrown, a large oak tree dying from disease.    I describe these images because the party-line seems to be that this is a book about the juxtaposition of outwardly 'normal' suburbia with its dark side.  I felt only its morbidity and none of its manicure.  The boys, 'we,' are in love with the imprisoned-at-home Lisbon girls. We're fascinated by Lux Lisbon until the very end, even now as seemingly middle-aged male narrators, we fantasize about this girl whom no woman ever will measure up to -- in all her skeletal 80-pound, slutty deathliness.    The girls' parents don't let them out, so we spy on the from outside or hear stories others tell of them (but for the twice we meet them in the flesh). We are obsessed with, fascinated by, and driven to be with and save the girls who we think are sexy, but I as the reader thought--and particularly by the end--creepy.  I felt as though I had bugs crawling on me.  I felt trapped and stuck and suffocated and looming death.  I didn't laugh, though; I like dark humor, but for me it wasn't in this book.    The writing itself is only a glimmer of the genius to come in Eugenides's MIDDLESEX.  Middlesex is brilliant.  This is well-executed, internally consistent, its imagery on target, its pacing correct.  Its literary scope is tiny compared to that of Middlesex.  This is a dark, gothic, short book and a fast read.  As quickly as I threw it on the bed after finishing, because I felt creepy, I've lost the feeling.  It doesn't haunt or stick; it's closer to literary pulp, if such a thing existed, than to anything else.	2004-07-26

It is plot-driven (a mystery novel of sorts), a fine character study, and a page-turner; I couldn't put it down.   <br />   It's a book within a book: The plot is an autistic boy writing a mystery novel. Within the novel, his life is interwoven. Christopher, the narrator, can not &quot;imagine&quot; what can not be, as he says, and can write only what he knows and experiences. So within his book we get his life, as well as his teacher's comments about this very book we're reading. As well, we feel his relationship to her -- all well done. Each character -- Christopher, his teacher and each of his parents are all very well-drawn characters (a marvelous narrative feat given the confines of Christopher's emotional abilities).   <br />   While I wouldn't go as far as to use the word heartbreaking, I would say I truly felt for Christopher. I was with him. I understood him. My heart raced, and I laughed.   <br />   Another reviewer wrote that this book accomplished something Steve Martin attempted to in &quot;The Pleasure of My Company.&quot; I thought that was quite an astute and accurate comment.    <br />   The book is not perfect, but extremely entertaining, and a great look into this boy's interesting mind. Through him, without his knowing, the reader understands others' responses to him.    <br />   There are some things that Christopher, the character, wrote that I am still thinking about while reading a different book. His thoughts were that interesting to me. There is one particular diagetic break in 'realism' with respect to his autistic way of thinking that I wish weren't there, as the book is otherwise internally consistent and beautifully realistic. (It's a novel, not science.)   <br />   Aside: I, too, as another reviewer wrote, have worked with autistic children. I can't say I knew any like Christopher but I do see from where this book comes. Haddon, as well, as his bio states, worked with autistic children. So - it's well-informed. I recommend!	2004-07-23

We can see the ways Freud was a &quot;poor&quot; therapist.  Some of his treatment styles would now be considered, at best, amoral; at worst, illegal.  But he is essential to the foundation of psychotherapy.  Without his theories (and opponents), we wouldn't have it at all.  He is a fascinating, great scientist and innovator.  His focus, also, is borne of its time, Victorian, and many of his theories predicated on from where *he* comes and what he saw in his patients - repression, for example.<br />Definitely read, if interested, Freud's description of his theories - his theories of both psychology and treatment.<br />But the case studies are imperative.  You can read all about Oedipus or dreams or the Id, but you won't SEE what he did, the analyst he was, until you read a case study.  Anna O., Dora, Emmy - any of them.  It's nearly mandatory to see Fread-at-work in order to understand *his* implementation of his thoughts.<br />I don't suggest you put out of your mind, if you have them, negative thoughts of Freud, his life, or his treatment styles, but to place him in history.  In my opinion he is the Daddy of them all.  I am not a Freudian, but I am in love with Freud.  I think he made egregious errors in his treatment of patients and, today, untried methods wouldn't be revered, or even implemented at all, this way.  We also wouldn't know they are &quot;errors&quot; if not for books like this.  But this is it, in its raw form, and from his point of view - the way of Freud.  So, disagree, find him quixotic, a breaker of rules we take as a given (such as confidentiality), but read the case studies.<br />Without the case studies, you've got theory and description but not the action, the meat of his treatment.  Plus, it's great reading.  It's not like plodding through a book you think you should read - it's short and it's &quot;simple,&quot; yet not simplistic; it's full of what he did.  Him in action.  An analysis of Freud, as much as of Dora.	2004-06-08

Even his grammar is fairly poor.  It's clear he's a visual person/artist - not just because he drew some of the scenes and people in the book, but the descriptions, too, are vibrant with great visual detail.<br />I'm avoiding the inevitable - fairly bad book.  I agree with much of the reviews.  It's an homage, dedicated to River Pheonix (a rather roundabout dedication that I know is one only because I read it is, and the word &quot;river&quot; is in the verse), that references perhaps a number of the young men Van Sant works with or, perhaps predominantly, River and Keanu.  I couldn't help but think Affleck and Damon read this and preyed on the &quot;dirty old man&quot; to pitch their script; he does love friendships between two young men--something that plays so beautifully in his films, and so poorly with a fifty-something narrator who's part of the story.<br />In &quot;Pink&quot; the main character writes in the first person, but in the footnotes refers to himself as his name.  He's an infomercial maker in his 50's and not very successful.  He meets two young boys, Jack and Matt, and is intrigued by them.  They've got a secret.  &quot;Pink&quot; is their secret and I won't say what Pink is because we don't find out for most of the book.<br />One of the boys is eerily similar to the dead infomercial-spokesman/teen-idol, Felix.  Felix = River Pheonix.  He even died in the street outside a nightclub (Felix, that is) while his brother called 911; he is 23-years-old; and his complexion, described in amazing technicolor detail, River's.  We've got lots of detail about Felix here and, as someone else wrote, how much of that is non-fiction?  Ouch.  I've read, too, about Van Sant's attraction to River Pheonix during the shooting of &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; - a film I adore to the pont of speechlessness (and I admit I'd found this attraction sort of hot) but, while oh-so-romanticon screen and so beautiful to watch, this book reads too uncomfortably like the journal of the &quot;dirty old man.&quot;<br />I didn't care for the footnotes thing - they served to slow the book down for me - the print is tiny and the information in them pertinent to the story - i.e., not footnote material.  I enjoyed the drawings; they looked to me like a storyboard, as it's not hard to remember who's writing this book.<br />But, it misses the mark.  Ah, if the narrator had been younger... okay, I won't start editing.  Wonderful, amazing director.  Not such a good author.  If it's a love letter of sorts, or a memoir, or journal entry to the memory of a lost friend, I appreciate that very much and, actually, I find the book's redemption in that notion.  I love Van Sant's filmmaking and artistic sensibility so much that, perhaps, I have the need to think this was something he needed to get off his chest - as well, I've read this is an homage to his loss of River Pheonix.  But, it really is different in concept than to experience.<br />If you don't have an interest in him, don't believe the &quot;similar to Vonnegut&quot; or other statements on the book jacket.  It isn't.  If you're an auterist, and want to see it, do - it's not wretched, but disappointing coming from this artist.	2004-05-28
US	45768757	R2M6UNHJA4IA6E	0151006431	510121269	Elvis in the Morning	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Interesting book & it worked for me	Overall, I truly enjoyed this boy-meets-pop-idol story.  I, oddly, find this an interesting topic, and did long before this book.  Here, a teenager meets Elvis Presley and becomes Elvis's friend.  It's a rock and roll fantasy.<br />In this book, Orson is our Elvis fan who becomes the King's most trusted confidante.  Their friendship spans 15 years and, for me, worked better for, approximately, the first half of the book than the latter.  By the end of the book, which is very much about Elvis Presley--the real guy--it's hard to keep the focus on Orson while knowing, feeling, awaiting Elvis's fate. And I don't think Buckley pulled this element off; the real Elvis overshadowed the literary fantasy of their relationship.<br />Orson is a well-fleshed-out character, and he has a life and a wife who is also a solid, full character; they've got their own story and lives that work and are interesting.  I would have enjoyed reading even more about them.<br />But, when we are in the 1970's (chapters are titled by date and place), it became, for me, nearly impossible not to dread and anticipate what would become of Elvis.  Chapter headings 1971, '72, '73, etc. - I was thinking to myself: Elvis is going to be dead in five years; Elvis is going to die in four years...  Elvis Presley is such a looming figure, and his real life well described in this book, that my focus--and the book's, to a great extent--became Elvis rather than Orson.  <br />What began as boy-meets-hero turned into story of Elvis.  And at that point, the fantasy element got lost in the largeness of Elvis Presley.  This, then, created other flaws for me. Buckley went to great lengths to tell us Elvis's real life.  Elvis's relationship with Orson, then, by the end, was nearly superfluous and, therfore, more \\"not-believable\\" than it was fantasy.  Similarly for Priscilla's (and Lisa Marie's and others') relationships with both Orson and Orson's wife.  Orson had become part of a real life that was vividly described, and the book beame so much about Elvis, that Orson got lost, as did the hero-fantasy (as well, Orson is now an adult with a very real Elvis Presley considering him the only person he can trust -- their friendship took on a far-fetched feel).<br />All that said, I liked it very much.  I liked the beginning for the hero-fantasy, and I liked the latter part for the Elvis story.  What I liked in the end is not, I think, what the book was \\"about,\\" but what I took from it - what a sad, sad story, Elvis Presley.  By then, I didn't need Orson - the book had become about Elvis Presley.	2004-05-22

Yes, I agree with the previous reviewer that this is a collectible, and not the version of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; to buy in order to read.  But I am one of the Gatsby and Fitzerald junkies who wanted this, badly, the moment I heard it was going to be released.<br />It is, though, even if you do want to read it, so fragile (the material its pages are made of) and unwieldy that it's nearly frightening - I may destroy it, is the feeling I have each time I look at it.<br />As for the substance: the book went through a number of changes, and this respresents one.  So, it isn't an all-encompassing view of the progression of the writing of the book - it's one set of corrections.  The fascination, for me, is with Fitzgerald's handwriting, markings, and marginalia. I do have an affinity for handwriting, and for Fitzgerald, so this is interesting to me.  Less interesting is that these are corrected galleys, really, because I know of other versions (read, even, the book &quot;Trimalchio: an early edition of The Great Gatsby&quot;) and, even after these particular galleys were proofed, FSF sent telegrams to his editor requesting further change - most notably, the title, which didn't get changed as the book had already gone to print.<br />Nevertheless, owning this is a piece of FSF history and I love it.  I like less reading it than looking at it, but that's me.  I wouldn't do without it, and if I got more of them for my birthday I'd be in heaven!!<br />The series is numbered, and I wish I had a lower number. (It took me a little while to bring myself to spend the money.)  For this reason, when it came from Amazon in a box too small for it, with no packaging material, and the corners of _its_ box pressed in, I didn't return it for a clean copy.  But I do wish more care had been taken in the packaging of this item.  It's that important to me.	2004-04-14

It also has useful information about the history of the language, the Roman calendar, etc., though not in incredible detail.  Because of its size and ease of use, it's the first Latin book I grab when I want to learn or remember Latin syntax.  I end up skimming through, invariably, because the book makes it easy and interesting to do so.  It's compact, useful, well-formatted, and comfortable to use.  Know that it isn't a dictionary; for that, you'd need to go elsewhere. (I'm not a Classics scholar - just a former Latin student who's still interested, occasionally active, and someone who always wants to learn and practice more... if I had the time.)	2004-03-13

She tells us, in the first sentence, she is alone on the earth (&quot;At the beginning I left notes.&quot;)  For me, there was a driving force to the plot - is this woman really alone, and to what extent?  Is she alone in her house, holed up from trauma, or alone in her mind, &quot;mad,&quot; as she phrases it - though she claims she has had periods of madness, not that she *is* mad.  I found this plot elemnt a mystery, and I was driven, as such, to find out the ending or &quot;truth.&quot;<br />The other element of the book is the substance itself, what she writes--thinks about--and the way she writes it.  This, I think, is where a reader can become tired (I saw reviews say it should have been shorter, though this is quite a short book) or wander from the material.<br />The narrator talks a lot about ancient Greece, mythology, classical music, and limited-in-scope literature and art.  Her focus is on &quot;high art,&quot; or certain pieces of, but not all readers will be interested enough in Helen of Troy or in Brahms to find her musings compelling. They can be at odds with the other compelling part, the plot.<br />So, I think Markson has, in some way, two books.  One is his plot/philosophical-novel and the other is the monologue of Kate, the narrator.  I, too, perked up at times she did things near the beach house she lives - go for water, explore a neighboring house - and though I was/am interested in Helen, mythology, and literature, her musings were both limited in scope and each topic disproportionately covered.  This would happen if any person's inner thoughts were put to paper - I may find Helen interesting, but classical music not so interesting.<br />Where I think the novel fails to keep the interest of readers is in the disparity between her life (Markson's philosophical demonstration) and her personal interests.<br />That said, for all my lack of interest in Brahms, et. al., there was an inevitable connection to her world - were there one or two copies of the book about Brahms? Did she burn one in a fire? Did she read it? Was it a children's book?<br />I was riveted.  I too skimmed parts, as others said, as there was just so much about topics not of interest to me.  But, no sooner did I begin to skim, than I was reeled back in.  The book is fascinating.  Its execution nearly brilliant.  If I may nit-pick, Markson's excessive use of the word &quot;doubtless&quot; drove me nuts. In character or not, it was too much, to the point of distraction and detraction.<br />Last, I'll repeat what others have, the structure of each page, paragraph and sentence was wonderful.  One-, two-sentence paragraphs, tangents of thought and reversal of thought, and her unreliable narration - contradiction of earlier things said, etc.<br />I found the end heartbreaking, and reread the last line a few times to be sure of my interpretation what I'd read.  It was fully unexpected; it didn't read as the jolt I'd expected but, upon thought, it was one.<br />Riveting.

I'd love to read stories the way she used to write them, but they're not in here.<br />I heard Ms. Homes say at a reading that &quot;Things You Should Know&quot; was conceived to contain stories that all involve &quot;shape-shifting&quot; of some sort.  The stories don't display her talent; they're boring. They're pretty bad, really.  It reads as though she's coasting, now that she's become as famous as she is.  I don't think anyone without a &quot;name&quot; would have got this book published.  One of the stories, btw, is on the Nerve website, so you can have a free look.<br />She's uneven, I think. I used to refer to A.M. Homes as my favorite contemporary author.  Now, I find her to be ubiquitous and mediocre.  This book is perfect example of her mediocre writing.  Ms. Homes, though, is marvellously talented.  Read &quot;Music For Torching&quot; (my favorite) instead, if you haven't.  Or &quot;The Saftey of Objects&quot; (my own 2nd favorite) or even &quot;Jack.&quot;  &quot;In a Country of Mothers&quot; is also easy to skip - her first (I'm pretty sure) and predictable from right near the beginning.<br />If you've not read Ms. Homes's work, I would definitely not start here.  If you're a fan - go for it.  I know I'll keep reading what she writes and keep watching her read - though it is becoming tiresome.<br />As an aside: she's rather unfriendly and pompous in person, a busy-looking-for-better-people-to-talk-to type.  But, that's her prerogative.  She's earned the right.	2004-02-18
US	45768757	R1154R6UBR3WNK	0743235355	730119057	Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles	Books	3	1	3	N	Y	Good but not good enough	-<br />My overall sense is that Anthony Swofford wasn't ready to write this book.  <br />He writes that he had put the war out of his mind, and the people he knew from war out of his life, until 8 years later he came upon artifacts and reminders.  At that point he revisits his experience emotionally and, in preparing to write the book, researches facts.<br />Putting a traumatic event out of one's mind for a period of time as a way to remain sane is common and valid.  Revisiting it, to be whole or complete or to become more \\"sane,\\" is valid and common too.  However, in making the decision to write a book at that time, what Swofford did not have at his disposal were his [missing] 8 years of memories.  He didn't first feel and re-examine, think about and conclude, then tell his story.  These omissions of self-examination were too blatant throughout the book, a book of self-examination.<br />The story he told, though, is written as if he does have the decade-later perspective (he tells us that his memoir is from this hindsight).  But, he doesn't, having spent the decade shutting out the experience.  The result, therefore, is not a grown man writing about 10 years ago, but a man still in the throes of a similar confusion or way of thinking as he was during the war.  This is evidenced, very simply, by his use of language.  Swofford is now an adult, a writer, a teacher, yet the vocabulary of the narration switches erratically between adult (i.e. \\"correct\\") usage and \\"grunt,\\" \\"jarhead\\" jargon.  I'm talking about the narrative style of his current perspective, not his description *of* the 18-year-olds in the Desert.  <br />So, he is not 18 yet he also does not quite have the distance to tell the story he set out to tell - his perspective today.  Valid, as he didn't revisit his story for many years.  Psychologically valid, but missing in important detail for the reader, details not yet uncovered, perhaps, by Swofford himself.<br />I did not find this to be the horrific or gruesome story others did.  I was not surprised that 17- and 18-year-olds behave like 17- and 18-year-olds.  I was dismayed, as another reviewer wrote, that his mates were indistinguishable from one another.  All but one or two blend together as a mass of fellow \\"jarheads\\" without personality.  To him they are individuals he feels deeply for, he tells us (and he dedicates the book to them), but he doesn't show them to us.<br />Sometimes Swofford tells us his emotions and sometimes he doesn't.  My complaint here is not that the story-telling is uneven but that I read the book because I wanted to read a memoir - one man's experience.  His emotional experience and his actual experience.<br />At times, in the book, we've got detail of actual events, without Swofford's emotional reaction to it.  Sometimes they are details of dates or activity, and sometimes these details take up many pages.  I wanted more from *him* - his _memoir_.  I wanted more about him, and *his* experiences.  <br />But, I don't think the author himself has fully uncovered them, as they'd been buried many years before he tackled this very tough thing.  This is not his fault; the fact that he wrote the book before he was ready is.  Writing the book, itself, may have been cathartic and eye-opening for the author and, as much as I did learn, he just didn't write enough substance.  I didn't *see* the desert; I didn't *see* the other men (but for a couple of exceptions); I didn't feel his feelings.<br />That said, I know more than I did before I read the book, and I'm not sorry I did.  It was worthwhile, but had someone told me of a more \\"complete\\" Gulf War memoir to read, I would have chosen the other.<br />Also, I don't want to be fully critical.  Swofford wrote, quite honestly, about personal things.  <br />It's the things omitted that this book lacks.  Regarding the adult, time-past perspective: I would rather have seen either, 1. an acknowledgement that there's a gap in his knowledge, and fully professional writing, or 2. the \\"jarhead\\"-style writing that comes and goes throughout the book be the consistent/only style.  The book goes back and forth haphazardly, teen to adult writer, and my own conclusion is that this is where Swofford is, psychologically, with the material.  It's not great writing, but it tells a story - be it not the full story of Swofford I'd hoped it would.  I want to hear from a guy who experienced the Gulf War and I want to hear all about it; to me, he had the guts to write it... but not quite.<br />I do, though, have to give Swofford kudos for his bravery and for telling us what he did.  I do appreciate it, and I did learn from him.	2004-01-20

I use this far more often than the Chicago Manual of Style or Strunk and White.  It's small, well-organized, and has it all (most of it all, anyway).<br />I write fiction, and this guide works wonderfully anyway; I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a fiction writer.  Sometimes--but only rarely--entries don't apply to fiction writing, or the rules differ.<br />The manual is organized alphabetically, not just by subject, but the entire book is alphabetical.  This makes it *so* much easier to find what I'm looking for than the other reference guides.  <BR>E.g.: Do titles of books go in quotes?   Look up \\"book\\" and the answer is there.  If the answer isn't there, this manual anticipates what you may be looking for and tells you:  for titles, see \\"title.\\"  If you look up the word, \\"quote,\\" it will tell you how to use quotation marks (not 2nd grade information, but every permutation of those gnawing things you just aren't quite sure about when writing a professional cover letter or a story).  And again, it can anticipate what was left out of the \\"quote\\" entry and send you elsewhere.  <br />It's a keyword book, organized alphabetically, beginning to end.  It *is* the glossary, in a sense, but the glossary doesn't send you to a wordy, where's-what-I-want chapter; the info is succintly at hand.  No need to spend any amount of time searching for your question, or answer; it's there for you, as is the reason for the usage.

I won't describe her work (other reviewers have, and if you're here you're at least familiar), but say that if you've loved any poetry by Sexton, I highly recommend this book.<br />It's organized, chronologically, by her books (and hence her life): each poem from each book is within this one, plus some previously unpublished poems.  Each of her books--in this case, chapters--is thematically consistent: fairy tales (Sexton-style \\"homages\\"), \\"love poems,\\" time in the institution, etc.<br />You may not love every book/chapter, but the volume is a must-own.  I don't see a need to buy \\"Love Poems,\\" for example, or all or some of the rest of her books, when they're all in here - and each one not priced all that differently from this entirety.  (It's also not oppressively long and hard to hold like some \\"complete\\" collections.) <br />Within this book, if you don't connect to one, two, or any of her other books, you've got them at hand and while enjoying the material you do--be it institution or masturbation--you'll be familiar with the rest.<br />Anne Sexton is my favorite poet, I admit, but when I reread a poem I far more often pick up this volume than the individual books.  <br />As well, the chronological organization of \\"Complete Poems\\" tells a story itself - Sexton's life through her confessional poetry.  It becomes a memoir, of sorts.  While reading, you can easily see the year of each book's/chapter's publication.  And in this way, the volume becomes a story and a biography.	2004-01-13
US	45768757	R33BPUAEAUXT78	1888889160	668487554	Her Father: A Memoir	Books	3	0	1	N	Y	Disappointing	I wanted, very much, to get to know Bill Henderson, the man behind The Pushcart Prize and Pushcart Press. He has no web site and he's criticized by the publishing industry as someone who came from nowhere and awards prizes that are, for no reason, revered.<br />So, who is he?  How did he come to be who he is?<br />Of his few memoirs published, each by his own press, this seemed most informative.  But, it wasn't informative enough.  It begins as a good memoir - a bit about his feelings, his past, his promise to his mother, which, as other reviews point out is the thesis of the book.<br />From that point on, this promise--to have a child--takes over, to the point of the book becoming not a memoir but a letter to his daughter, or, a year in the life of.  He could have, perhaps, been helped by an objective editor (i.e., not the mom).  Nine months of pregnancy does not half a memoir make.<br />I read the book and I know Mr. Henderson a bit better, which is nice.  I wanted more than a bit, and I wanted more than a story of pregnancy.  <br />His personal story, and seemingly the book, ends with him as a poor self-publisher.  This begs the comment:  No he isn't.  He publishes one of the most sought-after prizes for small presses; he makes careers; his Pushcart Prize is an It Prize.  He can't possibly be a poor guy in a shack.  <br />When the story of his career stopped and the one of his fatherhood began, he forgot to mention what happened next in the rest of his life.  I want to know what happened next, and I don't really want to read all four of his memoirs to find out.<br />Ultimately, I think that had he not been the publisher, this book would not have been published.  As the title implies, it's about being \\"her father\\"; it's a note to his daughter.  And, it's two books in one - the first half, a memoir; the second half, a pregnancy and child.	2003-12-16

I skipped around to the ones that interested me, meaning I didn't feel like reading all of them.    I've got an advanced degree in psychology; I understand from where this book comes and I thought it was just fine.  Smart, worth looking at, but not as \\"nothing else like this\\" as the reviews seem to indicate.     Worth mentioning: Phillips is a child psychologist and his anecdotes, from his own practice, are about children.    Four stars for intelligence.	2003-12-09

Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald	Books	3	18	23	N	Y	Mediocre	I'm fascinated by Fitzgerald and was truly looking forward to reading this book, what I thought would be an exchange between F. Scott and Zelda, as its title indicates.<br />But, the book is almost entirely Zelda's writing.  Zelda didn't keep many of Scott's letters, so they aren't here, and apparently his letters to other people are found in other books - not that they \\"belong\\" here, necessarily, but I would have liked to hear from Scott himself.  For example, Zelda in the hospital: letters from Zelda to Scott are here.  Scott clearly is doing things during these periods - including writing letters to hospital staff *about* Zelda's treatment (these letters, I believe, are in Bruccoli's book, F. Scott Fitgerald's Life In Letters).<br />Much of Scott's thoughts, therefore, are left to the imagination.  He's in California at times; he's drinking; he's with their child.  Since this book is about their relationship as told through letters--i.e., their own words and thoughts--I wanted his too.<br />So, I found it rather one-sided and its title misleading.  Had I known I wasn't going to read a relationship in letters I may have had a different response.  It's absolutely interesting to read Zelda's thoughts and we certainly understand much of their situation through reading this book.  So, for what it is, it's interesting.  But, for what it purports to be, it's lacking.	2003-12-09

I'd enjoyed the short story, \\"The Obscure Object,\\" in The New Yorker that was less a chapter than a complete piece Eugenedies adapted from the book.  But I was told that the story was better than the book and that I'd read enough.<br />It was nagging at me, though, because I'd enjoyed his writing so much and I was curious about all the praise.  Then, after someone I respect loved the book, I bought it.<br />This is easily the BEST piece of contemporary fiction I have read in ages.  I am endlessly in search of something good to read and, way too often, bored.<br />This book is a gem.  His use of language, style, tense, vocabulary, plot structure - it's near perfection.  But don't get me wrong - it is an INTERESTING read! as well as an impeccably written novel.<br />The book is a journey that, when finished, I felt had come full circle.  It's a multple-generation story that culminates with the birth, and life, of the narrator.<br />The narrator, not yet born for most of the book, uses fabulous, unique techniques to show us how this family, and he, came to be who they are.  Eugenides's use of the past and present tense is remarkable.  He flawlessly uses a \\"tabbooed\\" technique--shifting between past and present tenses--with incredible results, from all perspectives: narrative, literary, and sheer reading pleasure, in order to unfold the book.<br />It's wonderful.  The story is wonderful, the characters are wonderful, but the writing makes it.  The writing is brilliant.  Brilliant (and entertaining too!) throughout.  Flawless.<br />It absolutely deserves the Pulizer Prize it won.	2003-12-09

First, I love Steve Martin and pre-ordered this book.  But, I'm surprised by all the reviews that call it hysterically funny.  It's sad.  The protagonist is sad; he suffers a mental illness that's making him miserable - it isn't funny. I don't mean that we can't laugh at misfortune (Steve Martin is GREAT at having us do so), but he misses the mark here. At times, less rather than more, there are genuinely funny lines (I did laugh a little).      Mostly, though, we--I include myself--enjoy it because it's Steve Martin and we're fans.  Otherwise, this really isn't a very good book. It isn't very funny and it doesn't have much to say (compare to \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in Nighttime\\" which, about an autistic character, is funny, interesting, entertaining, and heartbreaking).      \\"The Pleasure of My Company\\" reads as though it's trying too hard, and it reads as though it's shallow, which I fully believe SM is not.  Plus, the nature of OCD - obsessive, repetitive thoughts - the way they are presented here, in all their minutiae, makes for boring reading.  I even skimmed through some of this little novella. Essentially, we get the blow-by-blow of Pecan's thoughts, which are quite pitiful, written as though we should be laughing.     Spoiler:    I liked the redemptive, \\"Hollywood,\\" ending and unrealistic character growth and recovery.  I had a sense of completion, at least, though in this man's world it's pure fantasy.	2003-10-15

I am so glad I finally picked this up.  It's short and straight-forward, as books used to be, yet complex and beyond meaningful, as books at their best are.<br />It isn't hard reading, by any means, but it reveals a strong, strong lesson played out through the friendship of two young boys, their complex relationship to one another and within their small world, their fathers' relationship to each another (and their worlds and thought processes), and how they are viewed--and view--their school and community.  All of this in such a tiny book - while nowadays books are 800 pages of nada (and I'm just in my 30's).<br />It's not a children's book and, while simple, it's far from simplistic.  The &quot;lesson&quot; or &quot;moral&quot; or journey of the two boys is life-altering for them, and really, in its way, was for me too - because of how haunting it is, how direct its story, how the plot is the thing.  We're handed the message, easily, on a platter - and that is all that's needed.<br />The levels of complexity are within these peoples' worlds, not wordplay or fancy writing.  It's the/their real world - a world full of those who don't fit in where they &quot;should,&quot; those trying to find their own ways, being judged by others, and pressured by their own.<br />Some of the themes are universal; the world in which these two live isn't.  Their world is specific and small, and has to be for this story; yet, for anyone interested in this particular  world--the multifacets of Judaism and its sects at some of the highest, most historic or profound, levels--the book is a history lesson.  It isn't a boring history lesson but one told through the eyes of two boys finding their ways through their respective cultures and into the world.  Do people [does a person] want to be the part of the world laid out for them and what is involved in leaving it?  This question applies to everyone.<br />It's mainly their relationship to each other that reveals the information.  Two boys talk and teach one another; people love and resent; one boy is uniquely pressured, the other more free.  This is a book about Jewish history, about friendship, about personal choice, and the road to independent thought.<br />The thing that makes a character a brilliant talmudic scholar is the same character trait that makes him an independent thinker who questions the path set out for him and his duty to fulfill it.  His duty and his feelings are at odds; he is a young boy and his struggles are moral, intellectual, historic, and human.  His conversations with his friend are profound and eye opening, both for the characters and the reader.<br />Conversation and human interaction dominate a book that is predominantly a journey of thought.  It's lovely.  This approach leads us to feel not only for the characters but for their relationships - the boys' to one another and each to his and the other's father, as well as the bonds formed with &quot;minor&quot; characters.<br />From the first chapter, I was hooked.  It begins with an edge-of-your-seat baseball game.  I couldn't be less interested in baseball, but there was something going on here, a nail biter, a bring-us-in chapter that brought us into a world so complicated yet, again, written and shown to us so easily.  Piecemeal, in a way - from the game to the hospital, other characters in the ward, then to their outside-the-hospital world that is the rest of the book.<br />It's a must read, truly.  It is a must-read for Jews (I am Jewish) but also universal in theme, and an insight into particular elements of Judaism. I'd recommend it to absolutely anyone.<br />It's taken me a long time to write the review since finishing the book, as I didn't even know where to start.  But, The Chosen is with me in the same way as the day I put it down, and as I hope it will always be.  I hope not to forget.  I hope no one does.	2003-10-03

The authors aren't stupid; it's not poorly written, nor boring.  Well, okay, it does get boring after 100 pages or so of the same thing.  300 pages = too much.  <br />I'm a New Yorker and the references are familiar and were fun at the start.  The revenge factor was, in its evil way, fun too.  Then I started to feel sorry for the real children whose nannies these were, who will one day read this.  Also, just me - I like a book at least to say something about something, even if it is breezy reading.<br />Take this one to the beach, or wherever, and space out - you'll finish in a couple of days and be no different for the experience... just perhaps able to recognize a greater amount of expensive brand names.	2003-08-14

My experiences during and after (the hospital, police, life) were far different from Alice Sebold's.  The thing I liked least about this book were her generalizations to all rape victims, or survivors if you choose.  She writes sentences such as, \\"When you're a rape victim you become a celebrity,\\" referring to all on her college campus who knew of her rape.  The sentences she writes in the second person, \\"When you're raped...\\" are simply her experience.  She presupposes we all had her experience.  I didn't become a celebrity; I was not treated by the police nor the hospital any way close to how she was; and, my life that followed differed very much from hers.<br />However, the passages in the book--however brief--that did describe emotions I feel or felt were powerful for me.  I reread a couple of paragraphs as I was reading, just to see again - someone else knows *this* feeling, has *this exact* feeling.  Some of the sameness of emotion made me feel connected.  Most of our emotions, reactions, and actions--and those of the people around us--were very different.  I feel resentful when I read or hear people speak of rape victims (and perpetrators) in finite and discrete categories of human behavior.  Choice, too, is huge - many of us didn't have the opportunity even to pursue a criminal case.  Many victims don't have supportive families or friends.  She was indeed lucky in many ways.<br />While this is one woman's story, and I respect it as that, it is written as a more universal story than it is.  I am not like Alice Sebold.  We were raped at a similar age and are close in age now, yet we are very different.  This is one book for/about a rape victim, but it's a memoir and not a guide.  If every sentence that she wrote in the second person, or that purported to generalize her situation to others', were changed to be simply in memoir format, the book would be greatly improved.<br />As well, but less important, I was unimpressed by her writing skills to the point of distraction.  Nevertheless, the read is fast and easy, and the book not overly long.<br />Take a look - it's a glimpse into one woman's experience; but, for the sake of the rest of us, don't take it as gospel.	2003-07-14

Each sentence is a work of art and a pleasure to read.  I smile as I read.  The stories themselves are so clearly placed in a post-WWI setting that they are a glimpse into life in the 1920's - as, I believe, Fitgerald wanted to show.  Also, to me, any Fitgerald work edited or or explained by Matthew Bruccoli is informative & interesting.    The above, though, is to those who like Fitzgerald.  To me, his is special beyond many other authors' writing.  If you've never enjoyed his work before, this book won't change that.  If you've never read anything by Fitzgerald, I would suggest starting with \\"The Great Gatsby.\\"	2003-07-13

This early version is absoultutely fascinating to me.  I've read much about the history of the manuscript and the changes made to it, and with \\"Trimalchio\\" we get to read for ourselves one version.  I was thrilled to have this unusual opportunity; I felt privileged.  (Only one complaint in this review is in my last paragraph.)    Aside from the sheer thrill of witnessing at least part of the transition and revision, the book itself is a wonder--to one end--to be viewed along with \\"The Great Gatsby.\\"  Things I've been bothered by in \\"Gatsby\\" are different in this book, and it's interesting to read that they had indeed been altered - most notably, the mid-section in \\"Gatsby\\" when Nick tells the reader in a near omnicient narration Gatsby's true story; this happens entirely differently in \\"Trimalchio\\" and in my opinion does not break the narrative flow the way it does in the final \\"Great Gatsby.\\"      Some unanswered questions, some debated items become clearer after reading this.  Is Gatsby a good guy or a bad guy?  Is Nick?  Who is Jordan Baker really?  Is Nick the agent of the action or an observant/removed narrator?  \\"Trimalchio\\" presents the answers to some of these questions differently than does \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" or in a more straightforward and clear fashion.  In a sense, this could be a truer-to-Fitzgerald's-soul account, as many of the changes were suggested to him from the outside.  Many of the characters underwent changes from this version to \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" though some changes more major than others.    I'm trying, in this review, not to write what would be a book's worth of my opinion about which is a superior book.  Gatsby is such a part of me I could write forever. I will mention that typos and other necessary changes were made from this to the final, as well.  And although some things I've questioned and have bothered me simply because I do love the book so much are different in this early version, I don'tknow how I'd feel if this were the *only* version of the book, as what we have here is an early version of a book I'd always thought brilliant.    The language is beautiful; the characters amazing, sad, complex.  I'm infinitely impressed by this book, whichever level of \\"completion.\\"      I've got one complaint about this edition of \\"Trimalchio\\":  at the back of the book, there is a list of changes made - galley version, holograph, 1st edition, etc.  They are laid out in such a way that they are hard to follow and hard to study.  I nearly know \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by heart.  While reading \\"Trimalchio\\" I noticed tiny, tiny differences.  But, after I finished, I wanted to truly study the changes at each stage of Fitzgerald's writing, and the lay-out and lack of explanation made it oppressively uninviting.  It's too bad, too, because I am ceaselessly (as FSF might say) interested in this - this book, the revision process, its history, everything Gatsby.	2003-06-07

It's almost a historical mandate for an understanding of the short story from the turn on the centrury onward.<br />That said, when do you choose to read him and which book?  If you haven't read O Henry, O Do.  But, I don't think that as many stories that are in this collection are necessary.  Once you see what he does, you've got it.  Once you see it, you can also then see what's happened since, and along the way - short stories of the 20s, 40s, 50s, etc., and to the present.  <br />Read a few O Henry stories if you've got an interest in reading short stories.  If you're short of money or time, you don't need quite as many as are in this book. Unless you are highly interested in O Henry, my sense is you won't read every story in this book anyway.  <br />Buy this book if you can't get enough of him and have that burning desire to see the ones left out of earlier anthologies.  Otherwise, pick up any O Henry book - they've got the &quot;important&quot; ones and that's all you need. This book, so many stories, is too repetitious after awhile; once you've read a few, you know how from the first paragraph how every story will end.

I love it.<br />I love the description of NY history and the details of it.  I'm from New York and, after reading some of the other reviews, I  see that the details were less interesting to other people. But, elements such as:  Trinity Church was the tallest building, City Hall was \\"uptown\\" (I love these!), The Statue of Liberty's head was visible but unassembled - I was lost in the scenery, what NY was like, and riveted by the history.<br />When I started to read the book, I thought Finney bit off way more than any book can chew:  a time-travel, love story, historical fiction, mystery all in one - ha, this guy is full of himself.  Then I kept reading.  He pulled it off famously.  I was taken in and absorbed, riveted.  New York then. The story - I was swept away.  The intrigue - a page turner.<br />I simply love this book.  I adore it.  I loved reading about this time period in NY, about places I know now, and with the story and style used.  Just wonderful.<br />Side note:  The first time I came across it I was a student and had a job at a restaurant called \\"Time and Again.\\"  The whole staff was reading it and passing it around to one another.  I'm a rebel and rejected the notion.  A bit later, I read it.  It stands as the book I always apologize for loving as much as I do, yet I come as close as I can to making everyone read it.  It's one of my favorite fairy tales, told with that terrific historical accuracy and detail.<br />I didn't care much for his other books, and I thought that the sequel to this was awful - but, oh, give this one a shot.  Particularly if you're a New Yorker.  It's just so entertaining!	2003-05-24

But, &quot;Best&quot; of 2002?  Of the (I think I recall correctly) 20 short stories, eight are from The New Yorker.  Perhaps The NYer prints many of the best short stories; in fact, they probably do - given their readership, pay scale, and authors they attract.  <br />However, if you want to read The new Yorker just buy The New Yorker.  If you want a variety of short stories from a variety of magazines, you won't find them in this book.<br />What you will find is a nice bibliography of all the magazines read by the editor and considered for publication in this touted series.  As a new author, this is good.  To me, it's a nice list of suggestions about where to submit stories.  Even though those stories probably won't make it to this series, the bibliography suggests a degree of clout.  I think this is important given how many magazines out there; the honed-down list can be useful.  (This isn't the only place to find such a thing, but it is a way to see which magazines the editors of this series consulted.)<br />Another book, the annual Pushcart Prize selection, works similarly.  The list of publications *they* used gives us a good lesson in small presses that aren't so small as to be ignored, yet too small to be viewed by _this_ series or a wide readership.  <br />Basically, I feel this is a book for writers more than for readers.  We learn what the editors are reading, where they are reading it, and what they are looking for.  If you are a reader looking for a short story collection, I'd say skip it - despite, I'm sure, the many hours of reading and thought put in by the editor.	2003-05-24

This book would have been riveting if an editor had the guts to tell Mr. Irving to cut it from 700 to 300 pages.  As it is now, it's overlong and, as such, too boring for its potential.      It's got the expected Irving motifs:  prostitutes, Vienna, sex, transsexuals, animals, and medical maladies.     Unfortunately, this book doesn't take place at the circus. The book is a \\"side show\\" of sorts, which I hate to say  because it's an insult to the real-life people described - dwarfs, an extra-large foot, etc.  True, these young characters either become prostitutes or, if they are lucky, are treated by the doctor-hero and join the circus.  Meaning, circus is mentioned but, ironically, the only thing not described.    Much of the information is superfluous, and to me, included in the book because it was of interest to John Irving.  Okay.  When I was a teenager I loved Garp and The Hotel New Hampshire, then the three earlier ones; and, as an adult I've liked some of the newer ones.      Now, in my 30's, though, I feel I'm reading the inner thoughts of a sex-obsessed teenager in an older man's body.  Every character, described in far more detail than the story warrants, has sex as an integral part of his life.  The setting has sex as in integral part of its life (we've got detailed descriptions of three different types of transsexuals, how they are perceived by each other and by their communities - the prostitution community and the community at-large).           The style of the narration is authoritative, stilted, and nearly academic - at odds with its material.  The sentences, too, are too long.  Commas, semi-colons, em-dashes.  He just rambles.    The story is told through omniscient narration, and in such great detail, that we've got not a \\"who done it\\"--a murder serves as a sort-of grounding point--but a \\"how will the characters learn.\\"  Since the reader knows who the killer is less than half-way through, and I didn't feel verymuch for the characters, this element was lost on me.     I read all of it because John Irving is in my soul, somehow.  Had this been the first one I'd read, and at this age, I probably would have stopped around page 100.  As it was, I had to take time out to read short stories between.  I also looked forward to its end; I was glancing at page numbers -- 400, 300, 200 pages in front of me that I knew would be more of the same didn't make for optimal reading.    Three stars for being John Irving.  For keeping me reading.  For my being in love with him since adolescence.  But, if you're looking for a first John Irving book to read, I wouldn't recommend this as a starting point.	2003-05-16

The subject matter, mainly insanity in some form or from some point of view or another, is handled very well.  Some stories are more intriguing than others and I'd say two of them stand out above and beyond the rest.  <br />I gave this book four rather than five stars because after awhile the writing becomes repititious and tedious.  While the book begins with stories that are very strong and original, an unfortunate droning quality starts to predominate.  <br />The stories are largely set in London and have a &quot;London feel,&quot; for better or worse.  The ones that are excellent are worth the price of admission.  The few stories that are gloomy and slow, while on their own might be fabulous, within this collection serve as filler.  I highly recommend it, though - the great stories are pure and unique enough to be life-changing.	2003-01-25
