I thought it was going to tell me about the contents of the Dead Sea Scrolls.  No, it isn't that kind of book.  I wouldn't have ordered it had I known what it was.<br /><br />It is more about the discovery of the scrolls, the caves, etc.<br /><br />So let this review be a warning to a prospective buyer.  If what you are interested in is simply to learn the stories contained in the scrolls, read some of the other reviews to find out where that information can best be found.  Not here.<br /><br />Anyone who gives this review a negative rating doesn't understand the process.  This review is exactly the kind of information I could have used before I bought the book.<br /><br />Get the right tool for the job.  If you need a Phillips head screwdriver get a Phillips head screwdriver.  If you are looking for a book that concentrates on the stories contained in the Dead Sea Scrolls, get one.

But I see it differently.  I believe that the single most important thing that this book has to contribute is its sections on the presidents of our distant past, the ones we know next to nothing about.  James Garfield, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, Benjamin Harrison.  This book actually brings them to life for us, and I think that is a very worthwhile contribution.  I don't need this book to tell me about recent presidents.<br /><br />The author has a glib and light style.  I don't trust his opinions about anything.  But I like the way he tells us what issues faced various presidents and how they handled them.<br /><br />The author writes like a prim spinster.  One of the main things he focuses on is when one of our presidents fails to keep his pants zippered.  What a foolish thing to focus so severely on.  He sounds like a moron when he basically sums up someone's presidency by whether or not he kept his pants zippered.  I really couldn't care less what any president did with his weewee.<br /><br />Hey, Hitler may have had a few faults here and there, but he kept his pants zippered.  What kind of nonsense is that - focusing on such a stupid issue.  I repeat, the emphasis on a president's sex life as being a determining factor in his value as president is absolutely moronic.  I can only guess what kind of negative training the author received on the subject of sex when he was a little boy in Irish Catholic school.<br /><br />He really tears Nixon a new one.  I think you know what I mean.  And I don't think that is an inappropriate thing to do, even though Nixon turned out to be very effective with the Russians and Chinese.<br /><br />He presents the positive side of LBJ, his firm stand on human rights in America, while correctly blasting him for his total failure in Vietnam, getting us involved so deeply, costing us so many American lives, all for NOTHING, as events were to prove.  I'm pleased with the way he accurately paints LBJ and the disastrous and ill-conceived Vietnam War.  To those of you who now believe that the Vietnam War was anything but a complete national disgrace, both morally and strategically, I have to tell you that it was the single lowest point in American history, and it was indeed a national disgrace.  We never should have sent troops there, period, not for any reason at all.  We were the bad guys, and we lost.  There was nothing ambiguous about it.  So many Americans were sharp enough, and moral enough, to realize that we were the bad guys in Vietnam, that Congress finally cut the purse strings of that demonic war.<br /><br />Not to be a Democrat basher, I also like the way the author covered Reagan.  He correctly portrayed Reagan as perhaps the most beloved president we ever had, right up there with Washington.  Everybody loved Reagan.  He was lovable, what can you say.  On the other hand, Bush the First was absolutely correct when he accused Reagan of \\"voodoo economics\\", and Reagan's economic policy of giving tax breaks to the rich and giving nothing to the working people was really bad, and caused a horrible deficit.  We have the same philosophy now with Bush the Second.  It's not a good thing economically.  Only an idiot could support subsidizing the ultra-wealthy and ignoring the working people, the way Reagan and Bush Jr did.  That is the single worst thing about the neo-cons.  They are all for the wealthy and they are a curse to the working people.<br /><br />I didn't like one thing that the author said about FDR.  He said that FDR \\"took a lot of guff\\" from historians about his inactivity with regard to the Holocaust.  Isn't that tough.  Well, the victims of the Holocaust, the Jews, the Jehovah's Witnesses, the intellectuals, the democrats, the gypsies, the homosexuals, everyone who fell afoul of the German regime, \\"took a lot of guff\\" from the Nazis, didn't they.  The fact thatFDR didn't lift a finger and forbade our bombers from even dropping one bomb on the train tracks leading to the death camps, or on the death camps themselves, is a sickening aspect of FDR's presidency.  The fact that FDR kept Hitler's dirty little secret about the mass murders is the single most sickening thing that FDR ever did.  Had he made a worldwide issue of it, had he told what he knew, perhaps the Jews and others would have fought harder to escape the Holocaust, to join a Resistance.  If FDR had done the right thing and opened his silent mouth, perhaps the German people themselves would have lost faith in their fuehrer, and perhaps a few more top German generals would have become sickened by their fuehrer.  It is possible that by keeping Hitler's dirty little secret from the world and being in effect a co-conspirator to mass murder, FDR prolonged the war by 3 years.  Who is to say that Germany would not have withdrawn its support from that madman had they been forced to face what he was up to.<br /><br />A lot of the material in this book is light reading, like Taft at 350 pounds getting stuck in the White House bathtub several times, needing aides to lift him out.  It was also interesting to me to read that Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of a cheating husband, had herself a lesbian lover.  Good for her.  I don't mind one bit that she didn't keep her pants zipped, Cormac.  God bless her, let her have a little sexual fulfillment in her life.  She deserved it.  She was a good woman who deeply cared about Americans.The fact that FDR didn't lift a finger and forbade our bombers from even dropping one bomb on the train tracks leading to the death camps, or on the death camps themselves, is a sickening aspect of FDR's presidency.

I don't think at all like this author.  I don't get anything from his symbols and explanations.  I looked up some of the degrees that mean something in my chart, and I found no value in his readings.<br /><br />Another thing I noticed, confirming my negative rapport with this author, is that he obviously is familiar with the Charubel and Sepharial degree readings and he prefers Charubel and ignores Sepharial.  I believe that Sepharial provides the best set of degree symbols I've ever seen, and I would place Charubel lower on the list.<br /><br />This author turns the zodiac upside down, ignoring the traditional order of the signs.  He is extremely individualistic.  That isn't necessarily a drawback, but it isn't necessarily a positive either.  Since I don't identify with anything he does, I don't consider it a strength that he is so far out on his own limb here.  It would be different if he knocked me out with his readings.  I was hoping he would, which is why I bought the book.	2005-08-17
US	39820807	R3FMZMR9TM7IHG	1933303050	699904094	The Degrees of the Zodiac Symbolized (Astrological Manuals)	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Underrated sets of degree symbols	I bought a very small hardcover book containing the degrees of the zodiac symbolized by Charubel and Sepharial decades ago, back in about 1970.  I was very impressed with the symbols, particularly with Sepharial's.<br /><br />Recently I have been comparing the symbols of Charubel and Sepharial with the Sabian symbols of Elsie Wheeler.  It's a very interesting study.  I may write a book about it.<br /><br />The Sabian symbols are the most famous degree symbols, but my introduction to this subject was the book you are thinking of buying right now, the Charubel and Sepharial symbols.  Of the three sets, I'd have to say that the Sepharial symbols are the clearest.  You don't miss what he's driving at.  It isn't too vague, as Charubel sometimes is, and as Wheeler occasionally is.  Sepharial puts the meaning of the degree right out there where you can't miss it, and usually has a human protagonist in his symbols to make it even clearer, as opposed to some sort of geometric shape or other.<br /><br />Sepharial claimed to have gotten his symbols from a publication called La Volasfera, but I understand that nobody has ever seen La Volasfera, and at least one writer suspects that Sepharial made them up himself.  What is La Volasfera anyway?<br /><br />Astrology is such a complicated subject, with so many planets to keep track of, their positions in signs and houses, their aspects to each other, and also their decans and degrees.  Complicated as it is, I think the study of individual degrees of the zodiac is worth adding to the list, because the readings are interesting and accurate.	2005-08-16

I leveled the playing field, adding homerun power to dead ball hitters and cutting it back from modern hitters.  The game has reminded other people of the movie about Shoeless Joe Jackson and the other players getting the chance to play ball once again, in Kevin Costner's back yard.<br /><br />Walter Johnson is clearly the greatest pitcher who ever lived, based on his stats.  His 5 best years are better than any other pitcher's.  His 10 best years are better than any other pitcher's.  Not only is he the toughest pitcher of all time to pitch any given inning, but he gives you a lot more innings than the other top guys.<br /><br />You could make a case for Pedro Martinez.  His \\"per inning\\" stats over a 5 year prime are comparable to Johnson's, but he won't give you the innings, so his value to a team is limited by the amount of innings you can use him.<br /><br />Koufax would be more competition for Walter Johnson if Koufax had 10 great seasons, but unfortunately he was misused and his arm couldn't take the misuse.  Still, Johnson was better.  It is astonishing to actually say that someone was better than Koufax, because I remember watching Koufax when I was a kid, and the man was awesome.  I wasn't even a Dodger fan.  I can understand how the fan of an opposing team could get all caught up in watching Walter Johnson.  It's amazing to watch a true artist at work.  Koufax was the best I have ever seen.<br /><br />The reason I didn't give the book 5 stars was because there's just too much repetition about what a wonderful man Walter was.  Enough already.  You can tell me once, twice, five times, but by the 800th time I'm tired of it.  That's what happens when your biography is written by your grandson.  It gives the book a sort of pathos that it can do without.  It's uncomfortable.  Poor grandpa is dead.  He was such a nice man.  Everybody loved him.  Anyone who didn't is a rat.  Alright, already.was such a nice man.  Everybody loved him.  Anyone who didn't is a rat.  Alright, already.	2005-08-14

Perhaps the Sun was in Scorpio, the Moon in Pisces, Mercury in Sagittarius, Mars in Capricorn, Leo Rising.  All of these positions influence who you are in this life.<br /><br />But your body dies and is left behind when your immortal soul proceeds to its next destination.  The fact that you are a Scorpio in this life doesn't mean that your eternal soul is Scorpio.<br /><br />We are mixtures.  You may be a male Scorpio in this life, with a female soul of a different sign.  Your soul is the true, eternal you.<br /><br />Your date of birth doesn't reveal what your soul's sign is.  By understanding yourself you can recognize your soul sign in this book.<br /><br />Where did the author get her information?  She is a medium.  Her information came from a spirit who communicates with her.<br /><br />I realize that's a lot to swallow.  I once had a session with a medium, and my impression was that the person was not what he claimed to be.  I believe he was a performer, not a medium.<br /><br />As for Rosemary Altea, I'm impressed with this book and I hope she is what she claims to be.<br /><br />There are similarities between her soul signs and the astrological signs.  The four elements are the same - fire, earth, air and water.  Instead of the three \\"types\\" (cardinal, fixed, mutable) this book has three divisions called Introvert (subjective), Central (balanced), and Extravert (objective).<br /><br />If the three divisions can be correlated to each other, then it appears to me that the subjective soul signs would be the cardinal astrology signs, because the quality of being subjective is most similar to the meaning of the cardinal signs.  The balanced soul signs seem most certainly to be the mutables, adjusting to left or right as a mutable sign would.  The objective soul signs would be the fixed signs.<br /><br />We would then have the following correlations between astrology signs and soul signs.<br /><br />Aries is the Retrospective Soul.  Taurus is the Warrior Soul.  Gemini is the Prophet.  Cancer is the Seeker.  Leo is the Bright Star (an obvious choice anyway).  Virgo is the Visionary.  Libra is the Traveler.  Scorpio is the Old Soul (another obvious choice).  Sagittarius is the Dreaming Soul.  Capricorn is the Hunter.  Aquarius is the Newborn.  Pisces is the Peacemaker (another slam dunk).<br /><br />It is commonly thought that Aquarius is a water sign because it is the water bearer.  The Newborn is one of the air signs in this book.  But Aquarius is in fact an air sign.<br /><br />Our 12 signs are peculiar to this Earth.  They are related to the soul signs but are not identical.  Perhaps the 12 signs would manifest themselves somewhat differently elsewhere in the universe.<br /><br />To use this book you must first understand the four elements and determine which your soul belongs to.  In short, if you have a passionate, self centered, blazing energy, you are fire.  If you are a planner, a strategizer, a do-er, a controller, a builder, you are earth.  If you are more passive and calm, you are air.  If you have an instinct to please all, and to evaluate, you are water.<br /><br />Rosemary's descriptions are much more complete than the little phrases I have just offered you.  I was able to spot my own element by first ruling out two of them, then deciding definitely on one final choice by reading more in her book.<br /><br />Realize that words are just tools.  They can spark ideas.  Don't get hung up on the words.  Don't sit back and place all the responsibility on the author to have every word apply to you.  Get the big picture and figure out who you and your friends are in this system.<br /><br />If your response is to say that all of these descriptions are ambiguous and can be applied to anyone, the truth is that you have a lazy mind and you are incapable of getting the picture.  The fault isn't with Rosemary's words, her tools.  The problem isthat you are too lazy or stubborn or thick to use them.<br /><br />There is one other sign and element in this book.  It is the Dark Soul of the element Sulphur.  There is no astrological correlation.  This is the soul sign of Hitler and other evil people.  They have no love in them.  Their only joys are to corrupt, frighten and hurt others.<br /><br />That may be true.  But I would refer you to the book Personality Types by Riso and Hudson.  In their system, not only are there 9 different personality types, but there are also 9 levels of each type, ranging from the healthiest to the sickest.<br /><br />I would suggest the possibility that Hitler did belong to one of the 12 soul types but was a very depraved example of the type.  This book tells us that the evil ones all have a type to themselves.  Hitler may have been an example of a fire soul gone as bad as fire souls can possibly go.  Perhaps a Riso-Hudson approach could split each of the 12 soul signs into a few levels, best to worst, eliminating the need to set aside a toilet bowl to dump the evil ones in, and calling this toilet bowl the Dark Soul of the element Sulphur.  Then again, maybe the author is correct.<br /><br />I would love to read more about the soul signs discussed in this breakthrough book.words, her tools.

I created a game that allows me to manage the best players who ever lived, to get to know them by putting them in lineups and playing out games and seasons.  It was fun to read the autobiographical stories of some of these old players.  It is also great to see their photos, and every contributor to this collection of stories has a photo in the book.  Many of them appear in my game.<br /><br />There were two famous bad plays discussed in the book, the time that Merkle failed to touch second base, costing his team an important game, and the time Snodgras missed a fly ball, costing his team an important game.<br /><br />In the pages of this book we learn that Merkle's failure to touch second base was a result of fans storming onto the field, believing the game to be over with Merkle's team winning, causing Merkle to rush for the locker room instead of blasting his way through a crowd to get to second base.<br /><br />We further learn that the defense never threw the ball to second base to get Merkle out, so in a sense, that play still has not been resolved.  There's still time for Merkle to touch second base.  And we also learn that a similar play had occurred shortly before that game, and the umpire ruled in favor of the runner, not insisting that he fight his way through a crowd of fans on the field.<br /><br />With regard to the fielding error by Snodgras, we learn that immediately after that error, Snodgras made an exceptional play in the field, robbing another batter of a hit, so Snodgras wasn't such a goat after all.  The media is blamed for making goats of these two players.<br /><br />The baseball players have conflicting opinions about the famous New York Giant manager John McGraw.  Almost all of them revered him, but one spoke up against him, saying that he was excessively critical of his players, abusive, and that the player refused to play for McGraw until McGraw actually gave assurances that he wouldn't treat him like garbage.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Hank Greenberg chapter.  Contradicting claims made about him, he said that he was not prevented from breaking Babe Ruth's 60 homerun record by the antisemitism of opposing players.  While he admits that he was walked a lot during the last days of the season, he also points out that Bob Feller struck him out a few times, and that the pitchers in the American League were throwing him hittable balls.  His reason for failing to hit more than 58 homeruns in a season was that he ran out of gas.<br /><br />It's nice to know that baseball was not corrupted by antisemitism.  Greenberg admits that some opposing players shouted antisemitic remarks at him, but he says that this was no different from the way they would always pry for sensitivities, trying to get every opponent rattled, standard procedure by the bench jockeys of the time, nothing personal in their abuse.<br /><br />Though Babe Ruth was not alive to be a contributor to this book, a number of the contributors mention him, and it is always with fondness, with adoration.  He was beloved by his contemporaries.<br /><br />I found it interesting to read descriptions of Walter Johnson and some of the other all time greats.  Johnson was blazing fast, with an easy, smooth delivery, like Koufax.  He was also beloved by his contemporaries, a modest and wonderful man.<br /><br />For those of you who aren't up on your baseball history, Babe Ruth was by far the greatest player who ever played the game, and Walter Johnson was by far the greatest pitcher of all time.<br /><br />For modern fans, think in terms of Pedro Martinez in his prime as a fastballer.  Project that out to 20 years of it, and you have Walter Johnson.<br /><br />Some of the oldtimers in this book compare players of their day to more modern players.  One conclusion is that the old timers were smarter.  Another conclusion is that the modern players are bigger, stronger, faster.<br /><br />The main difference is that in theold days the ballparks were bigger, the baseball was deader, and the three run homer didn't win nearly as many games as the single slapped beyond the infielders.  It made sense in those days to play a smart version of little ball.  It made sense for batters to choke up on the bat and hit like Pete Rose.  These days it makes more sense to swing free and shoot for the fences, because they are much more attainable than they used to be.<br /><br />If you found these comments interesting, you will really enjoy this book.  If not, it's not for you.n difference is that in the old days the ballparks were bigger, the baseball was deader, and the three run homer didn't win nearly as many games as the single slapped beyond the infielders.

My four star rating is definitely a thumbs up.<br /><br />Now I will start criticizing.  My first complaint is that the author leads us by the nose to one conclusion, then does a 180 and leads us to the opposite conclusion, half a dozen times.<br /><br />For example, he makes a very strong case that Bismarck was guilty of demanding far too much from France at the war's end, placing the blame on Bismarck.  Fine.  The territorial demands (Alsace-Lorraine, etc.) and the reparations demanded by Bismarck in 1871 bring World War One to mind.<br /><br />Then he turns right around and tells us that Bismarck wasn't at fault at all, but was in fact trying to reign in the demands of those around him.  You can't have it both ways.<br /><br />He does the same earlier, a number of times.  It is a pattern of his.  He convinces us, for example, that the French should have been more aggressive militarily in this or that situation, and a page later he tells us that such a course would have been suicidal.<br /><br />I believe that if I had been sitting next to him as he wrote this book, and had drawn his attention to his flipflopping by screaming WHAT!!!, he would have edited his book and corrected this fault.  He does it over and over.<br /><br />In one section, a certain general is horrible, and in the next, that same general was right all along, and a bit further on, he was a moron.  It is not a question of the general sometimes on target and sometimes not.  It is flipflopping about the same man doing the same things, interpreted differently from one page to the next.<br /><br />Let's be clear on who our morons are and who our tacticians are.  Should the man have broken out of his position or not?  We really can't have it both ways.<br /><br />The strongest part of the book may be the last few pages.  Wawro explains that the reason for World War One was not France's fury at the demands of Bismarck, the reparations and the land grab for Alsace-Lorraine.  The French were well past all that.<br /><br />He blames World War One (and Two) on the legitimacy given to militaristic (...), the Prussian elite, thanks to their victory in France.  The Franco Prussian War made these ignorant and selfish sons of b.....s into heroes who seemed to know what they were talking about.  The victory legitimized the use of war for nationalistic gain.  It overly impressed the German people, who then followed other militaristic (...) into one disaster after another.<br /><br />Wawro also makes the point that the arch-conservative Prussians were too stubborn for their own good, opposing the French republicans, not realizing that those same republicans (anti-monarchists) were a bulwark against a complete overturning of the system as later occurred in Russia.<br /><br />I would compare it to relieving some pressure in order to save what can be saved.  The arch-conservatives were rejecting the moderate conservatives, and would only be satisfied if a lunatic fringe conservative right ruled all of Europe.  But you can't win that way.  It only opens the door to revolution.  So the Prussians were shown to be fools with their ultra-conservatism, destroying their own house.  I don't see a Kaiser in Berlin today, so they obviously didn't succeed.<br /><br />Much of this book repeats to us that the French were a pack of idiots during the Franco-Prussian War.  It's easy to say in hindsight that the losers were a bunch of morons.<br /><br />The military lesson of this book is that heavy artillery trumps infantry.  The side with the biggest cannons will beat the side with the best rifles.  To take it further along in history, the side with the massed tanks will beat the side without massed tanks. Whoever has the biggest fist wins.  Blitzkrieg in a nutshell.<br /><br />That would seem to be a pretty good rule of thumb, although the Pittsburgh Pirates did manage to beat the New York Yankees in the 1960 World Series.  Let's say that the guy with the biggest fist usually wins, but not always.<br /><br />I can't fathom anyone accusing the French of cowardice in this war.  The descriptions of battle are horrific.  Shells are exploding all around, ripping bodies to shreds.  In the face of all that, soldiers of both armies are racing forward in the teeth of rapid fire shooting.  My God!  Courage is taken to insane heights.  How can these people be criticized for lack of it?<br /><br />As the book 1984 argues, anyone can be broken down.  You can take the bravest hero, subject him to something he can't deal with, and he'll break.<br /><br />This world is a dangerous place.  If you don't get it in war, if you protect yourself in every imaginable way, you still aren't safe from the ravages of cancer.  We can criticize humanity's lack of the kind of love that Jesus spoke of, or even of a simple live and let live attitude.  We can criticize humanity's endless, eternal stupidity.

I want to read anything that will tell me.<br /><br />This book leaves me wanting a lot more.  It touches on the question, but doesn't give enough substance.<br /><br />It tells us that there are a dozen heavens, a dozen hells, and many realms that are finer than heaven.  That is the closest it comes to telling us what the afterlife is like.  But that is clearly not enough.<br /><br />How do you know there are a dozen hells?  Describe each one.  Make us feel what it is like to be there.  The same for the heavens.  Make each one of them real for us.  Make them so real that we will be able to recognize which one suits us best.  It's too easy to say there are a dozen of them.  That means nothing to me.  It's just words without a real connection.<br /><br />And if there are a dozen of them, what makes you think that you will see your loved ones in the one you are going to.  They may just as well be in another one.<br /><br />We're told that there are eleven levels in the afterlife.  The ninth is \\"the end of manifest vibratory creation\\".  The tenth is \\"the void, nonvibratory or pure consciousness\\".  The eleventh, the highest, is \\"full at-one-ment and entry into states of consciousness beyond human comprehension\\".<br /><br />Tell me something.  Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What the hell is the end of manifest vibratory creation?  Do you understand what I'm saying?  This book is throwing words at me, and they don't mean anything to me.  I want to feel and understand this.<br /><br />And don't start telling me it is beyond human comprehension.  You are writing a book to be read by humans.  We comprehend things.  Make us feel it.  Get beyond occult-speak and make it a real and meaningful experience for us.<br /><br />The problem seems to be that the author really doesn't know, and the thousands of people she interviewed really don't know, what the afterlife is like.  But with thousands of interviews with people who have been there, I would hope for more, and I would expect more.<br /><br />Contrast this book with the first two books by Michael Newton, called Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls.  Those books are full of detail on the afterlife.  There is so much more \\"meat and potatoes\\" in those two books.  They fill you up a lot better.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the Michael Newton books is that nobody else wrote a book corroborating his findings.  Detail is there in abundance.  I'm waiting for one of his proteges to write a book that expands on his, and gives us a lot of new material.<br /><br />The Newton books also make me feel more empowered.  They make the afterlife seem like a place where we actually have some control over what happens.  It's a place I can't wait to arrive at and enjoy.  As for the afterlife in We Live Forever, it feels too impersonal and unsatisfying to me.  I didn't even get one good view of one of the heavens.  Why would it be meaningful to me to be told that there are 12 of them, and I don't know what any one of them is like.<br /><br />The really frustrating part of it is that I don't think the author knows either.  If she does, what do I have to do to get her to tell me?  If she knows a lot more than she revealed in this book, I feel like shouting at her that she really has to consult with me before writing any more books, because she is missing the boat.<br /><br />If she really knows something, her next book would be a hundred times better than this one if it is simply an interview with me questioning her.  I'd bring her out, and elicit the important information.  That's why this book leaves me unsatisfied.interviews with people who have been there, I would hope for more, and I would expect more. <br /> <br />Contrast this book with the first two books by Michael Newton, called Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls.

A Brazilian Jiu Jitsu book would tell you to wrap your legs around him and maneuver for a choke or an armlock.  This book tells you to wrap your legs around him and snap his neck.<br /><br />I see no reason to criticize this book.  Sometimes, people criticize in order to show off.  If you are dissatisfied with what an expert or author is doing, that must mean you know more than he does.<br /><br />But the fact is, this book does have a lot of good information in it.  That's the bottom line.  There are hundreds of self defense books.  This book can't be all of them.<br /><br />If you want the ultimate self defense instruction, here's what you do.  Stay home.  Watch tv.  You'll be fine.  Just don't slip in the shower.<br /><br />When you really think about it, the best way to protect yourself is to avoid being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Don't fall asleep on the subway.  Don't be out at night.  So to those of you who are dissatisfied with the advice in this book, will your own personal favorite self defense book protect you as well as the advice I just gave you?  I don't think so.<br /><br />So take the book for what it's worth, appreciate the gift the author has shared with us, and stop complaining and showing off.<br /><br />A good, informative review should show how this book differs from the others you can buy.  Well, this one is from the point of view of a soldier who could care less whether he kills his opponent, and has no fear about being charged with murder.<br /><br />A lot of the techniques are along these lines.  Avoid the blow, secure the attacker's arm, whack him til he sees stars, execute a judo throw, and strangle the s.o.b. to death.<br /><br />The martial art it reminds me of most is Krav Maga.  It isn't like the more technical ground fighting of BJJ or Sambo.  It's the art and science of what works, for those who aren't about to spend six years learning complicated moves.<br /><br />The pictures are easier to follow than the explanations.  Seeing something, having it make a visual imprint in your brain, makes it a lot easier to absorb.  You look at the series of drawings and think to yourself \\"yeah, I can do that\\".<br /><br />Anyway, like me, you probably have had a lot of martial arts training, so this stuff isn't really that new to you.  It's a way of selecting from all the moves you have already learned and focusing on a few that you should think of first.<br /><br />Okay, bring em on, eight opponents at once, all armed with knives and clubs, I'm ready.  I pity them.  I'll be spraying their eyeballs all over the street, and they'll be gasping for one more breath.<br /><br />I wonder if anything good is on tv tonight.hnical ground fighting of BJJ or Sambo.

In a universe of high quality books, this one stands out as exceptional.<br /><br />The author is both brilliant and original.<br /><br />He goes beyond telling us that it is important and beneficial to eat our organic fruits and veggies.  Most books stop right there, when you really analyze them.<br /><br />Why do some people need 100 times more Vitamin C than others do?  What is the connection between our minds and our bodies?  Where another book may tell us that the path to health is through diet, nutrition, vitamins, etc., Ballentine tells us that the most important element is your own mind.  You have to deal with your issues.<br /><br />In this regard, he agrees with Gary Null, who always says that the single most important factor in health is happiness, and that all the vitamins and organics in the world don't match the importance of living a happy life.<br /><br />I just got to the part in this book where Ballentine explains that our chemistry and physics teachers were wrong when they told us that the elements in the periodic table can't be transformed into each other without a nuclear reactor operating on them.  The enzymes in our bodies, and in the bodies of chickens, fish, etc., are quite capable of transforming one element into another, gently, without that nuclear explosion.  Potassium, sodium, iron, copper, calcium, are being switched around inside the bodies of living creatures.  Nitrogen is sometimes transformed into carbon monoxide.  Amazing.  Chickens are capable of making their own calcium, out of other elements, in order to make egg shells.<br /><br />It's nice to find such an original thinker in this field.  And you get the impression that he definitely knows what he's talking about.  The fact that this book was written decades ago means nothing.  We still haven't caught up to him.  He's still ahead of us.  He was a century ahead of us 20 years ago.	2005-06-22
US	39820807	RUAEAFOFGIA2U	0451171357	85902037	The Agony and the Ecstasy: A Biographical Novel of Michelangelo	Books	4	42	70	N	N	Some faults, please	I'm always conscious of the number of positive and negative votes a Customer Review receives.  I see on this site, as on almost all sites, that the reviews that give the most stars and the most praise also get the most positive votes, and those that have something critical to say get the most negative votes.  That is the biggest flaw of the Amazon review system.<br /><br />My natural impulse is to find fault.  No matter how great an accomplishment was, I seek ways to improve it.  It's part of my personality.  Rave reviews bore me.<br /><br />Granted, this is a very impressive book.  Now that I've read it, the name Michelangelo means a lot more to me than it did before.  Since it was written nearly 500 years after the great artist lived, I can't help but doubt that it captures his personality accurately.  It is the author's conception of the artist, and not the artist himself.<br /><br />I've given the book four stars.  I think it is a very good book.  But are the author's impressions accurate?  Were the popes generally a bunch of autocratic warlords, as depicted here?  Were the artist's rivals as obnoxious and foolish as they appear here?  Mr Stone lets us know who his bad guys are, right off the bat, no shades of gray.  We know who we are supposed to hate.  He is very loyal to his Michelangelo.<br /><br />There are some ambiguities in this book.  One is Michelangelo's sexuality.  He is obsessed with male physical beauty and develops crushes on good looking boys.  He never has a long term love relationship with a female.  And yet, Mr Stone is unwilling to tell us that Michelangelo was a homosexual.  No, of course not, not our boy.<br /><br />Stone's descriptions of sex in this book are laughable.  The one time our hero actually makes love to someone, Stone describes it foolishly, as some sort of perfection.  To listen to Stone, it was Michelangelo's first time, his loss of virginity, and Stone is describing it in such trite and perfect terms, the union of two souls, blah blah blah, what nonsense.  If it was in fact Michelangelo's first time, it should have been described much more awkwardly.  Stone doesn't describe sex here.  He describes poetic nonsense.<br /><br />Stone also gives us a little acceptable sexuality when he describes the act of sculpture as a sex act.  The stone yields its passion to the hammering of the sculptor, whatever.  Stone is only comfortable discussing sex in ridiculous terms.<br /><br />After making it more than clear that Michelangelo's sexuality is ambiguous, going so far as to say that every artist is almost hermaphroditic, he then tells us that when Michelangelo was accused of homosexuality the accusation is just to be scorned.  So our author is sitting on both sides of this fence, isn't he.  Sort of a \\"so what if he was, but of course he wasn't\\".<br /><br />There are times when he overly and inaccurately defends Michelangelo.  For example, the Carrara marble incident.  Michelangelo travels to Carrara to obtain marble, then travels to a different site to obtain higher quality marble, the people of Carrara attack him for what they consider his betrayal, the author lets us know that he did not betray Carrara, but then there he is hunting down superior marble elsewhere.  He almost succeeded too.  Stone is again telling us \\"no - he is innocent, but so what if he's guilty\\".<br /><br />We are told that Michelangelo had a \\"terrible/awesome\\" personality, then again that he did not, and was just standing up for himself reasonably in the face of bullying, and then again we are back to hearing admissions from both the author and the artist that he could be a real piece of work sometimes, very hard to take.  Which is it?<br /><br />I found myself getting confused about which projects he completed, which he failed to complete despite being paid to do them, just the general facts.  Some of our worst \\"bad guys\\" are the people who seem to just be insisting that Michelangelo fulfill contracts for which he had already been paid in full.<br /><br />There is a very odd and sterile love affair with a female late in the book.  All things considered, I have the impression that Michelangelo was drawn to this woman because he knew that he wouldn't be pressured into actually sleeping with her.  This affair, ostensibly proving his heterosexuality, may just be further evidence of the opposite.  I'm not criticizing him.  If he was homosexual, God bless him just the same.<br /><br />Another problem I had while reading the book is that the author kept stressing how poor Michelangelo was, how he failed to profit financially from all his hard and brilliant work.  I had the impression of the author whining to us about it.  Often, this book seems like a catalogue of Michelangelo's complaints, against the popes, against his father, against his competitors.<br /><br />It's easy to find fault, if you aren't blind deaf and dumb, and if you have the ability to think for yourself.  This is an absorbing book.  It is pretty long but it didn't bore me at all.  I give it a very happy thumbs up.  But hero-worship annoys me, and this book has its imperfections.  It is only about 100 times better than anything I ever wrote myself.or which he had already been paid in full. <br /> <br />There is a very odd and sterile love affair with a female late in the book.

US	39820807	R2M2DBZPJKZRCB	159420019X	240296592	The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin	Books	4	4	11	N	N	The insulted hero	The main point I took from this book is that Ben Franklin's conversion from loyal British subject and lover of the King of England to American revolutionary occurred primarily as a result of ridicule heaped on him by the British Parliament in his presence.  So his Americanization, or radicalization, was a result of hurt feelings, was a grudge against those who turned on him.<br /><br />He would have been happy to be a loyalist if only the British had flattered him.  Isn't that childish?  His idealism, his devotion to the cause of American independence, was nothing but his childish revenge at being personally insulted.  It had nothing to do with British policy or any political issue.<br /><br />Not that the American Revolution was a question of black and white idealism.  We often hear that it wasn't, that it was a question of economics.  We hear these days that the Boston Massacre was the fault of the Americans, that the British were innocent, that they were only defending themselves from a mob.  The American Revolution wasn't a war of good vs evil as World War Two was.  So Franklin can be excused for not knowing which side to land on, until he was personally insulted and his feelings of pride and revenge got involved.<br /><br />That, in a nutshell, is the Americanization of Ben Franklin.  But the book covers other material as well.  One of the most interesting parts to me was Franklin's life in France, where he was loved and appreciated as much as Jerry Lewis.<br /><br />John Adams comes off as a big boob in this book.  An utter fool.  I doubt it.  I think the author chose to give us a cardboard John Adams to knock down, because he was a rival of Franklin.  Adams is certainly not three dimensional here.  He isn't even two dimensional.  He is just on the left side of the line, the negative side, of a one-dimensional line, where the right side is intelligence and the left is nothing but a boob.<br /><br />Franklin comes off as a bit of a boob too, in places.  He kind of more or less sort of supports or doesn't object to the Stamp Act, but then when he is stunned by the violent reaction of the Americans to it, he goes oops, and he changes his tune.  And he goes through the same thing about the Boston Tea Party, thinking the British actions were pretty much okay, maybe, who knows?, but then being surprised at the violent reaction of the revolutionaries, and offering to pay for the tea himself.<br /><br />To the author's credit, he does explain why the British felt it necessary to tax the colonists.  They were in a deep financial hole thanks to the French and Indian War in support of the colonists, and they needed to recoup their losses.  The English people were taxed more heavily than the Americans to begin with.  Franklin was correct to be ambivalent to these taxes.  Again, the American Revolution was not a black and white case of good vs evil, so sensible people could land on either side of the question.<br /><br />Franklin does not come off as an unqualified hero.  He had a lot of sense and ability as an ambassador, and he was extremely important to the war effort primarily because he managed to get the military and financial assistance of France, without which the result could not have been what it was.  For this reason alone, he is considered to be second only to Washington in importance.<br /><br />On the other hand, he treated his wife churlishly, abandoning her, not caring about her a bit, while she suffered physically and pined away at home for him.  Her sin was a lack of sophistication, and his weakness was vanity.<br /><br />He prided himself on being a chess player on a grand stage, a world mover and shaker, but he completely misunderstood what was going on half the time.  Later in life he realized that world events are not like a chess game, but more like a dice game, and his fallback position was that God controls, people don't.<br /><br />Was his main strength simply that he knew how to play the French, or to put it another way, that the French loved his act and appreciated his anti-aristocracy views?<br /><br />In the end of the book we are brought firmly onto his side by our sense of sympathy.  Here he was, having secured America's independence from England, surrounded by idiots like John Adams who did nothing but obstruct, and America failed to appreciate their real hero.  Only France got it right, and adored the man who fleeced them, who used them, who inspired them to their own revolution.<br /><br />Franklin comes off strongest at the end of the book.  We are told what his religious views were, and they make perfect sense.  He believed in a creator, he did not believe in the divinity of Jesus, and he considered organized religion to be more divisive than unifying, and therefore probably more trouble than it is worth.  I'd go along with him on those points.<br /><br />He would have hated today's right wing loonies who think the Bible is the dictation of God Himself, and who don't even know what is in the Bible in the first place, thinking it is all about the evils of sex and abortion, when the fact is that abortion isn't mentioned once in that old collection of fictional myths and semi-history, and sex, whether hetero or homo, is far from central to the plot, is in fact barely touched upon, occasionally.<br /><br />Franklin opposes the two-part Congress, the separation of Senate from Representatives.  Why are there two houses of Congress anyway?  Apparently it is to mimic the House of Lords and the House of Commons, and the Senate is the American version of the House of Lords, designed to give the wealthy a much stronger presence in government than the commoners.  The Senate represents the power of the aristocracy, and Franklin saw no need for it.<br /><br />Why do we have two houses anyway?  I see his point.  But to me, the rich have undue influence in every branch of government.  It's their country, not ours, and the one thing we are called on to do is shut up and do what we're told.<br /><br />I think the book is worth reading.  Go read it.

This one takes us from Biblical days to the not too distant past, to the 1960s.  It takes a realistic look at Biblical times, not an overly religious look.  It makes you want to visit Israel.<br /><br />It was interesting to read that the young Israelis of the early 1960s found it so foreign to them that the prior generation succumbed to the Nazis without putting up more of a fight.  Today's Israelis have to fight for their existence, and they do it well.<br /><br />Then again, today's Israelis have a country of their own.  They are not a despised and mauled minority surrounded by vicious, satanic enemies, as their ancestors were in the mid 20th century.  That in itself is a powerful argument for the existence of Israel.	2005-04-05

It is a privilege for us to be able to read a true account like this.  The author brings us along with him as he defends America against the most evil nation in mankind's history - Germany.<br /><br />We can take Germany lightly now that it has been destroyed in war and is tame, but Hitler's plan was to make short work of Europe and then come over here and invade America.  That is what all his \\"secret weapons\\" were for.  They were for us.<br /><br />In his mind, and in his plans, the main opponent was not Britain or Russia.  It was the USA, and he was on his way.  Just read his second book, and find out about the massive buildup in the works, targeting America in a much bigger way than Osama Bin Laden ever dreamed.<br /><br />The American GI helped to stop this satanic nation in its tracks, before it got here, before it could wrap up part one and move on to part two of its plan to take over the world.  Europe was just Germany's \\"appetizer\\".  The main course was America.<br /><br />The SS conducted mass murders of innocent civilians when they retreated from a town.  They experimented on people by ripping the skin off their bones.  This would have happened when they retreated from Cincinnati, from Muskogie, from New York City, from Nashville.<br /><br />These people weren't simply following the orders of a syphilitic madman, Hitler.  They were following their own inclination.  In this case, the leader was the nation in microcosm.  Hitler was the true image of Germany and the German people.  He was evil, he was crazy, he was sick, and he had to be stopped.<br /><br />Who stopped him?  Well, Roscoe did, for one.  Freedom loving Roscoe Blunt, a great symbol of America.

This book discusses a question without giving the answer.  The subtitle is The Search For Dark Matter In The Universe.  That's right.  It's about the search.  Reading this book is like spending a few weeks with a flashlight, poking around in the dark.  When the last page is done, you still, as U2 sang, haven't found what you're looking for.<br /><br />Before reading this one, I read a book that told me that the dark matter consisted of Jupiter-sized black holes in space, millions of them, formed in the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang.<br /><br />This book mentions that possibility but doesn't buy it.  The answer here is that the dark matter consists of sub-atomic particles speeding through space, flying through planets and stars without being stopped by them.  They also fly right through our skin and bones, constantly.  Do I have that right?  Who the hell knows.<br /><br />On the back cover, the author is described as a \\"superbly clear writer\\".  I wouldn't go that far.  Consider the source - another physicist.  Clear to him.  He knows this stuff already.  Clear as mud to me.  Well, some of it, anyway.<br /><br />We now believe that from 90% to 99% of the stuff in the universe is invisible to us and undetectable by our technology.  And we think that stuff is ... umm ... chocolate pudding.  We're testing for it.  Maybe that stuff is heaven.  Or maybe the calculations are way off and there is no dark matter, and we shall soon prove that we don't exist.<br /><br />I was surprised to see how the processes of physics and cosmology seem to work.  We fantasize.  We imagine.  What if ... ummm ... what if there was a particle that was such and such a size and had such and such properties .... would that explain anything?  Okay, let's say that it exists, let's call it a floooeyon.  Now let's go search for it.  This reads like sci fi.<br /><br />Hey, Henry, I think what happens is that for every particle there is an anti-particle, and when they collide they destroy each other, and there are exactly the same number of particles as anti-particles, but then again there may be 1,000,000,001 particles to every 1,000,000,000 anti-particles, and they all destroyed each other, leaving 1 particle undestroyed, and that particle, multiplied a gazillion times, is what makes the universe.<br /><br />What???????<br /><br />No, for real.  It is a ballooneon.  Now if only I could measure the effect that one ballooneon has when it flies through the earth and bangs into a proton in a big vat of orange juice below the surface of the earth, we'd be all set.<br /><br />One of the strongest impressions you take from this book is just how unimaginably huge the universe is.  There are billions of galaxies.  With that in mind, it seems that only an absolute fool would believe that this is the only inhabited planet.  Instead of thinking that the UFO-believers are loonies, it seems that the UFO-skeptics are the loonies.  We are less than a grain of sand in the universe.  Of course there are others out there.  Otherwise, what are all those billions of galaxies out there for?icle there is an anti-particle, and when they collide they destroy each other, and there are exactly the same number of particles as anti-particles, but then again there may be 1,000,000,001 particles to every 1,000,000,000 anti-particles, and they all destroyed each other, leaving 1 particle undestroyed, and that particle, multiplied a gazillion times, is what makes the universe. <br /> <br />What??????? <br /> <br />No, for real.

Like most of the others, it tells us to avoid meat, fat, sweets.  In these general ways it agrees with everything the health experts are always telling us, except of course for Atkins, who is on a planet of his own.<br /><br />The main difference here, for me, is that we are told to really fill up on the whole grains.  It is supposed to be the number one ingredient for us.<br /><br />What is a whole grain anyway?  No, it is not the whole wheat bread in your grocery store.  In fact, when you go to the local health food store and look for whole grain bread, you had better ask the store employees for help, because breads aren't necessarily labeled whole grain.  Some are, some aren't.  If it has white flour, it is not whole grain.<br /><br />I found a bread based on brown rice, and to my surprise it was really tasty, when toasted.  It was frozen in the health food refrigerator.  It is hard, substantial, and good.<br /><br />I was surprised to see that corn is mentioned in the whole grains section of this book.  Shows what I know, right?  So buy that corn on the cob.<br /><br />Brown rice and whole grain pasta are also in the category.  Get the book to see what other whole grains you should be making the number one ingredient of your daily diet, according to this book.<br /><br />The book then discusses beans.  Basically, get every kind of bean.  Vegetables are good too.<br /><br />One thing that this book tells you to avoid is Nightshade vegetables.  That includes potatoes, tomatoes and eggplant.<br /><br />The book advises you to have an occasional piece of fish if you want, but to choose the lean fish like sole, flounder, scallops, and to avoid the fatty fish like tuna (oh my god!).<br /><br />It attacks milk in a big way, blaming milk for a lot of heart-related deaths.  It also has charts correlating fat intake to prostate and breast cancer.<br /><br />I'm prepared to change my eating habits based on this book, to incorporate more whole grains and beans.  I eat pretty healthy already, but I have a problem or two I need to deal with.<br /><br />I don't know if the author's claims that nightshade vegetables are bad for you, that it is not a good idea to drink a lot of water, and that Vitamin C is much less important than we think, are correct or not.  Sometimes he really goes \\"against the grain\\".<br /><br />If the author reads this, I have a special message for him.  You need someone like me to edit your book.  There are a lot of editing problems in it.  I'm doing that already for another published author who didn't go with one of the big publishing houses.  I can get rid of the mistakes in here.

All of the stars we see just account for 10% of the matter in the universe.  The other 90% is invisible.<br /><br />How does he arrive at this conclusion?  A certain amount of mass is necessary to provide enough gravitational force to balance the opposite force in the universe, the force that drives stars away from each other.  Without this mass, the stars would be hurtling off into space, not forming galaxies.<br /><br />And the stars we can see only account for 10% of the necessary mass.  What is the other 90%?<br /><br />He answers this too.  The other 90% of the matter of the universe is composed of black holes the size of beach balls and the mass of Jupiter.<br /><br />What leads him to say that?  He'll explain it all to you.  It has to do with variations in the light of far-away quasars.  He believes that this light is varying because it is being seen through the \\"lens\\" of a lot of little black holes that happen to exist in the line of sight between us and those quasars.<br /><br />What is a quasar?  What does baryonic mean?  What is a black hole?  What is inflation?  There is a terrific glossary near the back of the book.  It might be the best part of the book.  You will learn a lot just from taking your time browsing through the glossary.<br /><br />It is mind-boggling to me that all these millions of little black holes would have formed within the first millionth of a second of the universe's existence.<br /><br />If there is a creator, she was certainly not hurried by our conception of time.  She came from a place that isn't hampered by time constrictions.<br /><br />He addresses the debate between the Big Bang and the Steady State theories, and he believes that the Big Bang necessarily supports the existence of a creator while the Steady State does not.  I don't really see his point there.<br /><br />If you choose to believe in a creator (and I can't think of a reason why you should back away from that idea, except for being utterly fed up with the nonsense of Noah chasing around the arctic to kidnap polar bears and haul them to the Middle East in a damn hurry) you are pretty well stuck with her (the creator) even with the Steady State theory.  Wouldn't she have been the one who made the stars in the first place?  That's her job, no?<br /><br />This book also leaves us with the cheery thought that the world's scientists tend to be stubborn, jealous, impressed by status, rarely objective, and a bunch of annoying crapheads.  Thank you for letting us know.  It renews my faith in humanity.dresses the debate between the Big Bang and the Steady State theories, and he believes that the Big Bang necessarily supports the existence of a creator while the Steady State does not.

I am a radical, and I am disgusted by both Republicans and Democrats.  The one issue that differentiates me most from liberals is Israel.  They support the Satanic terrorists who target children on school buses, and they think that is the liberal position to take.  I just don't get it.  Finally, someone put forward the truth on this issue.  The truth is that Israel is fighting for its life in an insane part of the world where they are hated, where the Holocaust isn't over, where Hitler still lives.<br /><br />If I was in charge of Israel I wouldn't be anywhere near as mild as the Israelis are towards the terrorist Palestinians.  I'd be at war with them.  I'd push them off the land, period.  If those $@#^&#^&  can't accept my right to live, I can't accept their right to be my neighbor.  They forfeit all their rights, including their right to life, when they encourage their own babies to kill themselves on the chance that they will take a Jew with them.<br /><br />There will be no peace in the Middle East until the bigoted Arabs stop spewing hatred of Jews on their radio and tv, in their newspapers, mosques and schools.<br /><br />A \\"liberal\\" told me that I was a racist because I didn't also say that there couldn't be peace in the Middle East until the Jews stopped hating the Arabs.  Baloney.  The Jews aren't the problem.  The Jews want peace.  How do you have peace when some *@^&*%@#@$  are targeting your children and your women for first degree murder?  You don't.  The fault is entirely on the Arabs, on the Palestinians, on that dead $&%@$^ Arafat.<br /><br />I know that to a liberal I sound wrong and one-sided.  But you have to stand up and tell the truth, regardless of who it offends.<br /><br />If you disagree, I challenge you to read this book.  If you do, and if you have a usable brain in your head, you will finally understand what has been going on in Israel and Palestine the past 80 years or so, and you will finally understand what is behind today's headlines.  It is the Arab-Muslim determination to prevent the Jews from controlling any territory at all in the Middle East, even the size of a postage stamp, despite the fact that they are the majority in the areas they control.<br /><br />The Jews can only live in peace in Arabia if they accept slave status, if they accept having rocks thrown at their grandparents by Arab three-year-olds without any recourse to correct the situation.<br /><br />It is important for you to read this book if you disagree with the above comments.  Dershowitz presents you with the truth.  Check it out.  How many times in your life do you have the chance to do a 180 on an important issue.  Dershowitz will teach you something you don't already know.  I highly recommend this book to people who disagree with me, to otherwise principled people, to liberals, to those who consider themselves ethical.  It's time you discovered the truth.

He meets Ms. Right, Angela, and doesn't place any value on being faithful to her, which depends on how much sex she has been giving him lately.  Actually it kind of makes sense.  To me, a really beautiful marriage would not include having the wife turn her husband down and frustrate him.  But it also definitely wouldn't include either of them maintaining secrets from the other, sneaking around.  Will she take the dog back?  Give him a second chance?<br /><br />The other main characters are Derrick's longtime male friends, Tony, Ben and Mark.  Tony's problems concern an ex-girlfriend who had a child with him and who now complicates his life.  Ben's problem is that he falls for pretty young girls who use him for his money and don't care for him.  Mark's problem is the friction caused by the reaction to inter-racial dating.<br /><br />This story held my interest.  That's what a book is supposed to do.	2004-09-04
US	39820807	R27PQVIY8V0JB2	042518613X	185638418	What If? II: Eminent Historians Imagine What Might Have Been	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Thumbs up	This book is composed of 25 essays by different authors.  The topics are all historical what ifs.  What if Jesus had not been crucified?  How would history have played out differently?<br /><br />Most of the essays spend most of their time giving the reader a history lesson.  Before they can go off on their creative imaginings, their what ifs, they first must tell us what actually happened.<br /><br />In fact one of my complaints with the book is that too much of it is an explanation of what happened, and too little of it is getting to the point of how history would have changed had one event not happened.<br /><br />Here are the counter-factual events discussed.  Socrates dies before becoming Plato's teacher.  Antony and Cleopatra defeat Octavius.  Pontius Pilate spares the life of Jesus.  William the Conqueror becomes William the Loser.  The medieval Chinese discover America before Columbus does.  Martin Luther is burned at the stake.  Charles the First doesn't provoke the English civil war against the Puritans.  Napoleon's forces in the New World do not die off from illness, and proceed to make a big move in America.  Lincoln doesn't sign the Emancipation Proclamation.  France doesn't provoke war with Germany in the 19th century.  Teddy Roosevelt defeats Woodrow Wilson on the eve of World War One.  Germany unleashes all-out submarine warfare in World War One.  Lenin is not permitted to return to Russia in time for his revolution.  Franklin Roosevelt's career is derailed before he runs for president.  Hitler does not sign Chamberlain's peace pact over Czechoslovakia.  Winston Churchill is not called to be prime minister; Lord Halifax is.  Australian resistance to the Japanese in World War Two does not materialize.  The Allies fail to break the Nazi Enigma code machine.  The Pope openly protests the Holocaust before it takes much of its toll.  Allied forces are given free reign to blitz Germany as fast as they can.  Hitler is taken alive.  America does not nuke Japan.  Truman is not FDR's running mate - Henry Wallace is.  Nixon, Johnson and Kennedy do not attain the political heights.  Pizarro the conquistador does not discover potatoes in Peru.<br /><br />If these topics intrigue you, buy the book and get the opinions of 25 authors on these subjects.  Some of the essays are interesting and enlightening, some are controversial, some will just seem incorrect to you.  But I give the book a thumbs up overall.<br /><br />For one example, the essay on Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon doesn't really tell you an awful lot about how the world would have been different without them.  It just tells about their early careers, and how it would have easily been possible for them to fail to reach the heights.<br /><br />The essay on Jesus doesn't seem to really hit the mark.  It basically says that a Jesus-based Judaism would have spread to the Roman world.  I don't believe that.  I don't think Christianity would have become the official religion of Rome if Jesus was simply considered a prophet, not a savior.  And without Jesus's death, he certainly would not have died for anyone's sins.  I think Jesus's crucifixion was necessary for the birth of Christianity.  So I disagree with the essay.<br /><br />The essay on America not nuking Japan seems to be well informed and one of the better ones.  The conclusion is unlooked for - that nuking Japan was the best and most humane choice open to America, and that although Japan was actively seeking a negotiated settlement, its insistence on retaining its entire government intact would have simply meant five more years of war, with starvation for millions of blockaded Japanese, since an armed invasion could never have succeeded, alone or with Russia's help, against one million fanatical Japanese warriors who knew exactly where the attack was coming.<br /><br />I'm amused to learn that without the potato, western civilization would not have dominated the world.  I like them baked, myself.  No butter.  Justsour cream.o butter.  Just sour cream.	2004-08-27

The curse was that the white rapists/seducers would die.  This curse mutated through generations to the point that even black husbands of black women died, and the black women themselves sometimes died early deaths.  The Lafayette family suffered from this curse all the way into present times.<br /><br />The central characters are Elizabeth Big Momma Lafayette, her daughter Sadie, her granddaughter Jeanette, and the men in their lives, Sadie's white and black lovers, and Jeanette's black lover.  The men are all driven sexually wild by a magic perfume.  The women are all sexually precocious beyond their years, from an early age.<br /><br />Who will die and who will be saved?  That is basically what the plot is about.  Much of the story centers around the interesting personalities of the main characters, particularly Sadie and Jeanette.<br /><br />This is a memorable and interesting book.  The last 150 pages speed by.<br /><br />The only faults of the book are first, that we must accept voodoo as real, whether we like it or not, and second, that there are quite a few problems with the editing.  Commas are misused and compound words are separated.  An English teacher or a perfectionist would find something to correct on many of the pages.<br /><br />I wish the author would contact me to edit his next book or to re-edit this one.  He's such a good writer.  Why have any errors in the book?  You might see the word passed instead of past, or over looked instead of overlooked, and inappropriate use of commas throughout.  It doesn't interfere with your enjoyment of the book, but why not fix it?	2004-08-08
US	39820807	R2XP50209VGHHW	0449911934	437546793	Rabbit Redux	Books	1	11	21	N	N	Morbid	I am reading the Rabbit series nearly in backwards order.  I began with the third book, Rabbit Is Rich, and liked it so much that I picked up the book on Amazon that includes all four in the series.  Curious about how it all ends, the next one I read was Rabbit At Rest, the final book.  It is excellent, and the ending is very emotional and powerful.  I then decided to read book 2, this one.  Midway into it, I couldn't believe how bad it was.<br />To put my reaction into a sort of context, I walked out of the movie Leaving Las Vegas, or whatever it was called, because it was simply too morbid for me.  These sad sack addictive personalities drive me nuts.  I can't sit there and watch them destroy themselves.  I'd greatly prefer that they killed themselves quickly and left me alone.  I do not enjoy wallowing in garbage.  I do not sympathize with self destructive morons.  I can't help them, and I don't want to suffer with them.<br />This book features a weak young girl named Jill who allows herself to be destroyed by a nut case named Skeeter.  Skeeter has some very valid points to make about American history, but he's not much of a house guest.  I can't say I learned anything of value from Jill or Skeeter, so their sad sack story, their viciously morbid story, is pointless to me.  Why suffer through it.<br />Rabbit just lets things happen to him and to the people around him.  For a few moments he wakes up and exerts himself.  He objects to Jill turning his son into a lying beggar on the street, and he goes so far as to smack her around.  Then why doesn't he object to Skeeter turning Jill into a pathetic junkie?  That seems quite a bit more serious.  What is wrong with this idiot?<br />Another problem in the book is that Rabbit's wife Janice leaves her lover at the end, for no reason I can see.  Her reason seems to be that the author told her to, after making it clear that she loves him desperately.<br />Judging from the more mature work, Rabbit At Rest, I thought John Updike was among the great writers of all time.  Judging from this garbage, Rabbit Redux, I have modified my view.  All I can do is shake my head and say to the author - what got into you?pdike was among the great writers of all time.

They are ignoring the single most striking thing in this book.  They have failed to notice an elephant in the refrigerator.  They peek behind the elephant in order to get a slice of American cheese, and they have failed to take stock of the elephant.<br />This book says that nearly all of us are possessed by evil spirits who answer to Lucifer.<br />One problem with hypnosis as a tool for uncovering hidden truths is that the hypnotist can lead the subject.  The subject doesn't know if what he is seeing and reporting is true.  It might be coming from the imagination.  And any leading questions by the hypnotist can take the subject on quite a ride.<br />For example, if I hypnotized you and then asked you if you were possessed by Satan, perhaps you would say yes, perhaps you would say no.  But you don't know.  Your imagination picks up the ball and runs with it.<br />I would have to see the actual transcripts before I could even entertain the possibility that the author's central tenet is worth considering.  And I would have to take a peek at the room, and interview the subjects to determine their preconceptions.  On the face of it, this seems absurd.  It reminds me of Salem, Massachussetts.  Time to start burning the witches again.<br />I believe that this book is well-intentioned but misguided superstition and fear.<br />I strongly recommend the works of Michael Newton.  He is another hypnotist.  I suspect that his techniques are more pristine, less suggestive.  His clients report that spirit possession is probably impossible - thousands of his clients have said they never saw any evidence of it.  Not one of his clients reported one case of spirit possession.<br />Further, his clients have never verified any contact with a Biblical character, not Lucifer, not Satan, not Beelzebub, not Beetlejuice, not Caspar the friendly ghost.  Guess what - those characters are in the realm of fiction.<br />BOO!!!  Did I scare ya?  This book is medieval.This book is medieval.	2004-06-15

Obviously, being the last of the Rabbit series, it is about our hero's demise.  There's very little I can say that won't &quot;spoil the ending&quot; for you.  The ending is really touching.  The author ties it all together.  He even closes a loose end about his &quot;other&quot; daughter, letting us know that the girl he met at the car lot, and making a reprise at the hospital, is in fact his own biological daughter.  He goes the way he should go.  And his wife and son react just right.

You can get a good idea of the plot by reading one of the other reviews on this site.<br />I've already given this book my praise, that it holds your interest.  It's more interesting to me to discuss the flaws.<br />Flaw number one is the godlike omniscience of the hero, Harry Niles.  He KNOWS exactly how history will unfold.  He knows that America will win the war.  It's a slam dunk.  And he focuses on oil oil oil oil and oil as the five reasons that America will win.  Isn't that topical.<br />It seems to me that the victory over Japan was not a slam dunk.  America was aided greatly by breaking the codes and therefore knowing when and where and with what strength Japan would attack.  It is just too damn easy, after the fact, to say with certainty how things would develop.<br />Let me suggest a reasonable alternative ending to that war.  Let's say that FDR had a more conciliatory personality.  He may have arrived at a negotiated peace that allowed Japan, and for that matter Germany, to hold on to some of their early winnings.<br />What I'm saying is that the nearly unconditional surrender of the Japanese and Germans was not a foregone conclusion in 1941, but to Harry Niles it was.  Funny how strong hindsight can be.<br />In fact, several other characters in the book also had the same certainty of Japan's ultimate and total defeat, and this greatly impacted the big surprise ending.  Sorry, but it's just a bunch of bull.<br />My other complaint with this book is that it has what I call a &quot;too cute&quot; ending, which is rampant in modern novels.  They don't tell us how things end.  The author leaves us hanging, and we are supposed to draw our own conclusions.  What happens to Harry Niles and his girlfriend Michiko?

One was the theme mentioned in the title, the unsung heroes of the holocaust.  The other was its opposite, the villains of the holocaust.<br />As we read about this or that Christian who risked all to help a stranger, we also read about the Nazi collaborators, the anti-semitic actions taken, the villains of the period.  This book makes you angry, with a cold hatred.  It makes you hope there is a Hell, a suitable punishment for acts of cruelty committed during this life on Earth.<br />How many times do we read about helpless sweet children below the age of six being hunted down by grown men, insane men, stupid men, sadistic men, Germans and their collaborators.<br />In one of the reports, we read about a little 5 or 6 year old girl who is asked her name.  She answers with the Christian alias she was given, and then she cheerfully adds that her real name is something else, a Jewish name.  Why must this little child be careful?  What kind of world was she living in, that forced insane, unnatural caution on an adorable child?<br />Perhaps my \\"favorite\\" report in this book is when the Germans were tipped off by an informer that a little 5 year old Jewish girl was being cared for by a Christian family.  These grown German men tracked the little girl down.  They had already decided to kill her, but that was not enough for them.  First they had to make her final hour one of panic and pain.  They whipped the child.  When they were done with their sadistic fun they killed her.  Then they killed the Christian family of eight that had cared for the little girl.<br />It is amazing that this sick German culture actually believed that they were in some way \\"superior\\" to the Jews.  Not for nothing, but these Germans were morally inferior to a pack of wolves, certainly sub-human.<br />The book is infuriating.  If it does not infuriate you, there's something missing in you.<br />But there are positive things in here too.  I am not referring to the acts of individual heroism, which, by the way, seem to be carried out more often by women than men.  I'm referring to the nations in which there was no anti-semitism.<br />Denmark, Albania and Bulgaria are described that way in this book.  I knew that Denmark wasn't viciously anti-semitic but I learned from this book just how beautiful a people the Danes were.  And I had absolutely no idea that the Albanians and Bulgarians were so kind.  I'm impressed.  Belgium also came across very well.<br />I was disappointed to learn that Holland was not as gentle and civilized as I had thought.  This book tells us that Holland had its share of anti-semites and informers.  It seems to be about equal to France in the fact that while the majority wished to protect the Jews, a sizeable minority were quite happy to slit Jewish throats.<br />This book tells us just how bad the Polish people were in general, most of them perfectly happy about the holocaust.  After all, the Jews killed Christ, so they were only getting what they deserved.  Amazing that people think that way.  Some people seem to have descended (as opposed to ascended) from the ape.  There were also many Polish heroes in the book, all the more impressive given the general attitude prevailing in the country, with its added risk of informants.<br />But of course the inside track to Hell is owned by the German people.  Even their allies the Italians considered anti-semitism the German disease, and refused to cooperate with the murders.  Italy, and the Pope, were portrayed very positively in this book.  I was told elsewhere that the Pope was a Nazi collaborator, but he didn't appear so in this book.  The Pope, here, was a strong supporter of the Jews, and saw to it that all of Italy was too, except for those Italians who milked Jews for every penny they could extort.<br />I understand why other reviewers would object to the writing style of this book.  It is a series of anecdotes.  They are just piled one on top of the last.  But it is a reasonable way to approach the subject, if your aim is to recognize the unsung heroes of the holocaust.  Okay, here's this hero, here's the next, and this is what they did.  It's not a novel.  The organization and the writing style are what they are.<br />I expected to read more about the Croat attempt to exterminate both the Jews and Serbs during this period in history.  The Croats were cruel, which prompted the reprisal by the Serbs as soon as Marshall Tito died.  We think of the Serbs as the villains of Yugoslavia, but during World War Two the Eastern Orthodox Serbs and the Jews were victims of the Catholic Croats in an extermination that was truly German in its cruelty.  I mention the religion of the Serbs and Croats only because that is the only way to tell them apart, since they are one and the same people racially, differentiated only by religion, according to another book that you can buy on Amazon, whose name I have forgotten.<br />The next time some racist idiot says there was no holocaust, hand it this book.just piled one on top of the last.

Books	4	6	11	N	Y	4 out of 5 aint bad	One of the reviewers on this site noted that all of the reviews he saw either gave this book 5 stars or 1 star.  Well, I'm breaking the mold and giving it 4.<br /><br />It is depressing to read this book, in the same way that it is depressing to read one of Noam Chomsky's political books.  It just makes American government out to be so bad.  I can't say it's not true.  I can't say with any confidence that Moore's paranoia and negativism are unjustified.<br /><br />I'm a listener of listener-sponsored WBAI radio.  It is the bastion of liberalism on radio.  Moore has been on, and so has Kucinich and many other well known liberals/radicals.<br /><br />My only problem with the radio station, and with Chomsky and Moore, is that they parrot the official liberal position on Israel, the evil bully of the Middle East.  I don't see it that way.  I think it must be very difficult to be surrounded by countries that hate you and have tried several times to drive you into the sea, because they refuse to recognize your right to live.<br /><br />The Palestinian leaders have many times refused a separate state because they had to acknowledge the existence of Israel in order to be given their own state.  That's apparently asking too much.  The desert is apparently too valuable a piece of real estate to share with non-Muslims.<br /><br />Aside from that one issue, I really like Moore's new book.	2003-11-15

I won't review the plot because the others on this site have already done that and you don't need it from me.<br />I'm always looking for something to criticize, and it's not easy to find in this book, but here goes.<br />Every book and movie you see has an obligatory love interest.  So does this one.  Why is it that every time we have an adventure in our lives we also happen to run into our soul mate?  It's a convention that I am frankly sick to hell of.  The gods of publication have determined that there shalt be a love angle in every story.<br />King Lear didn't have a romance angle and it was still a pretty good story.  Brothers Karamazov was a little short in that dept if you ask me, and it still wasn't a bad book, was it?  Don Quixote didn't really have a romance interest either, though it had a silly old man deluding himself over a woman he didn't know.  I wouldn't call that a romance.  So I wish the publishers and authors of today would occasionally cut that aspect out of the &quot;formula&quot;.<br />Another convention that annoys me is that I know well enough who's going to win.  It will be close, the hero will be in a whole lot of trouble, will almost lose, but something good will happen in the end to save him from his predicament.<br />Yes I know we are rooting for the good guy, but let's face it, were you ever really concerned that Captain Kirk would get killed by a Klingon?  Or that the ending would be less than total victory?  It's satisfying this way but it's too formulaic.<br />And the way our good guys and bad guys are defined for us.  In this story the author uses certain methods of defining that.  For example, the bad guys are Vietnam wartime atrocity guys.  Gee, duh, that's controversial.<br />Are we in favor of wartime atrocities or against them, let me see........<br />One good guy is defined as a minister.  One good guy is someone who prevented a war crime, saving a civilian from a sadist.  Gee, that's awfully controversial.  Do we really want to root for someone who would save a civilian from a sadist?<br />These kinds of quick, scribbled character portrayals to define whether we should like a guy or not are just too obvious, just little formulas quickly shaken off the pen of creativity.<br />This type of thing comes with the genre.  It's like reading a murder mystery by Mary Higgins Clark or most anyone else and knowing in advance that the killer will not be the suspicious looking guy, it will be the guy in the suit.  Your best dressed character is surely the bad guy.  Alright already.  Down with cliches!  Death to cliches!me, saving a civilian from a sadist.  Gee, that's awfully controversial.

Actually the review I liked best on this site was the critical one by Jimmy Price.  While reading this book I definitely got the impression that America's generals were stupid and incompetent.  I have no way of knowing if that is in fact true.  I also had the impression that Germany's generals were excellent.<br />I didn't walk away from the book believing that Germans are simply superior militarily to Americans.  I walked away thinking that Germans at this point in history had a number of invasions to use as experience.  They invaded Czechoslovakia, Poland, the low countries, France, Greece and Russia.  Naturally they would be superior to the rookie Americans in their first campaign.<br />My biggest problem with this book is that I didn't feel the changes of momentum.  One minute the Germans were awesome, and the next I'm told they are out of ammunition and oil and they are surrendering in the thousands.  I didn't feel it.  One minute I'm told that General Patton is an incompetent blowhard who is peripheral to the action, a nonentity, and the next minute I'm told that he's already a celebrated hero in the press, and I just didn't see cause and effect, and I hesitate to chalk it up to his big mouth and his press clippings.<br />The English generals fare no better.  They seem to just want to send Yankees to their death in hopeless situations, and then blame the Yanks for not being more aggressive.<br />Despite the author's best efforts, and maybe he did all that can be done, I really didn't feel this war in this book.  It's wrapped up a little too neatly, in a way.  This happened, this happened, this happened, and here's my take on it, and this guy is an idiot, and here's your war.	2003-11-01

King of Torts is about the legal specialty of soliciting large groups of people who have been hurt by a product<br />Several of the cases in this story are prescription drugs gone wrong.  One of the drugs induces tumors in its victims.  Another, if you can believe this, causes some of its users to go out and kill strangers.  That pill is a bit hard to swallow.<br />But I don't think it is utterly farfetched to the point of impossibility, considering that all of the children who shot their classmates in school were on prescription drugs at the time, a fact only mentioned in passing in the papers and media, but a fact that deserves BOLD CAPITALS when you are asking why kids kill.<br />Those drugs, including ritalin and its close relatives, come with warnings that they may cause homicidal or suicidal tendencies.  So the bad prescription drugs in King of Torts are not that farfetched.<br />Our hero, lawyer Clay Carter, is not on a crusade to punish corruption, to punish those who knowingly sell dangerous prescription drugs to the public.  Rather, he is on a crusade to make hundreds of millions of dollars for himself.<br />And of course you have your obligatory romance.  And the girls are, of course, knockouts.  What goes up (financially) eventually comes down.  In other words, the story is formulaic.  But so is pretty much every other story out there, and almost without exception, every movie you see.<br />Next time, John, give us a love interest who is a worse than average looking girl with a weight problem, keep the rich folk the hell out of it, and let's have some people we can identify with.<br />Anyway, the story does carry you along.  I read it in just a few days.  I just wish it was a little more real, a little more relevant to my life, and a lot less focused on the obscenely wealthy and the beautiful.  Screw them.  Who wants to read about them.	2003-09-23

The children in this book, I don't know if you root for them to be alright or to die a grisly death.  They are about the most annoying children I've ever seen in fiction.  You want to smack one of them, and the other one, well you want to smack that one too.<br />One thing I don't get.  The swarms of tiny robots can be blown away by a strong wind.  So why not attack them with battery-powered Vornado fans?  Or politicians.<br />In any event, the story gets quite silly when the swarms of molecular robots start taking the shape of the people in the story.  I guess it would get some oohs and aahs in the movies.  But it is ridiculous.<br />All in all, it is a knockoff of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.	2003-09-16

We don't really have a protagonist that you can identify with.  What we have is an immature young girl who unintentionally &quot;bears false witness&quot;, incriminating an innocent man and sending him to jail.  Because of this, it is a dark book.  There are no heroes.  Just a big OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOO.<br />Another oddity of the book is that we are given two completely different endings, which reminds me of Life Of Pi.  First we get the ending that we are prepared to accept.  Then in a sort of afterward, we are told that the ending we just read is not the real one, and that the real one is in fact much worse, much less satisfactory.<br />As I said before, this is an interesting book.  But it is also an exercise in banging your head against the wall.	2003-09-08

As I was reading this book, I felt that it was non-fiction.  This was not the product of a writer's imagination.  It was the truth.<br />It is a story about Puerto Ricans in the South Bronx.  The star of the book is Coco, an unmarried girl with a handful of children by different men.  She's such a wonderful person, warm and loving and cute.  This book makes you want to go to her, solve all her problems for her, hold her hand, touch her face, smile to her.<br />I spent my teenage years living in a Puerto Rican neighborhood in Brooklyn.  It wasn't nearly as bad as the drug and violence infested South Bronx of this book.  It was also a long time ago.<br />I do have some complaints though.  My main one is that almost every male in the book is horrible, with the exception of two men who learned a lot during their time in prison.  Nearly every man outside of jail is a waste of skin and bone, utterly selfish and demanding, utterly useless, and morally depraved to the point of sexually abusing children.<br />Another complaint is that we are used to unified stories, but this one follows Coco, Jessica, and whoever else, as it meanders through various streams for us, following one life or another for a while before moving on.<br />It is one of those books that you don't want to end, you are afraid to come to the end.  The end means you will never hear from darling Coco again or her precious kids.<br />The ending of the book is marvelous.  It is simply a father giving some loving attention to his children.  I had tons of that when I was little, but the children of this book have precious little of it.	2003-08-31

We are drawn into an \\"inner city\\" world, a world of poverty, squalor, drug addiction, violence.<br />And yet in some ways, this world is sometimes transformed into a utopian cloud.  There is no racism in this world.  The white, in fact Jewish, father, feels perfectly safe walking through it after dark with his pre-teen daughter.  Excuse me, what world is this?<br />In a park, in the dark, this white man and his young daughter have no fear or caution in the presence of a group of male teens who could pose any number of threats.  Let's not confuse racial harmony and idealism with blindness and insanity.  No, you don't take your 12 year old girl there at night and then talk loudly in order to attract the attention of the boys in the park.<br />To increase the racial utopianism, there are inter-racial romances here.  Apparently in Newark NJ or its clone (aka Dempsy, in this book) the races are all just one big happy family, perfectly at ease with each other, and hopping into bed.<br />The story is very well written.  You are carried along, even though the time line is choppy.  We go from one date to another, from past to future to past to middle.  By the end of the book we are placed firmly in the middle, when the big assault occurs.<br />You can learn a lot about the storyline from the other reviews on this site, some really detailed and excellent.<br />Halfway through the book I found myself counting the prime suspect out.  There is one prime suspect, so obvious, and since we are reading a novel and not experiencing real life, it was apparent to me that the prime suspect can't possibly be the assaulter.  I considered it a strike against the author, that he most likely followed the old formula of misleading the reader about the guilty party.  I expected a surprise ending.  They all have them.  The culprit must be someone else, someone you don't expect, but someone already described in the book.  I had no idea who it could be, and I was half-hoping it was in fact the prime suspect, showing that the author had the nerve to go against the grain and simply tell us who did it, and it turns out that's who did it.<br />You'll have to read it yourself to find out.  Maybe good old Freddy did it, and maybe he didn't.  Maybe it was suspect number two, Salim, and maybe it wasn't.  It couldn't have been daughter Ruby.  Could it?  No way.  Could the girlfriend have done it?  Nah.  Freddy, we're back to Freddy.  But could Richard Price really buck the system that much and have our prime suspect actually guilty?<br />This book gives us a good lesson in personality types.  I recommend the psychology books by Don Riso.  The title character, Ray the samaritan, is a Type Two in Riso's personality type system, the helper, the giver, the instant friend, the easy touch.

By the end it gathers some comic-book traits reminiscent of the legion of superheroes.<br />A book is all too often a product of its time and culture.  This book is so annoyingly \\"politically correct\\".  When our pc heroes get the upper hand and defeat an evil villain, they are so careful not to harm the evil one.  We're taking an opposition to capital punishment to a foolish level when our conscience cries out to us not to harm Hitler, to make sure he doesn't stub his toe while under our supervision.  The red-blooded and more natural reaction would be \\"kick his butt\\".  This bloodless, goody-goody quality is very annoying to me.<br />Oh no, don't leave the poor bad guy out in the cold.  He might freeze his tootsies.  Oh gee, that would be too bad wouldn't it.  He just killed your mother and father, stupid!  That's the sort of namby pamby attitude that annoys me.  It is annoying because it is purposely put in there to appeal to the bloodless ones among us who would pedicure Hitler before leading him to his golf prison.<br />Shifting back to the positive, and this book does deserve a positive review, we get some interesting plot lines.  The characters aren't very well developed.  They are set pieces.  The friendly bear, the wisecracking chick, and a rather cardboard autistic boy.<br />It's easier to quibble than to praise.  So here's another quibble.  The entire book can be summed up by its most repeated phrase, with Jilly patiently and lovingly saying to Shep \\"Come on, sweetie, fold us out of here\\" while the bullets whiz by and the boy is saying \\"ice, ice, ice\\" or \\"cake\\".<br />It reminds me of a He-Man cartoon I once saw.  Someone was in deep trouble, the villain was on the doorstep, and He-Man was slowly walking to the rescue.  One of my kids had this episode on tape, so I saw it over and over and over.  I always yelled out at the screen \\"Take your time, He-Man!\\"	2003-08-10

But I'm having a lot of trouble.  It has so little in common with any of the other sources I've seen on this subject, and so many of the &quot;letters from the other side&quot; are so similar to each other.  I believe that the author wrote them herself, or that they came from a source within her, what you might call her subconscious.<br />The books I consider to be the best are Michael Newton's Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls.  If they are true, then where does that leave this book?  The two concepts of the afterlife are diametrically opposed to each other.<br />The only way to fit some of these reports in with what others have said about the afterlife is that the spirits who wrote these letters are mostly ghosts who have not yet left earth and gone to their home.<br />I haven't finished the book yet.  I'm about two thirds done.  I find these letters depressing.  Some report that there is nothing there, no Heaven, no people, and that they create their own Heaven with their thoughts.  What a lonely thought that is.<br />Do you mean to say that after we die we go to a place where we are all alone with our thoughts?  How boring.  What a lot of nothing that would be.<br />Some of the letters disagree, and say that there are other people present.  So there is no unified concept here.<br />Some of the writers have the exact same writing style as each other.<br />The reviews on this site are uniformly enthusiastic and disagree completely with my own reactions.  I don't mean to be argumentative or to rain on someone's parade, but I'm just being honest here.  I don't think this book is for real.<br />The view of the afterlife in this book is not a good one.  All we have is our own thoughts?  Spare me.	2003-07-09

Obviously, the second story is the true one, and it is absurd for reviewers to claim that they don't know which is true.  The second story will shock you and make you sad, and it will make you understand why the boy had to construct the other story.  I don't want to spoil it so you will have to read the book to find out what happens.

I found this book very readable, but there were times when I wanted him to go back and explain something very basic about his subject, to let me catch up.  It would have helped if I had thought to look in the back of the book for a list of definitions.  It's there, but I only discovered it when I finished the book.  I think a list of definitions would be the type of thing you'd want to put at the beginning, not at the end.  Well, now you know it's there.<br />A simple concrete example is his use of the word &quot;brane&quot;.  He gives some explanations, and it is obviously key to a lot of his thought, but I really didn't have the concept.  I ended up looking on the internet to learn more about what a brane is.  For your benefit, it is short for membrane, it isn't a misspelling of brain.  If I've got it, our universe may or may not be on a brane, and there may be several branes stacked up near each other, and they must be quite large if they contain universes.  I really need some help getting the big picture.  Mathematicians focus on the numbers and take a lot of the basic background material for granted.<br />The picture I'm getting is that what is large to us, like the countless galaxies that make up the universe, is small to those who are looking at a bunch of stacked up branes, each of which contains a universe, or for all I know, countless universes.  Don't look to me for tutoring in physics.  But I think the kind of basic questions and misunderstandings that I have would make for a decent interview with Stephen Hawking, because it would bring his ideas and explanations closer to the lay reader.<br />One thing I've noticed about him is that he seems overconfident.  He seems to think that we are on the verge of a breakthrough that will explain all.  Even I know better than that.  The next generation of physicists will simply disprove everything he believes in, just as Einstein's theories have had holes poked in them.  A thousand years from now his theories will seem quaint.<br />I was taught that gravity is a force of attraction that exists between any two objects.  I never could picture that.  If I put two big rocks on a table, I wouldn't see them inching towards each other.  I see no reason why there should be a force of attraction between objects, other than magnetism.<br />Stephen Hawking redefines gravity for me.  In his hands it is no longer a force of attraction between two objects - at least not solely that.  I'll give you my own version of an explanation, not too dissimilar to Hawking's, but clearly my own.<br />Imagine a glass full of water placed on a couch.  Now imagine a large object, like Luciano Pavarotti, sitting down on the couch next to the glass.  He will get wet, no?  The glass will be &quot;attracted&quot; to him.  That is because the depression that he made in the couch is so close to the glass that the glass will fall into it.  There's gravity in a nutshell.  It is a curvature of space that is made by big objects.  And it draws other objects into it.<br />Now my next problem in understanding gravity is that I don't see the couch that the Sun is sitting on.<br />Hawking also helped me to understand the concept of &quot;other dimensions&quot;.  I could never picture in my mind what was meant by other dimensions.<br />How do we go from two dimensions (a piece of flat paper) to three dimensions?  Add a bunch more paper on top of the first, and you have depth.<br />How do we go from three spatial dimension (as we have now) to four spatial dimensions (forget about the dimension of time, don't drive me crazy)?  We take our whole planet, our whole universe, our whole brane, and we stack a bunch more on top of them.  So that makes our universe or our brane no longer something with a depth of countless miles.  It makes our universe a flat object (relatively speaking) with a depth of 1.  Flat as a piece of paper.  Think of it as the outside skin of a balloon.  The whole inside of the balloon is the next spatial dimension.  As for why time is a dimension, go away and leave me alone.<br />Hawking knocks down the straw man of newspaper astrology, as if it needed to be knocked down, but does so in a casual and unconvincing way, clearly not the result of a lot of thinking.  I wonder if he knows that Isaac Newton was a strong believer in astrology, and that newspaper astrology is a very poor example of the subject.  If he ever chose to really look into the subject he'd do well to start with Robert Hand and Grant Lewi.  They can't be laughed off as vague and useless.<br />The answer that Isaac Newton would have given to him is the same one he actually gave to the scientist Halley.  Newton simply told Halley that he, Newton, had looked deeply into the subject, and Halley didn't.<br />Hawking's case against time travel is also unconvincing.  What seems like impossible obstructions to him may prove to be hurdles that will be surpassed eventually.brane, and we stack a bunch more on top of them.

The single most powerful element in this very readable story is the relationship between the author and his beloved but severely retarded younger sister.  Inexplicably, he allowed half his life to go by without visiting her, for which he felt guilty, and justifiably so.<br />He doesn't offer a reason for his neglect.  Are we supposed to assume it?  Are we supposed to play amateur armchair shrink and say something empty like \\"it was too painful for him\\"?  In an otherwise fairly well written book, I really can't get over the fact of his betrayal of the person he loved so, his complete abandonment of the love of his life, without any explanation.<br />I began reading the BOMC selection \\"Genius\\" right after this one.  It also begins with Shakespeare.  Both books class Shakespeare as the Babe Ruth of literature.  Don't we all?  Isn't that a cliche by now?  And yet, while much of Shakespeare's work is excellent, hasn't it occurred to anyone that some of the comedies are far short of excellent?  Some of the comedies are worse than I Love Lucy reruns.  Excuse me for being an iconoclast, but the emperor isn't always clothed.<br />And while we're iconoclasting at Shakespeare's expense, does it not occur to anyone that both Othello and King Lear are as lurid and in a way disgusting as the HBO series Oz, which by the way receives poor ratings from an ex con critic who claims that Oz is not at all realistic, and is way over the top.  Othello and King Lear are sickening stories.  They go beyond sadness, beyond tragedy, into a perversion of the psyche that I can do without.  A man strangling his faithful wife to death as a result of believing a liar, and a vain and foolish man ending up tortured by his own children.  This is sick stuff.  Sorry, it's too heavy and too sick for me.  The perversion and cruelty in these plays goes far beyond Hamlet and Macbeth, which are much happier by comparison, dealing only in murder.<br />As for The Merchant of Venice, which Bob Smith defends as being a reflection of the times rather than simply admitting that it is viciously racist (and was at one time titled The Jew of Venice), it must be admitted that if filthy racism is to be defended by the excuse that it represents its time and place, and therefore Shakespeare was not a racist, well then, you could almost make a case that Hitler was not a racist either, for the same reason.  As FDR said, if a Goebbels emerged on the streets of New York City in the 1930s or early 40s, NYC would have run as red with Jewish blood as Berlin.  So isn't it about time we stopped reflecting the prejudices of our time and place, and isn't it time we assigned responsibility to the individual for what he chose to write?  Shakespeare must be admitted to have been a vicious racist himself.  In that, he joins Chaucer, who was even worse, and of course was another \\"reflection of his time\\".<br />I resent the deification of Shakespeare, not because Merchant of Venice was racist, not because King Lear and Othello are disgusting, but because frankly I believe that more than a few of his comedies were as bad as the worst of the Beatle songs, and they weren't all brilliant.  Merchant, Lear, and Othello are all a lot better than some of those stupid comedies, and classing everything Shakespeare wrote as superior just nullifies one's credibility.  You're giving the \\"right\\" answer, but is it really the right answer?  Why not admit that he wrote a few \\"hits\\" that were pretty awful.  Okay, the girl is dressed as a guy again, okay this character is pretending to be someone else, alright already, seen that one already under another name.  Actually some of them would have fit in pretty well with I Love Lucy.s being a reflection of the times rather than simply admitting that it is viciously racist (and was at one time titled The Jew of Venice), it must be admitted that if filthy racism is to be defended by the excuse that it represents its time and place, and therefore Shakespeare was not a racist, well then, you could almost make a case that Hitler was not a racist either, for the same reason.

He just selected 100 people he wanted to write about.<br />So a better, more accurate title for this book would have been \\"100 People I Wanted To Write About\\".<br />He organizes the book oddly, breaking down his 100 geniuses into groups of 5 and 10.  The categories frankly make no sense at all to me.<br />I enjoyed Clifton Fadiman's book Lifetime Reading Plan.  It pointed the way to a lot of authors and books that I enjoyed, and a few I didn't.  I tend to be an iconoclast, and if everyone is telling me that Nathaniel Hawthorne was a genius and a brilliant writer, and I read several of his books and stories and find them pretty awful, I'll think less of the person who recommended him to me.<br />Hawthorne, who I believe was mediocre and overrated, is one of the geniuses in this book.  His magic-based short stories are both predictable and idiotic, and The Scarlet Letter ends foolishly with Hester abandoning her beloved daughter and grandchild in order to return to the scene of her shame.  Why would she do that?  Has she no loyalty to her family?  Is she a masochist?  No I think Hawthorne made her do it, despite all common sense.<br />It seems that if someone has a famous name, well he must be a genius.  After all, he's on the reading list in high school.  He must be brilliant.  Twenty million flies can't be wrong.<br />Harold Bloom is hard to read.  Criticisms of his writing style that appear in these reviews seem just about right to me.  I agree with what the other reviewers have said about him.<br />I began this book at the beginning, reading the intro til I couldn't take it anymore, then proceeding to Shakespeare and to one of my favorites - Cervantes.  I got something out of the Cervantes material, but then I read the next one, and the next, and decided to try to return the book to a local bookstore if they would take it.  I'll say I got it as a gift and have no receipt.<br />Needless to say, I think this book is not worth your money.  Get Fadiman's Lifetime Reading Plan instead.  That is a good one.<br />A better title for this book would be \\"The Meanderings Of A Windbag\\".tore if they would take it.

My favorite books on the subject are Michael Newton's Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls.  I tried this one because of its title Messages from the Masters, thinking maybe the book had a lot of information given directly by higher beings in Heaven.<br />From the beginning I was disappointed.  It seemed like there was a lot of filler and not much new substance.  The messages from the masters were disappointing.  Same tired old advice.  Be nonviolent.  Be loving.  Blah blah blah.<br />There were a few interesting parts in the book for me.  I have given it two stars, not just one.  But in general I had the impression that the author wanted another book out there, though he had nothing new to say.  And his title messages from the masters was a come-on that wasn't lived up to.<br />I'm sure I would agree with him on almost everything he says.  The way I see the current Iraq conflict, as our president tries his hardest to mobilize a peace-loving American public to want to invade a foreign country, is that although Saddam Hussein is about as low as they come, we haven't yet tried to sit down with him and talk face to face to work this out, not to mention the fact that we were the ones who gave him his chemical weapons in the first place, to use against Iran, and we were the ones who manufactured the anthrax that somehow got into the U.S. mail and killed a few people, so there is a huge element of hypocrisy here.<br />This philosophy of mine would mesh well with Brian Weiss, who is a peacenik like myself, though perhaps moreso.  In the final analysis, I really have no problem with kicking Saddam Hussein out of office, though for the life of me I can't justify our continued use of sanctions against his country, which kill so many innocent people for no reason.  They accomplished nothing good, and never will, so can them.  All of which, of course, has nothing to do with this book.  Well, actually, it does.  Think about it.  A little love and peace and caring.<br />One further complaint I have about this book is a comment the author makes, that we have no feelings in Heaven, that our souls have no feelings.  That is inhuman.  He's got to have that wrong.  He says all we have there is a sense of well being and love.  That sounds like a load ...to me.  It sounds like we're all drugged.  No feelings?  No real emotions other than some kind of la dee dah love?  If Heaven is as boring as that, no wonder people want to return to a world of pain and suffering and fear and worry and insecurity.  At least we can have some real feelings here.  But I don't believe the author.

First, I don't appreciate the \\"foreshadowing\\".  If a character is about to die, why not let that unfold with your story.  Don't let the cat out of the bag, pages in advance.  There's no reason for it.  Obviously the author knows that the character is going to die.  He's the one writing the book.  Let the reader find out as the story develops.<br />What is actually accomplished by telling us in advance that so and so is about to die?  It is depressing, and it ruins the dramatic power of the event.  If it has to happen, just let it happen.  Whatever reason the author has, I reject it.  It simply doesn't work to improve the story.  And it hurts the \\"reality\\" of the experience because it reminds me that the author obviously knows so and so has had it, because the author is spinning a story for me, so it makes the author too visible.<br />Another little complaint I have is that the big climax, which was good, was also too expected, too set up.  The big surprise was no surprise.  I knew all along what was going to happen to the bad guy, and by who.  It was just so obvious.  It was \\"telegraphed\\" as they say in boxing.  I think with a somewhat different approach, the surprise ending could have really been a surprise, an \\"oh my god!\\" moment.<br />I have a little trouble with Takeo's acts of magic.  How exactly does one go about splitting himself in two?  And if one can do that, how can he not know he has magical powers as he's growing up?  I don't buy it.  Clark Kent knew.  Was the magic really necessary?  Heightened senses, super hearing, probably would have been enough, along with ninja-like talents.  The magic events in the book leave you going \\"huh?\\".  I'm supposed to believe this?  They distance us from the characters.  To identify with a character you have to find his actions possible for you, if you were in his shoes with his genetics and training.<br />Okay, enough with the quibbles.  This is a good story and could make a great movie.  I really look forward to the movie, wouldn't miss it.<br />One element of a good adventure story is a good villain.  This story has one.  Perhaps not as good as Sauron, but then again, how many books have a villain as impressive as the one in Lord of the Rings.  This villain, an evil shogun, is a very good example of \\"might makes right\\", with no consideration for ethics.  You want to whack him yourself.<br />As in the movie version of Lord of the Rings, and to a lesser extent the book version, we are presented with martially heroic female characters in this book.  It seems like a trend.  Well, why not?  Movies and novels are so unrealistic to begin with, and they make their male heroes so damn tough, which is pure fiction as well, so why not give us impossibly tough females too?  There aren't a lot of movies or books that really focus on the relevant issues in our lives.  The majority of them are escapes from reality like this book.

There are nearly a thousand mini-biographies of players throughout history.  It really brings these old names to life, attaching personalities and events to names in the baseball encyclopedias.<br />Bill James stresses the player's performance in relation to the era and ballpark he played in.  Someone who hit .280 for the Dodgers in the 1960s is given more credit than someone who hit .300 in a hitter's park in a hitter's era.<br />He also emphasizes the value of walks, singles, and leadoff hitters.  These players rarely make it to the Hall of Fame, but they are the reason for Hack Wilson's incredible single season RBI record.  You've got to have men on base in order to drive in runs.  One of his points is that RBIs are overrated, and runs scored are underrated.<br />Though I enjoy his writing style, I have one complaint.  He often uses the phrase \\"as most of you know\\".  Usually it is followed by a fact I didn't know.  With only slight exaggeration, I'll make up an example.<br />As most of you know, Spook Jacobs had 131 hits in his rookie season for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1954.<br />So it leaves us thinking What??????????????????  We were supposed to know that?<br />Bill, most of us have jobs.  You don't.  You do baseball for a living.<br />Anyway, this is a very interesting book and Bill James is a brilliant baseball analyst and good storyteller except for that one annoying habit.	2003-02-02
US	39820807	R3VDHHUJ3OM5NQ	0743211375	124087136	From a Buick 8	Books	2	2	6	N	N	Formulaic	The subject of the book is interesting.  It is about a conduit between worlds.  The Buick transports people, animals and things to and from Earth.  It has a mind of its own, and apparently a rather evil one.  Why that should be is a mystery.  Why would a conduit between worlds be evil?  I guess it has to be if it is in a Stephen King novel.  A foolish answer, but the right one.  Compare it to an evil subway that viciously wants to take you downtown.<br />We are introduced to a number of characters, mostly policemen.  The two main characters are Sgt Sandy Dearborn (our hero) and young Ned Wilcox (our sympathy figure).  You need a hero, you need a villain, and you need a damsel in distress.  Ned is the damsel in distress.  Instead of being a female, he is the son of a great cop who died in the line of duty.  Is that enough for you?  Can you love him and fear for him now?  You better.  Otherwise, King has no book.<br />We are informed that one might possibly cheat the evil Buick by tying a rope around one's waist and having some husky cops holding the end of the rope.  Then if you are sucked into the vortex, you will be held back by the rope.  Those are the rules of the game.<br />To our amazement, the book builds to a climax when Pretty Polly, I mean Ned, is in danger of being sucked into a Buick, and it is up to hero Sandy to pull him back.  Let me tell you, it's touch and go there for a while.<br />Stephen King should be ashamed of himself for writing this predictable and formulaic story.  He took an interesting concept, made it sinister because that is what he does, and pushed it through the obvious, leading to the obvious conclusion.<br />This was my first Stephen King book.  I'm not impressed with his writing.  Or maybe he's just getting lazy.  Maybe his other books are better.  Other reviewers think so.	2003-01-24

What I like best about it is its sense of fantasy and fun.  As a moral play, as a lesson against military force, it becomes ponderous, depressing, and ultimately pointless.  Like Tolstoy in War And Peace, T.H. White is a much better storyteller than he is a philosopher.  I didn't appreciate the monologue or lecture at the end of the book, whether in White or Tolstoy.<br />We start out with a story so light and imaginative and fun that it could be called a children's story.  And as that, it's excellent.  Merlin transforms young King Arthur into various animals and he communicates with his fellow animals, all of which illustrate traits of humans.  For example, as an ant the child is exposed to mindless militarism.<br />The story of the love triangle between Arthur, Guenever, and Lancelot is puzzling, maybe even infuriating.  Arthur is not emotionally upset about his wife's betrayal.  On the contrary, it is a love fest between the three of them (not physically).  What is going on?  In T.H. White's fantasy world there are no deep dark emotions of jealousy and possessiveness.  That's nice, I guess, for him.  But the only way I can understand a world without jealousy and possessiveness is as a world without feeling.  If you don't give a damn, you don't give a damn.  It all feeds into the author's philosophy that we should all subscribe to John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" song and give up all our possessions.  Yeah, okay.  Just let me keep this here ashtray, and, umm, I think I'll need my calculator.<br />One of the most frustrating things about this book is Arthur's loss of strength and sense at the end.  He becomes so weak that he won't even protect his wife from \\"the law\\".  Oh well, if they want to burn her at the stake, well, I donno, I guess ....  It is no fun to read about a weak, senseless sap.  Was Arthur not in a position to make the laws more humane?  Are we to follow laws that lead to cruelty?  I don't enjoy wallowing in someone else's misery, particularly when that someone else has the strength and brains of a waterlogged paper towel.<br />So I believe that the strength of this book is its imagination, its light and its fun, and there is a lot of it.  The depressing parts, evidently judged essential to get a point across, or else God knows why they are there, just fall flat.  In fact, the book itself just falls flat.  The ending is unsatisfactory.  You may have a tendency to decide that the book is famous and therefore must be great, and hell, we're not entitled to another happy ending all the time, but I have to disagree that this ending is good.  No, I think it is pretty lame.<br />White's argument for us at the end is that the Have Nots will always make war because they want what the Haves have.  I disagree.  The Have Nots of this world don't have the wherewithal to make war.  War is usually Haves trying to get at what other Haves have, or Haves trying to steal whatever the Have Nots happen to have.

I listen to progressive radio, ... in New York, and whenever they mention the Middle East they slam the Jews and Israel, and they sympathize with the Arabs.  I feel like telling them to read Exodus by Leon Uris.  Get the other side.  The author beautifully presents history from the Jewish point of view, from the Holocaust to the prison camps on Cyprus to Jewish immigration to Palestine to the Jewish conquest of the desert and conversion of it into farmland, to the U.N. vote to allow the Jews their own homeland (since no country on Earth was willing to accept Hitler's Jews, thus sealing their fate in the death camps), to the Arab attempt to exterminate the Jews and finish what Germany started, to Israel's victory in the first war against a union of Arab invaders.  This book also explains that the Palestinian refugee problem was manufactured by the Arabs, not by the Jews, and is hypocritically exploited by Arabs for propaganda value when in fact no Arab nation would allow the Palestinians to live among them.  One criticism I have of this book is that it leaves the reader despising Arabs and British, and even a Jewish reader has to be left thinking they couldn't have been so completely evil, they must have had something to say for themselves.  You walk away from this book thinking that Arabs are insane.  Well, let's say they are overly propagandized to hate the Jews and leave it at that.  The Mideast crisis will never be solved until the hateful propaganda is stopped.  When every Arab country drums up vicious hatred against the Jews, similar to Goebbels and Hitler, it spells eternal trouble.	2002-12-22

I came away from this book with the impression that iridology is in its infancy, and that the definitive text isn't this one.<br />The author himself says the same.  He tells us that there is so much more to learn about iridology, and that we are not to trust our own observations until we have been at it for several years and have studied hundreds of pairs of eyes.<br />Wouldn't the definitive text give us something to take away with us, something we can use?<br />When I looked up iridology on the internet I was referred to a website that said that a group of iridologists was put to the test, including the author of this book, and that they failed to accurately report on the health of the test subjects.<br />I am very suspicious of the &quot;quack busters&quot;, who are almost always deceptive and worthless.  But in this case, the report only led me to give more credence to the author's own expressed doubts.<br />What the book does offer is a background in iridology.  Now I know what it is about and I have some idea of how to go about doing it.  The first thing you'd better do is buy some equipment to photograph eyes and blow them up to a size you can deal with.  No matter how long I stare at my own eyes in a mirror, I don't see a damn thing.	2002-11-17

I like the idea of comparing players of different eras to each other.  For example, how would dead ball slugger Homerun Baker compare to Babe Ruth and on to Barry Bonds?  This book gives us an answer, and to some degree it seems valid.  I wouldn't have used the particular methods that this author did, but I do agree that Ruth's homerun accomplishments were superior to Bonds's in this age of swatting souped up golf balls over the fence.  But the fictional recreation of imaginary playoffs seemed like a bad idea, particularly since the author inserted a random chance factor in his results.  Why?  Why should a reader care what random results were arrived at?  The book didn't hold my interest, though I think the premise isn't bad.	2002-10-12

The others were fine so far, but this one is so terribly boring to me.  It is rare that I will put down a book before finishing it, but in this case I had to.  It is about a car trip across country.  No, there are no interesting anecdotes in it.  No there are no interesting people to meet.  The most interesting thing here is that yet another car or truck broke down and had to be towed by the Militor.  Reading the other reviews on this site I see that others enjoyed the book very much.  To me it was painfully boring.	2002-10-12

I wrote 3 other reviews this afternoon and gave out 1, 2 and 3 stars. This is my highest of the day.<br />Betsy Carter gives us a look at her world of magazine publishing.  You get to be a fly on the wall, to some degree, looking inside a few magazine offices.<br />My initial reaction is - what a lucky woman she is to have been in such a creative field.  I would have loved it.  She doesn't show her own abilities here as an editor.  I get the feeling that either she doesn't think particularly highly of herself as an editor or she just doesn't want to show off.  It's always someone else who is brilliant and talented, never herself.<br />Some of the hardships in her life are pretty devastating.  Others are typical.  My life has its own hardships.  Hers are very believable.<br />I think that anyone's life, well written, should make an interesting book or two or three.  Betsy Carter does a good job on her own life.<br />I don't know if she realizes it, but she comes off as Miss Rich Thing, simply by the fact of who some of her dates were.  Sometimes you feel bad for her when her personal life doesn't go as she'd like, but then again, would she date a guy who wasn't rich and/or handsome?	2002-10-12
US	39820807	R2ZC41JMC5WUSW	0385182848	418919075	The Hidden Game of Baseball	Books	4	7	7	N	Y	Generally excellent and informative	Overall, this is a valuable book to a baseball historian.  I learned what the actual lefty righty variations are in batting averages, homers, and walks.  In other words, how lefty pitching affects lefty hitting, etc.  And I learned how people hit when they have worked themselves into different ball-strike counts.  The best batting averages come at the count of 3-1.  There is a lot of emphasis on fielding range as measured by how many balls the fielders managed to get to.<br />In such a comprehensive book you want to believe everything in it and accept it as some kind of Bible.  But you'd better not.  The book has a few flaws in it.<br />For example, it ranks Sandy Koufax as a non-entity.  While admitting that his pitching was good, it rips him to shreds because he couldn't hit, and wasn't a great fielder either.  My reaction is so what if he couldn't hit.  And as for his fielding, first of all, when you strike out so many hitters you don't get as many chances to field the ball, and second of all, pitchers handle so few batted balls to begin with that the sampling isn't that significant.  If your system ends up saying Koufax was nothing, there is something wrong with your system.  Koufax was among the elite of baseball history.  I rank him as the second best pitcher who ever lived, behind Walter Johnson.  He was God on the mound, and you don't just brush that off.  He was more devastating than Randy Johnson.  He had the best curve ball I've ever seen.  If you went against him, you lost.  The SF Giants didn't want to match Marichal against Koufax.  Why waste Marichal on an automatic loss.  Believe me, they would have matched Marichal against anyone else.  To put my comments in perspective, I was never a Dodger fan.	2002-10-12

But the baby does not become heir to wealth.  The baby is taken in by the gardener, a young single man just out of jail.  The news isn't all bad though.  The man loves his new baby and takes great care of her.<br />How to judge this book?  By level of interest?  By depth of characters?  It deserves a passing grade.  It held my interest.  Several of the characters are memorable.  It didn't deeply affect me or teach me anything new.<br />In a few places the author's grammar was awkwardly correct.  She repeats the words &quot;had had&quot; over and over in some chapters.  My reaction was - yes, it looks correct, but God is it awkward to keep repeating that.<br />I agree with another reviewer that the ending is a bust.  It makes me say &quot;if you don't care, why should I?&quot;  If your heart is broken, is it really so easy to just walk?	2002-10-12

So the focus is on dealing with the grief of losing a loved one.<br />One of the unique issues that he deals with is that suffering, whether physical or emotional, is worth going through, because of the rewards it brings in the afterlife.  I wish he went into some detail about what those rewards are.<br />He is also the first author I've read who makes the point that the souls want very much to communicate with us.  And he brings a unique interpretation of suicide, which is the most humane and gentle interpretation I've seen.<br />This is a very compassionate and uplifting book.  I give him credit for taking on the religious right squarely, with a right cross, by saying flat out that there is no devil.  Many Americans, particularly in the south, believe strongly in the existence of the devil, and George Anderson doesn't mince words when he tells them that they are dead wrong.<br />There are so many books dealing with subjects of marginal interest.  This one deals with what will happen to you after you die.  And George Anderson definitely seems on the level.	2002-09-13

It teaches you about reincarnation.  There are about three dozen cases of reborn children described here.<br />I am not taken in by a lot of nonsense.  I have an astronomical IQ and a scientific mind, and I am convinced by this author and this book.  I threw another book on this subject in the garbage where I felt it belonged (the best seller by Beatrice Eadie) but this Carol Bowman book is a keeper.<br />If you think that you know better, that reincarnation is impossible, well, you're not as all-knowing as you think you are.<br />I used to say that I didn't know what position to take on the abortion issue because we don't know what effect an abortion has on the baby.  Is it destroyed?  No it isn't.  The baby is just as alive in Heaven as it was before.  It has just been denied the opportunity to be born in that woman at that time.  It can try again later or go to someone else.<br />On the other hand, sometimes the baby changes its mind and decides not to be born.  That results in a miscarriage or stillborn.<br />Children between the ages of two and seven sometimes have memories of their last life.  They'll remember \\"when I was big before\\" or \\"my other mommy\\".  Often, the people in the past life are also in the present life or in the same family.  You can literally be your own grandpa.  You can be both your mother's mom and your mother's son.<br />There may be a physical connection between the two lives.  You may be born with scars or deformities similar to those inflicted on your prior body at the time of death.  You may look the same in both lives.<br />Isn't it wonderful that truths like these can be found in your local bookstore or here on the net.	2002-06-22

This is not it, but apparently the definitive bio hasn't been written yet and won't be.<br />The key question has got to be why this vicious moron hated the Jews.  Anyone can guess, but a good biography should know.  Nobody does.  There are plenty of guesses out there.<br />This book does shed light on why the German people treated the Jews as they did.  The Jews were a disliked and defenseless minority.  Bullies aren't out looking for a true test of manhood and courage.  They like to outnumber their victims, and to find victims who are unable to effectively fight back.  That is why most attacks by Germans against Jews featured anywhere from 3 to 1,000 young German males attacking an old Jewish woman.  A more accurate term for bullies would be bully-cowards.  It would have been more impressive if lone Germans attacked groups of 3 to 1,000 Jewish men.  No such luck.<br />Ian Kershaw lets us in to a world that once existed, where Germans acted with cruelty or indifference towards their fellow human beings.  It is utterly sickening.	2002-06-18

This would require a clear explanation correlating different astrological events to their associated medical conditions, hopefully in a systematic and complete way.  I was disappointed, and I will be returning the book to Amazon.<br />What I found here was the \\"case study\\" copout.  In hindsight we know, for example, that Arnold Schwarzenegger is very strong and has heart trouble.  I really am not impressed by a recital of far too many astrological details about his chart coming to the conclusion, somehow, that he is very strong and has heart trouble.<br />I appreciate directness, simplicity, clarity, and organization.  None of that can be found in this book.	2002-04-07

Vitamins were placed here by the creator(s), to keep us healthy.  The drugs \\"pushed\\" by MDs were created by Frankenstein in a lab, and frankly, Frankenstein barely understood one tenth of what he was doing, which explains all those side effects.<br />To give you a taste of this useful book, Vitamin B3 (niacin or niacinamide) is far more important and necessary than we thought it was.  The author goes into detail explaining the things that B3 can do for us.<br />The section on pyroluriacs is new to me, and fascinating.  If you don't know what a pyroluriac is, you may want to find out here.  It is a condition verifiable by scientific testing, and the symptoms are correctable using various nutrients.<br />This book gives a very good explanation of so many vitamins and minerals.

If you ever used the self-cleaning cycle of an oven you noticed that any liquid that spilled in the oven was turned into an ash.  Inside your body, the parts of food that went through the digestive process and were not digested were turned into an ash (not including fibers that just passed through undigested).  The ash left behind after eating high protein food is strongly acidic.  Strong acids can be tolerated in the stomach but they can't be tolerated in the urinary tract - they would cause severe burns there.  So they must be neutralized.  If you have reserves of sodium in your body you will be able to neutralize the acid easily.  But if you don't, your body must take sodium or calcium from other duties and apply them to neutralizing acid.  This loss of sodium or calcium hurts you in the long run.  It is the author's contention that if you eat foods that produce an alkali ash and cut back on protein foods, you will be healthy.  So eat those fruits and veggies, and don't load up on the biggest steak on the menu.  To learn more, get the book.	2002-03-23

There is a wealth of information here about herbs, minerals, vitamins, amino acids, and many other topics of interest to alternative health readers.  The point we keep returning to is that our medical problems are caused by allergies, and that allergies can be cured by taking antidotes.<br />Muscle Response Testing (MRT) is used to determine what we are allergic to and exactly how to cure the allergy.  But the MRT system is so hard to believe.  It is like tapping into a realm of magic.  And yet everything in this book takes you back to this unusual method of testing.<br />Do you need Vitamin C?  Place a Vitamin C pill in your right hand, press it to your solar plexus.  Extend your left arm.  Your doctor then presses down on your extended left arm.  Is your resistance strong?  Is your arm rigid?  Try it again, holding two vitamin pills this time.  Is your extended arm stronger this way?<br />Being open minded, I gave it a try even though it seems unscientific.  Holding different amounts of pills did have varying effects on my thoughts.  Does this test rely on the fact that the person being tested knows what he is holding and this affects how strong his resistance will be?  Will he then subconsciously try to satisfy the tester by giving an appropriate amount of resistance?  Do the results really tell what your body needs, or do they tell what you think you need?<br />One of the most valuable bits of advice in this book is that your state of mind deeply affects your health, and that worrying and being afraid will not do you any good.  When you feel this way you are advised to say a prayer.  This will re-focus you and turn your negativity around.<br />The author is obviously very knowledgeable, and I believe him when he says he has helped many patients.	2002-03-23

I like the immensity of it.  It is nothing short of a Biblical struggle between good and evil.  And yet it isn't just a \\"shoot-em-up\\" because the heroes have chosen to destroy power, not to wield it.<br />The title character, the Lord of the Rings, is a hideous creature named Sauron who is the most powerful living thing in \\"Middle Earth\\".  He has concentrated much of his power into a magic ring, which has been lost many centuries, but the ring has finally been found by a small \\"hobbit\\".  If Sauron recovers it, his awesome power will be multiplied and he will be unstoppable.  He will rule the world in Hitler fashion.<br />The heroes of the free world are the wizard Gandalf, mankind's most valiant Aragorn, powerful and magical elf leaders Elrond and Galadriel, and little hobbit Frodo Baggins who holds the One Ring of power.<br />The writer's style is often Biblical, but sometimes it is geared to a young readership, playful.

I love a Hawaiian and I was so angry reading about the way Hawaiians were treated by the missionaries and other Americans.  In fact I put the book down rather than continue to read about those fool missionaries, but my dear Hawaiian told me to keep reading.<br />The book is organized in waves - the wave of Bora Borans coming to Hawaii, and why they came.  The wave of missionaries bringing their damn fool ideas but still doing some good by eliminating human sacrifice in Hawaii.  The wave of Chinese and why they came.  The wave of Japanese from Hiroshima.  And finally the closing section about post-war Hawaii.  I would have liked another section about the wave of Filipinos and Puerto Ricans, but they aren't in the book.  Something about Hawaii makes me think in terms of waves...<br />My favorite part of the book is the Bora Borans.  It is the only part that doesn't bother us with those damn missionaries and their annoying descendants.  I think it was the author's intention to have the readers despise these missionary descendants.  You can tell just by their repetitive names.  Every damn one is named Whipple Janders Hoxworth Hale.<br />James Michener is a storyteller, not a historian.  In this book you can see that he is also a Republican-hating Democrat, which isn't a bad thing to be, not that the Democrats are anything to brag about.  There are many people to despise in this book, many people who strain your patience.  In fact, the one point that other reviewers on this site seem to have missed is that the characters are usually infuriating, annoying, stupid.<br />The star of the book is probably the Chinese lady Char Nyuk Tsin who was a kind of Mother Teresa to the lepers and also a canny business woman running a family empire.  But the most lovable characters are the Hawaiians, like Teroro, Marama, Kelolo and Malama.<br />As far as plot is concerned, there are two stories that stand out.  The leper colony is an excellent section.  So is the Bora Bora tale.  The weakness of the book is that so much time is spent on the business shenanigans of the missionary descendants and immigrants.
