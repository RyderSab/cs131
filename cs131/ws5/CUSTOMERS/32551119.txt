The true value in this book is the insight into your partners' psyche along with your own. So often sex books are full of techniques, rub this while blowing sexily on that and then so on and so forth. This book is entirely from a different perspective, a more thoughtful perspective steeped in the reality of long term relationships. The title of chapter one pretty much sets the tone for the whole book, \\"Great Sex Begins with the Right Attitude\\".<br /><br />If you want more from a sex book than just the mechanical techniques of specific manipulations I whole hearted recommend, Secrets of Sexual Ecstasy. The authors tell you from the very beginning that sexual ecstasy is ambiguous because ecstasy is individual somewhat like a person's preference in any other matter aside from sex. Here is an incredible volume of knowledge every couple should read if for no other reason but to gain insight on how your personal reactions affect your partners outlook on sex and you. So often we, as people, are too involved with our own emotions to really tap into the emotions of our partner and this book really helps to open your eyes at how your partner reacts to your choices and circumstances. I don't want to discourage you from reading this book talking solely on the incredible insight because you will find many answers to things never discussed in other sex books.<br /><br />Of course, Secrets to Sexual Ecstasy gently moves you through the idea that with new relationships when the sex is still very brand new are far different from long term relationships where lust is often something you have to re-invigorate from time to time. This book helps people realize that changes in a relationship doesn't mean its over but that with change brings both challenges and rewards that new relationships lack. Hopefully with a long-term relationship your comfort in sex is far better than in the beginning giving you a great foundation to create ecstasy for you and your partner.<br /><br />Unlike lots of other books on sex this book concentrates on the most important sex organ, the brain. The brain is your sexual epicenter. All your preconceived ideas and notions are in the brain so it's safe to say all your inhibitions, attitudes, fantasies, and holdovers from childhood lie in your brain. So the first order in this book is to address your attitudes on sex and pleasure. Once you have addressed some of your own personal issues regarding sex the book takes you into your relationship to help you reconnect or strengthen the bond with your partner so you can achieve sexual ecstasy.<br /><br />Now that you've taken care of your brains attitude and resolved some of the relationship issues that hold you back from sexual ecstasy Secrets to Sexual Ecstasy does take you down the road to orgasm and how to maximize your sexual experience. One of the great points the book makes is that intercourse is not necessarily the best outcome to ecstasy and I have to agree. Some of the best sex I ever had was immersed in the simple delight of touch and exploration of course it ended in orgasm but not necessarily penetration. I typically think that the traditional thought that all great sex is penetrative sex is complete crap. Sometimes there is a freedom that comes from knowing personal performance isn't an issue as much as the other person's immersion in the pleasure you give them.<br /><br />Many a book skip a lot of important information on sexual barriers such as sexual dysfunction, relationship issues, and health or age related conditions that can hinder sexual ecstasy but this book addresses many issues that you'll find helpful. Often people have an avoidance of discussing such issues but they do exist and from time to time everyone has experienced some degree of lapse in sexual response or lapse in desire and this book addresses every known problem. It even offers answers and yes techniques to such problems as performance anxiety, pleasure anxiety, medical/chemical issues that hinder performance and desire, sexual aversion, premature ejaculation erectile dysfunction, latent ejaculation, painful intercourse, and the list goes on. You probably don't have any of the issues listed or maybe you do; regardless, this book offers real avenues of solution for dysfunctions that affect both men and women.<br /><br />By far this is the most helpful book on sex and issues regarding sexual enjoyment. You'll enjoy the many accounts of people with issues and how they overcame them along with the very helpful words of the authors and the many contributors to the book. If at any time you want to expand your reading on any particular subject the authors' offer an extensive bibliography and resource section.

This book was written and published by Taylor. Mind you the woman knows a great deal about fellatio and the book is highly informative if you can get past the fact that this book lacks a certain amount of eye candy I've become accustomed to. How do I begin: the cover, the numerous photos that are far from publishing quality, the layout of the book, and then there is the writing. All of which is distracting to a very informative book on one of my favorite acts.<br /><br />Taylor covers several wonderful things in this book but I was distracted by the delivery. Are looks important? When it comes to a book, it is to me. The message is good but if I can't concentrate due to the poor quality of the book what's the point? I just think this book had so much potential.<br /><br />All that said, there is great stuff in this book that is good. My favorite is putting a condom on with just my mouth. Taylor pretty much covers everything from deep throating to popping candy all with her own brand of wit and slang. It's a great education but the delivery could use some work.<br /><br />I gave this book three stars for the information it contains but couldn't give it any more.<br /><br />girldiver:)	2005-06-30

This book is an excellent education for any woman or man, for that matter, who is interested in experiencing female dominance. This is not a simple overview of female dominance or bdsm techniques but a true manual that takes you through the evolution of becoming a Mistress and the enacting of fantasy with your male partner. If you are new to the concept of female dominance this is an excellent book to guide you through the pleasure and pain of being the ultimate Nursemaid, Governess, Queen, Amazon, or Goddess. The book is broken into three main sections: Becoming a Mistress, The Mistress in Action, and The Five Archetypal Fantasies.<br /><br />Becoming a Mistress brings light to idea of female dominance and the pleasure that can come from command while also discussing the psychological aspects of dominance and finding a partner to explore your fantasies. I enjoyed this section immensely since so many factors concerning personal guilt and relationships are addressed in regards to female dominance. If you're new to the sensual art of dominance you will gather a great deal of self-awareness and understanding in this section concerning bdsm and female dominance<br /><br />The Mistress in Action begins the real sexual play of dominance between you and your male partner. From the language of dominance to the ties that bind you'll learn some basics that you can expand on with additional reading. This is an excellent book for the novice domme. Once you and our submissive discover specific items that are enjoyable I highly recommend SM101 by Jay Wiseman to explore more techniques and in-depth understanding of BDSM.<br /><br />The Five Archetypal Fantasies are The Nursemaid, The Governess, The Queen, The Amazon, and the Goddess. Each archetype is outlined from elements of the fantasy, skills needed in the fantasy, enacting the perfect scenario, and variations of each fantasy. If you're unsure how to begin this section will eliminate all doubts. This is a step by step how to from what you should be thinking to create the fantasy to what to wear.<br /><br />Another great part of this book is that conflict between fantasy choice between you and your submissive is discussed and addressed thoroughly so that everybody wins so you can move on to the sensual art of female dominance. As I mentioned I don't gravitate to dominance but if I ever needed to help someone fulfill their fantasy to be dominated by a Nursemaid, Governess, Queen, Amazon, or Goddess I know exactly how to take control now that I've read The Mistress Manual.<br /><br />girldiver:)ons of each fantasy.

What expectations does the Kama Sutra hold for you? Myself, I had little expectations when I bought this book but I am pleasantly surprised by what I've taken away from my reading of The Bedside Kama Sutra.<br /><br />The book illustrates 23 positions for pleasure and passion but you don't have to do all twenty-three to feel like you got your moneys worth.<br /><br />First things first, this book is not an exercise guide to sex. If you buy this book to execute every move to a perfect climax you'll more than likely be disappointed.  Beautifully illustrated this guide is a wonderful addition to any sexual/erotic personal library. Holistic in approach to the very intimate connection between two people this guide offers a unique incorporation of the senses of sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell to help you create sensuality and to enhance your sexual experience.<br /><br />Of course the positions are the main event but they are preluded by a section called \\"centre yourself\\" that helps you explore all your senses to maximize your personal experience. Once you've recharged or reclaimed your senses with the first section you can take a good look at each position in the book.<br /><br />Each position is featured over multiple pages with step by step text to help you perform the position and multiple photographs illustrating the progressive movement with in the position. Also, there is written commentary to help you understand the position and aid to your understanding of what to expect from the position. Through out the book are translated text from the original Kama Sutra that gives you some insight into this ancient highly sexualized Indian culture. Many of the translated text cover topics that are controversial even today.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed this book but I didn't use this book as your traditional sexual guide. I read the book and assessed my own ability and the ability of my partner. Once I did that I incorporated specific aspects from some of the positions that interested me. I'm not sure any one couple can perform every position with in this book. You must take into consideration your own physical ability along with your partners' ability and realize that many of the positions in this book require a great deal of strength and flexibility by both the man and woman.<br /><br />One of the many reasons to purchase The Bedside Kama Sutra is the wonderful imagery created by the photographer, the two featured attractive models, and the sensual subject depicted with dignified class.<br /><br />girldiver:)sitions that interested me.

There are a multitude of books on sexual technique and sexuality but often many books are hype rather than help. I have found in reading any Lou Paget book to be both inspiring and helpful. Lou Paget is the author of several books on sexuality. She does concentrate on heterosexual sex but most all the information contained in her books can be utilized for alternative sexual lifestyles.<br /><br />The book is organized into ten very informative chapters:<br /><br />1. The Kama Lou Tra<br /><br />2. Beyond the Bedroom<br /><br />3. The Art of Kissing<br /><br />4. Safety is Essential<br /><br />5. To Lube or Not to Lube<br /><br />6. Give that Man a Hand<br /><br />7. Blowing His.....Mind!<br /><br />8. The Outer Limits<br /><br />9. Coming Together At Last<br /><br />10. Pearls and Other Passionate Playthings<br /><br />The Kama Lou Tra concentrates on how the author came to teach sexuality seminars and writing her books on sexual techniques. One of the many reasons I continue to buy and read books by Lou Paget is her writing style: clear, intelligent, and friendly advice. Her books are always very helpful and written very well. Never is it too complicated to follow or understand and always in a friendly round table tone.<br /><br />The rest of the book gives explicit details on subjects of pure pleasure. I must comment that in the second chapter, Beyond the Bedroom is incredibly insightful for women. I really loved the fact that Lou took the time to not only tell about specific techniques in her book but asked men what they really thought of sex, women, and what they consider the most important attribute to have in a sexual partner. As a woman who loves sex I must say I have found that the statements made on page 29 paragraph one and two under \\"Bodily Bliss\\" are right on.<br /><br />Beyond that all the other chapters are great and full of lots of great ideas and techniques. The one reason I bought and read this book is for chapter 6, Give the Man a Hand. I am very fond of incorporating hand techniques into my lovemaking. Let face it, good sex isn't just about getting to the ultimate finishing line but putting your whole body into the mutual adoration of each other and that just might mean you'll use your hands in the most pleasurable ways. My favorite of her many hand techniques is `Ode to Bryan'.<br /><br />Of course, there are lots of other great things in this book that include positions, kissing, oral techniques, helpful hints, hand jobs, toys, and a whole chapter on lube (a whole chapter!). I loved the trivia/helpful information called Secrets from Lou's Archives sprinkled through out the book.<br /><br />A Great book for your wonderful days and nights.<br /><br />girldiver:)s into my lovemaking.

It's disturbing to read complete submission between two people and you think to yourself you'd never turn over so much control to another person but you never really know until you live it.<br /><br />The simplicity of this book is what really makes it complicated and even more compelling to read.

What's it like to be Tristan Taormino? Read `True Lust' and you'll have a better perspective of who she is and what it's like to be a Perky Sex Diva for an entire generation. All the essays and commentary are relatively short but each one tells a story of sexual growth and exploration. Topics range from getting a lap dance to group sex. She even talks about transgender and what it's like to be a bisexual woman.<br /><br />Yes, the book is provocative but encompasses an honesty that communicates the importance of exploring ones own sexual identity as caring adults and yes acting responsibly. With in `True Lust' you'll laugh, you'll be aroused, and also find yourself mindful of an alternative culture of women and men. Written very well I enjoyed the upbeat and thoughtful views depicted in this book.<br /><br />Of course, this isn't a book for everyone. You do need to possess a little curiosity, a little open mindedness to accept that there are others in the world who like things that are extremely spicy in bed, out of bed, and lifesyle in general.<br /><br />This book certainly does hold many adventures in sex, porn, and possibly perversion.<br /><br />girldiver:)	2005-01-31

Written by the founders of the store Toys in Babeland this book is truly an uninhibited guide to erotic toys.  Written in modern day language this book is a great reference guide, especially if you happen to be too shy to walk into your local sexual aid store.  If you don't live in a very big town you probably will not find a store with an informed staff that can show you what's available and help you pick out a toy to meet your needs so this book is a perfect guide.<br /><br />I must confess, in the past I've never been interested in toys so this book was quite refreshing to read. It gives you a great introduction to the toys available on the market. There are ten chapters that cover sexual anatomy (briefly), sexual expression & communication, vibrators, dildos & strap-ons, toys for men, lubricant (a whole chapter, WOW), bondage & domination, SM, and safety. Each chapter gives you, in detail everything you need to know about the highlighted toy pictured from what it's made of, to how to care for the toy. They even tell you the history of such toys and how to use each one featured in the book.<br /><br />This book is not only aesthetically pleasing to the eye with its colorful still life photographs of sexual toys but its overall design, texture, and feel. It's just heavy enough to warrant the price I paid for it, every page is glossy & smooth, and the writing is forward & fun. Where else will you see a section titled, `Dildos are for everyone'.<br /><br />Oh, before I forget, my favorite thing in the whole book was the \\"Wondrous Vulva Puppet\\" by House O'Chicks. It so intrigued me and it was beautiful.<br /><br />It's a great book full of fun stuff but with all that great info no where did I see how to use those `ben wa' balls I got for Christmas, but don't let that stop you from reading this book. It's great.<br /><br />girldiver:)	2005-01-10

So maybe you're a fan of Vivid Entertainment and especially the Vivid Girls (Jenna, Tawny, Kira, Briana, Dasha, Mercedez, Sunrise, and Savanna)! If so this book is for you.<br /><br />Truly, I knew very little about Vivid Entertainment when I bought this book. I suppose I was intrigued as to what a \\"Porn Star\\" can really tell me about improving my sex life. Sure they have sex everyday on film but really what kind of information can they offer that will help me or others have a truly fulfilled sex life? Actually, they do manage to communicate the concept of fantasy via porn as a sexual aid and enhancement to any individuals or couples sex life.<br /><br />Although, there are gems of first hand experience and information I felt as if this book is mostly a vehicle to market and publicized Vivids' number one product, \\"Porn\\". Oh, and the Vivid Girls of course.<br /><br />First and foremost the book is hansom and has a center section of glossy pics of the Vivid Girls. Also, let me just mention that the book is well written with the help of Dan Anderson and Maggie Berman. Each section does give you some interesting information along with a section of script/intro of a currently available Porn Film. Then lots of personal experiences and preferences from the Vivid Girls concerning sex.<br /><br />Oh, yes, let me also mention the book is littered or adorned with small sections called, 'Vivid Girl Favorits' and 'Vivid Girl Tips' that were quite interesting and worth reading.<br /><br />All in all, I gave the book four stars for its forward approach of sex and film, its organization, and overall presentation. You might not learn a great deal on how to improve your own sex life but then you might. Anyway, you'll certainly get a lot of forthright personal experiences that can be considered crude erotica or you can consider the delivery of personal information as your own personal one on one interview with the Vivid Girls of Entertainment.<br /><br />I thought the book intimate and well done but I won't be running to the adult video store anytime soon.<br /><br />girldiver:)video store anytime soon.    girldiver:)	2004-12-14

Anyway, the book is full of facts, techniques, and some common sense advice when it comes to pleasing your man!<br /><br />The book is broken down into ten chapters, an appendix, and a bonus letter at the end of the book. In 152 pages Sadie Allison covers everything you can do for your man with great caricature illustrations. The greatest message of the book is do it with 'enthusiasm' and I whole heartedly AGREE!

Set in post WWII American, Nobokov writes of the contrast between the new American of post World War II and the old world European culture that exists between Lolita and Humbert.<br /><br />At times Lolita came across as much older to me than 12 years old but then again I had to remember who was telling this story, Humbert Humbert, of course. I am sure if Lolita were the narrator a much different and painful book would have emerged. Humbert Humbert describes with ease and affliction his darkest desires and realities while painting a darkly comedic and justified point of view of his time with Lolita.<br /><br />I am always in awe of such wonderful writing as `Lolita' depicts.

Mike would like Justin's natural physical abilities while Justin longs for the simple happy family life that Mike possesses.<br /><br />The novel is both entertaining and fast paced set in the present day atmosphere of collegiate football. A football enthusiast will enjoy the detailed descriptions of what it takes to play division one college football and a non-enthusiast will enjoy the emotional dynamics and personal struggle of each cousin to attain their dreams.<br /><br />I found the interpersonal struggles to be over all intriguing and the real question to this story is not 'What If' but 'How much are you willing to sacrifice for the ultimate opportunity?'<br /><br />girldiver:)	2004-09-21

While browsing the books and nutritional literature I picked up this brochure. I actually had some knowledge of essential fatty acids through other reading but wanted to know more with out having to read a 300 page book so this 32 page brochure gave me just what I needed. Of course, if you want a more in-depth discussion on essential fatty acids by all means go get a big big book but for just an overview this does the trick.<br /><br />I was amazed by the benefits and function of essential fatty acids on our health. There are basically three essential fatty acids that the human body needs: linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid. They are considered essential because human bodies do not make them and we must obtain them through diet. Most people are unaware of how important essential fatty acids are to good health. Essential fatty acids help in almost all facets of our bodies from strengthening cell and capillary structures to lowering triglyceride levels. Fortunately, essential fatty acids are found in both plant and animal sources. Two forms of essential fatty acids are omega-3 and omega-6. Some good sources of omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids are black currant seed oil, borage oil, salmon oil, flax seed oil, evening primrose oil, and cold-water fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel.<br /><br />The brochure also talks about the dangers of fried foods and using cooking oil along with the diet imbalance our society faces through mass production of our food sources today. If nothing else this brochure will open your eyes to the fact that most of our society eat too many processed foods, which in turn create nutritional imbalances that attribute to poor over all health.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great start to learning the important benefits and function of essential fatty acids and a resource guide to learning more about - Good Fats.<br /><br />girldiver:)	2004-08-16

I really wasn't prepared to actually learn anything from this book. I truly thought this book would be a recap of what I already knew. I was wrong! Like a lot of women, I was guilty of over-simplifying the male sexual cycle. This book addressed many misconceptions women have about the male sexual cycle and male orgasm. It also touches on the unique individuality of every man; just like women no two men are exactly alike in need and preferences in touch.<br /><br />This book delves into the act of going down along with the gender on the receiving end of this erotic practice but the book is also littered with other practices and erotic short stories by Alison Tyler.  Of course the focus is in fellatio and the art of being able to give delightfully. My favorite chapter was on the technique of deep throating. Personally, I thought deep throating was a myth limited to exploitation on porn flicks but after reading the technique I'm sure to experiment with the technique. Every aspect of going down is covered between the pages of this book. If you ever had a question about going down this book answers it whether it concerns ejaculate, techniques, visual stimulation, toys, and even practicing.<br /><br />The book is a little dry for my taste but packed full of information that is useful and thought provoking if you genuinely want to please and enjoy giving by practicing fellatio I highly recommend you read this book.<br /><br />girldiver:)	2004-07-29

That said this pamphlet did a good job of explaining the G-Spot.<br />Although, the pamphlet explained all the pertinent information on the sexual correlation between the G-spot, the pudenda nerve, and pelvic nerve it didn't actually give me what I was looking for. With all the WHAT, WHERE, and WHEN questions answered for the G-Spot in this publication it was the HOW TO I was looking for and quite frankly this publication never actually gives you a 123 this is how you do it. Of course, I found this publication drowning in clinical studies that pretty much said we (women) all have a G-Spot but every woman's unique and distinct results to G-Spot stimulation are different and individual. So if you're interested in knowing more about the G-Spot this is a good place to start but I will be getting another book on the subject that is more specific in the HOW TO'S.<br />Also, I really like quotes and personal insights from individuals in books of this nature but I did not enjoy it in this book. It seemed to me the authors of this book included so much personal quotation and individual insight that not only did it seem 35% of the book was filled with it but also lead to contradiction.<br />This publication did address vaginal erogenous zones beyond the clitoris and G-Spot that I found most interesting and am compelled to study more in the future.<br />girldiver:)	2004-06-01

Written in a humorous and lighthearted manner this book is both entertaining and to the point. Addressing the many difficult uh oh's that exist but know one shared solutions with you until now and all conveniently located at your finger tips in 174 pages.<br />The intimate nature of sex makes it difficult for people to discuss both the pitfalls and joys of erotic behavior. SEX DISASTERS helps with the mishaps you might encounter and help you avoid situations before they happen. Just knowing some generalities that you didn't get in your high school sex education class or even in your current sexual experience might help you now and in the future.<br />Sex is enjoyable, funny at times, and dangerous. SEX DISASTERS helps you with the general what ifs, oh no, and the really big OMG problems that happen under the sheets, on top of the sheets, and all tied up in the sheets. This book is for all persons; the beginners and the experienced and if your not participating in sex than this book is for you for no other reason than to get a good laugh from the titles and illustrations.<br /> Covering topics from a variety of issues my favorite sections always started with \\"Extremely Complicated Instructions for Simple Stuff\\". Topics covered under \\"Extremely Complicated Instructions for Simple Stuff: were usually general guides for menstruation, how to put on a condom, knowing your way around women's underwear, and a woman's guide to male sexual response to name a few. Also, the simplest to the most complicated subjects are covered and discussed; from how to get certain stains out to legal and safety aspects. Both Ms. Hardy and Dr. Moser carefully address each topic with a variety of other professionals in specific fields of law, psychology, and yes even a veterinarian. Now I ask you, where was this book when I was eighteen? I really could have used the section, `every woman's guide to male sexual response' or even passed this book to my younger siblings every time they asked me a question.<br />I found this book witty, more helpful than any parental talk I ever got, and informative on a level easy to comprehend.

I was surprised to find out all sorts of other great stuff in this book.<br />Now that I have read this book, I think that in a life or death situation I certainly could perform this erotic practice but I don't think there are any life or death situations involved unless we are talking `the little death' of orgasm. As a woman, I did have a good idea involved in the `how to' but now I have a knowledgeable book sense of what men and lesbians are experiencing.<br />The book is well written and to the point, full of the usual female physiology, anatomy, and safe sex but I must say done very well. I didn't care for the chapter titles, not titillating enough for my taste with the exception of chapter five titled `taste and textures'. I did learn some great facts for example the ph of the vagina and the ph of seaman. Oh yeah there is a whole chapter on tongue techniques and positions. Oh and we do touch on some other practices in the sex arena but this book is focused on the giving and receiving of cunnilingus.<br />This book was spiced up quite nicely with the great short erotic stories at the end of each chapter written by Alison Tyler and sprinkled through out are some real people insights about going down. Also, included are some really wonderful illustrations.<br />Over all a good instruction book on this oral erotic practice enjoyed by so many.<br />girldiver:)	2004-03-29

Do it and feel better.	Ann Louise Gittleman a nutritionist and weight loss expert has put together a fantastic comprehensive guide that is educational and eye opening. This book is full of common sense health and nutrition advice every woman should know.<br />The book begins by categorizing general eating habits based on the current nutritional trends of the last 45-50 years and then details to our horror, how insufficient those eating habits are in maintaining a healthy weight let alone a healthy body. Whether low fat, low carb, high carb, or chronic dieting the book demonstrates the damage women inflict on their health by indulging in diets that are trendy and harmful. The book promotes balance and natural foods for both weight loss and overall health while detailing the importance of quality choices in our food consumption.<br />For me the most interesting and educational are the chapters that deal with fats and sugars in our diets. Gittleman's theorem is that the right kind of fats can be and are beneficial to women. For example, omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids are essential to proper bodily function and assist in the distribution of other vitamins and minerals throughout the body.<br />I also found the book informative in regards to the hormonal and reproductive health of women and the correlation to proper and balanced nutrition. She not only explains why but how to get all that you need by making wise choices in available foods and how they effect menstrual cycles, menopause, and P.M.S..<br />I will admit at times the book will detail scientific studies by different doctors and universities that reaffirm Gittleman's nutritional stance that although necessary I thought a bit dry. Overall this book is full of information about what women should be eating, should be avoiding, and how to go about it. On top of all the education the book has recipes, suggested menus, and a shopping list to help you on your way to a more balanced healthy lifestyle. I thought the book exceptional.<br />girldiver:)rldiver:)	2004-03-04

In 144 pages Ms. Taormino covers this subject completely in a very matter of fact and enthusiastic point of view. If you have never tried this kind of eroticism this is a great book to get. One of the reasons I liked this book was it was written by an enthusiast of anal eroticism and everything in the book she has a behind the scenes perspective that is very refreshing. Also, Ms. Taomino writes so casually, like a girlfriend giving you inside need to know information.<br />The book is organized and concise from the Introduction to the Resource Guide in the back. No matter what your experience is with anal eroticism you can learn from this book. Each chapter gives you more insight and understanding on this taboo experience. I enjoyed the whole book.<br />The Author does a great job dispelling the myths associated with this practice and delivering important information for making this experience pleasurable for the novice and experienced. There are 12 chapters excluding the introduction and the resource guide the book covers myths, anatomy, emotional and psychological aspects, tools of the trade, hygiene, heath aspects to the practice, and some of the funniest illustrations I've ever seen in a sex book.<br />If you want to learn more about this practice this is a great book to get, it delivers the information in a relaxed, humorous, and matter a fact way. The book is a great guide for women and men wanting to expand their repertoire in the bedroom.<br />girldiver:)	2004-02-22

It reads like a journal of a Lovers entanglement both rewarding and regretful.<br />You will take a journey of pain, hope, disenchantment, and even love. Our narrator is no fresh flower stumbling around marriage but knows very well the waters they find themselves in, rough and inviting.<br />I enjoyed this book because of the language and imagery used: beautiful, haunting, revealing, and truthful. Some wonderful examples are the following:<br />\\"What other places are there in the world than those discovered on a lovers body?\\"<br />\\"What then kills love? Only this: NEGLECT.\\"<br />The first sentence in the book is, \\"Why is the measure of love loss?\\" and that tells you pretty much what you need to know.<br />girldiver:)	2004-02-07

They are taken across the sea to a Sultan of great power and his palace of numerous slaves.<br />I found this final book to be rather tame but then again perhaps I was sufficiently shocked in the two previous books that all the sexual escapades seemed boring.<br />I am glad I read this series, it definitely opens your mind to a different mind set of acceptance and desire. Through out the book its characters decide what is their desire to be a slave and submit or to rise above submission as a dominator.<br />The bottom line is to be a true dominant you have to have submitted to everything to understand the dynamics of Submission.<br />I enjoyed the conclusion to Beauty's Journey of Submission but I do think it could have been better.

I've had this book since it was released in 1991. I actually met Rod Farb at a NC Diving Event. I live in NC and do a fair amount of diving off the coast and always, always, always take this book with me.<br />Rod's knowledge and experience is evident in every page. The author gives a brief history of each wreck, exact coordinates to locate the wreck, how the wreck rests at the bottom, and unique facts about the resting site. The book also include dive charters all over the Carolina's and a great resource guide.<br />When I say brief history, I mean to the point and concise but the author tells you interesting facts, such as, what company built the ship, other names the ship had, how it came to rest in the graveyard of the Atlantic. In some of the shipwrecks he retells accounts of the crew and their rescue or demise.<br />Each wreck listed has everything you need to know to plan your day of diving and develope a safe fun dive plan. From depth of the water the wreck is resting in, to the artifacts you can discover in the sand, and if you can retrieve anything from the wreck. He even shows diagrams and pictures of the layout of the wreck on the bottom of the ocean.<br />This is a facinating book if your interested in shipwrecks of all kinds and a must have if you are an avid scuba diver off the coast of NC. All sorts of wrecks are contained in the pages of this book from the purposely sunk for artifical reefs, to the casualties of storms, and the fatalities of War.<br />See you on the bottom!<br />girldiver:)	2004-01-22

I was compelled to read this sequel to `The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty'; I had already bought all the books.  Although the first one was disappointing from a character stand point I was not disappointed in the topic matter only the delivery.  This second book is much more deliberate in its telling of Beauty and Tristian, a fellow slave.<br />This book seems to concentrate on the trial and tribulations of Tristian rather than our Beauty.  Both Beauty and Tristian are disobedient slaves exiled to a near village for an extended punishment at the hands of everyday villagers skilled in the art of domination and submission.<br />The journey both Beauty and Tristian take is more than the physical and sexual nature but of a psychological tale of submission, understanding, and acceptance of the situation with in them and around them.<br />This second book was filled with acts of cruelty, desire, and satisfaction, but can be best described as Fantasy Erotica at its purist.<br />girldiver.	2003-12-30

Unlike alot of How to's for the bedroom this book reads like a conversation over coffee and a donut.  To say the least, Tristan Taormino writes about what she knows, SEX.<br /><br />She began her career in sex education at a sex-toy shop in NYC. She honestly tells you all the sexual anthropology she witnessed and then some.<br /><br />I did find the book refreshing in style and candor. It doesn't read like an ABC123 this is how you do it book, but somewhat like a personal experience from Ms. Taorminos' mouth to your ear. And let me just warn you now, if you dislike harsh slang maybe you should try a more clinical book.<br /><br />This book covers all the basics any other sex book would but then she covers it with a little kink.<br /><br />For the most part, this book did a great job with sex tools and toys.  Everything you ever wanted to know but couldn't drag yourself into one of those stores to find out is covered. Once you've read the Sex tools and toys chapter of her book you most decidedly want to check out the goods in person just to see if they really exist.<br /><br />This book also does a great job of demystifing the female G-Spot, female ejaculation, and anal sex.  In very plan language with seemingly life experienced knowlege Ms. Taormino tells you like it is.<br /><br />I did enjoy many sections of this book but it did just skim some topics. I also felt this was a book for boys who like girls and girls who like girls but fell short of addressing girls who like boys.<br /><br />Over all the book had some great places in it and great ideas but was decidely toned down from Ms. Taormino's usual Village Voice column and therefore could have been much better.<br /><br />Worth buying if your interested in tools, toys, and the awsome resource guide.	2003-12-04

Arthur Rimbaud's Poems and Prose speak a dark truth of life.<br />Rimbaud does not shield you from the realities of his time or his life. He writes of all the things he encountered as a child, soldier, poet, lover, and vagabond.<br />His poems are of his youth and his prose are of his life. The poems do not depict a romantic childhood but of one with struggle and cynism that he carried all his life. To read his poems is to experience his youthful assurance that the world was flawed.  You will be affected by his dark perception of the world and awed by his realistic and symbolic style.<br />As for his prose, he writes of a tortured existence and bohemian lifestyle steeped in a wild reality that was his life.<br />My favorit passages from this book of poems and prose:<br />&quot;One evening, I sat Beauty in my lap. - And I found her bitter. - And I cursed her.&quot; from A Season in Hell<br />&quot;It is found again. What? Eternity.

She is not his fairy tale love but simply a slave to his sexual perversion and the perversion his kingdom celebrates and exploits.<br />This book showcases BDSM in its purist form and this tale is not for everyone, not even an avid consumer of erotica.  Anne Rice unveils her very sexually dark imagination and sets the stage for a tale that will arouse, shock, question, and make you draw lines with in your nature you choose not to cross.<br />As for the writing, I can not begin to tell you my disappointment.  I expected her usually beautiful descriptives and more depth in her characters all of which this book lacked.  There is no indepth knowledge of the characters, no beautiful prosaic, and no plot.  I found this book simply written to describe horrendous acts of debauchery and depravity in a world where the word consent does not exist.<br />If you enjoy fantasy BDSM you might enjoy this but if your sensibilities are more reality based this might not be for you.  In so many ways I found this book to be pornographic and shocking.<br />I could not give this book higher than two stars due to my great disappointment in the writing style and lack of depth in the characters.

The Big O. is a concise easy to read overview of human sexual response and how to get to the finish line. Lou Paget does an excellent job organizing and giving you all the information out in the world today about sexual release for men and women. This is her third book and written to both genders unlike her previous books which were written for gender specific.<br />In 260 pages Ms. Paget manages to give you 'The Big O' from conception to completion with some fun stuff in between.  'The Big O' will definitely bring you up to date on the physiological aspects of your important parts to achieve orgasm.  Ms. Paget manages to do this with in the realm of education and not being crude.<br />She also touches on the very important aspect that [love making] begins in the head and the brain is the larges sex organ. She touches on the mental aspects of  boredom, anxiety, and arousal.<br />There are chapters dedicated to both men and women were she describes the different and numerous kinds of orgasms available to both men and women.  Both these chapters give you some very specific how to's on achieving orgasm.  By far I would say those two chapters will hold your interest and you will want to experiment using some of her ideas unless you knew them already.<br />Of course no book written on the subject of sexuality is complete today with out a chapter on the medical concerns of [intercourse] today.  Ms. Paget has two chapters one dedicated to discussing fitness, depression, desire, and menopause along with diseases that effect sexual response and outcome. She also has a chapter dedicated to sexually transmitted diseases.<br />Included in her book are chapters on Fun Stuff to try: aphrodisiacs, massage, aromatherapy, exercises, and other toys.<br />The book does an excellent job on describing mental and physical aspects of orgasm for men and women and touches on lots of other exciting ideas you might want to explore and expand future education. I enjoyed this book and learned a lot about the bodies of men and women and took some mental notes on the techniques offered in the book.  Over all I would say this is a great book for your library.<br />One of the fun things in the book are the snippets of information through out the book titled Historical and hysterical facts and Secrets from Lou?s Archives.

I have read all the Bad Boy Anthologies and this one towes the line pretty good.  So far I would say there is more humor in this book than the others. Quite refreshing.<br />Bringing Up Baby by Lori Foster - like lots of Ms. Fosters' stories  this is a continuation of the Watson Family, a short story on Gil Watson. You can read his brother,Sam Watson's, romantic story in one of the other Bad Boy books.  Gil is a professional man, business owner, professed work-aholic and has just found out he's a father.  Anabel an acquaintance has just showed up with the baby girl he knew nothing about and things are getting complicated fast. The mother of his baby has passed away and Anabel wants to keep the baby.

Also, I thought this book was funnier that the others, more romantic comedy than boy wants girl and etc.  So if you like the bad boy series you'll like this book.  It will make you laugh and it still sizzles.So if you like the bad boy series you'll like this book.  It will make you laugh and it still sizzles.	2003-10-27

Carl Streator is a journalist working on a story about SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). He is going on emergency calls to the homes of parents who have just lost their children and researching past SIDS cases looking for clues and a story.  He arranges to meet Helen Boyle, premier realtor for distressed haunted houses, a parent who lost a child to SIDS almost 20 years ago.<br />Carl Streators' journey is a twisted maze of supernatural, paranormal, pagan ritual, truth, discovery, and even love.<br />Chuck Palahnuik begins your journey into 'Lullaby' in a chilling account of paranormal haunting and when your good and scared he taps into your maternal/paternal needs of protecting children by detailing the deaths of infants.  I found the prologue and first couple of chapters difficult to read due to the images he evokes.<br />If your looking for eloquent prose of beauty and light you need to get a different book. 'Lullaby' is full of gritty descriptions, unusual characters, and a very dry dark sense of humor.  You will laugh in this book but in the oddest places.<br />I did enjoy this book but my biggest criticism is he had great insights about the media that was lost in the side plots and characters in this book. The book asks the questions what if you had the power to kill? What if the media told you how to feel, can you control yourself? Does the end justify the means?  Does power corrupt?<br />You will be surprised by the outragous and unusual events that only Chuck Palahnuik could dream up for us.  This is a departure from books like 'Choke' and 'Survivor' that were self discoveries and a step toward the genre of Horror.  If you like gritty tell it like it is style you'll like this book.<br />I liked it and would recommend it.	2003-10-24

She had a goal to get through college her way and the tenacity to do it. As amusing and even shocking as this memoir was at times you always new this was a means to an end, paying for college.<br />She really just stumbled on to being a dominatrix and just happend to be good at it. Shawna takes you from her childhood poverty and mindset to an adventure on her own and the discovery of her true womanly power, self respect and fearless confidence.<br />She writes this memoir in a very relaxed personal way.

She just tells it like it was the good, bad, ugly, and gross.<br />She talks about her clients, acts of her job, the scene of professional dominatrix, and the learning lessons she acquired.  The book really is a self-discovery and has some real moments of poignancy were she discovers the emotional consequences of her college job. Albeit an unusall memoir it was definitly filled with funny stories and insight. Definitly worth the read.	2003-10-19

It read like an interview of two fourteen year olds who decide to runaway from home.  Tar (David) runs away from alcoholic parents and an abusive home.  He just knows things will be better away from home just anywhere. Gemma runsaway to be with Tar and find freedom from overbearing parents.  Gemma's home isn't so bad but she is compelled to follow Tar out of a sense of duty.<br />Tar falls into a life squatting with older persons and enjoys his new found tranquility. Then Gemma joins him but do to some personality conflicts with other squatters she is forced to find other living arrangements and moves in with other squatters. Lily and Rob.  One problem Lily and Rob are heroin junkies.<br />One thing leads to others and soon their living the life of Junkies of smack(heroine).<br />As I said before the book reads as an interview of Tar and Gemmas  four year journey into streetlife,addiction, and many revelations of life. Each chapter is an interview with Tar, Gemma, or another one of the many people they come in contact with. Each person tells their tale of streetlife, squatting, drugs, sex, fear, sadness, and addiction.  It's a slow deliberate journey into depravity.  It's true this book does not preach drugs are bad but if you read it you can't help but know what these children do and go through no one should.<br />I can also say that these fourteen year olds seemed older to me but in the end the point is the same. Read the book it surely will leave you thinking.	2003-10-06

Elaine went to sleep in the 20th century in Chicago and woke up the next morning in another womans body in the 1880's English country side.<br />She discovers very quickly that the womans body she occupies has a crazy scottish nurse giving her orders, an unbearably rude man as her husband, and a crippled but functional leg.<br />The Plot wasn't perfect but worked. I had to remind myself this was her first book.  You actually end up concentrating on the unusual relationship of Morrigan( the womans body elaine occupies ) and her husband Charles, Lord Alcotte. You find out that they have been married one year or so and have never consumated the marriage. So the book concentrates on Charles plan to seduce his wife Morrigan(Elaine) and Elaines(Morrigan) struggle to stay faithful to her 20th century husband. She fails by the way, no big secret this is an erotic novel.<br />There is a mystery of how Elaine(Morrigan) came to 1880's England how to get back and where is Morrigan.Of course, like all of Robins books the real action and unraveling is in the last 4 to 5 chapters.<br />This is a love story between Elain(Morrigan) and Charles and full of erotic sex as you should expect. I was disappointed because there are several things you never find out in the ending. Lots of loose ends. But if you are a devout follower of Robin Schone read this. I did enjoy it if I hadn't I would not of finnished it.	2003-10-02

She has settled into a routine of children and saturday sex. When her children go off to summer camp she begins to wonder why her life is not fullfilled emotionally and sexually.<br />I was drawn into the book by the very first chapter when a motorcycle man drives up early in the morning and pleases himself on Sandy's lawn while she idly watches him from her bedroom window. Sandy begins to wonder what she is doing with her husband Norman and begins fantasizing about her old boyfriend Shep. The entire summer showcases Sandy's sexual awakening and extra marital affairs.  But like all things there are emotional and physical consequences.<br />This book was very Jong-like (Erica Jong author of fear of flying) full of emotion and personal exploration as another reviewer also mentioned. This book was well written by a talented woman, Judy Blume.  I never had the privledge to read her childrens books but I imagine they were good.<br />I too was disappointed in the ending but the book definetly demontrated the importance of communication and tenderness in marriage.  All in all I read the book from cover to cover and enjoyed Sandy's journey.	2003-09-29

I'm not sure whatelse to say except WOW. This book was hot. I had a few moments in the book when I thought this is not BDSM but real abuse but it all ties together at the end of the book. Since the book is a first person tale from Kristin's point of view you don't get a chance to find out what's going through Frank's head.<br />You don't actually get to know any history on the characters until you are way into the book but from the get go you can feel apart of them from their actions and conversation or lack of.  I did enjoy this book much better than the last Kim Corum book I read. This story flowed much better.<br />Even though this is a BDSM story it really is just a LOVE STORY.<br />If you like lite BDSM and unusual love stories with lots of great sex you'll like this book.

It was pure scary.<br />It really brought home to me how much power our government has and how we the people have lost control of the goverment.<br />The book was filled with stories of hide out drop outs and stupid things criminals do.

Quite a feat for me, if it wasn't good I would have lost interest at 225 and put it down, but it was was an exciting, erotic read full of debauchery, death, and hope.<br />The book opens to a prologue introducing Bernedette Kane and her friend Eric Killen who are protecting her sister Peggy's honor in school.  Years latter Peggy committs suicide over an extra marital affair but something doesn't feel right for Bernedette.  Bernedette decides to find out if her sister was murdered or psychologically wounded to the point of suicide. Whatever it was she is on mission to find out.  She goes on the only clue she has , her sister told her is first name and said he had a corporate jet.<br />She gets Eric to track down the plane and the name an comes up with a CEO of Oar Research named Wesley Edwards. Upon talking her way into a job at Oar she discovers Wesley doesn't seem to be what she originally thought but is still determined to find the truth but discovers something all together different.........<br />The book has several characters that are very interesting.  Diana and Damien are the source of all the sexual debauchery and depravity.  Their antics were cruel, dangerous, and involved many innocent people.  They also were extremely exciting to read. Their anitcs also gave a look at S&M gone completely off kilter. They cared only for their own sexual release.<br />Over all the book demonstrates through many twists and turns that all relationships need some degree of love and hope to sustain and last.  And I certainly felt an underlining tone of faith.<br />This is a fast paced book with lots of action, sex, death, and hope.  You will be guessing all the way through it. I did.	2003-09-20

IMPETUOUS- Lori Foster<br />I realize this is a re-release but I still found it entertaining.  Lori Foster wrote this book in 1996 and I can see she hadn't quite developed her now signature Lori Foster Alpha-Male character. This book seemed a little more balance to me, not so much male brevado as she is writting now.<br />Carlie is a shy woman hurt by the men in her past and isn't looking for a man. She lets her best friend talk her into wearing a very revealing costume to a party and attracts the #1 male batchelor in town, Tyler. Tyler is intrigued by carli from a distance, unlike the rest of the female population this disguised woman isn't throwing herself at him she's running from him.<br />Well Tyler follows and one thing lead to a one nite stand with a woman he doesn't even know and he can't get his sister-in-law to tell him who she was. So he moves on but doesn't quite forget the woman and the instant chemistery they shared.<br />Enters fate, Tyler ends up helping shy Carli with a charity project and becomes intrigued with her too.  She isn't throwing herself at him.  The premise is good and enjoyable.  Read the book to find out did Tyler find out who his mystery woman was or does his memory of the mystery woman disrupt a great friendship and budding romance with Carli.<br />ONE WICKED WEEKEND- Julie Elizabeth Leto<br />Lauren returns to New Orleans to write an article for her magazine and decides to also punnish her former lover, Luc, for dumping her painfully eight years ago.

Anne Rice wrote Jeremy as an unassuming person from a distance but completely complicated and simple at the same time.<br />This story is about a 40sh child book author who against his better judgment is deeply attracted to Belinda a sixteen year old child by law but woman at heart.  He knows nothing of who Belinda is but is consumed by her and a need to know who she really is.  This book cleverly unravels secrets old and new while painting you a picture of a life few people can imagine.<br />The book slowly reveals Jeremy's and Belindas secrets while taking you on a journey through this taboo subject of love, passion, and obsession with a minor.<br />This book was advertised as erotic but it certainly was not graphic sexually.  I suppose the erotic was directed to the taboo subject of sex between a minor and legal adult.  I was a little leary of the idea but as you read you question who is the adult in the relationship Jeremy or Belinda. Belinda clearly matured quickly and Jeremy is still struggling with his childhood memories and fears. Also, the subject of pornography versus art is an interesting subject considering most of the paintings Jeremy painted were of Belinda nude.<br />Whether Anne Rice intended it to be a topic in her book or not I read Belinda and wondered/questioned if the legal age in the USA should be 18. Lots of countries recognize younger people to be adults. Maturity is indivual and varies amoung all ages.<br />As I said before the sex was not written graphically but the entire romance was written so sensually you didn't need it to be graphic. Anne Rice certainly is a great example of wonderfull writing. You can feel the passion as you read.<br />I fell in love with Jeremy and Belinda and the entire book.	2003-09-15

I have read several other books and short stories by Ms. Schone and I beleive this is the best so far well atleast my favorite.<br />A wonderful story of a woman needing love and wanting to give love. Elizabeth believes her husband has taken a mistress so she sets out to win him back by taking lessons in love from a notorious disreputable man (Rameil-the bastard sheik) with a reputation for sexual excess.<br />These are not physical lessons but turorial book work from the famed 'The perfumed Garden'. She wants her husband back not a lover but as the sexual tension builds and Elisabeth tries to seduce her husband with her new skills and courage her world begins to unravel.<br />This book has many secrets and at times you can almost guess the secrets but it is the careful weaving of the plot that keeps you reading on.  Like lots of Schones books each page reveals more and more, you become hypnotized by the rythme of the conversation and plot, almost riveted.  I like Ms Schones books greatly. I am not sure its literature or not I just enjoyed the read. It dawned on me that it remined be of DH Lawrences' LADY CHATTERLY'S LOVER of course no comparison in style or literary greatness just simple similarities in the characters. Lady Chatterly was a very lonely woman looking for love and so is Elisabeth Petre.<br />Of course a warning for those readers who are offended by sex situations, sex talk, and alternitive life styles: this book is full of erotic situations and should not be read by the easily offended reader.	2003-09-04

Isadora will discover friendship, betrayal, love, loss, and most of all courage.<br />I love Erica Jongs writing style. She is a realist but at times I often wonder how much of her books are fiction or autobiographical. I enjoyed her sequal to FEAR OF FLYING and do recommend it.	2003-09-03

I love poetry but had not read many if any of emily dickinson so I picked this up to read in my spare time.  At first glance the book and poems seemed so simple and easy to read.  I thought it would be a small little delight to read her short poems while waiting in the car, or at the bank, in line at the grocier, but as I embarked on a stolen moment with the poems of emily dickinson you discover her poems are hardly simple.<br />Every poem seems has more than one meaning. You can truely see how complicated this simple woman must have been even in her observations.<br />I have been delighted by her insight and each poem makes me wonder of the woman who wrote them. A lovely read.	2003-09-02

This is an easy to read book on how to fast for your health: mind, body, and spirit.  The author does not try to convience you that this is the ultimate in health but educates you on the benefits of fasting, why it should be practiced, and how to go about it.<br />The book touches on the different types of fasting, the duration of fasting, how to start, and importantly how to come off of a fast.<br />There are several different kinds of fasting but what suprised me was the benefits of fasting during short periods of time: 24 to 36 hours.  I had several misconceptions of fasting: that it was a long period of complete deprevation, I was wrong.  The book outlines the benefits of short term and long term fasting and the effects of detoxifying the body with fasting.<br />Other topics discussed is fasting for weightloss and the nutritional balance of certain juices during fasting.<br />If you are new to the fasting concept and practice this is a great book to start.	2003-08-29

At the near mention of this book to a mass of people brings forth sexual notions of what people associate this work of literature and most are wrong.  I found this book to be filled with intense emotional loneliness and sadness not the sexual adventure most associat with this final work of DH Lawrence.<br />A story of a woman(Lady Chatterly, Connie) who is married to very self involved man that is made more self involved upon his war injuries and her needs for emotional and physical intimacy.  With her deep loneliness Connie begins an affair with Mellors the GameKeeper on her husbands estate and struggles with the internal morality of loving someone who is of a lesser class and her real love of him.  With Mellors she adores him and needs him away from him she questions herself and feels the shame of her actions.<br />One of the themes I loved about the book was choice.  The ability to make ones own choice and live with the consequences.  Through out the book Connie makes choices she is willing to live with and Mellor never forces his will on her.  She is the Mistress of her Choices and no one else.  I thought it interesting that Lawrence would make her so strong willed on one hand and pschologically lonely on the other.<br />This book is a psychological journey of one woman and the man she loves more than it is a sexual escapade.  I can see how this book was shocking in the late twenties but seems very tame today.<br />I found this book very sad and wouldn't recommend it to someone on prozac or other anti depressant drugs. I also found the writing very eloquent and filled with lots of quiet observations of relationships between men and women that are true today and in the future.  DH Lawrence you could say was ahead of his time or you could say came at just the right time either way you should read his work.<br />This particular book had a introduction and forward written by others that was very insightful.  Also, an afterword written by DH Lawrence himself that again extremely insightful.  It is hard to beleive he was sick through out the writing and publication of this book that is wonderfully written.  Perhaps that is why it is so sad. He kind of says live your life to the fullest in love and sex for life is too short.in extremely insightful.

Gabriel is a former male prostitute who has become successful in the seedy world of prostitution but is haunted by is childhood poverty, his whoring, and being raped.<br />He is caught up in the search for the man who raped him and the mystery of the woman (Victoria) who sold her virginity to him.  Victoria is a woman of former position and education who has through poor circumstances ended up on the streets with only her virginity as her sole most valuble possession and sells it to Gabriel so she may survive.<br />This story is intertwind with several other plots that I could write for days so you should read the book and experience them for yourself. You won't get bored I didn't. I read this book in two days and hated for it to end.<br />You journey with Gabriel and Victoria as the mystery of both Gabriel and Victoria unviels it's self.<br />this is a wonderful intimate book full of sensual and erotic pleasure but like Robin Schones writing style extremely personal and intimate.  It's like being in the room with the characters.....A fly on the wall.

So I eagerly wanted to read this book.  Although, I was fascinated by the characters by day persona and intrigued by her sexual exploits by night I found this book not as engaging as \\"Raw Silk\\" but still very good and worth the read.<br />This book has two different plot lines running through it; the Main character Miranda our doctorate student by day researching victorian erotica for her thesis and the secret life of Beatrice a woman from the victorian age who Miranda stumbles on looking for evidence of erotic truth of the victorian time via an old journal of Beatrices thoughts and erotic sexual exploits.<br />I found the two plot lines weaved together rather well and I was equally interested in both women.<br />Miranda takes a risky and dangerous journey of erotic pleasure indulging in anonymous consensual sex and discovers her own sexual power and weakness but I felt like I would rather learn more about Mark her sexual partner.  Maybe Ms. Sarai will write a book for him or someone similar. If you enjoyed \\"Raw Silk and Ruby's Rules\\" you will enjoy this book also.<br />I enjoy Ms. Sarais writing style and look forward to more books by her.	2003-08-11

I was not a reader of Nicholas Sparks but I picked up this book for a quick read at the beach....<br />Once I started the first chapter the pressure started building behind or on top of my chest and the tears welled in my eyes until I read and cried for two full hours.  I couldn't put this book down it was so good. Sometimes a girl just needs a good cry and this is the book to give it to you.  I cried for Noah's happiness, his loss, his pain, his regret, his kindness, and most of all for his simple love of one woman.<br />This is a story of love lost and found.  You absolutely can't help but fall in love with Noah and Allie.  A wonderful book.

I saw the book in one of those big franchise book stores and the cover caught my eye, white with a zipper half unzipped revealing red underneath. Now that I have read \\"Fear of Flying\\" the cover seems very symbolic and provacative just like the book.<br />From the dedication to the afterword I was captivated by this book, a true literary work about a woman seeking self.  It is not a chick lit book but true literature.  I couldn't beleive I missed this book all my life, I am in my early thirties and had never heard about it but wish I had it starting in my teens.<br />Every woman, every man should read this book it gives great insight on the insecurities of women.  From sentence one I felt like Isadora Zelda White Wing spoke to me of my own doubts and emotional struggles.  All of a sudden I was not alone...I was not lost, her journey was mine and mine hers.<br />This book was about getting your passion back along with your identity, not sex or fantasies as so many want to dwell on.  Although she is very candid about her sexual exploits(Isadora's) and the language is very forward but its relevent to the story.<br />As a woman,  I can say that the idea of the zipless f...k has had an appeal but after reading her encounters with Dr. Goodlove you have to re-address your impulses and figure out what you really are looking for.  I think that was the true teaching of this book........find out who you really are not what or who defines you.	2003-08-04

This book was so outrageous I couldn't keep the laughter to myself.  I absolutely laughed out loud and those are the best kinds of funny.  I can't quite tell you what was funnier: the vision of macho Tucker flying a pink plane, the talking fruit bat, Tuckers outrageous sexual antics, Kimi; the transexual filipino navigator, or the down to earth cannibal.<br />This book was great it had fun, adventure, suspense, a little heartache, sex, and a plot.

Ms. Sarai is a wonderful writer of erotica....I just loved Raw Silk and Incognito but Ruby's Rules falls short of expectation.<br />The story is centered on Ruby Chen a young sexually dominating CEO, her assistant Margaret, and corporate rival Rick Martell. We see the story unravel with all three characters points of view which was interesting except a little distracting.  Although the book is called Ruby's Rules I felt like she wasn't much in control and the rules changed as often as the wind blew.  Yet the book definetly explored BDSM and the roll of a novice dominatrix in Margaret, Rubies Assitant.<br />Although, there was lots or sex I felt the plot and characters unravel as we came to the end of the book.  I say the book could have been better considering the talents of Ms. Sarai.	2003-07-30

Nothing.<br />This book started slow- I think all of chucks stuff starts out slow and are a little confused until you get to the end and then you sigh and say oh yeah \\"I get it\\".<br />It's about Victor Mancini who chokes on purpose and is a sex addict. all the sex and sex addict stuff is laugh out loud funny. Who said sex was an awkard necessity that looks funny from the outside oh yeah I did and this book definetly shows you how funny sex can be seen as funny.<br />As for what it's about... you'll have to decide for yourself. I saw it as a self discovery, one persons journey in their head. I saw Victor as incredibly intelligent yet incredibly lost human being living his life through near necessity. I thought the book was very provacative and thouht provocking but Chucks style is sometimes harsh and hard to get into. He certainly isn't a fluid writer but who says he has to be it takes all kinds.<br />I like the book and I think about even now months later.	2003-07-29

Oh Yeah again, Robin Schones story made this book of anthologies for me.<br />Ecstacy by Beatrice Small-I read one chapter of her story and skipped it.  I don't know why just did.<br />Bound and Determined by Susan Johnson-This was a sad romance almost torture how she left him but a good story if you like bondage, voyuerism, kidnapping. A princess and an aritocratic libertine rake you can't go wrong except I felt so bad for him.<br />Dark Desires by Thea Devine-Romance with a twist and lots of frustating sex with definate SM undertones. Set in the South with Plantations and all.  Very steamy I like Dru and Courtland.<br />A Lady's Pleasure by Robin Schone- by far the most romantic story and not a hint of SM. A lonely Spinster on her last holiday and a Colonel in the Millitary on convalescence both looking to forget.  She wants to forget the future of having to marry for families reputation and he wants to forget his violent past in the millitary.  Together they discover new people within them selves with the help of each other.  And you won't believe what he does in the ending.  Very daring for that time period.

What courage it must of taken. You read the first half of the book and feel as if he is guiding you through your journey of self enlightenment by sharing his own story of sucess and failures. He doesn't even try to convert you but tries to give you a better understanding of the practice and people involved.  The second half of the book is basic instruction and supplies(bondage,flagellation, etc.) very informative and full of tips if you want to pursue this activity.<br /><br />Of course, if you have read other reviews you know he is a safety boy and I think that's good.  Girls like that. Also, his candor is so refreshing and very attractive.<br /><br />Since reading this I might explore some aspects to SM; most people already do in a very light way by making specific demands or complying to demands in the bedroom but I will be as Jay suggests putting safety first and taking things slow.<br /><br />I found this book very informative, in your face informative, and extremely forward in sex talk.  So if your curious buy this book it's very good.  You don't have to do anything you aren't ready for sometimes reading the ins and outs are fun and you can choose to indulge or just be well read in the subject.<br /><br />Also, there are quotes throughout the book that are extremely funny and eye opening.	2003-07-29

Four erotic sexy and thought provoking stories........Robin Schones story was the best and last......<br />Mastering Lady Lucinda by Beatrice Small-Of course it was full of hedonistic sex...but I was appalled by the theme. Kidnapping and coersion at the helpful hands of your family.  I was enraged at Lucinda's brother and thought he should have gotten severly punnished for putting his own sister in a such a situation.  Once I got past that the romance between Lucinda and the Master was extremely fitting.<br />Risking It All by Susan Johnson-I am a fan of Susan Johnson and loved this story of loving and winning in Monte Carlo.<br />The Pleasure Game by Thea Devine-The theme of asking to be someones mistress/whore and allowing someone to throw money at you sickened me.  The sex was great but I felt that the emotions written were not true to true degregation a woman would have felt.<br />A Man and A Woman by Robin Schone-The reason I bought this book and truly worth it....Who else can sexually excite you and provoke deep spiritual thought ubiquitously.  A fabulously woven story of need, acceptance, and love. Every Schone work I have read so far has a facinating and mysterious twist in the end.<br />Good book.	2003-07-23

To pay for college she answers an ad for &quot;COED$&quot; and begins her year as a call girl.<br />At the very beginning you realize that for all her likeable qualities she's jaded and emotionally vulnerable.  I liked the character but I pittied her more.  The journey she takes is told with alot of humor or I wouldn't have finished the book.  As it was I struggled in the last few chapters to the end.<br />Belle tells the story with lot of laugh out loud humor and skillfully writes about the goings on of Bennington Blooms exploits as student, call girl dejour, girlfriend, daughter, and vulnerable young woman.  The story doesn't really go anywhere or expand on supporting characters as much as it just follows Bennington for a year.<br />Although, the book was not what I expected I will read her next book High Maintenence.	2003-07-11

Her ability to create the erotic/romance and lace it with the dark reality of human frailty while weaving an underlying plot that will rock you in the last three or four chapters is amazing.<br />You read and experience the characters while always knowing there is something else going on.  You turn the page again and again just to get a glimse of the next.  I was enthralled and sucked in from the very beginning.<br />Both characters are hopelessly flawed. Micheal/Michel and Anne journey together on a road not of their making but of their need for companionship and solace in their choices.  I can't go into the plot too much because it will give away the surprise at the end. A warning: this is a highly erotic novel and quite graphic.<br />I enjoyed this book greatly and will read the sequel Gabriel's Woman and some of the other books by Robin Schone	2003-07-08

I highly recomend it.	2003-07-07
US	32551119	R3CS22WUDMC9EN	0758200846	855404492	Too Much Temptation	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Enthralling..........	How can you not love any of Lori Fosters books.  Again she churns out a hot little read.  I read in in one day.<br />I loved Noah Harper and Grace Jenkins and even the pesky Grandma Agatha.  Again did I mention it was a hot read.  Well let me say it again hot. hot. hot.<br />Of course if you are easily offended and rather prude don't read this book.  It was rather sensual in lots of places.<br />I wasn't going to buy this book at first but now that I have bought it and read it I will read the next book about Noah's brother Ben Baldwin.	2003-07-03
US	32551119	R1CQXBRV8ZB0XW	0515133086	310927993	Beyond Seduction	Books	3	5	5	N	N	sexy and frustrating....	I loved Beyond Innocence and loved the character of Merry Vance so I was glad for the sequel.<br />Merry is a very strong willed person with clear ideas of what she does not want, marriage, and discovers being unconventional is not accepted in her world. So she devises a plan to ruin herself by running away to a notorious painter, Nic Craven, that will paint her nude.<br />There are several twists and turns in this story that will suprise you and frustrate you.  I personally kept on reading and got exasperated with the two characters wanting them to work this out and get on with it but I must admit that was part of the fun in this book.<br />Also the sex is quite graphic and yet tender and loving.  I did like this book and would recommend it.  I would like to see another in this series perhaps a book about her brother Peter or her suitor Ernest.	2003-07-01
US	32551119	R2F3SXBGENK2LY	0373835280	178914740	Forever and Always	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Gab and Jordan....Amazing	Another great book from Lori Foster....<br />I was touched by the tenderness of Gab. After getting the impression that he is just a playboy Lori Foster delivers us a Gab with more depth and sensitivity than expected.  This was a tender and fun read.<br />As for Jordan, you realize he has more demons to snare than the other brothers so its only fitting he requires a more troubled love interest.  I found Jordan interesting and a bad boy with a big heart.<br />Of course, like of of Lori Fosters books emotionally stimulating and lots of hot physical sex.  If you liked Once and Again with Sawyer and Morgan you will enjoy Forever and Always with Gab and Jordan.	2003-06-30

I really enjoyed all the quick lines and great dialogue between all the characters.<br />Jo Miles the heroine of this book is trying to find out who she is after a divorce but I really felt like shaking Jo Miles at times and found myself mumbling to the book for her to do something anything other that what she did or didn't do.  Although, the book is a good read and I recommend it I felt as if Jo was a bit naive slow to wise up.<br />All in all a good book to take to the beach.	2003-06-25

Extremely erotic with several plot turns and situations that were unexpected. I couldn't put it down.  I had to know what they were going to do next.<br />Emma Holly captures the emotions complicated situations and gives a modern feel to a story from another century and a society that didn't value women much.  Yet her female characters were strong and sometimes flawed as were her male characters.<br />And lets not forget the erotic love scenes. Too Hot to mention on the net. You must read the book	2003-06-23
US	32551119	R3OX0DWGHJ9NEM	0373835272	36302254	Once And Again	Books	4	3	3	N	N	I love that family of boys.	This two part book about Sawyer and Morgan is great.<br />I was completely enthralled in the goings on of Sawyer and Honey.  The story was passionate, heartwarming, and kept me reading.<br />I love that the characters are always so emotionally flawed like everyone in this world.  You literally rally for them to get it together and get to the bed.<br />As for Morgan and Misty,  I found it very tender that Morgan could be so accepting.<br />Of course I am addicted to all of Lori Fosters works and read them like there going out of style.  But if you love romance and sex you'll love this book.	2003-06-23

I immediatly felt a kinship and empathy for Lisa Diodetto and fell in love with Eben Strauss and their struggle for companionship and acceptance.<br />I loved this book and it illustrated beautifully that the road to love is painful atimes and rewarding.<br />This is the first novel I have read by Rita Cerisi and was very impressed with the full characterization, original dialogue between characters, and the instant feeling of truth.  I will read more of her work and the follow up to Pink Slip.	2003-06-17

This book haunted my soul, stirred my dormant need to seek adventure, and put me in a pensive state of mind.<br />You don't just read her book you experience every thought, action, and the moments with her.  Her writing style is relaxed and thought provoking.  Gelman brings a compassion to the people she visits and takes a part of their worlds with her when she leaves.  I loved this book.	2003-06-06

It was easy to read and I laughed on every page.  A real look at women and a glimpse in to the soul of one woman trying to figure out what's wrong in her life and how to move forward.<br />Every situation is looked at through the eyes of a realist with just a little sarcasm, a little laughter, and hope.	2003-05-23
US	32551119	R2KJMK38S77NDR	0385498721	179075750	Survivor: A Novel	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Great Satire in a weird pensive way	I must admit my ignorance....I thought it was about a alternitive rock star at first that became a prepackaged lean cuisine for todays society.  I was wrong but right.  It was about a pre-packaged lean cusine for todays society but all wrapped up in evangelist jim and tammy PTL way.<br />I thought the first three chapters were a little sluggish but so far all I have read from Mr. Palahnuik has been.  I thought this was very thought provoking considering all the current american idol make over of everyday people, who can sing, to turn them into icons.<br />Okay, so this book was about a kid from a cult living in the big world but not living.  He was programmed to do all the things he does and hates it.  Then he meets Fertility the girl who would change his mind on several things and make him question the abuse he has been enduring.  Lots of self talk in this book and observations that will make you laugh and make you sad.<br />Over all I liked it in a kooky thoughtful real people way.	2003-05-20

But why is it the woman is the vampire it's kind of an allegory if your just a little jaded.<br />I liked all the witty conversation between the main characters and the funny off hand view of the world they live in.	2003-05-01

The O'Malley's is a great series of books and this one compliments the series very well.<br />I especially  enjoyed the personal interaction that Dee Henderson seems to be so good at.  I suppose I will never pass a fire station with out thinking about this book and that dreamy Jack.<br />This one had a great story line and lots of other stuff going on around the main story.<br />I liked it.	2003-05-01

It contained great underlying relationships that keep you reading and gets you involved. You will fall in love with Lisa O'Malley while she takes this journey full of twists and turns.  I thought this book was the best of the O'Malley series.	2003-04-22
