This is quaint and sweet and the drawings are very 1950's How-To. Being on a serious budget and hoping my teens might take a glance through the book, I found it a waste of money. Instead I highly suggest that you purchase \\"A Guide to Elegance : For Every Woman Who Wants to Be Well and Properly Dressed on All Occasions,\\" \\"Entre Nous : A Woman's Guide to Finding Her Inner French Girl,\\" and last but not least, \\"What Southern Women Know (That Every Woman Should) : Timeless Secrets to Get Everything you Want in Love, Life, and Work.\\" Of course anything by Judith Martin is right on track, as well!  <br /> <br />I collect old magazines and this fits in with what was being written in women's magazines in the '50's. My teens are more than likely to read this book and mock it rather than find it informative.  <br />	2005-08-10

Say for instance, if a patient wanted fast food in his or her own home but the hospital nurse said no, then he or she went without, never mind that the food brought colour to the patients' cheeks and got them to eat and push food out. That may have only been that place-- I don't know. It takes a lot for the family to stand up to medical care. When I bought this book because a friend was near death and I wanted to support her family and be able to offer advice from the sidelines, I found out that the funeral industry does not support the families but itself. People just get yanked in every direction for their wallets and long term payment plans and \\"buy now because the price will double in a week's time for this particular burial plot.\\" I laughed through this and I borrowed \\"Decca's\\" wit more than a few times in the aftermath of my friends' passing. Who can a grieved family complain to? Everyone thinks it is just them speaking through their anger. Jessica teaches us to be prepared and this is the best way to keep from getting jerked about!   <br /> <br /> <br />Everyone who will ever need to deal with death needs to read this book. I've rewritten my will to request that I get the cheapest, tackiest casket available (my husband doesn't believe in cremation or I'd prefer that) and that copies of this book be set out as \\"party favours\\" for my funeral. If I could have a cause, this would be it! <br /> <br /> <br />If my fellow readers are able to, I highly reccomend that they read anything they can get their hands on by the Mitford Girls. These ladies made headlines for themselves durring their time.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-01

I have a large family and my bathroom is off limits. I go in there to read. This is in there and I have enjoyed it! Obviously the author is in the upper crust of society where all of her friends have roots in the country and have a place to retreat to-- but I like reading about *that class*-- I would not read about moms with big families who suffer through difficult situations to have fun. This was a fun read. <br /> <br />I started finding my \\"inner Frenach girl\\" as soon as I started reading the book. It's easier to find your inner French girl than it is to emmulate Martha Stewart (I love Ms. Stweart-- she is just impossible to try to work in to my life.) I immediately slowed down my dinners because I liked how the French girl takes time to eat and doesn't eat it all at once. My son with special needs tends to gobble his food so I started serving the food course by course instead of all at once. It worked. He even likes me serving the cheese at the end of the meal and is trying hard to eat nicely.  <br /> <br />The French girl has limited space, the author says. I started thinking like I lived in Paris in a small apartment and actually got some rooms decluttered and clothes out of the house. Dressing nice is easy when you have five or six really nice things to change around your wardrobe. <br /> <br />My daughter was about to break up with her first boyfriend-- she read how *the French girl* views relationships and she handled it with class and finesse.   <br /> <br />What impressed me was how this was going to be a fun read but it would up being a catalyst for making some nice adjustments in my life! I reccomend it for being fun to read but also, if you want to add flare to areas where you'd felt dull, it is inspiring.	2005-04-21

My daughters are in their teens and their step mother is always getting on them about how rude they are and how they must have learned this offensiveness from their mother (me!) (Her issues with me have to do with interactions that shouldn't be discussed with the kids.) My daughters have laughed together over things they have read in this book that their step mom just ignores, but they are too polite to say anything to her. . . Step children do not have a monopoly on bad manners! <br /> <br />The games are great and I especially like the ones that deal with personal interactions. I have a large family and it is nice to have a book as an authority that the kids enjoy and will cite to each other.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-11

St. Ex was no doubt an interesting man. I adored his little rose and couldn't wait to read The Tale of the Rose. I just read it and I have deeper insight into this story that I'd have rather not seen. St. Ex was a philanderer. In the Little Prince, he refers to The Rose being sad because she is aware that he has been seeing other roses-- he did that throughout their marriage-- for almost the entire 13 years they were married. He was into conquoring The Rose as a Little Prince and basically forgetting about her except to get with her briefly-- less than 24 hours in some cases-- and then leave again. The Little Prince almost seems like a glaze-over and justification for St.Ex's ways. I gave it three stars because it's a sweet story. It's not somehow autobiographical as I had initially thought.	2005-03-02

I recieved my copy of this book and started to read it and I read it with one hand as I prepared dinner, cleaned up, got the kids off to bed, and decluttered the house. I made some tea and continued to read. At about midnight the phone rang-- my husband had to go in very late to help someone-- and I just about had a heart attact as I stammered into the phone, \\"Oh G--, who is this?\\"<br />The book is THAT rivetting and THAT real. <br />AS the other critiques indicate, this is about a women's arrest with trumped up charges that only got worse, and her survival in the gulags. I felt like I connected with her because she is a mother and a professor. She lost her profession and her children in the blinking of an eye. I couldn't read it without checking on my own children and thanking God that we live in a place that is not like what hers was. You realise that there was little way of surviving for someone who wanted to play sanely and defend herself in an insane system. When she was in isolation, I felt like I was there with her. She doesn't write in a frilly, dramatic manner; she writes with a simple, clear voice. She isn't asking the reader to feel sorry for her because she is only telling her story. <br />I think the most movingpoint of the book was when she was in a camp helping out in the kitchen and she found out that one of her early accusers was in the camp and dying. Another prisoner came in and asked for rations as he was sharing with this man and she was about to tell him to relay to the dying man that Eugenia Semyonovna sent them to him, but then she stopped herself, \\"How could I poison this man's last meal?\\"<br />You see how a person can get to the point of loosing thier sanity then save themselves from loosing it and how many lost it and never regained it.	2004-01-18

Southern women don't possess a monopoly on good manners. The book emphasises lots of truisms: be fair, don't insult a man who inappropriately makes moves on you but be firm, write thank you notes, watch what you divulge to people that you don't know because friendships (and sadly even marriages) aren't for forever all the time, you can get more bees with honey, think possitive thoughts when you are really, really mad so you don't act with a lack of class, etc. <br />This is the kind of a book that you need to read when you want to lash out inappropriately at someone. The author's real-life experiences make the advice practical and the biggest lesson that I learned from the book (and from life) is that people seldom regret keeping their mouths shut when they are mad. The advice isn't new, but the format is enchanting.	2004-01-17

I called myself a COW-tess after my ex, whom I was married to at the time, passed OCS and became an officer. I didn't take myself (or him) too seriously and had a blast being married to the military but wasn't enamoured of my husband (and that is another story for another time!) <br />This book was a life saver for me. I had learned proper etiquette in high school at my parent's private expense, then thought that I'd never need it again. I did. This book is wonderful for *you* as one who cares about the little things like how to write an invitation, how to correctly set a formal table, etc. needs to know them. I used it. I still have it and while I don't need it any more, it makes a great reference and when not in use, it's bulk doubles as a delightful flower press.<br />If you have an axe to grind or don't think that you will need this book, then for goodness sake, don't buy it! I liked going over to the other side. I liked being invited to parties where the wives who had once not had a reason to be interested in me were inviting me to lunches. I liked that I could entertain with flare. The problem with living on a base is that fraternisation causes gossip. You can't confide something personal lest it gets out, be it to a lower ranking person's spouse or a higher ranking person's spouse. (Call your mother and tell her!) Learn the rules and they will protect you-- it's a good lesson for any way of life.	2003-12-18

My daughters, ages 13 & 12, were not interested in their lessons in geography so I purchased this in hopes of helping them find an interest in pre-WWII Europe. They read through this overnight.<br />The book isn't just about two girls leaving their father and going to a concentration camp. We read and discussed how people of the main characters' own ethnic group (Jewish, in this case) could betray each other for a \\"scrap from the kitchen\\" and how others from a different group (Gentile) would risk their lives to help save them.  <br />The book portrayed two sisters surviving with help from their friends when they didn't know what was going to happen next and having the courage to continue in the face of extreme hatred, at the whims of prison guards and vile fellow inmates.	2002-10-14

No, I couldn't call up my girlfriends and gossip about  these things-- not many 25 year olds know a lot about Gloria Swanson or  have heard about the movers and shakers of two generations ago. It was  fascinating to read of someone's life while in the midst of the people who  were defining her era (including Fleur Cowles, herself.)

The ideals are polished and his personal faith explained-- Michael Harper has  definitely lived his life doing as God had bade him and given his heart to  Him.<br />But Orthodoxy is more than a set of ideals and philosophies based on  God's Word. It's a bunch of people. Once you get in or even part way in, it  is just like college when you started talking like a liberal, only with  Orthodoxy your language gets peppered with word phrases like, &quot;The One  True Way&quot;, &quot;The Truth&quot;, &quot;Obedience to Father&quot; (who  is an emmisary of God and well-- they are human, too)&quot;The One  Church&quot; &quot;The One True Church&quot;-- Orthodox Christian Churches  can get pretty exclusionary to visitors and don't tolerate struggling  parents with fussy babies or any potential struggles very well, and this is  the reason that I feel that it started to take off in the US and then  pettered out.

After reading Dancing Alone, I had to buy or borrow all of Mr Schaefer's books. The only reason that he doesn't get five stars is because my writing is just as volatile and raw with emotion as his is, and if I had to get  A-'s, I can't give him A+'s for the same style! (However, he does make $$  off his books so maybe I should reconsider. . .)<br />The advice of Calvin's  mother to pray for wet dreams so he'd not masterbate is similar to ideas  that were planted in the heads of the boys in my Christian school boys' sex  &quot;education&quot; classes. And the family secrets are the same.  However, since placing my heart in Orthodox Chistianity, I have found the  same nutty mentalities-- but they are pretty exclusive to the Communities.  (There is a reason the Living In Community Churches want to see how well  you conform before they let you in!)<br />If he comes out with a third story  of Calvin coming to terms with Orthodoxy, I hope that he is as honest with  it as was with the Calvinists. Did he SEE some of the myopic,  hen-pecking-&amp;-not-happy-unless-they-were-suferring-or-inflicting-pain-on-others-to-sufferer-for-Jesus  Orthodox churches as he was entering the Fold of the Faithful?

You will find priests who are as warped  in modern thought as anywhere else, and while the church seems to have a  good attitude toward children, their stance on women is pretty misogynistic  and mothering is often a lonely endeavor with priests who glorify the  struggle instead of empathise with it.<br />Ware emphasises community but  frankly, these people are not crowding G-d anymore than the other religious  groups that claim to have all the answers. Save your money and get closer  to G-d by going to volunteer on Sunday mornings at a local hospital or read  to elders at a senior center.	1999-10-27

But then I got  into it. Instead of finding The One True Way, I realised that the  &quot;reformed&quot; clergy at my church (all of whom come from someplace  else, originally) were just as legalistic and concerned with what they saw  on attendence records as opposed to how you were spiritually as many  Protestant clergy are-- only worse. There are six priests in most churches  and they don't disagree, so calling one insensitive only gets the wrath of  all of them. Struggling to get to church with six kids? Well they will tell  you to just get up earlier on Sunday mornings (as if this never occured to  a struggling parent.) Your children are a blessing and if you suffer with  health problems while hearding your kids in the narthex of the church  without child care during the service, GOD WANTS YOU TO SUFFER and you'd  better get there on time every time! This book glorifies reasons that  Protestant clergy come to Orthodoxy, but it never touches on the misogyny  within the church that may appeal to a lot of male converts or to the  safety in numbers of being able to act like a jerk. <br />It's easy to honour  the Theotokos-- she is in Heaven. Tell women to think of her suffering and  the suffering of the saints and create more pain for people.<br />There are  some really wonderful philosophies and beliefs within Orthodoxy that Coming  Home speaks of, that probably attract a lot of well intentioned clergy. If  you are seeking to come closer to Christ, you most likely won't get it  through clergy in the Orthodox Church. The God within me hasn't preformed  any miracles or walked on water lately, but He is a heck of a lot kinder  than the one that insulted my wife via various priests (Representatives of  God) who advised her during a rough period of her young motherhood. She  won't set foot inside another church because of her experiences with these  clergy who have &quot;come home&quot; and I don't blame her.	1999-10-27

They are letters,  very brief ones, that are between characters and are just unintersting.  &quot;Dear Mr Owl&quot; I recal one saying, &quot;Please bring back my  tail.&quot; and it is signed Squirel Nutkin. Maybe I am missing something,  but I cannot fathom why the author would send these to her readers. I had  anticipated letters that would illuminate her writings!	1999-10-27
