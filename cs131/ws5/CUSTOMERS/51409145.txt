The book was loaned to me and I enjoyed it. I could only give it four stars, because I felt it slowed down in places. I am interested in reading the others.<BR>Baltimore has become a popular place for crime series. On television there was Homicide, Life on the Street, and the HBO Series, The Edge. It's a fun city to visit and some of this was brought out in the book. The Protagonist Hitch is funny and tart. He should put out a Private Detective shingle on the door of the funeral home. He is humorous next to his morose sidekick, Pete, the real private eye who wants to get out of the business.<BR>Enjoy, tolerate the slowness in the writing at times. A romp through the streets of Baltimore and Rehoboth, Delaware.	2003-12-11

Distant Neighbors is an apt description. American and Mexicans talk past each other without really hearing each other. His best chapters?

This is a subject I am interested in. The only reason I gave it two stars was the easy reading. There was a definite bias in favor of Max and Charlotte. Benito Juarez, a decent man at heart was villifed and referred to as &quot;that Indian.&quot; Max was also a decent man who meant well. That was the sad part of this story that was left unsaid. If you are looking for a cut and dried &quot;black hats and white hats,&quot; you will not get it, except for some of the slime who clung to the Royal couple and convinced him to take Mexico's crown.

The 1863 Draft Riot was the worst event in the city's history before Sept. 11, 2001. Kevin Baker has written a riveting, painful piece of historic fiction that is well researched. For more about New York (then only Manhattan) slum life, read Jacob Riis How The Other Half Lives. Almost all of New York's inhabitants in 1863 lived between the Battery and about 14th Street. The city was crowded and sordid. As horrific as the violence was, you can see why the city's poor Irish finally exploded. In their eyes, they were being sent off to the war, to free people who would then take their jobs. In other words, to use modern corporatespeak, lose/lose. This does not excuse what happen, but explains the context. The author shows you how the violence was so bad, the police couldn't cope and regiments from Gettysburg had to be brought in to stop it. Also read Herbert Asbury's the Gangs of New York to get an idea of what it was like.  It was the worst of times, and Kevin Baker showed us how and why.	2002-10-17

I enjoyed reading it. I do have questions.<BR>My wife, who is trained as an LPN was curious that after he couldn't get a job with his degree he just didn't continue being an EMT. He was already doing it and it's a reasonable salary. Mr Levison could have covered, what made him become an English major. Why didn't he continue to look for ways to persue that, even through his menial jobs. I wonder how much of his problems on jobs stem from his wiseguy sense of humor? (I've been there, and before I gained some wisdom, I know it didn't help). As someone who looked in the present economy for a job, I can't help but think the truth is somewhere in the middle. He didn't help himself. I did learn, that it is easier to get menial jobs. I know. I can walk into my local gas station right now if need be.

Andrew Morton wrote a very readible book. Where I take him to task is I think he ended up seeing Monica Lewinsky like one of his daughters. He has a fatherly feeling for her that denies objectivity (which is why I could not give five stars). He has definite good guys and villains. By the time he was done with Linda Tripp and the FBI agents, I thought they were going to be burned at the stake.

I can't judge it from a religious point of view, but from the fact that I knew the locations and was entertained. It was very funny in places. Tragic at the end, though I expected Pope Bill to die, even before he got sick in Africa. An interesting touch of the common man, making it to the top.

I read it, because I lived in Boston and my wifes' family is from Ray Flynn's home neighborhood of South Boston, better known as Southie. If you read Michael MacDonald's All Souls, this is a good balance showing the good side of Southie. It shows how Southie works politically, and how Ambassador Flynn got to know Karol Woytija long before anyone had a clue, he'd be Pope. No, you will not get a balanced view of the Pope here. (Then again, I was in Poland two years ago, and you certainly wont get a negative word there). There was a lot of humor and a lot of caring. When the Ambassadors daughters had to cook for the Haitian Prime Minister, because the staff had a holiday. Monsignor Monduzzi asking Ambassador Flynn, &quot;how many relatives and friends DO you have?&quot;  I am thinking of writing the Ambassador. I want to know why he REALLY resigned.

I read the review in Library Journal and was just fascinated. The book came, and after reading it, I am glad I bought it. You can use this book for several different purposes. 1. Discussion of Buddhism. 2. A travelog for India and Nepal. 3. The history of African-Americans in the South and what they went through. 4. A History of Universities in the 60's. 5. Personal Journeys.<br />Professor Willis started literally with the odds against her. If she were a thoroughbred in Triple Crown racing, it would have been a long shot bet. Thus, besides brilliance, being in the right place at the right time helps. It also helps that she is curious about things and questioning. You learn about her fork in the road. Buddhism or the Black Panthers. I am certainly glad she chose the former. Her lama, who knew nothing about American Race relations, but understood her personal issues. From that, he produced a Buddhist scholar, who I would be honored to study under. A great book for all personal journeys.	2001-05-03

I read Nicholson Baker's article in the New Yorker long before Double Fold. Most of us became librarians because we LOVE books. We didn't enter it as a secret cabal to destroy them. Yes, it is sad to see these old things go up in flames. What's more important though? Being able to access the history of these items easily or allowing no one access, because they will crumble the moment they are touched. Double Fold is more spewing from Mr. Baker. His bleating over the catalogs was just silly. Our library buildings aren't made of rubber and cannot expand to hold everything. Especially at this time in our history, when more paper than ever is created. First, when Mr. Baker gets his Masters of Library Science, only then will he have just a little more credibilty. By the time he was done in Double Fold, I felt as though librarians were a cross between the Mafia and Genghis Khan's Golden Horde. Since, I have some Mongol ancestry, I guess I will just have to go out and sack an old library somewhere. I am 700 years out of practice to sack Bagdad or Krakow.

Much as I tried, Dr. Orange made me see people, not slogans. Problem solving has to go to a &quot;where do we go from here,&quot; not &quot;You did this to me.&quot; As with any dispute, it can't be solved with schoolyard taunts of who did what and to which and to whom. Now, I feel differently about about anti-Arab acts I committed in college. Age and wisdom have their uses. Just read the book. The writing style is easy to follow. It is hard to put down. All should read it, not just Jews and Arabs. The book can be used as a basis for general problem solving. Read it at your own risk. For you wont be the same coming out as going in.	2000-10-10

I can't begin to fathom much of what happened to her. Luckily for us, unlike her father, she is able to turn her anger into writing and ways of trying to do for others. As a white man who had dated African-Americans, I wish I had thought of the idea of the shirt her boyfriend wanted, &quot;Yes, she is that color all over!&quot; She showed various life changes. We all go through life changes. Hers were different from many we can fathom. This is an intelligent woman, whose writing I have always enjoyed.	2000-09-29

I read this, because I am an Asian Studies major and know who Prof. Schell is. I wrote a Masters Thesis for my MA from Seton Hall in 1982, called Chinese Communism and Its Impact on Tibet. I am basing this review on reading the book and some of the other comments I've seen in the reviews. It is true, we have always had an fascination with Tibet, because of Lost Horizon, Seven Years in Tibet, etc. I cannot see in the book where Prof. Schell played down Chinese heavyhandedness. He also states (rightly so) that no Western Govt. backs the idea of an independent Tibet. They do back the Tibetans not being maltreated. Face it, in the modern world, Tibet does not have the resources to survive as an independent country. If anything, Dr. Schell showed just how silly, many of the Hollywood folks jumping on this bandwagon are. This is just the latest fad for them. Movies about Tibet look great on the silver screen. The same cannot be said for Kosovo, or Sudan. I gave it four stars. Hollywood Tibet would have been a better title. Tinseltown Tibet? I am glad this was written to bring it to the American people. Another drawback with this book is, how many people reading it are just reading it for the stars listed and don't understand ALL the issues. I hope this will spur Americans to read more about China as well. I want to know how far the Hollywood circuit wants to go with this. Are they going to go to Tibet themselves? Be with anti-Chinese fighters. No folks, as much as I respect the Dalai Lama, his best hope for seeing his homeland again in his lifetime is to work out a deal with the Chinese. Religious freedom for dropping independence claims. Yes, there is no more Berlin Wall. Tibet cannot make it on its own. Read the book, and as an American, gain your understanding. Want to help Tibet. Help to educate Hollywood folks in both sides of this issue. Prof. Schell shows, it is more complicated than many would like to think.	2000-09-29

I was curious to read it to learn a little more. I found it to be a good introduction to some of the complexities of  Polish history. For the novice, there get to be too many names to remember  after a while (though a glossary is provided at the end of the book). All  in all, a start to an interesting European country. Good for travelers to  Poland to learn a little more and for students looking for some basics.	2000-08-17

In this book, it was called Invisible Computer. I would have preferred he cover more about modern tools and why they could not be as useful as they seemed. User Experience was  covered and that is one thing many folks here work with. I had to disagree  with some of his examples. He stated that in a modern car, you only need a  speedometer and a gas gauge. I would sure like to know if my transmission  fluid, brake fluid and steering fluid are low. I would also like to know my  radiator needs coolant, BEFORE I am on the side of the road with the hood  up. I thought at times he was too desparate to state how we don't need as  much technology as we have. People will use it if it is there. I didn't  miss not having a microwave or a home computer until I got one. Overall,  interesting to read, but had a hard time agreeing with much of it.	2000-05-16

Let me start off by saying, the book is well written and a quick breakdown of a problem.  (We had a police shooting, in June that is being investiagted, so this is relevant). I grew up in New York City, so I have  SOME idea of how &quot;mean&quot; the streets can be.  Still, there are  ways this book could have been improved. More input from the side of the  police would have been very helpful.  Otherwise, this can easily be  pictured as a small group of rogue cops making it bad for the majority of  good ones.  I found Mr. Burris' argument in the beginning about the cost to  cities persuasive.  As a taxpayer, I would get tired of my tax money eaten  up by settlements with citizens abused by police.   It is an important book  for all Americans to read.  I would, though make some changes to it.	1999-12-30

This was a great way to learn about the war from the people who were watching it.  Nowdays, we have wars such as the Gulf War on television.  Here were the folks who HAD to be your eyes  and ears.  This would be a great book to have high school classes read as a  comparison to seeing a film about Vietnam or Desert Storm, just to see the  contrasts.  History classes in American History and Journalism would also  benefit.  For the general public, unless you are interested in these  topics, it is a lot of detail to absorb.	1999-12-28

As much as you may enjoy the profession, you may have burnout on a particular job.  This book gives you ways to determine if you are burning out and how to handle it.  Two reasons for it not being five stars.  The  author could have cut down on much of the research in the beginning of the  book.  People can look that up elsewhere.  If I am a librarian feeling  burned out, I can look that up later.  What I want to know is; am I burning  out, and what do I do about it?  The second problem is with the Internet  changing the profession, the book needs to be updated.	1999-12-28

The authors premise is that the atmosphere surrouding libraries ends up alienating.  This may be true.  She attempted to wind together the history and how the profession got to this point.  The book looked to be several  papers put together.  I would have clarified, whether it was meant to be a  history of the profession or how to solve present alienation problems.  An  update is needed to show how the Internet has changed libraries. The best  audiences for this, are classes in the history of libraries, library  management and all librarians in the profession.  The book is still useful,  but really could have been several books in a series to cover different  aspects of the profession.	1999-12-28

I was fortunate to meet him  at a school event.  They talked about him constantly and I can see why with  the stories he told his classes that were repeated in the book.

Mr. Herow's book provides information on trains in all fifty states.  The  book is divided by states in alphabetical order with information on the  railroads, such as when they run, phone numbers and maps with the routes  and major local roads.  The back of the book has information on other  tourist sites and places to stay. Four things I would have added. 1.   Whether the railroads themselves are payable by credit card. 2.  Do you  need to make reservations so you don't get there and find out you can't  board? 3.  Photographs of each railroad would have been good.  This would  help people make up their minds about taking a certain scenic railway. 4.   Local transit, airports, Greyhound or Amtrak terminals and their distance  from the railroad should have been listed. Otherwise, for what it does, a  very useful book.	1998-09-20

Emeka, a car attendant for Amtrak is extremely  knowledgable about the service and how you can make your ride as  comfortable as possible.   The only thing I might have changed is that I  would have cut out the first chapter on railroad history.  While  interesting for a train buff, I don't think it added anything.  I did enjoy  his explanations on how to buy your tickets and get the best fare, as well  as keeping fit on a long trip, the dining car, etc.  I plan to buy the book  and carry it with me on any Amtrak trip.

It was a sleepy Southern town, that just happened to be the HQ of the Federal Government.  Anyone interested in American history will have fun with this book.  Much of it is downright funny.  The diplomats who wont talk to each other is like scenes out of the movie Casablanca.  The woman who was told by the Sanitation Dept. to get rid of her bricks by leaving them on the bus.

Francine Curro Cary, Executive Director of the Humanities Council of Washington D.C. proves otherwise.  The book is a series of essays of Washington ethnicity starting with the original Native Americans &amp; working its way to the present. It is an interesting book, but hard to read at one sitting as it is more for a history scholar.  My interest in Washington D.C. &amp; its history kept me going.  It will not help the tourist much as a guide to the major landmarks &amp; monuments.  It is more about the &quot;other Washington.&quot;  The one people actually live in.  I would recommend  only by someone deeply interested in the total history of Washington D.C., or a specialist in American Urban Ethnic Studies.  It is not really for the general public.	1998-05-28

My wife has a friend in the Benton Harbor area; that is what got me to read it.  It spelled out how difficult a time Jim Reeves had investigating the death of Eric McGinnis because of the local climate.  I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because of the following quote on page 111. &quot;Her silver-dollar-size glasses and buttoned-at-the-neck blouse made her look prissy, like a budding librarian.

I remember then how shocked I was when I found out I was among a minority of students who would not need remedial help. My father attended CCNY as well, so he read the book too.   Mr. Traub's portrayal was extremely accurate.  I reread passages to see if there were areas I thought he was mistaken.  There were none.
