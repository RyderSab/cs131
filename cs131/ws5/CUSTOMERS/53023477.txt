I thought it would be a somewhat light summer read.  But was I in for a surprise!  It's more dark than fun, more eerie than uplifting.  At times, I had trouble imagining the events of the book occuring in the 21st century.  Or maybe it's just my lack of experience with British aristocracy, ie the Lord and the Billionaire (2 of the 10 men).  <br /> <br />It's different .... if you want some darkness and eerieness in a novel, read this.  Also, the writing style was quite beautiful.  I'd recommend it for the writing style and the poetry of the words in itself.  It's just not a story that will leave you exhilarated.	2005-08-06

This a fun, fast flowing book, but like its predecessor, The Botox Diaries, I often wonder if these authors wanted to write a novel or two woman comedy show.   There is a quip in almost every paragraph  ... referencing iPods, hamstrings, Carly Fiorina ... every \\"now\\" item under the sun.  And the last few pages are literally like a whirlwind, wrapping everything up with a bow. Not really my kind of novel, but I did have a bit of fun reading it in 3 days.	2005-07-31

Elizabeth Bloom is the married name of the author Beth Saulnier.  I enjoyed all of Beth Saulnier \\"Alex Bernier\\" mystery books ... but See Isabelle Run was just not the best I've ever read.  It seemed so fake and so predictable.  I like it when I can't figure out who's done it ... with this book, I could figure it out all along.  The plot and dialogue is reminiscent of a movie you might see on the Lifetime Network.  Isabelle and Mac seemed exactly like the couple in the Alex Bernier books.    <br /> <br />Elizabeth Bloom should have stayed single in Ithaca!

I had a hard time figuring out what all the hoop-la was about back when this was featured in one of the morning show book club.   It has a great premise and it could go many places, but I found many of the places it went silly and predictable....and even unexplainable.   Some parts of the novel were too engrossed in unnecessary detail that I skipped over sentences here and there. <br />But overall, I enjoyed the unique plot of the novel - very different from the usual &quot;boy meets girl&quot; story.  It may also be interesting to read a mini-novel about Mike's (the accident victim) point of view.

The story and Jennifer Haigh's writing style will keep you intrigued from start to finish.

This is one of those fun books that is easy to read in a day or two.  It's not necessarily a &quot;fun&quot; subject matter, but it's treated lightly enough that it reads as a fun story.  The story deals with a woman whose husband meets someone else (younger)after many years of marriage and 2 children who are now adults. Elizabeth Buchan is a great writer and I loved the funny parts scattered throughout.  I love books that deal with real issues in life where you can see both the serious and funny sides of the issue - and by the time the ending of the story comes around you've learned something in the process.

I read this book in one day and found it a worthwhile read! It's fun, light, and very entertaining. Not too much character development, but that is not the real purpose of the book.

I found it entertaining and very easy to read.  I was a little annoyed at the time that was given to the problems Amanda's husband was having at work...way too much detail for this book.  Perhaps the sub-plot of Bob could be a topic of another book?  I don't know....it just didn't belong here.

The cosmopolitan on the cover just screamed my name.  <br />Who You Know is the story of 3 girls, two of whom are sisters, and their day to day life at work and at play. Each chapter is devoted to a particular woman and talks from her point of view. <br />Not only is it a good story overall, but the characters vocalize their revelations as the story unfoldes and it causes the reader to pause to think as well and realize some things  themselves that the characters explain in the story.  (i.e. the reality of loving somebody who is imperfect...)<br />The only thing I didn't like too much, but which did not preclude me from giving this book 5 stars, was that I found the ending of each girl's story to be a bit &quot;cheesy&quot; as they say.  Too neat for me.  But I still loved every minute of this book. There was still enough non-cheese for me to LOVE Who You Know.  <br />If you are a chick-lit devotee such as myself, this will not disappoint.  Enjoy and happy reading!	2004-02-05

They learn from each other - and the reader, in turn, learns quite a bit about religion, struggle, and friendship.   The book is intense and you will not want to put it down!  It is unfortunate in the way it ends, however. It just is not a believable or even possible ending, in my opinion.  I thought I might have missed a detail when I was reading the events that unfurl at the end, so I even re-read the last 2 chapters - but it still was unsettling, and I didn't miss any details.<br />It's a great book until the ending.  This high quality story deserves a much better ending than the one Pete Hamill chose to give it.  Read this book for the learning experience and 90% of the book - the last 10% is just not the way it should have ended.	2003-05-30

This is Beth Saulnier's 5th installment in the Alex Bernier mystery series and yet another gem.   Read the book and discover the twenty-something reporter/sleuth that is Alex living her life and getting herself into all sorts of predicaments - thanks to reporting and eventually self-investigating mysterious deaths at a music festival.  <br />Beth Saulnier again makes the most of referencing all sorts of Central New York area locales - something I really enjoy about her books, being a Central New Yorker myself. This novel is never boring and will keep you turning the pages to find out what can possibly happen next.<br />I can't wait for the next installment!  I thank a local book club for introducing me to Beth Saulnier!	2003-05-18

And thankfully, I did not purchase the book to begin with.  I thought I would like it because it seemed to come up on ...lists of other books that I enjoyed. But this is where I took a chance and lost. <br />The author is attempting to write a mystery/romance at the same time - which is fine, but the character development, plot, writing, and the author's ability to write a good story is not there at all.  I was annoyed that I wasted my time reading it. It's written in a pre-teen fashion,(something I find insulting in an adult novel), but it's not a pre-teen book due to some of the sexual & violent references.  Don't bother with this book.	2003-05-11

This is the third installment in the Shopaholic series...it's definitley worth reading if you've read the other two - Confessions of a Shopaholic &amp; Shopaholic Takes Manhattan.  I did enjoy reading it, I just don't think it was as great or as funny as the other two books in the series.  If you read this one, make sure you've read the other two first.  You'll appreciate all 3 of them more by doing it this way.  Shopaholic Ties the Knot is disappointing on its own, but overall it is good when read as the third installment of the series.<br />At the end of the book, there is a sneak peek at a new novel that Sophie Kinsella is writing and due out next year - it looks like it will be another winner!!  I am looking forward to reading more of her work!	2003-05-03

In a sentence - it's about finding Mr./Mrs. Right or Mr./Mrs. Right Now at different times for different people in the story.  I enjoyed it - and I don't really tend to go for those novels where the story can be a bit far fetched at times.  For some reason, I didn't mind that so much in this novel.  I don't know quite how to describe it - I would say cute, but then parts of the story are not so cute and may even turn your stomach! I would read this author again. <br />I read in a previous review, an reviewer thought this novel would make a good movie.  I was thinking the exact same thing the other day!!!

Judging from the reviews, this book looked like it would fit the bill.  It did somewhat...I  say that because, well, it actually almost didn't.  <br />I found the first half of this book to be depressing, reminding me that I wasn't a young doe anymore...ugh!  But, the second half helped to redeem the book in my eyes, explaining why 30 was so great.  You can't tell that this half and half action will happen by reading the chapter titles, etc., but it does.  <br />Also - keep in mind that this book is categorized as humor/self help, and it is just that, emphasis on humor.  If you are looking for a psychology perspective, professional advice or something like that - you won't find that here.  The only credentials that the author has are that she once turned 30 herself.  <br />This book is an attempt to make light of it all - but I found it to be quite depressing at times!  I think I am now even more scared about turning 30 than I ever was!  But Julie Tilsner does help you to realize that you are not the only one who is going through this.	2002-10-27

I found this book 3 years after I was married...I only wish it was available around the time of my wedding!  It would have helped me so much!  Reading it now, it helped me to realize that the crazy feelings I was having were ok and even normal.  <br />Some of the things I could do without in the book: the frequent references to mythology and the way the author seemed to imply that in some ways you would become different after the wedding...(I am almost tempted to encourage brides to read this book well after their wedding for that reason).  <br />A great self-help bridal book to help deal with the roller coaster of feelings, emotions, and changing states of mind of the bride.	2002-10-05

Don't let this deter you from reading it. I am SO glad I kept on reading.  I bet if I re-read the first few chapters again I would upgrade my review to 5 stars.  Anyway....<br />This is a wacky story about being with the one you love and loving the one you are with...realizing the truths at every moment...and the search for that one SOULMATE.

There were whole pages where a conversation would take place between two characters where I couldn't tell what character was saying what line...sometimes I had to go back to where the conversation started and figure it out a few times!!  <br />Other than that, Beth Saulnier truly writes with a Gen X appeal and I enjoyed reading about this 20 something gal reporter and   her determination to get to the bottom of the issues....  She has such a great relationship with her co-workers and her boyfriend which is also a wonderful thing to read about.  It's also a wild read because the author, through the character Alex Bernier is pretty much writing about herself....  Beth's (and Alex's) love of the Ithaca area shines through and I appreciate that, being a NY girl myself!!!<br />After reading this book, I longed for some more CNY references and got more by reading addtional books in the Alex Bernier mystery series!!

This novella has further reinforced my thoughts.  It is written so thoughtfully, so provacatively.  I can almost hear him reading the words (as you can hear his commentary in such movies as Father of the Bride, etc.)  He is a true artist.<br />This is clearly Steve Martin's outlet for social commentary - you wonder if he has experienced this in his life - older man with younger woman, and all the fun and crazy times that may go along with that.  He must have - this novel reveals too much into the lives of a twenty eight year old and a fifty something year old. Plus, he is VERY descriptive!!<br />Great, provacative book, quick read.

I think I may be the only reviewer who did not care for this book.  I found it unrealistic and unprofessional. A nurse should not be doing the things she is doing in this novel.  Also, the &quot;ugly duckling&quot; syndrome carrying over later in life theme is something I cannot stand reading about, where someone never feels like they are pretty or worth anything.  This is something that the main character, Myra, suffers from.  What a way to make a reader feel bad!! I feel sorry for Elizabeth Berg if she actually felt this way in her life.  But to give a character in a novel these traits is inexcusable.  It just reinforces the idea amongst other vulnerable people/readers that if you were quiet when you were young then you are ugly. AND THIS IS NOT TRUE!<br />Overall, sappy &amp; unrealistic.	2002-01-07

Sad to say, I was not impressed with this book.  It's Jemima J meets I don't know who!!  The story line seemed so hokey, predictable and unbelieveable to me. At times you want to knock some sense into Cannie for not having the self-confidence that I know is somewhere inside of her.

I am sure it caused quite a stir when it was first published.  I think it has lost much of its impact over the years.  You really have to read between the lines to figure out what is going on.  Maybe that is part of the beauty of this literature or maybe I have been out of AP English for too long.  The plot of the novel, however, is timeless.  A woman coming of age, falling in love, dealing with consequences, choosing paths.	2001-07-11

I am very happily married now, but I can remember just a few years back when I was single going through the exact same things that Libby was going through.

I am so glad I did....I got some Bridget Jones and some sociology all in one in &quot;Cause Celeb.&quot;  Part of this book deals with love relationships and the other parts deal with world hunger.  An interesting combination...and a very good book that I found hard to put down.	2001-05-28

I am going to have to take a complete opposite view of the reviewer before me.  I thought this book was truly horrible.  I hate to say this as I do believe in writing as an art, but this book and this writing is truly an embarrasment. How did it EVER get published?  <br />I found the story line to be slow and CORNY.  The characters would liken one event that was being told in the story to a completely unrelated situation elsewhere.  I could not stand that!  <br />The book jacket summary of the story sounded interesting and that is why I took it out of the library.  Unfortunately the story was boring and the writing unimpressive.	2001-04-29

That is what sparked my initial interest in the book.<br />I am so glad I read it! It not only gave me some insight into Stevie's world, but it is also quite a compelling story.  At first, it was very creepy...I almost was scared to continue reading it.  But as the story went on, it became so interesting, other-worldly, and almost ethereal.<br />If you are interested in Stevie Nicks, myths, legends, and even a little bit of psychology, I recommend this book to you highly!<br />This is a very good story of a woman struggling with issues of both the past and present n her life.	2001-04-09

I saw this book in the library and decided to give her a second chance.  Am I ever glad I did.  What a unique set up of a book...it is both a collection of short stories and yet a series of connected chapters all at the same time.  I loved Hoffman's writing style and insight into this group of people. It shows what a diversified and deep writer she really is.  You will enjoy growing with all of characters in this book.	2000-12-12

Now, I normally don't enjoy all of the &quot;sappy&quot; content that this book is made of...but Amy Yurk has a way of writing and  developing characters that makes you feel as if you are their best friend.<br />Sometimes you think you have the worst problems in the world...this book helps you to realze that maybe you don't.  Sometimes you wonder why your marriage isn't as perfect as everyone else's seems to be...this book helps you to see that every marriage has its good parts and its not so good parts.<br />This book takes you through one of the scariest challenges of a woman's life....watch how the main character deals with the hand that life has dealt her...you will be inspired...and humbled.	2000-12-10

Disobedience was nothing like her past novels.  I had a hard time getting through it.  I found the civil war reinactment very odd....actually the whole book was odd.  It ends with somnewhat of a meaning.   I didn't finish it unsatisfied, just mystified as to how Jane Hamilton came up with such an odd plot.  It didn't reach me as her other novels have.  (I have not read Short History of a Prince...though at this point I think I am afraid to).  Good luck to those who try and get through this novel...	2000-11-22

The wit of this book follows the same wit as Bridget Jones...with an American Sex and the City (several VERY different girlfriends and their lives) line-up.  This book is both a comedy &amp; a drama....very well written.  <br />It's hard to believe it could happen, but it gives an open look at a new marriage and the excitement and pain of infidelity.  Can it ever be forgiven?  Do vows mean nothing to some people these days?  Read this book and find out.  It will pull on your deepest heartstrings.	2000-10-27

Instead of saying that this is a novel about &quot;ugly ducklings and  swans&quot; why don't they just say &quot;this is a novel about fat people  and skinny people?&quot;  Jane Green has committed a major blunder for  womankind with the writing of this book.  The plot is stupid: fat girl  falls in love with hot guy..loses weight so he (according to her) will love  her....etc. etc.  (don't want to give away the whole story...)  Yes, I read  it very quickly, but only because I wanted to see what stupid thing would  happen next.  (And believe me, stupid things run RAMPANT in this story).   <br />This story thrives on the principle that you need to be skinny &amp;  beautiful in order to have friends, boyfriends, a good job, a sex life,  etc. This is not how the world works.  I am offended that a woman would  write such a novel like this.  <br />Yeah, it's just a story, but why write  something so unrealistic that it just winds up sounding stupid?	2000-09-12

I did not care for it at all.  Yes, it is about a woman and her mid-life adventures.  I found the sequence of events to be very unrealistic and  downright corny.  If you want a cutesy-tootsy rosy story, read this book.   If you want some brain stimulation, steer clear.  Also...typos are littered  throughout the book.  Very, very poor editing.	2000-07-22

I found this book (as well as Midwives, my 1st Bohjalian book) intriguing.  This is a look into the life of a transsexual and the people they are surrounded by  at a given point in their lives. This intimate look into their lives is  probably a look most people will never experience, but are always quick to  judge.  At times, the story line was a bit uncomfortable and I did not  agree with all that happened...but I found the story, the characters, and  the character's choices quite intriguing.  I have learned something and I  think probably have become a better person from reading this book.	2000-07-11

Anna Maxted has truly written a gem of a first novel.  I found myself laughing out loud at Helen and her trials and tribulations.  The chicken at the window had me chuckling to myself all  afternoon long!  <br />I recommend this book to any 20-30 something woman  dealing with careers, men, family, life...who just wants to get a kick out  of the crazy things another 20-30 something is going through in all of the  above.  <br />I'd love a sequel!   Anna, you are brilliant!	2000-07-06

This was one of the &quot;4's.&quot;  I didn't like this novel at all.  I thought the turn of events in the novel were so outrageously unrealistic &amp;  insane.  This may sound strange, but they were so crazily unrealistic that  you could PREDICT what would happen by just thinking...&quot;what would be  the most crazy thing this character would do next..?&quot;  And they would  do it!    It literally reads like a bad soap opera...where crazy things  happen just to keep you in amazement of how insane some people are.  I  don't even feel as if this book is worth any stars at all.   I also felt as  if the way March treats herself and allows others to treat her is a great  insult to females everywhere.  Not to mention the insult that Louise  Justice is to females.  Most of the book left me with a sick feeling in my  stomach.  STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS, WOMEN!   If I could, I would have given  it ZERO stars.	2000-06-28

I enjoyed it and learned alot more about Hillary Clinton.  I admire her for her intellect, determination, skill, and her presence and power as  an American woman.  She truly inspires me, although I am not sure that I  can trust her.  I question her ethics and whether her mission is for the  good of the people of NY or the good for HER.  This book has helped me to  think more about her and whether or not I want to elect her to be my next  senator.<br />An overall good book that gets you thinking.	2000-02-10

Ms. Stoddard encourages you to take time out and invest quality time in YOURSELF, which I have always believed to be  important, I just didn't know how to convince my husband!   This book  helped me find those words!  Once you have yourself taken care of, then you  can concentrate on your relationship and it will THRIVE!  My only complaint  is Ms. Stoddard writes as if we ALL live in Manhattan and drink cappucinos  everyday...I found her comments like that throughout the book to be  annoying and assuming.  Overall, the book makes sense....and has made me a  more relaxed person!	2000-02-10
