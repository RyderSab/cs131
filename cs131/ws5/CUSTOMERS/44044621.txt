I used this text for a Graduate Level Civil Engineering class while working on my Masters.  This is a good introductory text for understanding the basic concepts of advective and fickian transport of contaminants of concern.  The concepts presented can be applied to pretty much any chemical.  The text covers basic concepts, chemical distribution of phases, mechanisms responsible for physical transport, air-water exchange modeling, Redox reactions, dissolved oxygen modeling,determining partitioning coefficients among phases, transport within the subsurface enviornmental and processess within the atmosphere.  I found that the section on Bio Accumlation Factor (BAF), Bio Concentration Factor (BCF), and determining the increasing concentration within each trophic level within the food chain of the system to be weak.  Each chapter within the text is full of problem sets but there is no solution guide which would be helpful.  I would recommend this text, however, I would also supplement certain sections with additional reading as required.	2005-01-09

I found this to be a very poor text to use.  The textbook presents a very qaulitative approach to geochemistry of natural waters and does not lend itself to quanititative problem solving.  I purchased other texts on ths subject so that I could cross-reference and determine how to setup problems for equilibrium chemistry.  I would not recommend use of this text.	2004-06-17

This is very similar and almost identical to Drever's text.  This is not a text that should be used for quantitative problem solving.	2004-06-17
US	44044621	R2ULMIKMWI04RH	0471051969	494985977	Water Chemistry	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Definately the Best	I used this book as an alternate text for a graduate level course in chemical hydrogeology.  This was by far the best textbook I used.  The class text and most others that I used were qualitative texts.  This book presents a quantitative approach to equilibrium chemistry.  This definately helped clear up several topics and is full of plenty of examples.  At the end of the chapters there are suggestions for additional reading and many practice problems.  The authors present cchemical kinetics, equilibrium, acid-base reactions, coordination chemistry, precipitation and dissolution, and redox reactions.  This book is definately helpful as it goes through many problems step-by-step and is very instructive.	2004-06-17

More quantitative than most of the other books avialable.  I found it somewhat useful.  There are plenty of problems at the end of the chapters and the text covers more topics than Drever or Kehew.  Langmuir covers thermochemical principles, kinetics, complexes, acid-base reactions, carbonate chemistry, silicate weathering, adsorption-desorption, redox reactions and computer models.  This is a worthwhile textbook.	2004-06-17

The text also discusses Laplaces equation, iterative methods including Gauss-Seidel/SOR.  Chapters are dedicated to finite difference and finite element methods under steady-state and transient conditions.  It also demonstrates how each element is handled separately using finite element method and then the equations are assembled into a conductance matrix.<br />This text is a very good complement to other modeling texts.  However, if you want to learn how to set up your hydrogeologic conceptual model, what data is needed to develop a good model, how to choose your numerical model, verify, calibrate your model, interpret results and perform a post audit, this is not that text.  For the purpose of model setup etc. I would recommend Applied Groundwater Modeling.	2003-05-05

US	44044621	R3OYDJ4XB6TA4	0133653129	173088075	Groundwater	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Groundwater	Overall a very good book. This is the text our Hydrogeology professor, Dr.J.Toth used in the 80's. It covers a great deal of information on facies,flow nets, hydrologic cycle, chemical evolution, groundwater resource evaluation, contamination, groundwater processes and a really good section on chemical principles and mass action. This is not a quantitative text, the discussions on finite difference and finite element methods include very little math. I would have also liked to have seen a better discussion of well hydraulics. I still turn to it for a reference as it is a very useful book.	2003-04-19
US	44044621	REFCPGLDWQUUG	1566700914	786169444	Applied Hydrogeology for Scientists and Engineers	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Quantitative Hydrogeology	This book takes a quantitative approach to groundwater flow, aquifer properties, and aquifer test analysis.  Chemical properties, hydrologic cycle, evolution of groundwater and resource evaluation are not discussed here.  This book is intended for those who wish to gain a better understanding flow characteristics, steady-state, porous and fractured medium aquifer testing and analysis.  The chapters on aquifer tests are well done especially the section on nonlinear flow where Darcy's law is inadequate for high Reynold's numbers. Many of the diagrams are hand-drawn.  Overall a really good book.  I would recommend it to those who want more than that found in the introductory hydrogeology texts.	2003-04-19

Everyone in first year had this book and we used it regularly right up to fourth year.  It came in very handy for mineralogy, especially since we had to know 200 of the rock forming minerals.  The color pictures and information about each mineral and rock (including accidentals) and the geologic environment was very helpful.  This book even came in handy when we were working on a gold exploration program coring through volcanic rock.  It was helpful trying to match up the pictures with the rocks we were logging.  Of course I don't recommend this practise but we all did enjoy the joke in camp. <br />This book has also been helpful when I used to work on large scale field mapping projects or drilling programs.  I still have my original copy.  I definately recommend this book above all others I have seen to any rock hound, hobbist or student.	2003-04-19

Appendix A presents physical, chemical and fate data for priority pollutants which I have found helpful. Overall this is a good text and is a useful reference.	2001-11-14

This book is great because there have been times when I have been working on a problem (effective poristy, density and saturation) and have been able to find an example of it in this book.

Chapter 2 focuses on characterization and remedial investigation.  This section can be useful for those who do UST investigations and soil removal.  Here the author runs through the steps used to determine mass and volume of soil excavated from a tank pit and mass and concentration of excavated soil.  There are also many useful subsections describing the procedure for determining mass and mole fractions of gasoline components, contamination in the vadose zone, etc..  The author also presents calculations for determining well volume for groundwater sampling.  Chapter three covers plume migration in groundwater and soil and the author covers such topics as transmissivity, specific yield and storativity.  These topics are not covered in great detail.  Aquifer tests are covered and some simple examples are used demonstrating the Theis Method, Cooper-Jacob Straight Line method and Distance-Drawdown method.  Not a lot of detail in these sections.  Remaining chapters cover mass balance, vadose zone and soil remediation, groundwater remediation and VOC air treatment.  Overall a good reference text with a great deal of applicable information.	2001-11-13
