Then we fast forward to the time of the ruling Taira (Heike) family in 12th century Japan.  They are overthrown by the Minamoto family faction.  At that time, one of the symbols of the emperor, the ancient sword named Grasscutter was lost in the Inland Sea.  The Heike crabs in the sea, have the appearance of the lost Heike warrior's faces (Google the image of these crabs, they are amazing!).  Fast forward again to Usagi and the ongoing plot to restore the emperor to power and overthrow the shogun.  In this volume, brilliantly as ever penned and written by incomparable Stan Sakai, Usagi stumbles literally upon Grasscutter.  The conspirators had enlisted supernatural powers to secure the sword, and it is up to Usagi to prevent Grasscutter from falling into evil hands.  Other highlights of this volume include Usagi's on-again, off-again bounty hunter sidekick Gen, and the supremely evil Jei, emissary of the gods.  Sakai never fails to disappoint and is able to maintain an amazingly high standard for his graphic novels.	2005-08-27

After completing just the first essay in this volume of his collected columns, I realized my life had been the poorer for not reading his works before.  Steingarten enthralled me from the beginning.  Whether it is his quest to cook the perfect pizza, a huge undertaking including measuring temperatures in pizza ovens, timing baking, making exhaustive measurements in dough preparation (recipe included), his quest to make the ultimate hot chocolate (yes, recipe included), or his expose on whether there truly is a unique flavor to sea salt (no recipe included), Steingarten takes us on adventures we never knew existed, but now cannot do without.  He eats around the world (though in this book most often to France), and we mentally eat with him.  Steingarten is able to capture the essence of flavors, the excitement of discovering new foods, and the stories behind much of what we already eat.  His essays are populated with learned chefs, butchers, writers, farmers, almost all professions related to food.  There is never a dull moment in this highly entertaining and informative (a rare combination) book.	2005-06-23

Nevertheless, there still some way to go.  In this installment, Greg Grom, a not-so-bright yet somewhat lucky, head of a small US protectorate Caribbean island, has stumbled across an ancient secret powder that can be used to enslave men and women.  While originally using it for his own pleasure, with the aid of a conniving bikini model-turned-tourism minister, they seek independence and later some unhatched and undescribed scheme for making lots of money.  Alas, nothing so James Bondian, as bringing together the world's top master criminals and auctioning it off to higher bidder.  Unfortunately,<br /><br />Grom has used up much of the original source of his powder in his infantile exploits and tries to have an exact replacement synthesized.  As he travels the US on his publicity campaign for independence of his island, he is dosing people on the side to test each of the new batches of his enslavement compound.  Alas, they all seem to have the side effect of turning the poor victims into murderous maniacs.  And this is where Remo and Chiun step in.  What stands out in this episode, Remo begins to show a glimmer of deductive intelligence.  And what is a big disappointment is that Harold Smith does not.  Clearly, the author wanted to show, after all these years, Remo is beginning to develop intellectually.  However, what the author does best is the too short segments showing Chiun trying to determine what his place and role should be as Master Emeritus.  Bloody Tourists zooms along with all the action and zing you would expect of a Destroyer, as well as some, though not enough, cultural sarcasm.  However, the big disappointment is the ending, which comes together all too fast, and leaves more threads hanging than an old tapestry.  Instead of the usual clean wrap-up with maybe a few menaces left for the future, this book ends well short of that.	2005-06-12

This collection includes a story, \\"Return to Adachi Plain\\" inked by none other than Sergio Aragones.  This, of course, is icing on the cake.  In this book, we journey with Usagi as he almost killed by a Ronin (masterless samurai) who actually bests in him in a duel (a rarity in Usagi's universe) in \\"The Withered Field\\", watch as he encounters a beneficial ghost in \\"A Promise in the Snow\\" and an evil one in \\"The Obakeneko of the Geishu Clan\\" and step back in time to his childhood in \\"The Courage of the Plum\\".  Included is one of Stan Sakai's non-Usagi stories set in the same time period \\"The Patience of the Spider.\\"  This is one of the most poignant stories of Sakai's that I have read.  A general defeated in battle becomes a farmer to hide from his enemies.  When his chance for revenge comes years later, the long and difficult jouney has changed the general into an even greater man than when he went into hiding.  I would highly recommend this book to the Usagi fans and novices alike.	2005-05-30

This is not a book that you read from cover to cover, but one that you pick up from time to time and read something edifying, grotesque, or engrossing.

It harkens back to the day when the Communists were the Bad Guys, the West were the Good Guys, and all's fair in propaganda and war.  Although the world has changed a little bit since then, Le Carre's story is still griping and nail-biting, full of spies, double-agents, triple-agents and the like.  This book is able to keep hits hold on the reader because his austere plot, centered around the infiltration of Britain's spying-ring inside East Germany and the British spymasters attempt to fight back, is a framework on which Le Carre has developed the psychology of spying.  No one is ever quite who they seem, and as the motivations and actions of individuals blur into an ever-shifting moire field, the behavior of the various organizations are even harder to sift out.  But that is all part of the fun.  As the reader tries to figure out what will happen next, and gets stymied by each subsequent twist, you get more sucked into travails.  And the twists keep on happening right to the very end.  It is because of this brilliant writing that allows Spy to remain fresh and sharp after all these years.	2005-05-01

However, few of these stories deal with space travel, aliens, or the world of the far future.  Some of them deal with the near future, some with an alternative universe, one, which is very fitting for the Spam age, a pseudo-alternative universe.  With a uniquely Japanese sensibility to society, these stories are not only entertaining, but allow the reader with a view into present day Japanese culture.

Rather than use the nefarious South Seas pirates as models, the current ghost author has a crew of malcontents sailing the Caribbean, wreaking havoc, kidnapping, killing, all under the guise of 18th century pirates.  Unfortunately, although these pirates are quite successful, when the author trots out the individual characters they ooze incompetence, and so their exploits seem all the more unbelievable.  Of course, Remo and Chiun are sent in to the rescue, but some very clever high points in the story are coupled with some parts that drag.  Couple that with some very uncharacteristic-like behavior on Remo and Chiun's part (e.g., Chiun allows himself to be repeatedly insulted, behaves subserviently, and expresses faith in Remo coming to the rescue), we have the latest in a mediocre string of Destroyers as this ghost author attempts to craft clever stories while staying true to the Destroyer heritage.	2005-04-17

This solid piece of Grisham writing is a painless way to learn about the greed and mechanics of class-action lawsuits, especially for those of us who received some worthless coupon.  The big payoffs are for the lawyers.  We follow a hard working lawyer seduced by the dark side of greed and money (where have we seen this before).  Although Grisham's excellent writing and fast developing plots suck you into the story so that it flies by.  Besides the main character, Clay Carter, whose motivations in abandoning the Office of the Public Defender for the lucrative lure of grabbing 30% of the settlement of a massive class action lawsuit are explored.  The rest of the characters are 2 dimensional props to be moved around and interact with Clay.  The relationship with his girlfriends are as stunted as the lawbooks he studied in school. Nevertheless, the highly entertaining storyline is able to partially make up this deficit.  Paying the price of the hardback is not worth it, but the paperback is.	2005-02-27

He is a one man show, doing the artwork and the story.  Although all the characters of this series are animal-like humanoids, you think of them as people rather than as animals.  However, their animal characteristics underscore the personality traits of the individuals. In this volume, Usagi Yojimbo, the rabbit ronin who is doomed to wander medieval Japan tastes the life fishermen, and runs into the usual cast of characters who populate this series, e.g., the thief Kitsune (in a very poignant story about the cruelty of the age), and Chizu the neko ninja.  The brilliance of the Usagi Yojimbo series is the combination of artwork that alone can tell the story, and a plotline that engages the reader rather than just entertains.	2005-02-13

Remo and Chiun are up against a loup-garou (werewolf) who has been enhanced by none-other-than Dr. Judith White (evil villain from the previous Destroyer installment).  The loup-garou and his wolf-human pack have been hired out by a mobster to off and eat witnesses for the mobster's trial.  Remo and Chiun need to save the one remaining witness from becoming the next wolf meal.  The real entertainment in this book comes not from the main plot line, which is ho hum, but from the brilliant description and desecration of Louisiana politics.  There is also a clever take on Mexican soap operas, though nothing like the one-paragraph soap-opera summaries that were absolutely spot-on in the early installments in the Destroyer  series.  It seems that the current ghost author is still getting his Destroyer legs.  We see Remo interested in a female lead, and absolutely nothing happens between them.  Also, the feel of the dialog between Remo and Chiun is not quite right.  Alas, there is not as much of CURE director Harold Smith and his assistant Mark Howard in this book.	2005-02-12

In addition, calligraphy in Chinese culture has achieved a recognition and respect as an art form that has never been matched by its Western counterparts.  Jean Long has written a very readable book that provides an excellent overview to the history of Chinese writing from the tortoise shell oracle bones through bronze inscriptions, pottery vases and, of course, calligraphic scrolls.  Also, the author provides basic instructions for how to hold a brush, grind ink, and write a few characters on your own.  Given the breadth of the material, the author covers it well, but this book, on account of its brevity, serve as an introduction to whet your appetite.

The dark sides of the \\"Gentlemen\\" are emerging as we see what the Invisible Man and Mr. Hyde are capable of.  Besides the wonderful righting, the illustrations both capture an imagined Victorian era and mix it with the horrors we could only imagine today.

The father and son team of John and Alex Dent-Young have done a brilliant job of translating the Shui-hu Zhuan by the 14th century author Shi Nai-an from ancient Chinese into contemporary English.  Although this is the 2nd volume of the 5 volume book, this review easily applies to all 5 volumes.  The novel is set around 1100 during the Northern Song Dynasty. The story revolves around 108 heroes from throughout China who fall afoul of the law or the corrupted law, as the emperor is surrounded by evil and malicious advisors.  The series describes how each of the herores makes his way to the Marshes of Mount Liang, a giant outlaw sanctuary.  The theme is that the heroes would like to serve the emperor (who himself as the son of Heaven is blameless), but the Imperial Court is infested with corrupt vermin.  The first half of this series describes the gathering together of these heroes.  There are a number of adventures after all have reached the marshes and are seeking the Imperial Pardon.  And then after they are pardoned, that last book deals with their work under the emperor and the ill fates that happen to many of the party.  Besides creating a translation that flows very smoothly (despite being over 2000 pages in all 5 volumes), the Dent-Youngs have used epithets and nicknames for the Heroes (e.g., Twin Rods, the Monk, Opportune Rain, White Water Dragon, etc.) that make it much easier for English speakers to follow the actions of the different heroes.  Otherwise, it would be like sorting out the characters of a Tolstoy novel, but worse.  Another plus to the translators is that they have not shied away from the cannibalism, crude language and other violent descriptions that previous translators had felt necessary to edit out.  I have read all 5 volumes and heartily recommend them all!	2005-01-08

He begins with an analysis of just how neglected this country is from our current media.  Ask yourself, when was the last time you saw an article in the newspaper about Australia.  Fortunately, Bryson has set out to do justice.  While relating his adventures wandering around the country on long drives that most of us would fly over, he also fills us in on the history of this island/continent, beyond the commonly known convict dumping ground part.  Despite being keenly aware of all the dangerous and deadly snakes, spiders and jellies, Bryson manages to make it through unscathed, despite the hunger of some very mean dogs.  He also discusses the unique ecology of the land, and the various problems caused by introduced species:  rabbits, foxes, camels and others.  This is all done with great humor, and his description of cricket radio commentary had me roaring with laughter.  Equally interesting are Bryson's descriptions of Australians, contemporary individuals he meets on his wanderings as wel as the famous and infamous from history.  For those who wish to explore some more of Australia, there is a valuable bibliography at the end.	2005-01-08

He focuses on the geology, discovery, mining, and cutting of these valuable gems, stopping, for the most part, before going through the retail door.  There are entertaining stories of famous named diamonds, the Hope Diamond, the Centenary Diamond, the Koh-i-Noor and others.  Of course, as with any discussion of diamonds, the story of De Beers looms large.  However, Hart is able to evaluate this company in the perspective of its role in history and how that is changing today.  He also describes how with valuable mines being found in Canada, Russia and Australia, the shift of power is moving away from Africa.  Hart is able to capture the excitement of discovering these new mines, as well as the difficulties and pressures that abound in the pursuit of diamonds.  As with any recent diamond book, the issue of War Diamonds is explored, but because diamonds are easy to transport and mix, this story is far from over.  There has been much in the news about outsourcing of manufacturing of many industries to countries like India.  One of the interesting chapters is the one about how India is the largest diamond cutting and polishing country now.  The one criticism I have is that the book does not follow a coherent thread but tends to jump around from topic to topic.	2005-01-08

In this reprinting, updated with an afterword, of Richie's travel around the Inland Sea more than 30 years ago, he has captured a world that was then disappearing and now almost gone.  This reviewer is, admittedly, not a huge fan of travelogues.  However, Richie's prose flows beautifully.  The reader is able to see through his eyes and experience the isolated islands of the Inland Sea.  Although there are some photographs, one does yearn for more.  The map of Richie's journey is printed across 2 pages, and there is a bit lost in the middle.  Nevertheless, these are minor problems.

In some ways, this book is depressing because how time and time again the current administration has shown itself to be anything but fiscal conservatives.  For 3+ years, the government has waddled from the bad policy of tax cuts as a cure for surpluses, deficits, war, you name it.  Krugman addresses these issues from an economists view and delivers insights that cut through the political jargons to the heart of the matters.

Although, Salmon was well worth it, it is a mixed bag of writings, musings and interviews.  There are some absolutely brilliant parts that make the book well worth reading, e.g., nonfiction pieces such as &quot;The Rhino Climb&quot; and &quot;Riding the Rays&quot; or fiction works such as &quot;The Private Life of Genghis Khan&quot;.  The eponymous unfinished book presented at the end gives a mere glimpse of where Adams was going with &quot;Salmon,&quot; but reading it, I could only imagine how much better it would have been when finished and what a loss the world suffered with his untimely death.  Then there is the filler used to bulk out the book which detract from the better parts.

If there is any evidence that the media is not liberal slanted, just compare the overwhelming attention given to misstatements from Bill Clinton or Al Gore, to the absolute lack of attention given to lies of Bush and Friends.  If the media were so liberal, just the opposite would be the case.<br />  Besides the attention to facts, truth and details, the biggest difference that separates Franken from the blowhards on the right is that Franken has a sense of humor.<br />  One can only hope that the media picks up just a few of Franken's points during the upcoming election season and show the lying liars for what they are - major prevaricators.	2003-09-28

I found this book to be fascinating.  Belinda Martineau has written a very accessible book that has something to offer every reader.  The scientific background allows the non-scientist to be able to understand not only what made the Flavr Savr tomato, but all the different regulatory issues involved to show that the product was safe.  As such, it reveals how much of the anti-biotech sentiment is based on ignorance of scientific facts rather than on demonstratable dangers.  Indeed, as was the case of Calgene, any company worth its pipette tips (and knowing the highly litigious society in which we live) would not want to release a hazardous product, but would want to do all the safety studies.<br />  The interactions and conflicts between the scientists and business side of the company reveal important lessons for any biotech company.  These problems underscore the importance even more for getting the 2 sides to interact from the beginning in a meaningful way.  The hype that was generated before a product was produced foreshadowed the dotcom bubble, but an important difference in biotech (and especially plant biotech) is that product development (often 7-10 years) usually takes much longer than a high-tech product.  This book is must reading for anyone who is interested in the current debate about genetic modification of foods.  It is also valuable reading for anyone who is interested in biotech industry (especially if one is interested in investing in this industry).	2002-07-30

They are surrounded by one or non-dimensional characters who are poorly developed, if at all.  Enid and Becky are as unsympathetic as anti-heroes can be.  And as such they fail to evoke an empathic response in the reader.  At least this reader developed an antipathic response instead.  They are dour, pessimisic and feel superior.  Yet, their comments are neither clever nor entertaining.  Basically, I didn't [care] what happened to them.  Because no one else was developed, that left no one to peek my interest.	2002-07-13

Terry Jones writes in a style evocative of Douglas Adams.  Unfortunately, his ending was as slapped together as in many of Adams's books.  However, this short book has the same type of parodying humor that cleverly makes fun of our current society and mores through the views of several wacked out alien cultures.  Alas, this book is short, so instead of being published as a novella, the font and line spacing are cranked up to double the page length.  As 3 humans stumble onto the ill-fated Starship Titanic on a brief voyage around the galaxy, one can see the  imprint of Douglas Adams's brilliant mind on the adventure.  And who better to write an absurdist book than a former Python.	2002-07-13

Too many words are devoted to the author's whining about not understanding or fitting in to the culture.  For example, the traffic is not the complete chaos as described.  The traffic laws and signals are used as loose guidelines that lead to an elaborate ballet-like movement of cars, motorbikes, scooters and pedestrians.<br />Another problem is that the book is a series of vignettes, some of which survive on their own, some of which just mystify the reader (a set of diary excerpts about some fashion show is one example) because they are not placed in any context.  Alas, there are few books describing Taiwan from an American viewpoint.  Yet, with the high price for a slim paperback, I would only give this book a half-hearted endorsement.	2002-07-07
