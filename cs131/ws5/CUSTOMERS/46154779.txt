Christian, the Duke of Jervaulx, is a compelling character, and his recovery following a stroke is enough to break your heart.  Christian is almost totally dependent upon Maddy, who is not very dependable, dwelling too much upon her own needs at times when Christian most needs her.<br /><br />I recognized the \\"flowers from the storm\\"--following a thunderstorm, Christian picked some Michaelmas daisies for Maddy and she threw them on the ground.<br /><br />Christian has to battle not only his illness but his family as well--along with his banker, his manager, the \\"doctor\\" and the Lord Chancellor--and Maddy's mood changes, and she is not always there to help him.<br /><br />This was a long book but I was sorry for the story to end.<br /><br />I rated it with five stars because I'm glad I read it and will never forget Maddy's and Christian's love story.	2005-07-27

This was truly an outstanding book, and I am now searching for more by this author.<br /><br />Catherine seems to have little choice but to marry Charles, whom she had not previously considered a suitor, and they seem to be ill-matched.  But Charles, although stoic, is a caring and sensual man, and Catherine's previously unchecked temper lessens under his loving attentions.<br /><br />There is a homicidal maniac on the loose and Catherine becomes his target.  Despite Charles's attempts to protect her, the killer is wily and determined.<br /><br />This story is both exciting and romantic.  I adored Charles and came to appreciate Catherine, as well as the supporting cast.	2005-04-12

This story has been a long time in the making, but, as usual, Ann Rule tells it with her usual classy style.  Even though, by the time I read the book, I knew the name of the GRK, I appreciated the fact that Ann took me all the way through the investigation and spoke of the killer in the third person until he became a viable suspect.<br /><br />Ann told us all she knew about the victims; of course, she learned more about some than others because some had family members who cared about them.  And she told us what she knew about the GRK.  She wasn't a part of the investigation and wasn't privy to everything the Task Force learned, but I definitely learned more than I wanted to know about this unfeeling monster who apparently accepted it as his God-given right to rape and murder.<br /><br />I couldn't believe the negative reviews I read here, and I was disgusted by the reviewer who thought she should have described the rapes and murders.  He's looking for his reading material on the wrong shelf.	2004-11-16

Although I haven't read &quot;Scandalous,&quot; I enjoyed &quot;Irresistible&quot; tremendously. If there's a third book in the &quot;trilogy&quot; I haven't yet found it.<br /><br /> Although there was much more description than conversation, the plot was magnificent. Even so, there wasn't quite enough description regarding Claire's kidnapping, just a backward look. The story opens after she has already escaped her kidnappers, only to be captured again by others.<br /><br /> I'm not a reader who requires that fiction imitate life but rather prefer a GOOD STORY (which is why I adore the Madeleine Brent books), so Claire's adventures made for a great read.<br /><br /> Perhaps I should have given it five stars--I really wanted to assign it four-and-a-half--but, in any event, I would recommend this one to anyone who isn't just looking for a fast bit of fluff.	2004-08-03

This book is definitely an exception to my rule.  Whitney's story was so wonderful I just kept wiping the tears so I could continue reading.<br />Whitney certainly had self-esteem problems and Clayton obviously had his own hang-ups which were difficult to understand, but the story itself was superb.  If a story is set in the early 1800s, I don't expect it to be &quot;fair to women.&quot;  Surely readers can set aside their personal issues enough to enjoy a story and, if not, perhaps they should stick to modern stories.<br />Other reviewers have outlined the plot sufficiently.

I hesitated to buy this one because it's a &quot;first book&quot; for this author.  However, I found it to be a fully-developed, suspenseful story.<br />Prosecutor C. J. Townsend is caught up in the biggest case of her career--the &quot;Cupid&quot; serial killer case.  When a car is stopped by police and a young woman's body is discovered in the trunk, everyone is elated that the sadistic killer of ten or more women has been found.<br />However, C. J. discovers a link between &quot;Cupid&quot; and her past.  She agonizes over what to do--prosecute the case because she is the attorney most familiar with it or recuse because of a conflict of interest.<br />The interaction between the characters was warm and human.  We didn't learn much about C. J.'s caseload beyond the &quot;Cupid&quot; case--just enough--and the legal problems presented made sense.  I truly enjoyed this one and hope Ms. Hoffman will write more.	2004-03-02

If you want to know about Salvatore Lucania, a/k/a Charlie Lucania, a/k/a Charlie Luciano, a/k/a Charlie Lucky, a/k/a Lucky Luciano, this is the book for you!  The author relates Lucky's story from the cradle to the grave and, while some of it sounds self-serving (wouldn't we expect that?), Luciano tells all.  It's an amazing story, from taking pennies from schoolkids to being the Boss of Bosses.  It has always been known that Luciano refused to traffic in drugs and prostitution, and his only prison terms were for those very things.  I wondered why, and now I know.  I also wondered about the time he was \\"taken for a ride\\" and the story related by Luciano had the ring of truth.<br /><br />Luciano was candid about authorizing hits and the nature and extent of his criminal enterprises.  The author was non-judgmental in telling the story.  After all the half-truths and guesses about this man, I'm glad I read this book.<br /><br />If Charlie Lucky had chosen an honest life, he could have been the most successful businessman in history.	2003-11-10

I'm glad I did--it's a real page-turner.  If you've read some of the other reviews, you know the basic story--deaf girls being held hostage by bad guys.<br />Mr. Deaver draws his characters well, and each one has strengths and weaknesses.  Some of the hostages are survivors because they're always on the lookout for ways to survive, while others give up without a fight.  The bad guys are really bad but the good guys are surprisingly normal.  There are no supermen in the story, only regular people responding to a bad situation as best they can.  And just when you think it's safe to breathe again, the suspense builds anew.<br />That's what makes Jeffery Deaver's books so extraordinary.  Sometimes I get the feeling Lincoln Rhyme is a little too superhuman, but all of Deaver's books are like intricately woven tapestries that tell stories with richly colored detail.	2003-11-04

I was moved to tears several times while reading the story, and the plot was intricate and suspenseful.  Every time you thought things couldn't get worse--they did, and it was difficult to sort out the good guys from the bad guys.

I've read all of Irene Pence's books, but this story is so tragic it haunts me.  It makes you wonder how things might have turned out if the laws applied to everyone.  It appears that Texas is a good-old-boy state where \\"domestic abuse\\" is fine as long as the man is doing the abusing.<br />Is there anything we can do to get law enforcement to do its job?<br />Ms. Pence often uses \\"trustee\\" instead of \\"trusty\\" which breaks the flow of the story for me, but she is a very good storyteller.<br />(For all you non-perfectionists, a \\"trustee\\" is a person appointed to administer the affairs of a company or to hold property in the name of another; a \\"trusty\\" is one that is trusted, esp. a convict considered trustworthy and granted special privileges.)	2003-10-14

Thus we are able to follow the events surrounding the writing of &quot;Envy&quot; as well as the unfolding story as it is being written.

Cook, and he always delivers.  &quot;Breakheart Hill&quot; is no exception.<br />It's hard to review any of Mr. Cook's stories without giving away too much of the plot.  Even though the story jumps back and forth between past and present, it was simple enough to follow along.<br />The power of the story comes from the resentment and unrest surrounding the first attempts at integration.  Kelli Troy, having come to the South from Baltimore, is naturally more sensitive to such issues than the local youth who have been exposed to racial prejudice from birth and see nothing unusual about it.  Indeed it would be impossible for them to view the situation with an unbiased eye.<br />One sunny day Kelli is attacked on Breakheart Hill, and the reader fears learning the truth, for the list of suspects is wide-ranging.  Although Lyle Gates is tried and convicted for the crime, the reader can't be sure he was the one . . . .	2003-08-04

There aren't enough stars or adequate words to give this book the merit it deserves. It was in the \\"true crime\\" section of the library, and I mainly picked it up because it was one of the few I hadn't read.<br />What a pleasant surprise to find a rather ordinary story told in such a bewitching manner! By reading Mr. Brock's words, I felt that I was familiar with the atmosphere and living conditions of Allie and Link, Maggie and Ham, and the other players.<br />Allie Hale is in the prison of a loveless marriage to her former schoolteacher when her younger sister, Maggie, marries handsome Ham Dillon. The subsequent affair between Allie and Ham is not only predictable but perhaps inevitable. Allie's biggest mistake was probably giving birth to a 12-lb. boy that she hoped her husband would believe was premature, but then she named him after her lover. Link, however, could add two and two and, when confronted, Allie confessed all.<br />The broken-hearted Link repeatedly attempted suicide (with and without asking his wife to join him) and eventually decided he needed some intensive treatment. He was on his way to the Kellogg's institute in Battle Creek, Michigan, when he met his rival on the street and put five bullets into him.<br />Every aspect of this story is fascinating--the rivalries, passions, and betrayals as well as the mundane and ordinary are spellbindingly told.	2003-08-04

Personally I like him better when he doesn't get so emotionally involved (i.e., Die Trying) but I enjoyed Persuader from start to finish.<br />Jack becomes embroiled in an off-the-books undercover operation for personal motives.  He's among brutal, untrusting people--with limited ability to communicate with the good guys.  Lee Child's plotting is wonderful, and Jack Reacher is more than a macho man.  He uses his brain more than his fists and knows his limitations.<br />I had no problem distinguishing the past from the present--even without italics.  The past was fed out in just the proper increments to explain Reacher's present thoughts and actions.<br />Mr. Child, keep 'em coming!	2003-07-14

This story begins with a murder and then investigates it.  Suspects are found and either eliminated or investigated further.  The solution was so obvious once you got there but the plot was so cleverly devised that you didn't figure it out until you turned that page.<br />If you want to learn more than you need to know about the book, read the other reviews.  Better yet, read the book.<br />Unusual for a T. Jeff story, I did make one correct guess early on--usually I find something out when he's ready to tell me--but it didn't help much with the solution of the crime.  I dismissed the clue I should have picked up.<br />The story is rich with solid characters and their personal, working, and family relationships.  Tom McMichael investigates the murder of Pete Braga realistically, picking up leads and following them to their conclusion.  And the subplots are equally well-developed--the generations-old family feud, McMichael's past involvement with Braga's granddaughter, and his on-going relationship with his son, to name but a few.<br />I have no reservations in rating this book the five stars it deserves!	2003-07-10

He was a criminal because he failed to control his impulses--unless it was in his interest to do so.  Even if his upbringing did not include such lessons, his experiences should have taught him that certain actions have certain consequences and it would be a good idea not to keep repeating them.<br />This was my first in-depth look into a life of crime that I thought was believable.  All in all, Mr. Bunker is to be commended for giving readers the opportunity to see inside jails, prisons, reformatories, etc. and the people who inhabit them.	2003-07-03
US	46154779	R25L4XEIG0LWNL	1559706643	918070082	Black Dahlia Avenger	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Interesting and informational	This book was interesting reading and contained a lot of background information that I didn't know about other similar murders in L.A. during the same time period as \\"Black Dahlia.\\"  However, Mr. Hodel supposedly is lightning struck by the idea that his father might be a murderer after seeing photographs of a dark-haired girl that he concludes is Elizabeth Short.<br /><br />That's his starting point.  How he came to that conclusion I have no idea, because neither of the photos looks anything like Beth Short.  He eventually made some good points with the handwriting comparison, but he should never have gotten that far.  He keeps repeating that he has \\"proven\\" that George Hodel did this and did that, but I didn't see any proof other than his insistence that he \\"knew\\" it was so.<br /><br />This book is certainly worth reading although I didn't feel the mystery had been \\"solved.\\"	2003-07-03

I agree completely with &quot;a reader from NJ&quot;--the Sherrys apparently were not nice people, and they crossed the wrong people time after time after time with no thought of consequences.  Mr. Humes is an excellent writer, and he certainly researched this book well.<br />The Kirksey Nix blackmail caper was borrowed by John Grisham in &quot;The Brethren&quot;!	2003-03-10

I have this incredible book on audiotape, read by Scott Brick (the absolute best), and I've listened to it time after time.  The story hits a little too close to home, especially since 9/11, with its repeated references to the World Trade Center.  The hunt for the (may I say it?) brilliant terrorist has you biting your nails into bloody stumps.  John Corey is a hero for our times.  And we need to face the fact that terrorists are not the fools we wish they were.  \\"The Lion's Game\\" should be required reading for complacent Americans who take our safety and liberty for granted.	2003-03-03

The three stories in \\"Strangers in the Night\\" are all excellent, although \\"Lake of Dreams\\" is my personal favorite--the ending is perfect.  In \\"White Out\\" the suspense is almost too much to bear . . .	2003-03-03
US	46154779	R3369GM8JPQGN7	0671017063	224080330	The Cases That Haunt Us	Books	4	1	3	N	N	He profiles the classics . . .	but doesn't necessarily shed new light on them.  The first difficulty is Mr. Douglas's massive ego.  The second problem is that, regardless of how unbiased he thinks he is, he cannot look at these cases with a fresh eye.  I found myself disagreeing with almost all of his \\"most likely\\" suspects and felt that he disregarded relevant information because it didn't fit his theories.  I do think that if Mr. Douglas had profiled these cases with no preconceived notions, the outcome would have been significantly different.<br />The book is an interesting look at several famous cases, but don't expect to know whodunit when you finish this book.	2003-01-03

Jack Reacher has my vote, whatever he wants to run for.  This character is so solid, so capable, so intelligent, and so human that I'd like to write him a letter.<br />It's hard to rave about Mr. Child's books without giving away important points of the story.  Practically the minute Jack Reacher arrives in the small, perfect town in Georgia, he is arrested for murder.  The chief of police swears that he saw Jack at the crime scene, and Jack is forced to spend the weekend in state lock-up, where he must fight for survival.  But Jack has an alibi for the time of the murder and is released.  However, the killings are just beginning . . . .<br />I sincerely hope we will be having Jack Reacher adventures well into the future.	2002-01-28

But it's more about what happens when the The Perfect Crime meets Murphy's Law.  Mostly I read for entertainment, and this book was extremely entertaining.  Oliver Caruso believes everything he's told, and his brother Charlie believes nothing until it has been proven to his satisfaction.  Although both work at the same private bank, their jobs (and personalities) are far from similar.  The story takes us from New York City to Disney World with an amazingly solid cast of characters.  And it should have a sobering effect on how you view the power of computers.	2002-01-28
