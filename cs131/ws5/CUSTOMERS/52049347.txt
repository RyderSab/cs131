It is very light and quirky with some deep underlying social commentary.<br />If you have never read Mr. Vonnegut's works beofre, this is a great one to get started with.

It's a great sci-fi read with pleanty of classic sci-fi premisies with a few twists.<br />One of the nice things about this series is that it ends.  Once you get excited about reading these books and become attached to the characters, you can simply pick up the next book and continue on.  There is no waiting through years of writers block or movies deals (a la Robert Asprin and JK Rowling).<br />Yes, it's sad that a series you enjoy ends, but at least you have the sense of completion and closure to the story.  Since no series can go on forever it's nice to finish strong.<br />This, as the first installment, is a great read on it's own merits.  It's a great story with great characters.<br />If you're a fan of books like Starship Troopers (book NOT movie) and Ender's Game - I think you'll like this book and it's sequels.	2002-08-02

As far as a self-contained (meaning without 3, 4, 5 or more sequels) this is defenitely one of his best works.<br />The premise of the book is fascinating, and the way he deals with the special &quot;skills&quot; of each of the &quot;families&quot; shows great insight.<br />I purposefully shy away from discussing the plot and characters of the story for fear of ruining an enjoyable read.  For those of you who read and loved Mr. Card's most popular book (Ender's Game) - I believe you will truly enjoy this book as well.	2002-08-02

It is an extremely entertaining and fast read.  It is defintely on of Mr. Card's best works.  But even if you love this book, be careful on it's sequels - they are very different in story and tone.  If you're looking for a great follow up - try &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; - which is the same story told froma different character's point of view.  I know it sounds kind of forced and trite, but it is actually very good and will give you what you want if you're an Ender's Game fan.	2002-08-01

Not that the sequels to Ender's Game were bad - they just weren't what I believe most fans of Ender's Game were craving.  Ender's Shadow tells the story in Ender's Game from a different character's (Bean) perspective.  I know it sounds kind of forced and hackneyed - but it actually is very entertaining.  If you're looking for more of Ender's Game - this is the book and not Speaker For The Dead and the others.  If think it's closer to the Card of old and a better effort than many of recent works.	2002-08-01

If you are a fan of Mr. Card's writing then you will probably enjoy this book - but BEWARE!  It strays quite a bit from the light story telling and fun of Ender's Game and is a much &quot;darker&quot; book.<br />I enjoyed it, but only when I looked at it on it's own merits and not as a sequel to Ender's Game.  Unfortuately, Ender's Game is a must read if you are going to really follow the characters and story in Speaker for the Dead.<br />I guess it's hard to follow Ender's Game - but did Mr. Card have to take such a turn away from what made Ender's Game great?  Still a good read on it's own merits - just don't have Ender's Game-type expectations.	2002-08-01

It is slow to get going and in fact pretty much stays slow.  If you were disapointed with Speaker for the Dead, then this book will probably be even a bit more disapointing.  It is more of the same (from the style of Speaker for the Dead) - and contains little of the excitment of Ender's Game.<br />Mr. Card is an excellent writer and the book itself is good (not great) - but it doesn't satisfy the craving for the characters and excitement in Ender's Game.<br />I only compare it to Ender's Game because it is, of course, the third in the Ender's Game series.  On it's own merits - it is a good book although fairly slow.<br />Look to Ender's Shadow for a book more along the lines of Ender's Game.	2002-08-01

It contains Mr. Larson's notes and comments on some of his most popular cartoons from the past 10 years. It also contains interesting information about his beginnings as a cartoonist and even some early darwings and drafts of his work. He takes you through some of the thought processes in creating his strip as well as including interesting anticdotes about his life as the author of the FAR SIDE. It is a must own for fans of the FAR SIDE.	2001-07-14

None would argue that Danny Inosanto is one of the leading authorities on Filipino martial arts and his book demonstrates his depth of knowledge. It is complete with pictures and diagrams, making a lot of the information relatively easy to learn. Learning any type of movement from a book is difficult, but this book does a pretty good job of making the information clear. If you can find a pretty inexpensive copy (under $30.00) grab it! It's a collectors item as well as a great martial arts reference.	2001-07-14

It breaks each trick down into it's parts and expalins it in a physics type manner. It's not that easy to follow, and it reads kind of like a text book, but if you can get through the complex explainations it's got some stuff you've never seen in a yo-yo book before.<br />If you want to get deeper into some complicated yo-yo tricks, this book is for you.	2001-07-14

Points on the body to strike and what effect a strike to that area might have. It isn't a &quot;death touch&quot; or &quot;instant kill&quot; kind of goofy voodoo psuedo martial arts book.  It is more of a basic anatomy book for martial artists. It is very interesting but not very through, but how could it be at 92 pages especially when many of the pages are simple black and white photographs. An example of one of the pictures is a woman biting a man's ear.  Does one really need an expalination AND a picture to figure that one out? Over all, an interesting book with good information.	2001-07-14

One of the reviews complained that it wasn't &quot;practical&quot; and I would argue that any information read in a book is going to be just part of the puzzle.  The techniques in this book are sound, but you cannot expect to gain a practical knowledge of ANYTHING from one book. The diagrams are well done, but due to the complicated nature (foot work, hand positioning, etc) it is a little difficult to follow some of the technqiues. Overall, a good book with some really good technqiues. Worth owning and learning.	2001-07-10

It's easy to read with little &quot;quizes&quot; all the way through. It's got great info on the origin of kata (names and creator), information on japanese martial arts terminology, and some interesting &quot;general martial arts knowledge&quot; info. For example, they say that a well executed martial arts punch can generate 600 foot/pounds of pressure and that bone has a structural strength greater than that of concrete. Are these stats true? I'm not sure, but it makes for an interesting read.	2001-07-10

This book is interesting and entertaining BUT I wouldn't risk my life of the knowledge contained in it. It seems they found &quot;experts&quot; to answer each of their worst case scenarios, but with the very limted space dedicated to each &quot;scenario&quot;, the particality of the information is questionable. Besides, most of it is common sense type stuff anyway. But, rergardless, it's a fun little book and worth a read.	2001-07-10

It's not a text book style book on the dusty history of the English language.

Out of the three &quot;Big Secrets&quot; books, this one is the best.  &quot;Bigger Secrets&quot; and &quot;Biggest Secrets&quot; have some great stuff in them as well, but there is also a lot of &quot;so what?&quot; information in them.  Perhaps a little &quot;padding&quot;. The first book, though, has some great stuff. Especially entertaining are the items about things you find on money and the info on Disneyland.

Earlier reviews discount the value of this book, but keep in mind no training book can offer all of the information on a given subject.

It is a throw back to one  of my  personal favorite martial arts books, &quot;Moving Zen&quot; (C.W.Nicol).  His story of his training in one of the most brutal of martial arts  programs available in Japan gave an interesting insight to the way martial  arts is thought of and taught to foreigners in Japan.  The prejudices and  attitudes of the Japanese towards foreigners and the attitudes of the  westerners towards the Japanese was very interesting.  The book is a  very entertaining read - complete with pleanty of opportunities to laugh.  Take a few hours and read it.	2000-08-29
