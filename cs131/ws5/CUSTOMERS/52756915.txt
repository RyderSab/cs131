The set is beautiful and I am very satisfied with the look and feel of the paper and binding as well as the price. As for another reviewer's comment that it is not really a hardcover book, I cannot agree. It seems to be well bound despite the fact the pages are not sewn, but glued. I guess time will tell whether it is an inferior binding. The weight of the paper and quality is certainly better than \\"The Complete Far Side Collection\\".<br /><br />The set begins with an autobiographical introduction by Bill Watterson recounting his career in cartooning from beginnings in Chagrin Falls, Ohio and at Kenyon College. His early rejections and sudden success, as well as his refusal to forgo all merchandising are also briefly explained, as are his battles with the newspaper editors and syndicates over the half page Sunday cartoon formats. Even briefer is his description of his post-Calvin and Hobbes career that has been we learn spent at learning to paint. I would have liked a little more detail about his Calvin and Hobbes experience, but clearly it is up to us, the readers to decode this.<br /><br />The Collection of cartoons is wonderful. Long ago I lost or lent out my paperback books, so it's wonderful to have all the cartoons in one collection and to relive both my childhood with my own stuffed Tiger and the years 1985-1995 when I eagerly turned to Calvin and Hobbes in the Washington Post every morning before reading the News. What does it all mean? For me Calvin and Hobbes is a separate world, a sort of parallel universe, a mixture of the Comic Strip and my childhood memories combined into one. It made me realize years later that my early opinion that grown-ups are crazy was essentially true, but then I did not realize that until I was a grown-up myself. It's a pleasure to have this collection and I will savor reading it slowly. I recommend it highly. It's not just a cartoon about a boy and a Tiger, but much more. The wonderful thing is, that it's up to the reader to figure this out on their own.<br /><br />Review by Walter O. Koenigbout a boy and a Tiger, but much more.

They seem to specialize in what some might call the more \\"exotic\\" or \\"unusual\\" languages, such as Sicilian, Uzbek, Twi, Sanskrit, Macedonian, Nepali and in this case Nahuatl. (None of the dictionaries I have listed have an average customer rating higher than two stars.) These books are not concise, and are arguably not even dictionaries, because for example, the Nahuatl-English/English-Nahuatl (Aztec) dictionary lacks any type of critical apparatus or source material commonly found in dictionaries. Also, as the previous reviewer pointed out we do not know whether this is a dictionary of Classical Nahuatl or of current Nahuatl dialects. My guess it's a combination of the two, which makes matters even more confusing. The small 6'' x 4\\" x 1\\" format suggests that these books are to be carried in the pockets of travelers and that they be used as guides, so that words such as airplane, polishing machine, crocodile, and observatory can be said to the \\"natives\\" when traveling in rural Veracruz, Tlaxcala or San Luis Potosi.<br /><br />But the book is not completely useless, it is the only dictionary with an English-Nahuatl section and when used in conjunction with the dictionaries by Karttunen or Molina it can be helpful for translation. The back of the book also contains a reference section with every day phrases, numbers, parts of the body, animals, colors etc. but as with the English-Nahuatl section this needs to be used with extreme caution. Unless you have other dictionaries do not rely on this book.<br /><br />Review by Walter O. Koenig	2005-05-12

Second, Harrison had access to materials, mainly photographs that have not been published before. Third, he was able to interview several persons close to Bacon, notably John Edwards, Bacon's last companion. Fourth, and most importantly, the book has a clear thesis that the author is able to present convincingly. It is Harrison's position that Bacon used mainly photographs either taken by photographers by his request or from books and magazines to the effect that they: \\"triggered decisive turning points in his stylistic development\\" (from book jacket).<br /><br />In five chapters Harrison explores different type of media and images and how these affected Bacon's painting: Motion pictures, Interior Design, different artists such as Picasso and Michelangelo, the photography of Eadweard Muybridge, and the photographers that he hired to take photographs for him such as Deakin and Edwards. From the thousands of objects found in Bacon's studio at his death many were photographs from the above mentioned sources, but also taken from magazines and torn from books. Of these many had paint splatters and finger smudges in paint proving that Bacon used these for his paintings. A cut out photo of George Dyer, Bacon's lover from the 60's until his suicide in 1971 was even used as a template for several paintings. For many paintings Harrison shows the painting and the image or photograph that it was based on side by side. For example the Triptych (1991) used a front cover of \\"The Correspondent Magazine\\", a Muybridge photograph of mane wrestling, and a photo of Bacon. The book has over 270 excellent illustrations, of which at least 100 I saw for the first time and I own an extensive collection of Bacon books and catalogs.<br /><br />The fact that Bacon used other images for inspiration does not mean that he merely copied these. One look at Bacon's paintings will prove that this is not the case. It is well-known that Bacon did not use models for his paintings and the images acted as catalysts for Bacon triggering other images, emotions or memories which then manifested themselves in his extraordinary paintings. Bacon was always reluctant to discuss the meaning of his paintings, insisting that they had none. Harrison goes farther than any book since the Sylvester interviews in proving that this is not the case and that the paintings were highly personal. The following two quotes from the end of the book are in my opinion right on the mark:<br /><br />\\"..it should be remembered that most of Bacon's paintings  were explorations of selfhood\\". (p.228)<br /><br />\\"He conveyed his inner life without compromise, but in code, in his paintings.\\" (p.229)<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Bacon's art and Bacon the artist and man. The book is well presented, written and organized and the many images are fascinating. Though published by Thames & Hudson, it is printed and bound by Steidl an excellent German printer.<br /><br />For more information on books about Francis Bacon, please see the listmania list I compiled.

Surprisingly there is next to nothing available about Carrington, and the few books that are out of print only give very little information about her and not enough illustrations of her work. Hence this book was long awaited and is certainly the most extensive book yet published about this original, mysterious and fascinating artist.<br /><br />In the foreword the author explains that the object of the book is two fold, to outline the artist's life and to provide an overview: \\"of the full scope of her work<br /><br />in painting, sculpture, drawing, printmaking, and theatrical set and costume design\\" (p.9). If both of these objects would have been realized this would have been an extensive work and valuable work.<br /><br />The biographical portion of the book attempts to give a biographical sketch of Carrington. The first chapter covers her life from her birth in 1917 in Lancashire, England, to a wealthy Catholic family, as a rebellious adolescent, to her insistence against her family's wishes to attend art school. The second chapter describes her relationship with Max Ernst, their life in France and her \\"induction\\" at the age of nineteen to the Surrealist movement. Thee third chapter tells of her war time experiences which included being separated from Ernst who was imprisoned as an enemy alien in France, being put in a Spanish Insane Asylum, breaking with her family and marrying a Mexican Diplomat so that she could get out of war torn Europe. The fourth chapter begins with her move to Mexico in 1943, her marriage to Emerico \\"Chiki\\" Weisz, about whom we learn next to nothing, and her emergence as a mature artist, which coincides with her friendship with fellow surrealist painter Remedios Varo. Aberth explains that Carrington and Varo were inseparable and saw each other almost daily for decades. They shared interests in bizarre cooking, the esoteric, alchemy, witchcraft, cats, and of course painting. A look at the painting of the two artists from this time shows a remarkable similarity in subject matter, style and colors, yet both remain distinct. It seems obvious that they deeply influenced one another in many areas. These four chapters are the most interesting of the book and read as a most improbable life story. It is also in the first four chapters were the problems of the book start to show. First of all, there is a heavy reliance on the books by Whitney Chadwick who has written several books on Carrington and on Janet Kaplan, the biographer of Remedios Varo. We are given less and less facts about Carrington's life and it becomes increasingly obvious that very little primary research, if any at all went into this book. This becomes most evident in the last chapter of the book that describes the last fifty years of Carrington's life in barely five pages. The readers can also ask themselves what happened in this period when she became recognized internationally as an artist. Did she remain married? Did she continue having mental problems? What did she do after Varo died? Why did she move to the US? Why did she return to Mexico? How did she deal with success? Was she re-united with her family?<br /><br />The book reproduces about ninety of Carrington's works. Almost all of these are paintings. There are a few sculptures and one photograph of set design and costumes. Only a few paintings are described in any detail, so the readers have to fend for themselves to try decipher the symbolism and meaning. Most of the illustrations are of fairly high quality, but some are too small. The last photograph of Carrington dates from ca. 1960, so we have no idea what she looks like today.<br /><br />The book fails to deliver on both of its \\"objects\\" to provide an overview of both life and work, and in that respect it is disappointing. Very little is said about Carrington's numerous published books, which could have been used as source material to a much better effect.<br /><br />Still this book is valuable as it is the only book about Carrington and her art currently in print and it will hopefully attract many readers and new admirers. I can only hope that a Catalogue Raisonais similar to the Remdios Varo Catalogue published a few years ago will be forthcoming with more critical information about Carrington's work. A detailed biography would also be welcome. Despite all of my reservations, I still recommend the book highly, because of Carrington's bizarre life and interests and her exceptional original talent as an artist.<br /><br />Review by Walter O.

I don't know why they are offered separately, as Volume 1 also contains the introduction and Volume 2 the Index, so it makes no sense to purchase these separately.  Also the pagination is consecutive.  The brief introduction explains the criteria used to define a Clipper Ship, which is a ship \\"...of peculiar construction, designed for great speed rather than for capacity.\\"  (p.v) The authors Octavius T. Howe and Frederick C. Matthews consider the \\"Ann McKim\\" launched at Baltimore in 1833 to be the first Clipper, and the era of the Clipper to be over by 1858 with the launching of \\"The Star of Peace\\" at Newburyport. The books are basically listings of all 352 known Clipper Ships arranged alphabetically. Some entries are brief; others however are quite lengthy and include excerpts of contemporary descriptions in the Press and in Correspondence.  It seems that the Sailing Records of Ships were of great interest to the authors, so the records of the fastest voyages on several routes can be found in these books. The Index includes not only the names of Ships, but also of Captains, Owners and Builders. Also included are reproductions of about 100 paintings and some drawings. These have not fared so well in the reprint edition, and their quality is sometimes not so good, but many are still helpful.  This almost 800 page long book can be used as a reference book, or as a book just to page around. Original editions are quite hard to come by and expensive, so this reprint edition is very reasonably priced and a welcome addition to any Bookshelf of Maritime History.<br />Review by Walter O.

Roller is without a doubt one of the most gifted, imaginative, original artists I have ever encountered in my Art Journeys. Circa 1987 I saw one of his paintings, and I have been a devotee ever since. Most persons will remember him, (and remember him they will if they have ever seen one of his paintings) as the guy who paints monkeys, cats and dogs wearing clothing, and for the flying pickles, cucumbers, cigarettes and other airborne objects. But there is much more than that, much more. --- If you buy this book, you will be able to enter Roller's world at Brenda's Nut Farm, Mrs. Jenkins' house, and all the other \\"places\\". And what a world it is. Use the adjectives of your choice. I will not indulge in that here. It has to do with an Asparagus experience a young Roller had when his grandfather showed him that Asparagus...Well you figure it out. It's a strange trip indeed, but one that is worthwhile --- On the surface, at a first glance, his paintings may seems crazy and off the wall, but have a look at the technique, the painstaking attention to detail, the original ideas and, well you'll being to realize more and more that here is an artist who is...Roller --- This book is a perfect showcase. Lavishly illustrated with many beautiful color plates, well printed and well bound. It's the best Roller book there is. The text is for the most part by Roller, because only he can really explain it all. If you are lucky enough to own this book, you are fortunate indeed. It is one of my favorite art books. --- Excuse the sort of disjointed review, but this book is really beyond review, because the art is as well. If you buy, it you'll see what I mean.  If you don't, stick to something safe instead.<br />Review by Walter O. Koenig	2001-07-30

I recommend that this is read first, because it helps one to understand the history of Loteria Cards in Mexico and the traditional iconography associated with them. They are actually the fusion of two games, Patolli a game of chance the Aztecs played, and Loteria a European Version of Bingo. In the game the name of the Loteria card is called out rather than the number. It may be a type person, an element or feature of nature, or something elses, and it is often accompanied by a phrase or poem by the caller to further identify the picture on the card. This is origin of the cards, a fusion like so many things in Mexico, has been put into a contemporary setting in this book.<br />Artemio Rodriguez uses a mixture of traditional iconography and modern images to produce beautiful Linocuts for the images of the Loteria Cards. They look both traditional Mexican and old (they remind me of woodcuts by D&uuml;rer), yet contemporary and modern at the same time. Each is distinct and unique.<br />The poems by Juan Felipe Herrera go very well with the Linocuts, and they too are a mixture of traditional Mexican, Chicano and modern subject-matter. They show that beliefs, feelings, and emotions carry over in time, space, language and culture. Some remain the same, while others change. The mix they create is in a constant state of metamorphosis, becoming undefinable, yet staying distinct.<br />The presentation of the book is beautiful, the cover, binding, paper, and printing are al well-done. Each page has a Loteria Cards and a poem that accompanies it. I really recommend this book. It is a thoughtful and beautiful present to give to someone who appreciates the combination of tradition, modernism, art, poetry...	2001-06-07

Already from the introductions of the directors of these institutions, as well as a Preface Essay entitled &quot;Times&quot; by Umberto Eco, the reader will be aware of the high standard of this publication. It is an attempt to depict the human experience with time in all its forms.<br />The catalogue is divided into five main sections: 1.) &quot;The Creation of Time&quot;: A brief survey of early concepts of time in different cultures, for example, Biblical, Hindu, Native American, and Maori.  2.) &quot;The Measurement of Time&quot;: The different modes of measuring time beginning with early calendars in different cultures, progressing to early european mechanical clocks, and culminating with chronometers and radio controlled clocks.  3.) &quot;The Depiction of Time&quot;: In Painting, Sculpture, Calligraphy and Allegory. From Breughel to Chinese Sculpture this chapter shows the obsession of depicting time in art and in symbolizing it. 4.) &quot;The Experience of Time&quot;: Here other ways of experiencing time are discussed, in music, historical time, human time and time in culture. 5.) &quot;The End of Time&quot;: A brief chapter in which different conceptions are shown how it would be possible for time to end (and when) and different historical and contemporary depictions are shown.<br />Sections 2.) and 3.) are by far the largest, which is obvious from their subject matter, and the fact that this is an exhibition catalogue. Interspersed in all five sections are interesting essays on different aspects of time and its influence and pre-occupation on human beings, by well known scholars such as E.H. Gombrich. These range from &quot;Inuit Time&quot; to &quot;Time in the History of Medecine&quot;. Most fascinating are the hundreds of excellent illustrations, mostly of time keeping devices and time in art representing many cultures and time periods.

The section &quot;For Further Study&quot; contains some insightful information regarding the patterns of Pynchon's borrowings, the chronology of the novel and its structure as a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;, which is according to Weisenburger as follows: &quot;(1) the disclosure of the hero's miraculous gifts (2) his education (3) his testing during a course of travels, and (4) the confirmation of his powers, a revelation.&quot; (p.7) I wish this subject would have been developed further. It certainly offers another avenue for reading the novel and analyzing its structure.<br />The &quot;Companion&quot; Section itself gives helpful intoductions to each episode and somewhat brief descriptions of the many allusions and references. The vast majority seem to be included, though further information about them, will in many cases require the reader to do some work.<br />At the time I read this novel, I was conducting research at the Library of Congress, so I decided to check around fifty of the references listed in the Bibliography. I checked verything from the &quot;History of South-West Aftrica&quot; to &quot;Ballistics of the Future&quot;, and Stendhal's &quot;Life of Rossini&quot; to Pavlov's &quot;Conditioned Reflexes&quot;, and found that both Pynchon and Wiesenburger did the their work well. If you really want to understand the allusons in this novel, you may want to check some of these out.<br />The Book ends with a helpful, but not comprehensive Index. I think this book is a most usable and reliable guide to the Novel. The Novel can be read without it, as has been pointed out, but half the fun is, at least to me, checking on the allusions, and coming across their often hidden and surprising meanings.

Kant the man has been caricatured as an anti-social celibate pedant who lived his life with mechanical accuracy. This much needed full length Biography of Immanuel Kant is well-researched, well-documented and well-written, and goes a long way to removing these erroneous assumptions.<br />Kuehn, Professor of Philosophy at Marburg, Germany, begins by outlining a history of Kant Biographies, starting with the three biographers who knew Kant personally, Borowski, Jachmann and Wasianski. He concludes with Stuckenberg (1882) and Vorl&auml;nder (1924), the last true biographers of Kant, making an excellent case that a full length Biography was much needed. He is correct in the assessment that Kant's correspondence is one of the best, yet underutilized sources. His thesis is to prove how Kant's intellectual path is more closely connected with biographical details of his life as has been previously assumed, and how Kant's life was much more diverse and more full of human contact. In this Kuehn succeeds well.<br />In nine remarkably even Chapters, both in paginal and chronological length, Kant's Life and work are discussed together. This is very difficult to do, and requires someone who is knowledgable in Philosophy and whi is also a good writer, which Kuehn obviously is. He makes a series of excellent observations, documenting them amply with the 1,656 Footnotes. I will only mention a few here because of space limitations: Kuehn writes correctly that though Kant was much influenced by the values of his parents, his Philosophy was not influenced by Pietism. Also correct is the contention that K&ouml;nigsberg was by no means the out of the way provincial town it has been portrayed to be. On the contrary, Kant had much contact with persons of many cultural backgrounds and social standing, and the University of K&ouml;nigsberg was more advanced than other German Universities of the time. Of great interest are the descriptions of University life, of Kant's lecturing style, and his relationships with students. It seems that Kant was also gregarious and sought after in society. He was witty, well mannered and by all accounts an excellent conversationalist. He was not a recluse at all. Not having a house of his own until the age of fifty-nine, he ate in pubs for over thirty years. Of great interest is also the variety of friendships he had, with students, with the English Merchants Green and Motherby, and with the Novelist von Hippel, to name a few. Especially Kant's early life was far from methodical.<br />Interspresed with all of this biographical information are carefully written discussions of all of Kant's writings, and his philosophical development. By putting these into the context with Kant the man, they are much easier to understand. The discussion of the writing of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; and the desciption of the book itself, its Philosophy, is the most readable and easiest to understand account I have ever read. Truly well done, as this can also serve as a useful introduction to Kant's Philosophy. The thesis here is that Kant's Critical Philosophy was not the result of a sudden inspiration, as has been pointed out elsewhere, but the result of many years of methodical work. Kuehn also correctly identifies some of Kant's misguided work, for example, &quot;Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime&quot;.<br />The criticisms I have of this book are errors in quotations, for example of Kant's correspondence and citations from the Critique of Pure Reason and of the misuse of apostrophies in German. These seem to be proofreading errors. In addition, there are many excellent illustrations of Kant, his contemporaries and of K&ouml;nigsberg available (see Uwe Schultz &quot;Immanuel Kant in Selbstzeugnissen und Bilddokumenten&quot;), thus the choice of the eleven mostly second rate illustrations by Cambridge University Press seems unfortunate. It would also have been most helpful to see fascimiles of Kant's handwriting which are fascinating to see. Finally, the Bibliography is one only of &quot;Works Cited&quot;. It could have been more complete.<br />These criticisms aside, the Biography is very well done. It is surely accessible to persons not having a background in Philosophy. I believe that most readers will be pleasantly surprised that the life of Kant was not boring at all, especially in the way it is presented by Manfred Kuehn. I recommend this book very highly.

US	52756915	R2CCUZ82WWWRZM	1558491457	53246902	Melville: A Biography	Books	5	29	30	N	N	Excellent reading about  Melville and his works	This is the best Melville Biography currently available. It is not only well researched and presented, but also and this is very important especially in literary biographies, quite readable and accessible, especially when compared to the ponderous effort by Hershel Parker. The biography is also well-balanced presenting informative chapters from throughout Melville's life. This must have been quite difficult to do, especially for Melville's later years, as there are few primary sources available. The information about Meville's often eccentric and tragic family and family life is also most interesting adding breadth. While other Melville biographers have concentrated too much on the interpretation of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, often offering nothing new, Robertson-Lorant gives the reader relevant information on all of Melvile's work, including his for many readers little known poetry. When interpretations are given, for &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; for example, they are on the mark. Here she makes an intertesting comparison between the three mates (Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask) and the three harpooners (Queequeg, Tashtego, and Daggoo) in which the three &quot;savages&quot; become more &quot;noble&quot; than their white ships' officers. The biography concludes with an interesting analysis of Melville's sexuality. On the down side, there are some errors. For example, on the Civil War the contentions that Lee was surrounded at Gettysburg, or that one third of the participants on both sides were killed, (p.453) are just plain wrong. Luckily other errors are not so common as to detract the reader. In conclusion, I recommend this biography highly. It is accessible to both leisurly readers and persons knowledgable about Melville and his works. It is also reasonably priced.	2001-04-08

Truly excellent Reading	I had been looking for a good book describing what it was really like to sail on fully rigged Ships for a long time, and this may be the best book I have found so far. I have read everything from &quot;Two Years before Mast&quot; to the recently published &quot;Flying Cloud&quot;, but this is really what I was looking for. It seems that most accounts of sailing the large Ships commercially were not written in the Age of the Clipper, but in the Age of the Windjammer, i.e. from the 1890's until the 1940's. The Book is exactly what the title says it is: First hand accounts by professional sailors, officers, passengers, apprentices and others, in the final days of Sail. These have been put together very well into the form of a Journey beginning at a Port in the U.S. or the U.K. and going first to Australia, then South America, and finally rounding Cape Horn for the return journey. The editing has been done by a Veteran Sailor who clearly knows his sources, and has done an excellent job in selecting them. There are also 21 good photographs, a glossary, and a Bibliography of the sources of the narratives and a list for further reading for those who need more.<br />If you like to read about this sort of thing, like I do, It's absolutely gripping reading, not only because of the subject-matter, but because it's all true. The hardships endured by the sailors, through storms, tough work, loneliness, bad pay, terrible food, etc. is incredible to read about, especially when you take into account their tone in which they write about their experiences. They do not whine, lament and complain. Instead, the tone is matter of fact, nostalgic, respectful, and often humorous. You really get a feel for what it was really like, and I suppose that most readers after reading this will be happy to do their sailing from an armchair, in front of the fire, book in hand.	2001-03-19

Here Arjuna again asks Krisna for the teaching he received on the Battlefield in the Bahagavad Gita, but Krisna gives him other teachings instead in a totally different manner, mainly in that of stories of dialogues. Here the teachings are much more esoteric in nature and more difficult to understand. The teachings also contradict the Bhagavad Gita in portions. It is no wonder it has not received more attention for these reasons, but really deserves more, as do the other Philosophical Texts of the Mahabharata.<br />Originally this book was published as Volume 8 of the Sacred Books of the East Series, edited by Max M&uuml;ller, in 1882, and also included a translation of the Bhagavad Gita and the Sanatsujatiya, which are not incuded in the present reprint. The translation is good, and the footnotes are helpful, though it is still difficult to understand. I recommend this book, for those wanting to read another Philosophical Text of the Mahabharata.	2001-03-03

He translated the entire Mokshadharmaparva of the Mahabharata (still the best translation), wrote a history of Philosophy, and published his own system of Metaphysics, and many other works. As a student he was the roommate of Friedrich Nietzsche, of whom he also wrote a Biography. Unfortunately he is largely forgotten now.<br />This book original Title &quot;Sechzig Upanischad's des Veda&quot;, is of questionable value in English as it is a translation (from German to English) by V.M. Bedekar and G.B. Palsule of Paul Deussen's 1897 translation (from Sanskrit to German). I have made spot comparisons of this book to both Deussen's translation and to the Sanskrit Texts, and this just doesn't work out well, because it is twice removed from the Sanskrit text and the translators are not good enough as translators. The commentary is however is most useful. Unfortunately this is the only book in print that contains translations of some of the Yoga Upanishads, Sannyasa Upanishads, Siva Upanishads, Visnu Upanishads and others. It is possible to use this book for reading, but not for scholarly purposes. For just the so-called &quot;Principal&quot; Upanishads seek out Radhakrishnan and Hume  instead.

Excellent examples of architecture, beautiful interior design, and superb photography. Just the right juxtaposition of traditional and modern. Each of the major sections has both Japanese and Western Styles. Normally this would not mix, had it been contrived, but all of the examples in the book are real houses where people live and work. No Architectural Digest type of Houses that look artificial and posed are to be found in this book. My favorites are the tranditional Japanese houses of which there really great examples. This book can give you hundreds of ideas for decorating your house tastefully. The photography really does justice to these houses and the subtle aesthetics of the Japanese Style.<br />I collect &quot;Style Books&quot;, and this has long been one of my favorites.

Intended to give an outline of the leading story and some of the principal episodes of this Encyclopedia of Hinduism; with such explanations as will enable the Poem to be better understood&quot;. They still wrote descriptive, and in this case, accurate titles for books back then, because that is exactly what it is. In a 156 pages Murdoch manages to give an idea of the content of each of the eighteen books of the Mahabharata, mainly following the &quot;Epic Storyline&quot;. He does shy away from the Philosophical portions, but he does manage a good introduction. It may be outdated, but it is for the most part accurate and much better than some of the abridgments, especially that of Buck. Here you at least get a sense of the scope of the Mahabharata. It is worth seeking out. Who knows how much longer it will remain in print. Quite frankly I am amazed it has been reprinted.	2001-02-24

Nautical terms are clearly defined and easy to<br />understand. Several charts explain the Profile, Deck, Spar Plan,<br />Sailing Plan, Points of Sail, and Wind and Water Currents. Diagrams<br />also explain how a full-rigged ship is tacked (turned) and follow the<br />course of the ship during its maiden voyage, which was most<br />interesting around Cape Horn. Several photographs reproduce a painting<br />and engraving of the &quot;Flying Cloud&quot;, its builder Donald<br />McKay, and Captain Creesy. Unfortunately no photo of Mrs. Creesy is<br />reproduced. Still the charts, diagrams and photographs are very<br />helpful.<br />Another good aspect of the book is that Shaw provides quite<br />a lot of information regarding the &quot;Flying Cloud&quot;, which is<br />why I bought the book.... Information is also given on how much water<br />was carried, that it was for drinking and not bathing, and what type<br />of provisioning was loaded. Shaw writes about the nature of the cargo<br />and that the value of the shipping costs equalled &quot;Flying<br />Cloud's&quot; building costs. We are informed about the contents of<br />the Medicine Cabinet, about the livestock taken aboard, about<br />Celestial Navigation, the fact that fresh foods iced lasted for over a<br />month, and much more. Here the book is very strong.<br />The book is<br />really about Captain Creesy's wife, Eleanor, who was the navigator on<br />the journey described, and who worked as a partner with her<br />husband. Shaw tries very hard to show what an intelligent and unusual<br />person she was for her time, or really any time at all, and what an<br />excellent navigator she was. She is portayed as a kind, sensitive,<br />concerned and brave person, popular with both passengers and crew<br />alike, devoted to her husband and the ship. I can imagine that it must<br />have been difficult to recreate her persona, from the doubtless scant<br />sources. Shaw brings this off fairly well.<br />The worst aspect of this<br />book is that it is not the &quot;True Story&quot; of the Flying<br />Cloud. All dialogues, and fortunately there are not too many, are<br />invented, and are times rather tedious. For example, tender moments<br />between Captain Creesy and his wife are not credible, and are also<br />written, as most of the other dialogues, in an unmistakable Twentieth<br />Century Style. This greatly distracts from the Story. Other dialogues,<br />such as that of the Captain and the first Mate, Thomas Austin, are<br />also much too obviously contrived, as are those between the<br />passengers, which are just plain unbelievable. Shaw should not have<br />titled the Book &quot;The True Story&quot;, or he should have not<br />included dialogues. It seems that Mr. Shaw had difficulties with these<br />sections as the style shifts markedly between these and the maritime<br />portions of the book, where he is much more knowledgable and obviously<br />more comfortable. For the reader these shifts are<br />distracting.<br />....Also Shaw would have<br />done well to work with an Editor to correct the many stylistic flaws,<br />especially in the dialogues.

It is an example of some of the &quot;scholarship&quot; currently riding the Bakhtin wave, heavily influenced by personalized interpretations of current trendy concepts and secondary scholarship. Her &quot;alibi&quot; (p.2) taken from Wall and Thomson, is that no study can function &quot;from within Bakhtin's thought&quot;, and this presumably gives her justification to go entirely her own way, which is not bad, but is not supposed to be the intent of the book, and does very little for Bakhtin scholarship.<br />Vice chooses five different Bakhtinian &quot;Concepts&quot;, Heteroglossia, Dialogism, Polyphony, Carnivalesque and Chronotope, and builds a chapter around each, illustrating them in every case with Novels or Films, mostly from the 1990's, chosen by her, none of which occur in Bakhtin's work. An example is the &quot;Chronotope Chapter&quot;, which uses the Film &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot; as the central example. The reader will search in vain in the chapter and index for authors such as Goethe, Stendhal, Flaubert, Sterne, Hippel, Wezel, Jean Paul and others repeatedly mentioned as examples in Bakhtin's Essay: &quot;Forms of Time and Chronotope in the Novel&quot;. This chapter is so far removed from Bakhtin's work, that it is impossible for the reader to get an understanding of his work, which was according to the definition of the Chronotope given by Bakhtin to show: &quot;..the intinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature,&quot; (Bakhtin - p.84). It becomes questionable to what extent Vice understands the concepts discussed, and unlikely that she has read the examples used by Bakhtin.<br />It is difficult to understand how students, the supposed target audience of this book, according to the introduction, are supposed to come away with an understanding and appreciation of Bakhtin's work, when practically none of the many excellent examples he uses are even mentioned. Instead the book relies heavily on secondary Literature and current Bakhtin &quot;Scholarship&quot;.<br />I can only recommend this book to readers who are fammilar with both Bahktin's work and subsequesnt studies.

It is a fairly comprehensive reference guide to Melville's works, their plots, characters, publishing history and critical reception. There are also entries on his family, contemporaries, Current Events of his time, and many different pieces of information a reader might need to know. This book is perfect as a Reader's Guide and the price, especially compared to the other &quot;Melville Encyclopedias&quot;, namely those by Robert L. Gale (1990) and Kathleen E. Kier (1995), which were over $100.00 each, is excellent. The authors are also able to make use of the recent Melville Biographies by Laurie Robertson-Lorant and the first Volume of the Melville Biography by Hershel Parker (both 1996). To what extent the recent discovery of 500 Melville family letters, which are acknowledged by the authors, were used, or if at all, is not made clear.<br />The organization of the book is well done, beginning with a Chronology. The entries, which follow, are probably out of neccessity quite brief, yet for the most part helpful. I would have preferred if their sources would have been cited, as then the Book would have been of use to Scholars. The plots of the Novels are given, sometimes Chapter by Chapter, but there is little interpretation. I have found so far, several minor errors, which are not too serious, and hope will be corrected in subsequent editions. There follow a Melville Family Tree, a Caterogical Index, a useful but not comprehensive Bibliography and finally a General Index.<br />I think on the whole this book is well done in its scope. It is easily accessible and well priced, but is not useful for Scholarly Research, which is, I gather not its intent. Still, the concept is a good one and I can think of at least twenty Authors for who I would like to see a similar Guide.	2001-02-01

Anyone who has used it extensively will realize its enormous value. Even J.A.B van Buitenen took back the harsh criticism made in his introduction of Volume I (p.36-37) of the Critical Edition translation in Volume II-III (p.10-11) after evidently examining the Ganguli (the correct spelling of his name) translation more carefully.<br />First of all, it is still the only complete translation of the Mahabharata. (The one by M.N. Dutt published a few years later, and currently unavailable, seems to copy Ganguli.) Nonetheless, the stilted Victorian English prose may be difficult to get used to at first. For example, words such as &quot;welkin&quot; instead of sky, or &quot;kine&quot; instead of cows, or &quot;celerity&quot; instead of speed are used, and the sentences are sometimes quite convoluted. Once the reader is used to Ganguli's style it is relatively easy to read this translation. I have compared this translation to other partial transaltions, and it holds its own. The Bhagavad Gita is rendered better than some recent translations.<br />It is also a classic because of the superhuman effort made by the Publisher P.C. Roy and the translator K.M. Ganguli to finish this work. Ganguli was, except for short interruptions due to illness, the only translator of the 85,622 verses (3,500+ pages in the present translation), which took twelve years to complete. Considering the gargantuan task, the translation is remarkably even. In some of the philosophical portions, in particular the difficult Mokshadharmaparva, of Book XII the Shantiparva, Ganguli has some problems. If you are seriously interested in the Mokshadharmaparva, seek out Deussen here instead, which is the only other (German) translation.<br />The main drawbacks are, that apart from a rudimentary table of contents, this 12 volume set has no index, and no Critical Apparatus whatsoever, making a daunting task to read in this form. Yet the first edition, has verse numbers and short explanations for each chapter. This makes finding specific verses a difficult task. Why these are not present in subsequent Editions is difficult to understand. Why not just reprint the First edition, which is incidentally better type-set than the present. Without Books such as S&ouml;rensen's &quot;Index to the Names in the Mahabharata&quot;, Jacobi's &quot;Inhaltsangabe&quot;, and others, this edition is quite difficult to use. Another complaint I have, and for other Books published in India is that the binding and the quality of the paper are inferior.

This book will give the reader the basic outline of the Plot, but does not dwelve into the many important Philosophical portions of the Epic, and the &quot;outside stories&quot;. The book is well written. I like the style of R.K. Narayan. As an introduction this book is much better than that of Buck, not only because Narayan is a better writer, but because he had a better knowledge of the Epic, Hinduism and Sanskrit Literature.<br />If you must get an introduction, I recommend the one by C.V.

Everything about is good. The Introduction is well-written, well-organized, researched, and most informative. The annotated Bibliography includes entries for 560 Books, Pamphlets and other Publications. I did find a few minor ommisions, but all the important books on Wayang are listed. The annotations, though brief, are consistently well-written. Five Indices: Personal Names, Wayang Characters, Wayang Plays and Stories, and Kinds of Wayang and a General Index, make this book easy to use. It is extremely well-organized. The only drawback that I can think of is that it only includes sources to about 1986.

What a pleasant surprise then it was to read this book. It is clearly written, concise, with a lot of examples that we, who are not experts in this practice, can relate to. What I really like about the way that Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche writes is that no only does he want to sincerely convey difficult teachings previously not taught to the General Public (see Final Words), but he writes with genuine Compassion.<br />The Book begings with discussions on the Nature of Dreams and their relationship to &quot;Reality&quot; and Karma. He also provides an introduction to breathing, chakras and the nature of dreams before moving on to the actual practice. Here another great feature of the book is the emphasis that the practice can be gradually incorporated into one's life, but that already from the beginning one can benefit greatly. I think that this is very important, because otherwise potential practitioners might be discouraged, because the practice is quite involved and requires great discipline. The book ends with elaborations on the practice as well as kind encouraging words from the author.<br />What a pleasure it is to finally have a book that describes these important practices, which are instructions for understanding our reality, our dreams, ourselves and are preparations for our eventual death. I highly recommend this book, and am looking forward to more books by Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche.	2001-01-16

When I saw this well-priced Book which was originally published in two volumes, at higher cost with a slip cover, I had to have it. I am a collector of Dali Books and was hoping that this Book would be the Catalogue Raisonne of Dali's paintings I had been looking for for so long. In this respect the Book was no disappointment with a total of 1,648 illustrations, but a closer look at the book revealed some serious faults.<br />The worst fault by far is that the printing of the paintings is consistently too dark. Three examples: The blue colors of: &quot;Myself at the age of Ten when I was a Grasshopper Child&quot; (p.202) are much too dark. It is even worse with: &quot;Ghost of Vermeer of Delft which can also be used as a Table&quot; (p.222) Here the figure of Vermeer is in points indistinguishable from the backround and the sky is much too orange, instead of yellowish. The worst example is that of &quot;The Last Supper&quot; (p.488) where the apostles on the extreme left and right of the painting can  barely be distinguished. There are many other examples of this. I made this comparison using several other books and exhibition catalogues, and have also seen the three paintings I mentioned as examples in person more than once.<br />A close examination also reveals that both paper and binding are not of high quality. I have a feeling this book will not stand the test of time. One way to tell a good Art Books when the paper is a higher weight. Judging from the paper, I have a feeling it will yellow in a few years. This is, incidentally, true for other Books that I own published by Taschen. Also, a book this heavy should really have a stronger binding.<br />Annoying also is that there is no alphabetic index of the paintings. Unless you know the year a painting was created, as they are in chronological order, there is no way to find it except by paging around.<br />Despite these complaints, I still like the Book because it includes paintings I have never seen before. If however, you want to see the paintings of Dali as they really look, get &quot;Dali: The Work, the Man&quot; instead. It suffers from none of the faults I have descibed, but is not as comprehensive. It's worth the extra money.

Four texts are given: The original Sanskrit Devanagari Script; a Romanized transliteration which allows the reader to hear the sound of the Sanskrit text; an interlinear word-for-word translation and finally Sargeant's rendering in English prose. A vocabulary is also provided which gives alternate meanings of the Sanskirt words, as well as their grammatical charactersitcs. Thus the reader can get a feeling for the Sanskrit Text, its metrical formation as well as grammatical structure. This is invaluable for Sanskrit Students and also for those seeking to get closer to the original text. I also like the fact that this is a one verse per page transalation, so there is ample room for all the features described. In addition there is a good introduction to the Mahabharata and the place of the Bhagavad Gita in the Epic.<br />Some may argue that Sargeant's prose rendering is not as &quot;poetic&quot; as some other translations. To this I answer that those translations are probably farther removed from the original than Sargaeant's, and he provides the other renderings as well, so the critical reader can check up on him. I have compared this translation to those of M.N. Dutt, Edgerton, K.M. Ganguli, Miller, Zimmer, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, Paramahansa Yogananda, and others, and Sargeant certainly holds his own. It is the apparatus he provides which sets his translation apart.<br />Finally I would like to stress that there is no one &quot;correct&quot; translation and much less interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita. Indeed no interpretation in the form of purports or commentaries is provided here. The universality and flexibility is the beauty of this text that seems to defy translation and specific categorization and interpretation. I am sure that many other translations will follow of this timless text, but in the meantime, Sargeant's translation will prove to be most useful to readers and scholars alike. I recommend it most highly.ul to readers and scholars alike. I recommend it most highly.	2001-01-09
US	52756915	R2BTLHHKH3BTKC	029271534X	840740165	The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays (University of Texas Press Slavic Series)	Books	5	107	107	N	N	Bakhtin's most important and influential work on the novel	This book consists of four essays of Bakhtin's &quot;Middle Period&quot;, two short and two longer works which have been arranged, according to complexity, with the most accessible essay first and the most difficult last. Cooincidentally, this is also the reverse order in which they were written. None of these essays were avaiable in English before the present translation/compilation by Emerson and Holquist, and judging from its many reprintings (the 10th by 1996), quotations and misquotations, and various interpretations, it is the most influential of Bakhtin's works.<br />Some brief notes on the four Essays:<br />1. &quot;Epic and Novel&quot; dated 1941 - A rather straightforward comparison of the Novel and the Epic. Its aim is to show the distinctiveness of the Novel. This can be seen as a transitional essay between the Chronotope Essay and the Bildungsroman Fragment. It is well organized and introduces several characteristics unique to the novel such as three-dimensionality, imagery and openendedness.<br />2. &quot;From the Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse&quot; dated 1940 - This is in essence a brief history of the novel according to Bakhtin. It concentrates on style, theory and as the title states, discourse, beginning with Greek works and going to the Renaissance. Conceptually this is strikingly similar to Erich Auerbach's &quot;Mimesis&quot;. This essay is incomplete.<br />3. &quot;Forms of Time and Chronotope in the Novel&quot; dated 1937-38 - Another long (175 page) discussion on the distinctiveness of the novel. The concept of the Chronotope is introduced simply as &quot;time space&quot; and the essay seeks to show its use from the Greek Romance to the novel of the 19th Century. Bakhtin inserts here also a discussion of the &quot;Rabelaisian Chrontope&quot;, the role of the clown, etc. Special emphasis is also given to the Blidungsroman. This essay, it seems to me, is essentially, Bakhtin's own favorite Reading list in which he experiments with his own concept of Chronotope, skillfully fitting it to each work. Despite its digressions it is basically a chronological presentation.<br />4. &quot;Discourse in the Novel&quot; dated 1934-35 - Another lengthy essay which is in essence Bakhtin's discussion of his philosophy of language. This essay also seems to be unfinished. It consists of five distinct parts in which Bakhtin experiments with different approaches to discourse in the novel. As is often the case with Bakhtin, this essay is also open-ended.<br />I find this compliation of four essays to be most stimulating. It seems to be well translated and edited. Ample footnotes assist the reader with Bakhtin's many, sometimes obscure, literary references. In my opinion, particularly the last two essays, constitute Baktin's most important work on the novel. Those expecting distinct conclusions and theories will be disappointed, because this is not the aim here at all. Bakhtin instead provides many different starting points from which to continue the study of the novel. This is, for example, what makes the chronotope indefinable, because it is constantly changing. I highly recommend this surprisingly accessible book. I believe that it is, along with &quot;Speech Genres and other late Essays&quot; Bakhtin's most important work on the novel.concept of Chronotope, skillfully fitting it to each work.

For those seeking an introduction and interpretation &quot;Creation of Prosaics&quot;, also by Caryl Emerson, together with Gary Saul Morson, is much better. Indeed, Emerson assumes that the reader is familiar with Bakhtin's work. These points aside, she does provide some interesting information about the current (1997) state of Bakhtin Studies in Russia, and Bakhtin's reception in his lifetime. I found this of particular interest. In the second part Emerson tackles a &quot;reworking (of) three problematic areas&quot;. Mainly the subjects of:  1.) Dostoevsky, Polyphony and Dialogism 2.) Carnivalism 3.) &quot;Outsideness&quot; This makes for interesting reading, but nothing really new or groundbreaking is offered. It is merely another look back by a leading Bakhtin Scholar on twenty years or so of Study. The book is undoubtedly well written, and Emerson surely knows her subject, but I can only recommend this to Bakhtin scholars.	2001-01-02

Some titles are excellent, and others are inaccesible, tedious and really not &quot;Companions&quot; at all. This &quot;Companion&quot;, however, to Joseph Conrad is probably one of the best in the series.<br />Beginning with a short biography of Conrad's life, there follow chapters on the short fiction, and several on most of the important of Conrad's works, such as &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, &quot;Lord Jim&quot;, &quot;Nostromo&quot; and &quot;The Secret Agent&quot;. These are followed by sections on his late novels, Conradian narrative, his influence, and others. All of the Chapters are written in closed essay form by leading Conrad scholars, are easy to read, and well documented with footnotes. The final chapter includes a fairly comprehensive bibliography that wil be most helpful for students and scholars alike. It will provide a good starting point for further research.<br />If you are interested in Joseph Conrad, beyond reading his novels and short stories, then this book will be very helpful. I recommend it highly.	2000-12-17

The authors are also very up-front about it, as the sub-title which does not appear on the cover is &quot;A Sourcebook of Japanese Style for the Western Home&quot;.<br />In hundreds of excellent photographs we are shown in sections with such titles as: &quot;Light and Space&quot;, &quot;Traditional Furniture&quot; and &quot;Japanese Textiles&quot; just how easy it is to give rooms and areas of your home a Japanese touch or feel. I personally like the Style very much because it is subdued, almost austere, yet elegant, and makes much use of natural materials. The book is full of really clever examples of what one can do with space, and the best part is, that for the most part it can be done without great expense. The list of sources of where to buy materials at the end of the book is unfortunately out of date. The copy of the book I have was published in 1990, but many sources should be readily available on the Internet.<br />Along with the excellent book &quot;Japanese Style&quot; by Suzanne Slesin, et.al. (at the time of writing out of print), &quot;Japan: The Art of Living&quot; is all you'll need to go Japanese. And lastly before I forget, the price is right.	2000-12-14

Together with the Book: &quot;Fear of Drowning&quot; (see my review), this is all you will need to watch this Film over and over again, and enjoy it more every time. They both serve as wonderful companions. The book contains the exceedingly well written script to this incredibly complex, well thought out, multi-layered Film.  Also included are the scenes that were cut, which I am sure all afficionados will find quite interesting, and a sort of list of the locations of the number count in the film, as well as some great photos.<br />I am not going to review the Film here. Look in the VHS Section for that. I will say that &quot;Drowning by Numbers&quot; is my favorite Film because of its complexity, playfulness, symbolism, its numerous allusions, beautiful cinematography, excellent acting and casting, wonderful music and of course, its Script, which this book is. To the person who enjoys the Film, this will surely make them enjoy it even more. Buy it, and start counting.

It is an abbreviated translation of the 1983 work in German and leaves out key Chapters, for example on Frederick's place in history, and Frederick and his contemporaries. 2.) Worse, it leaves out the Critical Apparatus, both Footnotes and Bibliography, of the German Edition completely, substituting this with a &quot;Further Reading&quot; List. 3.) It does not concentrate enoughm in my opinion, on the Military side of Frederick the Great. If you are expecting, or interested in this, seek out Christopher Duffy's work instead. These reservations aside, the book provides an ample introduction to the remarkable life of Frederick the Great and Prussia. Not much new on Frederick's youth, but the discussion of his Court is of interest, particularly the presumed reason why he produced no heir. Discussion of the Army, the Officer Corps and the Middle Classes are also good. Not much is mentioned about the lot of the Prussian Peasantry, which was of course dismal. Prussia's relations with its neighbors, Austria and Russia are also covered amply. A final Chapter on Frederick as &quot;Philosopher king&quot; will surely be of interest. As a whole, this book is well researched and written, and is a good introduction, though it would have been much more useful in its unabridged form. What is really needed is a new thorough scholarly Biography.	2000-12-05

I own at least a dozen Books, Catalogs and Biographies on Dali, and this is by far the best for the following reasons:<br />1.) Lavishly produced and well bound in Italy by a reputable Publisher of Art Books, Abrams.<br />2.) The text is by Robert Descharnes, an Art Historian, and is translated by Eleanor R. Morse, both of whom had long personal and professional associations, and also friendships with Dali. The brief text avoids &quot;interpretations&quot; of both Man and Art, but concentrates on descriptive information instead.<br />3.) The organization of each chronological section is well thought out. Each begins with brief texts and photographs of Dali, Gala, his friends and contemporaries. Also included are rare photographs of posters, contemporary reviews, articles, sources etc.<br />4.) Included are many excellent works not found elsewhere, and not only paintings, but also sculpture, montages, Jewelry and other &quot;objects&quot;.<br />5.) For its quality and size, this book was, quite surprisingly, reasonably priced.<br />6.) Lastly, and most importantly, the reproductions of the paintings are excellent in color and quality. I can lay several of my Dali books side by side, and look at the same painting, and it will look slightly different in each one. I think the truest colors are in this book. What use is it getting a cheaper Book of Paintings if the colors are off? I think this is something all too often ignored. Always go for the best quality in Art Books.<br />Until a reasonably priced and edited Catalogue Raisonne becomes available, this is the definitive Dali Book to get.	2000-12-04

It is impossible, even for a well read reader to understand Joyce's allusions without this extremely well presented, and well priced, Reference book.<br />Introduction, prefaces and notes explain how to use this book, and how it was compiled. Each episode is preceeded by a map of where the action takes place helping the reader to visualize the movements of Bloom and Stephen. Each entry is preceeded by the  Chapter Number and Line Number according to the Gabler edition of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. In addition, a fairly comprehensive index cross-references all entries. If the reader wants to find all allusions pertaining, for example, to the Book of Luke, these can be easily found. I found this Index quite useful.<br />Personally, I found the following method best for using the book. First, to skim through the allusions, marking those of particular interest, and then laying the book side by side with the Novel and reading the Episode.<br />As for realiability, I took Gifford and Seidman up on their offered Short Title List, and was able to find almost every reference, including &quot;Thom's Official Directory of the United Kingdom and Great Britain and Ireland for the Year 1904&quot;, and have found them to be reliable in their entries.<br />This Book should suffice for reading, and understanding Ulysses, though many a reader may get caught up by Joyce, as I did, so that the following may be useful: Weldon Thornton: &quot;Allusions in Ulysses&quot;, Richard Ellman: &quot;James Joyce&quot;, Harry Blamires: &quot;The New Bloomsday Book&quot;, Stuart Gilbert: &quot;James Joyce's Ulysses&quot;, and of course &quot;The Riverside Shakespeare&quot;, &quot;The Oddyssey&quot;, and the Bible.	2000-12-01

Perhaps it is because I worked in the Dortmund area at one time, and these photos evoke memories of the past...<br />The Bechers offer little commentary. It is not neccessary. The photographs say it all. They speak of an active, busy past and of the transitory nature of humankind's endeavors, once the mines were exhausted or too costly to operate. The photographs are crisp and incredibly detailed. Each Minehead has its own distinct character and beauty. In Germany they used to have names...	2000-11-30

In this excellent book Derek Jarrett describes what it was like to be a Squire, a woman or a Child in this very rough age, by todays' standards. It wasn't like the Williamsburg Themepark at all. Described are how people from different walks earned a living, what they did for pleasure when they had time, and the Violence which seemed to permeate all Classes. Life was tough in the Georgian Age. The illustrations are almost all by William Hogarth who often showed the dark side of English Society of the mid-18th Century. Prints like &quot;Gin Lane&quot;, &quot;Rake's Progress&quot; or the &quot;Cockpit&quot;, show how rough life was, and go very well with the concise well-written text. The sources are all excellent. No doubt, the reader will come away with a new view toward the 18th Century. This book is accessible from everyone from the High School Student to the Scholar, and Jarrett writes in a way that keeps the reader interested. More Historians should write like him.	2000-11-29

Published in 1984, it is now outdated, but it is still worth reading for those interested in Bakhtin and his work. The Biography more or less follows the chronological order of his life, and therefore is helpful in placing his work in a particular time. This is important because the English Translations, especially the Essay compilations, &quot;Dialogic Imagination&quot; and &quot;Speech Genres and other Late Essays&quot;, tend to mix work from diferent periods in his life. Bakhtin's thought changed and developed in his life, and this Biography helps make sense of this. Actual details and anecdotes of Bakhtin's life, that help putting a &quot;man behind the work&quot;, are disappointingly scant. The reader will not learn much about what Bakhtin actually did outside his work in this Literary Biography. Most of all, I would have been interested in his reading likes, as well as dislikes, and his opinions of Authors and Literary Theorists. Otherwise, this Biogrpahy is well written and researched, but now out of date. For Bakhtin studies a new Biography is neded, and even more importantly a Critical Edition of his work.	2000-11-25

This film can be seen over and over again, and new clues, deatails, innuendo, and games can be found. Judging from this book, Greenaway spent years thinking about its creation. In one hundred short chapters, sometimes really only paragraphs or lists, he gives us the viewers, readers, and players, thirsting from more information, almost more than we can handle. Not only are we given the locations of the Number Count in the Film, (but not defenitely, otherwise it would not be a game) but also the Names of the 100 Stars the Skipping girl counts. This will obviously do nothing for those who do not like this film and dismiss it as Overblown, Anglocentric and Self-indulgent. Too bad for you. But if you do enjoy this Film, then you will really enjoy all of the little, and not so little insights, and games. Or are they? If you read this, you will never see the Film again in the same way, and you will probably see it again, several times, perhaps 100 times. After that it does not matter, because all 100's are the same...or are they?	2000-11-24

I disagree with the Thesis: &quot;..that the shadow theater as it is known today is a hybrid of Javanese and Dutch ideas and interests, inseperable from a particular colonial moment.&quot; (Dust Jacket). Just when and where was this moment? This may sound good to Duke University Press, the publishers, and Western Academics ignorant of Java and Wayang, but it's just not that simple.<br />I will touch only on two main points: First of all Wayang is a complex expression of not only Javanese shadow theater, but also Sundanese Wayang Golek (three dimensional rod puppet theater). It is also a combination of History, Philosophy, Religion, Literature, Music, Performance Arts and many other subjects. Many of these are foreign or incompatible with Dutch Culture. Wayang Kulit and Wayang Golek also have to be treated together, not only because of their relation, but also due to the fact that the Dutch influence was greater, longer and more complete in (Sunda) West-Java. Sears not only fails to see this important point, but her knowledge of the history of Wayang and its traditions, both in the present and past are weak.<br />Secondly one needs to know the both the Javanese Version (Both Kawi and the Wayang Stories) and interpreatation of the Mahabharata and its relation to the Sanskirt Epic, and carefully note the differences. Sears does not do this at all. In fact her knowledge of the epics are also weak, otherwise the thesis would be different.<br />Thus, to not thoroughly know both Wayang and the Mahabharata  flaws this book, so I do not even have to touch on its Postmodern / Western posturing.<br />The writing does not flow, and the proofreading and research are also weak. No, the Netherlands were not in World War I, they were neutral (p. 164) and Sanskrit and Javanese Spelling should not be used interchageably (p. 196). There are many more examples of this, so I better stop. This book does not enhance Wayang studies.

There are several reasons for this: The translation is excellent, each Section is also rendered in Sanskrit Transliteration, and the 145 page long introduction is most helpful as are the short Bibliography and Index. The main drawback is that the Sanskirt Devanagari text should have been included along with the transliterated text. This would have made this volume ideal. It was probably omited for reasons of length as this volume is already 951 pages long. --- A word of advice: Do not rely on any single translation. Instead use several side by side. I recommend R.E. Hume: &quot;The Thirteen Prinicipal Upanishads&quot;, and if you read German, even better, Paul Deussen: &quot;Sechzig Upanishad's des Veda&quot;, in my opinion still the best translation of all time.	2000-11-22

As a quick reference this book is very helpful. It contains most of the terms of Indian Philosophy one would need to know, and in many cases it provides a multiple definitions. Sure, some definitions seem simplified, but that is due to their nature, the limitations of the English Language and our own Philosophical Concepts, and to the scope of the book. Dr. Grimes clearly states the aim of the book in the Preface. It is to define &quot;...most terms&quot;, and to do this in a 440 page paperback one needs to be brief. Presumably Scholars of Sanskrit and Indian Philosophy should have other References to consult, but I think it still is helpful also to them, because it is easy and quick to use. Sanskrit Students will also benefit because all terms are given in the Devanagari Script and in Romanized Transliteration. I use this book and recommend it.	2000-11-22

Well organized, informative and full of beautiful photographs. Looking through this book you can learn about the Architecture and Design of Myanmar. The book is divided into sections dealing with Religious and Secular Architecture, Early and Modern Architecture and Arts and Crafts. At the end of the book there is a section of Textiles and Costumes, and another entitled the Pagoda Market which shows photographs and gives descriptions of vendors of various types of handicrafts. Thus a cross section of the different aspects of the Myanmar Style are given, without adaptations by Western Interior Decorators. Some &quot;Style&quot; Books are misleading because they show the adaptations, primarily in the West, of Stylistic Elements. While these books are ok, I prefer to see the Style as it actually is in Myanmar, not a Architectural Digest type of interpretation. This book is free from this. The text is concise and informative. Not overloooked should be the quality of the photographs and the paper and printing, which in this case are all excellent. Some other books of this genre are not up to high quality. No worries here however. I highly recommend this book. It will make you want to visit Myanmar, or at least think about redesigning in your home.	2000-11-21

(See &quot;Bali Style&quot; as an example of this) The Photography is also excellent, and so is the printing.

Also Bakhtin's focus and interpretation changed from his early writing to late in his career, thus creating conflicts. The whole of Bakhtin's work is well analyzed by Morson and Emerson in this coherent and comprehensive study. This is not an easy task. The Key Concepts are interpreted as being: Prosaics, Unfinalizabilty and Dialogue and are discussed in Part One. Part Two deals with the Problems of Authorship. Part Three, is in my opinion the most important, and is the Discussion of Theories of the Novel. Of particular interest here is the discussion of the Chronotope and its relation to the Bildungsroman and sense of becoming. As Bakhtin himself never defined the term &quot;Chronotope&quot;, the authors here explore its relationship to Bakhtin's Bildngsroman fragment, and the concept of Time in the development of the Bildungsroman. They are correct in this assessment, but do not carry the idea far enough. In order to really understand Bakhtin one must read the books he cites from this genre. No study of Bakhtin seems to have done so thus far.<br />This book is useful to both readers fammilar with Bakhtin's work, or to those who want to use it as an introduction. Highly recommended.	2000-10-29

It is really the first Source Book ever: Well organized, concise, with many wonderful photographs and drawings. The only other Books written on Wayang Golek are neither avaiable nor reliable. Of particular interest to me was the list of Wayang Golek Puppets arranged on stage and the arrangement of a Set according to affiliation. The categorization of Puppets may be considered arbitrary by some, but is really well thought out, useful, and a first attempt as such. Buurman categorizes the Puppets into Series primarily according to Facial Types and Head Dress. The Family Trees and the large Glossary contain some errors, but are both usable. I hope that Oxford University Press will decide to reprint this excellent Book.<br />A Short Story about the Book: I first saw this Book in Bogor in the early 90's, where a Puppetmaker showed it to me in Dutch. I immediately procured it in English, and from then on we used the Categoriztion used by Buurman for the ordering of Puppets. In that way I commisioned several hundred Wayang Golek Puppets to be made for me, and there was never a misunderstanding on which type was meant.	2000-10-29

Since it was published in 1970, it is still the only reliable Book which gives the complete Text of three Wayang Kulit (Javanese Shadow Puppet) Lakon (Plays). &quot;The Reincanation of Rama&quot; from the Ramayana and &quot;Irawan's Wedding&quot; and &quot;The Death of Karna&quot; from the Mahabharata. The Book begins with a fine introduction to Wayang, the Plays, Performance and Translation. The translation from Javanese was rendered by Pandam Guritno, one of the froemost Javanese Wayang Scholars of all time, whom I knew personally. Next follow the texts of the three Plays, which include 143 illustrations. James Brandon has also included descriptions of the action that takes place and the musical pieces that are played. The reader can thus review three performances through reading. At the end of the Book are useful Appendices, Notes on Sources, a good Glossary and a now outdated Bibliography. This Book is useful for those who are interested in Wayang, Javanese Culture, Theater Arts, Sanskrit Literature and many other subjects. That is what makes Wayang so wonderful. It is many things in one.	2000-10-27

Nice Photographs, pleasant to flip through, but not meant for reading on a scholarly level. Already the Title is most unfortunate, and is indicative of the lack of respect, knowledge and sensitivity Mr. Irvine has for the subject. He has really only reviewed most of the exisiting Literature on Wayang and has rearranged it in this Book. This makes for a fair, but unreliable introduction. There are no new insights, no new research and no assessments here. It is not too bad when he reviews Wayang, but when he writes on the Subject of Epic Literature, the Ramyana and Mahabharata, which constitue almost all of the Plays of Wayang, then he is totally out of his element. He obviously has little knowledge of the Indian Epics and it shows. I am still pleased the Book was published because it contains many fine illustrations.

All the fammilar names are here, from Holtzmann to Hiltebeitel, with short summaries of their work. Not surprisingly there is not much emphasis on the Philosophical Sections of the Mahabharata, nor are there new insights shared, or conclusions reached. It is more or less a Reference Book, not always reliable, of Epic Scholarship. For the beginning Student this might be helpful as the extensive Bibliography lists most of the important work published.<br />As with other Books in this Series, that of Brill (see my Review on &quot;Essays on the Mahabharata&quot;) and other &quot;similar&quot; publishers, the price is insane.

Someone finally published a Book on the Santiparva, the &quot;Philosophical Book&quot; of the Mahabharata, which together with the Anusasanaparva makes up one third of the Epic. Or have they? The Title is misleading. Walimbe only writes about the first two Books of the Santiparva, the Rajadharmaparva (Duties of a King) and the Apaddharmaparva (Duties of a King in Distress). He does not attempt the Mokshadharmaparva (Emancipation from Transmigration), which constitutes the second half of the Santiparava and is by far the most difficult and most important from a Philosophical Viewpoint. So here we have a Book which attempts to summarize the first half of the Santiparva and does so with mixed results. The emphasis is rightly on the Apaddharmaparva, but the interpretations and conclusions should be taken carefully. There are several reasons for this. I will list two: Dr. Walimbe renders his own English translations imperfectly at times. I think because he uses translations of the Critical Edition (Sanskrit) from several Indian Languages (Hindi, Gujarat, etc.). He also seems to have his own Agenda with this Book which does not mirror in the title. It is not explained exactly what is meant by &quot;Political and Moral Concepts&quot;. --- Still, it is a readable Book and a fair introduction to the first half of the Santiparva which reamins, sadly, inaccessible to English Readers. For this reason I give it four stars.	2000-10-18

Not only are, as the previous reviewer wrote 160,000 terms defined, but there is also a reliable &quot;List of Works and Authors&quot;, which I have found to be quite useful. Preface and Introduction are still quite readable after 100 years. This is truly an amazing feat of scholarship. My copy (Oxford Univ. Press - Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, India, 1993 reprint) has held together remakably well, thanks to careful usage and application of Elmer's Glue to the Binding (Thanks Jerry at South Asia Books). However, the paper is beginning to yellow badly and it is showing signs of becoming brittle. If you will be using this Dictionary frequently, in the long run, there is no savings in buying the Indian Edition. Therefore, my next purchase will definetely be the English Edition. - It's really worth it.	2000-10-15

I can hardly believe that no one has written a review for this book before this, as it really deserves more notice than it has received. Morson, a leading Slavic scholar has also written on Bakhtin, Dostoevsky and other works on Russian Literature. In this book he uses the expertise of his previous work, and also draws on works by writers as divserse as Cervantes, George Eliot and Stephen Jay Gould, as well as Television and Movies, to try illustrate the complex relationships between literature, philsophy and time, with uneven, yet often fascinating results. I have not read anything this original lately, pertaining in particular to Literature and Time. It somewhow reminds me in tone of Bergson's &quot;Time and Free Will&quot;, yet is totally different. There is also, especially in the discussion of the role of the Narrator, a kinship to Umberto Eco, especially: &quot;Six Walks in the fictional Woods&quot;. Yet Morson creates his own concepts of which the most fascinating, each receiving a Chapter of their own, are Foreshadowing, Sideshadowing and Backshadowing. It is not always convincing, but when it works it is very good. It incidentally works best when Morson uses examples from Dostoevesky, Tolstoy and Bakhtin. For example, the foreshadowing in &quot;The Idiot&quot; is quite interesting, as is his discussion of the role of the Narrator in &quot;The Demons&quot;. The Chapter on &quot;Bakhtin's Indeterminism&quot; may be one of the most original Bakhtin interpretations I have read to date. The main thesis of the Book, on the openness of time, comes appropriately form Bakhtin's: &quot;Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics&quot;. - Read the Book.	2000-10-13

Unfortunately, and this is the drawback with some of the English  Language translations and compilations, it is also quite uneven, both in  subject matter and content. The Reader should not be deterred. It is worth  reading, because there are some fine insights buried in this book. --- I  will only write about the so called Bildungroman Fragment here. It has  become almost more legendary because of the fact that Bakhtin supposedly  used the only surviving manuscript for Cigarette Papers and thus literally  smoked his own work. However, any student of the Bildungsroman will  immediately comrpehend its use in Bakhtin's reconstruction of the History  of the Genre. Bakhtin begins with the origins in the 16th and 17th  Centuries, and traces the development to the Classical Period of German  Literature. Presumably, Goethes &quot;Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre&quot; was  to be the pinnacle of development, but this is a part that is lost. What is  important is that Bakhtin not only correctly names the Novels of the Genre  we all should know, by authors such as Wieland, Herder, Keller etc., but he  also names several very important Novels which are usually forgotten, and  have been branded as obscure or eccentric by Critics and Scholars. I will  name three: Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel: &quot;Lebensl&auml;ufe in Aufstehender  Linie&quot;, Johann Karl Wezel: &quot;Lebensgeschichte Tobias Knauts, des  Weisen sonst der Stammler genannt&quot; and Jean Paul: &quot;Titan&quot;. I  would suggest that Bakhtin's Essay is of importance because thanks to him  these three Novels are being rediscovered by todays' readers, they have  entered the Discussion of Literary of Criticism and have taken their place  in the History of the Bildungsroman, which they rightly deserve.	2000-09-13

It is concise, easy to understand, well organized,  clearly written and full of profund insights. The writing is almost  deceptive in that it is simple, yet able to convey complex concepts  clearly. The 21 Meditations are ordered in a logical sequence of  complexity, from &quot;Relying on A Spiritual Guide&quot; to &quot;Superior  Seeing&quot;, and are easy to follow. Even only reading them is very  beneficial to one's well-being. This book is also a very helpful  introduction to Meditation Posture and Environment and also contains the  prayers to accompany the meditations. I must say that it has made a  positive difference for me and to those to whom I gave the Book.

I am sure that anyone who has read &quot;The Man without Qualities&quot; will want to know more about Musil after getting to know  his writing. Sadly, there is no adequate Biography available, even in  German, so one of the best ways to get to know the Author is through his  fascinating Diary. These were actually more Notebooks than Diaries, and  they contain an encylopedic array of information on Musil himself, his  intests, his ideas, and most interestingly his plans for the &quot;Man  without Qualities&quot;. So it is must reading for those interested in  Musil. The English Translation Compilation, has two major flaws. First, it  lacks an Index and other Critical Apparatus, and secondly, we do not which  criteria were used to re-edit the Notebooks, which were originally edited  by Adolf Frise. The German Edition has one Volume of Diaries = 1,000 pages  and one Volume of Notes and Indices = 1,500, pages, making it useful for  scholarly research, to look up subjects, names and places, and most  fascinating Musil's sources.

The translation by J.A.B. van Buitenen comprises approximately the first third of the &quot;Critical Edition&quot; (Poona) of the Mahabharata and  represents the only translation (partial) attempted thus far of this  &quot;Critical Edition&quot;.  The only two completed prose translations  date from the 1880's and 90's by K.M. Ganguli and by M.N. Dutt. The latter  seems to &quot;follow&quot; the first.  Dr. van Buitenen dismisses  Ganguli's transaltion harshly in his introduction, yet his criticism of the  &quot;grating&quot; English which &quot;...does not allow comfortable  reading...&quot; applies to his translation as well.  He takes many  liberties in his &quot;translation&quot; and one gets a distinct impression  of hastiness when reading,  especially when coming across obvious errors.  The judgments which van Buitenen passes on the History of Mahabharata  Scholarship should be read with caution,  for this may I recommend the  recent Brockington: &quot;The Sanskrit Epics&quot;.  The only reason I  would recommend this translation to anyone is,  that it is unfortunately,  all that is available.  I would recommend the interested reader to seek out  the Ganguli translation instead.	1999-03-20
