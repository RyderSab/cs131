Maybe it's because all the hot buttons in today's religious environment are brought right out in front of everyone, and figuring out which one or ones you do or don't want make it too difficult to choose. Goodness knows, there are enough for everyone!  <br /> <br />As in the two previous `Death is Academic' books, set at Princeton University, the area is as much a character as the people. This one is slightly different, however, as the setting is the famed Princeton Theological Seminary, rather than the University.  Prizewinning journalist McLeod Dulaney is back in the north (from her home in Florida) investigating the life of an abolitionist newspaperman who died in 1837. <br /> <br />In the process, she runs into bigger-than-life examples of all the `interesting situations' facing modern churches. Gays in the ministry. Women in the ministry! Inclusive language. Snake handlers. Conservative fundamentalists who believe absolutely 100% in the Bible, with no possible allowance for unknown books or foibles of the various translators throughout history.  <br /> <br />There's also an biblical archeologist who may or may not be dealing in artifacts while working on the Dead Sea Scrolls, endowments that may not be all they're supposed to be, and of course - a dead body. Actually, two of them, but McLeod only stumbles-literally-over the first of them. In a variation on the town-and-gown theme, there are Township and Borough police forces, who usually do not work together willingly, or peaceably.  <br /> <br />The Dean takes exception to McLeod's constant questions and wants her to leave town, but the Township detective has ordered her to stay put. So she moves in with a couple she's known for many years, and resumes her detecting. The characters are all wonderfully well drawn, including all the animals, especially Beelzebub and Gabriel, and the story-line hangs together extremely well, considering all the diverse threads employed in it. In all, I found this to be a very enjoyable and informative book. There are even a couple of recipes included.	2005-09-10

It's entirely too bad that awards are not presented in the book industry such as the ones given for recordings or films or videos. Surely, had the opportunity been presented to nominate the best supporting character in a work of fiction, my choice would have to be that of Charmaine McKinley, who appears in chapter forty of Ghost Music by Alice McVeigh. Of course, Miss McKinley has had more years than most of us will ever see in which to perfect herself, but Ms. McVeigh deserves special kudos for gifting us with this wonderful, wizened little person.<br /><br />It's rather obvious that such as she never existed, therefore she had to be created. And she really must be read about in order to be truly appreciated. She quite steals the book away from the other wonderfully crafted characters in this book, many of whom first appeared in \\"While the Music Lasts\\", the first book by Ms. McVeigh. This book would not make a very good movie, but it would be a perfectly smashing mini-series, there's that much to it.<br /><br />Where to start? Well, after the above-mentioned Miss McKinley, who only appears briefly mid-book, (pages 218-229) there is the delightful dish on orchestral life. If you are, or know of, a classical musician, you'll love the inside scoop, which is more accurate than most folks would believe. It is, after all, the `unsuitable and the unspeakable united in a doomed attempt at the impossible. And they're never, by definition, as good as they used to be.' (quote from page 214)<br /><br />William Mellor, after many years as cellist of the Orchestra of London has gone over to the Royal Sinfonia, one of the many orchestras resident in London. He needs the change of scene in order to balance his suddenly crumbling life. Or try to. It is, of course, impossible. To begin with, after having been informed of his tryst with Isabel (a young violist) by a snoopy neighbor of the violist, his wife Margot has left him, and returned to her mother's home, wheelchair and all. Margot is struggling with multiple sclerosis, and William's default has made continued life with him untenable for her. The shock of Margot's leaving causes William to entirely break off the relationship with Isabel, who after all, has gone over to the new conductor, Karl Hochler, in her temporary loneliness.<br /><br />Without being aware of exactly what he hath wrought, William had innocently purchased a cello from an auction house. Strange things begin to happen-occasionally-to those in the vicinity of the cello whenever it is played, most notably the conductor of the Sinfonia, Leszek Zemitsky. The appearance of a new trial cellist, Janice, seems somehow connected, which makes no sense at all. Unless once can suspend disbelief to include ghosts. For it does seem as the cello is indeed haunted.<br /><br />The presentation of the story line about the cello and how it interacts with each person with whom it shares any space-close-up or across a concert hall-is breath-taking, and eminently believable. The steady decline of the persons most effected by it, whether physical or emotional, is heart-breaking and confusing to those who are not so affected.<br /><br />Eventually, William comes to the conclusion that the cello must die, but that is not so easily accomplished as one might think. With the connivance of Pete Hegel, the orchestra manager, he traces the cello's history, digging out the necessary background information that might help the cause. Or maybe not. In the meantime, however, the two major orchestras of London-the one William did play for, and the one in which he now plays-are having funding crises. A haunted conductor who collapses on stage would appear to be the final blow, except for yet another thread in the overall tapestry. Piotr, the Russian cellist from William's old orchestra suddenly discovers his temporarily misplaced loyalty to reveal a dastardly plot. And then-<br /><br />Really, this book needs to be read, not just reviewed. I've read it threetimes, and still can't get it out of my head.<br /><br />My particular favorite line is on page 55, when describing the cacophony subsequent to the Duke's rendition of Siegfried's horn call in the ornate, fake-marble lobby of a Madrid hotel at 2:45 AM, which set off the fire alarms. \\"The alarm merged with Wagner in a fashion that only Charles Ives devotees could truly have relished.\\" Brilliant.

I was entirely captivated by the first story-A Face in the Window by Evelyn Rogers. Ms. Rogers had the task of setting the scene, providing the background information while at the same time telling her current story. She does this amazingly well. The reader is immediately drawn in to the concept of a mystery weekend at an old, haunted house that is being renovated into a modern bed `n' breakfast inn on the rocky Atlantic Ocean coast of Maine.  <br /> <br />Livvy Hamilton had purchased the old house, which came with its own story: built just after the Civil War by a US Senator for his young bride, the house had been the scene of too many murders through the years. The senator had been found dead in his bed the day after the wedding, stabbed with a unique letter opener. A chambermaid had been charged with the death, but protesting her innocence, she called down a curse on the house. The senator's wife had a miscarriage and then hanged herself in the former chambermaid's room. In more recent times, the house had been abandoned for many years due to these continuing scandals, fueled by ghostly noises, and shunned by the locals. The curse manifested itself by claiming a new victim every twenty years.  <br /> <br />In the first story, Ellie Gresham is not entirely certain she wants to re-engage a romance with a former beau-professor Curtis Davidson, even though he's the reason she's at Lost Angel Inn. Once she meets another of the Inn's guests, Jeff Cunningham, she's even more certain that Curtis is not the man for her. But after she meets all the other guests, as well as the resident staff, she's not sure who to trust and who to avoid. The planned pseudo-murder sets everyone in motion to discover the culprit, but all's not as it seems! This was an exciting story, and could easily have encompassed the entire book with the very believable plot and well-drawn characters. <br /> <br />The second novella, The Edge of Memory by Kathleen O'Brien was similarly well-plotted and well-written, although the tension levels were not as high as in the first story. Emily Carlyle visits the Inn with her aunt Dorrie, who's raised her after the death of Emily's mother, twenty years earlier, at the Lost Angel Inn. Emily was barely eight years old, and hardly remembers her beautiful, vivacious mother. Christopher Maxwell is a part-time employee at the Inn, but it was his father Martin who was suspected of having pushed Melissa Carlyle over the cliff. Although believable, the ending was not a great surprise to me.  <br /> <br />The final section-Shadows of the Pasts-by Debra Webb was by far the weakest part of the book to me. The writing style was vastly different from that of the previous two authors, and I found it hard to get into the story. And while I am seldom able to figure out `whodunnit' even after years and years of reading mystery stories, this one telegraphed itself to me very early on. Using components of the two previous stories, Livvy is harrassed (there's no other word for it) by the local police chief, until the chief's own nephew-and assistant in the very small island police force-Chase Fraley begins to realize that, indeed, all is not as it seems, and sorts through the tangled plot lines. There is a happy ending, more or less.	2005-08-24

And after the first few pages, I thought that might happen. Sadly, I didn't find what I'd hoped to find. If the most dysfunctional family in the country hosts the `house party from hell' one could reasonably expect great amounts of humor. However this book is entirely too serious, with very few chuckles, let alone outright laughs.  <br /> <br />The heroine, Harriet Vernon, needs a bit of gumption-which she does find very near the end of the book, while the hero, Rolleston Manning, Lord Beldon, should learn to open his eyes and his mouth more often. A bit of talking between these two would have solved multiple problems for both of them, as well as other characters in the book, but then it might well have ended up being only half the current size.  <br /> <br />The characters are all well drawn, and the writing quality is excellent throughout. Lusty feelings can be fun, but it doesn't bode well for the future if they get in the way of other communication. The author has a great command of time and place as well as the history of the era. Good for her! No anachronisms. She shows great promise, and I'll happily read other books by her, whenever they appear.	2005-08-24

Truly, I don't know what more one could wish for, unless it be more pages to the story than the prescribed format allows.  <br /> <br />By-elections in the countryside of Regency England-Kent, for example-are not a common base for a Regency novel, and the details presented in this engaging story are fascinating. Kudos to Ms. Bancroft and her library for allowing the rest of us to know them, as well.  <br /> <br />Aurelia Trevor is an only child, nearing her majority when the guardian of her family property dies, leaving her at the mercy of another, rather unsavory uncle. But there is no mercy forthcoming, merely the prospect of a forced marriage to Auuelia's cousin. Drastic measures are needed to maintain her hold on the family estate Pevensey Park, so with the connivance of her long-time governess and now friend, the two women head for London to search out a husband.  <br /> <br />The chosen candidate is Thomas Lanning, an unmarried financier, but otherwise not someone Aurelia would have been likely to encounter in her life. The two engage in a `Taming of the Shrew' sort of married life, effectively stopping the efforts of her uncle and cousin to gain the property and the heiress for their own purposes.  <br /> <br />Thomas has an agenda of his own which is a major factor in his decision to marry Aurelia. He wants to enter politics, and sees the seat at Lower Peven as the ideal place to start. Along the way, he is forced to face up to his own family responsibilities, adding a half-brother and sister to the mix at the Park, along with a new steward and other retainers. Sparks fly as old and new customs are blended together to match this new blended family. <br /> <br />In the end, everything works out splendidly, and the journey to get there is a most enjoyable one. It's fun to watch Aurelia and Thomas battle their way to a new understanding of each other and themselves in the process. Any reader who loves to read and savor words will greatly enjoy this book.	2005-08-14

I particularly enjoyed the young man Harrison Black who is the main character. He's not exactly bumbling, but not always overly swift, either. However, once he gets his feet on the ground in his new surroundings, he does begin to better process and understand the events swirling around him. <br /> <br />An orphan, Harrison was mostly raised by his Great-Aunt Belle Black, who had purchased (with the help of the local bank) an old building on the bank of a river in North Carolina.  She called it River's Edge, and peopled it with a variety of small shops and offices. In addition to her candle-making shop At Wick's End, she made an apartment for herself on the second floor. When she is found dead in the shop, Harrison inherits everything.  <br /> <br />Although he has little of his own, he's not exactly sure that he wants to pick up and move to River's Edge. However, Aunt Belle has stipulated he must live there and try to make it work for five years, or else he loses everything. Harrison has bounced from job to job, has no particular love interest at the moment, so why not? And away he goes.  <br /> <br />As he meets the various tenants, he begins to wonder about Belle's death. Was it the accident it looked like, or could it have been something else. After several strange things happen to him, Harrison becomes rather paranoid about his close neighbors. He patiently builds up a case against each of them, only to have it all dissolve into nothing. Finally, however, he guesses right and just happens to have a handy (and most unusual) weapon available at the right time.  <br /> <br />The characters are all engaging, and will certainly prompt the reader into wanting to know more about them. The plot was more than sufficient to keep me turning the pages, and although I did occasionally get a twinge of `it was -`, turns out it wasn't, after all. I'm looking forward to the next venture at River's Edge.  <br />	2005-08-13
US	50289674	RZTIBPL61F2EI	0425201503	155338924	Mr. Impossible	Books	5	8	10	N	N	No romance ??!!	It's usually interesting to read what other readers have to say about a book one is reading, or has read. Unfair to check before reading, I think.  <br /> <br />After laughing myself silly, rapidly turning pages in this wonderful book, I am dumbstruck that anyone would say `there's not enough romance in this book.' Can they have read the same book I did? Apparently so, although I find it hard to comprehend.  <br /> <br />I found there to be delightful romance on every page. Not each page contained romance between the hero and heroine-there may have been 30 or so that didn't-but there are different sorts of romance to be considered. Having not so long ago experienced an astonishing bout of lust, I believe Ms. Chase deserves every accolade there is for her marvelous depictions of silly, rambunctious, delicious-and yes, loving lust. Blatant, subtle, funny, joyous, all-encompassing-I wouldn't have missed it for the world, and can only feel sympathy for those who never have.  <br /> <br />Passion comes in many guises, and a passion for scholarship or learning or exploring when coupled with a passion for another person can be devastating, even when it ends happily, as does this book. Although, to be sure, the first paragraph of the Epilogue gave me a jolt. I should have known enough to trust the author more than I did.  <br /> <br />Mr. Impossible should certainly be a major candidate for best book of 2005.	2005-08-12

Somehow I missed number three (which lack I will immediately address) so I was pleased and delighted to find this one - the fourth in the series. Unfortunately, I don't think it matched the very high quality established by the author in the first two books. The writing, however, is still crisp and clear, as always. <br /> <br />I did like the shift of location-it's always fun when a series can move away from its home base, even just for one book. It's obvious that Ms. Donnelly knows Idaho as well as she does the Seattle area, and she excels at putting the reader into the geography. Also, meeting friends from a few years back adds to Carnegie Kinkaid's persona, helping us to understand how and why she became what she is today. The history of the area adds greatly to the story. It is almost casually sprinkled in here and there, and is never boring. <br /> <br />It's fun to learn about new businesses-who'd have thought that wedding planners needed to know so much about apparently everything? Thank goodness, Carnegie does, and is easily able to step into the breach when the previously-engaged planner goes temporarily AWOL from the very celebrity wedding of one of Carnegie's friends. Although she'd been invited to the wedding, Carnegie really hadn't planned to attend, until a distress call from another friend prompted her to go back home to Idaho for the event.  <br /> <br />Summers in the west are rife with forest fires, and Ms. Donnelly has obviously studied the situation with great care, as her descriptions of the smoke jumpers and fire fighting ring very true. It's a tension-filled life, to be sure, and this book is a terrific tribute to those brave folks who embrace it with gusto.  <br /> <br />Although I did enjoy this book, I kept getting the notion that it was almost two stories that had to be compressed into one, leaving out an awful lot of the author's ordinary attentionto detail. We do get to see more of Carnegie's Mom-and kudos to the author for making this older woman attractive, smart and sexy! Some of the other regulars Boris and Aaron (Carnegie's on-again/off-again lover) are already known to us, but still we get more little tid-bits of their past. There are so many new folks in this book, however, about whom we might like to know more, and they get short shrift.  <br /> <br />The ending is appalling. I felt so cheated, which is the major reason why I could only give the book 3-well, maybe 3 -- stars. Of course, once I've read book three, I might better understand why the author did this. Or maybe not. One thing is for sure-it won't keep me from reading more of this author!	2005-08-02

Ten or so years ago, in an attempt to expand the readership for Regency novels, the two major publishers of these books-Signet and Zebra-added elements of fantasy, time-travel or sensuality. Not all of the books contained all of these elements, but apparently a majority of the readers didn't want any of them, so it was back to the traditional again. This was greatly aided by the appearance of Colin Firth in the A&E/BBC production of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". A good trade, if you ask me. Except . . . <br /> <br />Some authors can handle all of these added ingredients with zest and gusto, creating a world previously not thought of by us more ordinary mortals. Such an author is Sandra Heath. MAGIC AT MIDNIGHT is a time-travel that moves from contemporary New York to Regency Gloucester in the blink of an eye-and back again! There are definite fantasy rudiments, as well. As to the sensuality? Well. It would be advisable to wear flame-proof gloves while holding this book to read it. Or at least one such glove on one hand while the other holds a fan, vigorously wielded. Mercy!  <br /> <br />This is NOT a weak-kneeed, lily-livered Regency novel; not meant for the more timorous reader, either. And, for once, a cover quote is completely accurate. No less an expert than Mary Balogh offers this opinion: \\"Brilliant time travel . . . sizzling sensuality.\\" <br /> <br />Kathryn Vansomeren had it all: a handsome architect husband, a job with a TV station, and a gorgeous apartment in New York City-and a baby on the way. Then, the job went sour, she lost the baby, her husband's work became over-demanding, and the final straw-their long-anticipated vacation in England had to be postponed. Or did it? Just because Philip couldn't go didn't necessarily mean that Kathryn had to stay home. So she didn't.  <br /> <br />Lady Marchwood-Rosalind-was `given' in marriage to a man she could not like, let alone love, leaving her vulnerable to the more gentle charms of a neighbor, Thomas Denham. Sir Dane Marchwood will not be a complacent husband, conveniently looking the other way. In fact, when he sees the two in what he thinks an amorous embrace, he challenges Thomas to a duel.  <br /> <br />Kathryn and Rosalind alternate identities, before agreeing on the only sensible solution, one that will-in time-benefit each of them. History cannot, of course, be changed.  <br />  <br />The descriptions of Regency Gloucester blend into the modern setting with a smoothness that has to be read to be appreciated, but then, this is the author's home city. She knows it well, and utilizes the surrounding area as an added character in the book. Marchwood Castle may not exist-may never have existed-but it is indeed very real on these pages. This is another on the long list of masterful novels by this gifted author. Be warned, however, there is more than sweet kisses between the lovers. Keep that fan handy!	2005-07-11

These were the acknowledged masters of the \\"Golden Age of Mystery Novels\\"-Agatha Christie, Ellery Queen, Ngaio Marsh, Rex Stout, Dorothy Sayers, Erle Stanley Gardner, Mary Roberts Rinehart, etc. They kept me busy-and reading-for a good many years. In fact, I still go back to them, with great anticipation, and am seldom ever disappointed. Even the occasional anachronisms are fun!  <br /> <br />How then, could I pass up \\"I dreamed I married Perry Mason\\"?  I couldn't, it's that simple. I rather like the trend of using real (older) characters in new books, as long as it's done in a sensible fashion. Here, the author really does a great job of telling us more about the man, Erle Stanley, and his various series of books. I loved the Donald Lam/Bertha Cool books as much as those about Perry Mason and Della Street. I knew nothing about the earlier books, which makes me want to go find them.  <br /> <br />CeCe Caruso is a delightful, mature lady-not an oldster, by any means, but not a young chick, either. Thank goodness! She's bright, and insecure, and persistent-admirable qualities, all. Her love of vintage clothing is an added fillip. One wonders which of today's fashionistas will be so celebrated in 40 years as the great names of the previous century.  <br /> <br />CeCe has a career, too, as a biographer whose books are actually published. Good for her! When she gets stuck mid-way through her 6th book-about Erle Stanley-she stumbles over an intriguing letter to the Court of Last Resort, an offshoot of Gardner's early career as an attorney. The clues to the mystery involved are scattered throughout, but not blatantly displayed, leaving the reader to wonder a bit. The research involved is awesome in its complexity, and presented in a very accessible manner.  <br /> <br />The secondary characters-and the plots in which they are involved-are an exotic bunch, but after all, they do live in La-La land! The writing is terrific: engaging and extremely descriptive with ample humor, as well. CeCe isn't afraid to occasionally deride herself or her foibles, but never gets maudlin about it. Bring on Nancy Drew, I say! And after that-who knows?	2005-07-04

Other than a few unfortunate typos, I found this to be a very nearly perfect book. It is gorgeously written, with believable characters, an abundance of plot and such realistic descriptions of Yorkshire and Edinburgh that one could almost imagine being there to see the action unfold. <br /> <br />Unhappily, I suspect this book will not receive anything like the success it deserves (based on the above) because it doesn't exactly fall into the necessary guidelines of `what makes a love story a romance novel'. Indeed, it is more like the dashing historical novels of years past.  <br /> <br />Who among us hasn't made the mistake of falling in love at the wrong time or with the wrong person? Rosamund Lovelace is but ten-and-six, visiting her aunt in Edinburgh when she first meets Rory Buchanan, then a lieutenant. She throws her soul as well as her heart into this new emotion, and fearing they'll be soon separated, unwisely writes him a passionate letter. Of course, it falls into the wrong hands, and she is mortified by the outcome.  <br /> <br />She returns to her family in Yorkshire and he goes off to Portugal. Two years later, they discover each other again, when the now-Captain Buchanan ends up at a neighboring estate that has just been inherited by his commanding officer. During the next six years, they will meet and part, and meet and part, with each of them moving forward and backward as if in a dance.  <br /> <br />Of course, there are many other inhabitants of this story: Rosamund's cousin Hero, her two uncles, Anthony and Leonard (Hero's father); Hero's maybe love, Lt. Wemyss, and the other military folk-Captain Macdonald, Colonel Fitzgerald and the villainous Captain Buchan.  <br /> <br />It does all end well, finally, or at least mostly so. Not, however, before the vicious malcontent Buchan has masterminded a plot that upsets nearly everyone involved and ends in a murder. The last fifty or so pages are positively hair-raising! <br /> <br />A rattling good read, indeed! If, that is, one reads what is there, not what one thinks should be there.	2005-05-28

Logical, because that's where he lives and teaches and writes. Having read-and enjoyed-several in the series about Sheriff Dan Rhodes, I had no hesitation whatever when I encountered this book, the second in this series.  <br /> <br />Professor Sally Good is a good-ol boy-er, gal, er, lady in Texas who is the chair of the English Department at a community college just outside Houston. Art imitating life, perhaps?  Well, Sally is a lady of a certain age (unspecified, but not exactly a spring chicken) a widow, with a house and a cat, and a libido that would like to be more engaged than it is. Two of the men in her department are of interest to her, which causes her some dismay.  <br /> <br />Jack Neville is a nice, charming man who is an excellent teacher. Sally recognizes that latter factor even as she realizes that he doesn't have much effect on her pulse rate. Jorge Rodriguez, on the other hand, is a hunk, but hardly the sort of man she should be thinking of in quite that way. Jorge has done time in the `big house', has tattoos and a lot of raw sex appeal.  <br /> <br />When a knife that Jack made in a continuing education class is found in the back of one of the college trustees, the local law enforcement officer is convinced that Jack is the one who put it there. Sally knows better, and the two of them set out to prove that she's right. In addition to another murder, there are a good many detours along the way, and some positively wonderful characterizations of academics and car dealers and other inhabitants of the town. Not to mention that Jack and Sally each have a mother and a cat, who are also given great personalities.  <br /> <br />Crider's prose zips right along at maximum speed, and before you quite realize it, the case is solved, and the only remaining mystery is - who will be Sally's next date? I'll hope to find out soon.	2005-05-23

For some reason, books set in Venice have loomed large on my reading list lately, this being the third in the last month. It wasn't necessarily Venice that drew me to this book, however, it was the music, and I was not disappointed at all. For me, this book worked on every level; the writing is superb, the musical detail fascinating and accurate, the plot and characters believable and the tourist's guide to Venice (not written as that, exactly) inviting. I didn't know until I was into the book that the protagonist is lesbian, but so what? Cassandra Reilly is witty and literate, so who really cares what she does behind closed doors?<br /><br />Cassandra is a translator of foreign-language novels into English, and while engaged in this activity, does a good deal of traveling here and there. Sometimes the travel is for work, sometimes for pleasure, sometimes to help out a friend. This is how she ends up in Venice. Her erstwhile landlady in London, Nicola Gibbons, is a noted baroque bassoonist who has gone to Venice for a conference about the all-girl orphanages and orchestras of the post-Renaissance period in which Antonio Vivaldi lived and wrote some 600 + concertos for various instruments, including bassoon.<br /><br />A valuable antique bassoon has been stolen from the palazzo where Nicky is staying, and she is the prime suspect. She claims she was sleeping at the time of the theft, and sends an appeal to Cassandra to come to Venice and help find the real thief.<br /><br />After several false starts, the mystery is solved and the thief apprehended, but in the meantime, the book is full of unexpected delights. The peek into the world of book translation was especially interesting, as was the excursion into the world of baroque music, much of which is only now being discovered. This was the third of three books about Cassandra Reilly; I look forward to reading the others now that I've found her.	2005-05-23

While it is certainly thus set in the Regency, it isn't really a romance, as such, but more historical fiction. If you like the books of Catherine Cookson, you should really like this one by fellow Brit, Sandra Heath.  <br /> <br />Innocent Nonny Lambert, suddenly orphaned at fourteen, now at nineteen, finds herself also destitute with no family, no funds, little hope for the future. The only thing she does have is a solid family tradition of the theater: her Italian mother was a noted opera singer, her older sister Melisande an acclaimed opera dancer and her father THE dancing master, and supreme choreographer. Nonny was meant for the stage as well, until her lessons ended so abruptly five years ago.  <br /> <br />Now, however, her future is dark, when she is befriended by an unlikely young woman-Josie Woods-an impertinent young `employee' of Madame Siffre. Madame runs an exclusive gambling establishment with attractive young women who are available to the clientele, for a price. When Josie discovers Nonna's singing talent, she convinces the younger girl to come with her for an audition. Perhaps Madame would provide entertainment of a different kind to her clients.  <br /> <br />With the help of a mask and a turban to cover her flaming red hair, Nonna is a success beyond her dreams. Although she meets many titled gentlemen, two in particular will play a large role in her future. Justin, Lord Farnsworth, heir to the Duke of Aldane is obsessed by the young woman who seems impervious to his title, his wealth, his attractive person. Justin's cousin, Sir Philip Hastings, older and more temperate, is the one who catches Nonna's eye. Other than to rescue her from over-amorous young men, however, he pays Nonna little attention.  <br /> <br />One day, Nonna goes to the Opera House, where she meets her sister's former lover, Armand Vania, the premier dancer in all of England. He immediately casts aside all his flirts to zero in on Nonna. Knowing she cannot have Sir Philip, she accepts Vania's proposal.  <br /> <br />On the surface, they are London's golden couple; talented, beautiful, wealthy. But off-stage, little is as it seems, and when Vania believes gossip rather than Nonna, her world falls apart once again.  <br /> <br />Vania becomes a formidable enemy, but fate works in strange ways. Nonna persists in her determination to tread the straight and narrow pathway on the way to her own stage career while fending off importunate town beaus. Josie proves to be a good friend, and finds her own beau, a young playwright who crafts Nonna's stage triumphs. With the help of a rival theater manager, that is.   <br /> <br />In the end, well- there is a happy ending, of course. But this is not a typical romance novel, to be sure. It does have all the hallmarks, however, of a Sandra Heath novel. Wonderful evocative writing that creates a `you are there' sensibility; one can almost smell and taste the London she imagines. The settings are vividly brought to life with few words, and the characters are as well-drawn and varied as any thought up by Shakespeare. She kept me wondering until the next-to-last page. Well done!	2005-02-24

He's right, of course. To be sure there were lots of scams before then, but this book could be considered a catalog of the `scam-of-the-week'. Perhaps tycoon types would find it fun reading all these behind-the-scene descriptions of get-rich-quick schemes, but after a while, truly, it gets to be a bit heavy going.  <br /> <br />Still, Mr. Payne is one heck of a story-teller, and his considerable writing skills lure you ever-onward toward the final reckoning. Younger readers may have a hard time believing some of this, but us older fogies will know he's absolutely nailed the era and the various mind-sets that existed then.  <br /> <br />Steve Draves, mid-30s, an entrepreneurial type, is married to the gorgeous Betty, and has almost one-year old twin sons. His business-he buys and sells things, usually real estate-seems to be doing okay, if not spectacularly. What more could he want?  Well, to begin with, he wants Tina and Sandy and Deby. And two million dollars in his private account.  <br /> <br />He is scrupulous when it comes to staying legal, most of the time. The one time things get flubbed proves to be his nemesis. The client is a mobster with a daughter, and she is determined to have Steve for herself, regardless of the maneuvering she must do to make this happen.  <br /> <br />I wouldn't give away the ending even if I could, because I don't want to be a spoiler. The book is not easily classifiable, to be sure; it's a suspenseful thriller with a touch of mystery. Kudos also to Mr. Payne for being able to tell such a compulsive, male-oriented story without resorting to street language.  <br />   <br />Here's my recommendation to any reader-try SIX HOURS PAST THURSDAY-I'm sure you'll enjoy it. And then, like me, you'll be waiting, rather impatiently, for the author's next book.	2005-02-22

To paraphrase (just slightly) from her newest book, DIAMOND DREAMS, it is: `come with me to this ancient Celtic land of legends, myths and magic, where it is easy to believe in the fantastic and supernatural.' Of course, she is Welsh, which explains a good deal, I think.  <br /> <br />In the first few pages we meet a horse-charmer (who also has `perceptive' gifts) and a tea-thrower. Well, and why not? These are but two of the marvelous supporting characters to be found in her newest tale which takes us from London to Wales to St. Petersburg, Russia. Every detail fits perfectly, and if you can't believe, then you either have a heart of stone or no heart at all. True, there are some little bits of coincidence, but then, all of life has them, as well. They're still believable as she intertwines them in her tale.  <br /> <br />When Athan, Lord Griffin, glimpses Ellie Rutherford in a country inn's garden, she is wearing a maid's clothing. Her own garments are being cleaned after having someone else's meal spilled all over her. This episode of mistaken identity heralds several such incidents throughout the book, not all of which will end happily. He knows only that hers is the face of an unknown woman in a portrait he's purchased, and with whom he's fallen in love. He has, in fact, identified the portrait as being of Caroline, his wife, who just may be a figment of his imagination. <br /> <br />Lord Griffin is betrothed to one Fleur Tudor, the supposed daughter of a good friend, now deceased. Once Athan sees Ellie, however, he wishes for nothing more than to find a way to marry her, instead. Although she suspects him of being involved with the financial ruin of her father (which led to his suicide) she cannot help being attracted to the Welsh lord.  <br /> <br />They part, Ellie to live with her uncle John in Wales, Athan to visit St. Petersburg, on a diplomatic mission. Even though separated by thousands of miles, they share a fantastical episode which convinces them of their love for each other, if not how to make it all work out as it should.  <br /> <br />The detail in this book is splendid. The characters are fascinating, and the story itself is unusual yet somehow entirely believable. DIAMOND DREAMS is Sandra Heath at her very, very best, and definitely belongs on every reader's `must have' list.	2005-02-21

However, if you like fast-pacing, and lots of sexual tension you might not like it as much as I did. (This is in no way a quibble, merely an alert.)<br /><br />Lavinia Stewart is orphaned at an early age, and when her caretaker uncle suddenly dies, she's sent from Jamaica to England to live with an older brother. He'd really rather not be bothered with her, or his own two motherless children, much preferring the lifestyle of a randy bachelor. Fortunately, he doesn't often come to the estate where Lavinia and the children live. He also doesn't pay much attention to the costs of maintaining said estate. At twenty-six, Lavinia has given up thoughts of marriage, while fighting off the friends of her brother.<br /><br />When Captain Chartwell of the Royal Navy moves into the adjoining estate, his young charge immediately forms a bond with Lavinia's nephew, resulting in additional tumult. Two young boys are much more of a handful than just one!<br /><br />The captain runs his home like his ship, discipline and all-at least on the outside. Over a period of weeks, the two loners-Lavinia and the Captain-become ever more drawn to each other. It's almost as though a hedgehog was being courted by a porcupine-very tentative, very cautious, and also amusing and endearing.<br /><br />The Captain's background (somewhat touched on in the author's `His Last Lover') leaves him entirely unprepared for finding love, much less recognizing it when he does find it. The author has done her research very well; the shipboard scenes are very real. There will be more books in this non-series series, and I'm quite sure we'll meet up with the Captain and his mermaid again. Not to mention his brother and sister. I'm looking forward to them.	2005-02-04

There's never a dull moment in this very plausible story of a young woman who discovers, just when she's about to enter the world at the age of eighteen, that she isn't really who she'd always thought she was! Oh, to be sure, Janine Oldfield is the daughter of London's most famous actress, Peg Oldfield, but-not as Janine had always thought-from the wrong side of the blanket. Oh, no!  She's the legitimate daughter of Peg and her short-lived marriage to Henry Winterton, and as such, the heiress to the wealthy Calworth estates. (Think Castle Howard in the TV production of Brideshead Revisited.) <br /> <br />Because of a promise made to her mother when Peg was dying, Janine shortly thereafter finds herself in the rugged Yorkshire countryside, Calworth, to be exact. Here, she discovers the other side of herself, and begins to wonder about her future. She'd always planned to follow in her mother's footsteps on London's stages, but now her mother's insistence on a trial as heiress will turn her life upside-down. <br /> <br />Of course, there are also two men. One who loves her, but whose love she can't return, whereas the one she shouldn't love is - well, you'll enjoy the reading of it, anyway. Ms. Heath's stock characters are all here: the well-meaning grandparent, the scheming viscious she-cat (human variety) and loyal friends of all kinds from all levels of society. Scenery and costume descriptions will make you drool with delight! Another oldie but goodie that deserves to be re-issued, from this always-entertaining author.	2005-01-24

They might even learn something!<br /><br />When presented in such an interesting manner as in this book, one realizes the human side of history. History, is, after all, about people-real people-not just generals and admirals or kings and emperors. It is the real people who do the fighting, and the loving, and perform the brave acts that enable those others to take all the glory for themselves. It is also a study of power, politics and alliances.<br /><br />How many of today's students in the United States know the reality of the French and Indian Wars? Who fought in them, and where and why? It has long been said that those who do not remember history are doomed to repeat it.<br /><br />Although Richard Patton, the author of the Neophyte Warrior series is an educated man, he is not a historian by trade. Perhaps this is why his interest in the young George Washington is so easily-and vividly-brought to life.<br /><br />In 1753, the twenty-one year-old Adjutant General of Virginia and Major in the Virginia militia, is sent to Pennsylvania to investigate the encroachment of the French troops, coming down from Canada. There are also the various Indian tribes in the area of the western part of the state from Lake Erie down to Maryland, from what would be Erie in the north to Cumberland in the south. The rough land is mostly virgin timber, fast-moving rivers and mountains. The weather is as difficult as the surroudings.<br /><br />All of the characters are fully-fleshed out, whether former slaves or Indians, aristocrats or settlers, British or French or American, men, women or children. Meticulous attention has been paid to the customs, living conditions, costume, and social attitudes of each segment of this new world. It's fascinating to read about, but I'm not so sure I'd have liked living then. For certain, however, I know a lot more about this small segment of history now than I did when I began reading this book.<br /><br />It's easy to read-the pages just zip past, but every now and then, the reader has to stop and go back for a further examination of a particularly lovely phrase or sentence.

Not only the first chapter, but as close to page one as possible. If the story couldn't be made to fit that requirement -- too bad. No sale. And we'd have missed this marvelous book, in which the first murder doesn't happen until page 116! <br /> <br />Thank goodness that's no longer the case. A PLAY OF ISAAC by Margaret Frazer is not a fast-paced, whiz-bang type of story. It is layers deep, with full-bodied characterizations and lavishly described surroundings so that on nearly every page, one can see and hear and smell and taste- and almost feel the world in which the book is set. It's a lovely, languid reading experience that will stay with you for a good while after you've finished it.  <br /> <br />In 1453, the world was fairly well run by the church. Most folks couldn't read, but could remember saint's days and church festivals-with a little help from the monks and priests who lived and worked in the churches and abbeys. Some of the bigger festivals, such as Corpus Christi, meant a holiday from work, so was an even bigger event. Adding to the teachings of the church, groups of players delivered morality plays, and it was not uncommon for several of these to be given in a day's time, by various minstrel troups in scattered locations throughout a larger city such as Oxford.  <br /> <br />It is there we meet Joliffe and the others of his band of players: Thomas Basset, the playmaster; his maybe-widowed-maybe-not daughter Rose, and her son Piers, plus Ellis who has aspirations other than acting. He'd be Rose's second husband in a minute, if she'd agree. Rose cannot be a player, of course, but she's the costumer, scenery deviser, props master, chaperone, and general manager, nonetheless. Even Piers plays many parts.  <br /> <br />While settling in for the festivities, the troup is `discovered' by an Eden-child, Lewis, who may indeed be simple, but he uses the wits he has to better advantage than the so-called normal folks around him. He is a wealthy young man who is fostered by the wealthy, merchant Penteney family, and is even betrothed to their daughter, Kathryn. In fact, the banns will most likely be posted during the festival, in the presence of Lord and Lady Lovell, who will be visiting her parents.  <br /> <br />In this tense time, with a weak king on the throne (Henry VI) the ever-constant threat of Lollardy is a grave offense. Along with the Lovells comes the first murder, and skeptical Joliffe mistrusts nearly everyone, although the acting crowner Barentyne seems reasonable and fair. Between them, they'll get to the bottom of the various mysteries, which may prove unsatisfactory to some readers, but are all perfectly sensible to the era in which the crimes take place. <br /> <br />If you're at all interested in theater, you'll relish the remarkable research done by the author, and attention to details paid to the still-somehat-young art of that time. It's amazing how sophisticated players and playing could be all those centuries ago.  <br /> <br />If you need a fast-paced, shoot-'em-up type of story to keep you happy, this isn't that sort of book. If you like history, theater, words and characters about whom you'd like to know much, much more, then this is YOUR book. And soon, with luck, there'll be more to come in this new series by the author of the Dame Frevisse Medieval Mystery series.	2005-01-07

But then, life intervened: David had to make a sudden trip to India, with no time to advise Adele that he still loved her and would return. The letter went astray, and the betrothal was broken.  <br /> <br />As if that wasn't enough of a blow, four years later, her father died in disgrace, leaving her nearly destitute and forced to find employment A friend who was a haberdasher was pleased to employ Adele, but her new life style bore little resemblance to the one she had expected to be leading.  <br /> <br />Set in Bath, the story is light-hearted yet serious, a reminder to all of us that life can change in the blink of an eye. In spite of hardships, wonderful villains and other traumatic events, all comes right in the end.  <br /> <br />A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE <br /> <br />An unexpected inheritance can open-or close-doors. When Caroline Lexham found herself to be the new owner of an elegant London mansion, she knew it would take a major effort to maintain both herself and her new abode. So, she turned it into a first-class (five-star?) hotel. Her chance to shine in Society's light is a celebratory banquet honoring the Duke of Wellington in the spring of 1818.  <br /> <br />It's hardly to be wondered at that a cousin takes exception to this plan, as do several rivals, but Caroline will not easily give up her dream. When Harry Seymour appears on the scene, she knows she's made the right choice.  <br /> <br />There is a lot of action in this story, and just enough romance to keep things interesting. How neat to have these two books in one volume. Adele and Caroline would have been great friends, had they ever met. Each of them is true to her own self, while forging ahead in ways new to the times in which they lived, yet never exceeding the boundaries established by society. And in the end, their dreams come true.  <br /> <br />As usual in any book by Sandra Heath, the settings, the costumes, the characters, the events depicted are all true to the Regency era. This one provides double the pleasure. Hooray!	2004-12-05

Some of the stories are more magical than others, to be sure. Amanda McCabe's \\"Upon a Midnight Clear\\" was delightful in its presentation of a heroine other than petite, blond and barely out of the schoolroom. Hurrah for that! Antoinette Duvall's presence in England and this book are a welcome addition to the genre, as well as being a perfect match for Captain Mark Payne, invalided out of His Majesty's Navy. Other than a slightly commercial, rather modern sensibility regarding buying gifts for everyone imaginable, this is a charming story.     Based on past experiences, I wasn't overly hopeful of `The Ultimate Magic' by Alison Lane. When the first paragraph contained a young lady `snarling' and slamming a door, followed by the next paragraph with a different young lady cursing, I decided to follow my initial inclination and proceed to the next in line, Edith Layton's \\"The Two Dancing Daughters\\".     This one is magical, but how could it not be with Ms. Layton in command. It's whimsical, yet grounded in the tale of two sisters, `Rose Red' and `Rose White' who don't seem to leave their home of an evening, yet wear out pair after pair of dancing shoes. A recuperating army Major is hired to find the solution, which of course he does, and he also gets one of the sisters for his own, as a reward. Delightful in its whimsy, it's just not as Christmas-y as some of her previous stories.     On the other hand, \\"The Enchanted Earl\\" is about as magical and Christmas-y as it's possible to be! Barbara Metzger always delights with her sometimes slightly cock-eyed take on various situations, and this tale is no exception. Laurel Mumphrey is a youngish widow, just out of mourning for her late, unlamented spouse. To celebrate her inheritance as well as Christmas, she plans a celebration at her home, and recalling magicians from her childhood, she sets out to engage one for her party. Little does she realizethe hazards involved in trying to find one real magician. Spinrod the Sorcerer could hardly be the fulfillment of her dreams; he was elderly and not very magical. Or maybe she was wrong?     Magical and romantic describe \\"The Green Gauze Gown\\" by Sandra Heath. Two years after the death of her husband, Rosalind Harwood's older son-nine-year-old Peter-had become the sixth Marquess of Southdown, necessitating their return from America to Puckscroft Park, near Brighton. Her other son, six-year-old Jake, has seemingly formed an alliance with an invisible man, Mr. Dobbs, who does all sorts of wondrous things. Rosalind's first love, Sir Henry Trafford, still lives almost next door to the Park, with his sister and mother. His well-intentioned gift threatens to produce a major scandal until Jake and Mr. Dobbs intervene, clearing the way for the Rosalind and Henry to re-affirm their love.     Volume Sixteen is a splendid addition to Signet's tradition. Have some eggnog, light the candles, and enjoy the sounds and smells of the holiday season as you read this book.

Styles change, even in writing, and it can be educational as well as entertaining to take that step backwards.  <br /> <br />Certainly Ms. White knows how to plot. That is, by far, the strongest element in this book. It's somewhat strange to read a book with so little dialogue and so much introspection. And, so many viewpoints.  Nearly every character in the book has a chance for internal conversation with his or herself.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, in a mystery novel, there must be at least one sympathetic character for the reader to root for, and in this book, the most sympathetic of all is the dog, Sock. A sort of Old English Sheepdog, Sock waits patiently for the return of the daughter of the house, Winifred Froy, who delights in being away from home for months on end. Not just from home, but from country as well, and in the middle to Eastern Europe of the thirties, this can sometimes be a dangerous pastime.  <br /> <br />Winifred is the `lady' of the title, but the main female protagonist is Iris Carr, a youngish Englishwoman about to return home after a holiday in an un-named country, perhaps in the Balkans, but filled with mountains and resorts. Her friends have all left a day or two before she does, leaving her to the company of a rector and his wife, a honeymooning couple, and a pair of elderly spinster sisters. <br /> <br />They all end up on the same train, heading for Trieste, and further embarkation. Iris is injured, thus putting her in the company of Winifred, and a strange assortment of natives, none of whom can speak any other language. When Winifred vanishes mid-trip, Iris is suddenly informed that not only has the lady not vanished, she never even existed at all! Thus the nightmare begins.  <br /> <br />The suspense is somewhat weakened by the repetitiousness of Iris's meanderings--physically and emotionally. Finally, in spite of the well-meaning interfering young Hare, his friend the professor, and the villainous doctor, all ends as it should. I think it might be fun to find a video of the movie just to compare notes.	2004-12-03

Well, sometimes. But it's always a good thing to remember that the victor only got there because of the common folk who helped him or her achieve the victory. Sometimes, in war, these folks are rather crassly referred to as `cannon fodder' when they might more properly be called `stepping stones'.<br /><br />On the other hand, real life is lived by real people, and a fact sometimes overlooked is that these real people are the ones of history, just as much as are those victors.<br /><br />Although I wasn't around then, I'm quite sure that Richard Patton's books give a more realistic view of the battles fought to establish America as an independent country than do all the history text books that have ever been written. History teachers could do themselves and their students a good turn by assigning his Washington series as supplemental reading. I daresay the students would learn more, as well.

I'd say that 90% of this book is the story of one day of that battle. It's a heart-rending loss.<br /><br />In addition to Washington, there are several British and French officers plus a few of the Indians with whom we become rather well-acquainted. Some of them are surely in the previous books, and will continue to the next, as well. Old Smoke, for one, I hope.<br /><br />Which is not to say that only students or teachers should read or enjoy these books. Not at all! Anyone, of almost any age and sensibility, will find them accessible, informative and (gasp!) entertaining! These books will make it much easier to understand the French and Indian Wars, which were, of course, not between the French and the Indians. Rather, THEY were allies against the British and the colonists. Eventually, even though they lost this battle, Britain did win the war, although it took more than ten years. They were then precipitated into another war-the one for American Independence.<br /><br />There may be those who think the book is not politically correct. And they'd be wrong. Facts are facts, and revisionist history does no one any good. Better to know the truth of such matters, from which we can learn how to improve ourselves, if we pay attention. On that topic, the Massacre happened because the British were determined to fight like the civilized folks they thought they were. But they weren't in their usual territory, either. They were also too bull-headed to learn from the circumstances in which they found themselves.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book tremendously, and am now off to find the prior books in the series: #1 - His Majesty's Envoy; #2 - The Reluctant Commander and #3 - The Lion's Apprentice.

US	50289674	R33CHIIJ7ORFGW	1554100607	780522860	Thin Ice	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Ice Hockey  & Romance -  why not?	There aren't too many romance novels set around the world of ice hockey. Too bad. The sport provides an abundance of action, characters of all kinds-good and otherwise-of all ages, and settings that can vary from local to international. THIN ICE encompasses all of these.  <br /> <br />Mattie Kincaid is an athletic young woman who wants to combine her love for sports with writing, and gets a dream assignment-covering the Seattle NHL team for an on-line magazine. Of course, the first player she meets-the one sent to pick her up at the airport-is the team's superstar, Grant Alexander. From the beginning, sparks fly between these two, in a mostly believable way.  <br /> <br />There is one major problem with this assignment, however, and that is Mattie's total lack of knowledge about the sport of hockey. It doesn't take long for Grant to discover this, and while he teases her a lot for this lack, he decides to at least teach her the basics.  <br /> <br />What Mattie doesn't tell him right away is about the sort of boy-friend she left back home in Colorado Springs. Bryce is a know-it-all, totally convinced that only he knows what is best for her. He also `knows' she isn't good enough to fulfil her dream, and tells her so at every opportunity. Mattie almost, but not quite, believes him.  <br /> <br />It doesn't take long for Mattie to discover that the team is hiding a secret: the trainer, a young woman named Jamie, whose twin, Jeff, is also a player, had been kidnapped the previous year. When her fiance (the team's goalie, A. J. Charbonneau) traces her to the mountain hideway, he is also captured. Only after the villain falls down a flight of stairs, breaking his neck, are Jamie and A.J. able to secure their freedom. The team has embraced the young couple, and while certain details have been made public, the entire story is kept within the family.  <br /> <br />As well as learning about hockey, Mattie displays her skill at softball, providing the winning home run in the annual intra-team game. She travels with the team, and the relationship with Grant builds, while she begins to see Bryce for what he really is.  <br /> <br />Websports, Mattie's employer, then decides now is the time for her to provide the gritty details about the tragic scandal of the previous year. Unfortunately, the letter is seen by others, including Grant, who promptly shuts Mattie out of his life.  <br /> <br />Bryce, of course, knew she'd fail, but suddenly discovering the back-bone that Grant had reinforced, and she didn't know she had, Mattie breaks with Bryce. She flounders a bit before being offered a job with the Seattle team.  <br /> <br />It takes a while, but finally, at the urging of Jamie, Mattie and Grant overcome their differences and reconcile in a most improbable place. You'll have to read the book for all the details. I don't think you'll regret doing so.   <br /> <br />Note: While I did give this book 5 stars, truly, I think it's a 4  star book. Since my only other option was 4, I chose not to go that low. The reason is some very crude words here and there which jarred me from the story, temporarily. They served no good purpose, seldom being of any benefit to the story. The writing otherwise is very good; the plot, the characters, the settings all held my interest to the point that I found it very difficult to put the book down before I had finished reading it. I would happily recommend the book to readers of any age, any gender, whether hockey fanatics or not.	2004-10-18

In case you've ever discovered yourself doing something entirely unplanned or even un-thought-of, you might want to check your family portraits. Especially if the time is close to Halloween. You may well have a Lady Margaret of your very own, conjuring up ways to get you to do as she wishes, rather than what you might have had planned.  <br /> <br />Sandra Heath presents a perfectly plausible explanation for such activities in her delightful romp \\"The Halloween Husband.\\" Since its publication in 1994, when it promptly became my favorite of her books, I've tried to re-read it every year just prior to the date it commemorates. It never loses its charm! <br /> <br />When Rowena Melcombe found herself in an all-too-lifelike dream with a gentleman she didn't even know, she had no idea that the next day, there he'd be, virtually on her doorstep. Well, actually, it was in the secluded vestry of the church where Rowena had gone for a private cry. And just like magic--in walked the very gentleman of whom she'd dreamed so lasciviously the night before.  <br /> <br />The Melcombe family troubles began when the husband and father, William, died suddenly, leaving behind a widow, a daughter, Rowena, his heir, the studious fifteen-year-old Lionel, and twin sons, Stephen and Paul. At twelve years of age, they're fit to become devils all on their own with their endless pranks. If only there was enough money available to allow them to live as they ought, but no -- that was beyond possibility.  <br /> <br />Still, however, there is Lady Margaret. She is determined to keep her little family safe and in their own home. Never underestimate the power of a truly obstinate female, especially a ghostly one!  <br /> <br />Lord Justin Alderney is a rake of no little regard, frustrated at his father's command to marry soon. If necessary, the Marquis will choose a suitable bride for his son. Well! This sort of situation cannot be left on its own to develop when there's a willing, if ghostly hand available to help out just a little bit!  <br /> <br />Set in the countryside of Exmoor as well as London, legends and lore of Halloween abound in this tale that is certain to bring laughs, chuckles and an abundance of smiles to the reader. Add in the perfect happy ending for each character, including Lady Margaret!-and happy sighs will also be heard. No tricks-it's the perfect treat!	2004-10-16

Sheriff Dan Rhodes is a `good `ol boy', boy in this case meaning absolutely no disrespect, but just that he's easy-going, laid back, relaxed...well, you get the point. In addition, he's very addictive.  I suspect one would do well to read these books in the order written, the better to keep track of the regulars-both human and dogs-that are part of the town of Clearview, county of Blacklin, state of Texas.         <br /> <br />This book not only tells us how he acquired the Edsel and `Yancey' the dog mentioned in later stories, but also shows off the thinking skills of Dan and his somewhat recent wife, Ivy.  It's clear that Dan is no longer as young as he once was-but then, few of us are. His acrobatic stunts are fewer these day, which is a good thing. And while you won't have any shoot-em-up wild and wooly car chases, there is exactly enough excitement to keep you reading until you reach the final page. <br /> <br />One accidental death in a fairly small town might be accepted as just that; a second sets folks to wondering, but the third! Well, that starts Dan and his staff-deputy Ruth, dispatcher/computer whiz Hack and jailor Lawton-to wondering about various things. The first death had been a hit-and-run, the second a drowning, and the third was what Hack insisted was `spontaneous combustion'.  <br /> <br />While all this is going on, Clearview has another problem to solve, which promises to be just as combustible. The two historical societies are feuding over the rights to an ancient cabin, as well as where it's located. The Clearview Sons and Daughters of Texas and the Clearview Historical Society most usually disagree about nearly everything, so of course they have differing opinions about the proper place for the cabin, as well as the planned celebration in the coming year.  <br /> <br />Rhodes tries to stay on the diet Ivy suggests, but it sure isn't easy. The minutiae of small-town life may be small stuff, but, bit by bit Bill Crider creates a wonderful slice of small-town life to accompany his puzzle. Clearview is a wonderful place to visit. You should try it sometime.	2004-09-09

If you're expecting another `music box mystery' from Larry Karp, you'll not find it here, although there certainly is an abundance of mystery, and a music box, just for good measure. This is a stand alone book, not part of his well-received series featuring Dr. Thomas Purdue.  <br /> <br />Actually, this book is an almost total departure from the prior books of Karp, in that most of the action takes place in New Jersey, in the early years of W W II. It's rough and rugged, and entirely compelling. You might find the story hard to get into, but once there, putting it down is even more difficult.  <br /> <br />Every family has a mystery somewhere, and not all of them see the light of day. It was only a fluke, really, that let Martin Firestone discover his family's mystery, and thanks to his persistence, we can share, and learn from it, as he did. Martin is twenty-eight, and a computer wizard. Suddenly, without warning, and no really good reason why, he decides to change his direction and become a doctor. Telling his father-the 76-year-old Leo, a world-famous artist- of this decision opens the past to both of them.  <br /> <br />For Leo's father was a doctor. Samuel Firestone was far more than just a doctor, however. He was a brilliant diagnostician, an insightful healer, a man who both believed in and mistrusted his God, and who cared for people, regardless of age, race, color or ability to pay. His mission was to make folks feel better, and he did this in any way possible, even if not always entirely legal.  <br /> <br />The rough, tough world of war-time scrapyards in Hobart, New Jersey, alternates with more civilized sections, but always the dirty, low-down side of the business is prominent. The young Leo spends his days in happy innocence until a music box found in the attic becomes the catalyst that will eventurally bring everything out into the open, exposing  too many secrets better left hidden. In one devastating week, Leo's world comes tumbling down around him. <br /> <br />Now, fifty years later, Martin unintentionally opens the door to Leo's past, and using his own modern skills to offset Leo's artistic skills and Samuel's intuitive ones, all the old skeletons are finally laid to rest.  <br /> <br />The nitty-gritty world of the young Leo is hard to inhabit, even for a short time, but the language and the violence is never gratuitous. This is an astonishing story of a supposedly kinder and gentler era, which it really wasn't at all. You won't soon forget Leo--and Harmony, the young girl who wanted only to be his companion, not his shadow--nor Leo's parents, Samuel and Ramona, the one patient beyond Sam's ability to cure. I'm glad I read it; I think most people would be.	2004-08-31

Or any other meal. A quick glance in the dictionary will tell anyone that the word was not used for this purpose until 1899. A bit more digging in culinary lore will explain when and how the pastry was created and given that name.     Further -- the word `deem' is NOT a synonym for `deign'. Ever.     Finally -- the concept of a gently-raised young British woman (less than 20 years old) of high aristocratic birth being used as a `secret agent' during the Napoleonic Wars is so preposterous as to defy all sensibilities.     If the author couldn't figure out these things, where on earth was her editor?    There are a lot of characters, none of whom prompted me to care enough about them to continue reading, and their method of communicating with each other was yell, yell and yell some more! The plot was the same old, same old belligerent older brothers who know everything, and will choose a husband for their sister, as she, of course, has no brain and no sense.       I usually refrain from writing negative reviews, but this one is just simply a bummer that I could not finish.	2004-08-21

Not Ann Waldron, that's for sure! This first of a series is entirely entrancing, especially to one who is in any way involved with a university.  <br /> <br />McLeod Dulaney has surprised herself and her paper -- the Tallahassee `Star of Florida' -- by winning a Pulitzer Prize. She's even further surprised to be invited to Princeton University to lead a course on \\"Literature of Fact\\" to a small, select group of students. And off she goes, with the blessing of her editor.  <br /> <br />Once settled in, McLeod discovers her students to be excellent writers, and they're curious about nearly everything, an important ingredient if one wants to be a reporter. They form a tight band, protective of each other, and McLeod.  <br /> <br />Quickly assimilated into faculty life, among mostly witty, charming, literate folks, the first tragedy occurs shortly after a party, when a professor falls ill, and despite excellent and prompt medical care, dies within a short time. And if that's not enough, within a month, another succumbs to the same illness. McLeod's students think it might be murder, and after two could-be accidents, or maybe not, McLeod begins to feel the same way. And when she recalls an article she read in a medical magazine, she's sure of it!  <br /> <br />There are red herrings here and there, but solid clues as well. The ending came as a surprise, but followed a logical path. I hope McLeod has a good many more such adventures.	2004-08-16

Truly, however, the personality types involved could easily be found in any tightly-knit group of folks who spend inordinate amounts of time together in an enclosed space, or who frequently travel together. It could perhaps be about an athletic team, although, of course, there are few of them which are co-ed. (But then, of course, neither is the Vienna Philharmonic!)<br /><br />There are 105 musicians in a standard large orchestra, and the same types play over and over and over again, regardless of location. Anyone who has ever studied music and played in an orchestra (or even a large concert band) will readily recognize each of these characters, although they will be known by different names.<br /><br />Ms. McVeigh is not only a symphonic caliber cellist, but also a gifted writer possessed of absolutely wicked insight, not to mention humor, perception, sensibility and grace. She uses her musical skills to great advantage, as well, while juggling the lives and tales of her principal players, conductors and the other persons who occasionally wander through the story.<br /><br />The main theme belongs to Isabel and William, who cannot be together, but neither can they be apart, a situation altogether too common in every day life. Their tale, and all the others, are variously told in flashback, as narrative or diary entries, blended together into twelve-part harmony, with only slight dissonances here and there.<br /><br />What lover hasn't thought as Isabel does when she says about William, for instance: `If love was a foreign country, let him be my interpreter...' This is a marvelous book about people; witty, perceptive and well-written--vastly enjoyable on many levels. One doesn't have to be a musician to appreciate its depths.	2004-08-12

Layer upon layer upon layer: characterization, plot, setting. Some books one reads (or attempts to, at least) seem always to be missing one or more of these rather important elements. When you add in writing (and/or sometimes editing) skills-or the lack of them-finding a great book to read can be a task filled with mytery. Not so with the books of Sandra Heath, and in particular, her latest, Winter Dreams. <br />The story begins in Lisbon, Portugal during the Napoleonic wars, then travels to London and then to Cornwall. In addition to French spies and English espionage, there is a prima donna who could give Maria Callas lessons in the art of being one; brother/sister twins with a psychic connection; a ghost; an old love gone awry but come to life again-and a hero to die for. <br />This book has everything. Everything! It has mystery and atmosphere and adventure and a romance that transcends years and distances to reunite Judith Nicholls Callard with her first love, Daniel, Lord Penventon. Although marriage between the two had been long planned, the younger Judith had fallen for the practiced charm of another man, Robert Callard, only to be widowed when he fought a duel not quite a year before the opening of the story. She'd had no plans whatever to meet up with Daniel again, but had accompanied her twin, Jamie, on his government assignment to Lisbon.<br />Daniel is known to have been consorting with the celebrated opera star, Madame Bella Barnardi, who has also caught the eye of Napoleon, along with those of seemingly every other man on the face of the earth! She is as volatile as dynamite, whether on- or off-stage, and what she wants, she will have. Currently, she wants Daniel, and lures him to her side (with the help of the British government) by offering secret information of a very personal nature about and from Bonaparte. <br />Bella blackmails the British government, which then blackmails Daniel into cooperating with the singer, entirely against his wishes. Finally, he is able to convince the new Foreign Secretary to assist in a plot to trick the diva into divulging her secrets, rendering her threats useless, and freeing Daniel to pursue his love, Judith. Except for one small detail. <br />Fearful of Bella's vengeful nature and several previous attempts on her life (both in Lisbon, onboard ship sailing back to England, and then again in London) Judith has taken herself off to Cornwall, and Daniel is unable to find her for several weeks.  <br />The resolution is fast and furious-and eminently satisfactory-as Bella gets her comeuppance, leaving Daniel and Judith to live happily ever after in mysterious Cornwall. This is a book to be read and re-read, over and over again. Purely marvelous!	2004-07-06

A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS is one of the better examples of this trend, mixing a strong mystery plot along with a good bit of village life into the plot. I'd not read anything by this author previously, but will willingly read her other books. <br />One forgets sometimes about the deadly effects of village gossip on the inhabitants of such a small geographical area, in the days before radio, television or telephone. Many a reputation was totally ruined by word-of-mouth, whether made-up or factual stories. <br />If I had to find a quibble here, it might be that Penelope comes across as just too good and nice and sweet. Too nearly perfect. Of course, the cover is another problem, but that one isn't the author's fault! <br />Neither of those comments should discourage any reader, however. This really is an excellent, well-written, interesting and enjoyable tale of everyday life in a small village and the surrounding areas, where an unlikeable man meets an untimely death, and what happens next to his family and his neighbors, in an attempt to find out who was responsible.	2004-04-29

Whispering campaigns can be devastating to anyone, much less a politician. Sound familiar? Well, the technique is hardly new-Shakespeare utilized the tactic in Othello nearly four hundred years ago. <br />When Julian Norcliff, Earl of Lockwood, became the target of nasty innuendoes regarding his sexual preferences, his secretary Malcolm (himself rumored to be one of those preferences!) devises a scheme to shut up the whisperers. The Earl could hardly take a wife-he already had one, although she was in Italy and he was in England. Their marriage of convenience barely lasted through the ceremony before circumstances separated them. Since then, Julian had kept himself busy with his estates and Parliament. Now though, he'd have to try another tactic. <br />Laura Lancaster was a struggling young actress who found herself stranded in England, the war of 1812 keeping her away from her home country of America. She'd been visiting her mother in Paris, but fled to avoid a rather forceful would-be suitor. She was determined to support herself, rather than doing as the rest of the actresses did, becoming the mistress of a wealthy, usually titled gentleman. Her friend Celia Carteret was blissfully happy with her Lord Belgrave, but Laura just couldn't think that solution right for her. <br />Until a slightly different solution was created by Malcolm, one that would benefit both parties. Lockwood's money would furnish a small house and provide suitable clothing for Laura, who would appear with him in public, pretending to be his mistress. Privately, however, they would be merely acquaintances, not lovers. It was to be hoped gossip about them would kill the rumors. <br />This short plot summary barely begins to cover the entire story, but whatever a reader wants from a book will most likely be found here in this truly delightful concoction. There is romance, to be sure, along with history, and a mystery involving charges of treason, murder and other unpleasantness. The author travels skillfully from Seven Dials to Mayfair to Shadowhurst (the Earl's country estate) with descriptions that will make you feel you're there, as well. Although categorized as 'historical romance' which it certainly is, the book has a decided Regency flavor to it as well, unusual in such longer works. <br />I'd not read anything by this author before, but I do hope she continues writing about the Regency period. Actually, I liked this book so much I read it a second time! Might there be a story about Julian's younger brother, Randal? One can but hope. One can also hope that when the year's best books are listed in various places for various reasons, UNTIL YOU'RE MINE will be at the top of those lists. It certainly deserves to be there!	2004-03-14

Most of them have been re-issues of very popular stories from the past, sometimes of two different authors, sometimes two stories by the same author. This new edition, however, with two stories by Sandra Heath, takes the previous concept one betterone old 'beloved' story (indeed!) and one new one. What a perfectly splendid idea.<br />A successful Regency novel may have many ingredients. Among the plot elements are: love at first sight, love unrequited, marriage of convenience, mistaken identity, wealthy marrying not-so-wealthy (either sex in each category) and titled personage marrying a commoner. Necessary characters are a handsome hero, a winsome heroine, a charming pair of secondary characters, of the same sterling quality as the main pair, and at least one villain or villainness of superlatively menacing manner. A pet or two certainly adds to the mix. Finally, the writing must be better than good, preferably careful to the times depicted, free of anachronisms, and hopefully with an abundance of wit.<br />It's hardly a secret that I find these quantities to be present in the works of many of today's authors, but most especially prevalent in the works of Sandra Heath. Her newest title, FINE FEATHERS, is no exception, and neither is the older bookTHE MAKESHIFT MARRIAGEthat Signet has paired with it as their current two-fer. (I love this concept: I hope it continues forever!)<br />The two Miss Marriots in the first storycousins Margaret (known as Molly) and Delphineprovide nothing but trouble for the twelfth Earl of Bardolph, Rupert Drysden, and believe me, no one is more deserving of such a fate. Eventually, after a near-kidnapping, an unsuccessful switch of look-alike racehorses, and a severe caseor twoof mistaken identity, all ends well. The Earl is vanquished and indeed banished from England by the cleverness of the hero Hal Cordrey, a widower and wealthy landowner, as well as magistrate for the area. The wealthy marquess ends up with Margaret, while Delphine secures the love of her life, Neville Botting, curate of Coln Cordray.<br />Set in Gloucestershire, in and around the then famous Bibury Club Races at Seven Downs, the lush June setting comes alive by the wondrous descriptive passages by the author.<br />THE MAKESHIFT MARRIAGE, on the other hand, is much more complex (as well as nearly twice as long) and demonstrates in very subtle fashion, the consistency of the author in writing style, research and character development. First published twenty years ago, The Makeshift Marriage has remained atop the favorites list of many devoted Regency readers, which is no mystery whatever. Whether reading it again, or for the first time, the story is satisfying in every possible way.<br />When Miss Laura Milbanke splurges her entire small inheritance for a dream trip to Venice, she has no idea that her life will take a drastic turn-about. She'd seen a picture of the famous Hotel Contarini, and had dreamt of little else since then. Anticipating a lifetime of boring service, she believes the trip will provide dreams enough for a lifetime. In short order, she meets two gentlemen: the Englishman Sir Nicholas Grenville, and the Austrian Baron Frederick von Marienfeld. After Laura spurns his advances, the Baron challenges Nicholas to a duel. In spite of her protests, Nicholas proceeds, and is later  brought back to the hotel, nearing death.<br />Even though he is certain to die, Nicholas asks Laura to marry him, and somewhat reluctantly, she agrees. However, Laura is a faithful and caring nurse, and so they return to England and his Somerset estate, King's Cliff.<br />While Laura had traveled to Venice to live out a dream, Nicholas traveled to get away from his home, and ponder the necessity of killing a dream. For centuries, King's Cliff has been an opulent host to royalty and other aristocrats; ruinously so. Now, if the estate is to continue at all, severe changes must be made, and unable to think clearly at home, he'd come to Venice to think.<br />With the care of Daniel Tregarron, the local physician-as well as an old friend-Nicholas slowly gains back his health, only to discover even more dangerin his own household. More in love with the house than its new owner, his former fianceé, Augustine Townsend, has no patience with illness or anything that comes between her and her dreams. She flitters between Nicholas and his heir, who is also his cousin, James, the earl of Landford, who has his own dreams.<br />If you like terrific plotting, excellent writing, and perceptive character development, all combined with descriptions that take you to the very scene, you'll certainly enjoy THE MAKESHIFT MARRIAGE. It's a classic for all time.	2004-02-21

And then, one must also consider the great comedian, Jack Benny, who, having arrived at the age of 39, liked it so much, he stayed there for the next 39+ years, bless his heart. <br />James Anderson has once again adroitly combined mystery with comedy in his newest British country houseparty mystery novel, &quot;The Affair of the 39 Cufflinks&quot;. Even after such a long hiatus from the first two books in the series-some twenty years or so-this one never misses a beat, picking up where the others left off-at Alderley, of course. <br />Alderley is a 17th Century Westshire stately home in the days when a stately home was still the family home; in this case the Earl and Countess of Burford (George and Lavinia) and their rather flapperish and head-strong daughter, Gerry. <br />Having suffered from 'unfortunate incidents' during two previous houseparties, the Earl is understandably hesitant to host any more such gatherings, but the death of an elderly cousin-by-marriage-the Honourable Mrs. Florrie Saunders-forces his hand. She is to be buried at Alderley, and as all the principal mourners are mentioned in her will, there is almost no way for them not to be invited to the house for a brief time afterwards. <br />Of course, plans are always made to go astray, and so they do. Clara, daughter-in-law of the deceased takes exception to the will, and declares her intention to reveal the secrets she knows about those present. She has, after all, been making a tidy living for herself using such tactics for some time now. Before she can do so, however, she is found in her bed. Murdered. Scattered around the floor of her room are-39 cufflinks. Why are they there? What do they mean? And why 39? <br />Fortunately for the Earl (and for the readers) Detective Chief Inspector Wilkins is assigned to the case, and carefully, painstakingly, he and his minions set out to resolve the riddle of the cufflinks. In the best tradition of the country house murder, each guest is thought to be the guilty one, only to be declared 'improbable' or 'incapable' or 'otherwise occupied' at the time in question, in spite of the finally-revealed 'secrets'. <br />Among the guests (a wonderfully eccentric stereotypical gathering) are Agatha and Dorothy, the step-daughters of the murdered Clara, and granddaughters of Florrie, plus four great nephews, one great niece and two great-great nieces. Among them are an MP, a King's Counsel and his empty-headed but beautiful blonde daughter, a Jeevesian type young man about town, reduced to selling motorcars to earn a living, a fashion editor from New York, come home to London to make her way, and of course-the Burfords, complete with butler, Merryweather. <br />Gracefully written, this intricately plotted homage to the two great doyennes of British mystery-Christie and Sayers-will tickle your funny-bone while engaging your little grey cells in this entertaining romp. We can but hope that the author will not make us wait so many years for our next visit to the wonderful Alderley.	2003-12-13

How many young persons have the attitude of &quot;It won't/can't happen to me?&quot; Nevertheless, human bodies are frail and subject to breakage, sometimes with only a minimum of force being exerted on them. And mothers continue to suffer because of this inherent frailty. The death of a child-a child at any age-is without question the highest hurdle ever presented to a parent.<br />One such parent is Jane Melbourne, whose son Jim was always a daredevil-type young man, until at the age of 29, he took up sky-diving. Unfortunately, his very first jump was Jim's last such adventure. His mother, in her grief, while searching for answers, found very few that made sense to her, and so she dug deeper, ever deeper. What she discovered is the basis for this book, which describes the flight and dive that took her son from her, as well as what came after.<br />Among her first discoveries was the fact that sky-diving was almost totally unregulated by any government agency. Jumpers were required to provide their own health insurance coverage, and to sign a tough, tight waiver that obligated the novice jumper to 100% of the risk, and the experienced trainer to no risk whatever. Jumpers were also required to swear that they were over the age of 18 years, but proof was not always required.<br />With the help of friends, both hers and her son's, Melbourne set out to change that oversight. To her surprise, she also discovered that there were other bereaved families out there; parents who had also lost a child on the first jump. First jumps are several times more likely to end in fatality than later jumps. But because of the lack of regulations, there was no way for these bereaved parents or siblings to find each other, except by coincidence.<br />The practice of 'jumping through clouds' is prohibited by common sense, because the jumper cannot see anything, anywhere, but yet that is the feeling that assailed Melbourne and the other families. Details of those fatal flights were not immediately forthcoming, and so closure was an even more difficult process than usual.<br />All Melbourne wanted was better and more comprehensive instruction for sky-diving students, plus some way to rate the safety of various jumping fields. The military has almost no fatalities for new jumpers, but their training is extremely extensive before ever taking to the air. Hard as it might have been for her and the other bereaved parents, at no time did she--or they--even begin to suggest banning jumping. In their generosity, all they wanted was better education for the jumper before that first jump. <br />Although Melbourne was successful in gathering legislative support in several states, eventually her campaign faltered and faded, faced as it was by the vast, intensive support and lobbying from the various support magazines (most notably 'Parachutist' and 'Skydiving') and various skydiving organizations.<br />Ten years later, she readily admits that she obsessed over the details, but she can hardly be blamed for doing so; she merely wanted to know what had happened to her son, and why. Her lament at losing a child readily explains her actions. &quot;I didn't have a spare.&quot;<br />Melbourne is unflinchingly honest, displaying warts and all in her struggle to make this movement safer for everyone involved. One could wish she had been more successful in her quest. This is a book that should be required reading for anyone who even thinks of indulging in such a dangerous challenge. One can hardly call it a sport after reading this very fair, well-researched, heart-felt book.	2003-10-22

They were so funny (as played by Don Ameche and Frances Langford) that they soon acquired a series of their own, and eventually even made it to TV. They were sarcastic and mettlesome, never fearing to go for the jugular, but yet they were never really-completely-mean-spirited. They always kissed and made up by the end of the segment.<br />I was reminded of them, over and over, while reading this book. And yes-it also brought back memories of the classic Kate Hepburn/Spencer Tracy movies as well. Two attractive and exceedingly confident people who KNEW they were right, never even considering otherwise, they were at the same time, lovers par excellence! They acknowledged the magnetic attraction between them, yet never seeming to quite understand it all. <br />Lilah and Drake are wonderfully drawn, completely alive characters who are totally dumbstruck by whatever has happened to them, especially as they have had no prior experience upon which to draw. They both knew exactly the type of mate best suited for them, and it certainly is not this! Why, they don't even much like each other, except-why can't they keep away from each other? Why do they always seem to be touching or kissing? It's enough to astonish anyone, let alone the ones to whom it's happening. <br />I don't believe I've laughed so hard at a book in years and years, and I hated to come to the end of this one. I would happily had read another 342 pages of these two charming people and their wonderment at the situation in which they find themselves. It is greatly to be hoped that the author will find a way to include them as at least minor characters in her future books, just so we may keep an eye on the Regency version of the Bickersons -- the Earl and Countess of Drakesley.	2003-07-24

While the books of Emily Hendrickson have been consistently popular throughout the years, I must admit that they've not always been among my favorites. Certainly, her research cannot be faulted; one could spend many futile hours searching for an anachronism to pop up in one of her books. They are entirely accurate as to time and place and costume and speech, and the reader always knows where and when the story is set. These are elements I find essential in the enjoyment of a Regency novel, but yet, they aren't quite enough in themselves for complete enjoyment of a book. <br />This book, however, was a very pleasant surprise: I truly enjoyed every minute of it. It seemed to have more of a life of its own, perhaps, than her previous books. And, too, the main characters created more sparks than usual, it seemed to me. <br />When I was growing up, the preacher's kids were always the biggest hell-raisers in town. And while the heroine here, Miss Drusilla Herbert isn't exactly in that category, she's certainly no meek little mouse, either. Not by a long shot! She's smart, sensible, kind-hearted, and very out-spoken, when it seems appropriate, and perhaps sometimes when it isn't quite. She's a charmer, through and through. <br />As one of six children (of a parish rector, to be sure) she's learned tolerance along with her other skills and attributes, and when the Marchioness of Brentford (a schoolfriend of Drusilla's mother) needs a companion while recuperating from an illness, Drusilla would seem to fill the bill admirably. Off she goes to Brentford Court. <br />In London, meanwhile, Adrian, the current Marquess, hears tales of his mother's house party and new companion, which rub him entirely the wrong way. How dare his mother be having parties if she's supposed to be ill? And just who is this companion anyway? She needn't think she'll benefit in any way from tending his mother. Oh, no! He'll go home and straighten this matter out in short order, send the companion packing, and then be able to resume his active life in town once again. <br />Adrian's good friend, Lord Ives, joins the house-party as does the woman Adrian's mother thinks could just make a good next marchioness, the Lady Felicia Tait. There are also several older folks including Lord Osman, who's taken quite a shine to the current marchioness. <br />From their first meeting, the sparks fly between Adrian and Drusilla, much to the surprise of both of them. He thinks she's an interfering and meddlesome minx, and she thinks he's an uncaring town beau. Her tart tongue sets him straight as to his mother, but he still harbors doubts about Drusilla. She begins to wonder if her earlier assessment of him was correct, after all. Of course, she's hardly a suitable match for him, but then, there is Lord Ives who at least seems to appreciate her. Until he is drawn more and more to Lady Felicia.  <br />This is the premise of this delightful house-party book, which departs from the norm with its cast of supporting characters, and a neat twist in the plot before all is revealed. We end up with not just one happy match, but three!	2003-07-12

Not so in this particular case, however. This one should have died aborning. <br />To be sure, anything written by Rex Stout cannot be other than gracefully written, while exhibiting a thorough knowledge of the setting and any other details necessary to the plot. This IS well-written, and as far as I can tell, an accurate recreation of the period of 1914, just before the outbreak of World War I, when there were still myriad little princedoms scattered about Europe, each with their own Prince. Or Duke, perhaps, although here we have a prince. <br />We have also a Mata Hari type who quite defies description! And a TSTL male lead character. (That means 'too stupid to live' for the uninitiated.) There is an ingenue, and a quite nice young diplomat and a villain who isn't really, plus the aforementioned prince.     <br />Richard Stetton, a wealthy young American afflicted with wanderlust happens on a riot in Fasilica, wherever that is in middle Europe, somewhere, more near the Orient and Asia than the continental areas with which we're more familiar, such as France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and so forth. When he sees the out-of-control troops attack a convent, he rushes to assist anyone he can find. Thus he meets up with a devastatingly beautiful blonde, Aline Solini and her younger, orphaned friend, Vivi Janvour. Better he had run in the opposite direction several hours earlier. But he didn't, and for the next 300+ pages, the reader is treated to the impossible, the improbable, and the unbelievable. <br />Frankly, I cannot believe that Rex Stout approved this venture--having the 25 chapters put into  book form, rather than being spread out over several months in the telling. Perhaps if one were to read it, one chapter per week, it would be more palatable and less laughable. It won't tarnish Stout's brilliant reputation, except to those who've never read the Nero Wolfe books. What a pity if it should discourage anyone from reading those books or the short stories or novellas about Nero and Archie and their cohorts, which are entirely splendid.  <br />This effort, however, reeks of an attempt by someone to generate income using the defenseless author who died several years ago, and is no longer able to defend himself from such nefarious schemes.	2003-06-20

Some people only want to get where they're going--in a BIG hurry--so they'll even jump on the interstate for just a few blocks. They could care less what scenery there may be or what they might be missing in the process. It's \\"hurry up, already. Let's get there!\\" <br />Others prefer to meander along, taking their time, savoring the view from here or there, and yes--smelling the roses. Either method is perfectly valid, depending on a lot of variables. <br />But -- The Fortune Hunter is not for people in a hurry. No way. It needs--deserves--to be read slowly, and savored, word by word. Scene by scene. If you gallop through this book, you'll miss 90% of the lovely humorous bantering between George, Baron Rival and Olivia, Lady Fairfax. And what a shame that would be. These two use words, even in the most casual of circumstances, in ways that would put any other two fictional lovers totally to shame. Delicious is the only word to describe this wordplay.<br />So what if there is no explicit love scene? Excuse me? This book is nothing if not nearly one long continuous love scene! Who needs explicit, when there is the most erotic yet innocent seduction imaginable in chapter twelve? The pages themselves produce steam as George removes one of Olivia's gloves. Only a glove!  And then there is chapter twenty-one. Oh, my stars and garters! This is writing of the very highest quality, perfectly matched by two delightful, fully developed characters in a plot full of twists and turns. In short, this is a masterpiece. <br />Poor Lord Rival (in more ways than one!) must marry an heiress if he is to restore his ancestral holdings. In order to accomplish this, he has carefully made up a list of the most eligible women who matched that description. The elusive, enigmatic Lady Olivia Fairfax was at the very top of the list. Only problem was, he'd never seen the lady, and neither had anyone else he knew. But then, he discovered someone who had seen her. After many weekly bouts of cribbage with this elderly gentleman, before Rival even had a chance to propose a possible meeting, the man died, leaving Rival back at square one. But maybe not, as Rival is called in for the reading of the will. And of course, so is Olivia. Sparks fly in all directions, and the chase is on! <br />During most of history, once a man and woman married (each other) he owned her, and she was his to do with as he wished, up to and including spending her entire fortune any way he wished, or even beating her so severely she could easily die from the injuries. Of course, she could not have the same freedoms, oh, no. It's no wonder that independent, wealthy Olivia chose not to marry, considering the men with whom she was the most familiar--her father and half-brother--were this brutal sort. As if to demonstrate this unhappy side of marriage even more clearly, the author uses Olivia's half-brother's brutalities against his wife, Edith, to back-up Olivia's decision to remain unwed. It's a perfectly brilliant metaphor. <br />But all that was before Lord Rival came on the scene. Sometimes, others know us better than we know ourselves. When that happens, it's just so much easier to capitulate and let someone else make the decisions. Especially when those decisions are the ones we most wish we could make. <br />Since many of the other reviews have gone into great detail about the plot, another such is not really necessary. Just read this book slowly, and give it the time it needs to breathe. Like the very best of fine wine, it sparkles and bubbles with great vivacity. Sip slowly and enjoy!	2003-05-31

Another second book that lives up to the expectations created by the first one. Deborah Morgan's first mystery novel 'Death is a Cabaret' was marvelous, I thought, and I'm delighted to say I was not one teensy bit disappointed in this one. <br />Jeff Talbot is a most interesting character, very real and multi-faceted, and one of the author's greatest strengths is how well she gets in his head. A former FBI agent, Jeff is now an antique 'picker' searching out delectable items for his antique dealer friends and acquaintances. His wife, Sheila is housebound, due to a severe case of agoraphobia. She's become a whiz on the web, providing valuable assistance when Jeff is out in the field.<br />The Weedless Widow is an antique fishing lure, appropriate to the setting of the Northwest US, in and around Seattle, where water is everywhere. Jeff and several of his pals--of varying backgrounds--have traditionally spent time at a fishing camp, doing the 'male bonding' thing, enjoying each other's company, the fishing, and good food. Until this current trip, when he discovers Bill Rhodes, the owner of The Weedless Widow and host for the weekend, lying dead on the floor of his fishing tackle and bait store, surrounded by an assortment of tropical fish. Not all the fish are dead, however, and one of the clues to the time of death is how long a certain fish can exist out of water. <br />There are several other esoteric-type clues, too; in a computer, for instance, or the recently-renovated home of the dead man, or the fishing regalia of the camp-mates. In addition, it seems that Bill's extensive collection of antique lures is missing, but Bill had been hot on the trail of the thief. Could this be why he was murdered? All in all, the clues are fairly distributed, and lead to the logical solution. <br />One of the better fictional characters I've met in recent years is the Sheriff who keeps the law and order intact. Colleen McIvers is recuperating from a bout with cancer, but doesn't let that get in her way, as she sifts through the various clues while searching for the killer. <br />Along the way, Sheila is kidnapped, and Jeff has to realign his priorities all the while dealing with treachery among those he thought were his best friends. <br />There is a webliography as well as a bibliography at the back of the book, providing information on the many sources consulted by the author during the writing of the book. It's a fabulous treat. Now, it's just wait for the next one in the series.	2003-05-27

The author has created a terrific protagonist in Carnegie Kincaid, a six foot tall redhead, who lives on a houseboat on Lake Union  just north of downtown Seattle. From there she also operates her struggling business, Made In Heaven Wedding Designs. Surrounded by a cadre of unique and very talented friends of the sort needed by a wedding planner, Carnegie not only knows Seattle like the palm of her hand, she provides the reader with a constantly entertaining travelogue. Seattle, of course, is the home of lots of water, the Space Needle, and the fairly new Experience Music Project on the grounds of the Seattle Center. The EMP would be a wonderful place for anything at all, considering it was designed by the world-famous architect, Frank Gehry, noted for his uniquely marvelous swooping and swirling buildings. Seattle is also the home of Microsoft. And millionaires.<br />It is one of these latter persons, Elizabeth Lamott, a 29 year-old female, now retired from Microsoft, who is the current bride. With tons of money at her disposal, she can ask for anything; getting it is sometimes the problem. Her groom is Paul Wheeler, news editor for the Seattle Sentinel. <br />The opening scene of their coed bachelor party at the Seattle Aquarium is delicious--the guests are all in masquerade, which of course, interferes greatly with trying to solve the murder of a bridesmaid that takes place during the party. <br />Several of Carnegie's friends from the first book appear in this one as well. Aaron Gold, a reporter who has a nose for gossip as well as news, seems to always pop up just when he shouldn't. It's fairly obvious he has his eye on Carnegie, but from her six-foot vantage point, his five-foot-eight or so is little more than a pest. Lily James, the black librarian and single Mom who supports Carnegie no matter what;Boris, the very Russian floral designer and Eddie, Carnegie's business partner. <br />Add to this mix the very punk and lesbian Juice Nugent, cake baker extraordinaire, plus police Detective Lieutenant Michael Graham, and you have the ingredients for a possibly zany merry-go-round. Donnelly's writing and story-telling ability, however, are splendid, and she keeps a tight rein on all these disparate elements, never letting any one aspect overshadow any other.  <br />Personally, I thought the book well worth reading for this one sentence: \\"My current finances restricted me to a charming little vehicle, lovingly crafted in Eastern Europe, that combined the roomy elegance of a soup can with the horsepower of a sewing machine.\\" My daughter had one of those cars, and I think a better description was never penned. Never! <br />It would be hard to find a more enjoyable book, I think. Now, to develop a bit of patience while waiting for the next one.	2003-05-27

All he needs is a wife. An unsuitable wife, of course, one who is totally unsuitable for that position. Except that he really does not want to get married. So where will he find this a wife who isn't a wife? In addition to being somewhat unreliable,  (actresses are prone to bow out at the last moment when a real acting job appears!) they're also too expensive. But then re realizes he knows the owner of a bawdy house, and so he appeals to Sallie Ellis for help. <br />By chance, considering his partiality for red hair, Sallie realizes she has the perfect nominee right in her kitchen! Although a working woman, to be sure, Molly Sweet is the cook for Sallie's employees while yet not being one of them. Molly's dream is to someday own an inn, and threfore is working to save up enough money to be able to purchase one. Molly is an orphan, knowing little of her antecedents or current family, although she's definitely not a girl of the streets. She knows that her father was with the Army in India, and after both her parents succumbed to cholera, an uncle took her in. <br />Unfortunately, he soon became ill himself, and one of his last acts was to ship Molly home to England and her family. These plans went awry, however, and Molly found herself alone on the docks. A bright girl, she set about finding work, which is how she ended up, some years later, in Sallie's kitchen. <br />After having driven away his older son by his roughshod tactics, Theo's father, who is a bully, threatens to do the same to Theo. The young man decides to precipitate such action by engaging Molly to be his pretend sweetheart, prompting his real disinheritance, thus leaving himfree to live his own life. <br />As Molly and Theo discover more and more about each other, and the various incidents that have made them as they are, they find more in common than otherwise, to their mutual surprise. When Terrence (the previously disinherited older brother) comes home to see Theo's strumpet for himself, he unwittingly prompts Molly into giving the three Winslow men a good piece of her mind. She then leaves for London, and the familiar and warm kitchen at Sallie's house. <br />A Proper Mistress is a pleasant change of pace, about a young woman who has no idea of how to be a proper mistress, and a young man who decides that, after all is said and done, he doesn't want one, anyway. What he really wants isa wife! Theo and Molly are engaging, well-drawn characters who'll tug at your heart as they fumble their way through the obstacles strewn along the path to true love. Their story is told with a gentle sense of humor by the author, who is also very capable of more serious books. Most enjoyable.	2003-05-05
US	50289674	RMKOZYSIIQY52	0451208587	543688963	Lavender Blue (Signet Regency Romance)	Books	5	7	12	N	N	Lavender has many lives --	Classical mythology, from the days of Ancient Greece, traditionally tells a story in one of three styles. First, are imaginative tales of the gods and other supernatural beings; second is the saga or legend, and third are the folktales or popular fiction, if you will. Many of the characters of these stories derived from different countries in different eras of history, and it would take a more scholarly person than I am to de-bunk the entire concept. I prefer to believe there is at least a smidgeon of reality to even the most fantastical story, which may be one reason why I so adore-and admire-the writing of Sandra Heath. <br />No matter which bit of ancient lore she chooses to embellish her fiction, it is after all, just that. Fiction. But, in my estimation, it is fiction of the very highest caliber; well-written, witty, clever, endearing, and with just enough of the fantastical to prompt one to think, 'it could have happened that way!'  Certainly, stranger things happen nearly every day in our world, so why couldn't such strange things have happened nearly two hundred years ago? It's all illusion, all fiction, all entertaining. <br />'Lavender Blue, dilly dilly, Lavender Green. If I were king, dilly dilly, you'd be my queen' has been a popular folksong for several hundred years. It didn't just appear for the first time on the hit parade of 1949 or 1959 (both years saw high sales for various renditions, following an appearance in a movie of 1949), and obviously, it had some meaning at the time of its birth. Lavender (in blue or various other shades) dates to Biblical times and has been used for a multitude of purposes: food (Elizabeth I, for example), laundry (laundry/lavender=logical?), medicine, air freshener and last but not least, aphrodisiac. <br />In &quot;Lavender Blue&quot;, the latest book from Ms. Heath, a sprig of lavender (out of season) serves as a charm against witchcraft. It may also serve as a love charm when presented by Jovian Cathness, Duke of Chavanage, to his love, Lady Anthea Wintour, daughter of the Earl of Daneway. Although ideally matched, the course of true love has not run smoothly for this pair. For unknown reasons, Jovian has apparently taken to the bottle, seriously disturbing Anthea, who, in spite of her inner self advising against such things, believes the next-to-impossible stories of Jovian's behavior while in a state of intoxication.<br />Why-wasn't he observed, flying to the upper windows of his townhouse? Or making a wine bottle slide across the table to him? And doesn't it seem as though she can hear him speak to her, when he isn't even there? Not to mention those occasions when he can absolutely read her mind! <br />The summer of 1814 saw numerous celebrations and an influx of visitors to London, the result of Napoleon's apparent defeat. For Anthea, however, and her aunt Letty, the news is of a different sort. In short order, the Earl has married for the second time, and been suddenly widowed again. In the process, he has acquired a step-daughter, Corinna Pranton, just a year or two younger than Anthea, and he asks Anthea to welcome Corinna into her heart as well as their home, Daneway House. <br />Corinna, being much less sophisticated than Anthea, falls under the charm of Sir Erebus Lethe, a handsome stranger who presents the young girl with a sprig of mistletoe while telling her it's really narcissus. Aunt Letty, unaware of this event, decides that the Viscount Heversham would make the perfect husband for her new charge. Alas. 'Twas not to be. Or was it? <br />Not having known any family previously, Corinna is entranced to meet an aunt, the twin of her mother, who goes by the name of Abigail Wheatley. But Abigail appears at the strangest times, usually following several claps of thunder, and frequently leaving tracks behind herself. Hare tracks. <br />Throughout recorded history, there has always been a mysticism associated with harvest. Every ethnic group has celebrations to thank whatever Deity they believe in for the abundant crops, or to beseech for forgiveness in case of a less than wonderful yield. Demeter is the goddess of the harvest and it is around her (not to mention Zeus and Persephone and Hades-- and even Cerberus) that this story is woven-including the mysterious nineteen year cycle,  when the lavender blooms out of season, the harvest is ready, and there are two full moons in August.<br />All these events take place in the first half of the book. But you shouldn't quit reading just yet! Persist, and the rewards will be great, as the various and seemingly unconnected threads of this story are interwoven into one sumptuous entity. Only one word of advice -- things are never quite what they seem to be for any of the characters in this book, whether hero or villain, young or old, silly or sensible. There is a reason for everything for everything that happens, and the author makes even the most improbable seem logical. It all ends happily for nearly everyone, including Aunt Letty and her long-lost love! Purely marvelous!	2003-04-01

From the hands of a capable (even when unknown) writer, short stories are often better reading than the overblown, over-written, over-pretentious stuff that sometimes passes for novels these days. I found this to be true of this volume, even though the author is hardly unknown to me, whereas all but two of the stories were. Indeed, Les Roberts is a very well-known and well-regarded author of a good many full-length books, although this is his first volume of just short stories. I laughed a lot, caught my breath a few times, and came close to tears once, but I thought the stories were rather uniformly excellent. Better yet, they were all highly enjoyable. <br />All ten of the stories in this collection had been previously published elsewhere, which means, I suppose, that it'll be a while before we'll be graced with another such compilation. Too bad. Roberts is a smooth, descriptive writer; not only do the well-chosen words resound in your head as you read, but the images he creates present themselves full-blown for your visual inspection. This collection also demonstrates his sense of humor along with the wry tone he usually provides.<br />If I had to pick a favorite, it might be &quot;THE CATNAP&quot;. But then again, it might be &quot;THE FAT STAMP&quot; or even &quot;THE BRAVE LITTLE COSTUME DESIGNER&quot;. 'Catnap' is one that I'd read in the collection for which it was written. I thought it the best of the litter then, and still do, I think. 'Stamp' was new to me, and it evoked a chuckle or two as I read, while reminding me of various sightings, etc. 'Costume Designer' appealed to me for other reasons; the story satisfied all of them.<br />On the other hand, the weakest one, in my opinion, was &quot;GOOD BOYS&quot;, which is the other story I'd read previously. I didn't care too much for it the first time around, either, thinking that perhaps a few more words would have allowed the magic to generate a bit better. But, still it was a whole lot better than many shorts I've read in other more highly publicized anthologies. <br />I was especially pleased to find a short version of Milan Jacovich, my personal favorite of Roberts' creations. Being reasonably familiar with the event that provided the impetus for the story made it more compelling to read. <br />The author states in the introduction to one of the stories &quot;I am often called 'retro' and wear the mantle proudly.&quot; Me, too. Maybe that's another reason why I found this such an enjoyable book to read! If only more publishers would catch on to the allure of the short story, and provide more such collections, readers who find this genre to be so fascinating would be greatly enriched. And who knows? There might even be a good many new converts! And then, they'd have to publish even more such collections!	2003-02-14

Not a Viennese waltz, to be sure, but the rhythm, the pacing, the twists and turns, the notes-both sweet and not-so-sweet, abound throughout. You'll love it! <br />From the rather inauspicious beginning near the fish-market in Weymouth to the final glittering moments of Lady Holland's Golden Ball, the waltz is a constant factor in this delightful book. Its first notes are in the mind of Miss Freddie Smith (Winifred to her mother) as she dons a disguise to barter for better prices from the local fish-monger. More than anything in the world, Freddie longs for a night or two in London, where she might indulge in the scandalous dance craze--the waltz--newly imported from Austria. She is quite certain that after a very few nights of such participation in the social whirl of the *ton*, she could and would willingly return to her normal life. If, that is, she hasn't managed to capture the heart and hand of a handsome fellow who would take her for his wife.  <br />Quite unbeknownst to her, a dashing young lord, Cassian Stratford, the Marquess of Lansdale, who has been banished to Weymouth by the Queen-no less-has observed her mission to the fish-market, and also been amused by the antics of the young woman's companion. Thomas Tomcat by name, he of the shiny black furcoat with a white bib, is determined to have his share of the mackerel that respose in the market basket. <br />Of course, there's more. There's the young heiress Lavinia Thorogood, whose father was injured in a carriage accident very near the front door of the boarding house run by Freddie's mother, and while Father recuperates, the two young ladies become fast friends. Lavinia is to journey to London to share a come-out with two cousins at the home of their aunt, Lady Bellamy. However, a match is in train for Lavinia with Magnus, the earl of Kerswell. Of course, Lavinia has, in the meantime, fallen for a young Byron clone, Andrew Beaumont by name. <br />Lavinia decides she needs Freddie's company on the trip to London, along with that of a chaperone hired by Mr. Thorogood. Judith Shaw is a military widow, who seems to be more aware of the surroundings than her charges. When Cassian and Magnus spend a night in the same town on their way to London, the scene is set for a multi-faceted showdown. <br />These are the main themes of this waltz, from which the entertaining variations ensue. And entertaining they are. Crisply written, lavishly adorned with humor, and a soupçon each of romance and intrigue and adventure, FALSE STEPS is one joyful measure after another. Indulge! You'll be happy that you did.	2003-01-04

That latter is one of the reasons why I've greatly enjoyed all the novels by Monica Harris. The former is why I really LOVED this one - A MURDEROUS YARN. <br />There is a great deal of skill involved in combining two very non-traditional and opposite elements such as antique autos and needlecraft, and Ms. Harris has succeeded wonderfully, in my opinion. Of course, first of all, she created the multi-faceted Betsy Devonshire, a transplanted West-coaster who moved back to the Midwest to visit her sister, and re-acquaint herself with the area in which they'd grown up. When her sister is murdered however, Betsy not only inherits the shop and it's employees--her new extended family--but she also discovers resources within herself that she hadn't previously realized were there. In addition, whichever needlecraft is highlighted in the story also contributes to the solution, a very clever bit of business. <br />Being a woman of a 'certain age' brings all sorts of possibilities to a character, and Betsy is absolutely typical of this. More than that, however, Betsy is clever, intelligent, hard-working, likes to think outside-the-box, and isn't at all reluctant to admit that she doesn't know everything. <br />Thanks to her previous escapades, Betsy has become best friends with a local policewoman, Jill Cross. In this story, Lars Larsen (Jill's love) has sold his 'hobby farm' to indulge in yet another hobby--the rather expensive one of owning an original Stanley Steamer, which he puts back together again after a small accident with the previous owner, and prepares to become an active member of the Minnesota Antique Car Club.<br />To her surprise, Betsy discovers she also has a love for these old vehicles, and offers to sponsor Lars and his car, in exchange for being included in the adventures, and adorning the car with a banner proclaiming the name of her shop - 'Crewel World'.  She also becomes a volunteer, helping with various aspects of the antique car social world.<br />During the very first run, however, tragedy strikes when one of the old cars, which had been misbehaving badly, catches fire and very nearly incinerates the owner. Or did it? Was it the car, or was it a person who did the dastardly deed? Whichever, the result is the same--Bill Birmingham is dead, and his widow Charlotte has an iron-clad alibi provided by Betsy. <br />While telling us a great deal of antique car--and club--history, Betsy also pursues the truth of the matter, because unsolved puzzles bother her. As an amateur sleuth, Betsy isn't constrained by the legal rules that govern official investigations, and with her unique way of looking at things, she can find solutions that sometimes evade the police. Even the handsome and enigmatic Detective Sergeant Morrie Steffans, who is apparently going to become a regular character in this series. Or is he?<br />A puzzle that only the author can solve. Stick around for the ride -- you'll enjoy it.	2002-12-08

From the very first edition, the quality has always been high, although to be sure, some have been higher than others. To me, this one is the very best of the bunch. It is as though each author has gone a little beyond her normal wonderful skills, and created something a bit more special than usual for this year of 2002. Four of the authors are favorites from past years; Edith Layton was in the very first book, so it's only appropriate that she lead off. Sandra Heath, Carla Kelly and Barbara Metzger have each been in several of the books, while Amanda McCabe is a worthy newcomer to the collection.<br />In some years, the books have had a theme, but this year they're just wonderful, heart-warming stories. Edith Layton's \\"The Amiable Miser\\" gives us a different look at a miserly sort of fellow, but one with the proverbial heart of gold. And even though he didn't really have to spend any of his valuables, he was still able to provide his niece with her heart's desire.<br />Barbara Metzger turns from her usual menagerie to the 'infantry' in the delightful \\"A Home for Hannah\\". Hannah is an orphan, or so she and the rest of the world thinks, until one day in the park, she spies a likely candidate to be her new 'Papa', thus setting in motion all sorts of interesting activities. Her new Papa is a penniless gentleman who discovers that love can indeed conquer all.<br />\\"A Partridge in a Pear Tree\\" by Amanda McCabe proves that the eye of the beholder may not always see the same things as the rest of the world, but in the end, it is the one who sets the rules that wins the game. Simplicity is, in many instances, much better than grandiose ideas, as established by Lady Kirkwood with her competition. Of course, the Lady wins out, bringing together two young relatives, Allison and William, who discover the true meaning of Christmas.<br />Certainly there are elves afoot at Christmastime; if you have doubts, youneed do no more than read \\"The Solid Silver Chess Set\\" by Sandra Heath. If you then still have doubts, you can have no heart, no soul, and no sense of humor, either. The trials of poor little Bramble Bumblekin will bring a smile to your heart if you will but let them, and your soul will be warmed by the reunion of the formerly-fickle Miss Julia and her erstwhile suitor, Philip. Even young Bramble's holiday is made brighter by the inventive imagination of the author.<br />And finally, Carla Kelly unveils the solution to a mystery in \\"No Room at the Inn\\", allowing the young Mary to find not only her identity but her family as well. Twice over, in fact, when Joe also settles her into a love-filled home she'd never thought to have.<br />Any of these stories will provide a magnum of holiday cheer; together they'll warm your chilly nights and make you think of happy holidays! Enjoy!	2002-11-20

Whether one is artistically literate or not, it is entirely possibly to appreciate the marvelous etchings of M.(Maurits) C. Escher. I feel privileged to own two large prints, several calendars and a book or two of Escher prints or drawings. Of course, you can easily drive yourself batty by staring at them too much, or maybe it's that one should be a bit loopy in the first place in order to really be enchanted by the illusive possibilities created by this extremely gifted artist.<br />Having discovered the books of another extremely gifted artist, Jane Langton-at the time of her first Homer Kelly book-I feel doubly privileged. Therefore I can and do happily admit to a certain amount of prejudice in favor of this book, combining two of my favorite things. Ms. Langton writes not only with great skill, but great erudition, wit, and just plain wonderful word-play. One small note of caution, however: the reader should approach this book with the sense of whimsicality fully engaged, as it very like a trip to Wonderland, replete with White Queens and peacocks and other such frivoloties.<br />There is indeed a mystery to be solved, including that of 'love at first sight'. It does happen, to be sure, although the resolution is not always as happy as that first 'rush' insinuates. In this book, the reader will need every smidgen of loopiness possible to cope with not only the wonderful word-play and the marvelous reproductions of Escher's etchings (as described in his own words) but also the slightly bizarre events which entangle and draw the various characters into the plot.<br />Leonard Sheldrake, a professor at Harvard, briefly meets the elusive Frieda at an Escher exhibit. Before he can further the acquaintance, which suddenly assumes a major importance in his life, Frieda disappears, and he is left with only the mental picture of her that he carries in his mind, and the tiny tid-bit of information that is her first name. No last name, no address, no clues at all. Into thismaelstrom wander Homer and Mary Kelly, also professors at Harvard, who engage themselves to assist Leonard in his search.<br />There is an unexpectedly happy ending, but not without some very skillful weaving together of the various threads that had been so laboriously tangled in the previous pages. Just as in an Escher drawing, nothing is extraneous, here, too, this law prevails. No clue is too small to be relevant. I believe that anyone could enjoy this book, but persons who enjoy puzzles or word-games or the multi-dimensional world of M. C. Escher will find an extra level of enjoyment within its pages.	2002-09-23

T. Jefferson has imposed himself into the story. At the same time, he keeps the spotlight on the early 1940s in the Pennsylvania town of Robinsville. Thus we still see our old friends Kate Fallon, who is still doing her part for the war effort as a welder at the local factory while her fiance is in Africa or somewhere overseas; and Sparky MacFarland, the newspaper man who believes in the goodness of people--especially those in small towns; and Mrs. B, the British ex-pat who owns the local bookstore. <br />As December, 1942 turns into January, 1943, Robinsville is astonished to learn that one of its own, Johnny Groover, is coming home from the war in the Pacific--as a bona fide hero! Although never a really bad kid, Johnny ventured from the straight and narrow one time, and got caught, along with several other young men, after having committed an armed robbery. Johnny, being only the lookout, was offered the opportunity to join the Marine Corps --or go to prison. He became a Marine. And after stopping more than a few bullets in a fierce battle--a hero. <br />He is astonished to learn that he'll be presented with the Medal of Honor by no less than the President--Franklin Roosevelt, after a homecoming and celebration in Robinsville. But something goes horribly awry, and Johnny never gets his medal. <br />Presented in flashbacks, prompted by the 60 year-old newspaper stories of the event, the young reporter, M. T. Jefferson, is sent to interview the 90-something MacFarland, the only survivor of that era, who was old enough then to know something of what happened. Kate's young brother Paul, is now the editor of the local paper, and he wants to know what MacFarland knows, but has steadfastly refused to reveal. He gives the young reporter contraband cigars with which to bribe the aging but still sharp MacFarland, and the chase is on! <br />As in the other books, the research exhibited in this story is nothing short of awesome! The songs, the movies, the stars--all are given their due here in this story of a world we'll probably never see again--much to our detriment. However he chooses to present the next story, I'll look forward to reading it. You should, too, even if you're not old enough to remember it as it happened!	2002-09-18
US	50289674	R3MS4PXTOXXEA	0814909191	110839191	Deadly variations	Books	4	1	1	N	N	How times have changed --	To find out just how much our world has changed in the last ten to fifteen years, one has but to read a 'thriller' or 'espionage' type novel of the late 1980s. When the Iron Curtain descended for the final time, this entire genre of novels became almost superfluous. Almost--but not quite, especially if they were well done and believable in the first place.<br />To me, thankfully, the 'Deadly . . .' books by Paul Myers are in this latter category, as classical music is one of my passions, and Mr. Myers knows very well whereof he writes! Having spent his working career as a producer and recording engineer for some of the biggest names in the classical music world, (The Cleveland Orchestra and George Szell among them) he is very well equipped to write about the musical world. <br />His travels, obviously, also provided him with background information about the major cities and concert halls in his world. The reader may never be fortunate enough to visit these marvelous venues in person, but the six books in this series will take you to a good many of them, as Mark Holland does dual-duty as an artist's agent and previous-but-dragged-into-it-again undercover agent for the UKs 'Department'. <br />This first book, written well in advance of the curtain's descent leans heavily on the rescue of an East German scientist twelve years before the story opens. It appears that he's now stumbled on an important discovery -- a deadly formula for germ warfare. Since Mark is the man who brought him out from behind the Wall, he trusts him -- and only him -- so Mark is brought back into the department. Temporarily. <br />Of course, it doesn't work quite that way -- once an agent, always an agent, it seems. In spite of his protests Mark finds himself in Vienna, New York and London before returning home to Geneva and yet more treachery. Music lovers will enjoy the tidbits of gossip, while trying to figure out 'who is this?' whereas those readers who like espionage- type thrillers should be satisfied with this fast-paced story that abounds in twists and turns. The final clue is a dandy! It could only have happened in a musical world. I'm off to re-read Deadly Cadenza, the next book in the series. Too bad the series can't be re-issued!	2002-09-03

Eventually, when a dozen or so of these little gems had accrued in the author's basket, they would be brought out in their own separate volume. Many of these collections are as well known as the authors' full-length novels. <br />Following this lead, Mr. Rankin displays a sure touch with this batch of shorter stories, all of which feature Detective Inspector John Rebus of the Edinburgh police force. There are other continuing characters as well, who surface here or there,  providing a spot of humor or compassion or just camaraderie. <br />I'd not read anthing by Mr. Rankin before finding this book. That situation is about to be remedied as I go looking for &quot;Knots and Crosses&quot; to begin at the beginning of the Inspector Rebus tales. I would highly recommend a similar path to any other devoted readers of mystery novels, especially those who treasure a setting that's nearly part of the plot, characters with whom one can practically form a friendship, and above all, exellent writing.	2002-09-02

In more ways than one. He tends to see things in black and white, strongly filtered through his own unique sense of ethics. Would there more people everywhere like him. <br />This book, in particular, also abounds with terrific philosophical sayings such as: \\"Michael Jordan says that you always miss the shot you don't take.\\" Yup. You do. Which ought to convince folks to make more attempts at the things that mean the most to them.  Six pages earlier was my favorite: \\"A very wise Clevelander once told me that gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues but the parent of all the others.\\" <br />As a devoted reader of this series, I was very upset when, in the previous book, Milan's boyhood pal, Lt. Marko Meglich took a bullet intended for Milan. (Not that I wanted to lose Milan, because I certainly didn't. I just didn't want to lose Marko, either.) It was somewhat appeasing that six months later, Milan is also still suffering the loss. It is in order to shake him up some that another old friend, the newspaperman Ed Stahl, recommends Milan for a job with a Hollywood film company that's shooting in Cleveland. The job is as a glorified baby-sitter for the young male star of the film - the 24 year-old Darren Anderson. <br />Darren, however, resents the 'tending' and point blank tells Milan to leave him alone for one particular Sunday, the end of which sees Darren in a new role--that of corpse. Milan takes it personally, and sets out to find the killer, even if he no longer has a real client. Along the way, we meet some familiar folk from previous books, as well as a new love for Milan. This is good, as he definitely needed one. <br />If you've ever wondered about Cleveland, the Milan Jacovich books will show you the real thing, warts and all, but subtly mixed in with the rest of the cityscape that those of us who live here, love as much as Milan does.  His descriptions of the places he visits should endear him to the Chamber of Commerce, while the taut story lines, unique characterizations and marvelous writing should endear him to readers of all kinds of books.	2002-08-24

I know, she's not really been anywhere, but for the past few years, the author has been busily writing great mysteries, historical romances and the occasional Regency novel under a different name. Her own, in fact. And while I can honestly say I admire her books no matter which name they're published under, for me, there is an undeniable attraction to her Mary Kingsley books. This one is no exception. <br />Chloe Russell is not the ordinary Regency miss; her interests lie entirely elsewhere than the usual round of gossip and at-homes and Almack's. In addition to a wonderful brain and considerable artistic talent, she feels she has also been blessed with two left feet, leading to the embarrassing appelation of Miss Bumblebroth. And of course, she is a considerable heiress. <br />Orphaned at a rather young age, Chloe has been brought up with an older brother, and a pair of cousins. Her brother married the girl cousin, leaving the boy to grow into a man of questionable taste and habits. One of his favorite things to do is tease Chloe, by far the youngest of the batch, thus adding to her already developed sense of clumsiness. <br />And, now living as she must with her brother and sister-in-law in London, Chloe is devastated by the news that an arranged marriage is at her threshold, planned years ago by the two fathers. Of course, she's heard of Michael, Viscount Lyndon, heir to the Earl of Grantham. Who hasn't? Why, he's one of the premier Corinthians of the day! Superbly athletic in every venue, grace personified, and she's to marry him? <br />Well, yes, it appears so, and almost before she knows it, Chloe has become Michael's bride. Their journey of discovery is a enticing one for the reader, and not quite the usual marriage of convenience story. Layer by layer, Ms. Kingsley expertly unveils her two slightly-wounded characters, allowing them to comfort and discover each other by turns. Throughout these first months of their marriage, they will learn the values that will keep them in good stead for many years to come; trust, loyalty, and above all-love.<br />This is truly a scrumptious book! Enjoy it for yourself.	2002-08-14

If you've ever had a less-than-happy experience with an attorney, you'll LOVE this book! It's everyone's fantasy about how to rid oneself of an enemy. Or perceived enemy, at any rate. <br />Joanna Davis is a wonderful creation; a police detective on the LAPD force who is tough yet sensitive, smart yet cautious, feminine but strong, a very young grandmother and an almost-menopausal woman, all rolled into one delightful bunch of contradictions. Any woman who reads this book would like to have a Joanna in her life as a friend.<br />Of course, almost anyone who reads this book would probably like to have the 'perp' as a friend, too, as long as one stayed on his good side. He's clever and funny and thoughtful and kind to the elderly; it's just most of the legal profession of which he's not overly fond. <br />This is a delightful book, satisfying in every way; it's well-written with a most unusual plot, right up to and including the last page, and peopled by characters you won't soon forget. I'm off to find more books by this author who was previously unknown to me. No longer, though.	2002-08-14

(Claire Rawlings Mystery)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Lovely debut --	Witty, wry, laugh-out-loud in places--what more could a reader of mystery novels want? This one has it all--plot, characterization (and then some!) and wonderful writing. As the first of a series, it helps to be read first, also, as the second book in the series has some spoilers, just in case you mess up. But that's okay, really, as once you're into this book, you won't really care, anyway.<br />On the other hand, the characters are so well drawn that you'll be happy to become better acquainted with them. This first book should hold your interest quite nicely, I think. Claire Rawlings is an editor at Ardor House, and has two best-selling authors under her wing. Willard Hughes specializes in promoting himself and his mystsery novels, while the other, Blanche DuBois, practically has to be forced into promotion, for her very well-done, best-selling mysteries.<br />When Blanche decides to stray from her usual fiction, and write a straight-forward history of the Ku Klux Klan, Claire is astonished, both by the idea and the excellent manuscript turned in by the author. But before any decision can be made about publication, Blanche is found dead. A homicide? <br />Almost simultaneously, the next two most important characters enter Claire's life; the wonderful Meredith Lawrence, 13 going on 52; and the widower Police Detective Wallace Jackson. Of course, there are other characters as well, and--running through the book like an distant memory, lines from Goethe's famous poem 'Erlkönig' which was later set to music by Schubert. Fortunately, there is a translation at the beginning of the book, affording those of us not fluent in German the ability to follow the tale of the frightened child. <br />Meredith is, however, anything but a frightened child, and eventually finds the missing clues to help Detective Jackson solve the murders. Oh, yes, by this time there are more of them, and Claire herself is dangerously close to being a victim, too. <br />The plot is so complex, yet simple to understand, and the characters many and so multi-faceted in themselves, it's difficult to write a brief yet comprehensive review of this book. I'll say only that I truly enjoyed it, savoring the lyricism of the writing, and will now go back and read the second book--again. Then, on to the third, and so on. I don't think you'll regret doing the same thing.	2002-07-16

Oh, to be an author of Regency Romance novels even half as successful as Juliet Bodine, otherwise known as Angelica Kestrel-Haven! But then, dreams are always wonderful to have, regardless. Even as successful as A K-H is in her work, the very real Juliet still finds boredom a steady visitor, and is always eager to do almost anything other than write. <br />When her college friend, Ruth Renswick, a choreographer for the Jansch Ballet in Manhatten, asks for help with her new venture, GREAT EXPECTATIONS, based on the novel by Charles Dickens, Juliet is drawn in like flies to honey. And the readers are drawn in by the very realistic descriptions of life in and around a ballet troupe. This is the first of a new series on the nine muses; this one, of course, is in honor of Terpsichore, goddess of dance.<br />Unfortunately, the lead male dancer soon turns up dead, and another college friend turns up as the investigating detective. Murray Landis is also a sculptor who plays a wicked game of softball on the side. The two of them--Juliet and Murray--dance their own pas de deux while sorting out the clues that lead everywhere but to the proper conclusion. <br />If you've ever read any Regency novels by Fiona Hill, you'll be prepared for the excellent writing of Ellen Pall, her alter ego. If not, you'll have a wonderful treat with this very witty, very literate, very enjoyable mystery novel that doesn't believe in rushing around, working up a sweat, looking here, there and everywhere for clues. The dancers do enough of that, thank you, but you will also, no doubt, enjoy the vicarious pleasure of visiting Juliet's upper West-Side apartment.

This book, and its companion GODS IN EVERYMAN, were given to me this spring by the love of my life, whom I hadn't seen in twenty years. The first time around, my life was reasonably under control; this time it was in utter turmoil. He gave me the books in the hope I'd find answers to some of life's puzzles within them. <br />And I did, I really did! Having only read this first book, to date, I was astonished to learn who I really am, and how and why I've done many of the things I've done in my life. Some of these things were pretty good, actually, and I'm very proud of them, while some of them have-unfortunately-been the opposite. I'm not sure if having this book at hand during the last twenty years would have made any difference in those actions or not. But, even belatedly, it's helpful to know the whys of some of my choices. <br />There is no way to know how or why I turned out to be a nearly prototypical Aphrodite, but I surely am! There is also just a tiny bit of Artemis and Athena, but not enough to wield any influence, I'm sorry to say. I would never have recognized myself as an Aphrodite until about the age of 25 or so, but after that-my life is a virtual roadmap for her. It's almost as though Dr. Bolen traveled alongside me every inch of the way, and observed all my triumphs and mistakes, the failures and messes and successes, too, and written them up as a  guideline to Aphrodite! Even the discussion of the 'committee' and the way decisions are made, ring very true  to life.<br />I found my mother in here, and knowing why she did some of the things she did, has been a revelation to me. I  can only hope to employ the wisdom found in this book to avoid some of the same mistakes with my daughter,  who is, of course, also to be found in these pages. <br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough to anyone who wants to know more about herself, or, if you're a  man, to discover some of the inner workings of the woman in your life. Age and sexual orientation arealso given consideration, each within the archetype of the relevant goddess. Should you discover yourself (or your  lady) in the very first description,  I would still urge you to read the entire book. It's quite simply marvelous;  well-written, humorous, and serious when necessary. Thank you, my love, and thank you, Dr Bolen!	2002-07-15

One never knows which door will next open to reveal the treasures hidden within. But regardless of the revelation, one knows it can only be from the very inventive mind of Sandra Heath. I mean, who else would come up with a clumsy cuckoo a loquacious leopard, and a lavender lightning bug!  So, okay, it isn't exactly a 'lightning bug', but flying spark isn't nearly as alliterative.  When she adds these things to a sunken forest and village, along with an ancient island fortress/monastery/castle, it becomes purely delightful magic. <br />Kate Kingsley is a widow with an eight-year-old son, Justin. Gerent Fitzarthur, Lord Carismont, is a widower with a seven-year-old daughter, Genevra. To the surprise of all, rather than offering Kate the position of governess, he offers her marriage! A marriage of convenience, to be sure, but marriage, nonetheless. <br />From such a simple beginning, a wondrous tale is spun. Lord Carismont's home is an ancient castle on a near-island off the coast of Cornwall. During certain tides, it is completely surrounded by water, and it was this vicious tide that took the life of his first wife, Serena, and almost that of their daughter. The ancient legend of Lyonesse is ever present, and when the bells of the sunken city ring, they foretell danger. <br />SECOND THOUGHTS is a wonderful story on every level; the romance is extremely satisfying, the setting is exotic and strangely new, the secondary characters delightful-expecially the children, and the fantasy/paranormal elements completely believable. One could wish only that Ms. Heath might be more prolific-although an easier suggestion is simply to re-read the book again. Immediately. That's the easiest-and quickest-way to double your satisfaction.	2002-07-08

When Dr. MacGregor, a carry-over from Julian Kestrel's first adventure, CUT TO THE QUICK, asks the young London dandy, \\"Look here: are you going to fret yourself into a fever about this business, burn your fingers meddling in what's not your concern, and get yourself and everybody around you into a parcel of trouble?\\" what could the appropriate answer be, but 'Those were more or less my plans.\\" The dryly-spoken words make one want to laugh out loud, regardless of one's surroundings or company.<br />These lines are found on page 79 of A BROKEN VESSEL, by which time Julian is well and truly caught, and not just by the mystery into which he has been thrust; the Cockney 'game gal' who opened the puzzle is the sister of Julian's valet, Dipper. Even though he hasn't seen his sister Sally in over two years, the relationship picks up with no hindrance. Not so that of Sally and Kestrel. Drawn to her in spite of himself, he withdraws, not wishing to upset Dipper. As he withdraws, Sally becomes ever more determined to discover whether her \\"Lightning', as she calls Kestrel, has any flesh and blood beneath his elegant exterior.<br />Sally always indulges herself in two seemingly harmless habits with any cove who engages her; she attaches a name, and she steals some small item, while the cove is otherwise occupied.  During one memorable night, she consorts with \\"Bristles', \\"Blue-Eyes' and \\"Blinkers\\"; a handkerchief is the 'prize' she draws from each of them. Only later does she discover a letter that had been wrapped in one of the cloths. The problem is, which one? It is while she is recovering from the beating administered by Blinkers that she discovers both her brother and the letter.  Dipper senses a need to involve his master, because the letter was obviously written by a rather distraught lady of rank, who is being kept against her will in an unnamed place. Who and where and why engage the attentions of this unlikely trio of detectives.<br />In an entirely logical progression of clues and identifications, Ms. Ross spins well her web, entangling us as certainly as Kestrel is entangled by Sally. Without modern criminology techniques available, Kestrel identifies the various players, including the anonymous lady, and the involved practices of the underworld which put her in a Reclamation Home for Fallen Women.<br />The pathway includes trips to the stews of London as well as a short jaunt to Wiltshire to return an eleven-year-old girl to her parents. The girl under the guise of being trained as a dressmaker's assistant, has instead been allowed to go to London as a potential child prostitute. Her path crosses that of Kestrel, who utilizes her coherent story to bring down one such purveyor of these goods.<br />During his absence from London, Sally becomes impatient, and decides to take things into her own hands, involving all three of the men from who she stole the handkerchiefs in a purported blackmail scheme. Kestrel and Dipper return, but not in time to save the life of a woman who has been haunting one of the three men, and who turns out to be the Scottish wife of Blue-Eyes.  Bristles and 'Blinkers share another secret, one which neatly ties up all the loose ends in a satisfying trial before the magistrate, Sir Richard Birnie.<br />As before, the sights and sounds of 1824 London are brought to vivid life by the perfect usage of the language of the time.  Kestrel, MacGregor, Dipper and Sally will surely be back.  The next great mystery is \\"When, please?\\"	2002-06-19

I do wish I could give this book 4½ stars, which is what it really deserves. 4 just isn't enough, but 5 is a tad too much. I'd settle for 4¾, even, but since I can't do that, then it'll have to be just plain 4 with a star attached or something. <br />The first 260 pages of this 322 page story were enthralling. Ms. Rizzolo has really done her homework, and captured the Regency era wonderfully well. The characters are believable and match the general excellence of the plot. So, what's my quibble, you ask? <br />The two incidents delineated in pages 260 to 268 are a gimmick, I think. Or at least a let-down compared to the general high quality of the rest of the book. Perhaps the author needed help in getting the resolution of the mystery to her main characters, but to me, having them dream the results nearly simultaneously just didn't quite get it. I felt somewhat cheated. But then, after that lapse, she picks up again, and continues forward in a hair-raising sort of chase scene and damsel-in-distress conclusion that make wonderful sense, and demonstrate very well her considerable writing skills. <br />It does seem rather strange to have one heroine and two heroes, but at least they're consistent to their era and themselves. Mrs. Penelope Wolfe is estranged from her painter husband, and cares for their three-year-old daughter on her own. Intelligent, educated, curious--she's a wonderful foil for the quiet, somewhat enigmatic young Barrister, Edward Buckler. Behind the both of them is the Bow Street Runner, John Chase, who sees beyond the normal range of human failings to get to the bottom of the various crimes he encounters in London. <br />The crime in this first book of a welcome new series is the murder of Constance Tyrone, a young woman of good family, somewhat wealthy in her own right, fiercely independent and the founder of the St. Catherine Society, dedicated to helping women who would otherwise fall afoul of the law and/or society. Why was this young woman killed outside her office? When was she killed? These questions are almost more important to Chase than the identity of the one who did it. Eventually, however, he gets it all right, even if the solution did come to him in a dream. <br />Atmospheric in setting, meticulous in detail, I would happily recommend this book to any reader who enjoys history or mystery or historical mysteries. Excellent reading on all counts!	2002-06-08

Sir Drogo de Toulon was one of the invader William's mighty war machines. Eada of Pevensey was a young Saxon woman who had been widowed on her wedding night, leaving her still a maiden.<br />Drogo has fought for William in the hope of gaining lands and wealth, yet when it is offered, he discovers that without Eada as part of the package, there is no worth in it. Eada has inherited from the village witch-woman the ability of hearing and seeing portents of the future. The last prediction made by Old Edith before her death was that Eada's 'mate' would be among the invading Normans. Mayhap there will be even more.<br />Set against the brutal battles and invasion of the Conquest, the characters in this wonderful book will stay in your heart for a long time. The secondary characters are no less pervasive; you'll especially be enamored of Ivo and May, another Norman/Saxon pair who turn Drogo's war camp into a traveling orphanage. Even though they acquire fourteen kids of various ages, along the way into London, neither of them speak the other's language!<BR> <BR>Sensibility, humor, sensuality, panorama, plot, intelligence, romance.

If there were a contest for a favorite character in fiction, an early nomination for me would be that of Aunt Rosemarie Longstreet in this delightful and delightfully different book.<br />This woman defines the word 'contrary' far better than any dictionary I've ever seen. She is like quicksilver in her changeability, providing chuckles and guffaws galore, frequently both within the same paragraph. Absolutely entrancing. <br />Aunt Rosemarie (now in her 60s or thereabouts) in unmarried, and has been a dutiful daughter to her now-deceased father, and a grudgingly dutiful aunt to the daughter of her only sister, Helen 'Nell' Armstrong. A roof over her head, food and clothing--these have been provided for Nell, but nothing else that might come from the normal loving family relationship. In turn, Nell has made a death-bed promise to her grandfather that she will always stay with her aunt, and care for her. <br />After ten years of staying entirely put at their country home, Longstreet Manor, Aunt has suddenly decided to venture to Bath, supposedly to take the waters for her gout. The gout is real, but little else appears to be. Their very first appearance proves enlightening for Nell, when Aunt's godson, Sir Hugh Nowlin, makes himself known to the ladies at the circulating library.  This name was a familiar one to Nell, as Sir Hugh was Aunt's heir, but until now she'd never seen the young man. <br />From this point onward, the stay in Bath takes on new dimensions, as Nell meets an assortment of people; some previously known to her aunt, and some not. Through it all, Nell maintains her composure, never aspiring to more than she thinks eligible for her position. She is a most delightful heroine, and Hugh is every bit her equal. Together, they're formidable in searching out the deeply-buried secrets of Aunt Longstreet. <br />This book is a bit out of the traditional mold, which endeared it to me, as I cherish plot and good writing more than the romantic elements. A reader with different expectations may quibble, but it's still one very delightful book!	2002-03-27

I'm automatically predisposed to like any book set on Mackinac Island. (After all, my own two were set there, although at least one hundred fifty years earlier than this one.) But when I started reading Death is a Cabaret, I didn't know a good portion of it would take place at that grand Grand Hotel. <br />The book--plot, characters, writing, everything--is entirely worthy of that dignified and unique setting. It's just simply marvelous. And, if I didn't know better, I'd swear the author had been in my car listening as my daughter explained about Michigan's picturesque license plates. <br />Of course, I also like stories set during the days of Napoleon and Josephine, too, and although this is a modern story, the love of Napoleon for his Josephine plays a major part in the plot. Finally, one more caveat--I love reading books which allow the reader to learn about new things, if the reader is so inclined. This book is brimming over with love-and lore--of the world of antiques, as well as antique collectors. <br />Jeff Talbot, now in his mid-thirties, had spent his early working years with the FBI, but a lack of action sent him on his way to a new career--becoming a very good antique 'picker'. He's inherited a wonderful old house in Seattle, providing him with a suitable place to keep all his own treasures, plus affording him the background he needs in his new world. He's married to Sheila, one of the more intriguing characters I've ever encountered in the world of fiction, who is certainly a more than able side-kick.<br />One of Jeff's best customers is the 70-something Blanche Appleby, who, more than almost anything in the world, wishes to reclaim an antique tea set that had been sold out from under her, some fifty years earlier. Of course, it isn't just any old tea set. No, this one had been commissioned by Napoleon for Josephine, and differed from most of the examples of that period in having two cups and saucers rather than just one. This madeit a 'cabaret' rather than a 'solitaire' or 'déjeuner'. Replete with swans (for Josephine)and bees (for Napoleon) and gilt (for them both) it was a truly fitting example of the art of Sevres, even if only an imaginary creation, especially for this story.<br />The Cabaret is to be the highlight at an auction that will end a weekend antique festival held annually on Mackinac Island. Antique lovers and collectors come from around the world to participate, including two of Jeff's acquaintances from Seattle. When one of them is found murdered, Jeff finds himself helping the very capable Island police force to investigate. Another death follows, opening up more of the past history for many of the participants at the festival.<br />The ending, with the unmasking of the killer was unexpected, and perhaps a tad out of left field, but still satisfactory. Overall, this was a very enjoyable reading experience, and I, for one, eagerly await Jeff's next adventure! And, it is to be hoped, many more after that.	2002-03-14

Even if you don't ordinarily care for cats-in books or out of them-you're sure to adore Ozymandias and Cleopatra, the feline hero and heroine of this scrumptious book. No, they're not the main characters, exactly, but they're certainly very strong protagionists, nonetheless. Of course, there are a human hero and heroine, as well-in fact, two sets, plus the most delicious villain and villainess you'll come across in a great many pages.<br />And, if that's not enough, there's just a hint of magic here and there, interwoven with the exotic ambiance of Ancient Egypt.  Not a time-travel, however, but rather, because of the French military presence in Egypt around 1800, the British were there, also. In fact, the Rosetta stone, which unveiled the ancient Egyptian heiroglyphs, was discovered there in 1798, and brought to England for further scrutiny. <br />Sir Julian Richardson has never married, although he has most certainly loved. Frustrated at not being able to have his adored Felice as his own, he has turned his interest to Egyptology. His two brothers did marry, and each produced one daughter. Amanda is the blonde, beauteous one, whereas Tansy is the loving one. When Tansy's father died rather suddenly, she was sent to Constantinople, where Amanda's father served in the British diplomatic corps. When he was transferred to Australia, it was decided that both girls should return to England, and Hermione Entwhistle, the widow of an English vicar, is engaged as their chaperone. <br />At this point, the troubles begin. Their British ship is attacked and sunk by pirates, and the women are abruptly cast ashore in a hidden and quiet branch of the Nile, where they fear being discovered by the French, who are noisily nearby, industriously preparing to abscond with a vast amount of stolen artifacts. Instead, the ladies are found by Tusun, a Mameluke who is friendly with the British, and who triggers their rescue.<br />Lt. Martin Ballard has been put ashore on a reconaissance mission, and it is his aid that Tusun engages-along with, in the process-the theft of the French ship. Eventually, the humans and the artifacts-and one small tabby cat that Tansy has named Cleopatra-end up on a British ship heading homeward. Because Martin has been shot at and seriously wounded, they determine to put him ashore at Sir Julian's estate, along with the women, rather than risk the longer trip to Portsmouth.  And then the fun begins in earnest! <br />Amanda has been betrothed to the Earl of Sanderby-Randal Fenworth-Felice's son, as it happens, but whose father caused a scandal blackening Sir Julian's name among the scientific and historical societies of London.  There is a secret in Randal's past, and fearing its discovery, he selected Amanda as his future bride because of her wealth. These two really deserve each other, for a shallower pair you'll never find anywhere. <br />At about this point-while Martin is recuperating, and Amanda is busily trying to sneak out to see Randal-Ozymandias and Cleopatra decide to lend a helping paw, and they are simply amazing at it! Laughs are guaranteed by their hijinks, as well as those of the humans of course. It all works itself out nicely by the end, when each characters gets his or her just rewards. This is a marvelously inventive story that could only have happened where and when the author said it did. Read it for yourself. I'm sure you'll agree.	2002-02-27

Henry Morton, a tall, lean and darkly handsome sprig of the nobility from the wrong side of the blanket, has nevertheless benefited from his patrimony by being educated, at least so far as one year at university. But it is from his mother that he received the heritage that was to stand him in best stead in his career as a Runner. This was an incredible memory, coupled with a massive helping of common sense. <br />Some years prior to the opening of this 'memoir', Henry met and was taken under the wing of the formidable John Townsend, originator of the Bow Street Runners. He is considered by most of his fellows to be of strong moral character, as well as clever. His actress lady-friend, Mrs. Arabella Malibrant, is also friendly with Arthur Darley, (younger son of the Earl of Cardiff) and it is at his home in Portman Square that the story begins to unfold. <br />Young Halbert Glendinning arrives at Darley's home in a hackney coach, but is unable to remove himself from it to go into the house, as he is unconscious. Arabella is there, too, and immediately sends off for Henry to join them as quickly as possible. Also present is Louisa Hamilton, Halbert's fiancée. Coincidentally, there is also present a physician, who, after a somewhat cursory examination, declares the man to have died from 'natural causes'. Henry disagrees, and unknowingly sets in motion the various plots in this tangled web of deceit that will take him from rural Sussex, to the seamy flash house, 'The Otter' in Spitalfields, and even to his own appearance in the dock before his sometime employer, Chief Magistrate Sir Nathaniel Conant.  <br />Fortunate for the reader, (not to mention Henry!) the nanny-house (home of child prostitutes) is where the young and exceedingly precocious Lucy is to be found. What a treasure she is! <br />Cleverly plotted, wonderfully well written, with engaging characters (about whom we'll want to know more, please) the resolution arrives in a totally believable way. But yet, itdoes impart a slightly incomplete feeling as the reader turns the final page, and closes the book. Anyone who reads and enjoys this book will absolutely want to read more about these very human, very real people. <br />The story is as well blended together as the threads of any tapestry-a wonderful mixture of the many disparate elements of London's Regency world: high society co-existing with the underbelly in the sad parts of the great city, Wellington's victory at Waterloo, the Elgin marbles, Lord Byron and his poetry. Absolutely first rate!	2002-02-26

Until someone steals a car and runs down an inebriated bridesmaid, that is. From that point on, it seems as though nothing wants to go right, and no one is who they appear to be. <br />Her friend Nicolle Parry just wants to marry Ray Ishigura , the up-and-coming concert pianist. And, for a change, money is no object, Nickie's father being Douglas Parry, <BR>chairman of the board of King County Savings. So why do all these unsettling things keep happening? Well, for one thing, there is a battle between the former CEO of the bank, Keith Guthridge. Did he or didn't he twiddle the funds? <br />Aaron Gold, a reporter who has a nose for gossip as well as news, seems to always pop up just when he shouldn't. It's fairly obvious he has his eye on Carnegie, but from her six-foot vantage point, his five-foot-eight or so is little more than a pest. Especially when the more than six-foot Holt Walker is on the scene, as well. <br />In order to keep Parry from testifying at the upcoming trial, threats have been made, but when they don't seem to have the desired effect, Nickie is kidnapped. Carnegie finds herself smack in the middle of everything, mostly against her will, but she finds inner resources she didn't know she had.  She hangs on by her fingernails and prevails against the bad guys to rescue Nickie and herself, and Aaron. <br />This is not exactly your everyday cozy mystery, but I truly enjoyed it, hanging on every last word!  I'm eagerly awaiting the next wedding in the series. For a first book, this one was unusually well done. Enjoy! Unless, of course, you're planning a wedding . . .	2002-02-22

I first became acquainted with the novels of Michael Jecks a bit more than a year ago, when an unknown-to-me resident of my community gave a book to our library that she had bought in England, read on the plane coming home and decided to let others share her enjoyment. That book was 'Squire Throwleigh's Heir'.  What a treat! And what a good idea, too, as the library is now ordering the books directly, instead of relying on gifts. <br />Even though I've now read two of the books out of sequence, I don't think that's a problem, although certainly I'll have to read more to find out how Simon and Baldwin got together in the first place. Michael Jecks is one terrific storyteller, in my opinion. He makes the characters as well as the time in which they live come alive, in ways that other novels seem to miss. And, from reading reviews of some of his other books here, perhaps sometimes his research is not 100% accurate, I really don't know, not having lived during the time being written about. I do know, however, that if I really wanted to learn more history, I wouldn't choose fiction as the means of doing so. <br />I've read enough of the medieval period, however, to believe that Mr. Jecks has done more than a little homework. I believe his version of the 1300s is more realistic--noisier, dirtier and less nice than that of many another author. On the other hand, his way with dialogue is masterful, and he chooses to forward his story by using that device more often than not. <br />In this episode, a troup of mercenaries--hard, coarsened men of war--stop to rest in the small town of Crediton, not far from Exeter, and before anyone has time to do much more than blink, two women of the town are found dead. A robbery occurs, and as it happens, the Keeper of the King's Peace, Baldwin Furnshill along with his friend, Simon Puttock, bailiff of Lydford Castle are visiting the local priest to celebrate a visit by the bishop. <br />Simon and his wife Marguerite have recently lost their toddler son to a childhood illness and have not yet been able to reconcile this loss to or with each other. This leaves Simon to spend perhaps more time than usual with Baldwin and his investigations. Initially, it certainly does appear that the culprit is a young recruit named Cole, but if he really did steal the plate from the mercenary captain, Sir Hector, what did he do with it all before he got conked on the head? <br />Baldwin methodically and carefully investigates all the possibilities before yet another body is discovered. With none of the modern detection methods available, Baldwin and Simon use their wits and various skills to eliminate the impossibilities and find the improbable culprit.  A very satisfying and enjoyable book!	2002-02-22

I haven't been to Baltimore in years, but this book made me feel right at home, almost as though I could easily find my way around with no touristy troubles. I might not even mind a tour guide, if I could get one like Hitchcock Sewell. We just would not--probably--meet at his work. <br />Hitch, you see, is the very handsome son of a very handsome couple who were early TV stars in Baltimore, and were struck down in their prime. Hitch was a mere twelve at the time. Fortunately, he had an Aunt Billie and Uncle Stu who took him in, and raised him as their son. Thus, Sewell and Sons Family Funeral Home. Uncle Stu has gone on to his reward, leaving only Hitch and Aunt Billie to carry on. So--carry on, they do.<br />It was during the funeral of a retired firefighter than a very attractive and young woman came in to inquire about a funeral service. For herself. Well, not really. Because when the corpse of that name did arrive a couple of days later, she did not resemble the former young lady in any way at all. This set Hitch's curiosity bump to working overtime, and before he quite realized what was happening, he was deep in the middle of a local scandalous mystery. <br />Still good friends with his former wife, Julia, they see each other rather often at rehearsals for the Gypsy Players up-coming production of OUR TOWN. Sparks usually still fly between them, too, but at the moment Julia is completely taken up with her next candidate for the position of husband-Peter Morgan, who has a twin sister, Amanda. Amanda is the wife of Allen Stuart, the front-running candidate to become the next governor. Hitch is connected here, too, as a former college pal of Joel Hutchinson, who just happens to be campaign manager for Allen Stuart. <br />Are you confused yet? Well, let's see. I could mention Kate Zabriskie, the widowed young police officer who was married to another police officer, who got in front of a stray bullet during a stake-out. But really, I highly recommend that you readthe book. Tim Cockey tells the story much better than I ever could. He should. After all, he wrote it!	2002-02-22

Certain things are always the same: excellent crisp writing, unique plot, characters with whom a reader can identify instantly, and settings that enhance the entire story. Some times one finds things that indicate the era in which the book was written, but not often. One thing you'll never find in a book by this author is same old, same old. <br />She has a knack of creating an entity that is whole and complete and not one part of it may be changed in any way without entirely deflating it. Her books can only take place in the location and era in which they are set, with no possibility of change, lest one completely destroy the aggregate. <br />Such is the case with Rakehell's widow. It could not possibly be placed anywhere other than London, in the early 1800s. Dueling had not yet become illegal, or if it had, the law was not enforced, and Alabeth Manvers became a widow at a very young age when her rakehell husband Lord Robert, fell on the field of honor. There wasn't very much honor involved, actually, but Robert's friend and second, Sir Piers Castleton, conspired to keep her from learning the truth about her husband's activities. <br />Having displeased her father by her marriage, the widowed Lady Alabeth is startled by a visit from the Earl of Wallborough. A member of the diplomatic corps, he is about to leave England for the continent, and needs Alabeth to sponsor his younger daughter--her sister, Jillian--for her London come-out, and it must be this year. Against her better judgement, Alabeth lets herself be talked into a task she knows will create nothing but trouble. <br />Of course, one of the very first men she encounters is Sir Piers Castleton. Try as she will, she cannot escape his constant presence at every event she attends. To add to her dismay, Jillian appears smitten with the gentleman, and scorns the man who idolizes her--Charles Allister, a childhood friend. But then, the Polish Count Adam Zaleski appears on the scene, and he is more dangerous than anyone could have predicted. He is a virtual twin to Robert Manvers, as well as a foremost concert pianist, who is lionized by everyone who attends his concerts. Jillian wishes for nothing more than to study with this wizard of the keyboard, but the Count is more intrigued with Alabeth. For a time, she falls under his spell, until finally, the veil is lifted, and all the characters are shown as they truly are. <br />Each of the sisters ends up with the proper gentleman, but it's rather a near thing. It's very obvious that the author did her homework regarding the musical elements; she never puts a finger wrong on the keyboard. Either of them, for that matter.	2002-02-18

The Duke and the dressmaker -- once over that particular hurdle, however, nothing else in this delightful book is at all routine or hum-drum. It's a perfect Christmas present, with its cleverly woven tale of hidden treasures, and plum everythings! <br />Jane Nichol runs away from the horrendous match proposed by her step-mother, but is much better prepared for survival than most females of the age would have been. Due to the efforts of her beloved governess, Miss Godwin,  Jane is proficient in both French and sewing. What more natural then, to establish herself--in heavy disguise--as Madame Nicolette, seamstress? In Bath, no less, a pleasant change from the busy London of 1819. <br />Madame's fashions quickly become essential to Fanny Fowler, who has become betrothed to the Duke of Chandrose, and engaged the young dressmaker to produce a wondrous wardrobe in celebration. Except that, when the marriage is called off, Fanny's father refuses to pay, leaving Jane with gorgeous clothing, and monstrous bills. <br />Greatly daring, Jane decides to broach the young Duke for payment, to keep herself away from financial ruin. Not surprisingly, after initially refusing to consider such reimbursements, he changes his mind, and begins to pursue the dressmaker, for a multitude of reasons. Eventually, all ends up as it should, leaving everyone--reader and characters alike--satisfied.  <br />I think, however, the readers get much the better of this arrangement. Elisabeth Fairchild has a wondrous way with words, and each of the silver sugarplum surprises with which she decorates this confection will create a smile. A book to be savored, year after year.	2002-02-17

Anyone who thinks coincidence has no place in fiction has obviously not read the books of Ellen Hart. She uses coincidence to trigger the plot in several of her books, but none better than the totally believable set-up here. <br />Sophie Greenaway is now, in addition to general manager and owner of the Maxfield Plaza Hotel in Minneapolis, the restaurant reviewer for the Star-Tribune. Her immediate supervisor, the food editor, Berniece Washburn, is also a friend. When Berniece needs to go home to Rose Hill to visit her father, ill in the hospital from a severe stroke, Sophie offers to drive. A sudden summer storm results in her having to stay the night in the home of  Berniece's parents. There, Sophie stumbles over a photo of a young couple, dating from years earlier. Obviously, the photo is of Berniece's parents, but-wait! Sophie recognizes the man from her own youth, and his name then was not John Washburn. <br />From this ordinary beginning, a tale of multiple lies begins and takes over the waking hours of Sophie and her son, Rudy.  Not to mention several of the inhabitants of Rose Hill, and other towns scattered through the upper Great Lakes area. Throughout is the back story of the newspaper's contest for the best meatloaf recipe--the top three are included in the book, and look delicious!<br />Unfortunately, the ending of the book and solution of the mystery, while tying up all the loose ends, etc., seems awfully rushed. The epilogue almost doesn't even belong to this book, it's so 'out-of-left-field' in content. And that's the only reason for the four star rating, as this author is usually 5 stars, just like the very best restaurants!	2002-02-14

The reviews of this book led me to try it. And after having read it in its entirety, I think it most resembles a book written by a committee. Each individual member has his or her own plan for what's going to happen, and adheres to that regardless of what came before or after their section. Consequently, the book isn't quite sure of what it really wants to be. <BR>                   <BR>There are humorous parts, to be sure, and others that are so dry, they read like a catalog. Also, at times, I felt that the author went a tad overboard using caricature as a means of describing characters. They're almost too buffoonish to be real. And of all things, I tumbled to the 'whodunit' almost immediately, which was a major surprise, as I almost never figure it out before the author tells us who's the bad guy. Or gal.<br />On the other hand, the small-town ambience of Scumble River seems absolutely right, as well as the Chokeberry Days Festival that happens every year with its carnival, and cooking contests. If you've ever been to such a small town festival, it will seem exactly right to you.  <br />Will I try the next book in the series? Probably. At least, one more.	2002-02-14

If you want some really fascinating reading, just look up all the books by Judith A. Lansdowne and read the reviews! My word. All over the map, they are. It's not at all uncommon to find 5 reviews, with each one having a different rating. Obviously, many readers will come to the same book, but with varying expectations. <br />This may not be quite the best Lansdowne book I've read, but it is still so much better than entirely too many of the other so-called Regency novels being published. The research is always impeccable; you'll never find the hero or heroine thinking like folks who really live in 2001 and are merely costumed for the sake of the book. Her plots are sometimes a tad 'out-there' but never so far as to be impossible. <br />To me, her greatest strength is her characterization. Every person in her books-toddler to grand-parent-is real with the normal ambiguities that inhabit normal people. They may occasionally say or do silly things, but don't we all? And no one I've ever read does animals any better, whether cat, dog, horse, parrot or any other species. She is a wonderful writer who is gifted with a 'humor bump' that translates to the written word with great ease. If you need to laugh, you can do no better for yourself than to read a Lansdowne book. <br />All that said, MY FAIR QUIGGLEY was very solid entertainment and enjoyment for me. Dax and Dessie were well-matched to each other, and I'm really looking forward to the Miranda/Dan adventure, as I'm sure that's just what it'll be. The only let-down for me in this story was the somewhat sudden and almost improbable rehabilitation of Lord Hartshorn. Not unbelievable, by any means, just a bit too rushed to be entirely accepted on such short notice.	2002-01-29

If you're a steady reader of Regency novels, and wonder about all the autocratic dukes above ground during those days, this well-done and very witty book will provide a delightful respite. The author gives us a wonderful hero, who will out-duke any duke you've ever read about.<br />Simon Alexander Derain Winters, Earl of St. Albans, Baron Winters, etc., etc., is totally unaccustomed to taking orders from anyone-even his King or the Regent. And the sooner his Gypsy gets that simple fact into her head, the happier everyone will be. Except that Glynis Chatwin, in spite of being found in the earl's bed-with neither of them very well dressed, in the bargain-will be no man's servant. <br />She is on a quest-to establish the truth of her Gypsy mother's claim of marriage to a titled man-such proof needed to end, forever, the question of legitimacy for her and her younger brother, Christopher. The current peer, Francis Dawes, Lord Nevin, would much rather see the young woman hanged as a thief. From this rather unconventional beginning, a wonderful tale emerges. <br />Their mutual desires bring Simon and Glynis (and Christopher) together in their search for the proof Glynis seeks. Simon will lend his not inconsiderable resources if she will only masquerade as his mistress. The battle of wills this engenders is very much a taming of the shrew, if only one could be sure of just who is the real shrew! <br />The plot, which contains as much mystery as it does romance is engrossing, and you'll find yourself rooting for the satisfactory outcome that finally emerges, along with the romance. Both Glynis and Simon find themselves in strange situations, wondering how their original paths could have ended them up in such different locations, both physically and emotionally. <br />Although the author states that this was to be the end of her 'Compromised' series, the new Lord Nevin is whispering otherwise. Good for him! More happy reading in store for the rest of us.	2002-01-29

First of all, thank you to Berkley/Jove for continuing to release the wonderful, older books by Elizabeth Mansfield, as well as bringing out the occasional new one.  This book dates to May, 1980 in its original version, but it is still a delight to read. The authors tell-tale skill with witty dialogue is present in abundance in this tale of a spirited young woman and the quiet young man she encounters. Each encounter is more hilarious than the last, as Sophie Edgerton creates disturbances without even trying. Of course, when she does try-sparks fly all over the place. <br />Unable to live with her father and step-mother, Sophie has come to live with her widowed grandmother, Lady Alicia, in London. But Sophie's escapades begin to wear thin when she enthusiastically greets a gentleman at a ball. Truly, she thought she was greeting her cousin Bertie, who has just returned from several years away. Unfortunately, she guessed wrong, and the unsuspecting gentleman who received the hugs was the retiring Earl of Wynwood, Marcus Harvey. <br />As is usually the case, after this first meeting, subsequent ones also tend toward disaster, leaving Sophie determined to take a repairing lease to the country, even if it has to be at her own home. But then Lady Alicia shows the girl an invitation she's just received. It's for a two-week house party, from Lady Alicia's dearest friend. Not until later does Sophie discover that the dearest friend is also the Mama of Marcus. <br />Unsettled by the growing attraction Sophie feels towards Marcus, she still also has the inclination for mischief, especially when Marcus announces his engagement to the eminently suitable Miss Iris Bethune.  Unable to appreciate the impending marriage, Sophie runs away to her father's house, and the religious step-mother.  <br />Rescued by Marcus, who neglects to tell her that his betrothal has been called off by Iris, Sophie is distant and cold to him, causing more misunderstandings. Eventually, however, all things turnabout, and the resulting Regency Match is more satisfying than most.  Great fun!	2002-01-29

As with the liquid variety of spirits, some being more potent than others, this book will leave the reader in varying degress of tipsiness, depending on the most recently-read story. <br />Five highly-acclaimed Regency authors are represented here, with their stories featured in alphabetical order by the authors last name, with that of Nancy Butler taking pride of place as first and best in this edition-in this reader's opinion. Other contributors are Emma Jensen, Edith Layton, Barbara Metzger and Andrea Pickens. <br />THE MERRY WANDERER from Nancy Butler is fantasy at its very best for the season of wishes and dreams. Robin Goodfellow is not exactly what he appears to be when he presents himself at Arden House, the home of Julia, Lady of Islay. Nearing the end of her year of mourning, Julia is now facing the possible loss of her home and her younger brother, when the charming stranger intrudes into her very life. He does seem to be a bit strange, but then, so was her father. And so, yet, is her cousin, who is the threat to her happiness. After a bit of determination, and some help from friendly spirits, Robin finds himself forced to choose between his former legendary life-style, and a new, more mortal one. With help from Julia-and her younger brother, Harry-he makes the right, the only choice possible, bringing a Merry Yuletide to all.<br />'Tis no secret that Emma Jensen has a huge soft spot for Ireland, and she exploits this for all it's worth in the delightful tale extolling THE WEXFORD CAROL. Hollymore, the ancient and exceedingly dilapidated home of Elizabeth Fitzhollis is also in jeopardy. This time, however, it's more easily understood. Hollymore is falling apart around her very ears, and has been sold by the new heir to a Duke from Wales, who plans to tear it down and build a hunting estate. The Duke sends his cousin, a Captain Jones, to survey and inspect. Or so Elizabeth is told by her ancient solicitor. Turns out the gentleman is really Captain Lord Rhys Edward-Jones, and he's no more impervious to the ghosts of Hollymore than is Elizabeth. <br />Edith Layton's story-telling with its wicked sense of humor and wordplay propelled her to the top of my list of favorites, and has kept her very near the top for all these many years. HIGH SPIRITS is a different sort of story; heart-warming, to be sure, because it does, after all, have a happy ending. Layton of whatever vintage is excellent, and many readers will find a extra message in this tale of young Arabella, her silver flask and the tall, dark and handsome Rupert.<br />THE CHRISTMAS CURSE by Barbara Metzger is a romp, plain and simple. Well, not so plain and not so simple, really. It is the strangest mixture of bawdy and sweet. And the spirits?  Not your ordinary selection, to be sure, as Sir Olnic and his Lady Edryth are the very restless, unhappy 'spirited' inhabitants of  Worth Keep, doomed to wander the halls endlessly, until the curse muttered by the Lady be lifted. This is not an easy trick, either, and so far, it's been some four to five hundred years of struggle. Sir Olnic merely asked his lady for a favor when entering a joust one Christmas Day, but she was unhappy with him, and uttered the fateful words that began 'if you lose this ring...' As of course he did, having lost his life-as did his opponent-and his finger, and the ring. It must be reinstated on the finger of the heir's true love, during the twelve days of Christmas or they'll continue to be restless. The current heir, Oliver Nicholson, Baron Worth, is another battle-scarred veteran, convinced he'll never marry, until he meets the lovely widow, Amelia Merriot and her little dog, Sir Digby. In almost any book by Metzger, it's the dog who saves the day, and this one is no exception. <br />In A GATHERING OF GIFTS by Andrea Pickens, Lady Emma Pierson, daughter of the Duke of Telford, is by way of becoming a very spoiled and head-strong young woman. Her cousin, Charles, Viscount Lawrence, is very vexed with her, and to spite him, she rides off in the opposite direction and promptly takes a frightful spill on the icy field. Her new neighbor, Noel Trumbull, insists she be taken to his nearby home, Hawthorne House, for recuperation. His widowed sister Anna and her small son Toby are about to arrive for a visit, and he insists that they not be inconvenienced by the thoughtless young lady and her friends. To the surprise of everyone, both Emma and Charles find much common ground, and help each other heal their wounds, in time to celebrate the most wonderful Holiday on the calendar. <br />All in all, this volume is a grand continuation of this long-running series of Christmas anthologies, one you'll remember with fondness for many years to come.	2002-01-29

At 500 larger-than-normal-paperback-sized pages, it's more than a handful, believe me! So far I've only read the first 11 of 22 stories, because after a bit, they're too much of a muchness. I learned too late that this book is not exactly meant for reading the stories within from start to finish, more or less in consecutive order, and uninterrupted by other reading in between. Consequently, I found the stories beginning to mesh together rather a bit too much, and felt it unfair to continue reading just now. <br />As a rule, stories in an anthology of this kind are arranged by location of story, or time-frame. The latter is the approach here, and that's fine. It's a perfectly valid method. However, considering that the 22 stories begin in ancient Rome and continue only until the very early 1600s, there is bound to be some overlapping of settings. The first five stories, for instance, all share the Roman setting. Then there are the dark ages, and a raft of early Medieval, up to about 1250 or so.<br />I found them all to be enjoyable, although some more so than others, and will certainly be looking for books by many of these authors, who impressed me with their plotting and characters, not to mention the obvious and extensive historical research. The two authors with whom I'm most familiar-Margaret Frazer and Michael Jecks-appear in the second half of the book. A treat for next time!	2002-01-29

But don't let that keep you from reading it. Just when you think the author is liable to go a bit overboard in one direction, she pulls back nicely, and heads in another. <br />There's a mystery, to be sure, and romance and reincarnation and psychic phenomena and lots of humor. All in all, an enjoyable mixture. One might wish for a bit more about the writing careers of the 'ghosts' but that's a feeble complaint, really. <br />Jake O'Hara earns her living as a ghostwriter, and even belongs to Ghostwriters Anonymous. At 34, she lives with her widowed mom, Maura, and stumbles into mysteries wherever she goes. This time, however, it's Mom who witnesses the murder of a priest as she's about to begin her confession. From there, the story proceeds from Manhattan to Washington, DC, to Long Island and back to Manhattan again. <br />Her companions, ghostly and otherwise are all here: Gypsy Rose Liebowitz, Dennis Kim (and his Dad), Ben Rubin (and *his* Dad) and ghosts Modesty, Jane and Too-Tall Tim. <br />The mystery really centers around a 34-year-old murder victim, whose death on the day Jake was born leads to the reincarnation bits, but in a sensible way. I think more people experience this kind of experience than are willing to say. I know I have. <br />In the end, however, justice is served, and all the loose ends are neatly tied up, waiting for the next ghostly enterprise. Should be fun!	2002-01-25

The problem with lumping all novels of a certain type into one conveniently labeled bin--Regency Romance, for instance--is that some novels have more to the plot than just the romance. If, like me, your preferences lean toward that sort of book, you'll probably find yourself liking those books that other readers sometimes do not, because of the lack of extreme sexual tension or love play on every page. <br />A terrific example of this plot-heavier book is 'The Sinister Spinster' by Carolyn Madison, a positively wonderful writer, no matter what name is on the cover as author. I've always found her research to be thorough and dependable, and I've especially liked her books with espionage as a major plot line. This reasonably new volume in the 'Spinster' series carries over at least a mention of some of the previous spinsters and the husbands they captured, along with introducing us to new ones of similar type.<br />Make no mistake. These 'Spinsters' are not your typical Regency misses, believe me! These ladies are well-educated, well-traveled, and in spite of their acquaintance with the 'ton' and all it's activities, are nobody's ninnies. Far from it. <br />A lady's companion is supposed to be seldom seen and never heard from, while running never-ceasing errands, whether real or conjured up to create busywork. Elizabeth Mattingale finds herself in this uncomfortable position, which she approaches as a trial effort. If she can successfully weather six months of Lady Derring, she'll then feel more willing to let her Grandmother find her a more demanding position. She's not sure what that might be, but it will certainly be more intellectually challenging than this one is. <br />Until, of course, Adam Darrach, Marquess of  Falconer, arrives on the scene. As a member of the diplomatic corps, he's been assigned to secure the help of Lord Derring in catching a spy. He'll soon have his hands full, what with the youthful, gorgeous and very available Dowager Duchess of Barrington. Then there's Prince Alexi, known to be a confidante of the Grand Duchess, who is really the power behind the Russian throne, in spite of her brother, the Tsar, believing that he's the ruler. Adam is even more confused when Alexi and Elizabeth seem to be very old and very good friends. <br />Add in your usual mix of house party guests--not least the group of twenty-something young men, who think that serving women are all fair game--the close-to-the-sea location, making smuggling a more effective means of communication than the postal service, and you have most of the ingredients handy for a sometimes comic, sometimes  tragic houseparty, complete with assignations by moonlight, stolen papers, and a mad dash after the escaping carriage, sure to contain the wanted spy! <br />The variety of tensions will keep you turning the pages with increasing enjoyment, as Adam and Elizabeth each achieve their own goals. Now, for Elinore's book! After all, even if she is a Duke's daughter, she's still a spinster!	2001-11-21

This is one scary book. <br />If you have any intention of flying anywhere in the next few years, you owe it to yourself to read this book first. It won't increase your comfort level at all, but it will leave you with a sense of being forewarned, just in case . . .  I wouldn't recommend reading it just before bedtime, however, as it might prompt unhappy dreams. <br />As an American, I found the most astonishing discovery of this book to be that air rage is not an American monopoly. We may have invented this malaise, but we are by no means the only perpetrators. It's little comfort that none of the other countries seem to have a handle on the situation, either. The skies are not only becoming more crowded, they're also becoming downright unfriendly. <br />The authors have clearly done their homework, and the research is very evident. The facts are lavishly interspersed with anecdotes. Something must be done, and be done quickly to prevent future episodes of air rage and/or air terrorism. As well as illuminating the problems connected with this fairly recent development, the authors also outline several possible remedies, which, if enacted on a global basis, could do much to make the skies at least reasonably safe once again. <br />Just as the appearance of Sky Marshals and global penalties for hijacking helped to reduce that threat, a good case is made for such actions to reduce this new one. People everywhere have to realize that the day of the 'cheap' flight to anywhere may well be in the past; added costs to implement these safety measures should be shared by passengers and airlines alike. Their concerns are mutually shared regardless of the nationalities involved. Tough laws need to be implemented by every country and rigidly enforced with serious penalties for infringement: penalties that are not eligible for appeal or compromise. Perpetrators are not the victims here, after all; we, the passengers are. Until this fact is recognized and dealt with universally, we're all at risk whenever we decide to board an airplane. <br />Approximately one-third of the book is in the Appendix category, and should not be ignored by the reader. It's really too bad, however, that such rules and laws have to be in legalese rather than ordinary language. Unless one is an attorney, many of these pages may be at least partly incomprehensible, even to the frequent flier.  <br />As a not-so-frequent flier, I'm not convinced that deregulation was such a good thing for the passengers of the airlines who were given a reprieve from standards that made flying an exciting adventure. The authors liken today's coach section to the 'cattle class' or steerage sections of the ocean liners of yesteryear. I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather be on the sea rather than in the air, if one of my fellow passengers went beserk. <br />This book should be required reading for everyone, everywhere--from corporate presidents to air crews to the person who flies--nervously--once every five years. I can't imagine, however, that the airline executives would happily embrace the book. But if they're honest with themselves and their employees and their customers, they'll admire it, regardless of how much they might also loathe it! It is unfortunate that a bit more attention wasn't paid to the editing and proof-reading of this book. But that's a minor quibble, compared to the valuable information imparted in its pages. It's a real eye-opener, believe me.	2001-11-09

It's very true that a less-than-terrific book by Dorothy Gilman is still much more fun to read than an excellent one by a lesser light. This book is so well set-up that I fell head-long under its myriad charms, but kept falling out again for the strangest reasons. That's why the 4 rather than 5 stars. <br />Andrew Thale is sent by his businessman father to western Massachusetts from their home in Manhattan, to inspect a supposedly neglected property that had belonged to Aunt Harriet Thale, who died five years before the opening of this story. An unhappy young man, Andrew has suffered a nervous breakdown after a plane crash, causing him to have a monumental case of writer's block. Even though he's had two well-regarded mystery novels published, he seems unable to write anything at all anymore. Not even interesting tid-bits for the company newsletter, a position handed him by his father. <br />Off Andrew goes in the company Mercedes. Although not all that far away in hours or miles, once he finds the place, it proves to be centuries removed from today's world. For Aunt Harriet was a collector--of people who were down on their luck a bit, or had no other place to go, or were generally looked down on by Society. She assembled a truly great household of delightful eccentrics, and promised them that they could stay there forever. And so they have. <br />Miss L'Hommedieu could have arrived on a &quot;Streetcar Named Desire&quot; embodying as she does the ancient southern belle, wrapped in layers of chiffon, and sporting beautiful old-fashioned hats. She entertains her fellow householders by writing a paragraph of a new story and reading it to them every evening. Problem is, it's a different story every time, and she never continues any of them. She only does beginnings. To digress a moment--what wonderful beginnings they are, too! They almost make one wonder if perhaps Ms. Gilman had resurrected them from her younger days. If so, I do wish she'd finish some of them. They're wonderful! Back to the book . . .<br />Then, there's Gussie, who practices Wicca quite openly, to the general admiration of the nearby townsfolk, as well as her own housemates. Leo is a well-educated and well-read Marxist, who delights in quoting passages from the great philosphers through the ages. This came in handy when Tarragon Sage Valerian--so named by Miss Thale, who claimed that privilege after finding the baby on her doorstep--made her appearance. Tarragon is much loved by all, regardless of her birth, and has been very well-educated in her home school, organized by Leo. <br />But the house--Thale's Folly--well, the money left by Miss Thale dwindled, and the electricity was turned off. Followed, of course, shortly thereafter by the water. Fortunately, there is a creek and a pond on the twenty-five acres around the house, and some of those acres are put to good use as vegetable and herb gardens. The little band survives, in spite of themselves. <br />This is the situation when Andrew arrives; he's totally confounded by everything. Doing all the wrong things first, however, he is their inadvertent saviour. When his room is ransacked, he stumbles over the missing will while searching for something to read. He then discovers his long-lost Mother living most happily in a cabin on the other side of the pond. <br />All too soon, the gypsies have arrived, and Andrew has miraculously found his next book in a trunk in Miss L'Hommedieu's room. All the loose ends are neatly tied up in the last ten pages. Therein lies my major complaint. It's TOO rushed! There are just too many loose ends still dangling when one turns the final page. More! I want more! Please!<br />Actually, this book had such a gentle, naïve feel to it, one could almost think it was an early book by Ms.Gilman, perhaps even pre-dating the illustrious Mrs. Pollifax, or the Clairvoyant Countess. It had such a very 50s feel to it, the sudden mention of a cell phone or computer was quite jarring. Plus all those wonderful beginnings by Miss L'Hommedieu were crying for middles and endings. Even with these niggles, though, it was still a most enjoyable book. With an added bonus--an alert to the newest Mrs. Pollifax adventure. Hooray!	2001-11-06

If you like to know the history of things, you'll truly appreciate this story in which an unusual wager is settled by a game of golf. The historic Old Course at St. Andrews in Scotland is credited with being the birthplace of that revered game, and one can only applaud Andrea Pickens for have done her homework so well. <br />Adrian Lindley, the Viscount Marquand, determined early in his life that he would not follow in the footsteps of either of his parents, known to society for their unconventional ways. For the Earl of Chittenden not only had a fondness for drinking but was also a gambler, unable to help himself in spite of numerous promises to his son that he would give it up. It took one final disastrous wager with the Marquess of Hertford to bring matters to a head. The Earl had done the one thing he'd promised his son he'd never do--wager Woolsey Hall, the last unencumbered property and the one closest to the heart of the Viscount. <br />Having experienced the residual effects of an overiding passion only too well, the Viscount had determined never to succumb to such lures for himself. He would be stable, and steady and dull, if that's what it took. That was why he'd proposed marriage to (and been accepted by) the beautiful Honoria Dunster. The blonde and beautiful young woman was considered a chunk of ice by many of the young men in London because of her lack of emotion. Adrian thought her exactly what he wanted and needed. <br />Of course, he was also a young man of his time, well up on shooting and riding and all the other manly activities. But the men of London seldom engaged in golf. So it was off to Scotland for Adrian to take a crash course in the game, as the only way to prevent the loss of his favorite estate, even if it meant nearly jeopardizing his true first love-- landscape design. A commission he desperately wants is about to be awarded, and time is short. But yet--there is Woolsey Hall to be considered. <br />To his great surprise, the game turned out to be far more complicated than he'd originally thought, and while Hugh Philp, the acknowledged master of St. Andrews promised to help Adrian in his quest, it was the young caddie Dirty Derry, who became his teacher. <br />Along with learning about the game, Adrian learns about himself, about Derry and about Honoria. For Derry isn't a lad, but an impetuous young woman, Derrien Edwards, who not only shares Adrian's great passion--landscape design--but has a prodigious knowledge of the game of golf--forbidden, of course, to females. Secrets unfold, while others are maintained, and tensions rise while waiting for the climactic game.<br />It's amazing how much story is stuffed into these 229 pages. Not one word too many is utilized in the setting forth of this story. It's simply marvelous! Worthy of the Masters, in fact!	2001-11-06

If you loved the 'screwball comedies' of the Golden Age of movies, and/or the cliff-hanger endings of the weekly serials from about that same era, you should truly appreciate the Leonidas Witherall books by Phoebe Atwood Taylor, written under the pen name of Alice Tilton. <br />This particular story whizzes by so rapidly, you'll find yourself struggling to catch your breath from the hustle-bustle, while laughing uproariously at the same time.  The truly amazing part of it (at least to me) is that there are 218 pages in this book, and all the action takes place in less than 24 hours! Amazing! <br />Leonidas is a William Shakespeare look-alike, and indeed, is frequently known as 'Bill Shakespeare'. His business persona is that of proprietor/headmaster at Meredith Academy, a prestigious boys school in Dalton, Mass., a suburb of Boston. The time is in the early 40s while the war is still being waged in both the east and the west. When Leonidas is not engaged in school activities, he is the author of the famous Lieutenant Haseltine adventure novels, written as Murgatroyd Jones. What with his own adventures, plus researching those of the good lieutenant, it's probably safe to say that, apparently, he knows every policeman in the state of Massachusetts, and a good many other states, as well. <br />When a huge deep-freeze is delivered to his home, Leonidas is determined that it is in error, and thus sets in motion the Harold Lloyd/Buster Keaton/Keystone Kops type non-stop action. As the freeze makes its way from house to house to school, he is visited by a lovely young blonde with violet eyes, the very personification of every man's birthday wish. Of course, it isn't his birthday, but the beautiful young lady in the gorgeous white gown and a corsage of violet-colored orchids is nonetheless positive she's at the right house.<br />In the meantime, the next door neighbors are moving, and the new family seems rather intrusive. And then there's Ernest Finger, or is he really Carlos Santos, and why does it appear that he's on everyone's 'most hated' list? <br />Leonidas and Terry (the blonde whose real name is Terpsichore!), his housekeeper Mrs. Mullet, and a cast of assorted folks as quirky and interesting as anyone could wish for, combine to make this one sensible, if breath-taking reading experience. I could barely stand to put it down, even though other duties beckoned. What fun! M'yes, indeed.  If you've not previously made the acquaintance of Leonidas, I urge you to do so. The sooner the better!	2001-10-31

Written with an ever-present and wonderful sense of wit, the two main characters, Jesmond Fitzroy and Mrs. Georgina Herron (a widow) strike silvery sparks off each other from their very first meeting. She is in a lad's togs and of course, that's what he thinks she is. No way. He has a hidden story in his life, as well, and it plays out against the normal Regency life of a small village. <br />Jess has inherited Jesmond House from an elderly aunt, and although he'd visited as a youngster, it's all so different now that it's his. Much of the acreage surrounding the house has been sold to pay overdue accounts. To his surprise, Jess discovers that all too many of the villagers have been forced into the same sort of situation, only to be rescued at the last moment (and for very low prices) by the village banker, Mr. Bowlby. <br />Mrs. Georgie, on the other hand, does not own land or house in Netherton, but has come to stay with her widowed sister-in-law, Caro Pomfret, whose husband had been Georgie's brother. Caro has gone into a decline following the death of her husband John, leaving her twin children Gus and Annie at very loose ends. Now nearing ten years of age, they thrive on Georgie's attentiveness.<br />This is not the sort of book one can read while doing other things; it requires your complete attention in order not to miss any of the delicious by-plays between the various characters. The secondary characters are very well-drawn, and many of them beg for their own book at some time in the future. There is so much plot that I'm not sure it could be adequately summarized in the word count allotted here for reviews. Nevertheless, I'd happily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a rip-roaring story set in any time period, especially when there's a delightful romance mixed in with it. Georgie is a heroine for all times, and Jess is very much her equal.	2001-10-31

Kittens have become so ubiquitous in Regency collections that it's not always easy to find an agreeable litter. In this book, however, two out of three are terrific! The third misses only because Beast (the third story) is in no way a kitten. At least if he is, I certainly wouldn't want to be anywhere near him when he reaches his maturity! That said, though, this book is still a winner. <br />When a huge dog adopts a tiny kitten, who could know the outcome? Certainly not the dog's master nor the kitten's mistress. Ariadne Whitcombe had troubles enough just in trying to keep the roof over the heads of her mother and younger sister, plus herself, of course. Waiting for the new heir kept the ladies all on edge, for it would only be at his discretion that the Whitcombe women could stay in the Dower House.  <br />Trying to protect a small kitten from a huge hound with only a broom for a weapon was perhaps not the best way to make the acquaintance of the Viscount St. Clare, but Ari couldn't help herself, even if the hound did belong to the handsome gentleman. The kitten is determined to spar with the dog, continually setting up meetings between the two humans, leading to a most satisfactory ending in this tale--INSEPARABLE--from one of Regency's best-selling authors, Janice Bennett. <br />A different sort of tale is told by Shannon Donnelly in CAT'S CRADLE. Bea is one persistent new Mama! She's determined that her kittens will be born and stay for their kittenhood in the library at Adair Manor, just the way she's always done it. Problem is, Adair Manor is no longer in the family, having been lost in a card game to a Sir Ashten Ravenhill. At first meeting, he doesn't appear to Emaline Adair Pearson to be the sort of stable, reliable person to give shelter to a new family of cats. <br />Of course, her two young sons disagree. Thomas and Will think the new owner is perfectly all right for anything at all, but most especially keeping watch over Bea and her family. And lettingthe boys share in the responsibility. Emaline thinks Bea and the kittens should stay in her home, but Bea disagrees. Eventually, the new Mama works her wiles on the wary ex-soldier and the prickly widow, forging new family ties and just incidentally, of course, securing her cupboard in the event of future kittens. A charming story from a talented new writer. <br />Another veteran,  Mona Gedney presents Beast in all his unusual glory in LORD WINTERGREEN AND THE BEAST, a very unusual tale about a most unusual cat. Trevor Stanwick does not particularly care for being blackmailed, so he sets out to discover the whys and wherefores of the mystery letters. Is young Grant the rightful Earl or is he not? Did Trevor's older brother Edward really marry the young woman Marilee Masters and have a child by her, before his death several years earlier, in the new United States? <br />To be sure, Beast plays an important part in finding answers to these questions, and as entertaining as he is, the story still seems rushed, almost as though it had been cut down from a longer story. That, however, shouldn't deter anyone from reading this delightful anthology. Even if you don't usually care too much for cats . . .	2001-10-28

Because of her weakened physical condition--a holdover from the accident that killed her mother and step-father--she was cherished by her new foster parents, a doctor and his wife in Biloxi, Mississippi.<br />After seven years of peace for Jeannie, Sam Dundee, a DEA agent on a stake-out is ambushed, shot, and thrown overboard. The tides carry him to Le Bijou Bleu, Jeannie's island hideaway, where she is resting before returning to Biloxi and the school where she works with 'special' children. Grievously injured, it is only because of Jeannie that Sam survives. Knowing he had been set-up, he left the DEA and started his own security service.<br />The Reverend Maynard Reeves, an egomaniac masquerading as a real Bible-thumper, tries to coerce Jeannie into joining 'forces' with him; when she refuses, he embarks on a modern-day 'witch-hunt' to bring her down. It is this threat that brings Sam back into Jeannie's life, as her bodyguard.<br />With the cunning of true malevolence, Reeves seems to know her activities almost before Jeannie does, endangering all she holds dear. Unwillingly thrown together for security purposes, Jeannie and Sam soon realize they would rather be together than apart, but where is safety?<br />Not even the island refuge is safe as a hurricane nearly accomplishes all that the reverend cannot. This could be a story from this morning's newspaper; violence has become so pervasive in our society.  GUARDING JEANNIE is the second volume of a trilogy sub-titled &quot;The Protectors.&quot; Sam is the kind of bigger-than-life hero that doesn't come along just every day, but it would have been a more enjoyable and believable story had the heroine been less selfish and stubborn, and a good bit more sensible.	2001-10-21

The author was once an editor, and here her keen eye is turned toward the publishing and media conglomerates which dominate the daily news. You will have fun guessing the alter egos of the main characters, although some of them are obviously composites of several bigger-than-life celebrities. This is a 90's story, for certain.<br />Jet setting from England to New York to Hollywood, the story involves a now elderly couple, Henry and Dorothy Hillings, literary agents from a time when talent was carefully nurtured until it was ready for prime time, and personal friendships were as important as the professional alliance. As they approach their golden years, they reach a gentleman's agreement to ease out over time, along with an old friend, the head of a media packaging firm, ICA. Unfortunately, during a hostile takeover, the old friend is manuevered out in favor of a young shark, Creighton Berns.<br />Doe suffers a heart attack when their office is padlocked, and while she is kept away from the action, many of their clients--both young and old--who have benefitted from the agency through the years come together in New York. Their intent is to wage war against ICA, even though several of them also have ties to the octopus-like ICA.<br />Some of the old-time writers are almost caricatures of the type, while newer media stars are so meticulously delineated that they fairly jump off the page. The city of New York is pictured so lovingly that it almost becomes a character in its own right.<br />The end, when it comes, will have you cheering the indomitable spirit of that grand old lady, Doe Hillings, who unearths the secret behind the takeover, and carefully engineers a takeover of her own.  Her five most able lieutenants, author/historian Elizabeth Robinson; conservative radio personality Montgomery Grant Smith; movie star Georgiana Hamilton-Ayres; one-time author now movie producer David Aussenhoff; and brand-new author Patty Kleczak, each have their own secrets but nevertheless are able to successfully follow Doe's instructions and rout the bad guys.<br />I liked this book so much that I was immediately off to my library for the author's previous books.	2001-10-21

To her surprise, other than the leader, Major Clint Bonner, the freight drivers are almost all women, heading west with the Goodnight's Good Times Emporium of Miss Phoebe Goodnight.<br />The first portion of this book details not only the struggle--to achieve their destination, but also the bonding between the strangest assortment of women you could imagine. You won't soon forget the bath scene just shortly before their arrival at Virginia City.<br />Once arrived in Virginia City, however, all manner of surprises lie in store for all the characters; Carson, Clint, the women, the other drovers, the townspeople. Clint and two of his male companions had once been part of a circus; they are determined to use that background in establishing an opera house gambling saloon hotel. Carson is equally determined to find the friend she thinks has been 'bought' as a bride. The women settle quickly, and two of them find husbands. Only Carson is lost, undecided, the victim of the first real love she's ever known-- from anyone.<br />Having sent reports of the trip off to Harper's Magazine, she is astonished when they are accepted for publication; the payment check allows her financial freedom while she continues searching for her friend. But when the two women finally meet, Carson is stunned to discover that all is not as she thought; her friend, Sophie, is truly happy in her marriage.<br />This sprawling novel follows Carson as she discovers her true self, a self she never knew, as well as how to trust and love-- and believe--in herself and others, especially men, and most important of all, one special man.	2001-10-21

The plots make sense and are intricately woven into the lifestyle of  the residents of Aleford, Massachusetts.  <br />Faith Sibley was an up-and-coming caterer in Manhattan when she met and married Tom Fairchild, a minister. This new lifestyle wasn't totally strange to her, as her father and grandfather had been ministers, as well. It was the New England part of the equation that was the jolt, but gradually the small town charm began to take hold, as did her transplanted catering business 'Have Faith'. The birth of their son, Benjamin, made life wonderful, until the first murder in THE BODY IN THE BELFRY.<br />Now, it's two-and-a-half years later, coming on for Christmas--the busiest time in the church--and in this story, a large old estate in a nearby town has been converted to a residence for the well-heeled older citizens of the area. Run by a doctor, Roland Hubbard, plus his son and daughter, the genteel establishment should apparently have no problems. But a friend of Faith's Aunt Charity has discovered something, and mentioned it in a letter to her, but without any explanation. And then, suddenly, he dies.  Aunt Chat asks Faith to please find out what went wrong. <br />When Faith seizes on the idea of visiting another resident acquaintance, she is taken for kitchen help, as the staff is temporarily overcome with the flu. She decides to go along with the idea, until the person she was going to visit collapses into the bouillion she had prepared. <br />An invitation to the Christmas Ball by the 'Pink Ladies' Volunteers takes Faith and Tom to Boston for the evening, and provides an introduction to the rest of the Hubbard family as well as various staff members, some of whom are definitely on the eyebrow-lifting side. As winter begins to settle in, preparations are underway for the church's Christmas season, not to mention allthe holiday cooking and shopping, and Faith is kept busy with all the activity.<br />Her car slides off the road during a blizzard, necessitating a stay overnight at Hubbard House. What a terrific opportunity to do some exploring! But, when Faith returns to her room, she finds it occupied. By a corpse. Following so close after an accidental fall by one of the Pink Ladies, it's time to call in the forces of law. <br />The presence of John Dunne, a Detective Lieutenant of the State Police, plus Charley MacIsaac, the local police chief ensures a thoughtful conclusion. Indeed, you could do a lot worse than to embark on this series of life (and the occasional murder or two) in a small town in New England.  I think you'll be glad that you did. My librarian recommended the first book to me, and I'm certainly happy I followed her advice.	2001-10-17

Writers are frequently told to summarize the entire plot of their book into one sentence; it is indeed an excellent exercise. That being the case, 'Pride goeth before a fall&quot; could be the condensed theme of this dazzling mystery by the late Boston attorney, Kate Ross.<br />The book jacket claims her detective, Julian Kestrel, as a worthy addition to the ranks of the 12th Century Brother Cadfael and the 1920's Lord Peter Wimsey, excellent company indeed. Kestrel is an inhabitant of London in the 1820s; a dandy lacking a gentleman's education, family, title or riches. During that era, façade was all important, when hours might be spent in tying one's cravat just so. Perhaps ten years after the self-exile of Beau Brummel, style over substance was still given too much emphasis.<br />This first novel is redolent with the sights, sounds and smells of the era, as we've come to know it from the books of Jane Austen and Georgette Heyer. Two years before the beginning of this book, Kestrel is the unwilling victim of a pickpocket.  Because the theft was of a valuable (although only to him) pocket-watch, Kestrel chases the thief and finally brings the miscreant down with a well-placed toss of his walking stick.<BR>  <BR>Impressed with the Cockney lad's sense of personal integrity--he made no excuses for himself, but accepted his fate stoically--Kestrel refuses to press charges, and takes the lad into his employ. Dipper becomes a valet, but bemoans to his new employer, &quot;When you got a gift, even if it was the Devil give it to you, you get a hankering to use it now and again.&quot; It is only by a brief return to the underworld of Dipper's London to uncover information available nowhere else that Kestrel is able to solve the mystery presented to him during a stay at Bellegarde, for centuries the country home of the Fontclairs.<br />Kestrel is not burdened with the pride of the Fontclairs. Good thing, too. They have more than enough for the entire country.  It is easy to understand why England has been invincible for centuries with just this kind of back-bone, which prizes personal honour above all, while seemingly ignoring the deception and lust which lay just under the surface.<br />Kestrel had rescued the Fontclair scion, Hugh, from a gambling den one night, and then, to his surprise, is invited to be groomsman for Hugh's upcoming wedding. The bride, Maud Craddock, and her father, along with Kestrel are the only outsiders present. Hugh's parents, Sir Robert and Lady Cecily; his uncle, Sir Geoffrey, a retired colonel lamed during Boney's war; and his son, (who is also Hugh's cousin,) Guy, and Lady Catherine, Robert and Geoffrey's sister, along with a young woman, Isabelle, who is actually cousin to Sir Robert rather than Hugh, make up the family. Lady Catherine has a husband and a home of her own, but she much prefers Bellegarde. She was, after all, born a Fontclair.<br />Lady Catherine is so prideful and bitter, she becomes the most obvious choice of villain; the wonderful character whom one loves to hate. On the other hand, Sir Geoffrey, who is responsible for the situation that makes a marriage by blackmail possible, is so wounded, both physically and emotionally, that you hope he is somehow found innocent, even when proof upon proof of his involvement is provided.<br />Maud and Hugh are tentatively drawn to each other, but the burden of the arranged marriage, the failure of which can only lead to the downfall of the Fontclairs, nearly destroys them, not to mention the balance of the family. Lady Catherine, spitting and spiteful, has hoped for an alliance between Hugh and Isabelle, but Isabelle has always been drawn to the carefree, penniless Guy, who is barely aware of her existence.<br />The mystery comes when an uninvited and unidentified young woman is found, having been stabbed to death, in Kestrel's assigned bed. Without fingerprints, chemical analysis, or any of the other resources known to today's Scotland Yard, Kestrel sets out to discover not only who she was, but why she was left in his bed.<BR>Ms. Ross skillfully keeps track of her myriad characters, and the somewhat sprawling plot; the denouement is a surprise. Her use of the language of the time provides a wonderful and colorful image of what the London and England must have been like during that age of elegance. This book is elegance personified.	2001-10-17

It's still readable, however, at least in my opinion.<br />A standard device in fiction is that of the baby left on a doorstep, who, upon reaching adulthood, or something reasonably approaching that state, sets out to find the birth parents.<br />The author hangs a 'Pastoral Mystery&quot; (the sub-title of the book) on this premise. Set in rural modern-day England at a country house, Cloisters, (once a monastery, of course), the past is nearly as important as the present, with generations of the same family and/or townspeople laying the groundwork for the secrecy surrounding the parentage of the heroine, Tessa Fields.<br />Left on the doorstep of a vicarage, Tessa is told just such an engaging story throughout her life. Her adoptive 'Mum' dies when Tessa is just 11, and she is cared for thereafter by her 'Dad', the vicar, and his housekeeper, Fergy. A short stint in London as a career girl includes time spent at The Heritage, an antique shop run by the large and shambling Angus Hunt. All is for naught, however, in the face of the increasing pressure Tessa puts on herself to discover her real parentage. A closet romantic, she makes frequent references to such unrelated Regency-period staples as highwaymen and Lord Byron. <br />Cannell is a master (mistress?) at inventing eccentric characters; the Tramwell sisters, Primrose and Hyacinth, loom large in Tessa's story, as does Butler (the not-quite reformed burglar who stays on as the butler); Chantal, the beautiful and clairvoyant young gypsy woman, who is in love with Tessa's own love, Harry, and who supports herself as cook at Cloisters while earning her master's degree; Harry himself, (the missing unidentified heir); Bertie, another adopted youngster who has an imaginary friend, Fred, who nearly gets them all killed, and so on. In other words, your typical English house-party guest list.<br />At times, Tessa is a bit much, and you may wish for the end of the book to please hurry up and get to you, but overall, this is still an engaging and witty book. It could have used better editing; if misspellings get on your nerves, you'll find yourself becoming more aggravated than most readers. Nevertheless, all does end reasonably well, for Tessa does discover her birth mum and her own real love, almost simultaneously. They also discover a secret treasure which guarantees the continuance--for years to come--of Cloisters, but with the roof finally mended.	2001-10-15

In Curry's case, his mother had been the dominant influence with her loving guidance and support that propelled him to the boardroom of his own conglomerate. Ivory, on the other hand, was compelled to run away from her widowed mother, whose fondness for alcohol and various men made life hell for the Texas girl.<br />Ivory did, however, display a talent for drawing and design; a scholarship to a design school provided her with her first boost up the ladder toward success. Nearing graduation, she took first place in a competition, offered by Curry's fashion enterprises. The prize was a position as junior designer.<br />Despite sending half her salary to her mother as a form of blackmail, Ivory quickly settles in to her new job and an apartment in Queens. Volunteering one day a week at a shelter for the homeless, she befriends a young boy who is HIV-positive and his mother.<br />The promised position at first appears to be a dead-end, as her supervisor cannot accept new talent. The company is losing money at a prodigious rate, and after a peaceful run-in with her new boss, Ivory is talked into showing him some of her designs.  Drawn to each other in spite of their own personal reasons for not wanting to become involved, Curry and Ivory set about designing and producing a dazzling new collection.<br />All should be well, but Curry's mother is diagnosed with cancer, and he loses his mainstay. Her new success splashed nationwide by the media, Ivory's mother discovers her new identity and location and promptly invites herself to New York. Once there, she cannot abandon a lifetime of selfishness and nearly destroys Ivory and Curry--and the company--in the process. Fortunately, an overheard tid-bit of conversation makes all clear, allowing Curry to reclaim Ivory, but this time as more than just his senior designer.<br />This is a fast-paced but satisfying 'glitz' novel that demonstrates the hazards of keeping secrets.	2001-10-15

Sometimes, the early promise is lost somewhere along the way. In other cases, the author gets better with each successive book, and I'm happy to say that I believe the latter to be the case with Lynn Collum. <br />This is the final book of a trilogy that involves a special charm featuring the Goddess Minerva; a charm that will bring wisdom and prudence to the one who wears it. Having worked its spell on the two Addington sisters (The Christmas Charm and The Valentine Charm) the medallion has returned to Alexander, their older brother, and the one who purchased it in Rome many years ago. <br />The Addington siblings--half English, half Italian--have all made their way to England, after the deaths of their parents. Alex, with few prospects of his own, and fearing to be conscripted by Napoleon's Army, is sent to England, and eventually finds his way into Wellington's Army. <br />Now, to his surprise, he discovers himself to be the Baron Landry of Landry Chase, the family title to which, as his father was only a second son, thus going off to Italy to pursue his own career as an artist, Alex had no idea that he was even in line to inherit. If only there would be funds to accompany the title and the estate.  But of course, there weren't. <br />Except that things are not always as they appear to be, and during all Alex's time as a soldier, he's sent money home to be invested toward the day when he would be able to care for his sisters once again. Alex is nearly bowled over to discover that he is wealthy, due to expert investments made by the grandfather of Alex's friend, Sir Roger Howard. <br />When the two men arrive at the Chase, they are dismayed by the state of the house and other matters. Alex's Aunt is determined that his only plan will be to plunder the estate, such as it is. She has high hopes of a match between her daughter Elaina and the neighboring Earl of Westoke.  Also in residence are the half-French niece and nephew of Lady Landry, Valara and Neville Rochelle.<br />This is a very enjoyable book in every respect; well-written, with engaging characters about whom you'll want to know more; a plot with spies and smuggling and the scenery of the Norfolk coastal area. Not to mention a double romance, and the spirited Lady Margaret! All wrapped up in one neat, very readable package, I don't think you'll be at all disappointed in this book.	2001-09-11

It can be very frustrating to the reader to come into a series mid-way.  This book, number 4 of a series called &quot;A Jersey Shore Mystery&quot; is so inviting and easy to read that I never found myself wondering what had happened in the earlier books. I enjoyed it so much, however, that I do intend to find out. <br />Set in Oceanside Heights, just a bit north of the famous Cape May, the ocean is an ever-present backdrop to the events that happen in Anne Hardaway's life.  Anne is a 30-something ghostwriter, who inherited her small ocean-front home, and resides there with an elderly, one-eyed cat, Harry. <br />A lot seems to have happened in Anne's life since the first book (I've yet to read books two and three, but will remedy that lack very soon.) Thank goodness, there is a new policeman in charge--the handsome, enigmatic Mark Trasker. (This is a relationship to which I look forward with great anticipation., but you'll have to read the book to find out just exactly why.)<br />To find a grandmother caring for a grandchild or other young relative isn't exactly news any more, in today's world. Delia Graustark, the town librarian, has her teen-age niece Tracy, living with her; a typical cynical teen-ager who thinks no one in the world can understand her problems.  When one of her friends is found dead, the aura of witchcraft quickly raises it's head, linking the two young women with others in town. <br />Anne is still supporting herself with her ghost-writing, and the current live pretend-author, Dr. Arlene, as she's known to her supposedly adoring public, is a self-help guru, particularly in the field of parenting. For reasons mostly known only to herself, Dr. A. descends on Annie for the duration--ostensibly to help with the book, but in reality, because Dr. A. has an entirely different agenda. <br />The two sets of stories are beautifully interwoven throughout the book. One set is Anne and Mark and the old-timers of the town who haven't forgotten Anne's mother, and aren't going to let Anne forget it either--and the other set is the loneliness and isolation of the teen-agers, set against the frantic Dr. A. <br />Wonderful. On every level, this is a terrific book.  Highly recommended!	2001-09-11

Somehow I missed the first book in this series, WOLF AT THE DOOR, probably because I really don't do books with wolves (of whatever variety) within the pages. I do not intend to go find it now, either. Nor would I recommend this one to anyone, unless they like to read rather silly stories with more holes in than a sieve. <br />Well before Chapter 3 (page 27) I was grinding my teeth. Why doesn't she take this dog and herself to obedience school? I wondered. I continued to wonder this for the entire duration of the book. I do like dogs, but a little discipline exerted by both Annie and Claudius would go a long way toward solving most of the problems encountered by either of them, not to mention the rest of the townsfolk.<br />I found the continued viewpoint of the dog a bit too cute and more than a bit too confusing, mixed in with Annie's as it usually was. It also isn't fair to the reader to hold out clues to the perpetrator of the crimes, as was done here, either. In my opinion, the characters were very stereo-typed, almost farcical, but then, any town lumbered with a police officer like Gus Jackson deserves whatever it gets. I will say, however, that Annie must be an absolutely superwoman who has figured out how to get more minutes into an hour than the rest of us, in order to accomplish all the things she does in such very short spaces of time. Very confusing. I sincerely doubt I'll read any more of this series.	2001-09-11

In her mid-thirties, struggling with life, trying to earn an honest living, she's everywoman, rolled into one. Shy, insecure yet tough when she needs to be, Anne lives in the small oceanside town in which she was born, and has always lived. This is both good and bad. The good part is that she knows everyone and they know her.The bad part is that she knows everyone and they know her.<br />Nearly twenty years earlier -- the summer Annie graduated from high school, and the country celebrated it's Bi-Centennial -- a tragedy occurred in Oceanside Heights. A little girl died in a fire that destroyed an old hotel. The town's pre-eminent 'bad boy' was suspected, but before anything could really be proved--for or against-- Tigger Mills left town, never to return. Until this year. <br />Drawn to him as she had been all those years earlier, Anne has a brief encounter with Tigger, and the promise of more to come -- but the promise will be unfulfilled, as Tigger drowns early the next morning. His half-brother Jack comes home from New York City to find out what happened. <br />Various elements of small-town life take their turn on center stage: the religious campground aura that defines Oceanside Heights; renewing acquaintances with former school-mates, some of whom would rather stay distant; getting to know Jack and his new life; and over all, families then and now, and the many secrets buried and thought dead only to have them come to life again. <br />I loved this book. I love Ann Hardaway as a character, and will go search out books two and three in the series. The first two that I've read have been well written, with wonderful characterization (both the goodies and the baddies are fully realized), and the setting is marvelous. Reading one of these Jersey Shore Mysteries is almost as good as a week spent on the beach. Try one for yourself--I think you'll agree!	2001-09-11

The very enchanting &quot;Lord Stanhope's Proposal&quot; was not a fluke. Jessica Benson's second book, &quot;Much Obliged&quot; is every bit as wonderful as the first one was.  This is not always the case, as many of us have learned to our sorrow. <br />Here we have John Fitzwilliam, Earl of Claremont, who was betrothed to Adelaide  while she was still in her crib, both fathers being age-old buddies. However, as is usually the case, distance does its thing, and now that the younger ones are of an age to marry, they're rather disinclined. Neither father is still around to provide any nudges, which is also a hindrance to their once-grand plot. <br />Addie's father was somewhat of a gambler, however, and left her and her younger sister Justine, with pockets to let, but in the care of their Aunt Honoria. Addie has a pair of very special skills, which she is not at all hesistant to utilize in the necessity to keep them all fed and clothed and reasonably warm. Her father was a best friend of the noted pugilist 'Gentleman' Jackson, who has retired from the ring as a fighter, but runs the noted salon where other gentlemen may work out with him from time to time, and learn the art of manly protection. Addie learned all about this science at an early age, and is now considered to be very knowledgeable on the subject by none other than the Gentleman himself. Her other skill is the written word, and she combines these two activities to pen an anonymous column about the happenings at Jackson's salon. <br />When Fitzwilliam comes to grief at the hands of a friend, what worse will happen to him when he is challenged to defend Addie's honor -- in the ring? Jackson and Addie set up a training regimen to be conducted at Claremont's country estate, which promptly turns into a farcical house party, complete with encroaching Mamas, (none of whom are at all friendly with any of the others) hopeful daughters, a know-it-all son (temporarily betrothed to Addie, in what she saw as a self-defence mechanism -- she needed protecting from herself as well as from Fitzwilliam), an abundance of dogs, tempermental servants, you name it--it's to be found at Kenton House. Along with lots of Benson's wonderful ways with humor and words. A triumph!  Now, we can only--and eagerly--anticipate the next sure-to-be-delightful opus.	2001-09-11

Here is another excellent and wonderful Regency tale from Sandra Heath, who is absolutely the most creative writer I've ever encountered. It's entirely too bad that whatever nourishes her imagination can't be bottled and sold to authors everywhere. There would certainly soon thereafter be a shortage of dull, boring, books.<br />Easy Conquest has all sorts of unusual components: the heroine, Emily Fairfield, is thirty-three and a widow who most lovingly remembers her husband. Geoffrey had been killed in a riding accident nearly six months before this tale opens, leaving one son, Peter, now eleven. Due to Geoff's gambling debts, Emily is about to lose the family home, Fairfield Hall, which the author describes thusly: &quot;It was a half-timbered Tudor building, and over the centuries the foundations of the house had shifted and the timbers warped, giving the building an astonishingly drunken look, as if at any moment it would lurch to one side or the other, jump over the moat, then reel its way across the park.&quot;<br />Emily's Mama, Cora Preston, also a widow, resides with Emily and Peter, and also remembers her long-lost love Felix Reynolds, with great fondness, considering that Felix was NOT her husband, but a several-times-removed cousin.<br />Felix is now in Lima, Peru, recovering from the ague, when he realizes that nefarious happenings have jeopardized the welfare of the ladies he loves most in the world, and he pleads with his young English friend, Jack Lincoln, to go back to the country Jack had left some five years previously, and try to straighten out all the mis-deeds. And mis-deeds there are aplenty, for Jack is accompanied by his Peruvian host, Don Cristoval de Soto, and Cristoval's Inca Indian, um, somewhat servant, Manco. Manco is the sort of wonderfully ebullient character who will stay with you long after you've finished reading this delightful tale. Certainly, the village of Temford will never be the same again after even a brief stay by Manco, who definitely marches to his own drummer. Except that in his case, it's a flute.<br />The first mis-deed is that Emily has just agreed to a marriage with Sir Rafe Warrender, who is not above a bit of coercion if it will get him what he wants. And he wants Emily! The truth of Geoffrey's death is nowhere in evidence, nor is the real reason why Rafe is so determined to have Emily for his own, in spite of major objections by Cora and Peter and Jack, and nearly everyone! <br />Now, it just so happens that Jack and Rafe are cousins, but Jack has been done out his inheritance by Rafe. Hmmm. Of course, it was love at Jack's first sight of Emily. But she is determined to do her best to protect her son from any scandalous tales about his father, and it appears the best way to do that is to marry Rafe. The betrothal is to be announced on Bonfire night, otherwise known as Guy Fawkes night, a few days after Hallowe'en, but not if Jack has anything to say about it. And does he ever!<br />An amazing amount of discoveries are made, old mysteries are solved, and wrongs made right in this highly unusual, very creative and humorous tale. Simply wonderful, in fact.	2001-09-05

To the best of my knowledge, for some reason I'd never encountered anything by this author (Nancy Livingston) before seeing this book at my library. It looked to be something different, and it really was. It's sub-titled a &quot;G. D. H. Pringle Mystery&quot;. But you should know that it isn't really a mystery so much as it is a suspenseful thriller. And while there is indeed a G.D.H. Pringle, who seems to be a very nice older gentleman, this is really a &quot;Mavis Bignell&quot; story. The interaction and romance between these two totally untypical protagonists lends a charming and sunny touch to a story that occasionally skirts the brutal, dark edges of the underworld. Mavis has obtained a left-over charter ticket to Australia, and inveigles Mr. Pringle into accompanying her. She plans to combine her sight-seeing with a search for a friend's grandson, who's been taken after a divorce, to Australia by his father. And then, apparently, the boy disappeared. What Mavis doesn't realize at the outset is the group that sponsored the charter: Friends of Nuclear Energy are atomic engineers and such, who wish to secure a burial place for nuclear waste that is not in *their* British back yards. An unlikelier batch of folks--or travel companions--you won't meet on every corner, believe me. Thank goodness! The other skein to this twister is about the ubiquitous drug-trade and the coldness that permeates it as well as those who run it. Mavis is the unintentional catalyst for all the things that happen, which does include the whereabouts of the missing boy. This is revealed in a strange sort of twist at the end of the book, which did not, in any way, affect my enjoyment of it. Of course, the book is 13 years old, and we know a bit more about some of these things than we did then. I wish I could have given it 4½ stars, it's that different. And that well-done.	2001-08-26

Laurie has her petite feet firmly on the ground, literally, as one of her favorite activities is tending to the gardens. She also likes cooking and excels at the gourmet variety. Simon is a dreamer. How can he use this unanticipated opportunity to fatten his somewhat empty coffers? Simple, my dear Watson. Simon conjures up a 'thirties mystery weekend' - Murder at Madingley Grange. Laurie has her doubts, but as Simon has already placed the advert in THE TIMES, she grudgingly goes along with him. Doesn't she always? But, if her erstwhile fianc should be there to help out some, that would work. Wouldn't it? Blend in the usual assortment of eccentrics: the widowed mother with beautiful daughter hoping to land a country home of her own; the mature married couple and his mother, a gypsy, who might do a bit of 'seeing' if asked nicely. The husband of this pair is a frustrated vaudevillian, specializing in juvenile-type jokes and pranks. Another couple, of which the husband is detective buff, wishful of becoming the next Sherlock Holmes, while his wife may not be everything she seems to be. Two independent young men: one hoping to capture the above-mentioned daughter, and the other a devotee of the thirties, complete to clothing, etc., and mostly unaware of other surroundings. Add two of the most unusual domestic servants you'll ever encounter anywhere, and the scene is set for one long laugh. It's almost a comedy of errors, combined with manners.

Each layer has its own variety of satisfaction embedded in it. This does not mean that I think all her books are alike. Oh, no! Nothing could be further from the truth. Well, there is one common thread in all of them: gays and lesbians are treated like ordinary, normal people. Which, of course, they are. We get to know them, and love them and laugh with them, in all their human foibles, even as we learn more about ourselves in the process, and discover the ultimate secret: how much alike we all are. In the previous book, Jane was severely injured, and needs a lengthy recuperation period to regain her strength and stability. A former lover, Dr. Julia Martinson, wants back in Jane's life, and suggests a stay at her secluded cabin--a non-rustic year-around home, north of the Twin Cities. In spite of some little niggles of her own, and bigger ones from Cordelia (Jane's long-time best friend), Jane agrees to the rest period. At the same time, an enterprising young woman, Patricia Kastner, has launched a campaign to turn an old downtown hotel into a Senior Living complex. With the help of a group of local philanthropists, she is on the verge of locking up the financing when one of the group is found dead in the empty hotel, after a meeting with the architect. Patricia, who is hoping to bring Jane into the project to supervise the food service, is also interested in becoming more than just a friend to Jane, and asks her to please investigate the death. Very much a novel of today's world, mirroring the headlines in tomorrow's paper, Ms. Hart manages to blend her characters, her settings and her plot into a very believable, totally enthralling novel. This short review cannot begin to do justice to such a multi-textured book. Read it for yourself, and enjoy. You won't soon forget this one.	2001-08-26

I hope it lasts as long--or longer--as the other one. In fact, I hope they both continue for a good long time. <br />Lady Elizabeth Hartleigh Compton is the owner of the Manor House of Sitting Marsh, in Norfolk. Proximity to the coast soon brings the war rather closer than it might have been, as a group of American officers are to be billeted with her, much to the dismay of her small staff. Martin, the butler, and Desmond, the gardener, are decades past the retirement age, but all the younger men are off to the war or other more 'important' tasks, so they stay to protect and serve their 'lady'. Violet, the woman-of-all-work, has been part of the House since before Elizabeth (now thirty-one and divorced) was born and has no blinders over her eyes whatever. Tart-tongued and hard-working, she nonetheless loves her young mistress, and is at the same time afraid for her, with all these young men to be staying in their house! <br />Major Monroe, whose first name is really Earl (the same title held by Elizabeth's deceased father) is a fine example of the young men who fought so bravely during World War II, but wishes she would unbend enough to call him by his first name. She, on the other hand, adheres to the old customs and cannot conceive of such informality. This emphasis on civility and courtesy is one of the strongest points in the book, replicating as it does real life at that time. <br />One of the village girls, a bit too boy-crazy for her own good, goes missing, and her distraught mother asks Lady Elizabeth to find her. Unfortunately, the girl, Beryl, is soon found--dead. And pregnant. Neither Beryl's mother nor Elizabeth have much confidence in the local constabulary, so in spite of all her other more pressing duties, Elizabeth undertakes to find the person responsible. <br />The countryside around Sitting Marsh abounds with eccentric characters, most of whom will bring a smile or two when encountered by the interested reader. Some more than others, to be sure; but I for one, adored Martin, and hope he buttles right on through the war. It is greatly to be hoped there will be many more such Manor House Mysteries in the forseeable future.	2001-08-19

Having enjoyed the first in this series, I somehow missed the second. I won't miss any more, that's for sure. This third book is as comfy and cozy to wrap yourself up in, as a much-loved, hand-knitted sweater or afghan. Betsy Devonshire is a marvelous character, one that you can easily believe in, and wish to have as a friend; furthermore, she's a perfect match for Excelsior, Minnesota. <br />Betsy had returned to the cold midwest from San Diego for a much-needed respite from her immediate past while renewing the relationship with her sister, Margo. Unfortunately, Margo was the victim in book one, but she left her business &quot;Crewel World&quot; to Betsy, who, in spite of knowing little about the world of needlework, endeavored to settle into it.<br />Learning how to run a business, as well as learning about needlework exposes her to all sort of people and situations, while allowing her to use her not inconsiderable curiosity to help the small-town police department solve persistent puzzles. <br />In this episode, it's very near to Christmas, and while Trinity Episcopal Church prepares for the holiday season, it is also preparing for a major renovation. To the surprise of all, a mildewed, hand-worked tapestry is discovered hidden away in a closet. When it's discovered to be the work of the previous rector's wife, all concerned decide to restore the piece as a decoration for the new addition.<br />Immediately, strange things begin to happen to Betsy, who has agreed to furnish any yarn necessary for the renovation of the tapestry. One of the strangest, while totally unconnected, is a visit from her former husband, Hal the Pig, who seems to sincerely want to mend his fences and re-establish the relationship with Betsy. Not surprisingly, she is of the totally opposite opinion.<br />With the help of Jill, the policewoman, the mysteries--old and new--are all eventually resolved. Hal is sent on his way, and we're left with a warm feeling towards the inhabitants of CrewelWorld and Excelsior, Minnesota, in spite of all that fluffy white stuff all over the ground.

The question seems to be: if the person in question didn't exhibit any such preference during their lifetime, why have them do it now? But I say, why not? <br />Most of these historical detectives are writers, or other such creative folks. And if you stop and think about it, what qualities especially contribute to the success of a detective of any era, but most especially before the age of technology? <br />Well, I think it would be perception, acuity, intelligence and a willingness to allow the suspension of disbelief for at least a short period of time. And what are the characteristics most needed by authors? (Other than a thick skin, that is.) Why--perception, acuity, intelligence and a willingness to allow the suspension of disbelief, along with some skill at writing and using the language. I suspect a curiosity bump would come in handy, too! Makes perfect sense to me.<br />This book is a case in point. Samuel Clemens, whose main fame is as the famous author, Mark Twain, takes his family and his secretary/assistant/man-of-all-work, Wentworth Cabot, to Florence, Italy, for the winter. Clemens is, however, treated rather coolly by the citizens of Florence, their feathers still ruffled over what he'd written about them after his previous visit. <br />Wentworth uses his spare time to indulge his passion for great art, with which Florence abounds. He also stumbles over a cafe that plays host to other visiting Americans: chess-players, as well as artists of all kinds, from all countries, and a few anarchists mixed in. Not to mention a few anti-anarchists. It's a marvelous mix! <br />The period detail seems perfectly wonderful as Wentworth describes the leisurely lifestyles enjoyed by his employer and his new-found friends.  Murder will, of course, present itself, and it takes a combined effort by Clemens and Cabot, along with several unusual policemen to getto the heart of the matter. They do, in a very satisfactory manner. This is not a fast-paced book, but one that may be easily read--and enjoyed--in shorter doses, if desired.	2001-08-10

When a story flows along as smoothly as does this one, you know the author has lavished great amounts of time and attention to it.  It's even more difficult to produce a wonderful story, one that's written well, and complicated by taking place in a different time and place than the one we live in. <br />Rosemary Stevens has obviously studied the Regency period more than most of us, and it shows to great effect in this, her second mystery novel featuring that marvelous arbiter of all things fashionable--George 'Beau' Brummell. Since no one is alive now (at least I don't think there is) who actually knew the Beau, the author has created him from the bits and pieces to be found in the many books, magazines and newspapers that have come along since the early 1800s. I'll go so far as to say that if the 'real' Beau wasn't exactly as Rosemary has created him, then he certainly should have been!  Warm, witty, wry, intelligent, and a connoisseur of all things--especially life, this Beau is indeed very special. Perhaps more so, even, than he is reported to have thought of himself. His attention to detail stands him in excellent stead when laboring in the role of detective. <br />But then, was any detective more blessed by his confederates than the Beau? Chakkri and Robinson form the perfect team to sniff out and report back to their leader. Each in his own fashion, of course. And of course, every man needs a woman by his side to bolster his ego occasionally, and to encourage his subtleties in a society not particularly known for its subtlety.  Frederica, the Duchess of York fills that need wonderfully well, and even though she is entirely given over to dogs, still Freddie and the Beau are a formidable pair. The other woman in his life is Miss Lydia Lavender, who runs a home for distressed women, and is anything but distressed herself! <br />While the Beau's first adventure was set in London, this one takes him to Brighton, the formerly sleepy village made into a posh resort by Prince George, who would soon become the Prince Regent, and subsequently King George IV. Where Prinny goes, the other fashionables follow, as do the problems besetting the Heir Apparent. In this episode, the Prince has received anonymous letters threatening his life. Although surrounded by guards, and his own personal taster, Prinny still turns to his friend, Brummell, to find out the identity of the mysterious author. Goodness knows--there are any number of folks who might have liked to create trouble for the sometimes selfish, unthinking monarch-to-be.<br />Unfortunately, before that puzzle is solved, two other crimes occur: the body of a young lady is found washed up on the beach, during a walk by Beau and Freddie. More disastrous, however, is a wonderful antique snuff box, making it's debut in the company of its owner, Lord Petersham, and which appears to have contained poisoned snuff! By a stroke of fate, Prinny escapes the poison, although everyone present knew he was to be the first to experience the new blend of snuff!<br />Other 'personalities' of the era wander through the Pavilion and the pages of this book, each contributing in his or her own way, finally leading Beau to a most satisfactory conclusion. Prinny lives to spend more money that he doesn't have, and Beau--?  Well, we'll have to wait and see, I guess. I hope it doesn't take too long, though. Hurry, Rosemary! Write faster!

It is just simply wonderful. <br />Who among us has not longed to throw over the traces, so to speak, and just DO whatever we most wanted to do, regardless of consequences? Most of us are civilized enough that our list of things to do would be very like that of Miss Rosie Lacey, when she sets off on her first visit ever to London, where she will stay with her somewhat scandalous Aunt Fanny.  For Rosie wants rather simple things: to see the Tower, and the Egyptian Hall, to ride in a sporting vehicle (or even drive one!), be kissed--thoroughly--by a rake, etc., etc.  <br />She is, after all, six-and-twenty, and does not really have to be so afraid of scandal as would a younger miss. For reasons of her own, Rosie wants to see, participate in, and enjoy life to the fullest before returning home to Devon once again. Her long hair is cut and discovered to be curly, and the vivid colors chosen for her by the modiste emphasize the fact that she is indeed, no milk-and-water miss. She rushes headlong into the ton.<br />Her plans are abetted in some ways by Max Davenant, but stifled in others. Of course, with her joie de vivre, she has no trouble finding others to help her cross the items off her list, scandalizing matrons and the patronesses at Almacks as she goes. What fun!  Rosie, or Rosalind as she is after her transformation, brings a smile to every page of this delightful book, as she flings herself into her adventures, full tilt. She is truly a heroine you won't soon forget. <br />Max isn't so bad, either. He may well be a rake of the first magnitude, but underneath that hardened shell lies the heart and soul of a man who wants to love--and be loved in return---if only he could find the right woman. But when he does, she retreats to her country home once again. It takes the efforts of Rosie's father, Aunt Fanny and her new husband, plus a few others to bring the two lovers together again. Smiles all around, and most especially on the face of the reader. An absolute triumph!	2001-07-23

Quite possibly the only thing better than a 250 page novel by Judith Lansdowne is a 350 page novel by Judith Lansdowne. She is one magnificent story-teller, to be sure.<br />The longer length allowed in this book (labelled a 'historical romance' by the publisher) allows the author to develop plot and characters more expansively than would be possible in the shorter length. Hooray, I say! <br />All the conventions of a Regency romance are present here: the stigma of being from 'trade', the war in Europe, the process of making her 'bows to Society' by a young miss of good breeding, all gleefully mixed together in the very original, very special way of this gifted author who seasons everything so well with her own unique brand of humor and absurdity. The extra 'spice' this time is a mystery involved with espionage.<br />The main love story is a real treat! A widow, with two adult step-children, accompanies the younger to town, in spite of her tendency to awful travel-sickness. And sure enough, the carriage must halt beside the road, where it is encountered by a passing stranger. Fleur, Lady Marston, is in the throes of 'mal de coach' being comforted by her step-daughter Althea, when Lord Hartshire arrives on the scene. A fellow sufferer, he insists on sharing his own remedy for the ailment; a set of beads worn on the wrists, a sort of acupressure treatment, which he acquired from a Chinese seaman, somewhere in his past various travels. <br />Hartshire, known to many as The Spectre, is intrigued by the woman he aids. Fleur, on the other hand, wants nothing to do with him, believing as she does that having once been known as the Shipbuilder's Daughter and a scourge on Society, she will be denied the entrance to that same Society that she wants more than anything else in the world, but this time for her charge, Althea. <br />Even though this is called a historical novel, there are no love scenes within. What there is are several enchanting love stories, with enough sexualtension to please everyone and make the various match-ups sensible. Of course, there is the author's trademark brand of humor, and excellent writing. Not to mention characters so real, you expect them to walk right out of the pages and into your room. More, please.<br />Positively scrumptious!	2001-07-22

When this book was first published in June, 1977, (which means it was written at least one year prior to that date) the gothic novel was still the most popular type of women's story, and this book somewhat bridges the two genres: gothic to Regency. This was the first Regency novel written by the author, whose previously published novels were historical, most of them set in Medieval times. <br />As with all the books of Sandra Heath, there is an absolute essence of Regency England to it; this book could not possibly have been set anywhere else, in any other time. But yet, even though it really isn't as good an example of the Regency romance as her later books, it's still way better than all too many by other writers. This is quite simply one incredible author, who treats her readers with respect, always, when it comes to research and setting and that nebulous quality: believability. (Yes there is one small boo-boo in it, but considering some of the clankers in other books published, it's hardly worth noting, and doesn't really, seriously, affect the plot at all.) I suppose that I should have knocked off one star, considering this, but the writing, the setting and everything else is so good, I'm not going to do that! I stand with my five stars!<br />Sarah Jane Stratford is the natural daughter of a very wealthy landowner, who decides to use her as the tie to his fortune.  His nephew Edward grudgingly considers the match, although he'd much rather have his secret amour. The high-flying Jack Holland, friend to the Prince Regent, appears to be enamored of Sarah Jane, but then things are not always what they appear to be, are they?  And finally, there is Paul Ransome, who is finagled out of his family's estate by somewhat nefarious means, and finds himself indebted to the Squire. The secondary characters are just terrific examples of their ilk.<br />Most of this story is set in the moors of Southern England, and it's almost as good as a travelogue, not to mention the local lore and legends which greatly enhance the story-telling. This is not the typical Regency romance, and certainly is not a gentle book by any means, but time has not worn away its charms. And certainly, it amply demonstrates the wonderful writing future that lay ahead of this gifted author.	2001-07-04

It's every writer's dream--to be so good at your craft that someday, your favorite celebrity will ask or hire you to write his or her biography.  But what happens when the fantasy comes to life, and expands and grows into something bigger than real life? <br />This is the story of one such dream come true. Eileen Ramsay is an extraordinarily talented author who takes us on a whirlwind ride through the high-flying world of opera. Make that Opera, as in 'the three tenors' kind of super mega-stars, and the nearly incomprehensible lifestyle barely known, or even imaginable, to the rest of us. <br />Fern Graham is forty-something, married, two college-age children, and a home in the Lake District of England, where she and her husband, Max, both live and work--as writers. Tucked away is the novel she's always wanted to write, but the money from shorter pieces--fiction as well as articles--helps to keep their middle-class lives on track, enabling the children to not only attend, but also to enjoy college life. <br />And then one otherwise ordinary day, Fern's agent calls from London. Pietro Petrungero, the world's ranking tenor, is interested in interviewing writers, and will perhaps then choose one of them to write his authorized biography. Until now, Fern has loved opera, but from a distance--literally as well as figuratively. She cannot usually afford more than one or two live performances in a year, and then, she sits in the 'Gods', those inexpensive seats in the highest rows in the theatre. <br />Her trip to London begins inauspiciously, and somewhat dejected, she returns home, confident that someone with more presence will be the chosen one. Life goes on. <br />Until the second phone call. It seems that Petrungero liked Fern's shyness, and has decided that she is the one he will entrust with his life story. She is whisked away to Italy, to meet the tenor and his family, to start gathering the myriad details that will guide her pen. In addition to Pietro's wife, MariaJosefa Conti, the renowned soprano, there is also    his mother, Stella. Once the cast is assembled, the drama begins. For Pietro is not quite what the world thinks he is: a superstar Italian tenor. No, he was born in Scotland, as plain Peter Hamilton, a fact Stella had successfully hidden for years. <br />From Italy to New York to Scotland to Vienna, the world of Opera is a minor character in its own right, but one would not need to love, or even know much about it, in order to enjoy this sweeping story that could easily have come right off the front page of any international newspaper. If you've ever dreamed of living the jet-set life, here is a great look at it, from the limousine always at the ready to the 'handle-everything' super assitant, to splendid homes here and there around the world, ensuring a sense of home and continuity to support the constantly traveling artists. <br />As Fern uncovers more about her subject, he becomes two distinct persons to her: Pietro, the superstar who never quite forgets who he is and what he does, and Peter, the man who plays the piano for his own entertainment, likes to cook and go for quiet walks in the Vienna Woods. <br />Ms. Ramsay's name is a new one to most readers in the US; her first book, published by Walker nearly twenty years ago, was a Regency romance. After this heart-tugging novel, as up-to-the-minute as today's headlines, she will no longer be such an unfamiliar name to readers who want good, solid research and emotionally-satisfying writing. Be advised, however, that while there is a wonderful love story in it, Never Call it Loving is not really a 'romance' novel, and readers thinking it is, may be in for a disappointment. It's well worth the reading, however, and could as easily be enjoyed by men as by women readers.  Brava, Eileen Ramsay!	2001-07-02

Um, excuse me, I should say meandering through recent history, made all the more fascinating when you can remember it! <br />If you were a teenager in the years 1948 to 1960 or so, you may well recall the first invasion of those funny little foreign sports cars, brought over here from Europe. They all only came from Europe then, and folks really did call them that, 'funny little foreign sports cars'--or 'sporty cars'. It made no difference really to the masses, anything that wasn't made in this country got lumbered with that designation.  If you were at all interested in cars during those years, then you would love this book.  In the late 50s--early 60s, when I first started driving, I didn't want to be LIKE Denise McCluggage. No, I wanted to BE Denise McCluggage. Obviously, that couldn't work. This book is almost the next best thing. <br />She could have been the prototype for the Wonder Woman of the comics and TV, except the comic book version is older than she is, I suspect. It seems there was nothing she couldn't be--or do. A gifted descriptive writer, Ms. McCluggage was also a top-notch race car driver and skier, and could probably have held her own in today's WNBA, as well. <br />To know why the reality of this book is so special, one has only to read the quote on page 177. Already a ranked driver in 1958, she was was refused entry at Le Mans. &quot;The head of the organizing committee had told Luigi (Chinetti): 'This is an invitational race, and we do not choose to invite women.'&quot;  We have indeed come a long way, baby, in the intervening 43 years! (The title of this review is quoted from the book, as well.)<br />She also had the great talent of being in the right place at usually the right time. She got that story, or that ride, and proceeded to make it her own. Celebrities became her friends long before they became celebrities to the rest of the world. Some few of them were gone from us before we even knew them verywell, but she allows them to live on in the pages of this book, drawn from her columns in Autoweek Magazine.  <br />Competition Press was the Bible of the racing world in the 60s--mid 70s, and that was her creation, too. It was required reading for anyone caught up in the whirl of motor racing, as I was, then. I was in good company, though. And you will be, too, if you  remember the names of Fangio, and Moss, and Hill, and Briggs and Shelby and Ginther, and the list goes on and on and on. Some of the ones we didn't have time to know as well are treated just as fondly: Peter Collins, Mike Hawthorne, Jo Bonnier, Taffy von Trips, Jean Behra, the Rodriguez brothers, and on and on. <br />But it wasn't only drivers who became her friends and/or companions. No, there was Steve McQueen (before he became the film star we know him as) and Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Cal Tjader (before they became the jazz greats we know them as). And we mustn't forget the tracks with those magical names that will live forever in her words: Mille Miglia, Targa Florio, Nurburgring, Le Mans, Goodwood, Sebring, Monza, and the Speed Weeks at Nassau and Daytona Beach.      <br />And the cars. Oh, my! The marques that live no longer:  No one, and I do mean no one, wanted a Mini-Moke more than I did. My heart nearly broke for the wanting of it. The closest I could ever get to it was an MG1100. Not the same thing.  I did once have a very -much-driven BMW, though, and even a Formula Vee. But who wouldn't ache for an original Maserati or Delahaye, a Gordini or Stanguellini, Vanwall or OSCA. <br />If this book were to be scored on a numerical basis of 1 to 100, say, with 100 being the ultimate accolade, then this one would definitely be 99 and 44/100% perfect! An index would have given it that extra little something. But yet, reading these short (mostly four pages worth at a time) reprinted columns is perhaps enhanced by never quite knowing which name will pop off the next page as you carefully turn thatcorner, er, page, to the next episode.   <br />My favorite? Actually, there two. 'Driving through France (page 123) and 'Ring around the 'Ring' (131).  For different reasons. I always wanted to see the 'old' Ring, where my Dad used to walk over, some 50 km from his home village for the big races, and instilled that love in me, as well, and the other? Read it for yourself, and you'll know why. <br />Oh, marvelous, indeed. Now that I'm older and hopefully wiser, I realize that there could only ever have been one Denise McCluggage, and it wasn't my turn! Darn.	2001-07-02

However, as it's from Harlequin, it's slightly mis-labelled, which seems to be normal for them lately. This book, although a bit longer than the usual, is a true Regency romance. It isn't really a Historical Romance, except for the length. There is nothing even remotely resembling a love scene anywhere; just the right amount of sexual tension, an abundance of humor, strong writing and wonderful characters. Add all these in with a sensible plot that does not rely on the Big Misunderstanding in any way, and you'll easily see why I gave it 5 stars. I'd give it more if I could. <br />Newcomer Anne Gracie of Australia made a smashing debut with this book (which was actually published in the UK before Tallie's Knight, which rather gives the appearance of being first. Not so.) Gallant Waif was a finalist in the RWA RITA competition in 2000 for books first released in 1999. That news will come as no surprise to the reader. <br />Kate Farleigh was the only daughter, following two sons, of a small-town vicar. Her mother died in childbed, and of course, her father always thereafter resented the child, especially for her likeness to his wife. Until, during the war on the Peninsula, he decided to go visit his sons. There was no other choice than for Kate to go along, as well. It was here that she finally came into her own, and during the final two years of her life with her father they made a sort of peace with each other. Before the war ended, though, all three of the men in Kate's life became casualties. And then, so did Kate, herself, even though her emotional self was undaunted. She returned to England, determined to forge a life for herself as best she could. <br />Mad Jack Carstairs, on the other hand, came back from the war a somewhat broken man, unable to (as he thought) resume the life he'd always anticipated living. His fiancé cries off at sight of his scars and lame leg, although she blames her defection on his having been almost completelydisinherited. There is one property left to him; a run-down, isolated place hardly worth having, however, it does at least get him away from society. <br />But Jack doesn't reckon on the strong will of his Grandmother--one of those miniature gorgons who rules with a fist of lead. She's a wonderful, full-blooded creature whose god-daughter was Kate's mother. One day, for no good reason, Lady Cahill takes it in her head to find out whatever happened to Maria's only living child. Unable to convince Kate of her sincerity, she simply kidnaps the chit, and the adventure starts. <br />Kate agrees to be housekeeper for Jack, as his disheveled house is badly in need of one. Eventually, her common sense begins to see past his brusqueness, and she convinces him to accept her help. In secret. But that's certainly better than nothing, and her joy in his triumph is heart-warming. <br />But the Dowager Countess hasn't given up yet, either. After arranging for Kate's long-lost inheritance, she then arranges for Kate to come to London to have a Season, in spite of Kate's reluctance to do so. If you can read Chapter Seventeen (the main ball in London) without a tear or two, why are you reading a romance novel? This is the essence of a romantic novel, and you'll feel refreshed and renewed by the vicarious experience of this extraordinary book. I'm eagerly awaiting more from Ms. Gracie. But hurry!  Please!	2001-06-19

No, she doesn't work as one, but she always seems to bounce back--gracefully and easily--from the somewhat strange events in her life. Or, to put it another way, she bounces the lemons handed to her by life (which everyone knows is the way to make a lemon produce more juice) and turns them into stunning versions of lemonade, lemon pie, or whatever strikes her fancy. <br />Of course, the forty-something widow also has three wonderful kids, a full-steam-ahead next door neighbor and best friend, Shelley  Nowack, and a to-die-for-guy, police detective Mel VanDyne. Well, maybe not quite so far on that latter, but he is a 'certified' dish, no doubt about it. Even better, he seems to really like and respect Jane as a person. High marks in anyone's book, I should think. <br />If you've read any of the previous atrociously-punned titles about Jane, et al, you know that she and Shelley seem to find trouble under nearly every cabbage leaf they stumble over. The most recent book was no exception, distributing corpses for Christmas. But, out of that unseeming circumstance, an unusual opportunity made itself known to Jane. Livvy Thatcher is getting married, and being so impressed with Jane's management of the Christmas debacle, she asks Jane to organize and plan her wedding. Well, Jane's never done this before, but neither is she one to let such a trifling detail get in her way. <br />Problem number one is the scene of the wedding. It is an old family estate--complete with tales of ghost and buried treasure--some hour-and-a-half west (or thereabouts) of Chicago; a former hunting lodge that had previously been a monastery. Disregarding her qualms, Jane plunges in, arranging flowers (you, too, will 'love' Larkspur!), food, bridesmaid's dresses, the bride's gown, and the music, not to mention assigning rooms to the stay-over guests, either at the lodge or the nearest motel. She didn't however, arrange for murder. That was problem number two, and brings Mel to the scene to confer with the local constabulary. <br />Problem number six or so is the semi-reluctance of the bride to get to the point of being able to say 'I do'. Not to worry. Livvy may indeed be married, but she's not going to be a wife. At least not for a while yet. An assortment of oddly-matched guests, and even more odd family on both sides, suddenly seem to swirl all around the not-so-very festivities before Jane manages to unveil the killer.<br />I loved the different setting and the somewhat more-than-eccentric elderly Aunts and Uncle, and all the big and little details that Jane had to master in order to produce a perfectly beautiful wedding. But--although the killer and the motive for having done so did make a certain amount of sense within the confines of the story, it still sort of came out of left field. There really wasn't much build-up in the way of clues as to just who really was the fiend. Or why. Still, though, once unmasked, there could have been no other culprit. Will Jane continue in her new career field? Stay tuned. . .	2001-06-19

What a bawdy dish the Mistress of Mirth has conjured up for us this go-round! Laughs aplenty accompany our look at the underside of Regency Society in this rollicking book, in which nothing and no one is exactly as it--or they--appear.  It is almost a version of 'button, button, who's got the button', except that the missing item herein is a codicil.                    A codicil is a legal document, but worthless when it can't be found. This is the puzzle facing Annabel Gresham, whose grandfather's will carried such a codicil with it. Until it was lost. Or stolen. Or strayed. This codicil is of the utmost importance to Anabel, as it leaves the unentailed family estate and renowned collection of medieval paintings to her, the child of her father's second marriage, rather than her older brother, Lord Roderick Mavor, the child of his first marriage. Toby Vernon, Annabel's other half-brother (her mother's son by her first marriage) is sent to London with a new will by Annabel's father, but is way-laid and brought to a tavern to recuperate.  His rescuer is none other than Sir Richard Tregarran, the well-known rake-about-town. <br />The Dog and Duck, near Picadilly, is now under the care of a new licensee, Hester Ferguson, a former, um, well--she occasionally refers to her former life when she was an abbess. (She does not mean of the religious variety, either.) Although reformed, and loving her new career, she still knows (and keeps track of) all the other 'ladies of the night' and their 'nuns' as well as their patrons. <br />It is soon made very clear that a wide variety of nefarious doings take place in this particular area of London, just around the corner (more or less) from Almacks, and not too far from Marylebone, which was still in the country in the early 1800s.  <br />I certainly didn't know all the euphemistic appellations for these ladies of the night, and I'll wager you didn't either. But they're only a part of the fun, as these characters from both the high and the low portions of society play out their little games, some of which are not so nice, but end up without great damage being done to anyone. Except those who deserve it, of course.  It all adds up to one enjoyable, entertaining, and laugh-out-loud funny look at the bawdier side of Regency London. <br />The codicil is found, the bad guys are vanquished, and true love finds its mate. Er, mates, actually, as Richard's former sister-in-law, Catherine, and Toby make a match, as does Hester and her Mordecai, and of course, Annabel and Richard. Very satisfactory!	2001-06-12

It's an excellent place to start for the almost-new fantasy reader, as I was when I read it the first time. I had read a book by Nina Kiriki Hoffman, and it was her name on the cover that drew me into this one. Well, Donald E. Westlake didn't hurt, either. Of course, I had certainly heard of Harlan Ellison once I discovered his presence, also.  And major kudos to the editors for not splashing his name all over the cover as a ploy to sell more books! <br />If you think that fantasy is all outer space or off-the-wall type stories, then this book is a good way to disprove that theory. There really is all kinds of variety present here: historical, mystery, even a touch of romance. And, yes, there are some outer space and off-the-wall, too. In all honesty, I think there really is something for everyone in this collection, which, I think, is the way it's supposed to be. <br />Anyway, I was very much enchanted with this book. My particular and forever favorite story is &quot;The Nutcracker Coup&quot; by Janet Kagan. No wonder it won the 1993 Hugo Award. It's a truly powerful indictment against prejudice wherever it is to be found, and the way such intolerance is turned back on the 'bad guys' is really choice! I wish she'd write more.  My next fave was &quot;The Bedlam Inn&quot; by Madeleine Robins, because it could as easily have been in a Regency collection as this one. A perfect Christmas tale!<br />If you think that fantasy is all outer space or off-the-wall type stories, then this book is a good way to disprove that theory. There were really all kinds of variety present here: historical, mystery, even a touch of romance. &quot;Death in the Christmas Hour&quot; by James Powell is another winner in my book, as is Nina Kiriki Hoffman's &quot;LaZelle Family Christmas&quot;.  Well, but then, they must all be good stories, considering they're to be found in this highly regarded collection. I certainly read them all, but to be sure, some of them I did enjoy more than others.There was nothing in any of them to turn me off the idea of fantasy as a genre, that's for sure. I've happily recommended this book to many readers, and will continue to do so.	2001-06-09

I had heard many good things about this book, especially raves about the gorgeous cover. It's different, that's for sure. <br />Unfortunately, before I'd managed to get out of the first chapter, quite a few of my 'uh-oh' buttons had been pushed, and by page 65--chapter six--they were worn out from so much pounding, and I closed the book. <br />If you want to read about very modern-day characters, using modern-day language, but grafted onto a supposedly historical novel set in 1815, then you might be able to like this book. &quot;Please respect that decision&quot; is not quite what I would imagine a new wife of that era telling her husband, after she's calmly informed him that she has no intention of carrying a child. Any child. Regardless of her supposed intelligence, I found Caroline to be a very one-sided character, and Brent no better. Their 1999 sensbilities grated immensely, and even by page 65 I was confused about time-lines, etc. Too many books, too little time.	2001-06-04

I love them. Sometimes you just can't invest the emotional time in a full-length novel, whereas a short story is exactly right. Besides, I think it's fun to see what a favorite book author can do with the shorter, more restrictive form, and then, sometimes--an additional bonus--one can find new authors well worth pursuing from reading a good anthology. The Malice Domestic series of original traditional, mostly cozy stories is usually top-notch, and this tenth edition is quite possibly the best they've done yet, in my opinion.  Three stories alone--of the fourteen included--justify the cost of buying the book.  Simon Brett's &quot;A Note of Notes&quot; about 'a £10 note with attitude' is scrumptious, while M. D. Lake, in a wry, world-weary voice, explores the alphabet in &quot;A. B. C. D. E. A. T. H.&quot;, providing chuckles galore in this tale of two couples, unhappily married. <br />Anne Perry, the much-lauded author of two Victorian-set mystery series, has turned away from that time and place to produce a wonderfully humorous, charming story about a group of neighborhood detectives. Word has it that these creatures are based on her own menagerie of dogs and cats and other critters. This is, I believe, the third such episode featuring Daisy, a canine whose lineage is never quite defined, but who possesses immense common sense.  In &quot;Daisy and the Christmas Goose&quot; she doesn't let the fact that she's not quite certain of just what is a goose slow down the hunt for one that is missing. <br />Frankly, I wish some enterprising publisher would produce an entire book of short stories about Daisy and her cohorts, both canine and feline, and other-ines as well. The voicing of these critters is impeccable, sort of an 'All Creatures Great and Small' but in reverse. They're nothing short of wonderful! <br />All the stories in this collection are eminently readable. Too bad they can't do more than one such anthology a year.  Or else a bigger book, with more stories.	2001-06-04

Current events have inspired novelists since the beginning of time, and Jane Haddam is no exception. This book was written in the near aftermath of two such unhappy events: the bombing in Oklahoma City and the Susan Smith case. (The woman who killed her young sons.) <br />The author patiently develops thread after thread, until the picture formed becomes clear, rather than a muddled mass of colors. Some of these skeins are organized religion; the ultra-conservative, religious far-right; homophobia; lesbianism; Goddess worship; abused wives; the media and its power; plus a wide variety of stereotypes about religion, women, and the South.  <br />One of the things about the books of Jane Haddam that I greatly enjoy is that I always learn more about some things than perhaps I wanted to know, and others that I didn't know I needed to know until after I'd learned them. She does her homework. Dense and multi-layered, they're not at all easy to read, and once you get into one, they're even harder to put down, but OH! They are so very satisfying in the process as well as afterwards, and you'll re-read the book for weeks afterward in your mind. <br />This one takes Gregor Demarkian--at the behest of his old college friend, David Sandler, America's most well-known atheist--to the ocean shore of North Carolina, when, in the aftermath of a hurricane, a baby's corpse is discovered. Bonaventura is the highest ground in the area, therefore it had been opened by its owner, Zhondra Meyer, as a refuge to the townfolk who had no other place to go. Ginny Marsh had another reason for being there; she did occasional typing work for Zhondra, always taking her infant daughter Tiffany with her. It is Tiffany who becomes the main focus of the story--was she mutilated to serve the devil-worship thought to happen at Bonaventura? Or did her mother or father murder her for other reasons? Or, instead of the devil, was the homage being paid to the Goddess?<br />Zhondra had already opened the gatesof Bonaventura for other reasons--as a camp for gay women. Although, to be sure, it was inhabited more by women who had been abused in their marriages, and who finally found a safe haven behind the iron gates. As a member of the Communist Party, Zhondra felt obliged to use her immense inherited wealth to benefit those who had none of their own. Dissatisfied with her own life, she thought to help others find a better way to manage theirs. It was a good idea, but not a very successful venture. <br />Not long after the hurricane, one of the 'campers' is found murdered, and before that case has settled down, Zhondra herself is discovered, dead as well. Ginny cannot be responsible for these latter two deaths, she's been in protective custody since shortly after her baby's death. <br />Gregor talks to the two ministers from town: the Methodist Stephen Harrow and the charismatic Henry Holburn, who has enlarged a small country parish into the multi-thousand member Bellerton Church of Christ Jesus. Three women--Naomi Brent, the town librarian; Maggie Kelleher, owner of the only bookstore, and Rose MacNeill, owner of the religious goods store--as well as the town's police chief Clayton Hall, also play major roles. <br />You won't soon forget this elegantly written and wonderfully-crafted novel. Nor should you. It contains lessons that would benefit all of us. If only we'd pay attention.	2001-05-31

A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA is a very different sort of book, even for an author of Robert Barnard's excellent capabilities. Written in first person, it is narrated in a most engaging and chatty style by a former politician, Peter Proctor, who is (as are most retired politicians) working on his memoirs. But Peter Proctor was not just any politician, to be sure. He didn't rise very high, although he did achieve the status of senior cabinet     minister, as well as being an MP for several terms. What sets him apart, however, is that, when his career began in the Foreign Office, in the early to middle 1950s, England was trying to get itself back on the right foot again, after struggling through the War, only to find itself engaged in the massive blunder that was the Suez crisis.  Proctor had already resigned his post in the F.O., but was still shocked and unhappy by the brutal death of his friend, Timothy Wycliffe. The bigger mystery is why this death received so little press coverage. Tim's death also causes a monumental 'writer's block' in the mature Proctor, who decides to investigate the still-unsolved crime for himself.  The book takes us back and forth in time, as Proctor exercises his memory as well as himself while digging for the facts. <br />Of course, it was Suez that occupied so much newspaper space, but still, one would have thought that such a shocking death, and one with such a propensity for scandal and gossip, would have rated more than the occasional one sentence it did achieve.  For Tim was very open (for that time) about his homosexuality, and that was obviously the motive  behind the murder. At that time, such behavior was very much against the law, and was an imprisonable offence. To be sure, Tim was the grandson of a marquess, but still--<br />Not at all impressed with himself, Proctor is by turns still naïve (cocooned, he calls it), prescient, dogged, and most of all, a man at ease with himself. A man who, thirty-five years earlier, could have a good friend who was homosexual, while still being very hetero himself.  <br />It would appear that a young man, employed as an electrician by the BBC, Andrew Forbes, was labelled as the murderer, but everyone who will speak to Proctor, discounts that possibility. When Proctor travels to the US to, with any luck, confront Forbes, he finds himself believing the story he is told. Tim was alive, although battered, when Forbes left him.<br />With the help of his children, his researcher, old friends, and others, Proctor pulls away the layers of concealment to expose the perpetrator of the crime. By the time you've made the journey with Proctor, you'll definitely wish for more politicians in his mold, regardless of whether Whig or Tory, Labor or Conservative, Republican or Democrat. I promise you won't soon forget this book, especially the final few pages. Guaranteed to make the hair stand up on the back of your neck!<br />Robert P. Barnard has written a slew of books. To me, the only thing any one of them has in common with any other one, other than being a very enjoyable reading experience, is the marvelous writing accompanied by a very shart wit. The wit usually presents itself in different ways, depending on the plot and the characters, of course, but it is still ever-present. Hardly surprising, then, that he's won so many awards. They're all well-deserved.	2001-05-28

Even if I didn't care for--or read--His Lordship's Mistress, although I did, I would still have given this book 5 stars.  Married by Mistake has been on my list of top ten Regency favorites since I read it when it was new, and re-reading it now has only  confirmed my good sense in having put it there in the first place. The writing is crisp and clean and immensely witty, the plot devious and charming; and actually those two words can easily be applied to both the hero and the heroine.  Because really, it's the combination of the devious and the charm that leads to the accidental marriage of Viscount Alford to Florence Washburn in the first place. <br />The Viscount is supposed to stand proxy for his brother Kit, the long-time fiancé of Florrie, who spent time with the two young men during their youth. Florrie's father is in the diplomatic corps and she loves that life, so it seems only natural to marry Kit, who's really almost more of a brother than a lover, but who is also heading for that same sort of career. <br />Mishap after mishap follows, however, leaving Florrie and Alford married by mistake, but to each other. The two fathers conspire to send them away from the gossips in London, and in a month or two, an annulment can be sought. Needless to say, the young couple has no idea they'll end up together. <br />In the wilds of Devon, accessible only by a once-a-week dogcart, Hartland has a custodian couple, and little else to recommend it. Except for the resident ghost, and the hidden passage, and the smugglers and so on. Florrie and Alford take turns trying to disconcert the other, but usually ending up drawing even closer together, as their various secrets are revealed. Slowly, the past perceptions are replaced by the current consciousness, and suddenly, an annulment doesn't seem quite so desirable after all.  <br />Part romance, part gothic, part adventure, part Taming of the Shrew--but in the end, ALL the parts add up to pure enjoyment for the reader. <br />==============================<br />His Lordship's Mistress is another kind of Regency tale, entirely.  I must have read it, earlier on, as well, but it didn't leave as deep an impression on me. Certainly it's well-crafted, with a determined and engaging heroine, Jessica Andover, and a hero--Phillip Romney, the earl of Linton, who shows an unusual degree of  kindness and consideration towards her. <br />Having been victimized by a greedy step-father, and left nearly destitute--with her two young half-brothers--Jessica determines to find a way to salvage the family home. Only in that way--belief in herself--can she ensure the future of the two boys, who will need what she can give them.  <br />Taking no one into her confidence, she heads to London, where she uses her own very specialized education--excellent speech and diction, plus a thorough knowledge of Shakespeare--she auditions at Covent Garden Theatre.  She'd hoped for a bit part, but to her surprise, was cast in a leading part, all the better for her plan--to find a wealthy man and become his mistress. <br />Her plans work better than she'd hoped; she is a success on the stage, and finds the man to whom she can give herself. Of course, life is not a play, and the final act is not as she'd envisioned it. It was money that was the goal--not falling in love. Having earned enough    to pay off the mortgage, however, she returns home to let her wounds--and her heart--heal. Philip, however, takes her abandonment very hard, and determines to find her. And when he does--she won't get away from him again.... <br />I really like this concept--two full length previously-published stories in one volume, for barely more than the price of one new book.  I hope we see more of them. (Hint, hint.)	2001-05-28

It should come as no surprise that the second book published by an author is frequently not up to the same high quality of the first one. After all, that first one (probably) was not written to a deadline, but was, rather, fueled by the inner passion of the author. It's not at all uncommon to finish writing that first book, heave a tremendous sigh of relief, and vow to never touch another typewriter, or computer, as the case may be. Thankfully, in most cases, that latter sentiment doesn't last long, (although in some instances, it doesn't last long enough!) and in a day or so, the author is inspired enough to begin the second book.  Even with luck, however, if there is a contract staring him or her in the face, time can interfere with the creative process. <br />I don't know if that happened with this book, but it has certainly happened to many others.  I LOVED McCalls's first book  Dead Aim, and vowed to read all his others. It appears there are only three, so far, with just a year or two between the first two, but several years between the latter two. <br />Not that this book is in any way insufficient, mind you; it just isn't quite sufficient enough. Chris and Lyel are still in Idaho, still loving--and enjoying--the countryside, while indulging in the occasional bit of work, as necessary. For Chris, this is tracing lost musicians to whom royalty payments are due. Lyel's work is mostly clipping coupons. And not the cents-off-at-the-grocery-store-variety, either. <br />After a fatal crash at the local airport (and the two buddies are volunteer firefighters, providing us with vivid descriptions of such an activity) Chris is asked to help a local woman find her missing sister. And thus begins the chase. That's the really good part, with the loving look at souped-up 50s and 60s hot-rods (if you're old enough to remember when this was being done, you'll really cherish this part of the book!) and a bit of spy-type activity in California as Chris looks for the owner of abuilding who doesn't want to be found. <br />Published in 1990, the book is still up to the minute, with environmental concerns mixed with politics, and, underneath it all, the steadily beating heart of an appealing, yet lonely man. Now, to find that third book, and hope for a fourth. And a fifth. Maybe even a sixth?	2001-05-25

If the comparison is to an author the reader likes -- fine and dandy. But if it's one not so well-liked, then the risk is very real - quite possibly a reader lost for no very good reason. It's true, of course, that any period English-set mystery will conjure up mental images of earlier creations, but really, any book needs to stand on its own merits--and this one is well able to do just that.<br />Granted, Lord Edward Corinth is the younger brother of a Duke, as is Lord Peter Wimsey, but from there on, Edward is very much his own man. Hardly anyone does (or has done) period detail better than Dame Agatha Christie (in my own opinion, that is) but David Roberts has done an excellent job in recreating that period of England, between the two wars. At least I think he has, not having been there at that time myself, it being slightly before my time. Regardless of that, the writing is smooth and it's very obvious that a lot of research was done to acquire the wealth of period detail that is disbursed so credibly.<br />Edward's older brother, the Duke of Mersham (who inherited the title only because his older brother was killed in the first war) believes strongly that war is a giant waste of everything, and he believes he can help to avoid the possibility of another war. To this end, he invites several disparate persons to a dinner at his country home--Mersham Castle. There is the retired general, the press lord, the pacifist bishop, a politician, a distant German cousin and now diplomat, and Edward. These men will talk as civilised men do, in an effort to calm the rising hysteria.<br />Edward's sole task was to squire the step-daughter of the press lord, but rushing to the castle in his Lagonda, he runs afoul of a huge haywagon, and finds himself in the ditch. He is rescued by a dashing young woman, Verity Browne, who just happens to be a journalist on her way to the castle to interview the Duchess.<br />The two of them arrive at the castle just in time to witness the death of the general, and the further horror of reading all about it in the next mornings newspapers. From there, chaos ensues, and Edward finds himself strangely drawn to Verity as they work together to discover the truth. There will be more deaths as layer after layer of society is peeled back to reveal the truths previously unsuspected. During all of this, Verity is unmasked as a young communist, sincere if a bit mis-guided in her loyalties, whereas Edward is complex and chivalrous, in spite of himself.<br />You will have no trouble imagining yourself in 1935 London, as you travel its streets and nightclubs with Edward and Verity. The characters are well-drawn, likeable or not as the plot requires. The plot itself is not your ordinary one, but very workable. Justice is served in the end, and if not in an ordinary way, it is a mostly satisfying ending, clearly leaving the way open for a sequel or two or three. I'd be very happy to read more of the adventures of Edward and Verity, and if you like period mysteries, I suspect you might like them, too.the Duchess. <br />The two of them arrive at the castle just in time to witness the death of the general, and the further horror of reading all about it in the next mornings newspapers.

US	50289674	R209CVGF56NHOC	037351137X	557732254	Tallie's Knight	Books	4	16	17	N	N	a welcome new-comer --	As pleased as many readers must be to have a third major publishing house issuing books categorized as 'Regency Romance' (and I'm certainly one of them) I suspect many of these readers would be even happier if the books were to be correctly labelled. There is a world of difference between the 'Regency Romance' and the Regency-set Historical novel. All of the recent batch of such books from Harlequin that I've read have been labelled Romance, when they're really Historicals. So from this point onwards, I'll open one of their books expecting only whatever I find, rather than what the label tells me I'll find. I suspect it will work much better. <br />Tallie's Knight is a case in point. The depth of characterization and scope of the plot clearly indicate Historical, and it is indeed a very delightful example of such. Anne Gracie is a writer to watch, as she definitely has the writing skills to match her knowledge of the period. An added bonus is her strong sense of humor, and the ability to infuse her writing with that humor. <br />One of the usual characteristics of the Historical novel is the inclusion of love scenes, and this book is no exception.  The plot is 'the marriage of convenience' which nearly always requires such episodes, but there is no indication anywhere that this book will contain a good many such, and some readers will no doubt be turned off by their presence. Actually, I think the book would have benefitted greatly from a bit of judicious editing here and there, as well. <br />Still, it is indeed an enjoyable book, although I was a bit put off by the extended travelogue portions, as well as the profuse daydreams of Tallie, the orphaned heroine. As governess to the children of her cousin, Laetitia, she is thus on the scene when Magnus, the Earl of d'Arenville (Laetitia's cousin from the other side of the family) surveys the young ladies duly presented by Laetitia, from whom he hopes to find his bride. Magnus doesn't really want a bride so much as hewants children; but to get the one, he must have the other. Not really knowing where to start looking for a suitable bride, he offers to foot the necessary bills if his cousin will host a house party, thus enabling him to inspect the young ladies--and be inspected, in turn, by their Mamas. He expects the resulting marriage to be a very businesslike arrangement; not for him the love match. He knew only too well the hazards of that emotion--he had only to look to his own parents for confirmation. <br />Of course, to the dismay of everyone, Magnus chooses Tallie for the warmth she displays while protecting her young charge Georgie and his puppy from Laetitia's wrath. This decision only magnifies Laetitia's wrath; consequently, in addition to failing to provide the bride-to-be with the proper bride-clothes, she also offers truly nasty instructions about bridal behavior to Tallie, who has no other, older, female relative available for such consultation. <br />The misunderstandings that arise from these instructions form a major portion of the plot, and Ms. Gracie handles these scenes with grace and wit--and believability, not an easy task. I look forward to reading many more books by this very talented author.	2001-05-24

Have you ever watched a movie or tv show or concert, and then afterwards read the review of it? And did you wonder, &quot;gee, did we both see (or hear) the same thing?&quot; <br />That's how I felt after reading this highly-praised and very recommended book. I adore this time frame--late 1300s, and really wanted to like the book. In all honesty, however, I have to say it didn't register with me as it has with all the other reviewers here. <br />I found very little medieval sensibility; oh, certainly they rode horses or used carts, and if anyone was dressing or undressing, the medieval name for the garment was mentioned, and sometimes a room in a building had an old-fashioned name--solar, for example. To me, the dialogue could have been in last week's movie, it was that modern, other than either an 'aye' or a 'nay' in every few paragraphs. <br />The characters also didn't seem very medieval in attitude or character; revisionist history doesn't work so well for me, and making them all sweet and lovely just doesn't get it. <br />The writing was some better than most first-time authors, but again, it was just too close to ordinary. There is certainly nothing offensive about this book--it just isn't one I can love!	2001-05-24

Or, maybe just to make trouble, at which he specializes with a capital S and a capital T, as well. Actually, he doesn't really need an excuse; he just likes to stir things up. And does he ever!<br />Jacobia Tiptree is the kind of clever, capable woman most other women would like to have as a friend, and when she hurts, you hurt, also. It doesn't take long in this book for Jacobia to be hurting in a big way. Used to standing on her own two feet, it never dawns on her that her best friend Ellie Carpenter is exactly the same kind of woman as Jake is herself, and the two of them together are formidable, indeed. <br />Except, of course, when Reuben's evil ways have been passed along to one of his disciples, who enlarges on them in his own unique fashion.  Jake and her new love Wade, her son Sam, her former husband Victor, her friends Ellie and George, plus many of the townsfolk appear in this book, and by the end, they'll all be your good friends, too. Or you'll wish they were, just because they're such wonderful people. Even Victor has some saving graces. <br />This is not a cozy novel, however, and if you prefer non-violent, non-graphic wickedness, then maybe you won't care for it as much as I do.

I say, there is this terrific novel that would make an absolutely smashing episode of MYSTERY or one of those type programs which you all do so well.  <br />Death &amp; the Princess--no, no! not *that* Princess--by Robert Barnard just cries out for a visual treatment. There's this hunky Scotland Yard Superintendent with a bit of Toff in his history somewhere there, and a name that could hardly be more Brit. Peregrine Trethowan. Now I ask you! Of course, he's married (aren't they all) and has a young son, to boot, so he wouldn't be up to much in the way of hanky-panky, but still--that gorgeous young man who played Mr. Darcy in your recent P &amp; P, would be ideal in this role. <br />Anyway, the Princess here is Helena, who is a many-times removed sprig of the current residents of Buckingham Palace, via her now-deceased Mama. Her Bavarian Papa, Prince Rupert, has managed to wangle himself into a position with the current Prince of Liechtenberg, and that entourage is about to visit London. This promises to create a bit of a stir, you see, because the Princess likes to have things happen. Especially when she's there to watch! <br />In her ordinary life, Helena is a charming young miss (rather reminds me of the second Miss Bennett in that aforementioned P &amp; P) who cheerfully carries out all the 'meet and greet' type tasks assigned to her by the higher-ups, in exchange for which she has a 'grace and favor' at Kensington Palace. Athough the Royals don't really specialize, as such, it seems as though Helena visits an awful lot of places that cater to the elderly, and does it cheerfully, too! <br />She even manages to have a private life, of sorts. There's that young, and supposedly Honorable Edwin Frere, and the Northern Ireland footballer Jimmy McAphee, the MP (from perhaps the wrong side of the aisle) Harry Bayle, and the current acting sensation, Jeremy Styles (who once did portray the aforementioned Mr. Darcy) in the current batch. Oh, and let us not forget the reporter Bill Tredgold. Unfortunately, he's no longer with us, having had a gas heater do exactly the wrong thing while he was staying at a Tudor era inn near Shrewsbury. <br />Well, there you have the cast of characters, except for a short star turn by Edwina, Lady Glencoe, that is. (You can read all about her on page 136 of the first edition.) There's even a bang-up plot that comes to light when a old lay-about mumbles something about a threat to the Princess. I think you really will have to read this for yourself, old chaps, to see just how it goes together so neatly. And such perfectly delicious political satire thrown in for good measure.

But by the time this fact was discovered, Camilla was promised to Lord Harry Summerton, and her conscience wouldn't let her do other than marry Harry. For thirteen years she was a happy wife, until the day Harry persisted in riding an untried horse known to be a rogue, and to attempt this folly in a thunderstorm. Of course, the horse promptly threw the rider, and Harry died instantly.

The Earl of Highnam is hopeful of a Marquissate, but scandal could derail his hopes, and anyway, William has been betrothed to Alice Penshill since little more than out of his cradle.

It's certainly easy to see how or why this book won the the St. Martin's Press Malice Domestic Best First Traditional Mystery Contest. The author rarely sets a foot wrong in this witty look at what can happen to one family in which there will be three weddings during one summer in Virginia. The characters are absolutely unique in their own way, but are lovingly patterned after those found in large families, complete with eccentrics and lovable elderly relatives and precocious kids.<br />Meg Langslow is the calm, sane one--the one everyone always turns to for help, only this time she may well have bitten off more than she can reasonably chew, as her idea of having a summer off from her welding/sculpting career lands her with the awesome task of wedding planner for the wedding of her Mom (the second time around, with suitable interference from Dad, who's still very much present); her brother Rob to Samantha (who nobody much seems to care for) and, finally her best friend Eileen, to Steven. Meg is also Eileen's maid of honor. <br />The village dressmaker, while on a visit to Florida, had some kind of accident, leaving her gorgeous son in charge. Of course, he's the most gorgeous unattached male in town, and Meg is instantly smitten, but rumors quickly put the cabosh on that relationship even before it can settle very firmly in her mind. Nevertheless, Michael does seem to be always somewhat nearby whenever Meg needs a helping hand. And as the first wedding day draws ever nearer, she seems to need several helping hands. <br />The small-town observations are dead-on, and the wry, witty voice of Meg as she describes the goings-on will have you laughing out loud when you're not just merely chuckling. <br />And the peacocks? You won't believe. You'll just have to read the book to find out for yourself. You won't mind it a bit.  Promise.	2001-05-11
US	50289674	RMDBTGHDYC1FO	0373511159	548950337	Dear Lady Disdain (Readers Choice)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Short on romance, long on enjoyment --	This is a wonderful and wonderfully complex story. The only problem with this book is that the publisher -- Harlequin -- chose to position it as a 'Regency Romance'. It most certainly is not that at all. Not even very close, in fact, which has probably hurt the book more than helped it. Another consideration is that this new paperback release is a reprint of a book first published in 1995. Standards have changed considerably in the years since then. <br />The story takes place over the course of a year, but the romance, in my opinion, is almost incidental to the plot. It is more the story of a young woman raised to be something that most women of the time were not allowed to be, and what happens to her and those all around her when she meets a man who has thrown over everything he was raised to be, in favor of becoming his own man, in another country.  There is a love story in here, to be sure, but I honestly don't believe it's the major element of the plot which is what really determines if a book is a romance or fiction. <br />As improbable as it might seem to some readers, there are those couples who, within a short time of their initial meeting, cannot resist the force of their attraction to each other, and can easily consider the world well-lost for love, or lust, if you will. Many of these couples will, in time, convert that electricity into something lasting; many, however, burn out, reducing each other to cinders in the process. <br />At a time in history when women were considered an adornment to their husbands, Anastasia Blanchard was born to a bank owned outright by her father. As his only child, and one who early on showed all the necessary signs of being exactly the type of heir he wanted, except for her sex, of course, he simply ignored that part of her, and proceeded to teach her everything he knew about banking. <br />Matthew Falconer, on the other hand, was the third son to an Earl, and without a mother to watch out for him, quickly became the target of his older brother. Matt left England, taking a small inheritance left him by his mother, and established himself in America. It made him a better man than ever the English system could have done. Unfortunately, the second son died in an accident, leaving Matt as heir apparent, a position he despised with every ounce of his large frame. In spite of his feelings about the title and all that went with it, when the older brother also died, Matt took himself back to England, to investigate an inheritance from an elderly aunt, who had loved him only for himself. <br />During a blizzard, Stacy and her travelling companions are forced to seek shelter at the ramshackle, run-down Pontisford Hall--Matt's legacy. Sparks are struck on their first meeting, and never let up until the last page. I enjoyed every page of this book, for its picture of a woman's non-world in Regency England, as well as the way in which families encircle and protect their own--even those hardly worth protecting, even long after the death of a worthless heir. If you read it as fiction, you should enjoy it, too. It just isn't much of a romance, although there is certainly a terrific amount of sexual attraction between the two most admirable lovers.	2001-05-08

Cristabel is determined to be a *true lady* just like her English mother; but, unfortunately, there is an obstacle in her way. Her father is a pirate.  It's little wonder, then, that at the age of twenty-one, the young woman left motherless at an early age, and having been taught lady-ness by a succession of governesses, not to mention piracy by a vast assortment of her father's henchmen, has decided never to marry thus never putting herself in any man's hands.<br />Her father, the infamous Captain Whiskey, facing impending retirement from the 'trade' and tired of being a bachelor, has plans to marry again, and everyone knows two women can't live under the same roof.  He orders Cristabel to select the type of man she wants to marry, pirate or not, and he'll fetch him.  Thinking to stymie the wily old buccaneer, she says she'll not marry any other than a fine, refined English lord.<br />Cristabel cannot then find any way out of marrying the young man her father promptly produces for her--Magnus Titus, Viscount Snow.  Immediately following the piratical-type wedding ceremonies, the newlyweds are hustled on board one of her father's ships, bound for England, and in almost no time at all, the old man's carefully laid plans fall apart.<br />To begin with, the captive is *not* Magnus, but Martin, the younger brother of the viscount--and already married to his childhood sweetheart, Sophia.  Declaring a vow of friendship, Cristabel and Martin share a cabin--platonically--during the crossing, and eventually, even to their arrival at Martin's home, where she meets the *real* lord.<br />Magnus is a hero to whom you will absolutely lose your heart--big, handsome, intelligent, honest, brave, trustworthy.  Cristabel is not immune, but doesn't trust him--or herself.  Surprises abound in the adventure-packed pages of this delightful book, peopled with pirates and lordships, bawds and ladies, who engage in attempted murder, society doings and other skullduggery.

US	50289674	R3EBE94QHINO1W	0449007057	251859595	Slow Dissolve	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A triple feature, at the very least --	Many authors write more than one series; some even write in more than one genre. I'm personally delighted that Della Borton started this second series known as- A Movie Lover's Mystery. I tried several times to read her first series, but it just didn't ring my bell, so I gave up. Not so this one, however. I was hooked after about five pages of the first book, FADE TO BLACK, enchanted with FREEZE FRAME, and am totally captured by this third one, which I'll happily rank as one of the best books of 2001 -- in any genre. In fact, I'll go so far as to say that if you can read chapter 42 without shedding a tear, 'you're a better man than I, Gunga Din', and you should be auditioning for the part of Hard-Hearted Hannah in Pete Kelley's Blues.<br />This book is a total package, in my opinion. The characters, many of whom we've met in the earlier books, are well-drawn and very believable in their actions. The plot of this book is multi-faceted, always including the famous Liberty family, well-known to the world because of their ubiquitous history in American film. In addition to the mystery element, the author also delves into the mysterious world of the Alzheimer's patient and the disastrous effect of the illness on those close to the patient, as well. An added bonus is the wonderful tribute to the early 'race' movies. As the Blacks from the South moved northward, many of them wanted to see movies featuring Black actors and other artists. An entire genre developed to feed this desire, and despite its popularity and the many stars it produced, it is still considered almost a step-child of the so-called 'real' movie industry. <br />Gilda Liberty has returned to her family hometown of Eden, somewhere in southwestern Ohio. The Libertys were among the founders of the American Film industry, and since the very first of them, in the early 1900s, they've all been named for early film stars. In spite of the author's excellent descriptions and character studies, I'll bet you'll stillfind yourself conjuring up the appropriate mental image of Ollie and Douglas and Adele and Duke, to name just a few of the family you'll encounter. Gilda inherited the town's original movie theater, and is struggling to keep it going. <br />Imagine her surprise then, to discover yet another movie family - the Mayers of down near Dayton. She's never even heard of them, but will soon be nearly a part of their extended family, which will include Leo's first wife, a famous Black movie star, India Williams.  Leo, you see, has early-middle Alzheimer's, and can't remember very much, but he does remember Auggie, and desperately wants to talk to him. Or her. The problem is, Leo has no way to release his memories to help anyone try to find Auggie, much less to be able to tell anyone just who--or what--is Auggie. <br />When a serious accident happens to Styles, the female detective friend of Gilda, and several near-misses occur in or around the house now belonging to Leo and his current wife, Shirley--Gilda, Styles and a colorful group of friends work overtime trying to sort it all out. Along the way, we're treated to a very short dissertation on the deterioration of historic film, and the efforts expended by the Library of Congress to rescue these early films before they're all lost forever.  The sadness of this previously unrealized situation, (less than half the movies made before 1950 still survive) coupled with the horrors facing the Alzheimer's patient and his or her family are offset by the running joke of Aunt Clara wanting to make a filmed comeback, and the eagerness of nearly every Liberty family member to produce the script. This is a wonderful book -- truly, I cannot recommend it highly enough, unless, of course, you don't like old movies. If, however, you like crossword puzzles, there is a film-oriented treat in each book.	2001-05-02
US	50289674	R1VJK16BMEOU2C	0446606952	594608098	Royal Bride	Books	2	6	6	N	N	Regency-lite, that�s all.	Having been enticed into reading this book by the lovely cover, and the stated premise indicated by the title, I'd not progressed very far before wrinkling my brow and inspecting the spine of the book. The writing, while good, seemed very simplistic in style, and I thought perhaps it was for the `young adult'. But no, not that, apparently. Well, then, maybe an `English as Second Language' or `Beginning Adult Reader' book, all of which are necessary ingredients in the overall literacy program. But if so, I couldn't find any indication of it.<br />And then I encountered the two plot elements that I most despise in any romance novel. The young miss, just out of the schoolroom who positively enchants the sophisticated, older, usually, battle-hardened warrior, at least ten years older than the child--and--the child doesn't even come up to the top of his shoulder. Either of these are grotesque, in my opinion, and I could happily live the rest of my life without ever again encountering either of them in any book I might read.<br />And make no mistake about this `child' bride. She is constantly referred to as a child, at least during the first third of the book. What gives here, I wondered? At this point I read the reviews, and came to the following conclusion.<br />No one is perfect every time out, and that includes all authors of any longevity, even those with a huge backlist, and years spent on the best-seller lists.<br />Even Tiger Woods loses occasionally. <br />This book is just an aberration, so get over it, and go on to the next one.  I found more than enough indications that Royal Bride was indeed written by Joan Wolf, so that's not a problem for me. I'll still read her next one, no question.	2001-04-27

What a delightful historical mystery by the noted mystery author Robert Barnard, in his pseudonymous alter ego. He poses this question: What if Mozart had lived to a ripe old age and then found himself mixed up in murder? Actually, his Mozart is Wolfgang Gottlieb Mozart. The book opens with the death of George III and Mozart is encouraged by a patron to believe that the upcoming Coronation might just be a splendid opportunity for a new opera.<br />Along the way we meet persons already familiar to devotées of the time period: Lord and Lady Hertford, Lord Egremere, Lady Conyngham and more, including an absolutely spot-on interpretation of Prinny, himself, whose estranged wife, Caroline is, of course, coming home to be Queen, and dear Prinny is busy trying to discredit her.<br />It seems that Mozart stayed in England all these years, dut to having once performed for a much younger George III, who generously and misguidedly paid the young artist 50 guineas. Father Leopold Mozart decided there were better possibilities in England than on the Continent, so they stayed. Thus, Mozart's son is now teaching music near Leeds, his daughter lives elsewhere, and lucky sister Nannerl is back in Vienna. (After all, nothing English is nearly as good as anything German or Austrian.) Mozart and his theater manager have a running rivalry with the Italian composer Rossini and several Italian singers, and there are numerous running jokes (or puns) about subjects for the new opera. Mozart leans toward the Merry Wives Of Windsor (think about it a bit); Falstaff, that fat, old rake, or maybe even Don Giovanni or Il Matrimonio Segreto. In between are jokes about the real music (such as The Magic Flute), Masons, and other real or imagined titles.<br />Actually, the only confusing thing to me was the music mentioned. Some titles are accurate, while others are merely a pastiche, and it is sometimes hard to know which is which. The chapter titles are frequently titles of known music by the realMozart. Nevertheless, I truly enjoyed this book, laughing out loud on many occasions. It is a literate and witty murder/mystery, fantasy/Regency era novel, with much to recommend it!	2001-04-26

This third adventure is another fast-paced tour of Manhattan, an introduction to yet another musical mechanical marvel, and a welcome re-introduction to the Purdue Repertory Company. <br />Well, not theatrical repertory, just a most unusual group of friends, who seem to have, collectively, nearly every skill needed by the man or woman who is engaged in nearly any kind of activity, legal or otherwise. I'm not so sure I'd like to meet some of them, but for the most part, they're charming, gregarious, curious, and loyal to a fault. <br />This episode begins with a phone call. One of Thomas' older collector/restorer friends, Edna, is quite certain she's killed someone, and would like Thomas's advice. When he arrives at her flat, it's to discover that the dead is not dead after all.  Thomas still must go to the hospital however, as Frank the Crank has been beaten up. And the day isn't over yet, because when he arrives back at his own home, it's to discover an in-progress burglary attempt. <br />But this is no ordinary robber. Young Jitters Levitsky needs money to feed and house  himself and his grandfather, and having 'heard' that the Purdue apartment holds treasures, he invades. Clumsily. Thus, Thomas adds another to the company, for young Jitters is that rara avis, a synesthetic. Jitters sees the colors and pictures of the sounds of words and/or music. His name is derived from another condition, however, a tremor in his hands. But Thomas knows just what to do with this young man; take him to Edna, who's had a stroke, leaving her somewhat restricted as a music box repairwoman. Feeling totally useless, she wants to take the Midnight Special (a euphemism for suicide among the elderly) and solve a bunch of her problems all at once. Thomas won't hear of it. <br />But there's more! When Sarah, Thomas's estranged wife returns from a visit to her sister in Montana, she seems to have an extra long-lasting bout of jet-lag, which makes her more than usually cranky. The biggest problem of all, however, is the one-of-a-kind music box belonging to Rudolph Hartmann, whose wife Lettie was a famous sculptor before a particularly nasty form of dementia grabbed her. This box was to be her insurance policy, until it went missing, along with the terribly precious and equally fragile painting on silk that was inside it. <br />This is a wonderfully warm book, believe it or not. The plot defies neat encapsulation. If you're of a certain age, you'll rejoice in the cadre of older persons exhibiting spunk and knowledge and persistence and caring and all sorts of wonderful qualities as they band together to help solve this puzzle. This book deserves the very highest accolades from the Senior Citizens of the World! Not to mention readers of any age, anywhere, in search of a crackling good yarn, well told and well-written.	2001-04-22

Better late than never, however. It is certainly a book that can be read--and enjoyed--at any time of the year. There is the customary family get-together, new traditions (a tree in the house! an idea from Germany) as well as old ones (ringing the chapel bell once for each year since the birth of Christ, 1818 peals in all.) There is a sometimes irascible grandfather who longs to see his oldest heir married. And a mystery. Who is the young woman known as Serenity Adams?<br />The two cousins, Timothy Crawford and Felix Wayne are on their way to Christmas with their grandfather, the Earl of Brookindale, at Cheyney Park in the north of England when they come upon an accident. Of the three inhabitants of the carriage that has gone over the side of a hill, two are dead. The other, a young woman, has suffered a severe blow to her head, which has resulted in amnesia. Purely by chance, the young woman greatly resembles the imaginary fiancée the the young man have created for Timothy, in lieu of the real thing.<br />For Timothy is an enlighted young man, devoting many hours each day to the care and enlargement of his grandfather's business interests. Such activity has discouraged several young ladies in the past, so he has created the perfect example in Serenity. The young man is not at all looking forward to his grandfather's seventieth birthday party on Christmas Eve, at which time he'll have to confess his falsehoods. <br />But the young woman, not knowing her real identity nor where she belongs, dressed as she is in servant's clothing, agrees to accompany the men to Cheyney Park. This is as much to recuperate as to set in motion the inquiries that will hopefully find her own real family and allow her to go home once again. <br />In spite of not knowing who she is, what she is quickly becomes very evident: a young woman of quality. Timothy is soon head over ears in love with her, and hesitantly, she reciprocates, knowing full well the relationship may well have to be abandoned if she is not worthy to be a countess.<br />This is very much a feel-good book, and when the villain gets his comeuppance, you'll chuckle in spite of yourself. And probably shed a tear or two when a very young lady takes her 'turn'. An added enjoyable ingredient is the author's own variety of Regency slang, or language, not usually encountered in other books. All in all, a book that should live on for several more Holiday Seasons.	2001-04-22
US	50289674	R1IAB74RB3TRM2	1890208205	857882572	Dead Aim (Chris Klick Mysteries)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A lyrical trip to the high country --	I was drawn to this book because somewhere, there was reference to a musical background in the story. Well, the music is mentioned, certainly, but it is by no means a major player in the book. Nevertheless, I was certainly not disappointed in any way at all. <br />This book isn't exactly a mystery, and it isn't exactly a romance, nor is it exactly a western. It has bits of those genres, and also bits of southern gothic, techno-thriller, adventure, hard-boiled hard-edged 'mano y mano', and not a little bit of travelogue. In fact, the more I read, the more reminiscent the book became to a series by one of my favorite authors of all time--John D. MacDonald. The series, of course, is that colorful one featuring Travis McGee. <br />This is not to imply that Dead Aim is in any way a take-off on the Travis McGee books, even though Chris Klick, the main character of this book, is very like Travis in many ways. Size, temperament, inclination--an electic mixture of things that make him very endearing. Like most big men, he is basically a very gentle person, sensitive (remember this was originally published in 1988, written even earlier), and caring. He is also an outdoorsman, who appreciates nature and most living creatures, is not overly concerned with the acquisition of 'stuff', but one who won't take very much guff from anyone, either. And, he does know music. My kinda guy, entirely. <br />He has no fixed abode (no 'Busted Flush' for example) but house-sits in various locations, enjoying and guarding the properties belonging to his friend and sometimes partner, James Chandler Wilshire Lyel III. Lyel is even bigger, smarter and wealthier than Chris, whose income is derived from restoring royalties to 'lost' musicians. For a fee, of course. <br />As this story opens, Chris is in Idaho, watching a pair of mergansers, when his idyll is interrupted by Nicole Russell, whose husband has disappeared and she wants him back. Thus we're set off on a wide-spread search, in which an amazing amount of plot elements are developed, dropped, picked up, discarded temporarily, then picked up again. The wise reader will make a serious attempt to remember them all, because sooner or later, you'll come across them again. There is no such thing as a 'throw-away' line here, because everything is utilized to good advantage. Especially Idaho, itself. It cannot ever have been displayed in a more appealing fashion. Almost makes you want to call your travel agent. All in all, this was an extremely engaging book, one I suspect I'll re-read at some future point. But only after I've read the other two books featuring these lovable--but very dangerous--guys, all the while keeping my fingers crossed that the author is busily working on the next one!	2001-04-19
US	50289674	R2XVJZ6VSE4CC5	0451143469	919711183	Mally	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Plus ça change . . .	It's fun, I think, to read 'early' books by now-established writers. Have they changed? Has the genre itself changed? <br />MALLY was originally published in 1980 as a Regency Romance, and during the intervening decades, I think the genre has changed more than the author. Sandra Heath still writes with style and humor and strong descriptive qualities. The reader never has any difficulty in visualizing any scene, such is her skill.  Her characterization and plotting have not deteriorated one whit, either; in fact, by comparison to her most recent books, she's still very adept at both. <br />What has changed, however, is the genre of Regency Romance. In recent years, the relationship between the hero and the heroine, and how it develops, has become all-important to many readers. They want to know what is happening inside the minds of both leading characters, and don't like to be led astray by any additional characters who assume too much importance. If that's the kind of reader you are, then you'll probably not be as happy with this book as I was.  If, however, you can enjoy a bit of uncertainty, and rather more to the plot and pacing, not to mention a bit of wondering -- now just who IS she going to end up with here, anyway? -- well then, I would highly recommend MALLY as an enthralling reading experience. <br />Marigold St. Aubrey, née Berrisford, has been a widow for two years at the beginning of the story, and is not completely convinced that marriage to the dashing Sir Christopher Carlyon is the right thing for her to do. She does love him, but does she love him enough?  Chris, on the other hand, has no doubts, whatever. Mally and her mother have come to London, searching for Mally's sister, Maria, who has unexpectedly left their Welsh home, and her fiancée, Thomas Clevely. <br />Maria is nowhere to be found, but the Lady Annabel Murchison, daughter of the Earl of Hartmore, who was once thought certain to become the bride of Sir Christopher, is everywhere, making it very clear that she's not given up her hopes of that marriage. Into this mix, add the volatile Richard Vallender, who has returned from America to purchase Castell Melyn in the Breconshire town of Llanglyn, where Mally's family has lived for years. Richard's former cousin-in-law, Andrew York, who accompanies him, also plays a major part. As does the ghost of the Lady Jaquetta de Winter, cruelly imprisoned in the depths of the castell in 1485.<br />The plot and pacing are reminiscent of that other genre known as Gothic, as Mally fights to overcome her fear of the Castell, even as she cannot remember exactly why the fear exists. <br />Eventually, all the couples end up matched correctly, and even Mally's mother is satisfied. You should be, as well.	2001-04-18

As with the Bloodstained Egg Cosy, this was pure delight, and I am sure I am not alone in wishing for more, more -- more!!  <br />Once again, Lord Burford and his stately home, Alderly play a major role, this time because of the Earl's love for movies. He is especially fond of Rex Ransom, one of the talkies' first cowboy/action stars, and blithely offers Alderly as the setting for a proposed new movie about the English Civil War.  The Countess is not quite so certain about all this, but would never bespeak her husband. Further, it provides their daughter, Lady Geraldine, the opportunity to invite her two most amorous, and possibly serious suitors, the Olympian track star, Paul Carter, and the rather Bohemian painter, Hugh Quartus, to come stay for a week or so. <br />The producer of the film company, Cyrus Haggermeir, is delighted at the prospect of such a visit, even if he does have to put up with the writer of the original screenplay, Arlington Gilbert. And here, he'd thought he could re-write at will. Then, of course, there are secretaries (the sly Maude Fry) involved, as well. And finally, a long-lost cousin of the Countess, Cecily Bradsaw (as was), now Everard, and her current husband, Sebastian, recently from Australia.  <br />Well now, isn't this an interesting mix? And it is, too, but it gets far more interesting with the advent of the famous Italian actress, Laura Lorenzo, who has come to Alderly from London, because of a telegram she received from Cyrus-who doesn't recall having sent it.  And finally, we have Miss Dove, Jemima, that is, who has been engaged to catalog the library, but gets her dates mixed up and arrives a week earlier than expected. <br />A blizzard, an auto that runs out of petrol, a stolen motorcycle (carefully separated from the side-car first, however), and a local talent show all combine to produce a murder.  Thus we have not only the delightful Inspector Wilkins and his trusty Sergeant Leather to investigate, but -- (fanfare, please!)  St. John Allgood of the Yard.  One of the Three Great A's, the other two being John Appleby and Roderick Alleyn, no less! <br />Allgood is rather full of himself, and needs to be taken down a peg or so, and in spite of himself, Wilkins is just the man for the job. One after the other, Allgood makes a case for each of the inhabitants as first murderer, only to have the case crumble around him. Surprises tumble all over each other, presenting laughs galore before the final, final  dénouement. Hardly anyone is quite who or what they seem, and my best advice is to not only read the book, but be sure to pay special attention to the prologue.  Marvelous.  More!  More!	2001-04-17

My own particular favorites of her large list of books are the ones featuring the operatic soprano/part-time detective Emmy Destin, with a little help from Enrico Caruso and other such notable luminaries of the time.<br />The books in which she incorporates her theatre background would stand out for that reason alone, (to me, at least) even if they didn't possess all the other star qualities necessary to produce a first-rate, entertaining book. <br />This quirky book is no exception, with former stage director Gillian Clifford, now a theatre-museum director, as the main protagonist. In her younger days, she had been married, all-too-briefly, to Stuart Decker, younger brother of the renowned venture capitalist Raymond. Stuart was the victim of a hit-and-run driver. The male Deckers, along with twin sisters, Michelle and Annette, comprise the current generation of a Boston family, which will immediately bring to mind other noted New England families, in more than one respect.<br />Raymond and his wife Connie, had one son, Theo; Annette, married to Tom Henry, a son, Ike; Michelle, married to Rob Kurland, Raymond's partner, had two sons, Bobby and Joel. Uncle Oscar and Aunt Elinor Ferguson had a daughter, Lynn. Theo had been the first to die, some years earlier, during a botched kidnapping attempt. But now, just in the last three months, Ike, Bobby and Lynn had all died, too, in apparent accidents. The final death was Raymond himself, in a fire at his home on Martha's Vineyard.  &quot;Whom the gods smile upon . . .&quot; <br />While reading her Chicago newspaper, Gillian stumbles over the death notice for Raymond, and is compelled to travel to Boston, to re-visit the family of which she was once a member. The family, however, thinks differently.  Once a Decker, always a Decker. In many more ways than one, it would appear.<br />Connie thinks Raymond was murdered, and in a short time, convinces Gillian toagree with her. From then on, it's no holds barred, as Gillian allies herself first with one, then another of the Deckers to get to the bottom of this murderous marry-go-round. Delicious!	2001-04-13

Sebastian Whitbury is the third of the Whitbury boys to have his own book, and as most siblings are different from each other, these books differ greatly also. <br />Dressed all in black, patrolling the banks of the Severn River, watching for the signal he's been awaiting for several days, Sebastian rescues a toddler who's tumbled over the edge of the cliff, landing on a ledge a couple of feet down.  Little Oscar Deems has awakened in the night, and gone wandering. When his mother, the widowed Charlotte discovers he's missing, and goes to look for him, she encounters Sebastian, thus putting herself--all unknowing--in the midst of the smuggling scheme.<br />Charlotte and Sebastian are a delightful couple as their hopes and dreams are illuminated to us and to each other. He longs to be touched, hugged, caressed; she wishes her husband had been more loving, more demonstrative. Of course, Sebastian has already chosen his wife, and it isn't Charlotte. His nominee is the beautiful Natalie Talbot, whose father doesn't agree with Sebastian's choice. Charlotte, on the other hand, has already decided she'll not re-marry. Once was enough. <br />In and around local cricket matches and practices (Sebastian is the leader of the local effort) the two loners become friends, and then allies. And, in what is surely the first 'free-agent signing' in Regency lore, Sebastian is hired by three local, wealthy townsfolk  to found the Gloucester Cricket Club. He'll actually earn a small stipend for doing what he loves most, other than being loved, that is. But Charlotte, who uses an extremely welcome amount of common sense in solving several problems, not least the smuggling, will solve that problem, too.  <br />This is indeed a very different, but very enjoyable book, with a little bit of everything in it. It should please any reader.	2001-04-13

My own particular favorites of her large list of books are the ones featuring the operatic soprano/part-time detective Emmy Destin, with a little help from Enrico Caruso and other such notable luminaries of the time.<br />The books in which she incorporates her theatre background would stand out for that reason alone, (to me, at least) even if they didn't possess all the other star qualities necessary to produce a first-rate, entertaining book. <br />This quirky book is no exception, with former stage director Gillian Clifford, now a theatre-museum director, as the main protagonist. In her younger days, she had been married, all-too-briefly, to Stuart Decker, younger brother of the renowned venture capitalist Raymond. Stuart was the victim of a hit-and-run driver. The male Deckers, along with twin sisters, Michelle and Annette, comprise the current generation of a Boston family, which will immediately bring to mind other noted New England families, in more than one respect.<br />Raymond and his wife Connie, had one son, Theo; Annette, married to Tom Henry, a son, Ike; Michelle, married to Rob Kurland, Raymond's partner, had two sons, Bobby and Joel. Uncle Oscar and Aunt Elinor Ferguson had a daughter, Lynn. Theo had been the first to die, some years earlier, during a botched kidnapping attempt. But now, just in the last three months, Ike, Bobby and Lynn had all died, too, in apparent accidents. The final death was Raymond himself, in a fire at his home on Martha's Vineyard.  &quot;Whom the gods smile upon . . .&quot; <br />While reading her Chicago newspaper, Gillian stumbles over the death notice for Raymond, and is compelled to travel to Boston, to re-visit the family of which she was once a member. The family, however, thinks differently.  Once a Decker, always a Decker. In many more ways than one, it would appear.<br />Connie thinks Raymond was murdered, and in a short time, convinces Gillian toagree with her. From then on, it's no holds barred, as Gillian allies herself first with one, then another of the Deckers to get to the bottom of this murderous marry-go-round. Delicious!	2001-04-13

Problem is, most of us haven't yet figured out how to communicate with her. We're not so fortunate as Lori Shepard, Dimity's niece.<br />This is the sixth adventure of Dimity and her niece, and if you've not read at least the first one, AUNT DIMITY'S DEATH, you'll probably be at least a tad confused by the events in this book. Once you've read the first one, however, I think the other books may be read in any order you come to them. They're all positively delightful.<br />Lori Shepard has, since the first book, acquired not only a husband and twin toddlers, but also a home in England. However, she still works infrequently for her former employer, the American Stan Finderman. Lori's specialty is old books, and evaluating them, and as a rule, it's great fun to tag along with her as she lovingly investigates various collections.<br />This time, though, she may have made an un-wise decision, as the collection is in an old (not ancient) neo-Gothic castle--Wyrdhurst--in Northumberland. As Lori approaches the place at night in a treacherous storm, her Land Rover slides off the path, just moments after Lori has voluntarily parted company from it.<br />She is rescued by the perfect hero, Adam Chase, except that, of course, she already has her own private hero. Adam is conducting his own search in the area, and it takes all of Aunt Dimity's skills to help solve a puzzle dating back to the early days of World War I. This is very nearly the perfect book: romance, adventure, history, mystery, fantasy--all combined in one well-written story. What else could anyone want?	2001-04-01

It is such a trick to not go too far when writing satire, and I have yet to observe him putting a foot wrong. This somewhat elderly book is no exception.<br />Somewhat elderly, because it was first published in 1986, a lifetime and a half ago, when it comes to politics, in Britain--or the US! None of the higher-ups are named in this book, so it's a safe read, anyway, except for the damage you may do to yourself by laughing too hard!<br />The Tory MP for East Bootham (a dreary little place that is a casualty of the economic wars and located in far Yorkshire) James Partridge by name, has apparently committed suicide by jumping off a bridge into the Thames. Or did he?<br />Mixing the events taking place behind the scenes leading up to the new by-election for Partridge's replacement with the very subtle investigation of his death by the about-to-be-retired Superintendant Sutcliffe of the London Police, allows the reader to see many sides of what could be a one-dimensional picture. There is also, of course, the ever present media, digging ever deeper into backgrounds and foregrounds.<br />In the end, the Superintendant solves the puzzle, which will leave you chuckling as you finish the tale, even though justice is probably not well-served.  But then, this IS about politics. Remember?	2001-04-01

How fortunate for his many readers!<br />I was vividly reminded of some of the antics of the long-ago 'Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight' by many of the happenings in this book, although it almost totally dissimilar. Such a contradiction! But it's true!<br />Mrs. Pargeter's late lamented was well-loved and respected by nearly everyone with whom he came in contact. It must be said, however, that most of those folks were on the shady side of the law.  It was Mr. Pargeter's opinion, that whatever one did, one should do well, and so, for instance, he sent his 'driver' to school to learn those extra little tricks which can make all the difference in a getaway.  He has also left Mrs. P. very well provided for--not only financially, but also with a wide variety of useful personages. <br />One of these is the builder, Concrete Jacket (shades of Damon Runyon in the naming of these characters!) who has undertaken to build Mrs. P.'s dream house. Unfortunately, a visit to inspect the progress quickly turns into a nightmare when a body is found in the proposed wine cellar. <br />Through the efforts of the hotelier, Hedgeclipper Clinton; the driver, Gary (such a plain name for such a talented young entrepreneur); Truffler Mason, the private investigator, and his secretary, the much-divorced Bronwen, a nasty scheme is unraveled just in time to prevent mayhem on a major scale. <br />Mr. Brett is a master of parody and satire, carefully balancing at the edge of the abyss, but never going overboard.  He leaves that plunge up to the reader, who, after one book, is never quite satisfied, but must embark on a longer voyage through half a dozen or more of his many books before becoming sated.	2001-04-01

The problem with this book isn't the fault of the author or the book itself. Rather, it is the insistence of the publishing industry that each book must fall into a perceived category. If it doesn't--oh, well, too bad! Once upon a time, a book was a book. If it was really fiction, costumed or otherwise, it could be fiction. It didn't have to pretend to be something other than what it was. These days, however, if a book is perceived to be of interest primarily to women, it must therefore be a 'romance'. <br />The existence of a love-story in a book does not necessarily make it a romance novel. EDUCATING EMILY is a novel about just that--the education of Emily that will help her become the wife and mother and marchioness that she needs to be, now that's she's married. There's hardly any 'romance' as such, anywhere. There is good writing, however, with well-defined characters, lots of workable plot, and a strong sense of the social ills of the period. <br />Emily and her brother Miles have been left adrift by the accidental deaths of their parents. Neither are really old enough to be on their own, yet, that's where they are. Miles falls under the spell of an aging gambler who has seen Emily and wants her for his own. Emily has other ideas for her future and they don't include Lord Ruysdale. Accompanied by her maid, Emily runs away, having had the forethought to exchange identities. <br />When James Garwood rescues her from an attempted abduction, he has no idea that he has just met his future wife. He offers little resistance when his mother recognizes Emily and proposes the marriage to solve numerous problems. Having not had the counsel of her mother about such things, Emily enters the marriage extremely ill-prepared to be a wife, even though she dearly loves her husband. <br />The characters do grow throughout the book, although not always as rapidly as the reader might wish. I found it to be an enjoyable look at the life of a family in Regency England, albeit one with a social conscience probably not often found in reality. The reader who wants more of a relationship type story will quite possibly not enjoy this book as much as I did.	2001-04-01

Now, let me see.  Was it the Earl of Burford in his collection-room with a candlestick? Or maybe it was Mrs. Peabody in her boudoir with one of her husband's weapons. Naw.  More likely it was -- just who was it, anyway?  I know! It was the Baroness out in the carpark with her trusty spanner. <br />For certain, there are laughs on every page--nearly every line, in fact, of this delectable, delicious parody of the classic 1930s-type English Country House Mysteries. Mr. Anderson has done his homework wonderfully well; the settings are absolutely spot-on, the characters a delightful mélange, and the plotting is, quite simply, to die for!  And of course, someone does just that. <br />The twelfth Earl of Burford, current resident of Alderley, a medium-sized stately home, is Britain's foremost collector of firearms--all sizes, all kinds.  For several years, he has been corresponding with Hiram Peabody, who is America's foremost collector. When the Peabodys decide to stop off in Britain for a look around, well, naturally, they would go visit the Earl and his Countess. <br />The earl has a daughter, Lady Geraldine and a younger brother, Richard Saunders, who has been making his way steadily upward in the diplomatic service. Into this family enclave comes Jane Clifton, a schoolfriend of Gerry's, Giles Deveraux, a retired Navy man, now writer who has been commissioned to do a book on stately homes, and a brace of diplomats from an unnamed Duchy on the continent. Richard and a gentleman from the HO are to negotiate a support treaty with the representatives of the small country. <br />Of course, Peabody has a secretary, and the care of Alderby is in the capable hands of Merryweather, the butler. And then, when her car has a sudden accident, the Baroness de la Roche is added to the mix, creating merry mayhem for all concerned. Well, maybe not merry for everyone.  But for you, as reader, most assuredly. You can't go wrong with this slightly loopy and very loving modern-daylook back at a treasured convention of the past. Clues, indeed. They're all over the place, just waiting for the 'not-at-all-sanguine' little gray (or whatever colored) cells of Inspector Wilkins to winnow them down to those precious few that will really solve the marvelous puzzle, even to the bloodstained egg cosy of the title! Simply amazing, and totally awesome!	2001-03-15

How does it happen I'd never even heard of you until a month or so ago, when I've been devouring mysteries (especially well-written, intelligently-plotted ones) for some forty years now?  (Oops, probably shouldn't have said that, but--it's only too true, so why not?)  <br />My first acquaintance with Penny and Toby was in 'Lament for a Lady Laird'--the title having caught the eye of this devoted Anglophile. I was immediately caught up in the adventure of Dr. Penny Spring, an anthropologist, and Dr. Tobias Glendower, archeologist.  One is almost tempted to add the word 'extraordinaire' after each occupational designation, for such they are. <br />Penny, an American occupied at Oxford as a teacher, is a widow of perhaps 50-something, with a 30 year-old son, Alex, who is scheduled to join her for a holiday in her adopted country, now that he's a full-fledged medical doctor, about to take up his practice in New York City. <br />Before his arrival, however, she is queried for the whereabouts of her fellow teacher, Toby. Scotland Yard is most desirous of his presence, immediately if not sooner, because of a murder at the Brighton Pavillion, during a reception for the visiting troupe of Russian ballet stars.  The suspected ballerina, Sonya Danarova, will speak ONLY to Sir Tobias, which has quite flummoxed Inspector Grey, the man in charge.  <br />Toby, in a blue funk, as happens not infrequently, is off in Wales, excavating a cave, known locally and elsewhere as Toby's Folly, a location as secretive and nearly inaccessible as the moon.  Eventually, he is found, and prevailed upon to return to England and in Brighton, finally, meets up with Sonya, who is the daughter he never knew he had. <br />Although no year is mentioned, if Sonya is in her late twenties, and Toby was last in Russia in the late 50s, then this story quite obviously takes place in the mid to late 1980s, when spies and espionage were still very much apart of every day life. <br />The characterizations are wonderfully realized, every one of them unique. The plot is perfectly sensible, and the writing will blow you away. Entirely. Although I've only read two of these books--so far--I wasn't thrown off pace or made to feel I'd missed anything by not reading the stories in order.  I can guarantee it won't be long before I visit once again with Penny and Toby and share another of their adventures.  What a treat to find an intelligent couple of a certain age, who have a wonderful working relationship, get along well together, and who also function well when they're apart. They are, moreover, a straight couple who have apparently never had the slightest inclination to fall into bed together. Extraordinaire, indeed!	2001-03-12

Especially when they would appear to be total opposites to each other in every respect. Height would seem to be the only commonality between Rachel Barton and Yves St. Armand.<br />A good bit of this story is set in Yorkshire, the home of Rachel, who is a mill-owner with advanced ideas about the welfare of her workers. Because of her height and plain face, she has given up on the idea of a husband and children, until the Earl of Fairborne becomes enraptured with her--and her fortune. He works hard at convincing her that she should become his countess, even going so far as to bring her to London for a visit. <br />It is here, in the earl's house, at midnight, that Rachel first meets Yves, who has entered the earl's bookroom searching for evidence against a traitor to the English cause. Yves is a secret agent who has determined to seek revenge for the death of his French fiancée, as well as many British soldiers. In spite of himself, he is drawn to the intelligent, dowdy woman who finds herself drawn into the search for the traitor. <br />This is a very satisfying book, longer on adventure than romance, which is not a bad thing. The characters are very believable and if Rachel was a bit before her time, well--there have been many others in that position as well.	2001-03-09

In this inventive novel, three distinct voices unveil several family secrets. Although each of the voices may briefly overlap here or there, they do not generally tell the same portion of any given episode of the half-century or so history of the Lomax family.       <br />Georgina was the daughter of the house, with two brothers, Edmund and Freddie. Ada Pepper went into the family's service when not much older than either Miss Georgina or Master Edmund, and so they remained to her for as long as they all lived. Freddie, unfortunately, was the first victim in the family, at the age of five, just about the turn of the century. <br />The entire family saga unfolds in the interweaving of these three narratives, from little Freddie's death; through World War I; Georgina's marriage, her lovers, and the subsequent death of her husband; the death of the Lomax father; the return of Ada's long-lost love; Edmund's unrequited love. Each segment, no matter how brief, sheds light on the history as it unfolds to the stunning dénouement. <br />The writing is simply superb in maintaining the three separate voices. You won't soon forget having met the Lomax family.	2001-03-09

Many a fortune has been lost on the turn of a card, and the Regency era knew its share of such happenings.  Tom Cherington has been busy losing his, mostly to one Lord Rowe, and when Tom finally observes the older man cheating, and then accuses him, naturally this leads to a duel. Knowing he's not any better a marksman than he was a gambler, Tom begs his best friend, Kit Highclare, to marry Louisa, Tom's sister, should the worst happen. Then Tom writes Louisa, asking her to marry Kit to secure her future.<br />Louisa has been employed as a governess to eight-year-old Emma Lawrence, but when Emma's older brother Geoffrey returns from his Army duty, he decides he wants Louisa, but not as his wife. Of course, the second Lady Lawrence has other ideas. She wants Emma sent away to school, which will remove the need for a governess, and then she can have the dashing young Captain all to herself.<br />Kit Highclare, heir to the Earl of Redway has considered himself in love with Thea Rowe, wife of the same Lord Rowe who has cheated Tom of his meager fortune.  When Thea refuses to leave her husband to elope with Kit, he grudgingly agrees to marry Louisa, if --<br />Of course, the duel goes badly for Tom, who does at least manage to wound Rowe in the arm before he falls. Keeping his promise, Kit seeks out Louisa and asks her to marry him, and she agrees, knowing she has no other choice but this hastily-arranged marriage of convenience.<br />Gossip being the second most favorite occupation of the ton, tales begin to fly. Louisa and Geoffrey, Kit and Thea--all grist for society's gossip mills. Kit, who has against all his teachings, carried on an affair with a married woman thinking himself truly in love with her, now finds himself thoroughly jealous of  Louisa. He's falling in love with her, and wants her all to himself. Unfortunately, these tempting little tid-bits of gossip keep falling in his ear, leading him to believe what he doesn't want to. And at the same time, of course, he thinks he can continue to see Thea, even if in an innocent way, while in actuality, that won't work either.<br />Louisa is no milk-and-water miss, however, having a well-developed sense of honor which precludes her from acting in a hypocritical way.  She gives as good as she gets, startling--and embarrassing--Kit, and prompting him to keep her in seclusion at the family home on the Isle of Wight.  Duty is served, but behind the scenes shenanigans keep the pot well stirred, as honor begins to lose the battle to gossip. In the end, all comes right, but it's a near thing, as finally, the two confess their love for and to each other.<br />As usual this gifted author has gone beyond the ordinary London settings by taking us to the Isle of Wight for a summer regatta in the Solent between Southhampton and the island. You'll chuckle at the humor-laden references to the wardrobe so hurriedly put together for Louisa, in this unusually complex, yet very traditional---and very enjoyable--Regency novel.	2001-03-05

My only complaint (and the reason for four stars instead of five) is that it is just simply too big for one volume. It's chock-full of wonderful information presented in a very accessible manner, in which any fan of the GoldenAge mysteries would be interested. How much nicer it would have been for the reader (not to mention easier to hold!) if it had been done in two or three volumes. Granted, it might not be possible to do as thorough a biography of a newer author as was the one of Agatha Christie, (74 pages) but many of the newer authors are deserving of more than a brief paragraph. At least in my opinion they are. This book, however, is more of an encyclopedia in one volume than a 'sit down and read' type of book. <br />As it is, this book is divided into three primary sections: In the Beginning  presents Anna Katharine Green and Mary Roberts Rinehart. I'm not sure I'd ever heard of Green, but have certainly read many of the Rinehart books, and I found it very enjoyable to learn a bit more about this nearly-indomitable author, who certainly paved the way for many of her followers. The second section--A Golden Era--presents the five doyennes of that time: Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Ngaio Marsh, Josephine Tey and Margery Allingham. In addition to a biography, which provides a bit of info (explanation or background) for nearly every title in each author's canon, there is a wonderful reference list included that not only includes the books by year published, but also mentions the US and UK publishers, and even those books with alternate titles for each country. There is also mention (when applicable) of film and television versions, plus mention of any biographical works devoted to the author. <br />Third--Modern Motives--are smaller tributes to Patricia Highsmith, P. D. James, Ruth Rendell, Mary Higgins Clark, Sue Grafton, Patricia Cornwall, Minette Walters, Emma Lathen, Margaret Millar, Lilian Jackson Braun and Anne Perry.  A final few pages devotes a paragraph or so to some seventeen of today's mistresses of mayhem.  <br />The concluding pages are occupied by a chronology, references and resources and very comprehensive index. This is a BIG book, but I can't help thinking that a 468 page reference work devoted to women mystery writers in which Charlotte Armstrong and Dame Daphne de Maurier are relegated to a footnote each, is definitely in need of being two volumes. Or even three! We can but hope.	2001-03-01

Mrs. Hurst Dancing (the title taken from one of the sketches in this charming book) will open the doors to the English Regency period, especially the years 1812-1823. <br />Diana Sperling was born in 1791 and lived with her parents, brothers and sister at Dynes Hall near Halstead in Essex. Until she married in 1834, she indulged her quite considerable sketching and water-coloring talent in delightful vignettes of every day life. Sadly, she seems never to have painted after her marriage. <br />This loving and sometimes humorous glimpse of day to day family life displays sister Isabella rolling off her donkey (which was apparently a frequent happening) to brother Harry tumbling off his colt. The informal sketches also illustrate the family while dining, playing chess or charades and hanging wallpaper, yet also spending a good bit of time in the outdoors, engaging in donkey races or riding parties, and admiring those members of the military who visited in the area. They also walked a good deal, in the mud and the rain and even the snow. Diana captures her friends and family at play and at work; at home and elsewhere.<br />The paintings were kept by Diana in her sketchbook, as she painted them, on the right-hand page; the left was used for comments and captions. Seventy of them are reproduced in this book in their actual size, somewhat larger than miniatures, but certainly not large in scale. Most of them are 5½ by 6½ or 5½ by 7 inches. There are a few which have obviously been cut from another page and glued down. While most of the captions are in her own handwriting, there are a few written by another, with explanatory additions by Gordon Mingay.<br />In some fashion, the two sketchbooks came to be in the possession of a distant relative, a Miss Silver. She, in turn, gave them to her lifelong friends, Mr. and Mrs. Neville Ollerenshaw of Chichester. Those of us who love the Regency era have cause to be grateful to the Ollerenshaws for not only maintaining their treasure but being willing to share it with the rest of us.	2001-02-19

In the years since we all watched the splendid BBC/A&amp;E production of Pride and Prejudice, have you ever wondered what might have happened after that gorgeous double wedding? You're not alone. This delightful book presents one such scenario, which takes place four years later. <br />All is serene at Pemberley Great House, as it is referred to by the inhabitants of the area, until the night when Dr. Robinson, aged eighty-seven, who had been Rector of Pemberley for more than fifty years, passes on to his reward, peacefully, during his sleep. It is this traumatic event which opens the doors to a summer of upheaval in the lives of 'Fitz' and Elizabeth Darcy.<br />Of course, a new rector must be found, as soon as possible; but first, poor Darcy must convince the two elderly, maiden daughters of the good reverend that they must find another place to live. But no! If he will only find a bachelor to fill the living, said bachelor can reside with them, and they will in turn keep up the house. From such a simple premise do great events transpire!<br />The Darcys are now parents of a two-year old son, Richard; Jane and Bingley have two daughters. Nothing is said of Lydia and Wickham. Mr. Bennet and Kitty, still unmarried, come to visit, as does Aunt Gardiner. Uncle Gardiner is unavoidably detained in London, investigating for Darcy. Georgiana, also unmarried, still resides at Pemberley; indeed, she cannot imagine living anywhere else.<br />Although we are not relieved of the company of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and her daughter, Lady Anne, we are thankfully spared the presence of Mrs. Bennet and, except for a letter from him, Mr. Collins.<br />After much behavior of the sort to be found in the Austen books, a happy resolution is achieved for nearly all. Kitty and Georgiana are no longer among the ranks of the unmarried, and even Lady Anne will find a spouse. (He even agrees to change his pedestrian name to de Bourgh, such is the lure of her vast inheritance.)<br />If nothingelse, this book, written nearly fifty years before the splendid film was even thought of, confirms the wonderfully appropriate casting of the film. Consider these lines: Darcy, speaking about his cousin, Francis Wakeford; &quot;...although Wakeford spoke of his desire for solitude, I became convinced that his need is for companionship.&quot; Or, when Elizabeth opens the door to a room where Darcy has been awaiting her, &quot;When she opened the door of his room, he was walking up and down as was his way if much perturbed. On seeing her he stood still and looked at her searchingly.&quot; Can't you picture it? And, what about Jane? &quot;Jane's time never seemed to be her own. Either one of her children or her husband, required her attention.&quot; While Bingley: &quot;...declared that for his part he never knew where he put anything and always had to ask Jane.&quot; And, lastly, of Lady de Bourgh herself: &quot;Unfortunately, Lady Catherine's usual spirit of contrariety did not on this occasion assert itself.&quot;<br />I've not yet read any of the other sequels to Pride and Prejudice, but I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the original book--or the film.	2001-02-19

According to the medical rules of the time, that is. Her strength was in the knowledge and use of herbs and other assorted items that could be blended together to cure--or at least treat--nearly every ailment known to man. If the medicaments as put forth at the beginning of each chapter of this book are as factual as stated by the author, I confess to surprise that not more of the Stillroom maids were cruelly murdered. Many of them were accused--rightly or wrongly--of witchcraft.<br />Of course, Tess Arnold was a bit more than just Stillroom maid to the household in which she was employed. Just how much more, became the problem facing Jane Austen in this, her fifth crime to solve. Jane, after all, had come across the mutilated body of the young person, dressed in gentleman's evening clothes, and with a bullet hole in the middle of his forehead. Imagine the surprise of everyone--including Jane--when the local coroner identified the corpse as not a young man, but--the Stillroom maid from Penfolds Hall.<br />Jane, her sister Cassandra and their mother, in the company of Edwin Cooper, the nephew of Mrs. Austen, and a vicar (who was clearly the model for Mr. Collins) visit Derbyshire in company with George Hemming, a gentleman friend of Edwin. The two gentlemen and Jane had gone trout fishing in the dales, providing the opportunity for Jane to have a little commune with nature, but resulting instead in the horrid discovery of the body.<br />Jane's 'Gentleman Rogue' Lord Harold has been invited to nearby Chatsworth (and model for Pemberly) the home of the Duke of Devonshire, some few months after the death of the first Duchess, Georgiana. The family has been devastated by the death of their leader, and are now trying to find their way again, when the surrounding area becomes inflamed by the death of Tess. Of course, it is the powerful Whigs who come under the most suspicion, as many of them are also members of the FreeMasons, an organization looked upon with much skepticism by the townsfolk. <br />There are twists aplenty before Jane puts all the pieces together and provides a solution, but not until after another death. It was The Stillroom Book, as kept by Tess Arnold that finally provided the necessary information for the Justice to secure his prisoner. In the end, however, Jane and Lord Harold must once again say good-bye, and we are left to hope they will meet again, thus providing us with further adventures.	2001-02-17

I opened this book absolutely confident that I would absolutely love at least one of the stories.  I closed it, delightfully surprised by the discovery that I truly enjoyed all three of them. With varying degrees of enjoyment, to be sure, but nevertheless I did like them all. <br />Leading off this 'stockingful of love and joy. . .' (as it says on the cover) is &quot;A Cache of Magical Kittens&quot; by Judith A. Lansdowne, the one I knew I would greatly enjoy. Which I did. No one--absolutely no one--does cats or kittens better than Ms. Lansdowne, and, once you've made the acquaintance of Mrs. Oakwood, I'm sure you'll agree. <br />C. Archibald Pope with his trusty mare, Feather, is on his way to becoming the tutor for the son of an old friend, when Feather stumbles, and the severe winter cold and snow almost does them both in. It's only the discovery of a litter of forlorn, nearly frozen kittens and their exceedingly bedraggled mother in a hollow tree that provides the inspiration and fortitude for Archie to continue his journey. Once he reaches Wyndhover, he meets his young charge, the six-year-old Viscount Wraithstone, who has not spoken nor allowed himself to be touched since the death of his father, some eighteen months prior. And, of course, the lad's mother, at her wit's end in the struggle to solve the puzzle of her young son. <br />A Cache of Magical Kittens is indeed magical in every respect, and you'll feel a warm wonderful glow when you've finished reading it.  No matter when you read it. I'm sure the magic will work just as well in mid-summer as it would in mid-winter. It certainly worked for me on Valentine's Day!<br />Mistletoe Kisses by Jeanne Savery was a major delight. A touch of Gothic, a hint of mystery,  a lost heiress, a soon-to-be Baron and a small kitten all combine to lead the reader through hidden passages in an old castle to hidden caves in the cliffs off  Cornwall, fighting off smugglers and other difficulties in order to find true love. Itall works wonderfully well, and you'll enjoy the trip as the two lonely souls, Grace Cheviot and Morgan St. Austell, fight off adversaries to gain each other, with the able assistance of Purrmew, of course. <br />Noël 's Christmas Wish by Donna Simpson, although the weakest of the three novellas (in my own opinion, that is) is still enjoyable. One could wish for a slighter emphasis on the stereotypical behavior of the characters, and also for slightly more archaic speech patterns in what is, after all, a historical story. (Late 20th century phrases pop out in the strangest places--a habit I've noticed in other books by this author.) The six-year-old Mossy is a tad too precocious, but charming and winsome in her longing for a real family--something she's never known, for her mother died in childbirth. When her father, Charles Montrose, brings her a kitten he's rescued, the tyke is overjoyed that he's remembered his promise, when in reality he doesn't remember any such thing. <br />Mossy and the kitten, who she's named Noël, wish on a falling star, and then set about to make the wish come true. The widowed Lady Ann Beecham-Brooke, known as Lady Ice to many of the ton in London, has no interest in assisting the wish to become fact, but finds herself accepting the hospitality of the Montrose family after her carriage suffers an accident. Helpless in the face of such a welcoming household, she is forced to confront the memories of her own unhappy childhood and marriage, until finally, she realizes she can indeed change not only her own life, but also that of Mossy and her father.	2001-02-17

I grew up in the country, in the days before there was much in the way of public transportation. Gasoline was rationed and it was expedient to think before blithely getting in the family car to go off joy-riding. How fortunate I was, then, for my family to have friends who owned motorcycles. Big, brawny men who rode big-brawny motorcyles. Indians and Harley-Davidsons were as much a part of my childhood as the family dogs, Bing and Chip. For two summers in the mid 40s, I even rode to Sunday School every week, on the back of a Harley. (Grandma didn't like that idea very much, but on the other hand, it got me there!) This lovely, splendidly-illustrated book brought back so many wonderful memories, especially the paintings of Dave Barnhouse, one of which adorns the cover, and is again featured on a double-page spread in the book. Another wonderful artist is James &quot;Kingneon&quot; Guçwa, whose paintings in a photorealistic style are so very real and lifelike that you want to reach out to touch those wonderful machines. <br />Other artists, either those who use words, or those with a camera are also represented in the 160 pages here. Some of the essays will bring smiles, or laughs, or even a wince or two at the reminiscences, especially if they blend in with--or even mirror--your own. Chapters are devoted to 'In the Beginning',  'Making History', 'On the Road', 'Daredevilry', 'Legends' and 'The Mystique'. Photos range from the early days of both photography and motorcycles, to eye-dazzling custom and even 'over' customized beasts. (Many with full technical specifications provided.) <br />Spending a few hours with this book is almost--not quite, but almost--as good as riding down the highway, the sun and the wind caressing your face (and sometimes its rain or snow!), the full-throated chugga-rumpety, chugga-rumpety of the exhaust echoing through your helmet.	2001-02-16

I've heard of folks who, when they finished a certain book (whatever they were reading at the time) started right back at the beginning and read it again. I've always wondered a bit about that, having never before been tempted to do so. Well, I now understand that compulsion, having just done this very thing, and I'm pleased to report, I thought this book was every bit as good the second time around! Not bad, because the first time I thought it was--quite simply--perfect!<br />In my opinion, it is the task of the author who writes fiction to engage the reader's attention on page one by that old premise 'what if --?'. Consequently, I believe the mark of the terrific author is for the reader, having completed the book, to say, 'it COULD have happened, just that way. I believe!'<br />In 99% of her books (at least those I've read) I find that Sandra Heath completely fulfills this pledge. BREAKING THE RULES is no exception, with its mixture of Welsh mythology (she is Welsh, after all), ancient Druid rites, the Roman settlements in Britain--all combined with perfectly logical events in the world of Regency England, and well-spiced with her usual humor. <br />(As an aside, I'd like to mention that during the Regency era and well into this last century, a popular family entertainment was reading a book out loud to/with the family in the evenings, usually after dinner and before bedtime. This book cries for such loving treatment, especially in the wonderful use of dialect. I found myself compelled to slow down and actually mouth the words I was reading, they're so lively and unique. Not everyone does this so well as Sandra Heath, unfortunately.) <br />Ursula Elcester is the daughter of a noted scholar, whose specialty is the Roman occupation of Britain, and in particular, that occupation of their little corner of Gloucestershire. Strange things have been happening in their little village during the last few months, and because of an unwise investment, her father has betrothed her in a marriage of convenience to the heir of the largest local land-owner, Lord Carmartin, said heir being one Theodore Maximilian Prince. This does not set well with Ursula, who'd much rather stay unmarried, but mindful of her duty to father and village, she grudgingly agrees. <br />Theo brings his best friend Sir Conan Merrydown to Elcester when he comes to make the acquaintance of his bride-to-be. Accompanying them is Theo's white wolfhound, Bran the Blessed, Son of Llyr, more commonly referred to as just Bran. Due to an upset with the horses, the two men (and dog) stay at the Green Man, where they encounter a mostly white squirrel, the new inn-keeper Bellamy Taynton, and Vera, daughter of the local blacksmith, now cook at the inn. <br />Suffice it to say that many pages and laughs later, there is a marvelously happy resolution to all the puzzles, and four very happily married couples. <br />BREAKING THE RULES is immensely satisfying, on every level, and should fulfill any reader's every expectation. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an intelligent book--one with romance, history, humor, and of course, fantasy.	2001-02-14

It might not be terribly relaxing, but if the stories set there are any indication, one would be treated to a beautifully decorated, very comfortable room; prize-winning cuisine; a cozy library up in the remodeled attic--and possibly a real-life mystery or two. <br />The previous books in this series have introduced us to Tess Darcy, the owner of Iris House, which was a surprise bequest. Not knowing what to do with it, she converted it into the B&amp;B, and has managed to fill it with various groups of intriguing and sometimes murderous clients. Along the way, she has become engaged to the handsome Luke Fredrik, added an apartment for them to the original house, and acquainted us with her staff and family--those who still live in Victoria Springs and her father's second family, now residing in France. <br />Of course, there is a somewhat bumbling chief of police who really doesn't like Tess very much, and who can blame him, when she's so much more intelligent and logical than he is?  Even so, Tess never comes across as a know-it-all; rather, more like a woman any other woman would be pleased to call 'friend'. Certainly, any woman in trouble would like such a friend. <br />As one might guess from the title, this book centers around the wedding of Tess and Luke. A bridal shower is being given at the country club, and when the officious master chef is found with his own butcher knife in his chest, everyone present takes a turn at being the main suspect. It's a near thing, though, for Gertie Bogart, the cook at Iris House. Finally, however, all the clues fall into place, and the wedding takes place as scheduled. <br />This reader hopes that marriage and a family do not spell retirement for Tess. At least, not until I can go spend some time there. I highly recommend Iris House for any reader of cozy mystery novels, especially, but I'm sure anyone would be made welcome!	2001-02-09

I looked. Nice cover, gorgeous step-back, (I like old houses) and then the ambiguity on the spine caught my eye. My library had catalogued the book as a 'mystery' but the publisher calls it 'romance'. That's only part of the problem I had with this book, which I did not finish--in fact, page 80 was the extent of my patience with it. I kept wanting something to happen. Almost anything would have sufficed. I freely admit to not ever having read anything by Brenda Joyce, although certainly I've heard of her. This book, however, didn't seem to know just what it wanted to be, and I really couldn't wait for it to grow up. Sorry.	2001-02-09

Although it probably would help to read the books in the order they were written, to better pick up on the characters and their lives, the author does an excellent job of bringing you up-to-date with them, rather quickly.<br />Leigh Koslow is a very ordinary sort of woman of today; approaching thirty, no steady guy, her own rather new business--and a mother. Lucky girl, her mother is a twin, and there is even another aunt, Bess Cogley.  The three sisters are as different from each other as it's possible to be, and thus exert strange influences over Leigh as she tries to live her life.<br />When Leigh is awakened by a call from the local hospital advising that Aunt Bess is in their custody and would like a visit from her niece, the fun begins. Aunt Bess, dressed as a biker chick,  suffering from smoke inhalation and a broken ankle, has another visitor when Leigh arrives--the minister from Bess's church.<br />Through a wide variety of clever ideas and suggestions, plus some not-so-clever, Bess and Leigh set out to investigate the background of Pastor Humphrey, whom Bess suspects is really a very clever con artist. Winding through the story are the members of Leigh's family and their assorted pets, plus the members of the church, and a former class-mate who might prove to be her soul-mate, if she can sort out her feelings quickly enough.<br />The minister disappears, and is eventually found--in the storage freezer at the animal shelter. Suspicion falls first on one person, then another, until finally, with a few surprises thrown in, the death is ruled natural. Other surprises follow, including an epilogue which attempts to explain some of the things that have happened. It seemed more like a short story appended to the book for the sole purpose of tying up loose ends. However, it didn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the book, at least to this reader.	2001-02-09

A mystery reader/fan must, every now and then, return to the books of the great Dame Agatha. Yet, it becomes harder and harder to find one that perhaps hasn't been read for a while. It's important also, not to get sucked into a recently read title now masquerading under a new name. <br />I'm sure that at some time in my past, I've read The Murder at Hazelmoor, but not recently enough to have given the subsequently-named The Sittaford Mystery a familiar aura. S'wonderful, indeed. <br />No one captured the thirties quite so eloquently as did Christie, and this book is a prime example of her art. There is no Miss Marple or Hercule Poiret in this episode, however. Rather we have an intrepid young woman named Emily Trefusis, who has the misfortune to be engaged to the nephew of a man who is found murdered, after his death had been exposed by a 'table turning.' This is a version of the Ouija Board, which was enormously popular in the first decades of the 20th century.  <br />Captain Trevelyan, who was rather fond of money, had been prevailed upon to let out his own Sittaford House to a widow and her daughter, apparently just arrived from South Africa. Never married, the Captain had few heirs: one sister and the three children of another, now deceased.  It is James Pearson, one of this latter group, who has captured the fair Emily, and finds himself in jail under suspicion of having done in his uncle. <br />Emily knows better, however, and with the aid and assistance of a live-wire newspaper reporter, Charles Enderby, sets out to prove his innocence.  Emily and Charles quite put in me mind of Tommy and Tuppence with their humorous bantering. (Perhaps they were the inspiration for Dame Agatha, as well.) <br />The prevalence and importance of trains and their schedules take one back to that time when almost no one owned an auto of their own, and walking twelve miles (round-trip, to be sure) for a visit was hardly any kind of bother at all.  If onewas fit, that is. <br />Village life along the moors is captured perfectly, along with the various eccentrics who reside there. It's a cracking good puzzle, with all the clues neatly laid out for the intrepid sleuth. A visit to Agatha Christie's England is good for us all every now and then. I'm looking forward to the next one!	2001-02-09

For whatever reason, all kinds of wonderful explanatory words kept running through my mind while reading this book. Rowdy, raucous, rascally. Rambunctious. Romp. Revenge. Even romance. Oh, there were a few others, most notably 'politically incorrect'. Or should that be 'uncorrect'? Whichever, it most certainly is that, too. However, it is also one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a long time. <br />Some of the people we encounter in our daily lives are so not-at-all-nice, it's truly enjoyable to see them brought down a few pegs. One could almost--almost, but not quite--feel sorry for Vincent LoPriore when he lands in the exceptional world of Thomas Purdue. Of course, had not Vinny (known as the Birdman because of his fondness for collecting musical automata featuring birds) perpetrated a gigantic fraud against one of Purdue's fellow collectors and long-time friends, Hugh Curtis, Vinny would not have placed himself in jeopardy. Trust me, this is not the tv version of jeopardy, either. (Aside here: this would make a WONDERFUL movie, however, being a very visual book. It virtually screens itself in the mind's eye of the reader.)<br />Another 'R' word is Runyon, as in the great Damon and his truly unforgettable characters. One might think that Larry Karp studied at the feet of Runyon, given his ability to create the same kind of memorable personages to tramp so blithely through the pages of his novels. Just the names alone go trippingly off the tongue, creating a smile on the reader's face:  Broadway Schwartz, Big Al, Frank the Crank, Cleveland Gackle (his real name!), Mick the Dick and Soapy Sandy, plus Nozey Espinoza and Fenton Dassidario (another real moniker).  And not least, two extraordinary women with ordinary names: Edna Reynolds and Sarah Purdue. <br />This is a rare adventure caper, sometimes raw, sometimes rollicking, and always realistic.  At least I think it is that latter, for I certainly have no exposure whatever to the world of Thomas Purdue, butI'm grateful to Larry Karp for letting me visit it occasionally.  <br />Scamming the Birdman is a rara avis, indeed. You won't be sorry if it comes into your sights, unless of course, you don't focus in on it.  Enjoy!	2001-02-09

I hadn't realized how long it had been since the last Beverly Jenkins novel I read, but it was certainly too long ago!  A most forcible reminder of that fact was brought home when I was but a few pages into this wonderful book. I've been struggling lately with the seeming oxymoron of 'historical romance'. The two words are not mutually exclusive, but it seems that more and more of the recent books have too much history (much of it inaccurate) for the romance readers, or too much romance for the lovers of history.  <br />What a treat it is to find a book in which these two elements are so inextricably melded together into one extremely satisfying whole. Beverly Jenkins improves with each book. Fact. Even though one would have thought that impossible, even when reading her very first book, &quot;Night Song&quot;.  <br />There is even more humor in Jessi Rose than I remembered from prior books, but it certainly added more lustre to the story of this intrepid young woman--determined to hold the family ranch in safe keeping for her young nephew, Joth--and the train-robber Griffin Blake, who is sent to help her. He doesn't want to be there, and she doesn't want him there, but there he is, and there he's gonna stay. Their battle of wits--and sharp retorts to each other--will keep you smiling long after the book is read. <br />Set in Texas in the 1880s, the plot is pure Western; the money-hungry land-grabber wants acreage he can't get legally, so he resorts to force. What makes it different is the history of Blacks in the United States after the War Between the States and the supposed emancipation of them. Laws are only as good as those who enforce them, making this topic as current as today's headlines. Then, as now, of course, it is the people themselves who make the difference, and the characters in this book will stay with you for a long time. Oh, and did I mention this book has one of my favorite plot lines? Slightly older woman/younger man, and it works beautifully here.<br />Where, oh where--is there a film/tv producer who would make this into a movie?  It would be an absolute smash hit, if it were faithfully recreated according to the author's delicious vision. Well, except perhaps for the love scenes, which, unless tamed down just a tad, might well move it right out of the family-type films of which we need more excellent examples. (Don't you think Hallie Berry would make an absolutely dandy Jessi Rose?)<br />Readers of romance and/or history owe a huge debt of gratitude to Beverly Jenkins, for having exposed a mostly previously-unknown world to the public eye. She deserves every accolade she's earned--and then some!	2001-02-04

Founded by Mary Cardwell Dawson, the company made its debut in Pittsburgh in 1941. This is but one of the fascinating things you can discover in this marvelous book. If you have an interest in music of whatever variety, your library is incomplete without this book.<br />This 3rd edition was done in 1997, thus it is quite up-to-date in its coverage of classical, jazz, rock, pop, gospel, swing, ragtime or blues. If it is music as practiced, performed or composed by people of color, this is where you'll find valuable information about it. Beginning with Africa and continuing to the present day, the four sections detail this rich history: Song in a Strange Land (1619-1775); Let My People Go (1776-1865); Blow Ye the Trumpet (1865-1919) and Lift Every Voice (1920-1996). The latter section is particularly informative reading with sections on Jazz, The Harlem Renaissance, and the Mid-Century Decades. It is these years in which artists of color finally took their well-deserved place on the musical stages of the world. Of course, they had been visible in their own world, and the popularity of such major composers as Scott Joplin and Duke Ellington  allowed them to more or less effortlessly cross-over to the 'white' world. Lena Horne, the Mills Brothers, Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway were--and still are--names to be reckoned with in any list of fabulous performers. <br />And then there was Marion Anderson who finally made her way to the Metropolitan Opera at the very end of her career, making way for Robert McFerrin, Leontyne Price, Jessye Norman, Simon Estes and George Shirley, who were very much pioneers in their respective repertoire. Today, thankfully, artists of color are not at all rare on the concert and/or opera stages of the world. But lest we forget the individual trauma these artists suffered in order to be able to compete in this way, we need to remember the past while we are glorying in the present. Thisbook will, if you let it, open your mind and your ears to wonderful, glorious sounds, without which our world would be a much quieter and poorer place. <br />The author of this book is the renowned Eileen Southern (Professor Emerita of Music and Afro-American Studies at Harvard University) who is herself a musician as well as a writer, and is eminently qualified to illuminate The Music of Black Americans to the world in general. <br />Pages 613 through 646 comprise a rich bibliography and discography; the index takes up 41 pages. NO music lover should be without this invaluable reference work.	2001-01-23

If you've ever thought about participating in a community (that is, non-professional) theatre or other performance group, you should read this book first. Oh, not that every such organization will suffer the loss of one of the star performers the way the Northampton Repertory Company did, and thank goodness for that, or we'd be all out of live performances in no time. But, Karen Sturges has obviously participated; otherwise she could never have gotten the characters and other back-stage business so well-defined as she has in this book.<br />The author also not only knows her music, she is a terrific writer and story-teller, with an awesome ability to plot in a believable manner. <br />Phoebe Mullins has led a life that would devour someone less strong. An only child, she describes herself thusly: &quot;...I, who had lost a mother at eighteen, a father at twenty-two, a baby at twenty-six, a husband at forty-seven...&quot; Had she not immense inner reserves she hadn't known she possessed, Phoebe might well have collapsed into a puddle somewhere. But now, a bit more than a year after becoming a widow, she receives a letter from a long-lost aunt, with an invitation to come visit.<br />A mere handful of days later, Phoebe is not only happily ensconced in the big old Victorian house with her Aunt Portia and Portia's sister-in-law, Anandi, but also finds herself as choreographer and then stage manager for the premiere production of the newly-formed company--the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operetta, The Mikado. <br />Of course, murder rears it's ugly head--not once, but twice, and Phoebe finds herself heading the list of suspects. She also finds herself with not one, but two possible suitors, and for a forty-eight-year-old-widow, this is heady country, indeed. Her wry asides about this and other events will prompt you to giggles and/or guffaws.<br />The music winds its way as sensuously through the book as it does through the operetta, and if the casting is a bit too much to type in some cases, and not enough in others, well, that's a fact of life in community theatre.  Not everyone can be a star. Karen Sturges clearly is, and with eager anticipation, I look forward to her next curtain call.	2001-01-22

Further, knowledge of needle work is not a requirement for enjoying this book. There is enough mention of various techniques to keep the enthusiast interested, while not bombarding the not-so-nimble-fingered over the head with unwanted or un-necessary information.<br />Betsey Devonshire, now in her mid-fifties, has only one sister, Margot Berglund, and like many real-life siblings, each has gone her own way. Both were married and are now widowed, but the multi-married Betsey was used to California's sunny clime, while the more settled Margot thrived in the colder Minneapolis area.  Although she didn't really need to work, Margot had established a needlework shop--Crewel World--to occupy her time, and she is content with her life as small businesswoman and community activist.<br />Betsey feels the need for family, as we all do occasionally, and travels half-way across the US to Minnesota, wondering with every mile if she's made a mistake. But no--there is Margot, warm and welcoming, including a community meeting that very first evening.<br />Like small towns everywhere, there is a vast assortment of characters to be found in Excelsior, and suddenly, one of them turns into a murderer. The police think Margot was the victim of a random thief; Betsey isn't so sure of that, and cannot let Margot's death go un-avenged. Slowly, thread by thread, she unravels the town's secrets (along with those of her sister and her sister's computer) until she reaches the right conclusion.  <br />This is a case of the journey being as interesting as the destination as Betsey discovers resources within herself she'd never even imagined were there, and learns to trust her own feelings and emotions. The other characters in the book are equally charming or devious, as the story requires them to be. There are other books in the series to follow this one, thank goodness, as I found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable addition to the ranks of cozymysteries.	2001-01-22

The question here is:  Is watered-down Agatha Christie as satisfying as the real thing?  My answer is:  Not hardly.  <br />Had this book been a 150-page $4.95 paperback, I might have a different opinion; as a stretched-out 219-page hard-cover selling for $23.95, it's a wonderful lesson in padding. I read it in one sitting--slightly less than two hours--and found myself afterwards wondering why.  <br />I'm not sure that novelizing a play is a really worthwhile adventure. On stage, after all, one doesn't need descriptions of things or people in order to comprehend or understand them. One of Christie's specializations was her depth of characterization, and this is totally lacking here. There is almost no description--of anything, including motivation, which was another of her strengths. <br />There is humor in this tale of a British Country House party, with the appropriate twists and turns to the plot to make it an engaging and different sort of tale. It is definitely a period piece--written in 1954, but clearly harking back to the early 30s in mannerisms, if not in fact. When a murder happens, it nearly turns into a farce, what with the body disappearing on a regular basis. <br />As a light, quick read, it is enjoyable, but I kept thinking that, because of its simplicity, it could almost be more successful if marketed as a young adult or new reader book. On the other hand, if the book brings new readers to Christie's large catalog, nicely listed at the beginning of the book, then it will have succeeded admirably. The three stars I've given the book are in no way to be construed as disrespectful of Dame Agatha or her work, or that of the novel-izer, Charles Osborne, who has previously done the same to two of Christie's other plays. Rather, they are an expression of dissatisfaction with the publisher for the stretching out and over-pricing of this volume.	2001-01-22

A very popular plot-line in romance novels, especially Regency novels, is the marriage of convenience. Forced to adjust and make a life with each other, the characters frequently end up learning as much about themselves as they do about their new partner. <br />The way in which such a marriage is brought into being varies widely, but the nobility of the English male--not just his rank--is usually at the forefront. He offers his name and protection to a young woman who is sorely in need of such a bulwark. <br />Miss Laura Milbanke splurges her entire small inheritance for a dream trip to Venice; she's seen a picture of the famous Hotel Contarini, and has dreamt of little else since then. Knowing she faces a lifetime of boring service, the expense is, to her, well-justified. Her first night there, she makes the reluctant acquaintance of Sir Nicholas Grenville, who clearly would rather she didn't exist at all, whether in Venice or in England. <br />But then, they spend a delightful day together, enjoying the scenery and differentness of Venice, and enraging the Austrian Baron Frederick von Marienfeld. The Baron promptly issues a challenge to Nicholas, one he cannot refuse, with the predictable result. Nicholas is brought back to the hotel, nearing death. <br />Surprising everyone, Nicholas survives--barely, and in order to protect Laura, convinces her to marry him.  Because of their one wonderful day, she grudgingly agrees to marry this man she's come to love, even though he is certain to die. <br />Her persistence as a nurse returns him to a feeble degree of health, and eventually the pair return to England and his estate, King's Cliff. Nicholas had traveled to Venice to consider his position and that of the estate, impoverished by generations of unfeeling, uncaring heirs.  In spite of local opposition, Laura implements the changes Nicholas had discussed with her, endangering herself as well as her husband, still not entirely well, in spite of the care of his old friend and local physician, Daniel Tregarron. Nicholas is discovered to be ill with malaria, but his former fianceé, Augustine Townsend, has no patience with illness; she alternates between Nicholas and his heir, who is also his cousin, James, the earl of  Landford. <br />One could say, 'just another routine romance novel', except that when the author is Sandra Heath, NOTHING is routine. There are twists and turns aplenty before the final, extremely satisfying conclusion.	2001-01-16

Once Napoleon is safely exiled, an American young lady, Lauren Maitland from Boston, is able to travel to London to claim her inheritance.  She really didn't want to do such a thing, especially as her fianc&eacute; was a casualty in the late war between the United States and Britain, but finds her stay in London to be most enjoyable, in the company of her cousin Hester Kingston, and Hester's husband Alex.<br />While riding in the park one day, they encounter Rory Ardmore, Earl of Glenvane in Scotland, a long time friend of Alex. Rory's young sister Mary will soon be celebrating her 18th birthday with a large celebration at their home, Castle Glenvane, and an invitation is promptly issued to the Londoners and their guest--and just as promptly accepted. If nothing else, Alex hopes to learn more about his friend's wife, of whom he has previously heard not even a whisper.<br />Scotland is beautiful, even if some of the inhabitants are not, as Lauren discovers to her dismay. Lady Isabel Maxby has made up her mind to be Rory's second wife, and makes her plans completely clear to the upstart American.<br />As with all the books from this very gifted author, there are layers and layers of plot and characters, each more engrossing than the last. No one does nasty females or supercilious males quite so well. And of course, being British and right there on the scene (so to speak) enables her to create a remarkably picturesque setting in which to unfold the action.

This book is the result of one such very skillful blending process. <br />Once upon a time, there was an 'alternate world' known as 'cafe society'. It was very glamorous--on the outside. The major habitat of the folks who comprised this society was nightclubs; the majority of the world's accumulation of these places were in New York City, between approximately 1920 and 1970. Reasons for this phenomenon were many, although they primarily grew from the Prohibition era, which seemed to have prohibited almost nothing, especially the sale of alcohol and the possibly resultant rise of gangsterism. <br />New York City with its many glittering facets--theatre, dining, drinking, and gambling among them--drew not only the many immigrants, adding their national cultures to the above mix, but also the 'beautiful people' who enjoyed the seemingly unlimited benefits of such a cosmopolitan setting. Thus, at the beginning of the mass-media explosion, radio and movies, plus more and more magazines and newspapers, the art of 'celebrity' was born into this new world. <br />The Stork Club was but one of many of its kind, and this fascinating book touches on all these elements. One entire section details the genealogy of Sherman Billingsley, the larger-than-life owner of the Club, and whose name was synonymous with the era he embraced so whole-heartedly. Anyone who was anyone (and most of them were) was to be found in the lush atmosphere of the Stork Club, where a variety of tastes could easily be accomodated. <br />If you can remember this time at all--a really truly, kinder and gentler one--at least on the surface, you'll enjoy this trip backward in time. If you're too young to remember when celebrities were fêted and treated with respect for who they were, rather than hounded and heckled and attacked for what they are in today's world, you'll appreciate the diligence of the author in unveiling yesterday. <br />On the other hand, if you want to read about the under-belly of society at that time--the Mob 'stars'--Dutch Schultz, Frank Costello and others, you'll find them all here. In many ways, it brings back memories of the Untouchables in Chicago, only in this case, many of New York's untouchables were the elected politicians, law enforcement officials and judges. <br />Granted, it wasn't always nice, but if we're to learn from our mistakes, then this lavishly-illustrated and well-researched book also provides an assortment of lessons. <br />It must have been one of those fortuitous coincidences that brought Sherman Billingsley to New York at just the right time to take advantage of the birth of cafe society and the onset of prohibition. He became one of those 'bigger-than-life' personalities whose outer shell seemed to be made of teflon, even before that substance was invented. <br />There is also a comprehensive bibliography and extensive index.  I enjoyed every page.	2001-01-16

A Regency Christmas Eve features stories from two new-comers, two veterans and one in-between. To begin with, Barbara Metzger's tale of treasure hidden in a little country church and uncovered by the Merry Christmouse (and family) will have you holding your sides, laughing as you read. A rakish viscount is reformed, and made to recognize his true love, while the vicar receives the lady of his choice, as well. The humans may not realize it, but they owe it all to the industrious little Churchmouse dynasty. <br />The weakest story (for me, at least) was The Marriage Stakes by Allison Lane. Dreary and bleak, with a bit of preposterous thrown in, I couldn't like the characters and the setting wasn't much better. In fact, I nearly didn't finish it at all, but other readers may find this style to be enjoyable and should form their own opinion.  <br />Nancy Butler (who won the RITA award for best Regency this year) shows yet another facet of her talent with a story that blends fantasy into romance for one enjoyable result. When Kit Herne goes into the forest looking for the wise-woman who lives there, he wants her to find a cure for his son's ailment. Instead, he finds her daughter, Pippa, who uses her own variety of magic to cure not only the son, but also his father. <br />Diane Farr serves up the lightest and happiest confection with The Reckless Miss Ripley and her hapless target, Fred Bates. A mere three minutes too late for the mail coach, Miss Ripley is forced to find another way to travel to Bath where she expects to meet up with her long-time (possibly imaginary) fiancé. She badgers the not-quite unwilling Mr. Bates into accompanying her, with all the travails, humorous and otherwise, that can befall such ill-prepared travelers. <br />And then, to close the book, Edith Layton tells a wonderful, heart-warming story with a twist. (Be sure to have the tissues handy--you'll need them.) On his way back from the wars to his home in England, Max Evers reads in the newspaper that his financial agent has been the victim of an embezzler and all is lost! When he sees his townhouse surrounded by clamoring bailiffs, that sad fact is made all too clear to him, so he turns away from all he'd been anticipating this Christmas season, taking great pains not to be found by anyone from his past life. Especially he turns from his fiancée who's been waiting patiently for him for five long years. However, all is made delightfully right again, however, on the most wondrous night of the year--Christmas Eve!	2001-01-05

Mark my words, however, you'll be hearing a lot about Shannon Donnelly during the next years; she is an author to be reckoned with, believe me! <br />The depth of the characterization in this book is extraordinary. A sentence, sometimes merely one word, conveys more here than entire pages have in other books. Another plus (at least to this reviewer) is the ages of those characters: Maeve Midden is eight-and-twenty, rather old for a heroine, while the hero, Colonel Andrew Derhurst, now Lord Rothe, is ten years her senior. <br />One of the problems with the primogeniture system is, if something happens to the primo, the secondary is seldom sufficiently experienced, much less trained to step up and into primo's empty boots. Such is the case with the Colonel, a second son who was sent off to the military at the age of eighteen, courtesy of his father who obligingly purchased his colors for him. The fact that perhaps the lad might not have wanted colors had no influence on the father; the older son would be the next Lord Rothe, and there was an end to it. <br />When that older son dies, the by-then Colonel is sent home to take over the estates and the title--plus the widow and teen-aged daughter of his brother. They seem like empty-headed flibber-tee-gibbets to the battled-hardened Andrew, who has no patience with them, nor the drawing room skills needed to build a relationship with the only family he now has left to him. <br />Maeve, on the other hand, was born a gentlewoman, but left motherless at the age of four. Hard-headed and stubborn, she willingly cooperated in her own ruination at the hands of an experienced rake. When her father disowned her, she turned to the only person who had ever been kind to her--her teacher, Miss Midden. Soon, however, Maeve is out on her own again, and becomes a governess. <br />Thus, these two lost souls are brought together in a highly believable manner, and in spite of themselves, are drawn one to the other. Of course, the teen-aged Clarissa protests the title of governess assigned to Maeve, who suggests instead that of companion. And it is thus that this relationship is forged. Clarissa is a rare handful, indeed, and unknowingly brings the two older persons together, in a startling twist to the 'unsuitable elopement' gambit. <br />This is an outstanding traditional Regency romance; you'll find something marvelous on every page. I just wish the author had chosen a better surname for Maeve to assume. But if that's the only gripe I can find in this most satisfying book--well, then, the author must indeed know best.  I'm eagerly awaiting the next book from the very talented Ms. Donnelly, and I'll bet you'll feel the same way, too.	2001-01-02

She had no business attending a Masquerade Ball. But then, before the sudden death of her father one year earlier, she would have received her own invitation to the Ball. So, when Adele Russell was busily delivering merchandise from her friend's haberdashers to the society ladies of Bath, and saw one of the treasured invitations on the street in front of her, she decided to take advantage of this bonus, and attend one--possibly last, at least for her--such function. <br />Of course, one of the first persons she encountered was her former fiancé, David Latimer, the Earl of Blaisdon. Even though he persisted in sharing a dance with her, and did not penetrate her disguise, still he took the time to warn her away from the dashing young man who had made sure to also have a dance with her--the intriguing, and unknown Sir Mask. <br />Five years ago, a sudden trip to India required David to leave Adele, with only a letter to advise her of his journey. The letter went astray, and the betrothal was broken. Now, the earl is the matrimonial target of Euphemia, the Marchioness of Heydon, who is daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Bellingham. It just so happens that at about the time David went off to India, the Duke's fortunes took a marvelous turn for the better, and his son, Rex, Lord Talbourne, will now have something more than an empty inheritance to anticipate. <br />These are the major players in this skillfully-woven tapestry of life in Regency England, particularly in Bath, which is so well-drawn, the reader is taken on a virtual tour of that ancient Roman city. The Pulteney Bridge, the Circus, the Royal Crescent, the Assembly Rooms, all play their parts as well as do the many multi-faceted characters. <br />You'll love Euphemia, who is one of those slightly over-the-top personalities who will make you laugh in spite of yourself as she labors mightily to capture David, all the while running Adele all over Bath on errands for the haberdashery. There is even the 'perfect' villain, Sir Frederick Repton, in the service of the Duke, who now has aspirations of a political career in his own right. <br />Sir Mask is eventually un-masked, the villain banished, and like all good theatre, all's well that end's well. It's the journey from opening curtain until final standing ovation that provides such satisfaction; in this instance, from the masterful pen of veteran Regency author Sandra Heath. First published in 1983, it's easy to see why it's been reprinted several times, and you'll think it well worth your effort to find your own copy.	2000-12-22

Sometimes a first book is so truly marvelous, succeeding in every way possible, the reader wants to jump up and down for joy! Such was my feeling after reading this marvelous book. There is music in it, on nearly every page, but yet it isn't really about music. Rather it is the world of collectibles: usually antique, they're mostly musical, mechanical, automatons, etc.  <br />Dr. Thomas Purdue, a neurosurgeon in Manhattan, not only collects such things, he appreciates their existence, even if in the collection of someone not necessarily his friend. The day after a party at the home of a wealthy fellow-collector, Purdue is awakened by a phone call advising him that the fellow-collector was murdered shortly after the party's break-up. Soon thereafter, he receives another phone call, alerting him to the existence of a music box for which he has been longing. The box is at an antique shop in Manhattan, and it doesn't take long to for him to realize that it was the property of the dead millionaire.<br />Thus begins this lively, fast-paced, wonderfully well-written story, peopled with an unusual cast of primary and secondary characters, and that travels easily from the various boroughs of New York City to London and back again. <br />The author has deservedly won an award from the Musical Box Society for other writings about the field of mechanical music. His knowledge of these unique and esoteric creations is apparent on every page, as is his knowledge of Manhattan (especially) and people in general.  Many of the characters in this book are reminiscent of those in the pages of works by Damon Runyon. For an unusual visit to a world many of us will never experience, this book is most satisfactory.  I loved it, and am impatient for the next one.	2000-12-17

Lately, they've taken to re-issuing books under the Harlequin label that were originally published in England by Mills &amp; Boon. As a devoted reader of Regency novels, I for one, am delighted. If they're all as well-done as this book, there is only one word that will suffice--hoorah!<br />Phoebe Smith is a governess, although not quite in the usual mold.  Her three teen-aged charges have managed to drive away all the previous caretakers, and when their guardian, the Baron Sebastian Deverell, returns from India where he's made a fortune or two for himself, she decides to appeal to his better nature for guidance.<br />Of course, he doesn't think he has one, but he certainly does appreciate Miss Smith, although not quite in the way she wishes he would. <br />This book is quite Heyer-like in its humor and adventurous episodes. There is more sexual tension than Heyer usually employed, but it's not heavy-handed, more of the bewildered variety, as Sebastian and Phoebe struggle with emotions neither was quite aware of before their initial meeting. <br />The Deverell siblings--Gerald, Theodosia and Cressida (the latter two are twins) are lively and prone to excapades in the company of each other or various friends and relatives. The secondary cast of characters are well-drawn, with their own sub-plots, one of the many advantages of a longer book, which does, of course, make for a more substantial reading experience. I look forward with great anticipation to more books--from Julia Byrne, and Harleqin Regency.	2000-12-17

Diane Farr goes from strength to strength, and does it with such seeming effortlessness that it's truly mind-boggling. But, how wonderful for her many fans! Of course, I am one of that number, and have been for many years. <br />If you read her first book THE NOBODY you'll quickly recall the steely Duchess of Arnsford and her equally steely daughter, Elizabeth. You'll find them again in this new book, having moved to center stage in the process. The Delacourts are a wide-spread family, and when notified that one far-flung waif is the only remaining member of one discarded branch, the Duchess appropriates Celia Delacourt for reasons of her own.<br />Unknown to anyone but Hubbard, who has served Her Grace quietly and loyally for many years, the Duchess is terminally ill, and is desperate to settle her family's future before such actions are no longer possible. The future of the ducal palace, Delacourt, is nearly as important as the marriage of Elizabeth, and the heir, Jack. The Duchess is determined that it will be her iron will that will prevail.<br />Celia, of course, doesn't know this until well into the story, and proceeds to unknowingly upset the well-laid plans of the Duchess, thus providing a wonderful reading experience for us. Initially, it appears the future as envisioned by the Duchess will not materialize, and so, of course, she sets off in another direction, only to be baulked once again, when, once it's too late, everything works as she'd originally dreamed they would.  This charming story has everything--love, laughter, tears, warmth, poignancy, and an abundance of Christmas cheer. Oh--and one mustn't forget the most amazing character of all! Manegold should certainly appear again--somewhere. He just simply can't be a one-book cat!	2000-12-17

Indeed, the author is not the only person to refer to this as the 'Olympics for the Violin'. Such competitions are a fact of life for aspiring young musicians, and the pressures are unbelievable, as a career can easily be made or broken by the final standings. The descriptions of the competition are exactly right--as are those of the young entrants.<br />Joan Spencer is an amateur violist who loves and lives her music. But that is not her entire life. Widowed, perhaps too young, she was left with two young children and the necessity to earn a living. Now her children are more-or-less out on their own, and Joan can resume her own life. And so she does.<br />A big part of her new life is Lieutenant Fred Lundquist of the Oliver police force. As much as she loves him, she wonders if she can cope with being the wife of a policeman. As the story of the vanishing violinist unfolds, intruding even to the little town of Oliver, Joan comes to realize that time is more important than anything else, and she mustn't waste whatever time she and Fred can have together.<br />This well-written book will appeal greatly to lovers of classical music, whether knowledgeable about it or not (and kudos to the editor who didn't dumb down the many musical references!) as well as to mystery novel fans. Women of a certain age will also like this book, along with the clear-headed Joan who hasn't lost her common sense. She is such a genuinely nice person I'd really like to have her for a friend.

In addition, the town will mourn those of its young men who went off to war and will not return.<br />Eight women in the community, including young Kate Fallon, who has become an ace welder due to the shortage of young men left at home as part of the work force, have formed the Molly Pitcher Society, named after the Revolutionary War heroine. The mission of this new group is to aid the war effort in whatever way seems best. The first project is a servicemen's club, or canteen.  <br />Almost before anything can be accomplished, however, all eight women receive 'poison pen' letters, sent anonymously, of course.  A suicide and two murders follow rapidly, disturbing the peace of the small town.  A wrong arrest is questioned by Kate, who shrewdly analyzes the various parts of the puzzle before enacting her own Agatha Christie-type showdown.  <br />As in the first book, the research lends an aura of authenticity and nostalgia, and is seamlessly blended into the narrative.  Only one problem looms--Robinsville is such a small town--if multiple murders are to keep Kate busy, the town will soon be decimated! Maybe she'll need to move to Philly to keep her skills intact until her soldier boy comes home again!	2000-12-08

During the reading period, I daresay you'll often catch yourself with a wide smile on your face, or even enjoying an out-loud giggle.<br />Kate Huntington has the knack for creating extended families, awash with children and pets, and other engaging, and some not-so engaging, characters. What more natural pairing then, for a Christmas romp, than the bachelor country squire, Robert Langtry, who has inherited his brother's four orphaned children, and the Lady Madelyn Rathbone, lovely, wealthy young aristocrat. <br />For you see, Madelyn and Robert have a history. They've proposed to each other numerous times, but for various reasons, no marriage between them ever occurred. Madelyn has never been around children at all, being an only child who was orphaned at a young age, and thereafter was always in the company of much older guardians. Oh, they had her best interests at heart, but hearts and best interests are not known to be chummy with each other. And, it is imperative--at least in the eyes of those guardians--that she marry as befits her wealth and her station in life. Non-wealthy country squires need not apply. <br />Robert, on the other hand, loves his wards, and is determined to lavish care on and for them, in an attempt to somehow make up for the loss of their parents. It would appear that his path will sharply diverge from that of Madelyn. Until, that is, a country house party at the home of Alexander and Vanessa Blakely. In spite of all efforts to the contrary by a wide assortment of house-guests, and with the aid of the four spirited children, Madelyn and Robert will find the way to make their paths converge, and lead to the altar. Finally. And now, Madame Author--for nextyear's gift to your readers, may we please have the story of Count Andreas Briccetti?

There are the heroine's first-person voice throughout; repeated strong hints of something nasty in the background and the reappearance of the truly nasty villain; an abundance of secrets that are not at all the usual trivial gossip-fodder; a likeable ingenue, along with a host of other wonderfully-realized secondary characters, and last but not least, a marvelous, dashing hero.<br />With no help from her family, Cornelia survived her childhood trauma and is now the widowed Countess of Wyckend. She has been asked to convey her thirteen-year-old niece, Lili, from the convent in France, where she has been raised, back to England.  In the company of Cornelia's cousin, Alastair, they journey to Vienna, to enjoy, and participate in, the celebrations attendant on the Congress of Vienna.<br />During this social whirl, Cornelia becomes aware of her love for Alastair, and his for her, but she is convinced that nothing can come of it. Happily, she is proven wrong by the end of the book.<br />The villain is duly dispatched, but not before some truly gruesome conversations regarding this eventual happening. If  'all's well that ends well' then perhaps all that goes before may be worth the happy ending. But not without a struggle on the part of the reader, as layer after layer of the dark underbelly of society is laid bare. Not your usual romance story this, but one that is certainly well-written, and peopled with unforgettable characters, to be sure.	2000-12-05

Unless you are a 'string figure' devotee, you may find this book to be very 'high maintenance'. To be sure, I had no idea there was such a thing as 'string figures' even though as a child, I certainly was entertained by my grandfather's attempts at making a 'cat's cradle'. Poor grandpa! He was a much better plumber. <br />This book, however, did not prove to be so entertaining, at least not to this reader. In fact, I skipped over most of the last two-thirds of the story, and will have serious doubts about reading any more in this series.(I still do like the author's other series, though.) Several chapters begin with instructions for various of the string figures that are mentioned throughout.  If you like to read knitting or crochet patterns, they may appeal to you; otherwise, they might as well be written in a foreign language, which I suppose they are, really. <br />Many of the same characters appear in this book as in its predecessor: the mystery novel readers of Murder by the Yard, including the cute, petite, red-haired paleo-anthropologist who now works as a reference librarian, Dr. Megan Clark, and her unknown-to-her swain, history professor, Dr. Ryan Stevens. In addition to her apparent fascination with Ph.Ds (nearly every character in the book has one) the author has also kept her annoying habit of alternating voices in alternating chapters. Omniscient alternates with the repetitious, first-person maunderings of Ryan, who is certainly one of the klutzier (and truly stupid-appearing) persons to be found in books these days. Poor guy. I do wish he wouldn't feel the ever-present urge to continually remind us that Megan is indeed, a cute, petite, red-haired paleo-anthropologist. <br />In spite of the interference of police lieutenant Jerry Carr, Megan eventually solves the mystery of the two murders, as well as the other mystery, which is better left unidentified, so as not to spoil it for other readers.	2000-12-05

There are at least two types of readers of historical romance novels: those who read primarily for the romance, and those who really want the history. Seldom are each of them satisfied by a single novel. This well-written, poorly-proofed novel succeeds better at the romance than the history.<br />Why is it, I wonder, that an author will choose to set a novel during a particular time in history because of one or more historical events that lend verisimilitude to the story, and then neglect the research on the under-pinnings of that same era? Especially if those under-pinnings constitute the secondary plot?<br />The British Regency era is noted for drawing authors like bees to flowers; it was a vibrant period awash with bigger-than-life characters, set against the Napoleonic wars. Facts connected to the military are usually correct--it's hard, after all, to argue with all those history books. But then, something as simple as the presence of the conductor of an orchestra rapping his baton on his desk appears. For the music-lover or student, this (and the other musical anachronisms) is enough of a jolt to pull the reader right out of the story, and the rest of the novel may well fade into oblivion.<br />This is only one of many novels to suffer from a similar fault, and almost all of them are set in this same period. However, if you read for the romance, you'll probably enjoy the St. John twins, Dorian and Davis, as they wend their way through the social and musical worlds of Regency England while trying to solve a musical mystery. Nicholas Derrington, Earl of Seacombe, had been a Naval captain before a charge of treason relieved him of his duty, and tainted his family heritage. He needs a scrap of music that supposedly carries an encrypted inscription on the reverse side, to help clear his name. Trouble is, Dorian wants that same fragment, part of a love song written to her elderly aunt by a former lover who was a composer.<br />Davis St. John has his own romantic troubles; having to decide between the beautiful Elizabeth, daughter of a Duke, or the lovely, earthy, and widowed Susanna. London's glittering society, musicales, Almack's, country house parties, all are present and accounted for in this sweeping novel.<br />Romance = 4 stars. History = 3 stars. Music = 2 stars. The average is why I could honestly only give this book 3 stars. A person who reads more for the romance aspect might well think it should have more. Seems fair to me.troubles; having to decide between the beautiful Elizabeth, daughter of a Duke, or the lovely, earthy, and widowed Susanna.

Anthologies are very popular these days, providing delightly appetizers that amuse and enlighten and tease while introducing readers to new and wonderful authors. An anthology may be considered successful if there are just one or even two terrific stories contained in its pages. This particular one succeeds admirably, as nearly all seventeen of them are wonderful. Two in particular stand out, however. Suppose you were asked who, of all the currently published mystery writers with whom you might be familiar, would be best suited to write a short mystery in the voice of a Tazmanian Devil? If you said Barbara Paul, you'd be absolutely correct. GO TO THE DEVIL is truly hilarious, and well worth the cost of the entire book, even if you didn't read any of the others.  <br />But if you did that, you'd miss out on FINAL VOWS by Elizabeth Ann Scarborough, in which more cats than not do have nine lives, and even if you don't particularly like cats, you'll still enjoy this whimsical bit of fantasy, in which all the neighborhood's cats (living and otherwise) catch the culprit.  <br />Other stories (by such mystery luminaries as Anne Perry, Dorothy Cannell, and Nancy Pickard) feature other cats or kittens, a couple of dogs, a hamster, and an owl. It's a very pleasant and enjoyable read, not least of which are the terse introductory comments from the title character himself--Midnight Louie!	2000-11-23

If not, I highly recommend you do so straightaway. You won't regret it. Dido is a modern young woman, newly divorced, daughter of a former academic at Oxford (who seems to have had other assorted former careers, as well) who now owns an antiquarian bookshop in London's Islington area.  <br />Coming home late at night after having purchased a privately-owned library some eighty miles from her home, she is menaced by a white car. Eventually, however, the other driver loses interest, and Dido arrives home, nerve-wracked but otherwise unharmed. <br />The next day, her father, Barnabas, recovering from serious heart surgery, receives an anonymous letter, and from then on, the pace never lets up. We meet several of London's other antiquarian book dealers, plus Dido's former husband Davey. Briefly, that is, for in just a few days time, Davey and the white car fall victim to a bomb.  <br />The police officer assigned to the bombing, Paul Grant, bids fair to becoming an important part of Dido's life, if only she can figure out why Davey had to die. What does she have that she doesn't realize she has? Neither Davey's new friend, Ilona, nor his mother, Sally, are much help either.  <br />One clue is a book about a possible forger. Or has the forger been forged? This is a wonderfully well-written book that works on several levels. I cannot recommend it highly enough to those who enjoy truly intelligent books. How can you not love a book that includes this line &quot;She continued to watch her drink as closely as though she were waiting for it to change colour and play the National Anthem.&quot;  You won't regret the acquaintance, I promise.	2000-11-23

Sometimes, when a mystery or other novel contains an animal(s) as co-sleuth or even as companion, the author gets so carried away with how wonderful and splendid and grand the animal is, he or she tends to go overboard into the cutesy area. I admit that on occasion, I have not finished reading such books, because even though I generally do like animals, I prefer them to stay as an animal, and not assume human characteristics. Of course, should one such ever 'talk' to me (and make sense) I might change my mind.<br />This book however, carefully walks that tight-rope and never goes too far astray from what is a really cracker-jack plot. Recent history can be as fascinating as the farther away variety, as this book readily illustrates. Eugenics, whether applied to humans or animals, can be a fascinating topic of discussion; whether it should be practiced or not is another matter entirely.<br />Holly Winter, a writer and sometime dog-trainer, loves Alaskan Malamute Dogs. Of that there can be no question. When she lands an assignment to write the text for a photo book of a famous dog-lover, she has no idea where the tale will lead her. All the clues are nicely laid out, and the sprinkling of facts in with the fiction combine to educate as well as entertain the discerning reader. For instance, I have no idea if Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge ever really did exist, but I know that Isabella Stewart Gardner did--and left her home and immense fortune to founding the museum she named Fernway Court, and which was subsequently spectacularly robbed in 1990. <br />If this is a new trend--combining recent history with current day people and happenings--albeit in a rather historic setting (in this case Cambridge Massachusetts) then I'm all for it.  I found this to be engaging and informative novel, and recommend it to readers of mystery novels--whether animal lovers or no.	2000-11-23

If ever you meet a too-top-lofty Duke, you'll be absolutely delighted at having first read this book.  (Pun intended. You'll have to read the book to figure it out.)  This is the third in the four-book series about Lord Nightingale's escapades, and is just pure and simple fun!  <br />The Duke of Sotherland had twin sons; Edward and Peter. However, the Duchess was incapable of living with the duke in happy matrimony or any other kind, for that matter, and so, unhappily, when the boys were seven years old, he allowed her to live elsewhere with Peter, the younger son. The boys never forgot each other, but had no way of knowing where the other was.  <br />When Edward met Eugenia (in Lord Nightingale's Love Song) it was at a country home he had leased for a short stay out of the city. To his surprise, his face was familiar to several of the local folks, among them the rector and his family of five daughters. The oldest of these, Mary, considered herself secretly engaged to Peter, who had been in the area for some time, hiring himself out to do occasional labor, before being accused of theft, and as suddenly leaving the area for parts unknown. <br />It helps immensely for you to have already read books one and two in this four-book series that culminates in next month's Lord Nightingale's Christmas. It's virtually impossible to adequately summarize the plot of this perfectly delightful and charming book without exceeding the word count, so let me just advise you to get all four books, and settle in for a wonderful long weekend's worth of reading about love and happiness and joy. What more could one want?	2000-11-23

In September, 1984, when this book was first published, the selling price was $2.50 US.  The author, Sandra Heath, had already seen at least seven Regency novels published by Signet prior to this book. In her native England, there had been six or seven traditional historical novels published as well. Sixteen years later, I believe her to be the only author who has consistently published top-notch, traditional Regency novels, three or four of them a year, and all for the same publisher, during the intervening years. <br />The only surprising thing about that prior statement is that no other publisher has grabbed her away, for there can be few authors writing today with such an astonishing command of her craft. Her research is impeccable: if a person or place or event is mentioned, you may be sure it might have happened in real life exactly as she has written it. Her characters are true to their time and place, and anachronisms do NOT fly from their mouths with reckless abandon. <br />Perhaps the secret is in the details. Living in England certainly helps, but it also takes a vast array of books, contemporary to the time being written about, to provide the minutiae of every day life with which her books are imbued. One is never left unsatisfied at the conclusion of a book by Sandra Heath. Styles have changed in publishing over the years, and she has changed with the times; yet she's never lowered her exceedingly high standards. <br />A Commercial Enterprise centers around a celebratory banquet honoring the Duke of Wellington, in the spring of 1818. There are other sub-plots, as well, in addition to the main romance. It's a lovely, long, satisfying book, 286 pages, to be exact, with little more than a kiss or two between the hero and heroine, and yet, I found it very hard to put down. Sandra Heath--I salute you, as a true exponent of the Regency Romance. I hope you produce another 50 books for us to read and savor.	2000-10-27

For some odd reason, I found myself reading the reviews for this book, before actually starting to read it. They certainly didn't put me off it, by any means, but I confess to wondering when I would be cast adrift by whatever was going to happen--or not happen--in the latter part of the book. To my total surprise, and in my own opinion (of course) none of the things some reviewers complained about, presented themselves to me. What did happen, though, was that while I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as I do almost everything from this author, I began to wonder if perhaps over-analysis masquerading as a book review is always a good thing. This is FICTION, after all. Certainly it has a historical setting, and the one thing for which Ms. Balogh may always be counted upon is her absolute command of that historical setting; including place, speech, clothing and behavior. Her characters could only, ever, live in the world she has created for them. Thank goodness, she never puts 20th century folks into her mostly 18th or early 19th century stories.  <br />One difference from some of her previous books did become obvious rather quickly. There is indeed more conversation than introspection, which I quite like, although I know some readers don't. Also, many of the author's other recent books have made me very weepy, in either of the two directions available to the reader--great happiness or great sadness. I didn't find that in this book, which is certainly not a detraction, merely a statement of fact. However, I also suspect I laughed out loud more than usual, which I certainly did enjoy. This is a very witty book!<br />It's difficult to compare apples and oranges; no author worth his or her salt should ever write the same book over and over. But I do believe this is quite possibly Mary Balogh's best book yet.	2000-10-26

It sneaks in under your guard, and before you know it, you're hooked! Dido Hoare is the main protagonist, a 30something single mom who juggles the various facets of her life with varying degrees of success. Her young son Ben is teething, her elderly father cannot resist being her father, and her antiquarian bookshop in London appears to be doing rather well, actually. And, there's even a new man in her life--well, sort of. Problem is, he's married, but rather conveniently, he's also with the CID. Everything is relatively peaceful, until-- <br />Tom Ashe had been a fairly frequent visitor to the store, occasionally making small purchases, as though to justify his presence there. But his sudden death proves disturbing, in more ways than one, for Dido is named executor of his estate. Estate? Well, yes, there is one. And an endearing, elderly widow, plus a pseudo son. All inquiries into Tom's life end up being balked by a secret service edict. Just who was Tom Ashe, anyway? And how did he acquire a considerable estate? <br />Dido is an intelligent, curious woman with an obvious love for books, and that's just how she acts. She's not superwoman by any means, but that curiosity does get her into trouble. All the clues are nicely laid out, just waiting to be picked up. This is a very civil type of book, one which could almost just as easily have been written fifty years ago, with its ambiance of small-town London. I loved it.	2000-10-25

She then adds, &quot;A victim of gross taxidermal incompetence.&quot;<br />Have you ever read a book that appeared to have been written by a committee? One without too many planning meetings? Actually, I see this as being more of a group writers session. &quot;Let's see how many outlandish things we can think of to put into one book, then we'll draw a name out of the hat to see who gets to actually write it!&quot;<br />You know how 'they' always say: Don't write in first person?  or Don't bother with Gothics - they're dead.  or Don't set your story in Germany, it's not romantic.  or Don't use more than one point-of-view style?  or Don't mix types of books; pick one--ghosts or whatever, and be done with it.<br />How about a 500 year-old curse that's lasted for 20 generations that causes the mother of the heir to die in childbirth almost immediately afterward? How about our 1990s thirty-something heroine who convinces the ghosts--all twenty of the former countesses, still in residence at the ßchloss--to help her break the curse? You wouldn't believe all the things they do, in addition to watching soap-operas on television. Once they've convinced someone to turn the set on for them, that is. Apparently, it's a bit difficult to manage when you're just an ectoplasm. They seem have no troubles with mobile phones, however.<br />Well--this mish-mosh of a book does and has all these things. I admit its a more-or-less well-written mish-mosh, but still! And this is the third time around for it! Why? Furthermore, since it's been updated (mentioning the Euro, for instance) since the first time out in 1991, why didn't they at least take out (or fix) themany, many typos in the process?<br />My advice is read, just don't be mislead by it. It is a mass-market paperback that clearly says 'FICTION' on the spine. It is a sort of love story, but in no way is it a romance. If you read it expecting that, you'll be seriously disappointed. It's almost more of a fantasy than anything. If you can read it with no advance expectations, however, and roll with the many sudden changes, it can be a somewhat enjoyable diversion. If there's nothing else available.	2000-10-25

This may produce almost the exact opposite effect from that intended by the author. Such is the case with this book. Had only half the references to Serena's fears and insecurities been included, they would have conveyed her ideas satisfactorily and not left the reader with that 'beat-over-the-head' feeling. Granted, growing up as she did, her sense of inadequacy and mis-treatment are not to be wondered at, and the author is to be complimented for tackling the problem of women's rights. But, enough already! Enough.<br />And that hero! Yes, we all say we want warm and fuzzy, but not somewhat stupid with it. How else to account for his actions? On the other hand, it was nice to find characters from previous books mentioned or taking a larger supporting role in this story, and to find the promise that they'll appear again. Another clever note was to have the book contain three weddings: one near the beginning and one near the end, featuring the same couple both times; the latter occasion being the one in which they really meant the words. The wedding in the middle was that of an unusual pair of secondary characters, righting a slew of wrongs, and bringing joy to nearly everyone, including the reader.<br />A bit more attention to the editing would have enhanced the book greatly: missing words and characters referred to by the wrong name add nothing but aggravation. I suspect that most readers will follow the series, however, wanting to see the loose ends tied up -- even if on the installment plan.	2000-10-25

After the premature death of her father, Jane is compelled to be the 'man of the house,' carefully tending the small inheritance, to care for her now-invalidish mother and younger sister. To supplement this small amount of money, she finds work as the secretary/companion/financial adviser to Lady Kettering, at the local castle.<br />Lady Kettering has one son, whose own inheritance was left him in a sort of 'spendthrift' trust--Luke may not have the entirety until his thirty-fifth birthday, unless he first demonstrates to his mother than he can properly appreciate his financial situation.  As a typical member of the ton, of course, he is subject to frequent wagers, especially against Lord Moncton, who has been observed to cheat. And then there's Luke's ladybird, and the upkeep on his horses and townhouse . . .<br />When Lady Kettering decides that just what Luke needs is a new 'man-of-business', and that this new 'man' will be none other than Jane, she has no idea what she has wrought! Suffice it to say that 'all's well that ends well' with happy endings all around, at least for the good guys.<br />Some of the behavior of Jane or other characters may seem a bit outr&eacute; to readers who are devoted to the Regency genre, but then, there have always been those persons who specialized in non-conformity. As much of a stickler as I am, I didn't find this to be all *that* outlandish. It's another good solid example of the craft of Elizabeth Mansfield, except that it's new--rather than a reissue.

According to the useful 3 pages of Glossary at the back end of this book,  'ahoo' or--in utter disarray--is very nearly an appropriate description of the book. It's an entertaining near mish-mosh that couldn't really quite make up its mind as to what it wanted to be when it grew up. It's part adventure, part mystery, part history, very much nautical, and even has a tad of romance to it. The cover calls it A Maritime Mystery. What it did turn out to be, however, is--a very enjoyable read. <br />When Bartholomew Hoare (and don't make cracks about that--it's a fine old British surname) loses his voice, due to a spent musket ball striking him in the larynx, he is pushed out of the Navy--his only true love.  After all, a Captain who can't be heard shouting above any storm or battle, isn't of much use to HM's Navy, regardless of his seaworthiness in all other matters. <br />Having exhibited some skill at solving puzzles, Hoare is assigned to shore duty at Portsmouth, to find out why ships of the line have been exploding, causing not only loss of ship, but horrendous loss of lives, as well. Patiently gathering up bits and pieces of information, and meeting various personages of the time, Jane Austen among them, Hoare spends all too much time on land, especially on those blasted four-legged creatures he's always despised--horses! <br />There are several stories here, almost as though the author had first written a batch of shorter stories, then wove them together to make one book-length volume. Nevertheless, it is enjoyable, and prompts one to search out the next book in the series, if only to find out what happens to Hoare and his little gray partridge...	2000-10-20

Because this is, quite simply, classic Lansdowne, one with smiles and giggles and love and laughter on very nearly every page, along with a classic assortment of  animals and people you won't soon forget. <br />There's a lot of plot to go along with all these characters, but after all, this is just book two of a four book series, so there rather needs to be a lot of plot and a lot of characters. And a lot of love and laughter to accompany them on their adventure. <br />Eugenia Chastain is the second of the three cousins to be featured; the absent, but frequently mentioned Nicky was the first.  One can but hope that Neil will be the next. Or if not next, then the next one after that, because one gets the sneaky suspicion that Peter, the long-lost brother of  the Marquess of Bradford, will be the hero of book three.  Seems only fair, as the Marquess has found his true love in the petite form of Eugenia.  <br />Of course, Delight and Stanley Blithe and Sweetpea and Lord Nightingale--and let us not forget Nod--helped these two who'd thought they'd never find a love of their own, so we can but hope they'll help Peter and Mary, and then Neil and Alice, too.

When I read this author's first book, DEAD CAT BOUNCE, not only was I blown away by the lyricism of the writing--simply gorgeous--but also by the marvelous way the author blended so many disparate items together into one extremely satisfying book.  It can't be easy to mix together--much less make sense of--a small town on the very east coast of Maine; a mathematical genius who's a female (Jacobia Tiptree--wonderful name!) for goodness' sake, newly divorced; a teen-aged son who, while not rebellious as most teens are, has his own problems to fight--dyslexia, among others; a former husband with whom Jake somehow manages to be on fairly good terms, even though he is a first-class jerk; a new man in her life, who sounds positively dishy; and--an 1823 house, complete with ghost, and in need of renovations. Somehow the author makes it all work splendidly.<br />I was somewhat hesitant, therefore, to open TRIPLE WITCH, because the first book had been so wonderful. First books frequently are especially wonderful, just because they're first books. They can gestate for years, if necessary, whereas second books usually have to make their appearance after just a few months. But, Jake and all the above-mentioned components are still all present, including the former husband who's now decided he'll move to Eastport, too.  <br />Triple Witch features an eclectic list of ingredients: a former financial high-flyer who's been barred from the industry, but with an entire room in HIS newly-renovated old house devoted to the very latest computer equipment connected to international financial sources, and with a pasture housing a flock of llamas; a young man, murdered, who's father was also murdered a day later, but leaving behind a barn full of dog-food bags, now containing US money--to the tune of some two million dollars!; an encroaching possible crime-wave in the usually sleepy little village, which has the residents acting as vigilantes, out prowling through the night-darkened streets, but armed only with  flashlights.<br />Ellie White and Jacobia Tiptree are one fabulous and formidable pair of females. Together, along with some help from Jake's friend Wade and her son, Sam, plus Ellie's husband George, and the town's low-key chief of police, Bob Arnold, and even a smidgen of assistance from the former husband, Victor, the bad guys are routed, resulting in a mostly happy ending. <br />Sarah Graves is indeed marvelous--I'll never hesitate to read another of her books, and neither should you. <br />(I do have just one teensy-tiny complaint, however. When I was a kid, buckwheat pancakes were fairly easy to come by, and always ranked high on my list of favorite foods. Not so any more, though. Oh, one can find the special flour needed, by why oh, why? wasn't Ellie's recipe included? Bummer. Truly an excellent book otherwise, though!)	2000-10-20

Since she was just out of the cradle, almost, Gregory Ward has had a disastrous effect on Eloise Kendall.  Anything that could go wrong, would go wrong whenever the two would meet.  So of course, when Eloise and her younger brother Jeremy are orphaned by the deaths of their parents, the siblings end up living with her youngish widowed cousin, the Dowager Lady Theadosia Deighton.<br />The only difficulty with this situation is that Gregory's uncle, Lord Threwsbury has the adjoining property.  And Jeremy's best friend and constant companion is the earl's nephew and heir, Basil. <br />Gregory has been busily carving out a career for himself as a politician, and returns to his uncle's home with the Whig party whip, Colin Jamison. The two hope to raise funds for Gregory's next campaign.   <br />Unexpectedly, however, love at first sight strikes both Colin and Thea, casting each into alternate bouts of exhilaration and despair. While trying to sort out these strange feelings, which neither have ever experienced prior to this experience, Gregory and Eloise are having their own battle of the sexes. They don't want to care for each other, but yet those amazing emotions keep erupting!  <br />In other parts of the realm, the Luddites are beginning to make their feelings known, as well, but Gregory thinks the returning soldiers--now no longer needed--have a real complaint. And then a villain steps in, and kidnaps the wrong heir.  <br />This is a delightful book--in particular the romance of the older couple, which unfortunately gets short shrift in the hurried-up ending.  Too bad the publisher couldn't have granted another page or two for a slightly more detailed resolution! Still, all the loose ends are tied up in a most satisfactory manner, if a bit rushed. The cover is charming,too, with its Hugh Grant lookalike!	2000-10-17

I'll be the first person to say that not every reader will adore every book written. I'm at the top of the list  when it comes to avoidance of horror, or overly profane or violent books, or even exceedingly sensual ones, for that matter. And frankly, I'm a bit tired of the (at least to me) over-emphasis on physical beauty. Every lord cannot be the handsomest creature that ever walked, nor can the heroine of every book be absolutely the most gorgeous! Give Ms.Lansdowne credit for creating HUMAN characters, with whom we should all be able to identify. At least, I should clarify this--the human characters are human. The animals are delightful in their own way, as they should be. Children, too, are children; some are advanced for their age, some are not. Most all, however, are winsome at some point. It's the talent of this author to catch each child at whatever age the winsomeness is the most charming.<br />I LOVE the books of Judith Lansdowne, however. All of them. Long or short. Because I always know what I'll find when I settle down to read. Every page brims with love and laughter, adventure and absurdity, mixed with great amounts of probability. Her characters are REAL. If you think hard enough, quite probably you'll know someone very like many of them.  <br />Absurd? Yes. Busy? Of course. More than just two characters in the book? Thank goodness, yes again! If you only want very sensual stories, in which the romance between the two major personages is the plot in its entirety--and you want to follow along into the bedroom with them, commentary provided--then you will probably not be very satisfied with her stories. This series  especially, as it will, admittedly, sprawl out over four months time, with a whole cavalcade of folks to meet, during which you will learn the entire story of Lord Nightingale. Enjoy it for what it is. If you like a well-told story with a hint of intrigue, a bit of adventure,a whole flock of non-stereotypical characters, and a bit of the English nobility, set during a perfectly splendid portion of history, all accompanied by an abundance of laughter, then chances are, you will enjoy Lord Nightingale's Debut, and his Love Song, his Triumph and his Christmas, too! I know I will.	2000-10-17

Whether not-yet-published, or multi-published, any writer would benefit from having this neat little book close at hand whenever the muse says &quot;Write something--now!&quot; Thirteen women, writers of mystery novels all, offer their own unique opinions on a specific topic, valuable to a writer of any genre, not just the mystery/suspense field. <br />Some of these ladies--more well-known than others, perhaps--top my own favorite author lists: Barbara Paul, Ellen Hart and Marcia Muller. They may be on your list, too, but that doesn't mean that the other contributors don't have valuable insights to offer as well. For instance, Anne Wilson writes on place--the all-important setting for your novel. Her setting is a neighborhood in urban London, and the fact that she once lived there herself adds charm and poignancy to her writings, making the setting an inviting place to visit. <br />Joan Drury says she does it all wrong--according to most of the how-to books you may have read, but for her, it works. Being, therefore, the exception that proves the rule may prove to be enormously comforting to the beginning writer who doesn't plot out every step of the novel before sitting down to write. I simply must read her books to find out how she does it--with no advance planning at all! <br />Ellen Hart's novels abound with wonderful secondary characters. More than background or wall-paper, they add the incredible spice to her offerings, which frequently feature the most scrumptious sounding meals--not surprising then, to learn she'd been a chef for fifteen years before taking up writing. Main characters by themselves cannot carry any book for long, and Ms. Hart's short essay on characterization should be required reading for any writer. <br />Research, plots, beginnings, endings. Almost everything you'll ever need to know about writing any novel can be found right here. Well, maybe not. If you want to write really violent or extra-hard-boiled stuff, you won'tfind any help for that here. But for anyone else--lesson one in how to write a book should be--read this book first!	2000-10-17

If you love music, especially that of the piano, then you should definitely make room on your musical bookshelf for this wonderful and comprehensive book. The author, Arthur Loesser, was a well-known concert pianist who was also a gifted writer, critic and annotator--shades of that earlier duallist, Berlioz! This dandy, thick book, detailing the history of keyboards, also includes many of the personalities involved in music-making through the centuries. The hard-cover edition--originally published in 1954--is long out of print, making this trade-paper version even more welcome. Once it's yours, you'll be in possession of nearly everything you ever wanted to know about these keyboard instruments--and then some! And, once you begin reading, you'll find it difficult to put it aside, even for a moment.<br />Each major country had its own beginnings with music and the keyboards that brought that music to life. This book is, therefore, a geographical as well as a musical tour. Beginning in about the mid-1500s and continuing to more recent times, Loesser informs us of the musical progression in Germany, Austria, England, France, and finally the US. Whether you begin with the English in the 1500s or the Germans in the 1600s or the French in the 1700s, you'll be intrigued by the variety of instruments unveiled in these pages for your delectation, as well as his humorous side trips into more human endeavors. (There's an entire chapter [Section Three, Chapter Eighteen] on the use of music in the novels of Jane Austen, for example.)   <br />Loesser skillfully utilizes his dry and frequently wry wit in detailing the history and usage of keyboard instruments, as well as those who merely were the players of them. It's quite obvious that, to Mr. Loesser, the instruments themselves were the more worthy, and he skillfully educates the reader in the evolution of today's piano, including the advantage gained by the availability of steel framing.     <br />There are many types of keyboard instruments, some more well-known than others, but none are slighted in this comprehensive retrospective. In addition, social history is also brought into prominence, as well as those artisans who have moved us with their performances.  <br />Another bravura performance from this noted musician.	2000-10-17

Beware the Laughing Gull  by Lydia Adamson<br />I've rather enjoyed the Alice Nestleton books by this author, but more for the theater background than the cats. Heresy, I know.  I tried one of the Dr. Nightingale books, and found it so hard going, there was no inclination to try any of the later ones about this erstwhile female veterinarian.  Somehow, I missed the first two books in this new series about bird-watchers in New York--Central Park, to be exact.  On further thought, I don't think I did miss much that I'd care to replace. <br />Subtitled &quot;A Lucy Wayles Mystery&quot; I found her to be a rather obnoxious and uninteresting character, once I'd gotten over the surprise of discovering that the first-person narrator wasn't Lucy. Rather, it is a male retired doctor, Markus Bloch, who is at least one sandwich short of a picnic, although long on patience. Lucy and Markus are the eldest of the six-member group of bird-watchers centering the story. Markus is totally in love with Lucy, who either uses or ignores him.  Or talks in riddles over, behind and around him. <br />If you like puzzles in which most of the important clues are missing; if you like being part of what seems like several conversations going on at the same time, although it's usually only the same two folks talking--Lucy and Markus--then you might like this enigmatic book which is over-loaded with non sequitors. I can promise that the solution will come as a major surprise to the reader, as there was not one clue anywhere until about 30 pages from the end of the book. Sorry, but I find no reason to recommend this book, and probably not any of the others in the series, either, if they're all like this one. I haven't the patience that Markus has, to begin with.	2000-10-17

It is one of a  series, featuring Robert Forsythe, a handsome, youngish barrister and his extremely competent woman-of-a-certain-age-Friday, Miss Abigail Sanderson.<br />Sir Amyas Dancer and his children Carleton and Cassandra live at the hereditary country house, The Priory. Also present are his  sisters, Bella and  Sybil who live in the Dower House, and his former father-in-law, Horace, who more or less lives in a tree. In the nearby village lives David Proctor, poet and former model, who is currently engaged to Cassandra, but was formerly the beau of her mother, Viola. Nearing the first anniversary of Viola's death by drowning, Amyas has plans to tear down Mandalay, the Chinese temple on the estate, in order to build a pseudo-Roman ampitheatre, like the one to be found at Chester.<br />To the horror of Sir Amyas, the first occurrence is the discovery of a body.  The murdered woman is Katie Parr, who lived and worked (?) at the Prior for a short time. Or was she Katherine St. Croix, Kay Parnell, or Katerina Padrinski? The threat of blackmail encompasses all the inhabitants of the Priory, even the housekeeper Mrs. Larkin, and her handy-man brother George, neither of whom actually did much around the Priory.<br />Into this quagmire step Forsythe and Sandy, who must peel away the layers of murk that surround the events of the past year before finding a most satisfactory solution. I found this to be a very easy-going, enjoyable story.	2000-10-17

At last, a woman of a certain age, actually having 'hot flushes'! Lady Evangeline Radcliffe is a woman you'll come to love--and laugh with--as you read through her various trials and tribulations during the Christmas season of 1806. <br />This will be the last Christmas for her extended family in the big old Radcliffe House in Brighton. After all these many years, she's finally acceded to the wishes of the Prince Regent and has agreed to sell him her home so he can expand his marvelous Pavilion. However, she has no plans to inform her family of this decision until--oh, perhaps New Year's Eve will do. In the meantime, however, she has a multitude of things to do to get ready for the season. <br />Never married, Lady Evangeline has a nephew, Lord Rupert Radcliffe, who had been happily traveling down the path towards perfect matrimony, until something untoward happened. Now his former fiancée, Chloe, is being mentioned in the same sentence with that bounder Oliver March. Well, Evangeline will just have to get together with her dear friend (and Chloe's father) Admiral Sir Jocelyn Holcroft, to get the errant lovers back together again. Maybe such a conference will even have other results, who can tell? <br />Sir Greville Seton isn't really a nephew, but is still always part of the family gatherings, especially since the death of his mother some years earlier. The poor woman and her little boy had been abandoned by husband and father--for a companion, of all things!--giving Sir Greville a life-long aversion to that category of female. So, who does Evangeline bring to Brighton with her? A companion, that's who. But--what a companion! Miss Megan Mortimer is also an orphan, for whom Evangeline has been searching--lo, these many years.  <br />And then there's Rollo Witherspoon, although to be honest, only Evangeline and Megan can see or hear him. For Rollo is a ghost--a Shakespearean actor of no little repute in his own time, and the guiding light behind/beside Evangeline's annual New Year's production of one of the Bard's plays.  <br />These are the main characters in this delicious seasonal present to us from the always-unusual, always-creative Sandra Heath. In addition to these folks, there is a wonderfully hilarious cast of supporting players, plus a hint of a mystery, and enough love to tangle  several couples in the strings from the mistletoe-bedecked kissing bough. I'd strongly suggest you purchase the book now, wrap it up and put your own name on it, just to make sure that Santa doesn't overlook the necessity of providing you with at least one item that will deliver only pure pleasure as well as a sleigh full of smiles. It's a treat that will last you for many seasons to come.	2000-10-10

Regardless of what prompted you to fall in love with the the sumptuous BBC/A&amp;E production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, you'll love this companion book, which fills in the background to an almost unprecedented degree.<br />Written in chatty style by the producer, Sue Birtwistle, and script editor Susie Conklin, the book begins with the very first idea (in 1986) of bringing one of the most loved books in the English language to the screen once again, concluding with the Christmas wedding of Eliza Bennet and Mr. Darcy.  The six-hour, six million dollar production very nearly brought England to a standstill during the weekly broadcasts, as an estimated 40 million Brits were glued to the telly to see this (then) one-hundred-seventy-eight year old book brought to life.  Almost no detail was allowed to be missed by the scrupulous inspection of the production crew.  A few items were anachronistic, but calculatedly so; most notably, the billiard table, and Mr. Darcy's &quot;cool-off&quot; swim.<br />Each member of the technical staff -- director, casting, costumes -- speaks in his/her own voice, giving reasons for each particular choice made.  Even the horse ridden by Mr. Darcy was auditioned.  Contemporary pictures were used as much as possible to provide accuracy in costume and hairstyle.  Meticulous attention was given to the dancing and the music, of which there is an abundance.  Such minor considerations as the number of musicians employed at each dance venue exemplify the care taken with the production.  Equally so, the food (of which there was more than enough to make the actors as well as the table groan) was specially prepared from recipes of the time by the appropriately-named chef for the series, Colin Capon, who specializes in period food for the BBC.<br />The book abounds with color photos, delineating in great detail how reality-based this production really was. In the end, however, it is the broad shoulders of Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy upon which the success ofthe production rests.  As the physical embodiment of the absolutely perfect Regency hero, he smolders wonderfully through the first three hours, sounding very like the young Richard Burton, when he does speak.  A female of any age can easily be forgiven for wishing his liquid, dark and expressive eyes, as he surreptitiously follows Eliza Bennet around the room, would gaze at her in just that way. In perfect stillness, those eyes express the depth of his longing for Eliza, as well as his bewilderment by that longing, unsuitable as he deems her to be as a marriage partner.<br />Eventually, it is her sparkling intelligence and ready wit that win him to her, but only after she has brought him to his knees by refusing his first arrogant proposal. (Mr.  Firth candidly explains how he arrived at that scene, in the ten-page chapter nine, &quot;A Conversation with Colin Firth.&quot;) Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth was perfectly winsome and charming with her 'fine eyes', a beautiful smile, and an obvious intellect, not readily apparent in her three younger sisters.<br />Although the book doesn't specifically say so, attention must also have been paid during the casting process to those young ladies who were, perhaps, rather more well-endowed in the bosom department.  The necklines of the various gowns are treacherously low, in some cases, which, when coupled with the very vigorous dancing, could make one understand the necessity for the close chaperonage of young women of the Regency.  Not to mention those nearly skin-tight 'unmentionables' worn by all the young men!<br />We should all concentrate on wishing for another such production, especially if it would include the estimable 'Mr. Darcy'.	2000-09-29

Do you remember a time when celebrity was synonymous with personality and not just notoriety?  When gossip was DE-licious rather than MA-licious?  When you hear the names of Vanderbilt, Kennedy, Whitney, Harriman, etc., do you immediately conjure up visions in your mind of huge estates and bigger-than-life sporting heroes?<br />Now in his sixties, Peter Duchin's memoirs quite naturally include the great names and personalities of the thirties and forties, as that was when his famous father ruled the keyboards as America's premier dance pianist. His society-born mother died within a week of his birth, and young Peter himself was given only a 'ghost of a chance' at survival.<br />In a time when godparents had a viable position in life, Peter was therefore wealthier than most; Marie and Averill Harriman took on the raising of the young boy, while his father served meritoriously in the Army, and then toured with his band in order to support himself and his son.<br />There cannot be anyone of any degree of celebrity who is not mentioned kindly in these pages--with one exception, Pamela Churchill Hayward Harriman. Ms Harriman, later the U.S. Ambassador to France, married often and well, and was never a friend to Duchin or his loved ones. <br />Young people of today will only shake their heads in wonder at the tales told here, and the lifestyles, now sadly vanished, of the truly 'rich and famous'. Movie stars, classical musicians, sportsmen, artists, dancers, restaurateurs, politicians, writers--they're all here--even the Vanderbilt's own family ghost!<br />You'll love this look at a world not likely to be seen again anytime soon.

This book has so many good things going for it, the mystery is why it doesn't leave a better impression on the reader. The author is certainly competent; the writing is fresh and clear and witty, although the jumps in viewpoint are a tad disconcerting. The setup is a new and interesting one; a bookstore-sponsored reading group devoted to mystery novels finds itself smack in the middle of a crime that happens practically at the bookstore's front door. <br />Megan Clark, the leader of the group, is a vertically-challenged reference librarian, and a few less references to her height would be greatly appreciated  in future books. Comparing the various crime writers and their sleuths to the happenings in their own little circle provides lots of interesting moments.  <br />The major male character, Ryan Stevens, nearly overdoes the bumbling male side-kick, but all in all, it's an enjoyable book, with a different locale - Amarillo, Texas. The bookstore ambiance is terrific, though! I'd certainly be willing to give the next book in the series a chance. I wish I could have given this book 3½ stars, rather than just 3. It's just not quite up to a four.	2000-09-24

(Certainly Miss Marple would NEVER have had a child without having first been married!)  Had this happened, it would not then be too much of a stretch to also imagine that Miss Magnolia Amelia McLendon could be the grand-daughter or perhaps great grand-daughter of said Miss Marple.  Intelligent, a keen observer of both her surroundings and the people who inhabit those surroundings, Maggie is yet a modern young miss, working on her pre-Ph.d exams, when her life is turned upside down.  A letter from the only aunt she's ever known, her father's Aunt Helena--pleads with them to return to the family home in Jackson, Mississippi, for two reasons. One is the illness of the family patriarch, Maggie's grandfather, who is, after all 80 years old, but the bigger news is that the 27 year-long breach in the family is ready to be mended.<br />For a variety of reasons, all of this family history is news to Maggie, and she urges her father, Gerard, to accept the invitation, and to include both of them in the visit.  He grudgingly accepts, inadvertently setting off modern-day reactions to events of long ago, including a previously unsuspected murder.<br />From the very first person she meets--Adrian Worthington--driver/butler/whatever, but all too intriguing, through aunts, uncle, cousins--the ambiance of the South is never far from the surface, although the family secrets are anything but that. Using the legacy of Miss Marple, (for whom both the author and his characters freely profess a fondness) Maggie patiently sorts through all the events, both current and past, to find the solution. <br />It is rare indeed, for an author to begin with award-winning non-fiction, proceed to highly-praised short fiction, then graduate to a full-length mystery story, but what a pleasure this journey by Dean James provides for us all. Ifyou, too, share a fondness for the works of Dame Agatha, or any of the other past classical mistresses of mystery, you should also enjoy this wonderfully civil, witty and well-written recreation of the classical British country house mystery novel.  It's just been transported to the American South, that's all!	2000-09-14

If this book had been written in the days when a sub-title was considered  a valuable addition to the book, such an addtion to this one might have  been &quot;. . .or,  Sensible Expectations&quot;.   Marriages of  convenience are exceptionally popular in the Regency genre, and this gentle  and charming book clearly demonstrates why.  <br />Will, Baron Ledbetter, is  in need of ready cash to fulfill an unusual codicil to his mother's will.  Prudence Stockworth, oldest of four daughters, quite on-the-shelf at  two-and-twenty, has suddenly found herself a woman of means, having  inherited a fortune from her deceased fiance. Prudence and Will had met  four years earlier when she made her come-out, but Will's very masculinity  had scared her--right into the arms of the unfortunate Porlonsby. That  young man had promptly taken himself off to India to make his fortune, but  died before ever returning home to claim Prudence for his own. <br />Will's  father was known for his impatience; Will is heading in that direction.  Prudence only wants to be loved and wanted for herself, fears, hangups and  all. How these two come to terms with their marriage, each other, and their  friends and family is a remarkably fascinating tale spun by the capable Ms.  Mathews. There is even a touch of mystery, unravelled by the capable  Prudence. <br />The book is really quite sensual, but in such a tender, sweet  way it should not offend anyone. In fact, had I a teen-age daughter, I  would happily hand her this book instead of a dry, non-fiction attempt to  teach her the facts of life. With any luck at all, she'd also learn the  true way to make a marriage work--honesty about and above all things--with  yourself and your mate, and, also, the fine old art of compromise.<br />A  lovely, gentle, satisfying reading experience awaits.

But you don't  have to wonder whatever happened to these stay-in-your-mind characters.  Layton brings many of them into her subsequent books.  <br />LORD OF DISHONOR  didn't follow the above book chronologically, but no matter. It's still a  marvelous--and unusual--vintage.  <br />Amanda Amberley is visiting her mother  when Christian Jarrow, Viscount North stops to visit. Her Mama, the  Countess of Clovelly, who has had a stable relationship for lo, these many  years with the Duke of Laxey, (in spite of having a husband of her own  somewhere else) seizes the moment and misdirects the handsome young man to  the blue room rather then the gray one where he was supposed to be. But  then, the blue room is where Amanda has been tucked away. It's so hard to  pay attention to these details, given the fact that the dashing young lord  has one eye of blue and one of gray. So distracting. Especially when he  smiles just so.<br />Thus begins this tale of two splendidly handsome young  folks, with outwardly not a care in the world. Inwardly, however--ah,  that's a different story entirely.  Being deprived of a loving family, of  course that is the thing each most wants, and yet finds it the hardest to  acquire. <br />Edith Layton is a wordsmith deserving of that term. She uses  words in a way that no other has--or does. She's long been one of my very  favorites, if for no other reason than her incredibly enticing heroes.  Indeed, this book contains my all-time favorite Layton line - &quot;. . .  the only task more difficult than seducing a lad of eighteen might be that  of breathing in and out . . .&quot;	2000-08-22

She can't possibly top this one!' And  yet, she always does. Never have I been so happy to be wrong. <br />Saved by  Scandal is her best book yet. A painter as well as a writer, Ms. Metzger  deftly uses both talents to provide such lively word pictures that  immediately, the reader has a complete visual scene in front of him or her.  It's infinitely more fun than watching tv or a movie, with such humorous  events unveiling before your eyes -- and without a laugh track, to  boot!<br />Yet, the way she uses words is not to be laughed off. She must be  the queen of alliteration, littering the book with tongue-twisters that  would be difficult, if not impossible, to say out loud with any speed. As  in several of her other stories, Metzger prefaces each chapter with an apt  quotation -- but this time with a unique twist. Marvelous.<br />Poor Lord  Galen Woodbridge is jilted for the second time, and by the same  skitter-wit, even. Rather than mope, he decides to fight scandal with  scandal. By George, he'll marry someone guaranteed to drop more than a few  jaws just from the shock of it all. He'll marry the theatrical  singer--Margot Montclaire. Their marriage of convenience turns into a love  match--what else? But not before the hero and heroine stumble through  enough hazards to dowse any budding love affair, yet allowing them to  shelter their growing love for the other, and hold it safe. All around  them, though, the wonderful supporting cast keeps things lively. <br />If  you've had a bad day at the office or wherever, you cannot do yourself a  greater favor than to sit and read one of Metzger's confections. In a very  short time, indeed, you'll find yourself refreshed and ready to tackle life  once more, chuckling as you go.	2000-08-21

I did so want to enjoy this book -- I absolutely adore Alan Rickman! I  should have waited for the authorized version. Much like comparing ground  round to a real steak, certainly a book on which he cooperated would have  more substance and flavor to it than does this one. The problem is not so  much that he didn't participate - it's almost as though the author didn't  really, either.  <br />After the prologue which is very nearly the best part  of the book, Mr. Rickman's life is neatly divided up into sections,  according to years and/or projects. Okay, that's a valid way of doing a  biography, except that here, it's such a mish-mosh. Intertwined with a  sentence or two from each of many reviews for each of his productions, are  slightly longer quotes from friends or co-workers, who were frequently not  even connected with the production being discussed.  These quotes tend to  wander from year to year, as if lost, looking for their rightful place,  just as the reader struggles to recall 'who/where was this?' or 'what  play/movie/radio program was that?' <br />The few pictures used are good, but  why are there such skimpy explanations for them? Several photos are of  groups, and other than Mr. Rickman, almost no one is identified. Strange.  And, of all things, no picture at all from his arguably greatest hit 'Les  Liaisons Dangereuse'.  <br />The author did her homework, that's for certain.  One can only wish she'd had a better grasp of what to do with the  accumulated material -- and better access to a larger photo collection.	2000-08-19

Ginger Barnes is an engaging sleuth, no question.  In her early thirties, married, with two children and a dog, she does the routine juggling act  perfected by so many women of today. Her husband is the head master of a  struggling boy's school in a suburb of Philadelphia, where Ginger grew up,  and still has family not too far away. <br />This is the sixth of the series,  and it didn't quite match the others for quality in my opinion.  One of her  high-school classmates is just about to make it big - BIG! - in Hollywood,  and has come home for their class reunion.  Many of their classmates still  live in the area, and several of the women meet for lunch and even a  sleep-over, just like old times.  <br />But, it isn't really just like those  old times, for which most of them are grateful.  Unfortunately, there were  secrets then, just as there are secrets now, and the fear that some of  these previously unknown facts will become public knowledge leads to  murder. <br />For some reason, this book doesn't have the usual sizzle and  snap with which the author usually embues her work. Plot and characters are  fine, everything works, but still, this book just doesn't quite work. It's  all at sixes and sevens! Maybe it's because of the addition of Frank  Giergielewicz, the policeman assigned to the case.  <br />He's one terrific  guy--or he would be, in some other story. Having become acquainted with  Ginger's husband Rip, and their family in the previous books, Frank made me  nervous. There is a strong sexual attraction between Ginger and Frank,  which really unnerved me, especially in the wonderfully-written car chase  scene (remember the movie classic - Bullitt?)<br />Ah, well, life goes on, I  suppose.  I hope it goes on for Ginger and Rip.  Let Frank find his own  woman.	2000-08-19

She pretty much knows what she wants,  but all-too-frequently gets side-tracked before she gets there. Of course,  the diet gets lost most often. But then, if you lived in Lickin Creek, home  of the prized, over-sized gooey sticky buns, what would one expect.   <br />Tori has left New York City to fill in as editor of the weekly Lickin  Creek Chronicle, and the small town is so vastly different she frequently  finds herself in hot water, with no idea of exactly how she got there, or  how to extract herself.  She has a male friend, the local police chief, but  he's gone away on a temporary assignment of his own leaving Tori to fight  her own battles, metaphorically speaking. Of course, he also leaves her  susceptible to the wiles cast her way by some of the hunky men in the area,  but she manages to control both herself and them while takin' care of  business.<br />The craze of historical re-enactments has come to Lickin Creek,  and a former Congressman volunteers himself to be the condemned man who is  executed by a firing squad during a Civil War weekend. Gettysburg is, after  all, just down the road a piece. But something goes horribly wrong, and the  man ends up dead.  Not only that, but valuable artifacts keep disappearing,  and although it's hunt country, Tori shouldn't be the one being hunted.  <br />It takes some doing, some more sticky buns, and some deep thinking on  the part of Tori as she partakes of the wide variety of small-town  summertime activities, before she finds the key to the many puzzles that  have been driving her nearly bonkers.<br />This is a satisfying book on many  levels - wonderful, believable characters, crisp writing, a different kind  of multi-layered plot. I look forward to reading more of Tori's  adventures.<br />You even get recipes for the sticky buns!	2000-08-19

Taken out of context, to be sure, and certainly the word 'charming'  is a strange one to attach to a book about ghosts, but true nevertheless.  Echo Bodine is one of a family of psychically gifted folks, who utilize  their skills in beneficial ways; healings, readings, ghostbustings.  <br />Along with many brief descriptions of various ghostbustings she's  done--either with her brother Michael--or alone, Ms. Bodine also offers  tips on discovering your own ghost(s) if you have one (or more of them -  they're sociable creatures and generally like to be around others of their  ilk).  <br />If your child claims an 'invisible friend' it may well be a  ghost, but neither you nor your child should be alarmed by this happening,  and indeed, the remedy for convincing the ghost to leave the premises is  quite simple. Even a child can do it. <br />Ghosts are seldom malign; rather,  they're souls who are stuck. They need to go on to the other side, but for  a variety of reasons, have chosen not to. Joined by the persuasive efforts  of her guides, (I'd like to have been told more about these helpful  creatures) and the occasional angel, Ms. Bodine and her brother have rarely  met a ghost they couldn't convince to leave the premises. The most common  cause of such a failure is that the earthling didn't really want the ghost  to leave, and ever accomodating, the ghost obliged. <br />This really is a  delightful little book. I wish it had been twice as long, and told us about  the guides, and a bit more of these most interesting ghosts. We all need to  send positive thoughts requesting volume two, please.	2000-08-18

Although this is a very difficult book to really get into, it's well worth  the struggle for the reader. The writing is crisp and witty, and first  person narration in a mystery (or in anything, as far as I'm concerned)  makes for wonderful reading. Theatre drips from every page, and it's  obvious that the authors know a good bit about that world. So what makes it  so difficult? It's in present tense! Makes for a very strange reading  experience. In fact, I think it must be the first book I've ever been able  to complete, written in that tense.  ('We walk down the street',  rather  than 'We walked down the street.') It's a perfectly valid method, but it  does take some getting used to. <br />Any mystery lover who persists, however,  should find the experience well worth while. And a mystery lover who also  loves theatre will find it an absolute delight. One can only be thankful  that most theatres are not quite so murderously inclined. Morgan Taylor nee  Miriam Tiersky, is an Equity actress plying her craft in Chicago, with its  abundant theatre life.  Beginning with her audition for the part, and  continuing through opening night and then some, we're introduced to all the  hangers-on, the veterans, the novices, the entire panoply of the biz. The  atmosphere is wonderfully detailed. Morgan's wonderfully ditzy family isn't  ignored, either.<br />When the aging actress who is Morgan's audition partner  is found dead backstage, the cases is assigned to Detective Frank Roblings,  and Morgan's life begins to perk up. It is sometimes a bit confusing as to  which one is the real detective, but Morgan's theatrical bent stands her in  good stead, as she slowly but surely figures out who dunnit.  <br />This is a  must-read for theatre buffs, especially, as well as cozy mystery fans. I'm  off to find the next book in the series.	2000-08-14

Before the first page  has been read, she's enticed the reader right into the rest of the story.   Combined with the gift of a smooth, graceful style of writing, she also has  a terrific ear for language and dialogue.  It seems that she never puts a  foot wrong.  <br />I've read more than a few of her category romance novels  and found them to be better than most of that variety of books, and while I  have to admit I don't much care for the new Robb books -- I'll also freely  state that it's because of me, the reader --  not her, the writer.  The  books of hers that I truly adore are the big, mainstreamy type books with  the two contradictory-word titles: Brazen Virtue, Genuine Lies, Public  Secrets, etc.  In my opinion, no writer today does this kind of book any  better than does Ms. Roberts. <br />Nearly every word on nearly every page  convinces the reader that Ms. Roberts has spent a lot of time in a sleepy,  dusty delta town.  Maybe she has, but it still can't get more convincing  than this. <br />It would be difficult if not impossible to imagine a more  unlikely pair of friends, let alone lovers, than classical violinist  Caroline Waverly, and Tucker Longstreet. I defy any woman capable of  breathing to turn away from Tucker, though, and indeed I might almost wish  for a clone of him just for myself.  However, these two disparate souls do  meet, and slowly come to understand and trust each other, even as a serial  killer turns the sleepy little town into one verging on panic. Wonderful  characters inhabit Innocence, Mississippi, making the awfulness of the  crimes seem even worse than they are. It slowly becomes obvious that it's  one of their own who is committing these atrocities. Several times I  thought I knew the identity of the killer, but Ms. Roberts fooled me  completely!  A marvelous, multi-textured, unforgettable book.	2000-08-13

It's amazing how two authors can take the same plot device, and one does  it so very well, and the other--umm, not so well. The one done well was  'Taming of the Shrew' by good old Will, who wasn't afraid to use humor in  the telling. This version, however, just goes on and on and on and on! With  NO humor. Well, that may not be quite true. The author did take great pains  to attach tag lines in nearly every paragraph, saying  'she said with  amusement'. Or, 'amusement lit up her eyes' or something similar.  But that  doesn't make it funny!<br />And--after 240 pages or so of this constant  arguing and bickering and author explanation of the arguing and bickering,  a two-month or so voyage to Jamaica on a fairly small cargo ship, when the  hero and heroine are the only two non-crew persons aboard,(although of  course, as the owner's daughter, she was perfectly capable of sailing the  ship, just as she could run the sugar plantation, and the rum distillery  and the home farm and several other businesses, while the hero was just a  useless aristocratic parasite, although with nice shoulders!), being  ship-wrecked near their destination, and having to cross the island on  foot, complete with her broken something (arm, leg, whatever--I was too  bored and disgusted with her hard-headedness to pay attention by this time)  they're still 'Miss Cantrell' and 'my lord' before they fall into each  others arm's on the last page--with amusement, of course! Bah,  humbug.<br />I've read other books by this author that I quite liked, but this  one just didn't make it.	2000-08-13

If your musical bookshelf has room for only one book about pianos, then it  MUST be this one. It is truly gorgeous to look at, lavishly and lusciously  illustrated with color photos on every page. Once you get past its pretty  face, however, you'll be pleased by the technical content as well.  Presented in easy-to-understand fashion and accompanied by 200+ color  photos of some 150 keyboard instruments, or paintings that feature  keyboards or some other facet of music appreciation, here is the history of  these marvelous instruments from the late 1600s right up to the very latest  electronic machines, all in one, wonderful-to-look-at volume.<br />There are  four double, double-page fold-outs (four-page centerfolds, if you will, but  minus staples) with full-color photos of the best examples of the  craftsmanship being explained in easy-to-understand language. The last one  is my particular favorite, unveiling modern--even futuristic--examples of  art as partner with design and function. On the regular pages, there are  diagrams demonstrating the various keyboard instruments and the sometimes  subtle differences between them. There is a chronology of piano  manufacturers or 'houses' plus an alphabetical description or short history  of them; a discography of recordings made on 'notable' (author's term, not  mine) pianos and a glossary of terminology used in the book as well as the  instruments, plus an index. Truly, everything you always wanted to know  about these marvelous instruments--with the bonus of those wonderful,  scrumptious photographs.<br />It's as much an ART book, as it is a MUSIC  book, or even a HISTORY book. It's on my shelf, and it should be on yours.  I wish I could give it ten stars!  At the very least.	2000-08-13

Not what she would appear to be on  the surface, Sarah was a delightful, prickly daughter of society who  ventured to new worlds when her dearly beloved husband died. The world of  the ordinary person is so far removed from that of the Upper Four Hundred  as decreed by the inhabitants of Society as to be incomprehensible. The  author never mis-steps in showing us both worlds.<br />Fortunately for the  reader, MURDER ON ST. MARK'S PLACE continues this excellent travelogue.  There are so many hardships for young women to overcome in the big city,  when working in a sweatshop may be the only legal way to earn a living. A  living that is barely that, more of a mere existence. When the young women  are mainly immigrants, the way is even more difficult. All too many of them  fall into the trap of becoming a Charity Girl, the name for one who trades  her favors to a 'gentleman' for a pretty bonnet or pair of shoes, or a  visit to Coney Island. <br />There would appear to be one of these men who  wants more than just favors -- instead he wants her very life, and it's the  dedicated Sarah who persists in tying the three women victims to one man.  Before the days of computerization, a murder in one precinct might well be  unknown to the detectives in the precinct right next door. Once again,  Sarah turns to Sergeant Frank Malloy to help her in her detection. Of  course, appealing to Malloy exposes Sarah to his particular burden--his  young son who has been considered a mentally deficient, rather than the  deaf child he really is.  <br />I do hope Ms. Thompson continues this series  so that we may learn more about the efforts to assist young Brian, not to  mention the marvellously-detailed history of New York in this bustling era.  As long as we can tag along while they solve a few more crackling good  mysteries.	2000-08-13

If you remember &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;  from television's golden age, you'll understand the high praise for this  book, because the author was one of the writers of that masterpiece of wit  and erudition -- the only woman so honored. <br />Maggie Rome is a woman that  other women will enjoy reading about: she has a husband, two sons, a dog, a  career, and occasionally fibs about her age--but only by three years.  She  is perceptive, a good cook, although a somewhat recalcitrant housekeeper,  an amateur pianist of some capability, and the star reporter of the Sloan's  Ford Reporter.  The C. B. Greenfield of the title is the owner and  publisher of the weekly paper in upstate New York, a cellist and music  lover, and a man whose way with words and love of puzzles exasperates  Maggie almost beyond bearing.  Sometimes. <br />This is the first of five  stories about Maggie and C.B.,--I'd already read one of the others--and  have every intention of reading the others.  In fact, I intend to search  out all the books and add them to my collection; I need them handy to  re-read when I need a pick-me-up.  I wish that one of the publishers of  mystery stories would bring them out again in new editions.  Unfortunately,  it would be too late for the author, whose pen was stilled in January 1999.

This book was not written in a few weeks or a month, either,  trust me on this.  THIS book was lovingly labored over by its author, and it shows!<br />Trying to describe the complex plot would take up more words than  are allowed in a review, (and truth be told, I'm not sure I could make  sense out it, either) but the author never loses any of the multiple  threads, nor allows the reader to become confused by any of her large, but  delightful cast of characters.<br />The first five pages of Chapter Eighteen  in which the hero explains his current rather complicated romantic  situation to a friend is worth the price of the entire book.  Just those  five pages!  But every page is marvelous. All of your emotions will be  engaged; you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh again at the struggles of  the formerly rakish earl as he tries to convince his bluestocking  sweetheart that he really does want her. And need her. In spite of all the  other efforts being made to convince her otherwise. But indeed, if all's  well that end's well, this book ends just as it should, and you'll be well  pleased by it. <br />This author has the requisite wit and wordsmith skills to  be a major force in the Regency world.

A sterling example of this is in this second book of the new Grace and Favor series.  The first book  ANYTHING GOES introduced Lily and Robert Brewster, whose once-wealthy  broker father committed suicide after the big crash of 1929, rather than  face up to his greed-prompted mistakes, leaving them impoverished orphans.   <br />Their struggles to survive with something of dignity intact is greatly  enhanced by the will of their great-uncle, who leaves them a huge mansion  along the Hudson, and the fortune to go with it--but only after they've  proved they didn't need the money on which to live for the required ten  years in the run-down mansion.  <br />This charming pair of siblings blend  well with the town folks of Voorburg-on-Hudson, having no more ready cash  than any of the natives.  However, they still have to live, so in the  spring of 1932, Lily hatches the plan to convert Grace and Favor Cottage  into an exclusive guest house, at which the drawing card will be a  celebrity of some sort, who is offered a week-long stay in exchange for  mingling with the other guests. Who pay to stay.<br />Julian West, a  best-selling author is the first of these guests, accompanied by his 'man'  Bud, who idolized his hero-employer so much that he accompanied him to  France, and fought beside him in WWI.<br />Period detail is wonderfully mixed  in with this assorted cast of characters, the whole reminding one immensely  of the traditional English County House mystery. The puzzle is a good one  (I figured out the why, but not the who) and the writing smooth. You'll  enjoy your visit, and most likely, look forward to the next occasion, as  well. I suspect you'll find a few old friends when you return. Hope it's  soon!	2000-07-16

It features two of the best male characters to be found in Regency fiction as well as a perfectly delightful, absolutely not run-of-the-mill heroine. An off-beat plot only  enhances this story of an unusual family and how it copes with the very  hard-headed father, Lord Pattinger.  Left a widower with four small  daughters under the age of six, his word has been law for so long that  almost no one has the will--or the heart--to question or challenge him.  Except, that is, for his oldest daughter,  the feisty, red-haired Moira,  still unwed at twenty-six.<br />It is not her wish to be still unwed at this  advanced age, having become nearly betrothed on three occasions. In each  instance, however, after being offered an enticing settlement by the  Viscount, the gentleman in question has instead become betrothed to one of  Moira's sisters.  Her father's reasoning is that in each case, the  gentleman was not worthy of her. After the third such happening, she vows  to marry the very first stranger to cross her path.  The very  first!<br />Oliver Sherrard, now twenty-three, having finished his schooling,  is ready to make his way in the world, but quite undecided as to what or  just where that way might be found. The second son of an earl, his  inheritance is almost nil, however he has hopes of a career as a civil  servant.  But not just yet. Before settling down to life's duties, he  decides to embark on a walking tour of England, for as much a year, much to  the disgust, even chagrin, of his older brother John, now the new earl of  Lydbury.<br />Equipped with a backpack and thirty guineas, Oliver sets off to  explore his world. Unfortunately, he runs into trouble on his very first  night. A local prize-fight is being celebrated at the inn where Oliver  stops to spend the night, and the next morning finds Oliver beaten, bloody,  bruised and left for dead under a hedgerow--minus his thirty guineas, of  course.  Awakened by the rain in his face, and the urgings of a small dog,  he finds his way to shelter--the stables of an apparently prosperous  holding, which, at least, is warm and dry.<br />Of course, poor Oliver in such  a state IS the very next stranger encountered by Moira, who arranges for  the wounded man to be cared for in the best guest room of the house, to the  dismay of her sisters and nearly everyone else, including Oliver. He  pretends to be a vagrant, but agrees to her betrothal charade in spite of  his doubts. Little pieces of the façade each of them has erected as  protection is chipped away as events move forward to a most satisfying  conclusion, ably abetted by various siblings and in-laws.<br />This book  demonstrates very well why Elizabeth Mansfield has remained at the very top  of the favorite author list of so many readers for the past twenty years or  so. This reader hopes she stays there for many more years.	2000-07-15

You'll find yourself nodding your head in agreement with casually-tossed out remarks like  &quot;Here's a dime, go buy yourself a toy at Woolworth's&quot; or you  might find yourself humming the tune to a popular song of the era  --Don't  Sit Under the Apple Tree With Anyone Else but Me-- as it is woven into the  rich texture of this era that serves as a backdrop to this nostalgic,  easy-going and gentle book.<br />It takes you back to a time when patriotism  really meant something, not just the newest Olympics coming up, or the  current one being plastered all over the TV, which of course, was only the  merest figment of anyone's imagination at that time. This was a time of  sacrifice and doing without, of sharing, and all over America, the  inhabitants of small towns like Robinsville, Pennsylvania, banded together  to 'beat the Axis'.<br />The heroine, Kate Fallon, is a working girl, waiting  for her fiancé to return from the Army. An avid reader of mystery novels,  she uses her native intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities to help the  authorities bring a multiple killer to justice. A wonderful group of  secondary characters are so real, you expect to hear them speak out loud at  any moment. <br />Awesome is the only word that can describe the research  exhibited here. The writing and the story should hold the interest of  anyone who enjoys reading something other than fast-paced shoot-em-ups or  car chases. With none of the ubiquitous four-letter words, either. Hooray!	2000-07-13

This title doesn't say very much, and neither does the book, in my opinion. I love books --  reading is one of the joys of my life. As a published author, I also know how hard it is to (1) - get a book published,  and (2) - read reviews of that book. The reviewer almost never sees a book  the way the author does, and that old saying about 'having a book published  is like walking down the street naked' is only too true. <br />But if the book  really disappoints, is it fair for the reviewer not to say this?  Should  the book be given all sorts of terrific accolades, if it doesn't deserve  them? I don't think that's being fair to anyone - reader or writer - any  more than a mean-spirited review is fair, when the only result can be  allowing the reviewer to think &quot;oh! how wonderful and clever I  am!&quot;<br />I kept hoping this book would wake up - come to life - do  something different, perhaps. Unfortunately, it never did. It is NOT awful,  not by any means: it just isn't wonderful, either. There is very little  emotion, and  almost no sexual tension.  In fact, there's very little  romance, although there is a wedding being planned at the conclusion of the  story. But two more distant lovers would be hard to imagine.<br />There is a  crochety grandfather, who wants to dictate to his family; a set of girl  twins, now nearing eighteen, who were unfortunately separated at a very  young age, and have just discovered each other; and the grandfathers  godson, returned from the wars.  All of this could have generated so much  more pizazz. I've read other books by this author that brimmed with life  and activity. Unfortunately this one just sort of sits there.  Patiently  waiting for something, I know not what. Godot, maybe.	2000-07-13

Of those words,  probably 60-65,000 of them are the ordinary, mortar-like glue that holds  the story together. A, an, and, the, it, he, she, they, them, his, her,  town, country, and so on. Everyone uses them. It's the *other* words and  how the author uses them that either makes magic or boredom. Poetry or  hogwash. If only there could be a magic formula to imbue all authors with  the ability to make magic or poetry, instead of the much-more-often found  boredom or hogwash. (It is this latter ingredient that is most responsible  for those books referred to as 'wall-bangers'. I've certainly encountered  my share of these, just as you have.)<br />An author who always spins a tale  of magic and poetry, of such life and tenderness and longing is Elisabeth  Fairchild. She wields her wand of magic once more in this book,  breath-taking in the beauty of its words, as the tale is told of two  victims of a separate Breach of Promise; one the day after the marriage,  one the day of the marriage. <br />Susan Fairford of Chipping Camden, orphaned  young, and husbandless now, must remain in a small rented house in her  hometown, although not in her childhood home, which she still owns, as it  is beyond her capabilities--financial and otherwise. She now raises bees,  and the reader is privileged to learn about this activity, never too much  or too little, but just enough to provide a glimpse into the life and times  of the buzzy little sweet-making creatures. <br />Philip Stone (or is he  really someone else?) enters the village and being told that the manor  house is to let, engages it for a fortnight or two. But soon, because of  the ever-present fascination with gossip (such fascination apparently  unchanged through the centuries) it appears that he is not what or who he  says he is. <br />These two wounded souls must reach out to each other and the  world around them. How fortunate they are to do this in a world made  beautiful for them by the magical and poetical words of their creator. How  very fortunate WE are to be able to read about them. Life is good, indeed.  As long as there are books by Elisabeth Fairchild in it.	2000-07-10

Wicked indeed, is the Machiavellian plotting of the author, and her 'wicked' wit. Wicked, too, are the machinations of the heroine's father and step-son-in-law as  they try to keep the poor widow, Lady Suzanne Phelps away from her  once-and-former love, the near-to-pauper son of the village vicar, Colonel  Stephen Gracechurch.  Wicked, also, was the war that separated them in the  first place, but then, war is always wicked. (What is NOT wicked, however,  is the author's writing talent. That is just simply marvelous.)<br />  Although she had promised to wait for Stephen, her social-climber father  starved her until she submitted to his command to marry an aging knight.  HIS daughter would be the ranking lady of the neighborhood, or else, and  nothing else mattered to the squire. And even though the knight had the  grace to not linger over-long, he left behind his son from an earlier  marriage, Oren Phelps, who, of course, has his own agenda.  <br />Stephen,  back from the wars, wealthy from his service to the Rothschilds knowing  nothing of the truth of the matter, constantly puts himself in the wrong to  Suzanne, necessitating apology after apology after apology. For Suzanne,  unbeknownst to Gracechurch, has been assisting his widowed mother in every  way possible, including having a tumble-down cottage rebuilt for her,  furnishing it, having a shed rebuilt to include stabling for horses and  lodgings for a groom or valet, and bringing gifts of food, wine and bedding  plants.<br />The squire and Phelps try to keep the former lovers apart,  spreading scandalous lies about Gracechurch's honor, having his mother's  house attacked and garden destroyed, having him shot, and even hiring a  London doxie to pretend she is his former convenient, and a climbing boy to  be their 'son'. When that fails, Phelps then chooses another bride for  Gracechurch, and orders Suzanne (who still loves Gracechurch despite  herself)to foster the match.<br />Gracechurch and Suzanne are ever at  loggerheads. Gracechurch's bitter fury with her in the present is a measure  of the depth of his love and his despair in the past, when she wed another.  He's constantly learning he's been in the wrong, and finds himself  apologizing to Suzanne for his false assumptions. Naturally he's unaware  until almost the end, of the pressures brought to bear on Suzanne years  ago, including her father starving her to the point where a physician had  to be summoned, or that Suzanne attempted to run away and join him after  her father refused permission for Gracechurch and Suzanne to be wed.  It  takes the efforts of Suzanne's elderly mother-in-law, plus the Duke of  Wellington, Hannah Rothschild (Nathan's wife), and a few hundred others to  finally reunite Suzanne and Gracechurch.  You'll want to stand up and cheer  their combined efforts!	2000-07-09

Any woman--every woman, any age from 15-? , whatever her marital status-single, widowed, divorced, never-or multi-married, childless or a many-times-grandma will relate to this rollicking saga of a today's woman  seeking marriage.<br /> When successful business-woman Hallie McCarthy  suddenly realizes that she'll celebrate birthday number thirty in four  months, she also realizes that she wants a husband and babies--and in that  order.  She gives no consideration whatever to her new next-door neighbor,  Steve Marris, divorced with two pre-teens, although she does come to accept  him as a friend.  Of course, everyone knows that good friends and/or  neighbors do not lovers make.  In that case, Hallie wonders, &quot;A nice  friendly good-night between neighbors shouldn't curl a woman's toes.&quot;   Should it?<br /> Her best friend, Donnalee, who at 33, wants much the same  thing as Hallie, signs up for an expensive dating service, and convinces  Hallie to join her.  The descriptions of their 'perfect dates' will have  you rolling on the floor, laughing, as you recognize your own variations on  this theme.<br /> When Steve and Hallie connive a double blind-date with  her friend Donnalee (for Steve) and his friend Todd (for Hallie), the plan  backfires when the two friends make instant sparks, recognizing each other  from high school days.<br /> Set during the course of a year, with  intermittent journal entries displaying Hallie's innermost thoughts about  THIS MATTER OF MARRIAGE, you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll celebrate  right along with her, as, in Debbie Macomber's inimitable fashion, she, and  everywoman, triumphs.	2000-07-09

When third son Leigh Nash returns early from the Napoleonic Wars, it is to  discover that he is the new Earl of Winterburn--the inheritor of a wasted  estate. How will he support himself? What can he do?<br />His man of business  suggests selling one of the six benefices in his possession as a means of  raising enough funds to provide the time to think. Instead, remembering the  vision he had while nearly delirious as he lay wounded in a Portugal  convent, Leigh decides to take up residence as a small-town curate in  family-owned property in Rowdene, Wiltshire. He does this partly as a means  of scandalizing his remaining brother and his mother, the countess, but  also as a means of escape from his family.<br />Rosalind Merrifield is a true  benefactress of her village, so much so that she prompts memories of past  legends endowing her with the name &quot;The Rose of Rowdene.&quot; She  battles poverty in her farming world caused by terrible weather, while at  the same time continuing to struggle with her gaming-addicted brother.  Rosalind, at first annoyed with Leigh, soon finds herself confused by her  attraction to him.<br />Almost in spite of himself, Leigh does well in his new  home, providing comfort and counsel to his varied parishioners. Soon, the  families of Rose and the new Earl intervene, with one common thread drawing  them all to a collision course. The resultant explosion changes the  survivors, sending them to a brighter new future. <br />Kate Moore is the  author of several wonderful traditional Regency novels.  She has used her  previous research to good effect here, producing a complex, longer,  well-written historical novel. Alas, it isn't a Regency in the same manner  as her earlier books. I wanted to love this as much as I did those earlier  books, but for some reason, this one had no spark. Although all the  ingredients are there, it just didn't catch fire for me.	2000-07-09

However, if you're looking for solid craftsmanship in writing and plotting plus engaging characters, her books will not disappoint. <br />Robert Musgrave, the  Duke of Wexford, has earned the reputation as a detective duke, so when a  mysterious parcel is sent to the very proper Lady Pamela Taylor, daughter  of the Earl of Gresham, she naturally turns to the Duke for assistance in  solving the puzzle. Who is the real Lady Pamela for whom the expensive  necklace of sapphires and diamonds was intended? Even this seemingly simple  task is bound by the tightness of Society's conventions, and despite her  well-earned reputation for propriety, Lady Pamela must engage in a certain  amount of subterfuge. Fortunately, the duke has a good friend, Sir Cecil  Radcliffe, whose wife is the slightly conniving Lady Anne. She and Pamela  soon become good friends, although Anne's ultimate goal is a bit of  matchmaking. <br />During the course of the search, the gentle Pamela finds  herself besieged by suitors-- the dashing Russian, Prince Radinski, the  suave Frenchman, Comte Reynaud, and the intriguing Englishman, Lord  Raeburn, not to mention the Duke, hitherto not known as an advocate of  marriage--except, of course, for others!<br />There is a wonderful scene of a  waltzing party thrown by Lady Anne to acquaint her friends with this new  dance, certain to become a sensation.

Men go off to war seldom considering the woman they leave  behind, and if you mix in a curmudgeonly father who ignores his now-widowed  daughter, you have the ingredients for a real tear-prompting tale.<br />If  you've ever all-of-a-sudden come to realize something that had been lurking  in the recesses of your mind, you'll identify immediately with the young  duke in Edith Layton's THE GINGERBREAD MAN. Awakened every morning by a  scented memory, he discovers his heart's desire practically under his nose.   You'll feel wonderful all day after this delight.  <br />Have you ever  wondered what on earth was a Syllabub?  Wonder no more.

This one exposes the two most notorious  lovers during the Regency--Lady Caroline &quot;Lady Caro&quot; Lamb George  Gordon, Lord Byron.<br />After a fatal plane crash deprives her of her  parents, Alison Crawford Cunningham suddenly finds herself with four  million dollars readily available to her.<br />She indulges in a seance that  she thinks might enable her to talk to her father; instead it brings forth  the ghost of Lady Caro--a willful, capricious, forgetful ghost.  &quot;It's  been so long,&quot; the delightful shade protests as she laments the fact  that she just cannot remember where she has hidden her copy of the real  memoirs of Lord Byron.  All other copies had been burned by Byron's  executors after his death in 1824. She is also a most persuasive ghost,  convincing Alison to find the memoirs, even if the search includes  journeying to England and buying a run-down English estate.<br />It was a  letter from Caro to her executor about that same copy which led Jeremy  Ryder, a London antiques expert to Dewhurst Manor. The three of them,  Jeremy, Alison and the ghost, take up residence in the old house, each of  them searching for the memoirs, not knowing that the other also knows of  the missing papers. <br />This is an extremely satisfying book--everything you  always wanted in such, with more. I'll bet that if all ghosts were as  charming as Caro, any of us would be happy to be haunted. For myself, I am  just grateful that Jill Jones is not only gifted with a fantastic  imagination, but is a terrific writer, as well. I think you will be, too.	2000-07-08

Of course, it can also destroy.<br />Fire is the catalyst that  brings together Anne Davis, a young woman who is mourning the death of her  four year old daughter, and Thomas Devlin, the firefighter whose wife died  in the fire that has left horrible scars on his face and body. Anne has  returned to the home on an island off the coast of Connecticut in which she  and her sister Gabrielle were born and raised.<br />Anne left the island,  married well, and became a famous jet-setting artist and mother. Gabrielle,  resentful of Anne's success, stayed on the island, married not-so-well,  began a catering business and also became a mother. Gabrielle's daughter,  Maggie, now a teenager, is drawn into a group of rebellious kids, doing  things she doesn't want to do with people she doesn't even like very much.  <br />Anne's husband Mark, who had begun an affair shortly before the death of  their daughter, has come to realize that he wants Anne back again.

Who else could think of a  hero, invalided out of Boney's war in his mid-twenties, who has determined  that if  his chosen bride should be pure on their wedding night, why, then,  so also should HE! <br /> Needless to say, this situation causes Courtney  Choate, Viscount Chase, no little bit of difficulty. The poor man is driven  to hiring a female person to pretend she is his mistress, for goodness'  sake. Of course, the woman he selects, Kathlyn Partland, immediately  decides its because the poor man's injury has rendered him, um, as somewhat  less than a wife would desire.

The loss is more severe for the young  woman; Ashley is the only person who really understands her. He cared  enough to help devise a special sign language for easier communication with  Emmy, who was rendered deaf and mute by a fever when she was barely more  than a toddler.<br /> While in India, Ashley marries and has a son. His  arrival back in England, on the night of a ball--to perhaps celebrate the  betrothal of Emmy to the eligible Lord Powell--sets in motion a tale of  love and intrigue. Ashley, now a widower, finds himself drawn more and more  to the young woman who has indeed grown-up during his absence. Only after  Emmy has accepted the offer of Lord Powell, does Ashley reveal the deaths  of his wife and child.  The betrothal is broken, but still the two lovers  cannot easily bridge the gap of words--words that one cannot say, and the  other cannot hear.<br /> If you can read only one book this year, SILENT  MELODY should be that one. No exceptions, no quibbles. But--be sure to have  a box of tissues handy. If you don't need them, you have no heart.	2000-07-08

There are three separate parts to this fine volume; introduction, script and diaries. The producer of the film, Lindsay Doran, opens the door for us with her wonderful introduction. At age 13, she was determined that not  only was &quot;Jane Austen a very stupid writer,&quot; but also she would  &quot;never, never read one of her stupid books again.&quot;<br />Fortunately  for the rest of the world, Ms. Doran changed her mind, and some twenty-five  years after that first erroneous conclusion, has brought us this  wonderfully witty, and extremely faithful film version of this first novel  by Austen. As producer of the Kenneth Branagh/Emma Thompson film, DEAD  AGAIN, she became acquainted with the woman who was not only a phenomenal  actress, but also a gifted writer-one with a sense of humor  and a strong  romantic bent.  These two qualities had proven to be the stumbling block  over nearly ten years of searching for the right scriptwriter for Sense and  Sensibility.<br />It took nearly seven years to come up with something close  to a shooting script, sandwiched as it had to be between Thompson's many  award-winning acting chores. Serendipity was obviously at work, however,  and eventually, a budget was established, and casting accomplished. <br />Many  of the actors Emma had envisioned in various roles had participated in a  read-through the year prior to the filming; they were all in the film, in  those same roles.<br />While the Dashwood ladies are all suitable beautiful,  it is the men who are truly gorgeous.  (&quot;Repellently so,&quot; writes  Ms. Thompson in the diary portion, referring to Hugh Grant. &quot;He's much  prettier than I am.&quot;) With his look-alike Richard Lumsden, they are  the brothers Ferrar, Edward and Richard, with Greg Wise as the fickle  Willoughby.  Alan Rickman (be still my heart!) brings maturity and virility  to the role of Colonel Brandon. The sets and costumes are  sumptuous.<br />Interspersed with the actual shooting script andthe diaries  are some 50 photographs, 36 of them in luscious color. One script looks  pretty much like another, but this one allows Ms. Thompson's wry wit to  shine, especially in some of the non-spoken words. Of course, not every  scene from the book could be included; the movie would have been more than  six hours had they been. But the essentials are here, along with all the  major characters. Providing testimony to just how perspicacious was the  choice of writer is the number of awards garnered by Thompson for this, her  first film script. <br />The diaries portion begin with a production meeting  on January 15, 1995 and continue through July 9 of that year.  A very small  mention is made of Hugh Grant's visit to California, where he'd gone for  his next film project after the completion of filming his scenes in  England. A final two pages describes the 'location' houses chosen to  represent those lived in by the families in the novel.<br />It may come as  somewhat of a surprise to some readers to discover rather explicit language  in the diaries. In addition to an apparent fascination with the alimentary  process, our Emma has a bit of a potty-mouth, as do some of the gentleman  involved, and their words are recorded, one presumes unhappily, all too  accurately. They seem curiously jarring and out of place in a book  otherwise devoted to the pristine words of Jane Austen.<br />Nevertheless,  this is a lovely, hefty book; one which will bring the reader back to it  time and again.  There is always a new and enjoyable nugget to be mined  from its various depths.	2000-07-07

In 1976, a helicopter crash in England renders three teen-agersorphans just two weeks after their graduation from the American Schoolin London.  Originally from the US, the three--Olivia Segal, the daughter of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust; Annie Aldrich, Protestant from San Francisco, and Jamie Arias, Catholic scion of a great shipping family from Rhode Island--became friends while their parents worked in England.<br /> Banding together, they create a pact--whenever one of them is in need of comfort, friends, whatever, it makes no difference--the other two will drop everything to go to the aid of the one who asks.  ...THE PACT is a riveting, can't-put-it-down novel that will remain in your mind and your heart for a long time after you've read the final page.

If a Regency Romance is a 'seduction with words', as I once heard an editor so describe the genre, then Elisabeth Fairchild is a seductress, par excellence! One can easily become inebriated by the sheer exuberance of her  word-play, let alone the clever plots and endearing characters of her  creation.<br /> Following the success of THE LOVE KNOT about Aurora Ramsay  and her battle-wounded brother Rupert (Rue), and LORD RAMSAY'S RETURN about  older brother Charles,(Rash) the talented author now gives us one of the  two remaining Ramsays--Jack, or Rakehell, whose story slightly pre-dates  that of Aurora. Only Roger, (who is called Ruin because of his poxy  illness) is left out of this series, although all the siblings feature (at  least obliquely) in all the books.<br /> Jack's weakness is gaming, and in  one momentous evening, after having lost the family fortune entrusted to  him by Charles, Jack next wins a wager by playing the cello at a come-out  ball given by a Mushroom, and then, in company with Ruin, while scouting  out a nest of thieves on the seedy, dark docks along the Thames, shoots and  kills his best friend, not entirely by mistake.<br /> To Selina Preston,  the Mushroom's only and much-beloved child, Jack's appearance at her ball  awakens feelings she never knew resided within her. She succumbs to the  charms of the music as well as the charming, red-haired rogue, who turns  her ball from a lonely nothing to the most talked-about event of the  week.<br /> Hired as her music master, Jack eagerly escapes London, only  to fall head-long into a greater gamble--love. Selina also wagers, much  against her better judgment, and not until the last page do we discover who  finally wins.	2000-07-07

I've read several of Ms. Laurens Regency novels and thoroughly enjoyed them; this, however, is a much larger book -- both in size and scope.  Then I got into it, and I thought, Oh, no!   Not another spunky, young, heroine who brings the mature hero to his  knees, because she knows better about everything than he does.<br />Oh, no!   'Tis not that way at all.  This is a wonderful, swashbuckling period piece  for (dare I say it?) intelligent readers of whichever sex who should happen  to pick it up.  It's quite true that Kit Cranmer is indeed a spunky  heroine, but not so terribly young -- early to mid-twenties.  And Captain  Jack, now Lord Hendon, is indeed a mature hero, who brings Errol Flynn to  mind in the blink of an eyelash.  <br />Kit has come back from an unhappy stay  in London to stay with her grandfather, and promptly wanders her way into a  smuggling den based on the coast facing France.  The captain, home from the  wars, is enlisted in a war against the smuggling of spies, but of course,  first he must discern those smugglers from the ordinary contraband variety.   <br />Lots of laughs jump right off the pages of this delightful book, right  along with sexual tension that is believable, for a pleasant change. And  LOTS of it, plus the real thing. This is a very sexy book! Ms. Laurens  deserves all the accolades she's accrued for this wonderful book, and I'll  be part of the long line-up anxiously waiting for her next one.	2000-07-06

Two sets of lovers intersect at the same location in the rugged rural corner of Arkansas where it meets Oklahoma and Texas, in what was once the Choctaw Nation. Both couples are overloaded with troublesome  baggage--emotional and physical--as they are hunted by villains who are  searching for cocaine and treasure. The treasure is a payroll of gold  captured in a train robbery more than a century ago.  One couple lives in  the present, the other in 1872.   As this complex, sprawling novel plays  out, Megan McIntyre Hudson, today's heroine, meets Jake Kenyon. Megan's  husband Peter and Jake's wife Helen are brother and sister, and while on a  charitable mission to South American, were both murdered in front of Megan.  She returns to the States, and the house that Helen has bequeathed to her,  to recuperate far away from the intrusive media and flash bulbs of  Washington, where her father is one of the senators from Oklahoma. <br />Jake  is on leave from the DEA, recuperating from wounds suffered in a drug-bust  gone wrong. His house is just up the secluded roadway from that of his  sister; both occupy land where the tumultuous events of 1872 have left  their happy spirits.<br />Although Megan sees and hears Lydia Tanner and Sam  Hooker, as well as Liddie's brother Peter, Jake hears only Sam's thoughts,  which at first he thinks are only his own longings for Megan. The two  stories eerily parallel each other, with their damaged heroines, and  unlikely heroes. This is not an easy book to get into, but for the reader  who persists, the rewards are more than fulfilling. <br />(Note:  This book  was awarded the RITA [from the Romance Writers of America] for best  Paranormal Book in 1996.)	2000-07-06

This isn't your mother's Regency romance, but that's okay, because you aren't your mother! But then again, given her creativity and her exceedingly inventive mind, anything is possible with Sandra Heath. For a  while in the mid-90s, she ventured a bit away from the traditional Regency  and into the paranormal and the sensual, and sometimes a combination of the  two.<br />HALLOWEEN MAGIC may well be the best of her books of this type.  Drawing on a wide variety of folk-lore and other research, this  entertaining look at a mad, bad witch would have been difficult, if not  impossible, for a non-British native. <br />Meg Ashton, accused of being a  witch, was burned at the stake in 1618. Two hundred years later, she comes  back to the area she had earlier inhabited, and sets out to wreak revenge  on the descendants of those who were instrumental in her demise. Successful  in her vendetta against the Villiers family, Meg next turns her attention  towards Nicholas, ninth Lord Montacute.<br />Goodness will always win out  against evil, and the goodness here is personified by Verity Windsor,  orphaned niece of the village magistrate. Inadvertently, Verity manages to  intrude on nearly every spell being cast by the witch against the hapless  Nicholas. Consequently, the innocent Verity finds herself irresistibly  drawn to Nicholas, just as he is to her.<br />HALLOWEEN MAGIC is a truly  perfect--and VERY sensual Halloween treat.

Sarah Hayden left Spring valley, Wyoming, in the early summer to enter college. She was almost 18 and pregnant, hence the early departure. Unaware of her condition, her parents were hurt, but tolerant. Her childhood  sweetheart, Jim Roice, was confused by her insistence on leaving when  everyone had expected their wedding for years. Not knowing what exactly,  Sarah nevertheless wanted something more than the life she'd known in this  small town. She quietly, secretly arranged for the adoption of her baby and  left.<br />Ten years later, she returns for the funeral of her father and  discovers that, in the way of small towns everywhere, not much has changed.  Her old love Jim has married another local girl, Victoria Tayloe, and they  have an adopted son, Charlie, fondly called Chickadee. Vic's inability to  conceive her own child causes difficulties in her marriage and in her  ability to relate to Charlie.<br />The author lived in Wyoming for many years  (and may still do) and her love for the country is obvious in every  description of scenery and seasonal change, and the slow pace of an  isolated country town is described to perfection. Perhaps that is why the  adult characters have a maturity not usually found in one's mid-to-late  twenties, making frequent references to 'at my age'. Everything is tied up  neatly at the end, making this a good if lightweight, but entertaining  companion for an afternoon at the beach.	2000-07-06

It is a truth universally acknowledged that Jane Austen had a special fondness for scoundrels and scallawags.  How else explain her fully-realized portraits of Wickham (in Pride and Prejudice) or Willoughby  (in Sense and Sensibility) or Frank Churchill (in Emma)?  These rascals  are, in many ways, the most interesting characters in her books.<br /> Now  comes the sleuth alter-ego  of Jane in her second adventure, and in her  journals, she makes no secret of her attraction for the man who is also,  apparently, the head of the local smuggling band and known as The Reverend,  rather than Captain Fielding, the upright Revenue spy.  <br /> En route to  their holiday stay in Lyme Regis from their home in Bath, the Reverend  Henry Austen and his wife, plus their two daughters, Cassandra and Jane,  are considerably shaken up when their hired carriage overturns within a few  miles of their destination.  Cassandra suffers the most serious injury, and  needs immediate attention.  In the driving rain, Jane and the postboy set  out on foot for the nearest habitat -- High Down the home of Geoffrey  Sidmouth.  After an initial not-at-all-welcoming greeting, Sidmouth makes  himself, his staff and his home available.  It is some three days later  that the Austens are able to journey on to Winds, their hired cottage in  Lyme.<br /> Jane's writer's curiosity stands her in good stead as she  sorts through the various miscellaneous characters rampant in Lyme, ranging  from visiting second-rate nobility to smugglers, from retired Naval  captains to French emigrees.<br /> Ms. Barron's  masterful technique in  editing the pseudo-Jane's early diaries and journals is witty, pungent, and  to the point.  Any reader of either mysteries or Regencies, or even  'literature' will delight in this new look at our most famous woman author.   Any reader of Jane Austen's books will easily recognize events and  characters she later put to good use in those volumes bearing her own  name.<br />I particularly like the listing of resource materials used by the  'editor' - they frequently send me haring off in enjoyable new directions.	2000-07-06

Come along on the emotional roller-coaster life of Jared Bellington, the Earl of Alveston, kidnapped and sold into bondage at the very young age of seven, while his six-year-old brother was drowned.  Wicked uncles are such  a hazard to young heirs who are also orphans!  His bondage brings him to  America.<br />There, at the age of twelve, he saves the life of a young boy,  is bought by the boy's father, and meets for the first time, the  five-year-old Della Kensington.  Drawn to each other in spite of the  disparity in their stations of life--their purported stations in life, that  is, for no one believes Jared's story--they grow up as not quite sister and  brother. Jared has but one goal in life; to return to England and reclaim  his inheritance. Only then will he be whole again.<br />By the time Della is  nearing twenty, Jared is finally ready for the journey to his past. He  encounters surprise after surprise, the first being that the current Earl  is that younger brother, Justin, whom he thought dead. The second is the  warmth and sincerity of the welcome offered by the new Earl, and his  fianc&eacute;e, Fiona, from a neighboring estate. She has been promised since her  cradle to the Earl of Alveston, and is perfectly willing to switch her  allegiance to whomever holds the position.<br />Into this mix comes Della, a  young woman wise enough to know that sometimes freedom binds stronger than  chains. As the two couples wind their way through Georgian society new  dangers appear.<br />This is truly an emotion-packed story of star-crossed  lovers. You won't want to put it down.

The era of the 'Great House' and the lavish parties held in them are unfortunately, in the past.  Thanks to Robin Paige, however, we can relive them vicariously, while being afforded the opportunity to solve a crime or  two along the way.<br /> This is the third of a delightful series, set in  an exciting time -- the last few years of the previous century.  Cameras  have already proven their merits, soon it will be motor cars and after  that, who knows?<br /> Kate Ardleigh, an Irish-American orphan, has  struggled to support herself writing 'penny-dreadful's' under the pseudonym  of Beryl Bardwell.  When she discovered to her great surprise that she had  an aunt -- in England -- she set off for a visit.  While she is there, her  aunt dies, and suddenly, Kate is an heiress.  As an independent woman,  however, she refuses to give up her writing.  It is while searching for  background for her novels, that she first meets Sir Charles Sheridan in her  first adventure, Death at Gallow's Green. <br /> Charles is a scientist  and photographer who won his knighthood for a celebratory photograph of  Queen Victoria, and at first, he indulges Kate's curiosity as a novelty.   It doesn't take long for either of them to realize the feelings go much  deeper than expected.  Now, when he is invited to Easton Grange, home of  the Earl and Countess of Warwick along with the Prince of Wales and his  entourage, Charles discovers that his older brother -- the heir -- is  dying, childless.  His plan to propose to Kate is thrown into disarray by a  murder.  Bertie instructs Charles to investigate, eliminating the necessity  to call in the local police, which will certainly dismay Bertie's Mama -  the Queen.<br /> Historically accurate, this is an enjoyable deductive  mystery, which will keep you guessing until the last moment.  You won't  want to miss the final author's notes about the 'Darling Daisy' of the  title (in reality, the Countess) and you'll probably want to investigate  the books in the bibliography.

I do NOT want to read about cowboys, babies and/or daddies. But a prince?  Hmm.  That'll get my attention, every time. I'd never heard of this author before reading  this book, but I'll certainly remember her in the future.  Prince or no  prince.<br />In this instance, the Prince is Rand of Caldonia, and he is of an  age to be married.  His parents issue the standard ultimatum.  Find  yourself a bride, or we'll find one for you.  He's investigated some of the  current 'available's' only to be bored silly for a multitude of reasons.   He needs help.  If you want to find an eligible princess-quality person,  where would you turn for such help?  Why, to the person who is the foremost  royalty-watcher in the world.  She just happens to be Nicole, who is also a  Caldonian, but for the past several years has lived and worked in New York  as editor of Aristocrats, a colorful magazine devoted to royal-watching.   <br />How can she resist the offer to help her country's prince find his  Cinderella?  She can't, and I imagine any of us so appealed to, could not,  either.  Rand is a pretty with-it prince, although the centuries-old family  castle needs a lot of up-dating, especially in the technology area.  <br />Through her sources at the magazine, Nicole finds lots of possible  eligibles, but one by one they're eliminated from consideration, until  finally -- well, you should read it for yourself.  It's a very satisfying  book on many levels. Extra fun if you're a royal watcher, yourself!	2000-07-05

As a Regency novel fanatic, of course I will try to read anything written by an author whose other work I have read and admired. Such was the case when I first heard about PEMBROKE PARK. This was her very first Regency,  and it was NOT published by Fawcett! Rather, it was released by a very  small press in Florida that specializes in a particular kind of novel:  novels of particular interest to lesbians, gays, and folks sympathetic to  their interests.  It was listed at Amazon, and is still readily available,  although first published in 1986.<br />To my great pleasure, and no little  surprise, I found this book to be  a 'perfect' Regency, following the  habits and mores as we've come to know them, of wealthy, titled country  folk, who take great exception to anything that disrupts their notion of  how life should go on.  All the standard characters and situations are  here, deftly described in Ms. Martin's usual humorous way, but with the  notable exception that the heroine ends up with--another heroine.  There is  also a gay romance that ends well. It is a very gentle love story, not at  all titillating, so if you're looking for exposition into lesbian habits  you won't find it in this book.  But if you want a well-written, well-told,  well-thought-out and witty story, set in this favorite era, I don't think  you'll be unhappy if you read this book.  I highly recommend it, in fact,  because of these very reasons.	2000-07-05

It doesn't hurt any that the about-to-be-former rake is the son of a  Duke, and we just won't pay any attention to the fact that he and Joia get  along like, well, oil and water.

It's the Squire and his wife who end up raising the boy, after  their daughter dies suddenly.  Evan has always been like the son the Earl  never had, and a father can't be blamed for hoping that his Holly might  someday -- but, then again, sometimes it's the older and wiser heads that  prevail.<br /> And Merry?  Hers is a Silent Knight.  Well, Sir Max can  speak, but hesistantly.  His bravery was never in question, until he met up  with the red-haired, green-eyed elf.  And that son?  Well Noel might have  been -- but then, as the earl read from the good book during his Christmas  lesson, &quot;And lo, unto them that day a son was born . . .&quot;  What  matter that the son was already some ten years old, and born on the wrong  side of the blanket?<br /> THE CHRISTMAS CARROLLS is Barbara Metzger at  her very best.

James states in her preface to this engrossing book, &quot;we have what is in effect an epistolary autobiography&quot; of the young Dorothy L. Sayers, from age five to forty-three, when the author  became the household word that she is today. (Later letters comprise volume  two.)<br />The earliest letters are sprinkled with references to poems, plays  or short stories that she had written, in any-or all-of the four languages  at her command (English, French, German and Latin.) She fell madly in love  with the theatre, not to mention the leading men of the era. Before she  reached the age of thirteen, she had read (in the original French)  The  Three Musketeers, and from that time on, referred to her familiy and  assorted locations by their assigned names from the book. She took for  herself the identity of Athos. At eighteen, her headmistress announced that  Dorothy had come top in all England in the Cambridge Higher Local  Examinations with distinction in French and spoken German. The following  year she entered Somerville College at Oxford.<br />Men as men didn't enter  her life until she had completed Oxford. She fell in love only once, but  they couldn't marry due to multiple differences in values. Subsequently,  she had a short-lived affair with another man, who was the father of her  only child, a son raised by Dorothy's cousin. Their roles were reversed in  the boy's life; the cousin was his 'Mum' and Dorothy his aunt.  Not until  after her death did the truth come out.<br />These letters bring to vivid life  the enigma who was known world-wide as the creator of Lord Peter Wimsey,  the perfect foil.  She couldn't afford a luxurious flat, a Daimler, or an  Axminster carpet; she could, however, provide them for Lord Peter. She made  him and his family and his possessions incredibly real for her millions of  readers. <br />Any devotee of Lord Peter Wimsey will be exceedingly grateful  to Barbara Reynolds for her years of loving care in sortingthrough and  editing these letters of one of the world's great novelists. We can but  wait-patiently-for volume two, in order to learn how Dorothy wore her  hard-earned and well-deserved fame.	2000-07-04

The current World Credo. <br />These words are found on page 48 of the paperback version of this book, published in 1980.  Such perception!  Such prescience!  And how completely  unfortunate for those of us who like to read something just a tad different  from the latest techno-thriller. <br />This particular book is the second of a  series of intelligent, witty, off-the-beaten-path mysteries set in the  northeastern part of the US.  It could almost be called a Nick-and-Nora  type of book, except that the 'Nick'  of this book is the erudite and  somewhat crusty Charlie Greenfield, owner/editor of Sloan's Ford (NY)  Reporter, a small-town weekly newspaper, and the 'Nora' is Maggie Rome,  girl--well actually--star woman reporter. <br />There is no sexual hanky-panky  between these two, however, as Maggie is happily married, and mother of two  nearly college age sons. Charlie is a widower, and quite probably a  misogynist. Or if not that extreme, he is content without a romantic  interest.<br />In this book (and I'm off to the library to find the first one)  the annual summer vacation of the newspaper office staff coincides with the  opening of Tanglewood, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.   Considering that Charlie and Maggie are two thirds of an amateur string  trio, their shared love of music proves the final enticement and prompts  Charlie to accept the invitation of an old friend, a violinist in the BSO.   Maggie is roped into driving Charlie to Tanglewood as his car is suffering  a possibly fatal illness, and the two set off in her Honda for a supposedly  brief, calm and musical holiday.<br />Once arrived at Wheatleigh, the  Italianate mansion that is now a luxury hotel located almost adjacent to  Tanglewood, an amazing assortment of characters are introduced. Some of  them are important to the story, some are not, but they'll all keep your  interest.  Unless, of course, you are a devotee of the above mentioned  techno-thrillers.  If you prefer an icy glass of lemonade, a hammock on a  summer's day, and an entertaining book to while away the hours, you'll not  want to close this book before you've come to the startling  conclusion.<br />All the clues are laid out neatly, as are the red herrings.  If you're a fan of Ravel or Brahms, so much the better.  <br />Consolidation  is not better than diversity! To think this book might not ever have been  published.  Horrible thought!	2000-07-04

Daughters of the Duke and Duchess of Somerton have, in the past, never married less than  an earl, and this daughter will be no exception!  In their haste to have  her married, Sarah's parents, the present Duke and Duchess, find what they  consider to be a suitable candidate -- Fitzwilliam Hornsby, Viscount  Lyleton.  Actually, they found his parents, the Earl and Countess of  Lavesly, who were, coincidentally, also looking for a marriage partner for  their recalcitrant child.<br />Unfortunately, this young man is much more fond  of clothes, the ton, gaming, and any number of other things than he is of  the idea of marriage, let alone the actuality.  It was something he knew  he'd have to do someday, but preferably not for another ten or twenty  years.<br />The two sets of parents contrive a summer visit of some two dozen  acquaintances at the Viscount's own estate, Charlisle, so that the two  young people can meet, get accustomed to each other, get betrothed, and  then get  married a month later.  Nothing to it!<br />Neither set of parents  nor the young people themselves, reckon on the disruption caused by the  butler.  John Rawlins is the son of a Duke, but from the wrong side of the  blanket.  In aid of his friend, Fitz, he assumes the office of butler for  the duration of the summer party at Charlisle.<br />As the young couple  contrive to become un-betrothed, the butler is not the ONLY one who  laughed!  <br />How sad for the rest of us that the author is no longer  writing these books!	2000-07-04

Embarking on a new Gregor Demarkian story by Jane Haddam is like going back home to the neighborhood you left all those years ago.  Cavanaugh Street in Philadelphia is still an Armenian-American enclave, but more  Armenian now than it was all those years ago when Gregor was a small boy  living there with his parents.  Even though it's been gentrified, many of  the same people are still there, or if not, their children and/or  grandchildren.  Oh, there's a few new faces, such as Gregor's friend,  Bennis Hannaford, the best-selling author of fantasy novels, and Father  Tibor, who escaped the Soviet menace -- finally -- but it's still a  family.<br /> Of course, in any family setting, there are always  unpleasant aspects, but Gregor --a widower of 60 -- has lost the impatience  of youth, and is content to think his way through the puzzles he is so  frequently presented with.<br /> DEADLY BELOVED is the story of marriage;  Donna Moradanyan is about to marry Russ Donahue, finally, while in another  suburb of Philadelphia, another marriage unwinds, surrounded by several  others in precarious condition.  In the gated community of Fox Run Hill, a  husband is discovered shot to death in his bed.  The most puzzling thing,  however, is that the huge house has been stripped of everything that  belonged to his wife, Patsy MacLaren Willis.  A pipe bomb destroys her car,  but she was not in it.  Another bomb destroys the punchbowl at a political  gathering, injuring Bennis and a woman who went to college with Patsy.  The  politician is yet another classmate.  There are too many women, here.<br />  Like a well-maintained and classic Rolls-Royce, Gregor moves in stately  fashion through the labyrinth of deaths and injuries, sorting out the clues  and non-clues with the help of Homicide detective John Jackman.  Just in  the nick of time, too, so Donna's wedding can proceed without a hitch.  An  invitation by Jane Haddam is one you shouldn't turn down - you'll miss a  marvelous adventure.  Characters, plot, and the writing are all  first-class!	2000-07-04

Since the days when the fear-producing words  &quot;Here be Dragons&quot; were inscribed on ancient maps, the lure of the invisible has drawn men to the water with their ships. The Great Lakes, seven of them if you include  Lake Champlain, along the New York-Vermont border, (and Lake St. Clair,  between Lakes Huron and Erie) are no strangers to the unseen.<br />Frederick  Stonehouse, a noted scholar and author of thirteen prior books about the  Great Lakes and their maritime history, encountered tales of the paranormal  throughout his years of research.  Nonplussed by them, he tucked them away.   In his preface, he confesses to 'not knowing exactly what to do with these  stories'.  Eventually, however, there were so many of them, he began to  look at them with a different eye.  He found that they assumed  credibility  because the people who told the tales believed so strongly in them.   Beginning with the Gibralter Point Light on Lake Ontario in Toronto, one of  the oldest lighthouses on the Lakes, right up to yesterday, when the author  himself experienced -- something -- you'll be fascinated with this book,  and its many illustrations,  glossary, bibliography, index, and the  thoroughly enjoyable appendix.<br />Tales such as the captain who continued to  be a part of the crew on his beloved ship, and who saved it from certain  disaster, to the list of boats carrying the same name -- Ontario, or a  variant thereof --  all of whom went down in a five day span in October,  1874.  Superstitions abound -- a Friday departure spelled certain disaster,  for instance, as did cats, blasphemy, whistling, or women on board.   It  must be stated, however, that many of the disasters cited here occurred  during the 1800s and early 1900s, primarily in the days of wooden  ships.<br />However, steel hulls and electronics cannot guarantee safe  journeys, either, as in the case of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  During the  launch, several events happened which, one hundred years earlier, would  have labelled the ship a certain jinx.  Modern science has pretty much put  that idea to rest, and in recent years, divers and scientists have come up  with possible scenarios to explain the sudden disappearance of the  ore-hauler in the storm of November 10, 1975.  What they can't explain  however, are the oddities surrounding succeeding events, all involved to  some degree with the Fitzgerald.  For instance, the wardroom bell falling  off the wall of the Canadian submarine tender, Cormorant, the ship sent to  rescue the Fitzgerald's bell and bring it to the surface, where it is to be  part of a memorial to the sunken ship and her crew, all of whom went down  with her.  The Cormorant's captain said, &quot;It's never fallen before,  and we've been through 30-foot seas with it!&quot;   Haunted lighthouses,  superstitions, ghost ships, ship board and underwater ghosts, lakeside  spirits, sea serpents and other creatures, and messages from beyond are the  sections of the book.  The oldest ghost ship is the Griffon, from 1679, and  the Sieur de La Salle, which left Green Bay on September18 of that year  bound for Niagara, and was never heard from again.  The old-timers call  this sailing off 'into a crack in the lake', and literally hundreds of  ships have taken such a voyage in the years since the Griffon.   Haunted  Lakes is an enjoyable look at a variety of unexplained, miscellaneous  phenomena, such as  ghosts (of ships and other creatures, including  lighthouses);  sea serpents and other mostly unseen things.  It's a  fascinating look at the ever-present subject of ghoulies and ghosties and  other things that go bump -- or splash -- in the night.  There's even a  ghost horse!  True.  Louie by name, the poor creature was abandoned on what  was then called Yeo Island in Georgian Bay, after being shipwrecked in  1828.  His owner promised to rescue him, but for a multitude of reasons,  didn't.  So many mariners told of seeing the ghostly white horse, still  waiting patiently, the island eventually became known as Horse Island.  <br />This is not the scariest book you'll ever read, but on a cold, dark and  windy night, when you're all alone --  perhaps another book would be a  wiser choice.  This one is a dandy companion for a nice, bright sunny day  -- preferably beside a calm, peaceful lake.	2000-07-03

To be sure, it could only be a LONGER, more in-depth Regency romance by Mary Balogh.  This was the first in a new series from Berkley as just such  a lavish, extremely fulfilling treat.  It is NOT a historical disguised as  a Regency, but the very real thing.<br /> From her first greeting to   Viscount Rawleigh, Catherine Winters finds herself annoyingly attracted to  the man, whom she had initially taken for his twin-brother and her near  neighbor, Mr. Adams.  The Viscount, on the other hand, makes erroneous  suppositions about the lovely widow, and during the whole of this long and  lovely book, sparks fly between these two strong and independent  characters.<br /> Against his better judgment, the Viscount accompanies  his brother back to Bodley-on-the-water, for a change of scenery.  His  brother's wife is determined to make a match between her younger sister and  the handsome Rex, refusing to believe he is not interested in the untried  chit.  He is equally determined to avoid her snares, protecting his heart  from further damage, it having been broken once already.<br /> Catherine  is obviously a lady, or at least with some pretensions toward gentility, if  a bit young to be a widow at the age of five-and-twenty. Content with her  current existence, she has a dog for companionship, and enjoys the society  (although knowing it for exactly the condescension  that it is) of the  occupants of the small village, from the Viscount's brother to the  garrulous rector.<br /> Of course, Rawleigh believes the toothsome widow  to be eminently beddable, based on little more than a smile or two, and  pursues his goal with admirable intent.  She must certainly be interested  in him, for how else could she so readily tell him apart from his identical  brother?  No one else ever could!  No matter how impregnable any woman  believes her fortress to be, the gates may nearly always be opened by the  right key.  He inadvertently compromises her; they must marry, and all the  long-held secrets come tumbling out.<br /> As usual, Mary Balogh does not  disappoint the reader; this is truly (to borrow a word coined by her  original publisher) a SUPER Regency!	2000-07-03

Trust Sandra Heath to find yet another way to incorporate her three fictional loves -- Regency, paranormal, and super-sensual -- into one terrific read!  SUMMER'S SECRET is a trip to the past through hypnotic  regression -- hip, funny, delightful.  And sexy.<br /> Six months after  the accidental death of her lover, a bout with pneumonia, and being  diagnosed with diabetes, Summer Stanway of Massachusetts, visits her only  close relative, her sister Chrissie, who lives in England.  Chrissie's  husband Andrew is a hypno-therapist, and, thinking to humor the  recuperating Summer, he agrees to try hypnosis.  <br />  Summer finds  herself in 1807 as Olivia Courtenay, a young widow, meeting a friend of her  former husband at the Black Lion Inn at Tetbury.  She is energized with  good health and exhilaration, especially after a late-arriving gentleman  climbs down from his obviously expensive carriage.  He is the very image of  her late lover, Jack.<br /> But just then, Andrew brings her back to the  present.  Arrgghh!  After begging for one more attempt later that night,  Summer places a tape recorder under the sofa, and later, in the middle of  the night, tries Andrew's methods for herself. <br />  Two hours of mad,  passionate love with the mysterious Brand convince Summer she must journey  again and again to the past, where she finds family and and mystery, too.   But when the batteries go dead in the tape recorder, Summer is flung into a  coma, and begins to do some serious thinking.  One more trip to the past  helps her decide the path she must take.  I'd probably do the same, and  I'll bet you would, too.	2000-07-03

So, succinctly, does the author describe the three main characters in this remarkable debut book.  Paul Armstrong and Mike Fitzgerald were childhood friends in Staunton,  Virginia.  During their junior year of high school,  Kate Moran moves with  her family to Staunton, and becomes the third of this trio, whose lives  will intertwine-forever.  <br /> Both men fall instantly in love with  Kate, but it is the baseball-player Paul who captures her heart, and when  he has achieved the majors, they marry.  Almost immediately, Kate discovers  the world is not as she had thought it would be.  Paul wants her at every  home game-in San Francisco, where they've bought a condo she hates-but  refuses to allow her to travel with him or the team.  When they decide it's  time to have children, Kate discovers to her dismay that she is not capable  of providing him with the son for whom he wishes.<br /> Mike has combined  architecture and historic restoration into a lucrative and high-image  career, but his personal life is nearly always in ruins because there is  only one Kate-and she isn't his.  He maintains a home in Staunton, as does  his older sister Sheryl, and her son Matt, also an up-and-coming  ball-player.<br /> As the book opens, Paul is killed in a flash-flood in  Arizona, during spring training.  Kate returns to Staunton, to find comfort  and meaning to her life, to Paul's family home across the street from  Mike's.  As layer after layer of the lives of these five people are  exposed, new revelations threaten all of them.  Only after risking  everything are they able to discover the way to the future.<br /> You'll  not soon forget this book or these people-if ever. Calling it a 'romance',  however, is a violation of the &quot;Truth-in-Labeling&quot; Laws. It is a  a LOVE-story par excellence.  Bring on the tissues!  I would have given  this book more stars, had that been an optionn.	2000-07-03

Stephen unfortunately falls under the spell of card-games, and loses their  heirloom, the ruby-encrusted Holland tiara. Of course, the doyenne of the  stage, Fleur Fitzgerald thinks it should be really be hers, although no one  in her family has ever been able to prove legal possession.

Not since the first Frost the Fiddler books, and before that the Paul Meyer books, have lovers  of classical music been able to indulge their love of music and mystery  simultaneously.  What a find!<br />Phoebe Angelopoulos Mullins, daughter of  famous pianist Yannis, and widow of conductor Mischa (who was really  full-Irish!) finds herself at 48 needing to find a career for herself, to  earn her own money in her own right. Perilously, she learns a bit about  WordPerfect, learns to drive a car, sub-lets her apartment in New York and  sets off for a summer job in the Hamptons, which dematerializes before she  gets there.  <br />But then, there appears on the horizon the Varovna Opera  Colony, under the aegis of Anna Varovna, former soprano star at the Met,  and Phoebe has found her summer home. Having spent her adult life (so far)  meeting crowds of people, she uses the old trick of assigning pet names to  folks to make future identification easier. Thus we get to meet the  Jamaican Baryshnikov - Jason Lee Jones; the White Queen - Amanda St. James,  and the Red Queen - Rita Michaels. Rita is married to the Stage Director -  Theo Morse. The 'Piano Man', Larry Peterson, is a composer in addition to  being the conductor. Various other personages enter and exit: Jenny Allen,  girl of all work, Gerta Hofstetter who has been with Anna longer than  anyone can remember, and of course -- the tenor! -- Stefan Kowalski.  The  baritone of the title is Frank Palermo, whose death is caused by an  allergic reaction to penicillin.  Who knew?  Who could have used this  information in such a way? And why?<br />Suffolk County Homicide Lieutenant  Saul Freed and his assistant (The Gaughin Princess), exotic Claire Delgado,  are called in to untangle the multiple threads of this engrossing mystery  novel; threads which include plagiarism, cults, professional jealousy -- as  well as the other kind -- and even remnants of the Holocaust. Inthe end,  however, its Phoebe's memory that pulls the pieces of the puzzle together,  allowing her to correctly interpret the clues that have been misunderstood  by everyone else -- including the Lieutenant. It may sound complex, but is  no more so than a Mozart score, and will be as satisfying to the mystery  lover, as the musical one is to the music lover!<br />Set to the staging and  words of Così fan Tutte by Mozart and Da Ponte, even the prodigy himself  would have loved the word-play and subtle humor with which this book  abounds!  For myself, I can hardly wait for Death of a Pooh-Bah, in which  Phoebe has moved upwards to the position of stage manager for the  Northampton Repertory Company.	2000-01-11

The well-spring of creativity that continues  to bubble within Sandra Heath is displayed with terrific effervescence in  her October book &quot;The Famous Jack-o'-Lantern&quot; from Signet.   <br />Miss Polly Peach is an heiress; her untitled father owned Peach's Bank  in London.  Unfortunately, Polly's parents were killed in a carriage  accident, and she is consigned to her Uncle's guardianship.  Uncle is  Hordwell Horditall, a wealthy if parsimonious country gentleman who is  infatuated with titles and the nobility.  He determines to wed his ward to  the impoverished Lord Benjamin Beddem, the second son of the Duke of  Lawless, but who claims that he will be the next duke.  <br />Lord Beddem has  a sister, Lady Georgiana Mersenrie, who has been carrying on with Sir  Dominic Fortune, but suddenly struck by the desire for a grand title of her  own, throws him over for Algernon Lofty, Marquess Hightower, heir to the  Duke of Grandcastle.<br />From Horditall House, and sundry other locations,  all the parties gather in Bath to celebrate Halloween along with the Duke  and Duchess of York, and their Russian guests the Count and Countess  Gotenuv.  And not to forget - or ignore - the brownie population of these  estimable residences.   You see, every home in England is protected by its  resident brownie - so named because of the color of its fur.  With a long  tail that can cause severe damage if the brownie becomes engraged, (thus  becoming at least temporarily, a boggart) these mostly benign little  creatures remain invisible, unless a certain degree of trust is established  with at least one of the residents in the home.  The major function of the  brownie is as keeper of the keys, kept on a belt worn around the waist.   This belt must be protected at all times, for if  a human should capture  the belt, the brownie goes right along with it, and remains a subservient  captive, even if against his/her will.<br />The scene is thus set for mayhem  in Bath's Royal Crescent, where Lord Beddem has relinquished his  middle-location townhouse to Sir Dominic, while he (Beddem) moves to No. 1,  along with Uncle Hordwell.  The Horditall's brownie, Bodkin, accompanies  Polly to Bath, where he meets up with Ragwort, the brownie in No. 1.  They  are each busily searching for their lost lady-loves; Bodkin's Nutmeg has  been kidnapped (brownie-napped?), whereas Ragwort's Caraway has refused to  play second fiddle to Ragwort's love of the grape.<br />The only warning I  would offer to a reader of this book is to read it while in your own  solitary company.  Your entire repertory of laughs, guffaws, giggles and  other expressions of mirth will be well-exercised while reading about Polly  and Dominic, and their sometimes invisible helpers (?) with the resultant  havoc, and such may even prove embarrassing!	1999-09-04

Once you've achieved that -- go ahead and open the  book.  You'll not be disappointed.<br />This is a story that could not take  place other than in England for a multitude of reasons; most noticeably the  Roman history and the even older standing stones - in this case those of  Avenbury.<br />Poor Marigold Marchmont, seduced into marriage at the age of  sixteen, and now widowed at the age of thirty, and pushed - literally - out  of her inheritance, as well as that of her son's, by her husband's younger  brother, Falk Arnold.  Even his family attorney, Mr. Crowe asserts that  Marigold's first marriage was a sham.<br />Having had to wait some two hundred  years for the correct circumstances to arrive, Falk sets out to claim an  earlier inheritance with the aid of a Druid charm.  Falk (a version of  falcon) has birds in his family tree, and all around him.<br />Lord Rowan  Avenbury's heritage, on the other hand, is trees, and between them the  forces of nature are mighty indeed.   Much to his amazement, and that of  Marigold, who has charms and powers of her own, of which she is yet  unaware, they suddenly find themselves married - to each other, irritating  Alauda, Falk's sister, who had been very friendly indeed with  Rowan.<br />Marigold's son Peregrine attends Eton, where his best friend is  the young Percy Bysshe Shelley, whose propensity for chemical experiments  blends nicely with his knowledge of ancient Druid curses, especially those  in the Avenbury family.  When they come to recuperate from the chicken pox  (naturally!) at Avenbury, Sir Francis Drake - a truly demon duck - joins  them, and the fun begins.<br />Spells, charms, wizards, birds galore, and an  abundance of humor will delight you as you rapidly turn the pages of this  enchanting book.  In the process, you'll learn more about English avian and  forest life than you ever dreamed possible -- but in a most enjoyable  fashion.  You won't soon forget Sir Francis, either.

This is one terrific book, not exactly romance, but most definitely historical, about Sarah Lennox and her romance with the young George III, mostly while he was still just prince.  It's not a quick read (425 pages) but well worth the effort.  Although there are love stories in the book, it is not a romance as that term is used in today's book  categorization. (Indeed, the spine says simply FICTION.)  The emphasis is instead more on overall story and history - which is very well researched.  Sarah Lennox was a woman well before her time, who suffered greatly because of who she was; not good enough for a King, but too good for a commoner, according to her family.<br />In the book, Sidonie Brooks, a divorced, modern-day female musician specializing in harpsichords and other older instruments, moves into a flat on the street that backs up to where Holland House once was. <br />She acquires a harpsichord - a gift from George III to Sarah - without knowing any of the history of it!  or them, until she falls through a time fault.  These journeys take four hours of today's time, but show her only minutes of the then time, and the trips move the past forward in an non-proportionate way.  The first is when Sarah is barely fourteen, and they end when she is an elderly lady, whereas the contemporary story occupies only a bit more than a year of today's time.  These trips may happen anytime and anywhere - providing Sarah was, at least once in her own lifetime, in the same place the musician is, in today's world.  <br />The two stories are set against each other; Sarah and her loves in the mid 1700s, and Sidonie battling her pompous ex-husband while enjoying her burgeoning career and the travels it brings, plus the new men in her life.  <br />I found this to be a totally engrossing story, one not easily forgotten.	1998-07-24

This tid-bit of reality was the inspiration for Indigo, the third book by Ms. Jenkins.  Hester Wyatt is the child of the marriage between these two slaves, and after the death of her father, who had been free until he first saw her mother, the two females are sold, separately.  Hester ends up in South Carolina on an indigo plantation, where, after years of working with the dye, both hands and feet retain the deep blue color, indicating their type of servitude.<br />In the middle half of the 1800's, the slave-stealers fought bitterly against the slave-catchers, one of the factors leading to the Civil War.  In 1858, Hester is a 'free' young woman of 24, who r! uns a way station on the Underground Railroad in southern Michigan.  One bitterly cold night, she is landed with a 'stealer' who has been brutally beaten before his rescue.  He needs time to recover before setting out again, and in the forced confinement, the dark-skinned Hester and the light-skinned Galen discover love---and a world that neither of them has wanted.

The person who grew up wearing that name is now 30, and knows that she was adopted as a child.  Could that be why someone is trying to kill her?  From a winter evening in Cleveland to a State Travel Office in Colorado, a very exclusive hospital in North Carolina, and Washington DC, with a stop in 1969 Long Island, you'll be swept along with Jessica, who may instead really be Liliana.  With the help of her former husband Dan, who after all, brought her the papers that had been hidden in her adoptive parent's attic, Jess/Lili sets out to discover her own identity. Which of them is the target?  Told in engrossing and parallel chunks of narrative, t! wo additional interwoven stories evolve; the woman, Constance, who for 26 years has lived in that hospital waiting to not be 'mad' anymore , and Supreme Court Justice Nominee Victor Rodier, who planned every last detail on his march to the Court.  You'll enjoy this satisfying, fast-paced sizzler.  Then you can ponder the real mystery here.  Why isn't this author on the NYT list?  Beats me.	1998-07-21

The gift of the story-teller is to enable the reader to experience the same wonder and awe of the 'what-if?' as does the writer at the moment of inspiration.  In her third book, Jill Jones demonstrates anew both her superior imagination and writing skills.  <br /> If you've ever wondered what Scotland in the 1650's was like, here is perhaps more than you really wanted to know.  For the very 1990's television personality Taylor Kincaid, the experience comes as part of her search while filming the lore and legends surrounding the Honours of Scotland  which were part of the Majesty surrounding Mary, Queen of Scots. Did Mary really provide an additional treasure to accompany the crown, sceptre and sword?  If so, where is it?  And, what happened to those Honours during the Civil War?  Further, what -- if anything -- does the rock structure known as the Ladysgate have to do with the long-deposed Queen?<br /> Taking her crew from New York to Scotland, Taylor uses the opportunity to ! check out an inheritance from a relative of whose existence she hadn't known.  Handed down through the ladies of the family, there is a diary and letters detailing Mary's chalice, The Scottish Rose, as well as its hiding place during the Cromwell era.<br /> Duncan Fraser is a widower who has turned into himself after the deaths of his two young sons.  Such fulfillment as his life has now, is as the chief of the coastal rescue mission.  Although in his opinion he  has rescued entirely too many fool-hardy wanderers from the rough North Sea around the Ladysgate, he can't imagine quite why he is so concerned about someone who hasn't even asked for his help.  Instinctively, he senses her plea for help over time and distance, and plunges into the past after her. Together, they, along with the deaf-mute boy, Pauley, contrive to become a part of history without distorting it.<br /> The research required for this marvelous book is simply mind-boggling, not to mention the intriguing way in wh! ich it ispresented.  How many of us, after all, are that w! ell acquainted with any history of three or four hundred years ago?  It is a tribute to the author that no single thread of this complex tapestry is allowed to overshadow any other, yet the result is so vivid and so satisfying that you'll wish you could hang it on your wall.	1998-07-21
US	50289674	RKXLKNADRE9DV	0451186516	740744393	The Faun's Folly (Regency Romance, Signet)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Laugh-out-loud wit combine with a touch of fantasy.	If you love to laugh, this book will give you a boost!  Sylvanus, the faun, is one of the better literary creations of this prolific and wonderfully creative writer.  With only a few well-chosen words, Ms. Heath manages to create mental images that contribute to the general hilarity.  The Faun's Folly does not have the sensuality of many of her more recent books, and indeed, were it not for Sylvanus' frequently misdirected spells, there would be almost none.  However, both romances end well - that of the humans as well as the, er -- other creatures, and even the bad guy somewhat redeems himself.  This is a five-star read, no question.	1998-07-17

If you like to readwell-written mysteries, you'll like this book.  If you like books thatdrop names of famous persons all over the place, you'll like this book.<br />All in all, it's almost totally satisfying, even to this non-golfer, and who doesn't even watch it on TV!  Although I do read about it in the daily paper.  Because what I do like is reading. On almost any topic, as long as the book is well-written, craftily plotted, with some wit and characters I wish I could meet, in person. There are a couple of small and annoying editorial glitches, plus one habitual trick that I almost wish the author would have left out.  Set during the Crosby Pro-Am Golf Tournament at Pebble Beach in January, 1974, the author, AP golf writer John Logue, continually writes &quot; . . . would in future years . . &quot; or &quot; . . . would win this tournament (or some other one.)&quot; It's nice to know what would happen in years to come, but it might have been better had he made it contemporary, and looked back, rather than all that looking into the future.<br />That's a minor niggle, though.  Much can be forgiven for writing of this high quality; there is a serenely poetical walk-through of each of the holes of this famous course, carved as it is out of cliffs and ocean, and exceedingly vulnerable to the whims of Mother Nature.  On its own, this chapter could send you heading for a travel bureau - or an instructor in golf, so you could experience it firsthand.<br />Bing himself plays a minor role, finding himself in the hospital.  His brother Larry, plus entertainers Phil Harris and Clint Eastwood, rub shoulders with all sorts of major golfers of the time (and earlier) - Nicklaus, Weiskopf, Bolt, Strange, Snead, Hogan - who wander through the pages along with the eventual winner of the rain-shortened tourney - Johnny Miller.<br />This is the fourth of a series about golf writer John Morris and his lady, Julia Sullivan. I'd not read any ofthe previous ones, but this one sent me to my library for the first one - FOLLOW THE LEADER, from 1979.	1998-07-17
