It has the kindness and warmth of Seasame Street books, with the wonderful characters places from the Muppets. Who can resist Miss Piggy? If you can find it, I would suggest getting it for your young child, or just reading it to yourself for fun.	2001-10-08

Not only can this be a very amusing and informative coffee table book, but you can sit down and read it like a novel. It goes through history (in a rather disorderly way) and writes about the different fashions of the times...different designers...and how time developed the current clothes we wear today. For the fashion victim or the fashionless...this is an adorable book.	2001-09-20

The first book is such a lovely introduction, and obviously Rowling's baby. The third is just a spectacular novel, it is secure in the knowledge that it is not only a part of a series, but a firm novel all on its own. The fourth book changes the whole world, and will make the 5th, 6th, and 7th books world totally different from the one we were introduced to (but still good). This second book has its own special place as well. It is a marvelous change. It is so different from the first one. Slightly darker, but that makes it all the more exciting. It is a mix of sadness and happiness that Harry Potter is growing up, and can now handle more. He is 12-years-old, and achieving things that we couldn't achieve as 35 year-olds. The books set a wonderful example, and really show good being rewarded for being truly good. The final battle has so many different metaphors, myths and great references that it takes a few readings to fully understand. I have read this book 4 times...and it is still exciting!! I have it on tape and CD and in hardcover. This is a truly magnificent novel on its own, and a great section of a great series.	2001-08-28

I was going through &quot;Fantastic Beasts and where to Find them&quot; last night, and I noticed a creature that was mysteriously like a creature in the Harry Potter books themselves. Similar characteristics were described, as well as looks. Could J.K. Rowling have included clues to the books in these books? I sure hope so! They are adorable little books that will keep the older kids and adults excited about turning the page. The little notes written in it by &quot;Ron&quot;, &quot;Hermione&quot; and &quot;Harry&quot; are amazingly funny (especially if you have a fair knowledge books 1,2,3&amp;4. Quidditch through the Ages is just as wonderful as Harry makes it out to be. If the pictures wold fly around, it would be just as it is in the books. These two books are going to be collectors items either to the public or any Harry Potter fan. I would suggest getting them...they will definitely help you think up some theories about the next three books! All proceedings go to charity...I hope J.K. Rowling comes out with more! I would LOVE a herbology or Potions book!!!	2001-08-28

What makes these \\"childrens\\" books so popular? The really cool plot? Is it the neat covers? The kind and sympathetic protagonist or school which he attends? Everyone has asked this question to themselves...until of course, they read them. This book, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" (Philosophers in Britain) is the book that started it all. I remember distinctly strolling through a bookstore, and seeing a surprisingly colorful book on the New York Times Bestseller list shelf. I picked it up (realizing that it was a childrens book) and read the front cover. I decided that it looked interesting enough and I (was indeed) judging a book by its cover. That night, I turned off the television and sat on my couch wondering what I should do for the next hour. I looked at the mess of books laying in front of me and decided to pick up the one with the lovely cover called \\"Harry Potter\\". I read the first page slowly and then faster, loving every word. It was so carefully written, I could almost feel the energy that Rowling had put into it coming out through each word. As I completed the first chapter, I knew that putting this book down was not an option. The beautiful scenery described was so perfect, that I still wonder is it possible that everyone sees the same thing? Yes. With a few variations, Rowling so masterfully describes the castle, the grounds and Platform 9 3/4 that even those of us with the wildest imagination can't change what it looks like. They feel like real places. The three dimensional characters were overwhelming. Every character has a name, and an obvious past that will slowly be told. Whether it is filled with dark secrets, and mysterious happenings, or just an ordinary life of an average brittish seemingly-muggle child. Each person has emotions, which the reader has to pick up just as they would in real life. You know what Harry feels, but no one else. The situation is described, and it is left to your imagination to say what vibes the person is putting out, or what is going on behind their words. By the time I finished this amazing book, I did not want to say good bye to my friends. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Hagrid...all of those people who had made Harry Potter book 1 so real to me. So I waited until the second book came out, and read that as well. But Harry Potter and the Sorcerers (philosophers) Stone will always have a special place in my heart. The wonderful thing about these books is that they become a part of you. Once you read the first one it stays with you forever, and something will always draw your fingers across the cover just to feel lthe lovely pattern. Ms. Rowling must have attended Hogwarts, her pen is her wand, and her paper is the hat which she pulls this magical world out of.The situation is described, and it is left to your imagination to say what vibes the person is putting out, or what is going on behind their words.

After reading the Harry Potter books, and countless reviews saying that they were no where near Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit series...I thought I would check it out. Tolkien is the master of fantasy, it has been determined, I decided to judge for myself. I had started reading the Hobbit a few times before, and enjoyed it, though I would always put it down for something slightly more riveting, interesting, or something that just came out :::cough Harry Potter book 4:::: and I had to read. When I finally picked it up again, determined to read it before I read the LOTR, and determined to read them before the movie, I was pushed gently at first and then given a sudden yet enthralling shove into the Middle Earth.<br />The adventures of Bilbo Baggins are like no other. They are calm enough to make you feel cozy inside, yet interesting enough to make you keep reading. Tolkien's gift for writing, though celebrated many times, is never as strong as the first time you read the first page of the Hobbit. I lived through each moment, and found myself picking up the book subconciously and just reading it, as though I was thumbing through my life story, as oppose to that of Bilbo.<br />Tolkien created one of the most subtle and real realities I have ever come across. He created a totally believable spiecies of creature (many, actually), a totally believable plot and a wonderfully magical tale that will leave you all warm inside, and wanting more! The perfect push-off point for the Lord of the Rings. Every time the LOTR got slightly boring, or slowed down, I just remembered how calmly I had been able to read the Hobbit, and it kept me from giving up altogether. Definitely a &quot;must-read&quot; to anyone who enjoys good literature, and a great starting point for people who are wary of fantasy.<br />Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go sweep my hobbit-hole now.	2001-08-21

This book seemed to have nothing to do with the life of Bob Hope. Quirk seems to have choosen a star who was connected to many people and then dug up every piece of gossip possible on them. The book has all of the bad things about Hope, the people surrounding Hope and the way Hope lived his life. Nothing is less satisfying than spending your money on a biography and getting a gossip column about stars and producers sexual preferences, which is probably the things most promintently described throughout the whole book. If you want to get the real, true biography about Bob Hope, by the A&amp;E video biography, legions better.	2001-07-22

Cute little beings with fluffy pink skirts and sparkle-covered wands.&quot; Is imediately what comes to mind when you hear the word fairytale. Fortunately, there is a remedy for this generalization, &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; breaks boundaries wherever it dares to tread. A 12-year-old who is smarter than the adults around him, fairies who are armed and more evolved technologically then humans. Colfer doesn't shy away from anything that may take on by surprise or perhaps darken the tone a little. <br />Colfer creates a criminal mastermind who should be in middle school, a group of fairies that are as scary as an FBI, and yet he creates no real bad guy. A complex task to say in the least. By telling the story through many a chapter that could very well begin with &quot;back at the ranch&quot; (though they goodness they don't) you get to see the kindnes in all of the characters. At first, you obviously think Artemis will be our little hero, but then you realize that he is down-right crafty, and mean. Once you meet the fairy Holly, you of course think &quot;Aaah! Here is our fearless good guy!&quot; once again, you realize that the fairies aren't all that kind either.<br />I have noticed that it has been compared to Harry Potter many times, and obviously, when people read this, it is a let down. &quot;There is no mystical joy in this book!&quot; people say, &quot;No clear defined good guy-bad guy relationship!&quot; True. Artemis Fowl is in no way like Harry Potter. A young male protagonist that has something to do with magic of some sort doesn't always have to be a clone of Harry. This book has a darker tone with some dark imagery and language. It can be rather icky at times (nothing older kids can't handle) it is definitely a good read. <br />Artemis Fowl is gripping, exciting and pleasently dark. A must-read for kids ages 12 and up.	2001-07-08

It is hard to have all of the little seemingly unimportant details in place, and noticed at the proper time. It is hard to weave words together in such a way that the reader feels as though he or she is being spoken to directly, yet know that it is beautiful. John Irving has done all of these things in &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot;, and not only that, but he has created one of the most heartbreaking characters in all of literature. Once I got about a chapter into it, I no longer felt that I was reading a book that I had been given as a present. Or that I was reading the original story that 'Simon Birch' was based on. I felt as though I was getting a glimpse into a parallel universe, where I could escape to, by reading anothers problems. Owen Meany is a little boy, who is very short, and has a &quot;permanent scream&quot; for a voice. He believes that he is Gods instrument. Once I stepped into this world, I found it hard to step out. As I read the last sentence, and closed the book, I felt a sense of loss, for no longer being able to read John Wheelwrights (the narrator and basic main character) thoughts, and points of view. No longer able to 'hear' Owen's voice. Each character played a part just as important as the next. From the joys of childhood and playing tricks on adults, to accepting death and the true meaning of God, 'A Prayer for Owen Meany'explores some of the most and least controversial and interesting subjects. A story of a true hero, and how he not only came to be, but how much he changed peoples lives.	2001-06-05

Rowling first tried to publish Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, publishers told her that it was to long for children. Children read the book and loved it! The second (longer) book was just as popular. The third (longer!) was JUST as popular as the preceeding. And then, after a long wait, the fourth book appeared and broke records here and there and was amazingly popular! Not only are the storylines in the Harry Potter series, wonderfully creative and interesting, but they are funny, clever and enticing. They allow children to feel important, and the length themselves prove that Ms. Rowling does not look down upon children. Below average children, average and children who have an IQ of 200 have no way of looking down on this book, because it is spectacular. This book is very different and has started its own genre. Three cheers for Harry Potter.	2001-06-03

I thought this book was a very good over-view of different classic TV theme songs...but there were a few problems with it. As with Javna's other books, it seemed to be thrown together, and not carefully checked: for instance, some of the trivia was incorrect. I think it is a handy book to have around just in case you feel like plunking the &quot;Mr. Ed&quot; theme song out on the piano...but definitely not a theme-song bible.	2001-05-25

It is different from Neil Simons other largely succesful plays, because of it's serious undertones; though it does not lack comedy. It takes place in the 1940's Yonkers, NY. Two boys whos' mother died recently of cancer move in with their grandmother while their father tries to pay off his debt by going around selling scrap iron in the south. The family is genuinely messed up, between simple yet sweet Bella, Henchman Louie, Gert who cannot speak without sucking in half of her sentence, and Eddie (the father of the two boys) who is rather weak; the boys have quite a family. But none of these characters are any bit as overwhelming as Jay and Arty's german grandmother, who was brought up strictly and brought her children up in such a way that there is something wrong with all of them. <br />Yet, this play also has a bright side. The character of Arty has some wonderful oneliners; for instance:<br />&quot;Jay: He had an uncle in Poland who died. He left the money in the will to Pop.<br />Arty: You think the Germans would let some Jew in Poland send nine thousand dollars to some Jew in Alabama?&quot;<br />This line, if properly delivered is funny, yet poigniant. I strongly suggest that you read it; and if you get the chance, see it live. A heart-wrenching coming of age story about the search for independence and how the past can influence your life forever.	2001-05-21

Little Milo ventures into a world of Doldrumms, Words and Numbers with little Rhyme or Reason. Though this book has a few sections that you can tell are the 'MAIN' parts of the story, all of the little, seemingly forgetable parts of the story are the ones that seem to stick with one for the longest amount of time. What parts do I mean? Well, you will just have to find out.	2001-05-21

Many biographies are written for money, the authors job, or many other factors...rarely is it for pure interest in the famous figure at hand. This book is one of those rare and special books that make you WANT to see the work the star has been in, that doesn't lessen your enjoyment of the movies because of what you know about the actor (perhaps that is Ms. Foster's flawless privacy). This book is about one of the true actresses of our time, who is as true to the camera as she is to the interviewer (when answering questions she is willing to discuss). It has not only increased my knowledge of Jodie Foster herself, but reminded me of what she has been through, and how valiantly she  came through them. I loved this book, and I think that most movie buffs or plain fans will as well.	2001-05-19

I have read such wonderful travel books as &quot;One Year Off&quot; and &quot;French Impressions&quot; and I have to say, that this one lives up to all of the critics praise. The concept, is a man travels to Asia, India and Africa in search of a person--who wouldn't otherwise get to go--to invite to the USA for a month. Now, at first, I thought, well that is rather weird. I mean, isn't that also kind of strange to the person? But as I get into it, I realise that he really is looking for a trade. Like he gets to go to their country, and they tell him about the history and are hospitable. Now, he can in turn invite them to his country, (just because he is better off financially) and teach them about the history. It is just a trade between friends, really. I suggest that you read this book. It was very good, with a few funny parts.	2001-05-16

When one mentions 'Dr. Seuss' the cat in the hat, Green Eggs and Ham and of course, the Grinch who Stole Christmas come to mind, yet this has always been considered a classic. Why you are asking, just why is that? Is it because it is good, or bombastic? Why is this book considered a classic? Could it be it's marvelous jokes, or it's enjoyable little mischevious pokes, at the world around. Is it because it is so implausible, in fact applausible, in it's own right? Could it be that it is more fun to read at night? Why isn't it here or there? Why isn't it anywhere? The content of the book at charge, is amazingly hysterical, the enjoyment was large. If I had to choose one book by Seuss, this would be the only one to NOT say, vamous. It is philisophical, optical, practical, and factual. It can be enjoyable for 3-year-old Sally or 30-year-old Sam! After reading such a great book, I personally took a second look, at how lucky I really am.	2001-05-11

I read it a few years ago, I still felt the same way, and I read it this morning, and it was still wonderful. This book does not have to represent male/female roles, it does not have to represent how people should act, it does NOT have to represent how to share, why can't it just be what it is? A sweet book which children will enjoy. Yes, this book belongs in the childrens section, not only because of the connection I feel to the book personally, but because of the connection to the book that millions of people (most of whom probably are not ...) have to this book of their childhood.	2001-05-11

When a piece of literature, brings back all of those feelings and memories, it is something to remember. Pictures, stories, Archie-isms and an episode guide are just a few things that make up this book. I recommend it to all Archie Bunker fans and haters alike.

I own every FBOFW collection in published exsistence, and this is probably one of my favorites. Though it lacks in drawings compared to the other ones, I have always loved commentary. I found that it gave me a totally new persective when reading the added strips to each characters chapter. For instance, they showed what Connie was intended to be, and how she ended up being, two totally different characters! It went deeper into the persona of each character, as if they were real. Now, some people are cynical of this, thinking that people go overboard. I disagree. This book helps the stories come alive for readers, it helps them connect with the characters and enchance their reading experience. Though it is at times a bit schmultzy, this book is overall a must-have for FBOFW readers everywhere.	2001-05-06

'Can these three really pull this off?', 'Will the acting do well?', and 'Uh-oh, I think these scripts are going to be awful!' were just a few of the thoughts that ran through my head. The next time it was on, I forced myself to watch it, thinking 'if I hate it this time, I never have to watch it again', it made me laugh, so I tuned in once more. And, I haven't been able to stop yet. Three's Company has the appeal and humor of it's modern counterpart 'Friends' with a touch of the 70's. <br />I watched Three's Company religiously, so when I came across this book, I was to say the least, quite excited. I bought it immediately, and read it in one day. The book throws you deeper into this fictional world of Jack, Janet and Chrissy, which might somewhere, be not that far from reality. It documented the fight between Suzanne Somers and the producers so thoroughly, I felt as though I was there. It interviewed the actors and producers so honestly, I knew that it had really hurt them. It is almost impossible to be inside someones head, especially a celebrities, Chris Mann has taken that experience and put it on paper, making this one of the most (if not THE most) superb TV book I have come across.	2001-05-06

The meaningful jokes (by meaningful I mean that they are almost subliminally coaxing kids to do homework) are miracles. This writing style should be used more often! If the author comes out with other informative, witty and adorable books, I will be the first customer!	2001-05-06

Though my local paper does not get this strip, even I can tell that it has recently blossomed. In its earlier stages it seemed cutsie and corny, now that Pasquale is talking, and Rose's alter-egos are in full gear, we are full experiencing the world of this adorable family. Roses frequent meetings with her ladybig, Pasquales guardian angels slip ups and Jimbo's constant teasing (Pasquale! Did you remember to pay the moon bill?&quot;) have kept me laughing and sympathizing. A strip to go down in history.	2001-05-06

Our smart protagonists, are starting to catch on very slowly to Count Olaf's schemes. Perhaps their continuous disapointments have started to affect them? From the moment the _____ (I will not reveal the title) was introduced, I knew where the Quagmires were, it was very simple logic, which the Bauldelaires didn't seem to notice. I recommend these books along with the rest in the series, but I hope that the next book will be as good as 5 and 6, which kept me on the edge of my seat. Snicket has done it again...except a bit more predictably.	2001-05-02

I, not knowing about the excessive amounts of hype on this book, unknowingly bought it, thinking it looked interesting. Little did I know the world I was about to be plunged into. Though compared to Harry Potter, few similarities are found, I can see why people would consider them alike. They both deal with preteen male (bright) protagonists, who beat the odds, and take on large amounts of responsibility and power. Not to mention the magic. If it weren't for the title, this book would not really have a recognizable &quot;good guy&quot; or &quot;bad guy&quot; considering both parties were armed, dangerous and fatal. This was a better aspect of the book, because you did not find yourself saying &quot;NO! Stop! I want YOU to win!&quot;, I realized that I was objective yet, involved. Colfer has an undeniable talent for weaving words into beautiful, yet horrifying (at times) sentences. I suggest this book to older &quot;Potterheads&quot; (it can be a bit scary for the younger folk), and Harry Potter rebels alike.	2001-05-01

The amazing thing about this book, is that it was written so long ago, yet it predicted many technological things that have happened recently. What makes it ironic is, is that the plot is basically about book burning, and banning and the absurdity of it all. YET it is a banned book itself. Could it have predicted this? Maybe. But, basically, this book has a great story and plot, on whatever level you read it.	2001-04-27

The Hooterville Handbook gives the reader unknown knowledge about the creation, and development of one of the kookiest sitcoms, &quot;Green Acres&quot;. It supplies various essays regarding the impact of and interesting things about Hootervile (also Green Acres) and all of its locals. What was so special about Arnold the pig? WAS that salesman married or not? Such pressing questions are masterfully answered by Mr. Cox. Only one glitch, that seems to occur in most of Cox's Classic TV books; he doesn't seem to enjoy writing, watching, or doing anything involving his profession. He writes with a cold air of superiority, which could come across as professional, or rudely distant. Overall, however, this book was fascinating, a good read, and had the insights of the cast, crew, and random essay writers.	2001-04-27

Steve Cox, I must say, wrote a good book, with intriguing facts, interesting essays and funny side-notes that make you think. I thought it interesting that he paid so much respect to BEWITCHED, not a bad thing at all, but very sportsman like. The book is a mix between an editorial and a fact book, which I think was a neat concept. Over all well written with unknown facts, such as why Larry Hagman didn't show up in the reunion movie in 1985 (He wasn't notified of it until he was called for a costume fitting.) <br />I suggest it for all &quot;Jeannie&quot; fans and classic TV buffs alike.	2001-04-22

I thought this book was one of the most thorough, and well written books of its kind. My only complaint is this: the author showed a fairly negative view on all other shows of the time. Such as &quot;Three's Company&quot; which he labeled as a show with no point except to see the female stars wear diving necklines, which I think is wrong. Other then different opinions then my own, I think this book was great on facts, trivia and wonderful bios of each actor. A must for everyones classic TV library	2001-04-22

Levine's previous two novels have been enjoyable, but not as gripping as Ella, or this one. It is an intricately woven tale of magic, courage and adventures. The classic tale of the weak finding courage, but with a new insentive and a wonderful adventure ahead of her. This humorous, witty tale brought as much enjoyment to me, as Ella Enchanted. 'Dave in the Night&quot; and &quot;The Wish&quot; were very good, but Ella and &quot;The Two Princesses of Bamarre&quot; are by far, Levine's two masterpieces.

As always, Carson Levine wove a tale, that not only involved magic and wonder, but also peer pressure and things that normal kids deal with. The story was seamlessly told, with a flare for magic unlike other books. I don't suggest it for people under 10 at the youngest. I think that it is best for 11-year-olds and over. It has some teenage content, which makes it even ore believeable. &quot;The Wish&quot; was an enjoyable adventure into the mind of a middle-schooler, something very people even venture to try, let alone, create.	2001-04-06

The Miserable Mill was a marvelous book, but it was probably my least favorite of the series. If I can give 5 stars to in my opinion the worst one...IMAGINE what the others must be like! They are wonderful books, and horrifyingly enjoyable! These books remind me of Roald Dahls books, but Lemony Snicket's books have a style of their own. I am counting the days until the next (7th) book comes out.	2001-04-01

These are very Roald Dahlesk books, so if you like Roald Dahl, you will probably like this. Such funny happenings as a baby being forced to be a seceratary, and make her own staples, and nightly 6-hour long violin concerts by a headmaster who can't play the violin worth a hoot. I thought that this book put a nice change in the series that was beginning to be JUST A TAD repetitive. Now that their are new inscentives of Count Olaf and the Bauldeires, the books have a new level of excitment. This book especially kept me reading, I read the whole thing in one sitting. I strongly suggest you read these books in order, but don't stop at the 3rd or 4th one, keep reading and you will get to the really exciting ones.	2001-04-01

Now, I have read Jane Yolen stories before, and they are usually good...so this one suprised me. It seemed as if Yolen was given an estimate of how many pages she was allowed to use, when her basic plot for herself took about 150 pages. The story seemed empty, but with much potential. I just don't see how this book is put in so many 'If you like Potter' sections of book stores. It just wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I also found it darker then it had to be. If this book was longer, it would have been much better, and probably more popular.	2001-03-30

It was not&quot;David Copperfield,&quot;  but was anyone really expecting Charles Dickens? This story had believable characters, an interesting plot and good (if not predictable) turns of events. Ibbotson is on a roll of good books, and they are her first! So, congratulations Ms. Ibbotson for the marvelous stories.	2001-03-30

In this book two psychologists took brilliant children, and helped them realize that they weren't all so very different from one another. Each child was bruised in someway, in every way from feeling different from the rest of the world so intensley that they can barely stand it, to being physically abused. Ms. Tolan did the (expected) wonderful job I was hoping for with this book. From the ending, I believe that a sequel may be published in awhile, but I am not sure. You will be astounded by the outcome, and how much you connect to these amazing characters.	2001-03-28
