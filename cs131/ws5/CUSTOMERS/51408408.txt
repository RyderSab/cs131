The words she uses paints a facinating picture of not only Richmond, but of life during those times.  This story of Caroline grips you from the first page, and never disappoints.  Thanks for a wonderfully written story.  I can't wait for book two in the series!	2003-06-27

There you will meet Dave Richman, the FBI Hero of this book.  You don't have to read DANGER before reading NEGOTIATOR, but you will want to read both of them, and all the following Henderson books.  In NEGOTIATOR, Kate O'Malley is a negotiator, a very good one.  In her world she struggles with how justice and mercy can co-exist.  Dave Richman is an FBI agent who believes that God is merciful and just, and struggles with helping Kate understand.  Throw in a major blow-up, a plot that keeps you guessing, plus a friends/family unit of support that is incredibally realistic, and you have a book you won't want to put down.  You will also want to attend the next O'Malley family gathering!  I am so glad that Ms. Henderson invites us to join the family in several other books.  Don't miss them!	2002-02-11

I love the way Dee Henderson has created such a diverse and rich family unit with the O'Malleys. A noted forensic pathologist to her peers, Lisa is the one the family sees as always getting herself into trouble.  The trouble this time is very real, and in the end helps her come to some life changing decisions.  Dee has a wonderful way with words, and I especially like the way she has artfully told a few scenes in this book in retrospect.  Just read it and you will see what I mean!<BR>Another plus about this series is that you can start with this story and it won't mess you up to go back and read the others. While the family steps in and out of each others lives, their devotion to each other is a constant theme.  One book about the O'Malley's and you will definately want to meet the rest of them!	2002-02-05

The continuning tale of Grace, Peter, Karen and their families, is really a story of forgiveness, acceptance, contentment and learning to trust.  Ms. Peterson does a great job of creating &quot;real&quot; characters, and the descriptions of the Alaska Gold Rush seemed real to me as well.  I have always liked the way she weaves faith throughout her stories with out being &quot;preachy&quot;.  A must read if you have read the first two in the series, and all three a must if you haven't yet started!	2002-02-05

With an ongoing series, there usually comes a book that is good, but not as good as the rest.  Not so with Dee Henderson's O'MALLEY series.  Each book brings us a different &quot;family&quot; member, yet each can stand alone with it's characters and story -and they all are great reads!  Jack, the firefighter brother, is the central character of THE PROTECTOR. As in each of the O'Malley books, there is a mystery to solve (I was surprised at whodoneit!) as well as self discovery for the characters.  Ms. Henderson writes characters that you can believe exist, that you can identify with as they struggle, and rejoice with as they find answers.   <br />I really enjoyed meeting not only Jack and his friends in this book, but also Rachel, the subject of the next O'Malley book.  Plus, we got up to date on the other family memebers...if you haven't read any thing from Dee Henderson - start now.  If you have keep at it!  THE PROCTECTOR won't let you down!	2001-10-26

Once again, Lawanna Blackwell transports you back to times past.  Her characters become real - you can feel their joy, their pain, their struggles, their victories.  The Maiden of Mayfair brings us a new family with all of the above.  It is a wonderfully written tale of learning how to forgive, and how our selfish actions can affect the lives of others.  Ms. Blackwell does an excellent job of teaching her characters about God's love and forgiveness by using their true to life circumstances.  All of her books are believable, readable, and hard to put down! This one is no exception.	2001-02-12

Once again you are back in Pine Mountain for the third book in the series, and once again you will be delighted at the happenings in this small tourist town.  Melody Carlson blends forgiveness and misunderstanding into  a delightful tale that involves all the characters from the other two, as  well as some new ones (villans of course!).  You will struggle for truth  with the Pine Cone news crew, want to ground Leah for her mostly  unintentional actions, find yourself praying for snow and cheer for Maggie  and Jed as they discover what peace God has for them.  A must series for  anyone who has ever lived in a small town, as well as those who want to  know what it would be like to live in one!	2000-07-19

She accomplishes this by putting you right into the lives of  each of these women through a series of &quot;flashbacks&quot; throughout  the story.  At first this bothered me (I'm not a &quot;dream sequence  fan!&quot;) but as the book progressed I realized that it was the best way  to tell each story.  When you experience the hurt with them, you can also  experience the joy and peace that forgiveness brings.<br />For people  interested in history of the Holy Lands, this covers the Roman invasions to  present day conflicts.  The descriptions of the wars and the prejudice are  accurate give insight that we don't get from the news.  I learned a lot,  after I stopped skimming those parts!  They are important to help you know  the characters - and how forgivess was hard for them and those they  love.<br />An excellent choice for you who love historial fiction, as well as  you romance-only readers.  This books shows that everyone needs to be  forgiven - and sometimes forgiving ourselves is hardest of all.  A second  wonderful book by Lynn Austin.	2000-07-15

The second book in The Reardon Brothers Series introduces you to Noah, a lawyer who has sworn off women.  Then along comes Jessica and what can he do but save her from her father and take her back to her unknowing family  in Baltimore.  <br />Dianna Crawford does a great job of showing you the  differences between frontier life and &quot;high society&quot; in the late  1700's through Jessica's eyes.  You will love Noah's honor and his quest to  bring Jessica happiness, and cheer when Jessica realizes where her heart  truely lies.  You will also look at salt with new appreciation!<br />I have  enjoyed many of this author's books and this is a wonderful follow up to  the first in the series, Freedom's Promise.	2000-07-04

There is an old saying about saying nice things in case you have to eat your words....and Dr. Ethan Gray learns that lesson when an injury requires him to use the services of Olivia Plummer.  Olivia had been the town's  &quot;healer&quot; until the uppity bonna fide Dr. Gray had come to town.   <br />Pushed together by circumstances (and by order of the town Sheriff!) the  two find a way to work together, and eventually to respect each others  abilities.  As time passes, Ethan regrets his earlier actions, but Olivia  is determined to make her point.  Both learn the hard way that choosing  God's will over our own is a much better path.<br />A quick, easy read, and  one that will warm your heart.  I look forward to the next in the Abounding  Love series.  (why can't I ever discover a series AFTER they are all  written! )	2000-07-04

The first two were great, and the third one good, but the following books have not met that standard.<br />Ransom of Love is a good title for the story line of this  book.  They do a wonderful job of showing two different illustrations of  how Christ has paid our ransom.  The information on slavery was interesting  and the hate and bigotry toward the slaves is unfortunately true.  However,  I found the book itself redundantly wordy and at times too simply written.   <br />I only recommend this book if you have read the others in the series.   For those who haven't  - read the others first so you can see the quality  of work the Lacy's are better know for.	2000-07-02

Once again, Tracie Peterson has woven a wonderful story that captures your attention and makes you examine your own heart.  A Slender Thread is the story of five sisters and their wise grandmother who raised them.  The  story weaves you though each of their lives, showing how families can be so  close, yet so far apart.  You are able to identify with each sister and her  personal struggles, as well as how this causes problems within the family.   You will laugh and cry with Maggie and cheer her decisions on how to prove  a much needed point to her granddaughters.  I couldn't put it down.  A must  read for anyone with siblings - especially sisters - and even more so if  you don't always get along!	2000-06-10

Lisa Tawn Bergren has done an excellent job of wrapping up all the lives we learned to love (and some we didn't!) in the first two of this trilogy. CAPTIAN'S BRIDE and DEEP HARBOR kept you on the edge of your chair and at  times exclaiming - &quot;she can't do that to that character!&quot;.  In  MIDNIGHT SUN, you can relax a little more while reading, but for me it was  still a &quot;stay up and read until it's finished&quot; wonderful,  satisfying ending.  The author may state this is the end to this series,  but I wonder if she would consider another book with the children all grown  up?  Does Alaska have to be the final frontier for these wonderful  characters? Read all three books, you will laugh and cry with the rest of  us!	2000-03-16

It amazes me how Tracie Peterson can take an old story line (twins switching places) put them in an already used setting (Harvey House girls) and create a brand new, wonder what will happen next story!  I have enjoyed  all of Ms. Peterson's books and this one is no exception.  This series is  excellent.  So often writers of series tend to tell too much of the same  stuff in each book or make you wonder what the story has to do with the  series at all.  All of Tracie's stories are fresh, interesting and will  keep you up reading until you finish, then make you wish for the next one  right away.  Keep up the good work!	2000-02-23

She even solves a mystery from Secrets,  Book One of the Glennbrooke series!  If you liked the other six, you will  love Woodlands and long for another trip to Glennbrooke.
