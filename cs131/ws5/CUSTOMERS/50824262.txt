For some, speaking before a large group - or even attending a small business meeting - is an overwhelming experience. Do your palms start to sweat, just thinking about it?  Whether it's a job interview or a cocktail party - YOU are on-stage and in the spotlight.<br /><br />At some point in our lives and careers, each one of us experiences tough situations or awkward moments. Times when we are nervous and wish we could communicate better.  Who hasn't wondered: Do I talk too fast? Too slowly? Is my voice too nasal? During a meeting, do you ever think: How do I excuse myself to go to the restroom? Why does someone else always say what I was going to say? What if someone asks me a question I can't answer?  What if I forget someone's name? What if I dribble salad dressing on my shirt in front of clients? Why do people always interrupt me? Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me? Am I a good listener? The office manager told me to call, but now she doesn't remember who I am! People think I'm standoffish, but I'm really shy.<br /><br />Regardless of your profession, background, or level of experience, \\"Smart Speaking\\" provides an abundance of \\"60-Second Strategies\\" that will help you become more confident and a more effective communicator.

We learn by example and the profiles in this book have much to teach us. Among the significant examples is Penny Harrington, the first woman in America to lead a major metropolitan police department. As said by police historian Dorthy Moses Schulz, \\"Penny Harrington is one of only a handful of people who can claim to have changed American policing forever....\\" The lessons learned by Penny - and the important lessons she shares with others - can be read in her highly intimate autobiography, \\"Triump of Spirit,\\" which was published in 1999. Penny is not only a criminal justice pioneer, she is a shining example of a woman who beat the odds and paved the way for all women who strive for a career in law enforcement. (The reviewer is the author of \\"Top Cops: Profiles of Women in Command,\\" which also profiled Penny and 12 other brave women who broke through the brass ceiling of policing.)	2005-07-03

Perhaps President Clinton tackled too much in trying to write this book as a single volume. Clinton might have been better advised by his editor and publisher to write a multi-volume set that would enable him to be introspective about his personal demons and experiences, while also contributing his valuable intellectual assessment to other aspects of his Presidency. I would have preferred to read one volume on Clinton's approach to domestic issues - his initial goals, why some succeeded and others failed; and another on his perspectives of foreign policy initiatives. The responsibility for this disappointing book falls not on President Clinton alone -  who obviously tried to speak from his heart. Clinton is not, after all, a skilled author, editor or publisher. Rather, the major responsibility for this very disappointing book sits squarely on the shoulders of Clinton's editors and publisher - who were not concerned with President Clinton's legacy, but were more interested in rushing into the bookstores and getting their ten million-plus worth. Shame on them. They did both President Clinton and the public a great disservice. We still have much to learn from President Clinton. I hope his next book fulfills that promise.

This is an important book for women - regardless of their professional goals. Anna Fels makes an important point about women who downplay their courageousness for fear of being unfeminine. Women show far too much humility about their accomplishments. If we want people to value our skills and to listen to what we have to say, we must first show that we value ourselves - by making sure our accomplishments are visible to targeted audiences. The first step in this process is to have a clear understanding of who you are, what you have accomplished (or want to accomplish), and what strengths as well as weaknesses you possess. Keep in mind that you only have one chance to make a first impression. With a clear view of oneself, and regardless of your life goals, gaining visibility is a key strategy for success.  If we want people to recognize our accomplishments - and then to hire us, buy from us, or invest in our companies, they have to know who we are, what we have accomplished and why they should do business with us!

This is an important book for women who choose to work from home or who decide to start a home-based business. A big, big minus to working from home is the sense of isolation and lack of daily networking opportunities. It is critically important to maintain visibility, and that takes a concerted effort! Publicity must be part of the strategy for success - and it especially important for home-based businesses. I'm not talking about advertising; I'm talking about community visibility - personal publicity that lets potential customers and clients know who you are, what you do, and why they should buy from you or work with you. The women in this book are a good example of how even a small amount of the right publicity can produce a big, big payoff. Certainly all home-based operations will not hit the one million mark.

He wants readers (especially Catholics) to know the transgressions of the church, so the situation may be addressed head-on - and so that important questions will be asked: (1) Are individuals who observe religious dogma prone to be more or less moral? (2) Does practicing the religious observances on one's faith  have any impact at all on morality? (3) Is it the repressive attitude of some religious organizations (ie, the Catholic church) that contributes to the \\"sins of the fathers\\"(ie, pedophilia).

It was as much a documentary on how the news media handles such events, as on the tools and techniques of today's law enforcement communities. In 1999, in &quot;Triumph of Spirit: An Autobiography by Chief Penny E. Harrington,&quot; Chief Moose wrote in the foreword: &quot;As we approach the twenty-first century, Americans are still seeking a way to develop a working relationship with the police in their communities. Americans clearly benefit from a police agency that reflects the community - a police agency that looks, feels, and thinks the way it does - a police agency designed to reflect the community in regard to demographics, ethics, and values.&quot; Many police agencies around the country have adopted effective community policing programs - and those communities have greatly benefited from that effort. The Portland, Oregon episodes described briefly by Moose in &quot;Three Weeks in October&quot; are discussed in great detail in Harrington's book.  I would encourage readers with an interest in learning more about law enforcement diversity, and the often-delicate relationship between communities, their police agencies-and the media, to read her book. It sheds much light on many of the topics touched upon by Chief Moose and provides great perspective about the issues of law enforcement, diversity, the media - and the often-ensuing conflict between the three.

But following a careful step-by-step process will help even the most timid become comfortable with the concept of self-promotion. (from Marion E.

Businessmen and politicians learned long ago that getting the money and publicity go hand-in-hand. Not just any publicity, but solid personal publicity. If we want people to value our abilities, we must first show that we value ourselves - by making sure our accomplishments are visible to targeted audiences. If we want people to invest in our companies, to buy from us, or to hire and promote us into the corner office, they have to know who we are, what we have accomplished and why they should do business with us!

Today's reality certainly does require a strong dose of self-assessment. And the sad truth is that women especially find it harder to land a job after being &quot;downsized.&quot; Sadly, women also show far too much humility about their talents and skills. If you want people to value your skills, you must first show that you value yourself -- by making sure your accomplishments are visible to targeted audiences beyond a resume and job-seeking letter. Potential employers have to know who you are, what you have accomplished and why they should put you on their team! That often takes visibility outside the traditional marketplace and into the social contract of targeted community activities. Then your activities need to be promoted loudly to the right audience. This is particularly important if you take the route of self-employment. Self-promotion isn't bragging. It is a valuable business tool that career women must add to their strategies for success, whether you are looking for a new job, or setting up your own business. (from Marion E.

Books	4	5	5	N	N	Exploring new pathways to understanding the human spirit...	`Spirituality,&quot; &quot;Destiny,&quot; &quot;Karma,&quot; &quot;Searching for truth, meaning and knowledge,&quot;  &quot;Path to success.&quot; These are buzzwords and phrases one can find on an abundance of book jackets and in hundreds of sermons and articles. But to Rachel Madorsky they are far more  - they are a way of life. They are part of a concept that guided her to explore her own life and the lives of others.  They guided her through an often-difficult path to find a way to use her knowledge to help others. And they guided her to write a book that she hopes will enrich the lives of all that read it - even if they do not agree with all of its concepts.<br />I am one of the latter.  As a fervent believer in the scientific basis of medical science, I worry that in the search for total well being some may sidestep the known to explore the unknown - and in doing so will not take full advantage of all that traditional medicine offers. At the same time, I also know there are many questions science alone cannot answer. We live in a Universe that our generation has only just begun to explore. Exploration, and the ability to keep an open mind, are key strengths of &quot;Create Your Own Destiny!&quot;<br />Indeed, there are valid scientific studies that show a relationship between the immune system and a person's attitude. How often have we said to a friend in pain, &quot;I'll think good thoughts for you,&quot; or advised them to &quot;think positive.&quot;<br />Some common skin disorders are known to be exacerbated by anxiety - eczema and psoriasis among them. Depression has been linked to a variety of physical ailments. Psychosomatic medicine is a recognized and growing specialty.<br />Meditation, biofeedback, alternative medicine. These no longer are merely the domain of individuals considered to be outside the traditional community of medicine; they are valid areas of scientific study. The power of prayer is being studied in universities that years ago would have scoffed at that concept.<br />Without denying the experiences reported by Rachel and others, I do not personally believe that charms and incantations, or wishing will keep disease or death from our doorstep. All else being equal, I do not accept that the difference between one person living and another dying rests with how many people pray, or the intensity of religious observance.<br />But I also cannot answer why a smile from a child can make a headache go away. Or why laughter among friends soothes an aching back. Why the memory of a loved one's voice brings courage and strength in the face of danger or great strife, or comfort on a difficult day.<br />Rachel says, &quot;We are responsible for the transmission to our children and grandchildren of our experience and our ability to love all the things on earth...Human experience and wisdom are accumulated through years and generations.&quot;<br />I believe that to not explore our spirituality - to deny outright that we have some connection to the past, present and future through the bonds of family and friendships - would be to deny that life itself exists. Moreover, to deny that our own actions and mind-sets are critical to our success would be akin to never taking responsibility for our own lives.<br />&quot;Create Your Own Destiny&quot; stimulates thought by raising the possibilities of the unknown. It did that for me. Rachel puts forth her experiences for all to see. She presents ideas and concepts that will enrich some readers, and raise doubt in others.<br />Above all, &quot;Create Your Own Destiny&quot; portrays Rachel Madorsky's own path to discovery - a path from which we can all glean something of value. Rachel had the courage to search for her own truth and then to share it with others.  Just imagine what we might learn if we all had that courage?<br />Reviewed by Marion E.

I may not reach them but I can look up and see their beauty, believe in them and try to follow them.&quot;  When Louisa May Alcott wrote these words, she likely had no idea that one day women would not only look beyond the sunshine, but travel beyond the stars to brave new frontiers in outer space.<br />Thanks to the brave and trailblazing women of the Mercury 13, today there are dozens of women throughout America's space program who are changing history: Administrators and managers; engineers, technologists, and astrobiologists; astronauts who are mission specialists, pilots and commanders; astronomers and astrophysicists, biologists, chemists, computer scientists, system specialists and programmers; aeronautics, aerospace, biological, chemical and biomedical engineers; educators who reach out to the public; computer and design engineers; environmental specialists and geologists; pharmacologists and psychologists.... The list goes on and on.<br />In her book, &quot;Composing a Life,&quot; Mary Catherine Bates aptly equates life with a work in progress, an improvisatory art in which each individual learns to combine familiar and unfamiliar components in response to new situations. This is true for men and women in all walks of life, but it is especially relevant for women in aeronautics. For not only are they taking their well-deserved places next to the brave men who fly combat missions and pilot space shuttles -they are also redefining the roles of women in a society that still struggles with gender equality in all professions.<br />Kudos to Martha Ackmann and Lynn Sherr  for telling the story of the Mercury 13!	2003-06-22

This book is a good &quot;marketing&quot; example of how to sell your services by writing a book, and help others in the process - I applaud the authors' efforts. But many of the other suggestions do take dollars that many entrepreneurs and consultants simply don't have. That's where the critical concept of REAL personal publicity takes over. People have to know who you are, what you stand for, and why they should hire you and do business with you. Establishing trust is key - and there are effective ways to do that without spending big bucks or hiring a consultant. Volunteering in the community is one example.Volunteering for a cause you believe in provides professional visibility, as well as the personal and important satisfaction of giving something back to society. Likewise, volunteering for a trade organization can give you lots of valuable professional exposure and recognition among peers and business contacts. Moreover, sending out press releases and getting more than just a little publicity about your efforts does not diminish your good deeds. And that applies to all entrepreneurial endeavors, not just financial planning.	2002-08-28

Estrich makes some very good points in this book, but leaves one critical factor out. Women who do make it to the top not only don't mentor other women - they forget to put a little \\"personal publicity\\" into their career plans! It's always the \\"first woman\\" here, and the \\"first woman\\" there. Being first only lasts as long as making the \\"first mistake\\" which also hits the business page headlines. Achieving corporate and community visibility needs a consistent and planned effort. To really take charge of your career, whether you are still climbing the so-called ladder, or have reached the top rungs - there is no substitute for creating a strategic 'personal' publicity plan. Your boss won't do it, and neither will your mentor (if you have one!). It is up to YOU.

When Gino Gallo put on her uniform, she not only joined a brave group of officers protecting our citizens, she became a part of women's history and a role model.  To pursue a career in policing, women face a strongly gendered organization, where stereotypes of women in uniform persist.  Of the more than 700,00 sworn law enforcment officers serving in the United States, only about 14% are women - and far less are in command positions. Gino Gallo wore a badge of honor. She deserves our thanks, our respect, and an honored place in the history of law enforcement.	2001-04-02

I know of only one other book that is as poignant in its use of a modern and youthful character who is haunted by memories of the Holocaust. Like Hannah in &quot;The Devil's Arithmetic,&quot; Zev Segal did not personally experience the horrors of the Holocaust - but his nightmares teach him an important lesson of why we must never forget.

If we want people to value our skills, we must first show that we value ourselves - by making sure our accomplishments are visible to targeted audiences. If we want people to hire us, buy from us, and invest in our companies, they have to know who we are, what we have accomplished and why they should do business with us!

But it is critical in today's economy, and not just for companies with big budgets. Freelancer writers and other self-employed folks also have opportunities for increased visibility by lending their skills to local charities, or local chapters of national charities. I first reviewed this book in 2001, but I recently re-read it in light of today's economy, with more and more talented people looking for ways to increase their visibility and help others at the same time. Sue Adkins book is more important today than ever!<br /><br />One of the key points made by the author is the importance of the word \\"principles.\\" Before moving forward, there must be an understanding that any partnership between you and a charity must be based on integrity, transparency, sincerity, mutual respect, partnership and mutual benefit. According to Adkins, \\"If not, adjust it, change it or stop it!\\"<br /><br />Adkins provides plenty of examples, case studies that are excellent learning models, including instances of good works gone bad -- due to bad planning and poor communications.<br /><br />For self-employed small business owners and freelancer writers, I found the chapters in Part Four of the book to be the most valuable -- and worth the hefty cost of the book. For example, in \\"Planning and preparation,\\" Adkins emphasizes that for Cause Related Marketing to be effective, it must be built into the overall business strategy. Adkins provides a detailed \\"Process for selection,\\" including such basic elements as how to find a potential partner. In the section on \\"Negotiating the partnership,\\" it becomes clear that negotiation is as important to the freelancer writer who is volunteering to write one press release or organize one event, as it is to a larger company making a big-dollar investment. Tips are provided for defining the nature of the activity, evaluating how much the project is worth to your business, and risk assessment.<br /><br />\\"Communication\\" is a core theme of this book, and for good reason. Communication between you and the Charity, and communication between you, the Charity and the public have legal as well as social ramifications. Communications determines the overall success of the program and the protection of your time investment.<br /><br />Cause Related Marketing is a great reference book on this very timely subject.
