Much of it is reassuring to parents who choose the family bed since he covers the value of the practice and the benefits. But when it comes to encouraging a family-bed baby to sleep through the night his advice sounds like a family-bed Ferber approach. First he says to wait until your baby is at least 12 months old to do anything to make the baby sleep better. (Parents of younger babies won't want to hear this) and then he has a Ten Nights approach to cutting out night waking. He says to choose 7 hours (suggesting 11:00 pm to 6:00 am) and during those hours you don't breastfeed the baby, instead \\"rub, pat and cuddle a little until he falls asleep.\\" This is wishful thinking, as any baby who has been breastfed all night will never accept this without crying. Dr Gordon acknowledges this by saying \\"These will be hard nights.\\" But that \\"If your baby learns that crying, squirming, and fussing (euphemisms, let's just say \\"crying\\") will get him fed, you will set yourself back quite a bit.\\" He also says that this usually takes ten nights and can take longer.

He suggests swatting an 8-month-old who throws food off the high chair. He says by 19 months old swatting should be replaced with spanking with a flexible tool that will sting.<br />He suggests feeding newborns and all babies on a rigid feeding schedule, and letting them cry themselves to sleep right when you bring them home from the hospital to &quot;train&quot; them. (If your goal is to help your baby sleep better, and you'd like to do it in a kind and loving way look to a different book, such as The No-Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help Your Baby Sleep.)<br />The program presented in this book is being investigated by the American Academy of Pediatrics because babies are failing to thrive because of this feeding program. <br />In a chat group of readers of this book, one parent complained that her 2-year-old remained disobedient despite \\"the constant stream of welts on her bottom from the glue stick.\\" A father fretted that his 13-month old \\"will go back and forth from isolation to the high chair for up to four hours and still refuse to give the sign for \\"all done\\" - and Ezzo hand-signal method.<br />The board of elders from the church Ezzo left in California, (Grace Community in Simi Valley) where he started his program, has since issued a public statement accusing him of confusing \\"biblical standards and personal preference.\\" Many doctors, and professionals are very concerned about his influence. His book is published under two titles, Babywise and Growing Kids Gods Way - the title and the book disturb even James Dobson who believes Ezzos program is &quot;extreme and dangerous&quot;. The problem - Many parents follow his advice believing that they are doing the right thing for their babies.<br />It is a shame that a person with the power of influence that Mr. Ezzo has would choose to direct people is such a negative and dangerous way.<br />The methods in this book are dangerous and cruel to babies and play on a new parent's innocence and inexperience. There is no valid research behind it, it is merely one man's opinion. Be smart, do your research before you read this or follow this advice.	2002-07-14

The author contradicts herself throughout. As an example on the same page it says: \\"The sound of your baby's crying is nature's way of making sure that babies are taken care of.\\" Then two sentences later she says, \\"One way to decrease your response is to block out the noise.\\" \\"Turn on anything that will block out the sound\\" She gives examples like a fan, air vent or vacuum cleaner or to go take a shower or blow-dry your hair. Even go get the mail from the mailbox! The author says that if your baby cries so hard she throws up you don't have to feel guilty about it because, and I quote exactly, \\"vomiting can even be fun.\\" If your baby crawls out of the crib? Get a crib tent. If your toddler comes out of the bedroom? Lock the door. Teething? Sure, it hurts, but don't change the rules. Live in an apartment? Warn your neighbors about the crying. Feeling stressed? Put a note on the baby's bedroom door, \\"Crying Baby - Enter at Your Own Risk.\\"  And a note for visitors that says, \\"We are teaching the baby to sleep. Expect dirty dishes, crying babies, and unhappy parents.\\"  I am appalled by this lack of compassion towards babies and parents throughout the entire book. Luckily I bought several sleep books (tired and desperate!) and found one with compassionate, effective solutions that are working for us: The No-Cry Sleep Solution - a totally different viewpoint, the author doesn't advocate crying, let alone vomiting, and we are actually getting more sleep - finally.	2002-06-29

The exact scheduling of so many minutes of crying or so many ounces of milk assumes that all babies are alike, and they aren't. My baby cried so hard he threw up, and the book says to clean him up \\"matter-of-factly and then leave again\\", and not to \\"reward him for throwing up\\" (exact words!) I'm sorry, but my baby was terribly upset and needed some reassurance. Yes, I bet the \\"program\\" works, but at what cost to my child's self esteem and to my relationship with my child? I found more compassionate answers in a book called The No-Cry Sleep Solution written by a mother of four who dealt with sleep issues with her own baby and clearly understands that human beings require more than a quick-fix solution.	2002-06-22

When it is open-ended, the child learns to stop protesting and to fall asleep.\\" Well, sure. Have you ever cried yourself to sleep? Exhaustion and agony work. This requires a hard heart and lots of crying. He also says \\"We are leaving him alone to forget the expectation to be picked up.\\" We are talking about a BABY here, a baby who deserves and needs to picked up and should expect to be picked up. I'm sorry that I started with this book, I'm glad I moved on to one that is more compassionate and loving: The No-Cry Sleep Solution. A better more peaceful NO CRY way.	2002-06-22

I would have loved this book when my baby was a few weeks old since the ideas sound reasonable for the newborn stage. However, the suggestions don't work for an older baby. The 5 S's are: Swaddle (like my active 10 month old would go for this!) Put baby on his Side/Stomach (at 10 months you don't PUT him anywhere!) Shhhhh (he thinks that's funny) Swinging (I think every mother sways with a fussy baby, it's natural) Sucking (Oh, he does plenty of that, thank you!) I had to keep searching and luckily found a book for with plenty of answers, it's The No-Cry Sleep Solution, a great book for babies of any age since it also has a newborn section, maybe not as structured as this one, but lots of the same ideas. (Another thing that's rather weird, the endorsements for the Happiest Baby book come from Michelle Pfeiffer (actress) Pierce Brosnan (actor) plus lots of other actors and movie directors. I like movies, but when I want advice about baby-care I don't get why these endorsements mean anything.)	2002-06-22
