I found this book extremely boring and very hard to read.  The conversations don't flow and the interaction between characters seems abrupt.  In fact, I didn't even finish the book that is how borning it was.  Now, I don't normally review every book I read unless I have very strong feelings and this produced a very strong sense of a waste of time!!!  Do yourself a favor and get another book.

This was a wonderful book starting off with Sara who is a strongwilled reformer in England.  She gets it into her head that she is going to travel on a ship full of convict women to record the abuses they endure on the voyage to Austrilia and to teach them skiils they can use.  Just about halfway through their journey they are kidnapped by a Pirate Ship full of pirate's who want to settle down on a secluded island and start to live a &quot;normal&quot; life.  Sara faces up to Gideon (the Pirate Lord) and demands time for the convict women to choose which man they wish to marry.  Gideon agrees, although he is very slow in accepting this, and demands that Sara also choose a husband.  From there the fireworks just happen.  Both Sara and Gideon are very strong willed and have sharp tempers and tongues.  I loved this book, I couldn't put it down....the best thing I have read in awhile.	2001-11-08

While I thought the story line was good, I have to wonder if the story was finished the way the author invisioned it.  The book starts out with two people meeting at a charity ball and then a mysterious gunman kills Jonathan Steele's brother and sister-in-law (not a great loss).  From there the story starts to fizzle.  We never find out who the killer was. Then the FBI is mentioned like two times, but we never find out why they are involved.  I did like the romance between Cynthia and Jonathan, but felt the plot could have been developed more to have more of a side story.  I will admit it was an easy read (1 day), but I would have rather had a longer book with more explination and excitement.	2001-10-22

I was looking for either a story about each individual women or how they all interacted.  The book just seems to jump from one story to the next.  All the names were so similar that it was hard to keep track of who was from each family.  I never did quite get how they all interacted.  I know that they all knew each other from living on Troy Hill, but other than that.....<br />That being said, these women were all amazing.  They did was has to be done and didn't complain.  In reading this it was easy to see my own grandparents and understand a little better why they do the things they do....why relationships and family is so important.  The last chapter kind of made the book.  It talks about the vitures of friendship and how these women have been friends for so long that they wouldn't know what to do without the other.  It is rare to find a friendship like that in today's society.  Friends and Family are the world to these women....maybe we can all learn from that	2001-09-27

Averitt Lecture Series, No 7)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Rushed Effort	This book title seems to imply that the book will be about women/children being impacted by the civil war....what it really is, is a book about women's efforts for the South during the Civil war with a few mentions of children being left behind as orphans.  When it did mention the children becoming orphans it was as a passing glance or about how one of these women would try to help find their parents or how someone started an orphanage.  I was looking for a book that would give me the human side of the orphans life.  Someone to tell their side of the story with the uncertaninty and chilling conditions that some of them must have lived.  <br />That being said, this book is rich in the human history of the civil war.  It does tell about some very real women who helped during the war, but most of their problems which the books seems to highlight started long before the civil war even started.  I did enjoy learning about these women and it did make the civil war more peronsal....but this book is trying to be something it is not.	2001-08-01

Then there is the fact that my husband is also of Russian descent.  I picked Catherine the Great because she had such an influence and ruled for a long time.  I can't wait to read Erickson's new book about another Russian royal family. <br />It is rare for an author of a biography to write such that you think you are reading a fiction romance story, but that is just what Carolly Erickson has done.  I was drawn into the story of Catherine and her thoughts and feelings from the first page.  From her mother's ambition, to her own ambition, to the murder of her husband, to her many lovers.  The story just flows in an awesome fashion.  The only dissappointment was that the book seemed to gloss over Catherine's many acomplishments as a ruler. It did seem like the book was mosty about her early life and not enough about her rule.<br />This book will take a while to get throught, it is not an easy read, but is well worth it to understand the history of a people who are such a mystery to most American people.	2001-07-07

Reforming a Rake was your typical book about the man of the house being forced to play protector of his aunt and cousin.  Only Lucien REALLY seems to hate Rose and Fiona....not that I blame him because I didn't like Fiona either.  So he engages the beautiful Alexandra (Lex) to help &quot;polish&quot; Rose's skills to win a husband.  The only problem....Lucien falls for Lex and Fiona has her own designs on Lucien for Rose.  What happens next is a funny, sometimes boring (hey I can't lie) tale of three women and one man.  The part that saved the book was when Lucien kidnapped Lex and held her captive in his wine cellar and she got even with him by running his household staff all over creation to see to her comfort.  Which made me laugh becuase that sounds like something I would do.  All in all this book was good, but a little slow.	2001-07-06

You are probably wondering why I gave the book four stars and then the title is to leave the last story out.  Well, the reason was that the last story was totally inapporpriate for a collection of love stories.  It was dark and disturbing and I don't care to read something like that again.<br />The first two stories were pure magic.  I found the references to &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; very funny mostly because I loved that movie. The first story with the private eye and his daughter is all about misunderstandings and how they can blow things right out of proportion.  It was so nice to see two happy endings. The stories just flowed and made me feel like I was right in New Orleans at the ball.  Oh just once I want to be able to dress up in a fancy gown.  This was the next best thing.  Best of all, was that the stories were short and were easy to finish in a couple of hours without taxing your brain.	2001-05-03

All to save a certain someone the embarrasement of losing his distinguished career.<br />I found the book a little hard to get into, but after about 100 pages it went really fast and the ending shocked me!  It is a very good read and Tess is so much like your next door neighbor it is almost scary.	2001-05-02

She is deeply distraut and will do anything to clear her father's name of the stigma of suicide.  Adam comes onto the scene during the burial and from there it is just one lie after another.  Adam and Sabrina were betrothed when Sabrina was little more than in infant and now that her father is dead he is here to take control of her and her assets.  Well, Sabrina is not going to stand for that.  She lets Adam know exactly what she thinks about that!!!  (A girl after my own heart)  Sabrina has a tendency to bake when she is upset, which is quite a lot, and I loved this little quirky side to her.  Sabrina eventually manages to persuade Adam to help her clear her father's name.  What ensues is a funny, fast paced, and romantic story.  <br />I liked this book and found it very easy to read.  I did think that Sabrina was a little dense at times and the &quot;plot&quot; to capture the villian could have taken a few more twists and turns.  But all in all, it was a delightful story to read.	2001-04-13

If my husband hadn't reminded me that we had an appointment in the morning,I would have stayed up all night and finished the book.  As it was, I raced home and picked up the book from where I left off.  Jane is definately my type of heroine.  She lets people know what she thinks and has no problem standing up to dominering men (Tresham) who is used to getting his own way.  The problem is that he needs someone to stand up to him and help him see what life is all about (and love).  Jane is running and hiding from a terrible secret and will do almost anything to keep hidden.  Thus she accepts the offer of Tresham to be his mistress....but neither one of them counts of falling in love.

His big plan is to go sell the estate as soon as he can can get out of England, maybe China?  When he gets to Forton Hall he find the estate sadly lacking (totally run to the ground) and what he believes to be thieves.  Enter Lis (Felicity) and May who clobbers him over the head with a tea kettle.  From there the fireworks start of fly between Lis and Rafe.  All you need now is the villian, enter James stage right.  This was my only problem with the book ..... we know why James wants Forton Hall, which unfortunately makes the story kind of boring  (hence the four stars instead of five).....but all in all this book was great and the passion between Rafe and Lis is incredible.	2001-02-26

Stephanie is a down and out lacy pajama buyer who gets layed off from her job and doesn't want to tell her parents.  She has to sell most of her furniture and her car gets repossed.  Then her mom mentions that cousin &quot;Vinnie&quot; is looking for someone to do filing.  Stephanie goes for the job, but finds it filled.  So she blackmails Vinnie with family secrets to hire her on as a bail bond agent.  From here the laughs just keep going.  Stephanie is assigned to track down Joe Morelli a cop who is accused of murdering somone in cold blood.  Joe is also a sexy as hell guy who stole Stephanie's virginity.  She is out for revenge (and let me tell you that when she catches him he is madder than all get out).  Add an abusive boxer who is after Stephanie, a car bomb that blows up Joe's new car, and some drugs and you have the makings for an interesting book.

And you know what, I just stayed there and finished reading (I kept thinking it was probably safer for me). <br />Anyways this book starts out with Stephanie trying to talk her frined Carol out of jumping off of a bridge.  This is just the start to a funny (I mean exasperating)week for Stephanie.  Her mentor Ranger is accused of murdering a crime boss and has skipped his bail.  Stephanie being a bail bond anget is told to track him down (which she refuses).  So, she is sent after three other people, two of which come nicely.  The thrid tries to kill her multiple times.  Add in a grandmother who is sick of living with Stephanie's mom, a bunch of hitmen from the crime family, some cars being blown up, and a co-worker who wants Stephanie to dog-sit and you have a teriffic receipie for disaster and adventure.

Little did I know that Leon (Lord Savage) is not really a savage at all and the books makes a dismal attempt to pretend that he is.  For all of Ariel's brains, I am surprised that she didn't pick up on this little fact from the start.  Then there is the whole &quot;taming&quot; process, which I found to be quite dull until Leon decides to teach Ariel how to flirt, so that she can marry the headmaster to save her family from gambling debts.  I guess this is where the romance part of the book starts.  Although, it is hard to see until about 3/4 of the way through the book.  <br />The comes the really confusing part.  Of course they sleep together and the question comes up of Ariel's virginity.  I must say that I am still quite confused on this subject.  The author makes it out to be that she was not a virgin, but then also says something about a &quot;lie and a test&quot; for Leon.  Then add in the ending where Leon realizes that he is behaving just like his father and leaving behind the woman he loves. Pregnant?  This little tidbit had nothing to do with Leon coming back or so I am hoping because it is never really resolved at the end of the book.<br />All in all, this was a good book for a vacation read, but for serious romance reading, pick something different.	2001-01-07

I happened to love it.  I read it while I was layed up on vacation with a skiing injury and I was so engrossed in the book that I didn't even notice when the bag of ice melted and started to get my sweats and the couch wet.  While I did not agree with some of things that Mr. Sandford had Lucas doing (even thinking about sleeping with a married women just isn't my style).  I loved how the book seemed to focus on Alie'e death and not Sandy Lang's. In the end it turns out not to be the death of Alie'e that was the first murder.  It just goes to show you what mixing drugs will do to people and even to the police when a famous person is involved.  Like I said earlier, this book was so gripping that I can forgive Lucas for seeming like a playboy instead of a cop.	2001-01-05

This was my first Anne Perry mystery and unless something else by her is more interesting, she is going on my don't read list.  What was the real story/mystery here?  It seemed like half of the book revolved around Caroline and Joshua and their marraige.  I saw only a minor connection of this story with the murder of the photographer.  Are Caroline and Joshua really supposed to be the central characters or is it Pitt and the murder.  While I do applaud the author for tackling the tough subject of censorship and the right for women to divorce thier husbands, I can not in good conscience give this book any better than two stars, it just didn't flow or come together.	2001-01-05

Stefan is the son of the dying king and is being forced to marry (against his wishes?) to a princess that he was engaged to when she was little more than an infant.  Because of family hatred, the baby (Tayna) was secreted out of the country to be raised like a royal in America.  Only her protector dies and leaves her in the hands of a cruel tavern owner who sees Tayna little more than a slave.  Tayna grow up to be a very independent woman who is accustomed to life's hardships and cruel tricks.  Is it no wonder that when Stefan shows up and tells her she is a princess that she doesn't believe him? <br />From there it is a merry chase with numerous escape attempts (all of them failed).  Finally they arrive in Stefan's homeland only to be greated by Stefan's mistress (I was a little disturbed by the caviliar attutidue the author portrayed to this subject) who tries to kill Tayna.  Then out of nowhere (like 5 pages from the end) comes Ivan Stroboli, the last remaining member of a family that killed the rest of Tayna's family.  He just appears in her room and tries to kill her, but Stefan shows up just in time, but for a totally unlreated issue.  <br />I thought the plot of the book was weak and if not for the constant fighting of Tayna and Stefan the book wouldn't have held my attention.  I also thought that Ivan could have been integrated more into the book to give the plot a little more help and life.	2000-12-19

I have to say that my favorite story was &quot;The Trouble with Hannah&quot; (it coudl be the name).  I found so many similaries to todays world where parents don't take enough time for their children and the children get angry.  All it takes is a little love, some turn about is fair play, and yes some discipline to bring not only Hannah around, but also her guardians.

We see right away that Jody is attracted to the hero (even though he has been dead for 120 years).  Then she travels back in time, but I was never sure how she really got there (other than the vodoo doll).  What triggered the travel?

But what was the real story here?  Was it the love that overcame mistrust?  Was it who was trying to dirty Thorne's name?  Was it the fight between the English and the Welsh?  I was never quite sure.  The book basicly boiled down to the heroine backing down up until the end and then the dense hero coming to his senses and realizing that not only does he love her, but she does indeed love him back.	2000-12-09

I admit it, I first felt sorry for Heather when I read that she had a limp.  But we really quickly learn not to pitty her.  She is truly a strong women.  Her parents recognized it and gave her an estate to run.  Then Damien comes along, a godsend, to help her run her estate.  Little does she know that he is really after her REAL father and doesn't want to love her.  The chemistry is almost instant, but alas doom comes when Damien doesn't believe that she doesn't remember her real father and forces her adoptive parents to reveal all.  The a chance meeting in London reignites the passions and the game is on.  Lets us just say that it is a true romance novel from here on.  The love blooms, but so does the danger.  I learned to love Heather's independance, but underneath it all, she is searching for someone to love her (aren't we all).	2000-12-09

Now I understand that in a series the key is to leave questions at the end so that people would buy the next book.  But part of the key is also to explain things in the beginning so that people who have never read the series could pick up some of the important facts.  This book did not do that and I, as a first time reader, was left wondering who in the world Carrie was and why she was a major player.  It wasn't until halfway thru the book that I got a real sense of the horror that this young woman could inflict.  I found Dr. Kay Scarpetta to be a likeable person who was having the troubles that we all have.  Her romance with Benton was fading and they were trying to hang on.  Her relationship with her niece was on the rocks, but hey whoes isn't from one time to another.  Then she is called in on a weird fire that killed not only a woman, but a bunch of prized horses.  I am still not sure what the point of killing the horses and letting the one escape was...it was never explained.  I also agree with other readers that The Point of Origin was never fully explained.  I know it has something to so with the silver box fire starter, but I was never really sure.  All in all, it was a well written book, just holes in the plot.	2000-10-19

On the way she becomes sick and is expected to die.  Along comes Adrian, the Duke of Raven, he is so obsessed with on marrying and being tied down to a woman that he thinks marrying Leah and the playing the grieving widower will keep him out of the &quot;marraige mart and the matchmaking mamas&quot;.  Little does he know that Leah is destined not to die and thus begins the very funny tale of Leah and Adrian.  Leah is such a strong character that stands up to Adrian when she wants something.  She is very good at adapting to her surroundings and making the best of any situtation.  I thought that when Adrian tried to suduce Leah in the artist studio was so funny.  But then when he broke her heart, I didn't think anyone could be that cruel.  Through it all Leah bears every situtation with quiet self-assurance and proves that love can win in the end.	2000-10-08

I like Vicky much better than Ms. Peabody that I too am hoping that Ms. Peters will return to Vicky and give us more great adventures to laugh about.

I found her to be a refreshing writer who writes what she knows about and has characters who are real.  Sammantha is an honest to God hard working young women who is just trying to make ends meet.  Jack is a rich bachelor who will do anything to  make his sister happy, even being unhappy himself.  Then Sam comes to Jack's room to alter his tux and wham....the whole thing begins.  I can't say that I blame Sam for taking the money to be Jack's wife-to-be when a loan shark is after her. ( I can't say that I blame her for going to the loan shark in the first place....to bury her mother.)  I did find that the book &quot;suddenly resolved&quot; the problem of telling the family that Sam is Sam and not the real wife-to-be, but the love story of the two falling in love is enough to make anyones heart miss a beat.	2000-10-03

I was so surprised that I dropped the book and lost my place.  The plot just moves along with characters that seem like real humans and it was almost like watching a movie in my mind.  The interaction of Goldy and Arch is so much like watching my own mother with my youngest brother and her attempt to &quot;get it right, but not smother&quot;.  Because this book took me only two days to read, I can't wait until I get my hands on the next one.  On a side note, the recepies look so good that I am going to have to try a couple.  If you are looking for a fun suspense book without too much gore and a real explosive ending than this one is for you.	2000-09-28

At first I thought the book was a little scatter brained and it might have done better to have a flashback scene rather than the constant jumping back and forth from the past to the present.  Once I got to a point where the story was all future is when the book really started to take off.  From then on, I couldn't put the book down because the characters seemed to come to life on the pages.  The betrayal, hurt, and forgiveness that these characters protrayed was so real.  I would have never guessed who the real &quot;bad guy&quot; turned out to be.  Well, since this is my second time trying to review this book, it has been a while since I read it, I don't really remember what the characters names are, but the feelings the thought of this book envokes are described above.  This was a good book and a great read.	2000-09-27

This was a great change of pace from Ms. Becnel's other books.  I loved the way that Eliza &quot;got away&quot; from her future husband and managed to not only get herself, but her young cousin on a 6 month cruise to the south of France.  In comes Cyprian whoes hatred of Aubrey's father has consumed his life.  When he first sees that his henchmen have not only kidnapped Aubrey, but Eliza as well, he is furious.  But as time goes on he is drawn to her and begins to teach her the joys of love as well as some pretty steamy sex.  Then he has what I call &quot;an attack of the stupids&quot; and hurts her so bad that she wants nothing to do with him ever again.

I loved this book.  I picked it up to read on a four hour plane ride and then couldn't put it down with only 100 pages left to read.  I must say that I totally ingored everyone until the book was done.  Gillian is such a strong heroine that I felt real emotions for her.  I cried when her uncle beat her, I laughed when she didn't realize that she had married Brodrick.  Brodrick is also a wonderful character.  He truely is concerened about Gillian and I don't blame him for &quot;fibbing&quot; about waiting to go after the three rotten english lords who have hurt her most of her life.  All I can say is that I am eagerly awaiting Ms. Garwoods next novel.	2000-09-26

I felt that it just lacked the drama to  keep the reader interested.  I kind of felt that the Aunts were just a side  part of the book and they should not have been.  I also felt that it wasn't  clearly portrayed that both Sally and Gillian were &quot;witches&quot; and  why Sally was so determined to not bring her girls up that way.  I also  felt the appearance of Gary didn't make any sense since he was only in the  last three chapters and his character was never developed beyond a side  character to whom Sally falls in love with.  We don't know why she falls in  love she just does.  To her credit Ms. Hoffman is a remarkable writer and I  would purchase books by her again.	2000-09-19

At first the book started out  awesome.  What could be better than a midnight robbing of a Soviet musuem,  followed by a greedy theif who lifts something he isn't supposed to, then  two dead bodies and the list goes on.  I felt the action of the book moved  right along and the sparring between Faith and Walker was wonderful.  Right  up until the last few chapters.  Then things started to get really slow.   For one thing, for a Russian mafia to not show up the whole time Faith and  Walker were at Ruby Bayou was just not believeable and then for him to show  up at the end.  Well, it was almost like Ms. Lowell just remembered that he  was a central character.  Then the whole part where Walker disappears into  the Bayou is just a great mystery.  All we know is that two went out and  one came back....I think the ending of the book could have been spiced up  with a chapter regarding the struggle on the skif in the middle of the  swamp.  I was also a little disappointed in that all of a sudden Walker  decides he wants Faith in his life permanently and some of how he reached  that decision would have been helpful.  All in all it was an entertaining  read and I will be looking forward to Ms. Lowells next book.	2000-09-03

The first 100 pages just confused me.  This book should have started off with the a brief history of how Sherrie  and Jack met.  Instead you are totally thrown of course by Sherrie's vivid  dreams.  It just went down hill from there.  I did not find this book  strong in any way except for the fact that Minerva and her mother had to  have been the most unconventional women.  They didn't really seem to fit in  with the time peroid.  I could have beileved in them if they were from  today's world, but back then......I don't think so.

This book struck so close to  home.  I was once interviewed for a newspaper before going on a ballet  related trip to the Soviet Union and even though I was not quotted, some of  my friends were and they got into huge trouble just because the reporter  had ommited a few words to totally change the context of their thoughts.   So, I could relate to this book.  While I felt for Lily, I also felt that  she should not have been so believing of Terry.  I mean, he is a reporter  and we all know that reporters never go off the job.  But the degree with  which Terry ruined Lily's life was just uncalled for.  At first John  started out not much better, he was only in it to write his book.  But as  he got to know Lily he turned out to be a great guy.  All I have to say  about the ending is that Terry got what he deserved and more.  A true  justice if there ever was one.	2000-08-08

I mean, who in their right mind would allow the FBI to  pressure you into seeing a father you haven't seen in 30 years.  I know  that I wouldn't.  Then there was the &quot;romance&quot; between Sloan and  Noah...not believeable at all....I can't believe Ms. McNaught actually  thought that she was writing about romance and not lust.

It seemed like all the information in this book espically about conception could be obtained by paying attention in health class while you were in high school.   I found it particularly disturbing that this book doesn't even mention the  fact that when the tiny dividing cells implants in the uterus that it  may  be possible to bleed and therefore think you are having a period.  (This  happened to my friend and she didn't even know she was pregnant until she  was two months along).  My doctor assures me this is very normal and  happens to a lot of women.

The mother, loses herself and just walks right out of the  country.  This forces each of her children to take a different path.  Each  reacting to the circumstances.<br />This book is narriated by each of the four  girls and through this you learn each personality.  The girls then go on to  tell what happened throughout their lives (until the oldest is 50).  It was  interesting to see how each one reacted differently to their experiences in  the Congo.<br />I found this book so heavy that at times I could only read one  chapter at a time.

Being a novice on the pyraminds, I found this book absolutely fascinating.  To think that all those years ago the people of Egypt could have known that much information about the stars is amazing.  We usually think of  these people as undeveloped, but if the pyramids are truly as complex as  these two think than we are talking a whole different ball game.  As a  novice, I do have a couple of comments about how the book was written.  For  the most part it flowed fairly smooth.  There were a couple of spots where  I felt the authors delved a &quot;little too deep&quot; with technical  information.  But than again, the book was intended to bring attention from  the professional fiend about their work, not to be read by a woman engineer  who has no experience with the pyramids.  One warning, have a lot of time  if you are not familiar with the pyramids because it will take you awhile  to get thru all the information and make sense of it all.	2000-03-23

I bought it on the recommendation of a friend who told me that this would help me improve my self-esteem about my &quot;rounded&quot; body type.  I tried so hard, but was unable to see where this book was going and how it was supposed to help me.  Now, I don't  claim to be an avid reader of nonfiction, but there were times I would read  passages over and over and over again to try and make sense of what she was  trying to say and what it meant to me.  Don't get me wrong it was an  intersting book, but I failed to see how it helped me (not everyone, just  me).....Bottom line, it will be a long time before I personally read  something from this offer again, it just took to much work to figure out  what she was trying to say.	2000-03-19

I really felt the passion, anger, and sorrow that the characters had.  Lady Rowena was the strongest female heroine I have read in a long time.  She stood up for herself and made her  life better than it would ever have been living in a convant.  I truly felt  for her when her husband turned away from her on their wedding night.  I  can not imagine the pain she must have felt.  Rannulf is a despicible man  in the beginning, but after you begin to understand why he is the way he  is, you begin to see the change in him.  By the end of the story I like him  almost as much as Rowena.  This book was a joy to read and highly  recommended.  <br />I just have one question, what does the title have to do  with the book?	2000-03-16

This time with a twist.  She grow up with a bunch of sailors teaching her to be a lady.  By bullying her way into a position as  a translator on a ship to Rio she comes to &quot;draw-out&quot; each member  of the crew who teaches her a different aspect of how to be a  &quot;lady&quot;.  The ending had me going for awhile so I won't give it  away, but it was not what I expected.  I found this book to be very  entertaining and to heroine kind of like me today who is &quot;book  smart&quot; and feels like she is lacking social graces.  It is nice to  know that things can and usually do work out.....that some men take the  time to look beyond glasses and the wrong clothes.  This book was very  funny and an enjoyable read.  Highly recommended!	2000-03-15

This book was very good, but knowing the ending I do have a couple of comments.  Why the creator of the book when he first saw Maggie chose to make the &quot;Shadow Woman&quot; in the  game a slave was not to my liking.  It kind of had a demeaning quality to  it.  The second comment I have is that this book had no real ending.  You  turn the page expecting to hear what happended when they tried to return  from this &quot;Virtual World&quot; and then nothing.....I was very  disappointed in that.  Now those things being said, this book was also a  very good book.  The characters kept my attention mostly because Maggie  would not submit and act like a slave and the antics she got into where  very funny.  This book was highly enjoyable and I would recommend it to  people.	2000-03-11

I know that some men looked at women that way during the time period this book was written in, but to have the author come out and say that the father valued is books and work more than his child was almost too much for  me.  Then when the &quot;hero&quot; took the same attitude I was ready to  scream.  This book did have its good points in that the story was  interesting about how they traveled all over to get to her &quot; long lost  relative&quot; for the sake of a crystal ball, only to discover that they  had been thrown in prision.  So they end up traveling to his home in  England where they finally find peace and the older magician the  &quot;hero&quot; sets out to find.  It really was an enjoyable story once I  got past the attitudes of the men.	2000-03-11

It was nice to have bits of future events to be helpful in seeing how events shapped peoples lives.  It was a little scary how because of one childhood incident Amy gets her kicks  out of &quot;nrrdy men&quot;.  I did feel that Isabelle hung onto the  circumstances a bit too long.  But I can also sympathize with her about her  shyness coming across as being snobbish.  This book is definately not meant  for a one sitting book, it is to heavy and really makes you think.  But  overall a good book.	2000-03-02

After that, it went downhill fast.  There just didn't seem to be any new and exciting ideas that sprung out of this book.

It could have ended a long time before it actually did and would have been a perfectly good book.  It was a strugle to finish with Hugh being such a pigheaded man.  The way he treated Edlyn,  like a possession, was totally uncalled for. Normally, I don't get all  &quot;hot and bothered&quot; about the way men treat woman in these books  because they usually come around in the end.  But at the end of this book,  I was not so sure that Hugh really did come around or if Edlyn just gave  up. I found this book lacking with Ms. Dodd's usual storytelling abilities.   This book just didn't grab me and wrap me in the way her other books did.	2000-02-24

I think that part of it may be that the names were hard to work out the way they sounded in your head.  I thought the book would have been much better if the  characters names that been easier to read.  The story seemed to be going no  where fast and then it picked up somewhere around page 75.

On top of that, the simple ones didn't really seem to be that inventive.  For all of the hype this book got  in my Weight Watchers meeting, it was really disappointing.  Another  things, which others have mentioned, is that it doesn't give the serving  size.  Yes, on some of the dishes it is easy to divide the dish into the  number of servings it says it makes, but some of the others are not so  easy.  If they can figure out the points my serving that why can't they  list the serving size.  This is especially important if you don't have the  normal 4 or five people which the recepie makes food for, to dish out one  serving is very difficult.	2000-02-08

For a romance novel, I had to pay a suprising about of attention to little details that I normally would  over look.  But to the same extent, I also skipped two chapters in the  middle and was able to catch back up with little difficulity.  I found that  the book started out good, but toward the middle it kind of faded and  started to get old.  It was a real disappointment for such a good begining.   On the whole though, the book was well written and for the most part  interesting.  A good book if you have the time to give the book the  attention that it needs.	2000-02-02

Henry is such a strong character that doesn't like being told what to do.  It was so interesting to read about how pig headed Dunford was being.  I rather liked all of the teasing that  his friends gave him.  The only thing was that I felt Henry should have  been more trusting of Dunford, then the last 50 pages could have been  avoided.  They had so much trouble getting together that to have yet  another problem put in their path was almost an over-kill.  Still, the book  was very good and a delight to read.	2000-01-29

It was an average book with nothing that really stands out about it.  It look four days to read and for me that is a huge amount of time.  I just couldn't sit down and read it in  one sitting.  It was almost too heavy.  At the begining Ms. Fforde tried to  write in the &quot;english&quot; language, well for an American, it was  very hard to read.  Finally she stopped and from then on, I didn't have to  half way guess what the characters are saying.  The story is a little hard  to follow in that the three characters lead almost seperate lives.  The  only thing they have in common is that they live and work together and that  is not even discussed that much.  It was much more like trying to read  three stories that were interuppted and had big time gaps.  I guess if you  didn't have anything better to do this book would fill a couple of days.	2000-01-25

It was so funny and comical, but it really shows the difference in the thought process of a man and a woman.  I couldn't stop laughing when Emmalene went before the king  to have the king order her husband to have sex with her.  I was laughing so  hard my husband thought something was wrong with me.  Then the part where  the people are standing outside the door and yell &quot;Is the Deed  Done?&quot; every two minutes was just cracking me up.  So the jist of this  little review is, if you love a good laugh and a cute story, READ THIS  BOOK.  But be forwarned that if you get embarresed about showing emotion in  public, don't read this is a public place.

Every time I turned the page I was laughing out-loud.  My husband even came in the room several times and asked if I was o.k. and what I was laughing at.  I think that Chloe was a  very determined and supper funny heronine and that Lord Sexton gets just  what he needs as a wife.  This book was not what the back lead me to  believe, but it is more about their marraige and how they learn to tell  each other that they love each other.  I was a little disappointed in the  last chapter.  I thought that there could have been more explination about  how Lord Sexton comes about discover that he loves Chloe.  But on the whole  it was a fantastic book.  Don't pick this one up unless you don't want to  go to sleep.	2000-01-03

It moved a little slow until about half way through it, but it was worth the wait to read.  There were so many questions that I had, then it really started to take off once they got to  the &quot;Valley&quot;.  The ending was a little strange though.  It didn't  totally answer all my questions about the &quot;demons&quot; and how they  got to the valley in the first place.  This is most definately not a quick  read.  Like I said it is slow almost dragging in the beginning, but it  makes up for it at the end by explaining most of the history about why  these two people got kicked out.  It doesn't however describe why these two  are being let back in.  If you sit down to read this book, have lots of  time or plan on putting it down.	2000-01-02

I had to stay up half the night finishing it.  The stroy just flowed from one chapter to the  next.  In fact, I hardly noticed that it was 1:30 a.m. when I finished it.  Tessa is such a  strong female character and sure gives Galahad a run for his money about  his Middle Ages beliefs.  You could not ask for a better book to curl up  with in front of the fire on a cold winter or rainy night.  A truely  wonderful book.  A must read!	1999-12-31

The whole casting off the second twin and then having to bring her back  because the other is dying is kind of a little far fetched if you are  to believe the time frame when this story takes place.  For a civilization  that can travel the stars to still be practicing this type of backwards  ritual is just a little too tough to swallow.  The second problem is that  the story doesn't flow.  The book seems to get stuck on the &quot;ocean  voyage&quot; of Singai and Quinn.  The fact that they seem to  &quot;rescue&quot; each other every other page is also a little old.  It is  kind of like, how many injuries or illnesses can two people get.<br />The good  part about the book is that the sex if very descriptive, if you like that  sort of thing.  Singai is also a very strong heroine and is able to mostly  defend herself and really help out on the voyage.  I thought this book was  just a fun, mindless read and am glad that I wasn't rushed when I was  reading it.  It is definately a book that can be picked up and read at  almost any place.  Don't feel you have to read this all in one sitting or  else you might be bored to tears.	1999-12-29

It was a little slow in the middle, but on the whole it was very good.  Zoe was a really strong woman and is trying to do what a million of other women are trying to do.

For one Amazon book recommender was right on with my tastes.  I wasn't sure about this book in the begining because it didn't explain anything about why Kari was so  driven to please her father at any cost.  Once I figured things out it was  a very enjoyable read.  The books one major flaw was that it didn't come to  an ending.  It just kind of leaves you hanging about what happens to all  but the main two characters and even that is kind of hanging.  You know  they get married (come one I didn't really spoil anything did I?), but  beyond that what happens to them?  It just smells a little like a sequal  and me spending more money.	1999-12-24

For all the praise this book has gotten from other reviews, I was really disappointed in the way this book dragged on and on.  I bought this book after amazon recommended it and I saw the high praise from other reviewers.   I am not saying it is a bad book, but it really drags sometimes.  Sabrina  and Morgan are both to hung up on the past and all the figthing that has  happened with their clans.  The whole story hinges on this Eve character,  who is the bad person.  I had this figured out in the first chapter.  I  guess if you had to have a long book for a car ride or an airplane ride  that this would be for you, but otherwise skip this one.	1999-12-12

I didn't particularly think it was the best book I have ever read, but it was not the worst.  I thought the book was good, but that it just dragged on and on.  I am not  sure if it was the writing or what......  It is o.k.,if you have a lot of  time to spend reading, but not for a quick read.  It is emotional, but not  overly so.	1999-12-04

Finally a heroine that is strong and someone to really look up to and wish that you were more like her.  She fights for what she wants and gets into trouble like all of us.  She is very real and  very believable.  Maybe not in her time period, but in ours and it is not  hard to make believe.	1999-12-01

I mean we all know how it is going to end, but the way in which they are forced to deal with each other is very unique.  I have not read this particular plot before.  It doesn't take a  rocket scientist to figure out how it ends, but a good easy read.	1999-11-16

It was just a good thing that I didn't have any more books in the house or I would not have finished this book.  It is so predictable and there was just not anything new that hasn't been  written before.  On the plus side, the heroine is a very strong willed  character which is a good role model for the young women today.	1999-11-14

My husband and I are planning on buying our first house in less than two months.  I wanted to see what type of advice the author gave before I went  out and spent the money on a book.  (We are on quite a tight budget, my  husband is finishing school.)  I thought this book gave me lots of  &quot;direction&quot; and helpful advice on where to start.  Although, I do  disagree with the author about the bedroom being the most important place  to decorate.  I believe the kitchen is the most important.  But that is a  matter of personal opinion.  She gave me lots of ideas about  how to go  about furnishing a room etc.  The only problem with this book that I can  see is that there is no real help when it comes to choosing colors for room  and no &quot;instructions&quot; on where to place furniture.  I think a  little more &quot;insturction&quot; in classical placement and color would  have made the book a little better.  On the whole it is a very helpful book  and high on my list of things to buy when we do get our new (first) house.	1999-07-19

The book just drags  and never goes anywhere.  I am glad that I just got it from the library to  try out the author.  I won't be reading anything by this author again	1999-07-16

It was a little slow, but on the whole the story was good.  I did wish for a little more background on who the quilt was made for and why it was made.  The book never really tells you, it just  gives you the characters guesses.  At time the book seemed to drag, but it  was mainly because you didn't know what Rachel's motivation for doing  things was.  I had a hard time telling what was her and what was the  quilt's influence.  On the whole I liked this book and may read another by  this author.	1999-07-16

At first I wasn't sure where this book was headed, but something made me keep reading, and I am glad that I did.  This book is much more than one story, it is two.  I was so  happy to see that the book didn't end with Jessica's life being put back  together.  It went on to give the reader more of what every reader  wants....A longer story involvoing the lovable characters.  This book was a  true delight to read.  Definately a must read for anyone who loves happy  endings.	1999-07-12

It is one thing to suggest thigs which this book does, but it still tells you to go hire a professional to do the work.  I wanted something to tell me  how to do some of the ideas listed, but not in this book.  It did give lost  of advice that I would pass on to an interior decorator working for me, but  I want to save money.   This book was a waste of money for me.	1999-07-11

Each feels that they can't do anything right for the generation that follows them.  Then slowly they begin to understand each other and  each others needs, but with the threat of a stalker hovering over them.   They work through old problems and old hurts, but the threat is still  there.  I enjoyed reading this book a lot and would recommend it to anyone  who wanted to spend some time thinking about their own relationship with  their mother.  Not a book for a quick read.  I really thought about when my  mother and I were going through this particular stage, when I was reading  this book.  I can't give the book away, but I was very surprised who the  &quot;stalker&quot; turned out to be.  Enjoy this book, it is suspensful,  but without all of the gross, really scarry things like in a King novel.	1999-07-10

I guess I just am left feeling let-down.  I was not drawn into the story at all.  In fact, I found the plot a little too  predicitible.  I also felt that Althea worried too much about her kids for  almost half of the book.  No real person worries that much and pushes off  the man as many times as she did.  I couldn't quite understand why Patrick  kept coming back to her.  It is a good book to read if you just want  something for here and there, but don't waste your time if you want to get  into the book and the characters.  I found myself having to put the book  down because I was feeling &quot;bogged&quot; down with reading it.  I did  finish the book, which does say that it has some redeaming qualities, but  there are not many.	1999-07-08

I really enjoyed the story and the little bit of history that the book entailed.  It was different from the typical love story in that it  had a bit of mystery.  I must also admit that the mystery did not stump me.   I had it figured out after a couple of chapters, but it was still fun to  read and see if I was right.  The only thing that I would have wished for  was a little more/better description of the physical settings in the book,  such as the house that was being restored and the &quot;plain&quot;  ancestor who comes back as a ghost.  On the whole, it was a good book,  which I finished in one day, if that tells you anything. I couldn't put it  down!!!!!  Recommended very highly!!!!	1999-07-06

It made me go out and look up more of her other books to read.  I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!  It made me realize how special my best friends are and how  important it is to talk to them about all of your feelings.  I just got  married and read this book before I picked my bridesmaids.  I think it  really meant a lot to those young woman to hear why I had picked them and  how very special they were to me.  This book was what made me realize it.   It is a book for anyone who has ever wanted to laugh and cry at the same  time.  It is about &quot;REAL&quot; people facing real situations and the  feelings that we all feel.  I could not put this book down and would highly  recommend this book to anyone.  READ IT!!!!  YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!	1999-07-06

Usually I look forward to going home to be with my husband, but after starting this I just wanted  to go home and read.  To be honest I finished the book the very same day I  started reading it.  I was very surprised at the twists and turns the book  took towards the ends.  I did think that the chasing of Evageline and  Danior was a bit excessive and got old after a while.

I felt that at sometimes Jane was a bit to obsessive about the Earl's behavior.  But on the other hand I couldn't put it down because I never knew what she was  going to insist on doing with him next.  I was very surprised about who the  mother of the child actually turns out to be and would recommend this book  just based off of that twist.  I think this is truly a well written book,  even if I don't like the way the heroine acts sometimes.  But it does go to  show that true love does win out in the end, even if it does take a LONG  TIME.  A good book to read!!!	1999-07-02
