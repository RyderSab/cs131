I just love when my favorite conservative writers/radio commentators have gotten a bunch of 1 star ratings from the mind numbed liberal left, because then I know they've hit a nerve. It does warm my heart to know that so many libs have spent their checks on supporting the works of such greats as Hannity, Rush, Savage, & now Gallagher!! I plan on buying one for all my friends and family for Christmas and so should you!!	2005-07-19

The premise is providing sexual scenarios to the reader to give to their husbands. For instance, husband and wife are in the car going some where, the wife is to tell the husband to imagine she's the babysitter and then pull off somewhere to recreated this fantasy. Older man driving teen girl home, while his wife and children are left behind, then things get sexual.<br /><br />First off, not many men have that imagination, second how many wives are going to allow their husband a fantasy about having sex with a teen babysitter.<br /><br />This book might fly if you're 13, otherwise save your and spend it on a movie at Blockbuster or a nice bottle of wine.	2005-07-12

I thought this was a good book, which was dated, yet dealt with an important topic yesterday as it is today; abortion. It was well written and easy to read. Actually had trouble putting it down. If you are strictly anti-abortion you may not like this book, if you're able to put that aside you may like it. I did slam nurses though and I didn't like that aspect of the book. Given the times when it was written, nurses were really looked down upon. Unfortunately many of those stereotypical misconceptions from the point of view of the doctor still carry over today 37 years later. Also brought up the unwritten law of medicine, never to turn against your brother MD no matter how incompetent and dangerous they practice. Another code still largely unbroken today.	2005-02-22

It was easy to read, presented a lot of facts about Zaire, and was extremely descriptive when it came to dealing with the police, soldiers, custom officials, hotel accomodations etc. My only criticism is he tended to go on at length about his guide and his religious rantings. Toward the end it seemed as though he had written more about his guide and their relationship than he was about the country. Don't let that stop you from reading this book because it is full of facts which he has incorporated into his experience. I'll be ordering his other books to read them as well after reading this book. I think you'll enjoy it.	2005-02-07

How many people who read this book will stop sending checks to these groups? People friendly to these groups will then provide a poor review of the book.<br /><br />As for the book, it's as good as Clancey. The story moves fast and yet he is able to provide a lot of insight into the workings of these environmental groups. I highly recommend this novel to any one. Oh, and it is just a novel. Some of the reviewers have critisized it's scientific merit, that's why it's called a novel.<br /><br />If you are one of these environmentalist who believe the world is going to end any day now from global warming, then this book isn't for you. Go rent \\"The Day After\\" at your local video store. The movie's a stinker, but it feeds into the environmentalist paranoia.	2004-12-24

That part of the novel was very good. Ish the main character of the book was the leader of a small community of survivors. He sees himself as the most intelligent of them all and for some reason wants to keep it that way. He locks up a library and only he has access to it. Once children are born and old enough to go to school he cancels it, no children of the new world learn to read. Nobody seems to want to become self-sufficient but relies on the products of a past civilization. A stranger comes to join them and Ish murders him out of jealously that his role might be challenged. From then on he carries the hammer he killed the stranger with, with him all the way to his death. No interest was ever sparked by anyone to learn to read, farm, make things or anything else. Everyone lives off of canned goods for 20+ years. I won't say anything more in case the reader of this has not read the book and would like too. Ultimately I was disappointed but would recommend it anyway.	2004-12-19

After training for a month he then was in charge of a small river running boat for another 3 months before he was a able to manuever his way out of Vietnam leaving behind his comarades in arms. Upon his arrival back to the states he took part in the character assassination of the men he left behind. He lied about every aspect of his 4 month tour of duty to the point where one would have to determine he's a pathological liar much like the SNL character played by Jon Lovitz. Curious how the tactics of Kerry and McAuliff in their character assassination of George Bush's military career has backfired in to their own little military scandel. Their same bag of dirty tricks used against them and now they whine about the unfairness of it all. A great book which exposes the type of cowardly man John Kerry really is. If you can get your hands on one, it's a great read. Obviously their is an active effort to keep this book off of bookstore shelves. Even Amazon.com may not be able to deliever this book until immediately prior to the election. Never before have I seen such a successful effort to blacklist a book. Certainly there has never been any problem in getting the numerous Bush Bashing books to the book stores accross America.	2004-08-23

Audie Murphy probably the highest decorated soldier in the history of America didn't even get to come home early for the medals he won.<br /><br />If your unable to obtain the blacklisted book \\"Unfit for Command\\" I'd highly recommend this book as it backs up everything the former presents. The only factual error I found in this book was that the author wrote that F-102's were not in Vietnam. F-102's were in fact in Vietnam. George Bush tried to get an assignment flying F-102's in Vietnam but was turned down because he had not acquired 500 hours of training time that was required. The F-102 was taken out of Vietnam in Dec of '69 George Bush was not completed with his 500 hours until Jun of 1970.<br /><br />In any case I highly recommend this book as a companion to \\"Unfit For Command\\" !!	2004-08-23

He didn't graduate from West Point, his discipline of his troops was lax in comparison to other generals, and he obviously wasn't in the club with Bradley, Ike, and Patton. While Patton did stand up for him in the invasion of Sicily, Ike wanting to can him, Patton insisted he remain in command of his Big Red One. Patton would do things like pee into Gen Allen's slit trench in front of Allen's men, effectively calling him a coward in not so many words. Two of Allen's men took their tommy guns off of safe into fire mode with an audible click at which point Patton left.  I would recommend this book to any WW II buff.	2004-05-31

Getting past all that, since none of the one star reviewers have not even read this book, I'll try to fill them in. It's not about the left, it's not about the right, it's about the powerful in this country and how they try to get over the average American. Weather it's Jessie Jackson making millions for himself while the people he professes to be helping go with out, to the poor ghettos where the people are terrorized by the drug dealers because the politicians won't stop it, to the worker getting screwed by management.

It is however a very well written, concise autobiography of a person who has over come being sexually, financially, and emotionally exploited by men. This is a story about how a little girl who grew up in a physically abuse house hold, was raped at the age of ten and then emotionally manipulated for sex or money only to be thrown away during her teens. Traci Lords was sucked down into a life of drugs, sex, and pornography as child. While this part of her life is well documented in this book the real story is how she climbed her way out, cleaned herself up and pursued a career in acting, modeling, and singing. She eventually married a good man who loved her for who she is despite of what her life had been. This is truely a heart breaking story of a little girl who's childhood dreams were stolen from her and how she reclaimed those dreams as an adult. As I read this book I just wanted to reach in and grab her away from this terrible life she had to endure of perverts, pediphiles and rapists and provide her with a safe home to grow up in. Like the saying goes the best revenge is success and it seems Traci Lords has turned out to be very successful. The porn industry seems to have no love for her, her porn fans only have lust for her, but I think anyone else who reads this autobiography will have a respect for how far she has come in life. Good job Traci and the best to you always. I hope this book may be an inspiration and possibly a salvation for anyone who may be going down the road you have gone.	2003-08-10

Europe is being over run with immigrants from the middle east, America is being hardest hit with their uncontrolled influx of peoples from around the world, and soon Russia and New Zealand will be the next countries to suffer the wrath of unlimited uncontrolled immigration policies. America need not fear invasion from the outside, we would crush any country who tried, but attack from within is very possible. Look at all of the foreign born immigrant taxi drivers in New York, who could pack their taxis with explosives and every street and building in NYC could be damaged or distroyed not to mention the affect on our economy, that an incident like 9/11 has already caused. Everyone should read this book because the future is near and the extinction of the European/American race is around the corner. Dropping birth rates of couples from European descent coupled with the population explosion of third world countries hording into Europe and America is a disaster waiting to happen. This book isn't about being a racist or a biggot as some would have you believe it's just a thought provoking anaylsis of the facts. Ever try to enter into Saudi Arabia illegally and get free health care and a drivers license. How about Libya, Iran, India, China, or Korea. The only free health care you'll see is from inside a jail cell for a long time. I don't think anyone in Europe or America would advocate throwing these unfortunates in jail, but any leveled headed American would favor returning these people to their own country and to carry out our constitutionally mandated responsiblity of protecting our borders from foreign invaders. I'm not suggesting any sort of right wing civil rights violating tactics but at the very least lets adopt a policy of say Norway when it comes to immigration. I hope you buy and enjoy this book, read it with an open mind and for our liberal friends please demonstrate a little tolerance and diversity when encountering ideas that may differ from your own.

Through a comedy of intelligence errors, the USS Indianoplis was sunk and then left un-noticed for 4 days when only by chance a sub-hunter crew spotted an oil slick in the ocean and then flew down to investigate, only to find what was left of the crew. Through heroic efforts on the part of this air crew and others involved in the search and rescue operations did these men survive. Had it not been for the sub-hunter pilot, the ship and crew would have perished with out a trace. The survivors endured vicious unrelenting shark attacks, burns, broken bones, exposure, dehydration, starvation, hypothermia, the torpedoing and sinking of their ship, and worst of all the abdonment of them by the NAVY they fought for. The Navy then prosecuted the captain in order to cover their own negligence. I would recommend this book to anybody who would like to read what true men are really made of.

While it is most likely  historically accurate I found this subject extremely dry. Parts were very  intersting but I was expecting more about how the Irish and Chinese  actually built the railroad. If you're into trains this book is for you;  However, it took me longer to read this book than it took to build the  railroad. Sorry Mr. Ambrose I'm a total fan but this just didn't work for  me.	2000-09-18

Certainly more detail could have been provided relating to  the relationship between Jason Gridley and Jana, The Red Flower of Zoram.  In any case it was a fun adventure and I'd highly recommend this novel.	1998-12-03

I've become very disappointed with todays papermill of novel with the same old bland plot written to sell so I've returned to classics such as Tarzan which I've  never read before now. I sure wish I had read this as a kid. Great stuff.  I've passed them on to my young nephew. A good plot with a James Bond style  adventure.	1998-11-29

Why did this top secret, elite, counter terrorist combat team have to rely on a civilian British Airline to transport them to  their terrorist  targets. The ebola aerosol plot sounded really familier to me to. But it  was fun to read in any case. Maybe in his next book he could have a  president who's caught in a sex triangle in the oval office launch a cruise  missile attack on an aspirin factory in Sudan!	1998-11-06

What I found most interesting about this book in addition to the fact that it gave a completely different ending to the Civil War, was how the author was able to really personalize the characters such as Robert Lee and Bedford Forest from historical figures to people whom we could identify with on a more personal level. This in itself made this book fun to read. I highly recommend it to anyone	1998-07-07

John Brown's religious convictions as well as his belief in the constitution enflamed his desire to fight the tyranny of slavery and as a result could be considered the catalyst for the Civil War. This book was well written yet easy to read. If you have read this book or have an interest in this subject I would also recommend the book &quot;Cloud Splitter&quot;	1998-03-23

Ambrose really brings history to life in this book about Custer, Crazy Horse, and the culture of plains indians and American expansionism. Ambrose is able to elquantly put down on to paper both sides of the story without becoming bogged down in what is so popularly reffered to as politically correct revisionist history. After reading this book I really feel as though I have a much better understanding of both the indian side of the story which is to preserve their way of life as well as the unstoppable expansion into the west. Anyway no matter who's side you take Custer's or Crazy Horse's it's a great book and was fun to read.	1997-12-29

Apparently gone are the days of &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Carrie&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot;, and &quot;Pet Cemetary&quot;. I did enjoy the first few chapters but then it just bottomed out. One of two Stephen King books I put down as a waste of time. The other one was &quot;The Regulators&quot;. My advice Mr. King is to take a vacation, put away your laptop, dust off the Royal typewriter, and give us some of that vintage King we all know you still have in you.	1997-12-18
