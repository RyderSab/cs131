Perhaps a bit more darker than the previous two, and very much less romance.  Someone was always falling in love in Atwater-Rhodes other two books.  In this one, we are transported about 20 years in the future to the son of the two Falcon warriors.  He's miserable and loney and when one day he nearly dies by crashing from the sky, he discovers he must go to the falcon kingdom (basically the enemies of his parents) to be tutored.  I don't want to say more, since Atwater-Rhodes books are so short and concise.  I would hate to give away the story.<br /><br />Of course I'm suggesting that you read it.  It is obvious at the end of this one she plans to continue on.  I'm looking forward to reading more of this strange world.	2005-10-13

You discover in this book that everything that has happened thus far in every book is by the whim of the Seelie Queen.<br /><br />Cian is probably my favorite (beside Black of course) so far.  He's very manly-man (in a caveman sort of way).  I kept waiting for him to hit the Jessie over the head and drag her by her hair back to his cave.  There were a few parts that made me laugh.  The famale character is practically a carbon copy of every other one that has come before (which is a common problem in all of Moning's books).  Although she did try to changer her a little by making her look smart and slutty.  What confused me was how she kept saying how \\"horney\\" she was in the beginning of the book and then near the middle (like all the other characters) we discover she is a virgin.  So . . . why was she horney?  Usually you have to actually try something before you can miss it.  Oh well, whatever.  Weird thing is I'll probably keep reading them just to see what will happen with the queen and if Black will show up again.	2005-10-13

I didn't read the other reviews which explain that it was orginially published together as a part 1 and 2, so I had to wait for the second and then review the first to remember where it left off.<br /><br />It is an epic fantasy and is well written.  Although I wouldn't put it in the same category or standard as someone like Martin, but still very enjoyable to read.  The plot is tamer and nicer.  It reminds me of something of a romance in that romances always have happy endings and nothing bad ever happens to the good guys.  So you know you won't be diappointed as your reading, you know what to expect from a romance.  Unfortunately, that is the very reason why I don't like to read romances--it's just not realistic.  Bad things do happen in real life, even to the good guys.  It is also why I gave this four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Basically, the story is about a nine year old girl, whose father dies in battle and her half brothers sees this as his opprotunity to claim the throne for himself.  She ends up going into hiding and for the next eight years moves from place to place throughout the entire kingdom and beyond.  Waiting until she is old enough to reclaim the throne.  The story shows how she grows and matures through these years.	2005-10-13

Upon Leigh's arrival in a small town, where she will show Jessie the ropes, she encounters a werewolf.  She tracks the creature through the woods, shoots, and burns the body.  During the fire she is surprised by a strange half-naked, beautiful man (I know--an obvious copy from the first book; she even mentions the top button of his jeans being undone--also from the first book).  The guy is Damien and he is obviously involved in the strange occurances of this town.  Of course, Leigh and Damien are drawn to each other and things become steamy.  Read the book if you want to know more.<br /><br />I gave it only four stars because Leigh's character drove me batty.  She too hard nose and tough.

Only this cop seems to have little to no hold backs.  There's no one to tell her she can't do anything, including out right killing anyone she believes to be the suspect.  (This concept dropped one star for me).  Mia specializes in alien murderers.  So she basically goes out, finds the killer, and then kills them.  Only this case is driving her batty, because her suspect has a sexy alien brother who basically wants to f*** her.  (author's words, not mine)So he kidnaps her and shows her who the true killer is.  After that, she basically just has to neutralize the killer.  The other problem with this story is Mia is too tough.  She's rude.  Aggressive.  Mean.  Hateful.  Has little to no morals.  I just don't like her, and when you find nothing you can relate to a main character to, or the main character is totally obnoxious, like this one, you find yourself rooting against her instead of for. (That dropped the second star)  This was a book I could have done without reading.	2005-10-03

There is not really in romance (for those out there looking for a paranormal romance--you won't be interested) in this one.  It's mostly about a macanic, named Joanne (or Jonie or Jo).  Joanne is coming home via plane from her mother's funeral when she sees, from the air, a woman being attacted.  When the plane lands she grabs a cabbie (enter Gary--the cabby who become emersed in the story from here on).

Tristin is from another planet in another galaxy and has earned the unwanted attention of a Druinn (a being with magical powers).  Perhaps I shouldn't say it was unwanted--after all it does take two to make bed partners (suffice it to say she wanted more from the relationship).  When Tristin refuses to be her mate she betwitches him to a life as a pleasure slave trapped in a jewelry box.<br /><br />Meanwhile, on earth, Julie is shopping for antiques for her antique store when she come across an old jewelry box.  Something tells her she must have it and after haggling (unsuccesffully) for the price, she purchases Tristin's box.  When she opens the clasp when she gets home she is shocked to find a very attractive half naked man in her kitchen.  After threatening karate she tells him she wants him gone.  So he disappears--she thinks she is loosing her mind.  Anyway, the story goes on.  Julie ask Tristin to teach her how to suduce her neighbor, but Tristin has other things in mind.<br /><br />Very cute story.  A nice little get-away.  My only fault with this story is that I read another with the same premise that was done so much better.

What's up with these sisters?  She kept hinting and hinting, but it was not well written, so the reader was not anticipating anything, just annoyed because the author was being thoughtless.<br /><br />Apparently, this story is about the third (it took me until page 100 before I even found out she was the third sister and what her power was) sister of seven whose power is making people tell the truth.  Because of it she is ostrisized by practicaly the whole town.  So she travels alot studing dolphins.

The king has sent out a few of his most trusted to guage the temperment of his kingdom.  The person to lead the small band is Senneth (a mystic with astonding abilities).

The dead, Farold, was never a friend of Selwyn. As a matter of fact, the two boys were both vying for the hand of the same pretty girl.  (She chose Farold.)  But when a strange witch shows up inside the dark cave and shows Selwyn the way out (after agreeing to payment), Selwyn finds himself with a chance to find the real killer (with the help of the witch and the dead Farold).<br /><br />Wittily told.

She definately did not leave me disappointed.<br /><br />A Taste of Crimson is actually the second novel in the Crimson City series.  Apparently several different authors were hired to write for this series and each are putting out a different book.  I normally do not care for this, because authors can be notorious for not getting their facts (worlds, characters, etc.) straight.  Luckily, A Taste... does not revert back to characters that were developed by a different author.  Also, the Los Angelos (Crimson City) stayed faithfully the same as in the first book.<br /><br />For those of you who are more into the romance part of the paranomal romance, you will be more pleased with Liu's version.  She pulls more from that genre.  Yet, she is still strong in action and mystery.  The crimson world she creates, which centers mostly around the werewolves in this addition to the series, is rich and intriguing.  I read it in one sitting and am looking forward to trying more from this series.  Hopefully, the other authors will not diappoint.	2005-09-06

You wouldn't think you could become involve in such a novel.  You wouldn't think you could picture a such a man attractive, yet, you do.<br /><br />In this strange world, based in a time period similar to the 19th century, men are EXTREMELY rare.  Whole groups of sisters that can number as many as 10 to 30 women will share a husband in order to have offspring.  The results would be another huge brode of girl siblings, with the hopes of perhaps one boy (more than that and the family was considered lucky and rich).  The women guard there men by keeping them hidden away from any other woman not a sister or mother under guard.  Meanwhile, the women are the ones who rule, work, fight, and labor.<br /><br />Jerin Whistler's family is one of the lucky ones.

He and his brothers are their only chance of purchasing their own husbands to share in the future.  Because the wealth of four brothers, they will be able to split the sisters in two to three groups.  Each group sharing one husband they will get after selling or trading a brother for.

Seylin knows he is not the only one who is after Emily's hand in marrage and when he suggested for her to marry the other in the heat of a fight, she readily agrees.

It wasn't difficult.  All the books were \\"easy reads--fluff books.\\"  Which can be enjoyable in their own right.  Perhaps because I read them all at once made me not enjoy them as much.  I noticed while reading that every book had the same basic principle.  Time travel, fall in love, someone jealous want't to kill the girl, day is saved, the end.  It got to the point I was getting confused between what, or who, was in which book.  Most of the girls were also similar in looks and just alike in personality.  The men were all the same, too--brawny, tall, black hair, and massively in love and faithful.  All the girls were virgins.

I can't believe I have never heard of this book before, especially after noticing it already has well over 1000 reviews.  I thought it wonderful!  It's fantasy, of course, in a separate world with possible creatures (the people don't believe in them, but the reader is introduced to them early in the story) and court intrigue.  I like the fact that Martin switches chapters between most members of a family and two possible enemies, who really aren't enemies yet, but they don't know that.  I've read another book recently who did the same, but they had soooo many characters they would switch between, but soooo much time lapsed between, it fairly ruined the story.  That definitely did not happen in this one.  Martin did a supurb job of keeping the action flowing and still helping the reader stay in-tuned with the characters.<br /><br />The book is filled with romance, war, court intrigue, and a lot of betrayal.

How can a guy who came so close to receiving his MA be so gullible, air-headish, and stupid?  Or an up and coming FBI agent so easily believe a total stranger even when ALL the facts say something different?  This can't possibly be Patterson's writing.

It is actually two novellas.  The first by Howell tells of a vampire keep lord that wants to water down his vampire blood by taking a mortal wife.  The \\"vampire\\" aspect is not very primary in either tales, but Howell explains more in her part than Sands does.  Apparently, in Howell's part, they really don't need to drink blood at all, even less so when they are only part vampire.  With the exception of when they are hurt or near death.  Cathell pretty much finds his bride when she is literarly deposited before him in his bed by one of his men.  Then and there he decides she will be his wife and over the next few weeks \\"woos\\" her by capturing her in very heated embraces every chance he gets.  Only Bridget is not everything she seems.<br /><br />In the second novella by Sands, the vampire aspect is a bit different, since the vampires have to feed.  I don't think this was meant to happen since Cathell and Connell are cousins and are blood realted.  Perhaps Howell and Sands should have got their basic facts straight before writing the novellas.  Anyway, Connell is not as luckly in finding a mortal bride as Cathell is.  He actually has to send six men out to buy one from her miserly brother.  Eva is brought to the keep and spends several days without even seeing her husband.  Apparently Connell is a bit more shy than Cathell.  Meanwhile, while trying to prove her worth, Eva gets into several accidents.  They finally start to meet with each other over a chess game and Eva proclaims to her husband, let's just get \\"it\\" over with.  Well, that definitely breaks the ice!  Of course, there is problem to over come in this book too, since someone is trying to kill Connell.<br /><br />I enjoyed both.  I've read other Sands' books, and after this, I think I will look into more from Howell, since after comparing the two, she sounds like the more adept writer.	2005-07-27
US	39663319	R35RDJFOFNT4FV	0670059242	446017732	The Blue Girl	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Interesting piece of work	First off, I want to point out that I would not recommend this book to a young reader.  I don't think they would \\"get it.\\"  Even a young teenager.  I think it would require someone with a bit of maturity to grasp the depth of the book.  I also would not recommend it to anyone who does not read and enjoy fantasy, because I don't think they would \\"get it,\\" either.  Sorry if that offends anyone.<br /><br />For all those others out there, I think you would enjoy this book.  DeLint uses a first person format switching between Imogine, Maxine, and Adrian (Ghost).  You get the impression that Imogine is the focus character in that, well, everything and everyone focuses around her.  Imogine is a new student at her school.  She purposely befriends an outcast of her school, named Maxine.  This high school is like many schools in that everyone has a clique.  However, it is also different in that the bullies at this school are abnormally more agressive than you could imagine.  This is not important, though, it is simply a side story to the story.  The main part of the story is about Imogine discovering Ghost.  A boy who committed \\"suicide\\" at the school in '98.  Imogine makes it her mission to discover why this Ghost seems to be following her around.  When she does, even stranger things begin to happen.<br /><br />It was a good book, I finished it within two night because I was anxious to see how the problem would be solved.  I'm definitely reading more from De Lint.	2005-07-22
US	39663319	R2NZH9GG0LCQ9P	0061057053	97388485	The Changeling Prince	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Pretty good	After only just discovering VVV recently, I've been working through her books.  I find her to be an excellent writer with highly effective characterization.  This book is no exception.  The character of Weiland draws the reader's compassion.  Especially after discovering how he was capture as a wolf pup and basically turned into a human and abused and tortured consistantly throughout his life.  The author does not let the reader discover much about the interworkings of the evil Daria.  We only know that she is evil and would not shy away from brutally and viciously murdering anyone (even her own family).<br /><br />You can guess early on in the story (well, those older can) the truth about Weiland, although I was surprised in the end by something I had not even considered.  (Of course, I won't spoil it).  Overall, I think you will enjoy it, but I don't think it was as well written as some of her other works.	2005-07-22

Rees' details of the pirate life and this time frame in history is amazing to say the least.  I was engrossed through the entire book and read it within two nights.  It is a story based during the time of slavery that begins in England.  Nancy's father (owner of several ships and in debt) dies.  Her brothers basically sell her off to the top bidder in order to secure their own finacial security.  She is shipped off to the Americas to a sugar plantation her father owns.  When she finally does realize the extent of her peril (since her brother's don't bother to clue her in on anything) she runs away.  Minerva is a slave girl, same age as Nancy, on the sugar plantation.  Nancy befriends her regardless of the warnings from her brother and Minerva's mother.  When Nancy arrives unexpectically home one night and finds one of her hired hands attempting to rape Minerva, she shoots him and she and Minerva run away together.  Of course, you can tell by the title, they eventually become pirates.  I know it sounds like I said too much, but there is so much more going on in this story.<br /><br />I found it well written and engrossing.  And I think you will too.	2005-07-21

At the time I worked at a library and thought, \\"Why not.\\"  After, I recommended the books to young and old alike and received nothing but thanks in return.  In the sixth year at Hogwarts, the reader will find Harry, much more grown up.<br /><br />Harry is now sixteen and has been devastated with the lost of his godfather from the previous year.  Regardless, he trugs on.  Afterall, he still has his friends (Ron and Hermonie), Hagrid, and Dumbledoor.  Book six begins with Dumbledoor collecting Harry over the summer (quite strange--to say the least).  Dumbledoor tells Harry of his inheritance from his godfather and that he would like to give Harry private lessons in addition to his normal classes at Hogwarts.  Harry, of course, agrees.<br /><br />This year is especially dangerous for all witches and wizards everywhere, because now it is known by all that Voldermort has return with his Death Eaters.  While Death Eaters create a rampange throughout the countryside, Harry overhears Malfoy's secret converstations with a curator well known for dabbling in the dark arts.  Harry is certain that Malfoy is now a Death Eater like his father.  Only no one will take him seriously.  The story continues in this vein.  Harry helping and discovering Dumbledoor's secrets, following and spying on Malfoy, and then there is the teenage romance that seems to involve Harry, as well as, all his friends.<br /><br />I thought Rowling did a wonderful job with this one.  Harry's character is definately evolving into a more confident and intelligent young man.  The ending was a shock.  I don't know if I will be able to stand waiting at least another year for the next one.  I hope it goes by fast!	2005-07-21

The reader finally gets to find out what happened to Mary so many years ago.  Only, Rees continues the story in such a unique fashion.  Her research abilities come into practice again as the Reader gets an insight on the life and habits of Native Americans during the time of the French and Indian War.<br /><br />Agnes is having strange dreams in which she sees her self as Mary, her apparent ancestor, after reading the book Witch Child. (How you like that?) She decides to email the author by using the web address found at the back of the book.  She comes into contact with Alison, who is doing the research on Mary and was one of the scientist who discovered the diary in an ancient quilt.  They get together to join their talents.  Through Agnes' eyes, the reader gets to relive the days of Mary's escape, rescue, hardships, and life with her Indian family.<br /><br />Wonderful read.  I'm anxious to find out whatelse Rees has up her sleeve.	2005-07-21

Yet, I have never read one quite as well put together as this one.  I've read one other book by Rees', called Pirates!, and was fascinated with Rees' research ability of a certain time period.  In Witch Child, I found the same thing.  Rees' did a wonderful job of capturing the Puritains of this time period, as well as, hardships and trials upon a ship crossing to America.<br /><br />Witch Child is definately a fantasy, but the fantasy part is not so much \\"in your face.\\"  It is much more subtle.  The main character escapes on a ship headed to America.  She befriends an older lady who is also on her own.  Upon arrival they travel through the wilderness to join the group of family members that arrived the year before.  I would hate to give the story away so I won't say more about it.  I loved the ending, though.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2005-07-21
US	39663319	R26H1F02VV5OLL	0142400777	406847088	Wolf Moon	Books	5	2	2	N	N	I liked it	I've never read a book by De Lint, so, unlike other reviewers, I'm not bias because of reading his later works.  This one is a normal run of the mill fantasy, based in a far off land and a far off time.  It is my understanding that De Lint normally writes urban fatansy, so this obviously is a difference.<br /><br />What I like about it is the fact that it is not some epic fantasy.  He doesn't go on and on about the world and how what the hero does or accomplishes will save man kind or beast kind, or whatever.  This is simply a man, with a certain gift--or curse (depending on how you look at it) who simply want's to find his place in life.  He's unhappy and lonely.  By shear chance he is taken in by a family made up of friends and welcomed as their own.  He even finds a love.  But these friends may not last forever, because they don't know his deepest secret--that he is a werewolf.  Unfortunately, someone comes to the village that does, a hunter, and the hero (said werewolf) has to make a decision.  To run or stay and fight for what he has found.<br /><br />I found De Lint's writing poetic at times and well put together.  He said much, with only a few words and his character development was flawless.	2005-07-18

There were sooo many characters and sometimes you would have to wait through five to six chapters before Hob would return to that character so that you could find out what happened.  This would normally not bother me in the least, but I never was able to form an attachment to any one character.  I simply could not relate and because of that I simply could not enjoy the book as much.  Granted the story itself was excellent and the world was well thought out.  I think if Hobb would have focused on fewer charactesr and attempted to developed them more, I would have enjoyed it more.<br /><br />I finished this book, realizing in the end that nothing was solved and I would have to read through two more oversized ones before I would ever find out.  I ended up only scanning through the next one and returning them to the library.  Sorry, Amazon, but I am glad I did not bother to pay money for them.	2005-07-18

Throughout the entire book I giggled like a school girl on her first crush.  Between the wrestling gramdmas to the cake fight, it was hilarious.  Of course, Stephanie always looses a car, but how about three?  Then there is Morelli--Mr. Happy had to lock himself in another room to get some rest!  And Ranger having to scrable video to keep his worker's minds on their job and not Stephanie's top.  Whew!  I'm giggling again just thinking about it.  Of course there is a crime to solve--apparently four men left their jobs one afternoon to never return and some crazy person from Stephanie's past is leaving treatening notes and car bombs to scare her.  Granted, this is nothing new for Stephanie and she doesn't even take it as seriously as she would have, say in about book five or six, but it is enough to make her go snooping to find out who it is.<br /><br />Most intersting of all is the fact that the story begins with Stephanie quiting her job and turning her job position over to Lula (I'm sure you can imagine the possibilities there).  Therefore she spends her time throughout the story going from one dead-end job to another until she finally finds more \\"stable\\" employment working for Ranger (again--the possiblities!)  I know it sounds like I'm giving it all away, but trust me, there is soooo much more.  Okay, enough with me, stop reading it and go out and buy that book!	2005-07-18

Kenyon faithfully provides steamy sex scenes and hunky men.  This one had a bit of a twist on her \\"normal\\" paranormal romances.  First off, the Dark Hunter is a woman (\\"Danger\\") and the hunky male is, well, Other (\\"Alexion\\").  Hey, I'll even give you a clue, Alexion is not a name, but a job title.  Apparently, a revolt is happening among Dark Hunters in Mississippi and the Alexion is called in to either straighten them out or eliminate the whole lot of them.  Only he had no idea just how difficult it would be to keep his mind on his job, especially when he meets Danger.<br /><br />The reason why I gave it four stars instead of five was because it did not keep me hanging on the edge of my seat.  Yet, I still wiped it out in just two nights.  I think for those Dark Hunter fans out there, it would definitely be worth your time.  Those of you who have not read any from the series.  DO NOT begin with this one, you will only be completely baffled by what is going on.  This is not a stand alone novel.  Either way, happy reading!	2005-07-17

I found it graffic in every sense of the word.  The weird part was that I was more offended by the blashamy than about the homosexual acts.  The main character is pitiful and the real fiend of the book, his lover--David, is deplorable.<br /><br />So why four stars?  The writing itself was excellent.  You don't have to have a happy, happy book with nice characters to have a good book.  I just couldn't stop reading.  I wondered throughout what could they possibly do next.  I'll definately try another by this author.	2005-07-06

You don't want the story to end.  You want to continue reading and learning more about the character and what they will do next.<br /><br />What is amazing is the way she can pact so much information and feelings about the character in so few words.  That requires talent.  In Dragon's Bait we are brought into the time of the witch trials.  Alys is accused of being a witch for no other reason than the greed of her next door neighbor who covets her father's shop.  In short time, the witch finder is called, a trail commenses and she is convicted by the same people she grew up with for fifteen years.<br /><br />Here's the twist, instead of the usual burning, hanging, or drowning, she is tied to a steak in dragon country and left to be eaten.  Oh, the dragon definitely arrives, but he is more than she, or even he, imagined.<br /><br />I've only read a handful of VVV's novels.  I've been making my way through them over the last few weeks.

I was slightly disappointed with the second in this series, since Rachel was a shown just too dim-witted, BUT this one has turned out to be the best out of three.<br /><br />Rachel is still a bit goofy, but is portrayed more devoted to her relationships and honest.  Which is weird, because she get's in a huge fight with Jenks for her not being completely honest with him.  I would hate to spoil everything that happens in the story like a few other reviewers do.  I'll only give you the basic jest of it.  After encountering several possible employees and friends with problems with a new bad lord come to town, Rachel is pulled in to stop the bad guy.  Stanley want's to take up Piscary's old stumping ground, and believe it or not, he's worse than Piscary.<br /><br />New characters are introduced--a new elf and werewolf. Old ones returned--soooo glad to see Kisten again (in my imagination of course).  Ivy is put in a more humane light and we even get to meet her family.  Al is back and way evil.  Then, to top it all off--a demon--that even Al is afraid of.<br /><br />I stayed up to three in the morning because I could not put this one down.  The action was nonstop and fabulous. I don't just mean the fighting and running for your life, but it was a little racey, too. And yet, even though problems were solved, Harrison left a few strings hanging, so you know this is not the last you've seen of the Hallows.  I can't wait for the next one.	2005-07-04

Everything else gets put on hold while I read it.  This is obviously an old series and I picked up all three at once.  I'm a fast reader, but I took my time reading this because it was so well written and I was afraid to miss the least thing mentioned.  It took me a week to read the first and a week to read this one.  I'm not picking up the third one until I get some personal things taken care of first.  You truly fall into the lives of these characters.  I can't tell you how often I shed tears for Fritz.  What a tragic life he leads, and yet he goes on.  He has loyal friends who love him, but it's like everyone's hands are tied. It's either sink or swim, and they are definately swimming with sharks.<br /><br />Fritz does have a little bit of happiness in this novel.  He gets to spend time with Molly, his love. But even that becomes heartache when he realizes Molly is receiving visits from Regal.  I don't want to explain everything that is happening in this series, it is just too numerous to mention.  I can promise that this series is a great adventure, one not to miss.	2005-06-05

Hamiltion's Anita series.  Roles have now reversed.  I'm reading Anita series as filler between the Sookie's series.  This series is just wonderful.  I love it.  The last novel had some really steamy sex scenes between Sookie and Eric, which was fun.  I was worried that Harris was turning in the same direction that Hamiltion has unfortuantely turned.  All sex, and no plot.  Dead as a Doornail was a relief.  So be honest, there was not a single sex scene in the entire book--only plot.  Not to say the book wasn't \\"romantic\\", Sookie definately has several romanic interest.  Or at least there are several paranormal creatures that are interested in Sookie, only she's not ready for that sort of thing.  I love the fact that Harris keeps Sookie true to her personality.  You can't forget that Bill was her first love, her first sexual partner and Eric only her second.  She's not some cheap fluzzy that jumps from bed parter to bed partner (Something that has become prevalent in the Anita books).<br /><br />If you read the book's excerpt, it leads you to believe the book is primarily about the panthier colony and Jason.  Not so.  The book begins with Jason going through his first transformation and embracing it.  Good for him.  The book really centers around a serial killer.  A sharp shooter that is targeting shapeshifters.  Of course, the cops have no idea what the connection between the three victims, but those in the paranormal world do.  When Sam is the third one shot, they have to find a replacement bartender.  Sookie turns to Eric as a favor to Sam and ask if he could lone one to the bar.<br /><br />Here's what's going on with the men in Sookie's life:  Eric is still going crazy wondering what happened during the time he spent at her house.  Bill is moving on--seeing someone new.  Sam is still attracted to Sookie, while she is still denying it.  Alcide shows up to ask a favor.  Calvin still want's her as a wife.  She holds all these guys at arm length, explaining to each she doesn't want to get involve.  None seem to take her seriously.<br /><br />Something else I like about Sookie over Anita is that not every man likes or wants her.  Andy still hates her.  Claude can care less, etc.  It makes her more realistic.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next, I hope it won't be another year.She holds all these guys at arm length, explaining to each she doesn't want to get involve.

I've read some of Atwater-Rhodes latest novels and found them wonderfully in-depth, so of course I was fasinated to read her first ever.  All I can guess is the reason this book is so acclaimed is because she wrote it when she was only thirteen.  As a matter fact, this fact is stated in the bio, as well as the back cover of the book.  (Like it is the selling point of the book--which it is.)<br /><br />I found it lacking the emotion found in her book characters she is so well known for in later novels.  I'm guessing  because thirteen year olds don't have the life experence to know what passion is?  I don't mean romantic passion, but just passion in general.  The concept of the story was interesting and she did a fairly good job of flashbacks.<br /><br />The story is about Risika, who was unwillingly transformed into a vampire three hundred years previously.  In the present she is basically picking for a fight with another vampire who is suppose to be stronger than her just for the hell of picking on him.  He keeps warning her away, she keeps disreguarding the warnings until she faces him down.  I can't really say more or I'll be telling the entire story--it's extremely short.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to her latest novels.	2005-06-05

Edge personifies that bad-boy, take-it-or-leave-it attitude. Very sexy. Edge wasn't always bad.  When he was newly formed he was the leader of a gang of abandoned newly-formed vampires, mostly kids (one was transformed at only 12).  They all turn to Edge for guidance.  One night, one of the gang does not return, so Edge goes out to find him.  When he returns empty handed, it is to find all the fledglings brutally murdered.  He cuts down the bodies, cleans them, and burns their home.  Then pledges to revenge his love ones no matter what, no matter how ruthless he has to become.<br /><br />The person he hunts is Stiles.  He had already captured him twice before and killed him, only to watch Stiles walk away from death.  Obviously Stiles has found a way to beat death.  After treateningly questioning several of Stiles old co-workers, assistances, etc., he discovers that Amber Lily is the key.  Stiles obviously found a way to eternal life after experiments done on Amber Lily.  Therefore, if he finds a way to destroy Amber Lily, then he will have a way to destroy Stiles.<br /><br />Of course, he wasn't expecting her to be so innocent or attractive.	2005-06-05

Just so happenily the first time I read a Shayne novel was a much more recent edition, so I know she gets even better (thus the four stars instead of five).<br /><br />The best part of the book is the flashbacks.  I like the story being told about Dante, being seduced into the world of vampires by his great-great-great aunt, Sarafina.  Then Sarafina tries to twist his mind in how she believes a true vampire should act.<br /><br />In the present world, Morgan, is living in an old mansion that once belonged to Dante. She finds journals that describe his experences and plagerizes them by turning them into movie scripts under her own names.  Anyway, one thing leads to another and they eventually meet.  It's hard to like Morgan when she steals someone elses work.<br /><br />On the side is Max and Lou.  Max comes into proof that vampires really exist.  Lou is a cop, nearing retirement.  Max wants to get into private investigation. Lou turns to her for help with what is apparently a paranormal investigation. This investigation brings her into contact with Morgan and Dante.<br /><br />I like the subplots of this book as well as having a \\"bad\\" guy.

The thought of having a best-seller at the tender age of 13 is mind-bongling.  Her books only take me a few hours to read, which means they are fairly short, yet with so few words she can bring the reader to smoothly and easily into the life of this fictional character.  I can understand how the main character feels, why she is thinking the way she thinks.  Even the bad guys are made crystal clear.  I'm definitely planning to work my way through all her writing.<br /><br />In shattered mirror, Sarah is a witch, and a trained vampire hunter at seventeen.  As a matter fact, her mother is the most famous, and feared, hunter of her time, and she comes from a famous line of vampire hunters.  She was trained mercilessly since an extremely young age on how to kill these \\"leeches\\" with as little emotion as possible.  After all, they are all just creatures preying on the human race.  Sarah has to attend a new school after being kicked out of the last one for fighting.  On her first day she meets and befriends a sister and brother, both vampires.  She can tell they are weak and not prone to feeding on the human race, but that doesn't change the fact that they are leeches, none the less.  She tries to break off the friendship, but they are just so nice, so good, it makes it hard to turn away.  Besides Christopher is so sweet.  He leaves her the most beautiful sketches of herself and poetry in her locker and books and, well, how could she kill someone she likes?<br /><br />If your not sure wheather or not you should give this one a try, trust me, you won't regret it.<br /><br />Happy reading!	2005-05-26

It is impossible to put down.  Rachel Caine has actually improved in her writing through each book.<br /><br />The story begins with Joanne and David trying to get to Vegas.  Apparently Jonathan and Kevin had been successful in keeping them out of the city limits for a couple of months.  The stress and tension is getting to Joanne and David is obviously concerned for her well-being but realizes nothing will stop her, so he does his best to protect her in the only way he knows how.  Although, the reader, as well as Joanne, doesn't know just how until much later in the book.  Caine also unwraps a scene from Joanne's past that definitely had an effect on her personality as well as the rest of the world.  Of course Joanne makes it into Vegas, only to be shocked by the fact that Jonathan doesn't want to be rescued and to be kidnapped by a new magical entity she, and the rest of the wardens, did not know exist.<br /><br />Caine lays the foundation of so many subtle problems and solutions that the reader can't help but continue to read on to discover them.  Her cliff hangers, something I found annoying in her previous books, are becoming more artisticly done.  I was lucky to begin reading this series only a week ago, but now that I've read all three, I'm stuck having to wait goodness knows how long for the next.  Oh, well.<br /><br />Happy Reading!	2005-05-26

Don't expect a major, life changing epiphany.  The girls are usually either large or disfigured and they always land the most handsome, sexy guy there, who always thinks the herione to be nothing but beautiful on sight regardless of the fact they dated and had been attracted to nothing but beautiful, perfect women before. (In my experience, that usually comes after they get to know your personality).  Then there is the plot, it is almost always over the top.<br /><br />What you can also expect from MacAlister's books is to laugh hysterically.  You just can't help it. You know the herione is being childish or selfish, but then there you go, your laughing out loud.  And that is why I keep reading her books.<br /><br />The Corset Diaries are writen in first person, diary format (of course) and follow the experience of the herione as she stars in a reality show in Britian.  She joins a family and staff as they live like a duke and dutchess from the past.  Like a true romance, love is fallen into and there is a happy ending.<br /><br />Happy reading!	2005-05-22

It is obvious his parents are not getting along.  One morning he witnesses his father coming out the spare bedroom instead of the room he normally shares with Henry's mother.  After a long talk with his father over breakfast at a local cafe, his father admits to him his mother is having an affair.  All Henry want's to do is escape.  He does while visiting old Mr. Forgarty.  Mr. Forgarty hired Henry to do some cleaning around his house, since he is too old to do it himself. Henry is a hard worker, but there are days Mr. Forgarty only wants to talk--about aliens, conspiracies, faeries, etc.  Henry knows the old man is batty, but believes him harmless and usually just humors him and his wild stories.<br /><br />But on the day of his father's revelation about his parents problems, he doesn't fill like talking and asked Mr. Forgarty if he could just get straight to work cleaning up the shed.  While cleaning the shed, Mr. Forgarty's old tomcat catches a butterfly in his mouth and attempts to eat it, but the butterfly fights back.  When Henry approaches to get a better look at the strange insect, he realizes it is not a butterfly at all but a small boy, his age, with wings.  A Faerie.<br /><br />Henry and Mr. Forgarty join together to help the faerie, a prince from an alternate world who enemies were trying to kill, and this brings them on a very exciting adventure.<br /><br />I thought it was a little slow in the beginning and the author flip flopped between setting and characters a little to often, causing confusion.  Also, the spelling of words were off. The author did not use the letter z at all.  Regardless, it was a good story and I'm looking forward to reading the second, The Purple Emperor.	2005-05-22

Then on a lazy afternoon I picked it up to read only to finish it the same night.<br /><br />The characters are not in-depth as I would like and all the flashbacks were a bit maddening, but the action just didn't stop.  I wanted to know what would happen next and I truly LIKED the main character.  She was sexy, confident, and smart.<br /><br />In Ill Wind, the world doesn't know about the unknown heroes, the weather wardens, that protect the people from mother earth.  Without the wardens, mother earth would have distroyed all known life long ago.  Joanne is one of these weather wardens who is on the run for her life.  The people she once worked with are trying to capture, and possibly even kill, her for killing her boss.  What they don't know is that she has a demon mark, which is even more leathal than her co-workers.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the next in this series.	2005-05-22

She thinks at first that everything will be alright, but when the head honcho, Jonathan, of the Djinn insist on seeing her and David, she realizes her mistake.  David had to give up a piece of himself to save her and now according to Jonathan, David will die unless Joanne learns to become a Djinn in her own right, or dies. But that's not all!  Strange blue lights are coming into the world. Only the Djinn sees it and apparently it is lethal to them.  It's up to Joanne and David to figure out what and stop it.  But that's not all!  Now that Joanne is a Djinn she runs the risk of being claimed.  And is, by a pimply face, hormonal teenage boy with a psycho step mother.<br /><br />What a great series.

I so enjoyed the first two.  The futuristic world created by Knight is entralling and even a bit scary.  This book did not follow through on either one of those emotions.<br /><br />Basically Valentine has spent a year on a secret mission as a Cat to secure a strong enough ship to obtain a secret weapon to fight the Kur.  Somehow the knowledge of this \\"secret weapon\\" had only landed in the revolutionaries laps recently.  The weapon is located in Haiti and Valintine doesn't even know what it is, only that the \\"contact\\" whom never saw him before in his life would recognize him and contact him.  Strange?  Well, it was.  This was only one of many loose strings throughout the story.<br /><br />What I missed most about Knights writing was the incredible development of characters and realtionships with these characters.  I didn't see any this time.  Valentine takes up a bit of a romance in Jamaca, but if I was suppose to feel sorry for him for having to move on, well, I really didn't even know this new character well enough to even care.<br /><br />Overall, I still enjoy this series and plan to continue reading them.  I'm hoping the next one, Valentine's Rising, will pick back up where the first two left off.<br /><br />Happy reading!	2005-05-17

I had no idea she actually developed that concept further with this book and Master of the Night.<br /><br />This one is my favorite so far.  It is about a young city clerk and part time policeman volunteer who just so happens to also be a werewolf.  Diana's race was created by Merlin as a fail-safe in case the the vampires and witches would become bad, since the werewolves were immune to magic.  No one knows they exist except Llyr, the king of the faries.  He was told by Merlin before he departed for other worlds in need.<br /><br />The werewolves on the other hand know all about faries, vampires, and witches.  (Others names for these entities are used in this book, but I choose these for those who are not familar with this topic).  Only, one of the bad vampires had come to Diana's town and is killing the local young men in a really horrible way.  Diana is determined to stop the strange creature.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the good guys living in the magical parallyl universe are setting out to stop the rogue, evil vampires when they come across the killing in Diana's town from a copy of the local newspaper.  Llyn recognizes Diana's face from an erotic dream he had about her the previous night and volunteers to set out for the the town and destroy the vampire.<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, I know it sounds corney, but you really have to give it a chance.  Knight's story is interesting, funny, and is hard to put down once she get started.<br /><br />Happy reading!	2005-05-17

It is extremely enjoyable and very fast pace.<br /><br />The story picks up not far after the first one, Naked in Death, left off.  Eve Dallas is still seeing Roarke.  It is getting to the point where she spends most of her nights at his place.  Sommerset still hates her.  At one point in the book, she gets into a tuffle with Summerset (they practactally wrestle).  It was funny.  Roarke hints there is a reason why he keeps Sommerset around, but doesn't elaborate in this book (perhaps future ones?)<br /><br />Eve is called in on a serious case by Commander Whitney.  One of the Commander's closest friends, and well respected public servant, is murdered.  Cicely Towers, the cities P. A., was found with her throat cut in a shady area of town.  The Commander pulled strings to have Eve on the case, since she is the best (of course).  It doesn't take long for him to regret it, when Eve begins questioning his wife and godchildren about the murder.  Feeney returns as partner (I think they were both excited about this) and Nadine (the new reporter) helps out on the case also, but this time it might mean her life.<br /><br />Through all this, Eve struggles in her relationship with Roarke.  Apparently he's in love with her, but she can't accept that nor can she admit her love for him.  So, he breaks it off.  Yep, you heard me.  You'll have to read to find out what Eve has to do to get him back.<br /><br />Happy reading!	2005-04-27

Annie is this fiery red-head.  She's short, smart, smart-mouthed, and has a temper that can make the almost strong man weep.  She happens to run a bed and breakfast that has been in her family for generations and she inherited from her grandmother (it just so happened to be a bordello in a previous life).  There are two, funny old ladies who are permanent residence and the psychic, formally introduced in a previous book as a visiting guest. (Of course she attracts the ghost) Then there is the handyman, a good for nothing drunk, which begins the story.  Why, because Annie has been hired by Jamie and Max to hold their wedding at her bed & breakfast, and the handyman is no where to be found.  When he does show up, Annie decides to teach him a lesson by chasing him around a tree, swinging at him with a rolling pin.  When a stranger arrives and tries to stop the ruckus, he gets beaned in the head with the rolling pen--twice!<br /><br />Of course the stranger is HOT and Annie feels terribly guilty.  He threatens to sue, she offers lunch and the help of the retired doctor next door.  Only the stranger doesn't know the retired doctor is retired from veternarian medicine and accidently gives him a horse tranq.<br /><br />Trust me, it only gets better.  Later in the story, Annie's husband's (the one she thought deserted her three years before) body turns up in her back yard and she is accused of the murder.  The good looking stranger turns out to be a P. I. hired by Annie's mother-in-law, and basically the whole world goes insane.  And just think, I only covered the first chapter or two!<br /><br />Happy reading!	2005-04-25

This one picks up right where the last left off.  R'Shiel is still very ill from the stabbing she received.  Tarja and Damin have moved their forces to the border to stop the encroaching forces sent by Xaphista.  But these are not the highlighted people or points in this story.  In Treason's Keep, Fallon turns to Adrina and Damin.  Adrina was only mentioned in the first as a Fardohnya Princess with a high spirit that her father, the king, could not pay people to marry.<br /><br />Well, apparently he found someone to marry her, the Karien prince, Cratyn.  At first, Adrina thinks this is going to be a piece of cake.  She even calls Craytn, Cringing Cretin.  Adrina is demanding, manipulative, and spoiled rotten.  Unfortately, after the nuptuals are finalized, she realized she was not the one doing the playing, but Craytn and the Kariens.  After being hit and threatened, she realized she is in a forgein country with only two people she can trust (her half brother and her maid).<br /><br />Other things going on at this time:  The Karien's take over the Sisters, when the priest are able to place a sane Joyhinia back in power (I won't spoil it by telling you how).  R'Shiel is taken prisoner, Adrina and her maid escape across the boarder and are captured by Tarja and Damin.  Damin is put in charged of Adrina (you can guess where that will go). Plus, so much, much, more.<br /><br />I think I enjoyed Medalon more, but this one was still able to hold its own quite well.	2005-04-25

Jane fights the intruder in the beginning, not to say she wasn't noticing just how sexy-gorgous he was.  Even when he restrains her and pats her down for weapons, she can't help but wet her panties and Baran, with his superior sensitive noise can't help notice.  Needless to say, they get down and heavy, several times.<br /><br />Enter, Drusas, a modern day Jack the Ripper (Oh wait, he's the real Jack the Ripper who has traveled through time) and he wants Jane--dead.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this one and am looking forward to reading more by Angela Knight.	2005-04-22

After all, after their mother left, Ian's ony mother figure around the house now was her.  Kerry sneaks off to the laundry mat (last seen place of the beloved animal) only to walk into the middle of what she thought to be a gang related scene.  Three men drag in a young man bloody and beaten and refuse to let Kerry leave until they know for certain she's not \\"one of them.\\"  Kerry soon realizes the men believe the young man, Ethan, to be vampire and she a possible one also.  Thinking the men insane, Kerry helps rescue Ethan.<br /><br />This is definately not the last Kerry sees of Ethan, though.  The next day, after school and her shift at the local supermarket, her father is late picking her up and no one answers at home.  Kerry happens to run into Ethan coming out of same supermarket and he offers her a ride home.  They discover her house ransacked and a red message waiting for her on her living room wall.  \\"Vampire:  We have your family\\"  Distraught, Kerry turns to Ethan for help even after discovering her mistake, because Ethan really is a vampire and know she doesn't know who to trust.<br /><br />Wow, huh?  This is only the beginning.  I must admit Velde had my mind swirling in doubt.  I had no clue who was the good guys and who was the bad guys thanks to her superb ability of creating such well developed and well-rounded characters.

Well, it's not, instead this one contains vampires and the witches who kill them.<br /><br />It was strange feeling a connection to the obvious \\"bad guys.\\"  The vampires are evil and they do kill to feed.  The witches are good and they risk their lives and family to stop them.  This is not a book about that fight.  The witches are more in the background, but leave an obvious impression.  There like a shadow that leaves the main characters more colorful and bright.  Jessica knows she is different.  Kids at school skitter away from her even as she approaches and she doesn't have the best relationship with her adoptive mother.  Her only release, her only freedom is the books she writes and her all black room is stacked with her manuscripts.  She is only 17 and, as of only two weeks ago, published her first novel about vampires.  Her second one is at the publishers right now.<br /><br />Alex is the new boy at school, but he has a secret.  He's not there for an education, but to kill the author publishing his history as the vampire, Aubrey.  He doesn't know how she knows all his intermost secrets, but she must die.  Only when he meets her face to face, he doesn't, and he doesn't even understands why.<br /><br />Caryn is also a new girl at school and she's there looking for Jessica, too.  But for a different reason than Aubrey.  Caryn is a witch and it is her life duty to protect Jessica, even if she doesn't want protection.<br /><br />Very well written book.

I think I might actually be insane.  Yet, here I am, still buying the books.  I had a huge problem with the last one because it was all sex and no plot.  Well, in Stroke of Midnight, she attempts to add somewhat of a plot:  A double homicide.  The reader practically becomes giddy with anticipation.  You think to yourself:  \\"Is the old Hamilton back?  Could it be?  Please, please let it be!\\"  Then you read the other 300 pages and realize, no, just the same old-same old.<br /><br />Some of the problems I had with this book included the endless stretch of a day and night.  For two books now I have been waiting to find out what will happen at the Seelie Court and the gnomes.  I'm beginning to feel I'll have to wait five more books to ever find out.  How utterly depressing and an efficient way to loose readers.<br /><br />I was also hoping that the solving of the crime (murders) would envolve Merry.  Instead she delegates and moves off to have more sex.<br /><br />Then there was the sex.  Sure it was steamy, but there were sex scenes that would last through four to five long chapters.  They would play then talk, kiss, then talk, fondle, then talk.  AUGH!  What made it worst was the talk was mostly self-pity, woe-is-me, I'm not worthy.  Booooorrring.  Most sex scenes were Merry with two to three guys and EVERY sex scene was with a host of other guards watching.  Even the one with Adair, who is supposedly sooooooo shy.  Merry, who is totted as being the prefect lover, basically tells him, either put out or she'll take another to bed.<br /><br />The wrap up at the end was the worst of all.  Your not even sure if the murder is solved.  The queen believes it, but who wouldn't admit to murder after being led around by their intestines?<br /><br />So, why am I giving it three stars?  Because the men sound sooo sexy.  God, I'm gullible!  I'll probably even read the next one.	2005-04-15

The new technology and moral beliefs of the public was basically plausible.  The protagonist, Eve, was realistic and well rounded.  I thought Riley was a bit flat.  He didn't show the tarnish of his stated upbringing, but perhaps future books will show this.  Just to give a base line, Eve is a detective, Riley is a suspect for multiple murders.  The murderer plans to kill a total of six legal prostitutes and is accomplishing it one per week.  It is up to Eve to catch the bad guy before he kills again.<br /><br />My only problem with this book was the ending.  I predicted it (including the bad guy) the moment he was introduced in the story.  Granted, I read alot, so it is easier for me to predict endings, but I still prefer to be surprised and look for that great author that keeps me guessing.  I didn't find it here, but I still found liked it and plan to read more.	2005-04-12

Then he shows her his wings, yikes!<br /><br />If you think this is the ordinary fluff romance where the guy gets the girl in bed and then they fall in love as they have numerous acts of sex, well sorry, not the case.  Jane and Charlie  have more problems than just the murder trial.  Apparently some magical force in Charlies parallel world is killing off life--plants, animals, even human.  The women are unable to babies and the kingdom is in a panic. Even more strange is the fact that everywhere Jane goes things happen (like opening walls, plants growing and mass conception);-)<br /><br />Then there is the man trying to kill her.  And oh, we can't forget Charlie, Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes.  Jane is determined to get him in bed and he is determined to stay as far away from her as possible.  Of course Jane does everything in her power to make that impossible.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is the ending.  It was just a little too nice.	2005-04-02

The first three short stories by Hamilton, Davidson, and Harris was a huge disappointment.  I have read ALL these ladies books.  There was nothing there to capture me.  The last two were a little longer and I found myself much more interested.<br /><br />Angela Knight wrote a short story intitled \\"Galahad\\" I thought was great.  It was a whole new world and concept on the grail.  I liked Vicki Taylor's short story, too.  A guy wants to become a vampire to get back at a vampire that took everything from him, even his fiance'.  I've never read anything from these two authors, so I'll definitely look into them.	2005-04-02

That was a few years ago.  I picked up The Dark Sleep two days ago and attempted reading it.  I made it to page 90.  I normally can finish a book in a day, sometimes two.  By the time I reached page 90 of this one I was asking myself \\"So what's the conflict?\\"  I found no major conflict in this story.  How can you have a story without conflict?  Perhaps something will come up later on, but I'm just too bored with it to read on and find out.  As far as I'm concerned, every great author knows you should introduce the problem early on to hook the reader.  I'm SO not hooked!<br /><br />Sorry, but I can't imagine myself ever returning to this series or author.	2005-03-30

Little do they know the Demon Child herself is studing to become a sister and is the dauther of the First Sister, nonetheless.  R'shiel and her half-brother, Tarja, are unhappy with their lives and having to live under the thumb of their demanding, over-bearing, and power-hungry mother.  Despite all that they manage to be their own person and defy her.<br /><br />Tarja soon discovers his pretty sister is not his sister at all but was stolen at birth by his mother for her own unknown reasons.  When they escape the wrath of their mother (after defying her) and hide as they travel on the road, they come across a band of rebels and discover there is much more going on with the sisterhood than they ever imagined, and that things were not always as they seem.<br /><br />Fallon keeps the action going, as well as deviling deep in her characters.  I had several surpises (which is not a common accurance for me).  I'm definately looking forward to the next in this series.	2005-03-28

After the Charnel Prince, I can't believe I will have to wait for the next one see what will happened.  Because now I feel like things can go in any direction.  How easy it would be for someone to die.  For a love interest to turn in another direction.  To discover your enemy was actually your friend.  Wow!<br /><br />I could't possibly explain all that is going to on this novel.  I will say the action continues.  The characters are still on a mission.  The author switches lead characters from chapter to chapter and almost every chapter is a cliff hanger.  That's the only thing that drove me crazy.  I always flip head to discover what happens and then flip back to continue where I left off.  Regardless, I am on the edge of my seat waiting for the third!	2005-03-22

I think her characterization is beyond comparison.  I'm not sure what happened in this novel.  The story starts off like usual.  Karon is off leading a fight.  Seri is at home trying to raise their son, Gerik.  Then suddenly, Karon want's to kill Gerik.  Gerik flees to a new world, the Bounded.  Which is a really interesting place.  Nearly 1/2 of the book is spent in this new world, with Gerik trying to solve its problems.  Eventually he leaves the Bounded to solve his family problems as well as the problems of the other two worlds.<br /><br />The only problems I had with this book is that the world of the Bounded and the actual bad guy in the end of the story was never introduced.  I don't understand how these people could just pop up out of no where.<br /><br />Would this stop me from reading any other books from Berg?  Of course not.  Berg is still a very talented writer and will always be on my number one list of reads.	2005-03-22

Not to mentioned I read it in one sitting on a Saturday afternoon.<br /><br />Derek is a werewolf going alfa.  What does that mean to the rest of the world.  Not a darn thing.  But it does mean that he is definitely not getting along with his best friend, Michael, who is the alfa of the pack.  To prevent strife and possible death, Derek is sent on a mission by the local werewolf psychic.  He must save the world by \\"taking care of\\" the reincarnated Morgan La Faye.  More than happy to leave, Derek takes off to \\"off\\" the girl.  Only Sara, the supposed bag girl, is not was he imagined.  First of all, she's cute.  Second of all, trying to kill her gives him an anurism (spelling?) LITERALLY!<br /><br />So instead the two go on a cross country search to find the real bad guys and save the world.  Sounds corney?  Of course it is, but it's also hilarous.  I loved the witty comments, the slapjack comedy (in my head of course), and the ditzy characters.  Derek is awfully sexy and lovable.  Sara is strong willied and funny.  This book is a great get away and will definately cheer up any sour mood.	2005-03-22

This book contains the first three of this series:  \\"Twilight Phantasies,\\" \\"Twilight Memories,\\" and Twilight Illusions.\\"  The first two I didn't like as much as the others I read.  They were too tamed and reminded me too much of Christine Freehan.  The vampires are so overly nice.  Also, the plot centers only around the romance.  The third, I found was much, much better. Probably because there was a mystery to solve and it was not all sex.  I think there was only two sex scenes in all.  I perfer the action to be enhanced by the romance, not the other way around.<br /><br />I'm definately reading more.  Considering my experience so far with this author, I'm hoping she only gets better.	2005-03-13

This is actually the first novel of her's I picked up.  Perhaps that's why I feel comfortable giving her five stars. It seems her old fans expect a certain format from Shayne and have give less stars because of it.<br /><br />Well, this novel is about a couple of paranormal sleuths who receive an urgent call from an old partner.  Jason says his sister is missing and he needs Max and Stormy to help find her.  Actually, it seems an old and powerful vampire, obsessed with his old blond haired petite love, came across a picture Stormy and was entralled with the likeness.  Therefore, he's using Jason by holding his sister and friend hostage until he can get Stormy and Max to his island mansion.  Sounds corney?  Actually, I found it very readable.  I liked the fact the old vampire had two sides. He holds an entire city in tralled, yet he chews out any of his minons if they harm a girl.<br /><br />The above is the sub-story. The real story in Blue Twilight is the one going on between Max and her love interest, Lou.  Max decides to pull all the guns and get Lou to admit his feelings for her.  It doesn't work, but something else does in the end.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to back tracking and seeing all that I missed in previous books.  It was weird having to read Shayne referring to previous novels and not have a clue what she was talking about.	2005-03-07

Something did not call to me about this book.  Yet, it continued to obtain more and more wonderful reviews, so I gave it a try.  Right off, I was hooked.  Not many authors are talented enough to switch setting and characters so smoothly as Keyes and not loose the readers train of thought.<br /><br />The reader immediately begins to ask themselves what is connecting all these different characters.  How does it relate to preface?  Like a spider weaving his web, Keyes draws them together.  Your held breathless wondering will this character survive?  Will they see the wrong-doings of this one?  Why must she be so selfish, doesn't she realize how she hurts others?  I simply cannot put into enough words all the emotions that will go through your mind and heart as you read this novel.  You truly become involve in this story.<br /><br />Hopefully, the wait will not be long for the next one!	2005-03-03

There were a few glitches that did not bode well with reality, but I shrugged it off.  After all, if I wanted to read a true to life book, I would have chosen a realistic fiction.<br /><br />The main character is very likable.

Spencer introduces Atticus Steele and friends in this latest novel following the trials and tribulations of Ukiah Oregon.<br /><br />Atticus and his partner discover Ukiah dead in a trunk of a car surrounded by mice.  Obviously something they have seen before.  Apparently, Atticus had more than his share of run-ins with death and mice.  Not to mentioned this \\"kid\\" looked exactly like him.  So, of course they decide to save him.<br /><br />I like the fact Spencer decides to add a new character and for much of the book, the story is told from Atticus' view point.  The reader also dicovers Atticus' love interest is different from Ukiah, also.  Which continues the homosexual theme that began with Ukiah's moms.  It also gives the Dog Warriors reason to leave another \\"breeder\\" alone.  The action is nonstop and the reader can't help but feel for these characters.  I really enjoyed all the books from this series.<br /><br />The reason I chose to give it four stars instead of the usual five is that I felt Spencer should have explained situations more fully.  For example, in this novel she shows the cult as trying to save mankind.  Yet, they know by know that the sex drug is lethal to humans (many of their own have died from it) and does absolutely nothing to the \\"demons.\\"  Still they continue to manufactor it and sell it the the people.  This completely goes against their agenda.  There were several other things I found that were a contradiction to the character's or group belief.<br /><br />Still, if you can overlook these things, I'm sure you will enjoy this novel.	2005-02-28

I am so use to authors losing their touch as they continue a series, but after reading Kiss of the Night (featuring the shapeshifters) and now this one, I'm practically on my edge of the seat waiting for the next.<br /><br />Kenyon managed to keep the action coming throughout the novel and the romance (mostly sex) followed as a second.  I'm so tired of reading paranormal romances that are almost all sex and no plot.  Kenyon is a refreshing alternative.<br /><br />In this enstallment, Tabatha, a real human vampire slayer, encounters Valerius, a Dark-Hunter, while defeating a band of Daimons.  During the fight she mistakes him for a Daimon and stabs him.  When he doesn't go up in a poof of smoke, she realizes her mistake and calls her friend Nick to help transport the Night Hunter to saftey.  Being an empath allows Tabatha to feel Valerius true emotions below his stuffy, condicending(spelling?) facade.  Valerius is taken aback by her outspoking, carefree, and sexy ways.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Amanda, Tabatha's twin sister, is having nightmares of her and Kyrians death (bloody death).  Ash practically puts New Orleans under lock-down because of the dreams and the Damions are attacking full force.<br /><br />It was difficult putting this one down.  Kyrian threw me.  I liked him in the book when he and Amanda fell in love, but his character was a real prick in this one.  Maybe I just felt really sorry for Valerius.  Goes to show how well Kenyon got the reader to relate to the characters.	2005-02-12

This second enstallment was much more serious and not so funny.  Not to say that is a bad thing, just I like being able to laugh.<br /><br />This sequel picks up only a few months where the first one left off.  Rachel finds herself penniless, rideless, and (after her latest job stiffs her) jobless.  While waiting for Ivy to give her a lift back to their home (in an other life it was a church) she is approached by a FIB agent and asked to accompany him back to the office; Mr. Edden (the guy who got her IS bounty dropped in the first book) wanted to see her.  Well, they needed help interviewing an Inderlander about a missing person; this missing person just might be the latest murder victim in a string of witch murders.  Rachel ends up becoming a consultant and hired by the FIB to make a run.  What she didn't expect was being partnered with Edden's son, Glenn.<br /><br />Right off the top Rachel is insistent that these murders were done by Trent Kalamack, her old nemesis.  Rachel goes into over drive demanding everyone at the FIB must arrest him because she knew in her GUT that he was the murderer.  And why won't anyone listen to her?  When the FIB refused to jump to her every little demand--she screamed, rant and pouted like a nine year old child. (Then she wondered why they took her off the case?--Hmmmm--I wonder?)<br /><br />In the Good, the Bad, and the Undead, the reader will be relieved to find out Trent's secret, Ivy's secret, and low and behold, Rachel's boyfriend, Nick's, secret, too. (What?  You didn't know he had a secret?) Many questions you probably had from the first will be answered.  Like in the first book, Jenks and his broad of children steal the show and much to my pleasure the sexy undead vampire Kirhin makes several very sexy appearances.  (I have a feeling we'll be seeing much more of him;-)<br /><br />I love Harrison's world she created.  The cast of characters are intriguing.  The plot will keep you reading.  I have only two faults.  The first was the editing.  For example, through when it should have been thorough and a multitude of extra and misplaced words causing the reader to stumble when he/she reads.  My second problem is Rachel's character.  She is such a baby. Self-absorbed and the temper-tantrums can drive a person to distraction.  All through the book she demands that she is right beyond question--that her gut instinct can't possible be wrong--only to find out she is wrong.  Plus, Harrison describes her as this tall frizzy haired board.  No boobs, no butt, not even nice hair, basically unattractive--yet all these men want to get in her pants?  How strange?  Oh well, I suppose minor problems in the whole sceme of things, unless your one of those people that can't get over it.

The first four to five chapters were a bit slow as you learn about Jack and his family background, but then quickly becomes fast paced when the Vikings (Northmen) attack.  Farmer takes Jack, his sister, Lucy, and the reader on a whirlwind adventure.  Jack discovers that he is definately not just a simple farm boy, but a great Bard (magician).<br /><br />What cracked me up about this book was all the underlying humor.  Farmer doesn't just tell a joke, you have to sift through her writing to find it.  I love the Jack and Jill part (you'll see--I don't want to spoil it, since it comes so close to the end.)  Also all the crazy Norse names, Like Olaf One-Brow and Sven Pretty Face.  What surprised me the most was her retelling of Beowulf.  I for one loved reading Beowulf in college (and a few times after).  I know most people have a hard time understanding the poetry of it, but Farmer broke down the jest of the poem into simple language.<br /><br />Basically the story is about Jack, a Bard apprentice, who was kidnapped, along with his sister, by Viking raiders.  Jack does whatever he has to do to save his sister and assure their return home, including battling Vikings, Spiders, trolls, and a motle crue of various supernatural creatures.	2005-01-17

Answers about both their mothers. This book picks up directly where the second left off and I would not recommend for anyone to try reading this one without reading the first two.<br /><br />Regardless of Leesil's determination to find his mother, especially after finding out in book two that she may still be alive, Margiere talks him into returning to her home in order to find information on her father (the vampire who mated with a human to create a warrior against his own people). The reader discovers early on in the story just what went into creating a Damphir (mainly the bloody sacrafice of five different magical creatures, each representing a different element--spirit, water, fire, earth, and air).  Hot on her tail is Welsteil and Chane (a partner), who is also determined that Margiere gains for him the treasure he seeks.<br /><br />This story is first a vampire book, second a horror, and lastly a romance.  If you think you will find the sultry romance which is becoming popular with authors such as Freeman, you need to look elsewhere.  There is very little romance and no sexual tension in these novels.  I'm not stating this as a negative, I actually prefer it this way, but I wanted to clarify what another reviewer mentioned.<br /><br />The reason I gave this book four instead of five stars is due to editing.  Several times I stumbled in my reading due to glitches in the print.  Extra words or missing words, causing the reader to have to reread to clarify the meaning of the text.	2005-01-15

I prefer fantasy to sci-fi, but I truly enjoyed this book.  I plan to look into reading more by Wen Spencer.<br /><br />Tinker is based only 30-40 years in the future.  In this world, a piece of Earth, Pitsburg (of all places) is now located on a planet from a different demention.  In this world, Elves are at the top of the food chain.  Once a month, Pitsburg is transfered back to Earth for 24 hours (called Shutdown).  For those 24 hours they are able to gather supplies, take care of business, etc.  Also during Shutdown, pretty much all electronic equipment, including phone lines, are dead.<br /><br />It was during this Shutdown that our hero (Tinker) saves an elf's life.  Spencer then brings us on a roller coaster ride, where we follow the lead character, a physic's genius at age 18, discover her first romance, as well as save the world (both of them) by becoming involve in political intrigue.<br /><br />What amazed me the most was the way Spencer was able to blend the romance, fight scenes, science, and political intrique together so flaulessly.

I don't particularily care for it unless it is joined with some other genre.  I do like Garbaldon's romance novels about the Highlands of Scottland since they are froth with adventure and intrigue, and I thought this book would be the same.  It's not.<br /><br />First and foremost, this is a Christian book.  It doesn't take one chapter to figure that one out.  The author goes on and on about how we must trust in God and put him first in his life and \\"surrender\\" to him.  Sure, that is all true, but if I wanted to hear that, I would pick up my bible.  The characters are very chaste.  The main character, Killian, is very God-fearing and religious,regardless of the fact she killed her husband, and even insist on withholding favors until after she is courted and then married by her second husband.  Goodness, they don't even kiss (only on the lips--shortly) until just before the wedding day.<br /><br />I don't mean to sound as though I am putting all this quaint religious fevor down, I only want the readers out there to understand what they are getting into when they read this novel, because I didn't.<br /><br />For a reader who is used to action, intrigue, betrayal, lust, and humor, you would want to pass this by.<br /><br />For those who prefer a more tame, holy book, sure you'll like this one.	2005-01-07

Regardless of the fact that her brother murdered her son and was involved with the people who burned her husband to death, Seri comes to the belief that her brother was used and manipulated in doing so by the enemies of her husband's people.<br /><br />When Seri arrives at Comigor she discovers a frightened, strange nephew and a prissy, self-absorbed sister-in-law.  While Seri's sister-in-law is bedridden from a dangerious pregnancy, Seri decides to help out running the home she loved as a child, for her nephew's sake.  She begins to make it her business in getting to know her nephew (a recluse) and tries numerous ways to draw him out.  The story becomes fast-paced when her nephew, Garrick, is kidnapped.  Seri goes on a dangerous journey, accompanied with friends from the previous novel, through two worlds to save Garrick.<br /><br />This novel is riddled with suspence, action, and surprises.  I'm usually very good at guessing what would happen next, but Berg left me guessing on several accounts and surprised me on several.  It took all I had to not flip to the end.  What I love most about Berg is her superb ability to show the true nature of humans.  I'm anxious for what next Berg has to offer.	2005-01-03

There was not much flow.  I had to reread several passages over again in order to understand what the author was trying to say.  The main character is deplorable.  I hate him.  The rape scene in the beginning definitely threw me for a loop.  What threw me for a bigger loop was the fact that he did not seem remorseful about it.  And yet, he is the hero?  All these people in this strange world worship him simply for what they think he represents--a hero reserected from their past.  He moves through their world wallowing in self pity, believing he is dreaming, and trying to find a way back home.  Why?  Beats me.  Why would one want to go home to be an outcast?<br /><br />The reason I gave this story three stars instead of one is the fact that the author has a unique story line.  I plan to read the second in the series for the sole purpose of seeing if he has somewhere he can take it.  And to see if Covenant (the main character) redeems himself for his horrible actions in some way--or at least pays for them.  One can only hope.	2004-12-29

Which was an improvement on the first story.  The discriptions were much more vivid, and of course Donaldson's dream world concept is fasinating.  It would be obvious to a babe that one could dig deeper and find profound meaning in his writing.  Yet, all I want to do is scream because I hate Covenant soooo much.  I just can't get past this man and his self consuming pity.  In the first book the reader has to put up with his rape of an innocent and sweet young girl.  Now we have to deal with him getting jiggy with his OWN DAUGHTER?!  Don't be fooled reader--he knows it's his daughter, as well as she knows he's her father.  Another note of distaste is the length of pages it takes just to march to the war.  The scene with the giants was extremely depressing--especially when the child killed his father.  Apparently, Donaldson was doing some parent-hating when he wrote this book.<br /><br />Oh well, I'm sure many will be discouraged or angry about my review.  I'm sure many will assume that I'm \\"just not getting it.\\"  So be it.  We all deserve to voice our opinions.	2004-12-29

Bartemus's character is wonderfully put together and it is easy for the reader to see that he is wise (how can he not be with all those years behind him).

Fallon begins the second book of the Second Sons Trilogy two years after the first.  Her characterization is the best I have ever read.  Working with over half a dozen characters, she stays true to each.  Their problems and strife nearly leap off of the page.  I'm amazed at how deeply she can capture the human psych (sorry, I'm not sure of the spelling).  The main character, Dirk, discovers the only way to \\"save the world\\" is to betray everyone he loves.  Antonov is a fanatic and believes what he does is for the Goddesses sake (which makes him more dangerous than most).  Kirshov is a good person at heart but is determined to prove his own merit.  Alenor finds herself more alone than she ever realizes and also realizes at the young age of 16, has to become more adult, responsible, and brave than any other adult in her family has ever been.  Belegren is becoming more desperate each day that she doesn't know when then next Age of Darkness will occur, especially when it becomes apparent that the lord does not seek nor need her advise.  Marqel becomes more cocky; believing everyone else the fool because they don't realize she would stoop to murder to get what she wants.  And Tia (Sorry, but this girl is a looney!  Honestly, I don't understand why Dirk bothers with her!  She's nothing but a big winey baby.  I for one hope that he gets to meet Jacinta and falls for her.  At least she has a brain and can use it.)  By the way, Jacinta is Alenor's cousin and new lady in waiting.  What is so great about her is that she has Marquel completely fooled and looking like a drooling idiot.<br /><br />Every character has a bit of bad and a bit of good.  The reader is able to relate to everyone.  Although I found myself shouting at the book, \\"My God!  Are you nuts!  Can't you see she's using you?!\\"  on several occassions.  I absolutely cannot wait for the next one!	2004-12-26

This one was a change--mostly because it contained werewolves.  I liked the beginning. Kenyon grabs the readers attention by showing the were brothers hanging from trees, left for dead.  She introduces the female character by receiving a fed-ex from her now ex, dumping her.  Very witty, very attention getting.<br /><br />My only fault is that she is alway elborating on how over weight Bride is and how self-conscience she is about it, yet during the first love scene, she's watching her body in the mirror.  Over weight women that have a problem with their bodies, would not be over eager to stare at them naked in a mirror.<br /><br />Vane is the man almost every woman dreams of.

After ten years of fighting in the war, Tier is on his way home.  He snuck away at the tender age of sixteen and is unsure of his welcome at the bakery.  In a small down along the way he comes across a Traveler being burned on a pier.  Upon entering the local tavern, he observes a second traveler about to be sold or burn and decides to step in and save the young life.  He places himself as the young girl's protector even against his own family who do not welcome her with open arms.  And this is where Briggs earns her four stars instead of five.  She skips twenty years in the future.  She literally gets you deeply interested in the lives of young Tier and Sereph and then moves them on to an old married couple with teenage children.  I would have loved reading more about how they fall in love.  What they had to endure in a world that would look upon the mixed marriage with disappoval.  Briggs does include a few flashbacks to their early marriage.  The story of the two teenage sons and one daughter is also wonderful.  They are interesting and unique characters; so the book is enjoyable regardless. I think you would find it well worth your time.	2004-11-01

Ten years have passed.  Jennet's unwanted, unloved husband finally passes away (relief for her).  Hannah is devestated after losing her husband and eight year old son (I cried when Donati finally explained what happened to them after reading over half of the book).

There was a lot of speculation on the setting being an alternate world due to the two suns.  I think it is Earth, only thousands of thousands of years in the future.  (After all, they do mention lions and wolves--only call them farie animals).  Hey, it could happen.<br /><br />Fallon introduces a whole strew of characters, all of which are well rounded and interesting.  Every one is sort of like yin-yang.  Bad with a little good, or good with a little bad.  It made the reading vastly interesting since the reader could relate to almost anyone.  The setting is vivid and easily pictured regardless in the difference from earth.<br /><br />The main character is a boy from an island.  Sixteen year old Dirk's life is interrupted when a pirate ship shipwrecks on his homeland leaving only one surivor.  The lone survior unwillingly pulls Dirk into political intrigue, fanatic religion,  as well as family secrets.

Freeman does a wonderful job of characterization. As stated before in previous reviews, each character is well rounded and interesting (evil, as well as the good guys). It was hard for me to pick up this book in the first place since the front cover was a turn off for me.  It reminded me of Planet of the Apes; only with mountain lions.  I am so not into Planet of the Apes, but now that I've finished it I regret not reading it sooner.<br /><br />The story is about a young soldier (like a foot soldier) named Rabbit (human) who while out lost with his troop meets up with Laurel (the human form mountain lion-a magical being).  After making a convenant with Laurel to save his troop, Laurel returns with the troop to speak with the commander to ask for protection to visit the king with a serious problem from his land.<br /><br />The conflicts:<br /><br />1. Humans hate, fear, and in some cases--don't believe in magical beings. Therefore it is dangerous for Laurel to be out on his own.<br /><br />2.  Possible war is on the horizon.  Since Laurel want's to speak to the king about the murder of several other magical beings (including sprites, unicorns, dragons, and other Faena like himself.)<br /><br />3.

I was so excited to see the heafty 650+ novel.  Normally I would finish one of her books in one to two nights, so the enjoyment of this one would last, I thought to myself.  The last novel (Merry Gentry one) was a major disappointment (all sex and absolutely NO PLOT--not an exaggeration, either).  She definitely had to have plot in this one.  I mean, how could she write 650 pages of nothing but sex scenes?  Well, ladies and gentlemen, call Believe It or Not! because she did. Okay, I'll be fair, about 600 pages were nothing but sex, the rest was plot.<br /><br />The story starts off promising.  Anita is serving, on the grooms side--tux and all--in Larry's wedding.  She gets a phone call at the reception to attend to a murder scene where a stripper was murdered by muliple bites of a vampire.  This is where I got really excited.  I was thinking to myself, \\"Yea! Plot!  The old LKH is BACK!  Then on page 30, give or take a few, begins the sex.  Then there is more and more, and by the way, MORE sex by multiple partners, places, times.  It's not even good sex, just the same old thing-but different partners.  Then around page 600, she solves the murders.  AUGH!<br /><br />Something has got to change.  I want my old Anita BACK!

Rachel, a witch and the main character, is in a type of law-enforcement that deals primarily in these magical creatures.  The only problem is she doesn't ever seem to catch a break.  The story starts with her attempting to capture a leprechaun.  On the drive back to the station (sharing a cab with a vampire and a pixie), she decides to quit the law-enforcement and use the leprechaun to make a clean break.  The only problem is everytime someone tries to break from this department, a death contract is put on their heads.  Rachel has to dodge crazed faries, weres, witches, etc. while trying to capture a huge law breaker to pay off her death contract.<br /><br />Rachel is funny and original.  I loved the pixies.

Granted it is fantasy, but hey, that's all I read.  What is the point of a great fantasy if you can't fall into the unrealistic?  This novel leaves me no opening.  The characters are unloveable, unrelatable, unwanted.  The narrator's voice, as well as the dialogue, was stilted and highhanded regardless of their status in society.  I think the author was trying to be proseful (but prose has everything to do with flow and little to do with 10 syllable words).<br /><br />What was with all the horses?  I mean here is this princess that goes all blubbery over a horse, but doesn't blink an eye for her brother or fiance'?  How realistic is that?  And don't give me it was a breakdown.  What?  She breaks down for EVERY horse, but never for her supposed love ones?<br /><br />And by God, what kind of ending was that?

Even his own vampire family can be a bit bothersome at times.  It's not like he is really undead--he can go out in the sun, with protective sunscrean; he can eat foods, with a supplement of a lot of blood; he doesn't sleep in a coffin, regardless of the fact there is one in his basement.  He can do lot's of normal everyday things.  So why is this nut job of an editor, Kate, hounding him.  First she writes constantly.  Asking for his email, his phone number, his consent to do public book signings.  I mean is she nuts?  She says his fiction vampire romance books are a hit, but what makes her think they are fiction.  The stories of how his parents, brother, and sister met their wife and husbands is absolutely true.  And to put the icing on the cake, the woman has actually showed up at his house and brought her luggage.  Sheesh!  Life will never be the same.<br /><br />This novel cracked me up!  I think you will enjoy it, too.	2004-09-07

I must say this author does, did, whatever, have promise.  The story has a great opening that truly catches the readers attention, but then drags all through the middle.  I found myself getting bored with all the court life talk; all the nuances of the back-stabbing court life.  After all, it has been done over and over in many such books.  I was looking for something different and unique to this one, but didn't find it.  Even the Jungle Book scene (girl raised by wolves) is over done.  Ya, ya, we get it--move on!  About three quarters of the way through I skipped to the end to see who is put on the thrown and then sighed because I couldn't get myself to bother reading the unread portion (strange for me, since I normally want to read it anyway just to see how it led to that conclusion).  Also, it pretty much grossed me out, this unspoken IN LOVE thing the herione has with her wolf partner.<br /><br />Basically what I saying is that I was bored for most of the story.  I heard book two and three are better and I'm thinking of trying the next one.  I'll keep my fingers cross that the author worked out all the kinks.	2004-09-07

Hidden Truth picks up where First Truth left off.  You have Alissa and Strell at the Hold being domestic, while fending off the evil Bailic. All three are becoming restless.  Strell, due to his unvoiced love of Alissa; Bailic, due to his wanting the book open; and Alissa, because she want's to know where the heck is that darn raku, Useless!<br /><br />Useless does show up of course and begins his tutorage of Alissa (of course in the nick of time to prevent Bailic's temper from overloading).  Bailic, thinking Strell is the Keeper, attempts to teach him magic and is pleased by the results (unbeknoweth to him that Alissa is the one actually performing the deeds.)  Bailic desides to attempt the rising of the ghosts of the nearby ghost village of Ese' Nawoer.  It doesn't work, but in the process Alissa does.  Enter Lodesh, ancient Warden of Ese Nawoer.  Things become increasingly interesting from here on.<br /><br />I actually read the third book in this series before this one.  Please don't do this, although it did not take away from the third in the series (increadibly good/funny) it did take away from Hidden Truth.  Having done this, I could easily see how Cook prepared and led the series into the third.  Everything in Hidden Truth is a set up for Forgotten Truth (Third).<br /><br />I highly recommend any and all books in this series, but please be prepared to stay up late finishing it off.	2004-08-29

I use to laugh like this for Janet Evonovich's Stephanie Plum novels, and what a relief to find a subtitute for the lacking series.<br /><br />Vampire readers, romance readers, and fantasy readers will enjoy this light comedy.  It begins with the death of the main character, Betsy.  She knows she is dead, but thinks something has happened to her to make her a walking zombie, goodness knows she doesn't remember being bit by a vampire (at least not in the convintional sense).  So she immediately tries to finish the job!  Jumping off buildings, electrocution, buses, noting works. Imagine the surprise on her family's face when they see her strolling in?  Imagine her hated step-mother's face?!  Then there are these crazy vampires who use every cliche' from the movies and are really sore at her for laughing at them because of it.  The one reward?  Eric!<br /><br />Guys, this novel is hilarious!  You will not be able to put it down!	2004-08-22

The people on this planet only know the blue sky through old outdated movies and check the weather on the news each morning to decide if they need to leave in a gas mask or not.  In this harsh climate you would find Cosmo, an orphan in a new world that has no place, nor use for orphans with the exception of testing new and dangerous products on them.  Miracle of all miracles he escapes and meets up with a gang of fighters who call themselves the supernaturalist.  With this gang he finally finds his family.  Unfortunately, he will also find himself fighting a war against stranger creatures that could possible affect the human race.<br /><br />Colfer, like normal, does a wonderful job in creating characters and setting that are superb.

I picked up the first in the series after reading the reviews and recommendations through amazon.com and have no regrets.<br /><br /> In this third installment, Alissa, our main character, is still struggling with flying lessons as a ruku and is practicing her skills as a master. Unfortunately, during one practice of tripping the lines, she is transported back hundreds of years in time. Back to when the castle was teaming with people. She meets new friends and interesting new characters, but also one old friend.<br /><br /> She tries despirately to get back especially when she realizes she is loosing control to Beast and soon realizes if she does not figure a way home, she could become Beast permentely.<br /><br /> What I like the most of Cook's book is her witty characters. I laughed aloud several times from their antics. Especially in the end. Just remember this: &quot;meat&quot; and &quot;I only need one night,&quot; and think of me. I'm smiling again just thinking about it.	2004-07-28

I know I did.<br /><br />The story is about a young woman, Alissa, who was sent out of her home by her mother (only surviving relative) and told to go on a journey that she would inately know where to go.  Well, of course, Alissa is devestated, confused, and even a bit angry about this whole thing.  I mean, what?, is her mom off the rocker or what?  Without much choice she heads out on the same journey her father took and never came back from almost 10 years previously.<br /><br />Our second main character is Strell, coming home from a long journey that his family sent him on several years previously.  He and Alissa cross without seeing each other heading in opposite directions.  Strell comes across Alissa's mom and discovers that his entire family is wiped out in a horrible accident.  He is the lone survivor.  Distraught, he takes to the road to run away from his sorrow.  Only to run into Alissa, stuck at the bottom of a small cliff and very irate over her predictament.  From here on begins the real adventure.  These two characters are hilarious together (between Alissa's bumbling and smart remarks to Strells witty and boyishly sweet good humor) you will never get enough.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a light, yet wonderfully witty penned book.	2004-07-28

Those of which were done by readers who read previous books by Kay.  All gave him fewer than five stars and stated the reason was that Kay's previous books were better.<br /><br />Well, this is the first book I've read by Kay and I have no other books to compare it to other than the drivel that sometimes comes from aspiring writers.  I found Last Light of the Sun to be well written and page turning.  There was an impression Kay added to paper that had more to do with the daily lives of the characters.  He showed us how each of us and the decisions we make can affect everyone we come into contact with.  I especially liked the way he would stop and explain the path of life the less than minor characters took after coming into contact with a major character.  He didn't drone on and on, but simply took a few paragraphs to a couple of pages to name the person they ran into, hired, whatever, and said what became of them.  It made me think of all the impressions I place on the people I come into contact with.  People I know I will never see again, but perhaps there was something I said or did that pushed them choose a different path in life.  Was it positive, negative, or nothing at all?<br /><br />Now to the book, those of you wondering what the story is about; basically you have two main characters:  Barn and Alun.  The story flips from characters to characters as well as several others major charcters that stay in close contact with these two.  Barn represents the viking aspect--maradering, killing, etc.  But he really is just a good guy that had a lot of bad luck in his life.  Basicallly he is just trying to keep his butt out of trouble.  Then you have Alun, who represents the Welch prince (other names used in book).  He goes through a tramatic life alternating experence and wants revenge.  Other characters include fathers, kings, and the king's children.  There are women in the story, but Kay is a very well researched author and properly gave women the same rights they had in this time period--NONE.  Although a few women, very few, have the intelligence to use what they have to their best advantage.  Those women with the wholier than thou attitude--leave it behind before you pick up the book.  (I can say these things because I'm a women):-)  Kay flips back and forth between all characters and then slowly brings them together in the end.<br /><br />I read this in under two days and kept wanting to flip forward to make sure characters were going to be reintroduce quickly before reading on.  I greatly enjoyed this book and am eager to read all these other books Kay has written that is supposedly much better than this one.

It drove be batty--what kind of author would name a character after an allergy medicine?) who meets this vampire.  Now this girl is painted by the author as having all these issues about being in control.  Apparently she had this real lame husband who beat her as well as other things I won't bother to mention for those of you who want to read the book.<br />Then you have this vampire, Christian, (Another name that drove me crazy because I kept forgetting this was his name and then she would use it in a sentence and I thought she was talking relegion--how weird is that?)  Who is desperate to find the love of his life in order to complete him.  (This entire plot practicaly stunk of a very popular series by another author who I will not name--which cause another problem with me because I cannot stand authors who steal plots.)<br />Okay, so the author goes on and on about how perfect Christian is physically, but is a real pig when it comes to women's rights.  All she says about the heroine is that she has weird eyes and a messed up leg.  She doesn't tell you anything else about how she looks, so you are left with a limping shadow woman when you picture the scenes in your mind.  Yet, they are maddly drawn together.  Next thing you know it they can't get enough of each other.  This premise totally goes against what she set up in the beginning.<br />Ultimately, the author's characterization bites the big one.  And I don't know about you, but if the characterization stinks--the book stinks.<br />I gave it two stars because the sex scenes were okay.<br />Hope this helps.	2004-07-12

Knight has dispelled that worry completely in his second installment &quot;Choice of the Cat.&quot;  There is just as much intrigue, action, humor, and human flaws (if not more) than the first.  I especially like the way he chooses to not repeat, or flashback, to the previous book, like so many other novelist do. These recalls for those who don't remember what happened before slow down the flow of the text.  This can definitely be a stand alone novel, although, I would highly DEMAMD you read the first for the simple reason it is just that GOOD!<br />For those of you who can't figure it out by the title, Valentine leaves the Wolves (not that he is given much of a choice) and is recruited (another nonchoice) as a Cat.

She has a close nitch of friends, one of which she falls into love with.  They marry and are happy.  Problem: He is a sorcerer, which is punishable by torture and death in society.  Seri helps keep her husbands secret and supports his choices.  Karen, Seri's husband, has a special gift that allows him to heal the sick (somethimes from even close death).  Regardless of the risk of being caught, Karen continues to use his powers for any in need.  Eventually, he is caught.

The original trilogy was fantastic.  From there it became a little repetitive.  This latest addition was a welcomed change.  One of my problems with previous novels was the extreme description of music.  Shinn could spend an entire chapter describing the rise and fall of angel voices in song.  Almost all her novels were concerned about the archangel.  In this case, she concentrates on two women (not angels at all) and their perspectives.  A Jansai woman and an angel-seeker.  In both women she shows the trials and tribulations of misunderstood and persecuted women doing what they have to do to survive, truely live, and love.  Shinn twines these two women's lives together in an unexpected and touching way.<br />It's a long novel, but you will find it hard to put down.

I had tripidation since I realized it was a teen book and I just wasn't in the mood for that sappy-teen-best-friendness-trist.  It wasn't until I came to fill out this review that I realized that I am the 530th reviewer.  I had no idea just how popular this book became.<br />Well, I can honestly say it was well worth my time.  This is a story about four friends spending their first summer apart.  These 15, almost 16, year old girls have been friends since before birth and are different from each other in every way you could imagine.  Yet, they support and love each other unconditionally.  When Puerto Rican, Carmen, buys a pair of jeans at a thrift store, she doesn't even bother to try them on.  Not until she is packing for her summer away with her father and decides to throw them out, that ratical Tibby ask if she could have them.  Tibby tries them on and the girls are amazed at how good they look on her.  Each girl then takes a turn trying on the \\"magical\\" jeans and discover that they each look fantastical regardless of height or body shape.  They then form a pack to share the jeans throughout the summer.  Never to wash them and express mail them to the next girl after they are through.<br />I know, this sounds incredibly corney.  The surprise is it's not.  The girls begin their summer discovering who they really are.  Tibby meets a dying 12 year old girl that teaches her how to see the world in a different light.  Carmen creates a new relationship with her dad.  Lena gets to know her grandparents in Greece and (well, I don't want to say anything else--this part really cracks me up).  Bridget (probably the most disturbed teen) makes a horrible mistake.<br />Teen or adult, you cannot go wrong with this novel.  A wonderful, touching, tearful read.	2004-04-13

The main character of the book did seem to possibly have a decent sense of humor, but I spent his entire time describing the Nightside and just how different it was from the real world.  I mean, the entire time he was discribing over and over just how different it was.  He would then explain in detail over and over each and every character in the Nightside.  Augh! how boring!

Normally second books never measure up to the first, and yet Britain surpassed the first.  In First Rider's Call, Karigan is older, more mature, and stronger.  She fights the rider's call for several years only to give into the horn's call. What I liked about this sequel in paticular is that Britain added in a few laughs here and there to take away from the serious subject matter.  Readers, get ready to find out just HOW Karigan answered the call.  I loved the way the characters became more well rounded.  The reader learns alot more about the king, as well as the first rider, and Karigan's orginial ancestor.  There were several touching scenes (I got teary eyed during the scene where Lil said farewell of her lost green riders.)<br />I don't want to say too much and spoil the book, but here's is just a brief on what's going on.  Karigan is haunted by a ghost, Lil, the first green rider.  Lil (a ghost)has been trying everything in her unearthly power to get Karigan to answer the call.  Eventually, deparate to get Karigan going back to join the green riders, she blows the horn (famous horn that will summon all green riders).  It works.  Karigan arrives back to the city to offer her services to the king and join the green riders.  Well, the king nearly falls off his thrown by the sight of her. No time for romance, because unfortunately, something is not right in the kingdom.  There has been strange happenings.  Karigan is sent on a mission when a powerful wraith is released from a prison.  After 1000 years, it looks like the dark lord is coming back.<br />This novel is well worth your time.	2004-04-04

It was interesting to read about Grey, but the book as a whole reminded me of a cheesy dective mystery on old T.V.  You know the one.  Where there is no way to possibly guess the ending because absolutely nothing connects, then the bad guy takes the last 30 pages of the book explaining the whole plan.  All the characters say, oh, so that's why.  Only the reader is left dumbfounded.  Normally, I reread to make sure I understand the story, but, well, I just couldn't make myself go through the story one more time.

This book is well worth your time and money.  The story entails a very young girl, Karigan, who completes a mission for a Green Rider (sort of like the pony express).  What I liked about Karigan is that she is a young girl, that doesn't act overly mature.  She's not the best student or overly favorite of everyone she meets.  In other words, she is a character with flaws, which makes her well rounded and interesting.  There is a possibility of a relationship in future books with perhaps one of two characters, but it was only hinted at and Karigan's character does not acknowledge it, which also speaks well for staying true to her age.  I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series.	2004-03-26

After only a few days after arrival, her aunt becomes ill and then dies.  Unfortunately, she's poisoned and Thomasine is the number one suspect.  Its then up to Sister Frevisse to solve the mystery and find out who did the horrible deed.<br />This is an interesting mystery.  I gave it only four stars because I guessed who did it immediately, although I didn't know why.  It was worth reading to find out why.	2004-03-09

This book had such high aclaim, I felt obligated to finish it, assuming that it would eventally get better.  I admit the beginning of this novel was intriguing, but there was just too many details about the Bible and the lost pages.  After having to read Brown repeat himself about the keystone over and over, I felt like I was going through a slow death.  The reason why I gave three stars was for the character development.  I enjoyed the individual characters (with the exception of Sophie--who was flat) and their independent personalities.	2004-03-04

What I mean is, not only in dialogue, but even in normal discriptions and narratives.  I was having to read the same paragraph, chapter, everything, over and over just to picture what was happening in the story, and still did not have a clue what the narrator was speaking about.<br />Very poor writting.	2004-03-04

Knight set up an elaborate world with strange and interesting creatures.  This is a world of terror for any human. In this world, strange vampire like creatures from another world rule Earth.  They basically use humans as cattle, feeding on them as need arises.  A few humans due their bidding in hopes of earning a brass ring that will allow them to be exempt from becoming food to another passing vampire.  Others migrate to colder areas where the vampires are not likely to come.  Lastly, a rebel band of people fight to save as many people as possible and perhaps even take back their world.  These band of rebels are aided and trained by another alien related to the vampires.  The rebel bands are separated into three groups--wolves, bears, cats.  Here enters our hero, David Valentine, a Native American whose family was murdered and raped by a scouting group of humans who work for the vampires.  When David becomes older, he decides to join the rebels.  Knight goes on to describe David's experences as a rebel and the harsh cruelty he and his fellow rebelers are fighting against.<br />There would be no words available for me to express how vivid and interesting this novel is. I sit on edge waiting for the sequel.	2004-03-04

The herione is left alone with no close family, with the exception of a harsh aunt.  After receiving an interesting letter of warning, she seeks out a strange name and encounters a group of strange and very different friends, as well as enemies.  All in all, she uncovers her father's murderer, solves the mystery of the ruby, and even discovers a possible love.

I did not have the pleasure of reading the Lioness series, but after finishing this book I am definately intrigued.  Ally, a young 16 year old, wants to be a spy like her father.  The problem is her father and mother will not hear of it.  Well, the choice is taken from them when Ally runs off to prove herself only to have her small boat taken over and made into a slave.  She then uses her many spy talents taught to her by her father to establish herself as an unbeddable slave.  Strangly enough, she makes herself so unwanted that no one makes a bid for her on the auction block and she is given to a big buyer for free instead.  Okay, now that I've discribed the first chapter, lets move on.  Yes!  All this in only the first chapter!  The pace definately does not slow down through out this entire novel.  Just to quickly sum the basic up:  Ally becomes entangled with the Trickser god and takes up a wager with him.  She promises to keep a couple of young ladies alive throughout the summer and he will send her straight back home.  The problem:  this young ladies are actually the possible future heirs to the thrown, only no one realizes this with the exception of the enslaved people (which they are 1/2 of).  Ally proves her worth and is quickly admired by everyone whe encounters.  Luckly, Pierce, creates a very likable character with a lot of wit and humor. As a reader, you can't help but smile at her sarcastic and self-appreciating comments.  This ones a must read.	2004-02-16

Her books are a great distraction as well as mind-candy.  I even put in an order for this book before it was even published, then eagerly awaited its arrival.  All that anticipation ended like a balloon with a hole.<br />The story of Merry picks up with her harem (um, I mean guards).  The boys are back, trying their best to impregnant their (hopefully) future queen.  This is where everything gets difficult.  You see, I want to explain the plot, but there is no plot to explain. Scenes of the book move from one sexual romp to another, even going as far as girl on girl. Perhaps I'm just too innocent, but that was a new one for me.  About half way through the book, the reader finally gets excited, because it sounds like something is actually going to happen.  Merry and her men have an agenda.  They are to visit the Seelie Court, then King Kurag (who want her to attempt procreation with a few of his creepy dudes), then on to the Unseelie Court.  Yeah!  Possible conflict, possible suspense, possible action!  Then just more sex.<br />Oh, well.  It won't stop me from reading her books, since I truly do love the Anita series and did love the Merry series. I hope Hamilton does read these reviews and perhaps she will take a little more time in building up the elements of plot in her future books so that instead of a feeling of dispointment, we can all lay back in the afterglow. (No pun intended!)	2004-02-06

Similar enough to our own world, yet vastly different in their religious beliefs to make the story interenting.  I like her thought of worshiping five gods (father, mother, son, daughter, bastard) and how each represents a different aspect of the people, with bastard taking on all the leftovers (that leaves a touch of dry humor to the mix).  Then there is the country at war with the one in the book, mostly because they don't believe in worshiping the bastard god.  More about this group of people is brought about in the book two.<br />What book one is mostly about is Cas.  A man captured in war, vastly mistreated, who turns to the household he worked as page for as a youth.  He has no remaining family and finds his resources limited.  Luckly, he is remembered by the old matron who is still living and is given a job to tutor her granddaughter.  Not to give the entire story away, he is thrown in the middle of court intrigue and a family curse.  (Oh, there is also a beautiful girl who he moons over but thinks is out of his league--this part is predictable).<br />The story is well written and the characters interesting, as well as well rounded.  Cas is a bit too good to be true, but you can overlook it because he really does seem like a really nice guy, besides all these bad things keep happening to him.	2004-01-26

I took the time to read through a few reviews before writing my own, for the sake of not repeating what others have already stated.  What a shock I found.  No, this novel was not up to par compared to her early novels, but I see things differently than most of the replies out there.  First of all, in real life, people grow and change depending on their experiences.  So get this through your thick sculls:  Lestat will not, could not possibly be like, his orginial character from book one.  This is a vampire that has #1 blood in him making him stronger than almost any other (so hell yeah I would be scared of him if I was Mona, Julien, etc.) He has gone to Heaven and Hell and back.  He's even lost his body.  People, Vampires, change.<br />Second, I don't know what book you all others read, but Mona was always a spoiled, brat, who was always jeolous of Rowan.  Nothing changed there.  The last time Rowan was in a story, she was showing signs of burn out.  Anne Rice was following through with the effects of causes which occured in her previous books.  Characters must change to seem believable, they don't always change the way you wish them to.<br />Lastly, I think Anne WAS using Lestat as her voice.  I would like to think she was telling Stan that she will join him when her work is done.  Much like Lestat told Rowan he would come for her when her work will be done.  Like I hope one day to join those I love.	2004-01-13

I will say that these Lady Appleton books are fasinating and well worth your time.<br />Emerson does a wonderful job in creating well rounded characters in a realistic setting which is true to European history.  The characters and their personality change accoring to the ups and downs in their lives, yet still stay true to their individual personality.  I can't say enough about the wondersul writing ability of Emerson.  Well down!	2004-01-13

If you are into vampires, werewolves, violence, heavy sexual tension, this is definitely the book for you.  These things were not alway my forte, but Hamilton pulls it all together farely well.  Anita is put into a lot of wild situations, even for a necromancer (raiser of the dead).  I do have two complaints, though (which were not so horrible to cause me to reduce the amount of stars).  First, all the men are beyond gorgeous--not very realistic, with long hair and unbelievable bodies.  Second, apparently, every last one of them want to jump Anita's bones.<br />I completed this book in one night.  It is an easy read and a great book to escape from the mundane world.	2004-01-13

Lady Appleton, married to a womanizing prigg, spends her time solving murder cases.  She's an only child, which was the cause for her unusal education (for a girl that is).  i. e. She was the son her father never had.  She not overly attractive either, which is a break from the norm.  Luckly, she's got brains out the wazo and her husband is often away from home (being a spy and all) so it's up to Lady Appleton to save the day.<br />I know this all sounds common place, but the author pulls it off with outstanding wit and dry humor.  She also does a wonderful job of bring the Elizabethian time period true to life.  You won't be disappointed.	2004-01-13

For the most part the characters are interesting and diverse.  My only complaint was that the author could drag on a fight scene forever.  A short encounter can go on for thirty pages with discriptions and flashbacks.  These &quot;action&quot; scenes can be a tension grabber, but when a reader has to read and read and read and read just to find out who the attactor is, well, you kind of just loose interest.  I kept finding myself flipping to a few pages ahead to see when it would end.  Normally I would give three stars for an author with this problem, but because the two previous books were for the most part much better, I gave her an extra star for previous good writing.	2004-01-05

Katmax1 did an excellent job in that and if you have any questions, please refer to that review.  What I do want to impart is that Berg is a fantastic writer with some of they most rounded and interesting characters I have read.  The world she creates is vivid and remarkably realistic for a fantasy world.  It is easy to fall into her books because of these reasons.<br />Most of the reviews I read had one major complaint -- the ending.  I won't give away what happened, but for those of you out there who are apprehensive about picking up this book simply because your afraid of being disappointed in the ending, please do not let these few discourage you.  I, for one, GOT the ending.  I think most readers are picturing themselves as the characters and are thinking about how they would handle the situation and what they would do in the characters situation.  Whereas, the two main characters are not like normal people and they had very tramatic experiences in their lives that would effect how they would handle situations.  I thought Berg chose to end the story well based on the characters.  She stayed true to her art.  Frankly, I can't wait to read what she comes up with next.  ;-)	2003-12-29

I'm not saying that it was not well writen and interesting, just a surprise for someone who was expecting a certain type of vampire.<br />In this book several of interesting characters come together in Las Vegas, which happens to be a very popular resting place for light-addicted vampires (wish she left that out, it was just too weird.)  The group of three vampires and one human need to stop a crazed magician, as well as a fanatic who wants to kill all vampires.<br />This just wasn't as intersting and unique as the previous novels.

I must ask, though, how does anyone put this book down?  I stayed up to two, three, o'clock three night in a row and then unwantonly fell asleep.  Bujold creates a vivid fantasy world.  This is the first novel of hers I have read.  I understand that this is a continuation of a previous novel, but I was not confused or felt lacking in any way, so that it can be a stand alone novel.<br />Ista feels she must escape the confines of her home and jailers (love ones).  She plans a retreat that she must ask permission to go on and barely makes it out of her home with her choice of retinue.  After only a few days on the roads, she discovers that the gods have plans for her (or more specifically, one particular god).

At first Roe is put off when all her friends find some place in the movie, either stunt work or leasing the church for filming, but gets over it when her once upon a time romance with Robin begins to heat up again.  (Excuse me, but are those books your shelving or are you just happy to see me?)Of course it wouldn't be a mystery without a little murder.  When the leading lady turns up dead, it's up to Roe to find out Who Dune It.	2003-08-06

The worlds and people created are so vivid and strong.  Each and every character is unique.  Their attitudes, demeander, and how they handle situations are completely different from others.  Plus they hold their character throughout the entire story--series.  I've read so many novels where every character was a carbon copy of how the arthur feels and sees the world.  Not so with Berg's novel.  There are characters with major flaws, and yet the reader can't help but relate to them.  What is most compelling is that not everything works out to the main characters advantage.  Bad things happen and they happen in this book.<br />In the second installment of this series, Seyonnne's life is not perfect in his homeland of Ezzaria.  Despite all he has gone through in fighting and defeating the Deamons in the first novel, Transformation, many of his people do not trust him. He is now their only Warden, until he has completed training the younger boys, and fights sometimes even two to three battles a day.  Instead of his wife, Ysanne, acting as Aife in these battles, the elders have chosen another, Fiona, as his Aife.  Only Fiona is really there to watch and monitor Seyonne to make sure he is not contaminated.<br />When Seyonne discovers a Demon, who is not evil, in a body and decides to not destroy or remove him, Fiona is quick to report this to the elders and Seyonne finds himself banned from Ezzaria.  This is not the end, of course, but only the beginning.  Seyonne has his own problems to solve and takes on many for friends.  He has his abandon son (yes, son) to find, his long time friend and once master has problems in the kingdom Seyonne vows to help with, and we meet a new character, Blaise who's very life depends on what Seyonne can discover in the world of demons.<br />You will find it hard to put this novel down and if you are like me, will find yourself caught up in the lives of the characters.  I admit, I even cried at some points.in the lives of the characters.  I admit, I even cried at some points.	2003-08-06

If you like the Anita Blake series, you'll like this one, too.  It has the vampires, the shape-shifters, and sexual tension (only on a tammer scale).  What I do like about this series that Anita Blake doesn't have is the humor.  Can you imagine Elvis (oops, I said it) as a vampire?  Well, just call him Bubba.<br />In this third edition of the series, Sookie is frustrated with Bill's put-offness.  He's just not as affectionate as he use to be.  When Bill runs off on a secret misssion and Bubba arrives to protect Sookie, something is definiately wrong.  Sookie is brought into the intrigue by sexy Eric and introduced to the Jackson vampire elite by pretending to be a Were's girlfriend.  Did I mention the Were, Alcide, is HOT, HOT, HOT!  Well, it's not all sexual tension, there is a whole lot of action going on and Sookie even has to take on a vampire in hand to hand.  You go girl!  The only problem with this latest installment is the wait for the fourth.<br />Keep'em coming Harris!	2003-08-06

In this third installment of the Keeper's Chronicles, the story focuses on the newest and strongest Keeper, Diana, Claire's little sis.  Although the story drags a bit and the plot is a little corney, the story still contains the dry sense of humor that is well known to this series.  What really keeps the story going is Austin, the cat.  His charater is a trip.<br />Basically, Diana get's her first summons one minute after finishing high school and is sent to the local mall in Claire's town.  So why didn't Claire get the summoning?  Apparently because there was need for the strongest Keeper (which would now be Diana--since she is the youngest).  Diana does ask for Claire's help and what they find in the Otherside are elves, Arthur, and shadow monsters.  Not to mention a dirty old man.  Oh, and Diana falls in love.	2003-08-06

I almost never flip ahead in a book to see what is happening and I did in this one.  I eagerly wanted to know what was going on with other characters.  All the characters are well rounded and interesting.  You can easily relate to any one of them, even the wicked ones on some accounts.<br />In the third book of the Witches of Eileanan series, the story line mostly focuses on the war at hand.  The story flips from one character to the next as the reader follows the war from several different angles.  It was an interesting way of writing the book.  Although, because so much focus was put on the details of the war, I decided to give four stars.  I don't mind explaining what is happening, but Forsyth was describing in detail hand to hand combat constantly and it caused the story to drag in some places.<br />Regardless, I have to admit I weeped at some points, especially when characters I began to enjoy reading about, died horribly, or gave up willingly. You'll have to read to find out more.<br />Those of you out there that have not read any books in this series, I urge you to give it a try, but recommend you began with the first.<br />Happy reading!	2003-07-21

I am a vampire fiction fan, so I enjoy Freehan's idea of the two separate races.  It's a different and unique way of thinking about vampires.  Most books I've read in this series, though, lie heavy on the steamy sex scenes and there is not much room for any actual plot (disappointing).  In this contribution, finds his woman (who is surprising NOT human--a step from the norm that Freehan has been writing in the series) and he still needs to overcome his evil brother.<br />Normally, I would give Freehan's books three stars, but since this one actually contains a plot, even if it is an extrememly predictable one and has an obvious solution, and just doesn't revolve around sex, I decided to give it four stars.	2003-07-10

They are easy to read, easy to follow, and require very little thought process.  Sounds boring?  Actually, not really.

Overall she seems to be a good writer and her novel had direction as far as the topic, scenery, motion of action.  Her flaw seemed to be a lack of good character development.  Every character in the story seemed to be flat/one dementional.  All the werewolves were elite and confident.  All the humans were gullible and predictable.  The characters in the book were incapable of making mistakes.  They knew what they did was right and if something went wrong, it was not his/her fault, but had to be an external cause.  It is amazing just how important character development can be for a novel, even when the author has a supurb idea for conflict and direction in a book.<br />I will read the next one, for the simple hope that she might improve in her writing, but for this one, my feelings at the end of the novel were disappointment.	2003-07-02

She was so busy giving detailed descriptions with the setting that she easily lost sight of the story.  This novel proved what a wonderful writer she is.  She included the perfect mix throughout.  Her writing was very discriptive at the same time carrying along the story.  Her characters were true to life and she pulled her very best from her past work.<br />In this novel, Mrs. Rice combines the Vampire Cronicles, the Mayfair Witches, and the Talamasca.  Our young hero is tall, dark and (of course) handsome. He is also true of heart and pure.  All his life he has been able to see spirits and ghost, yet has had a loving and supportive family (with the exception being his mother) to turn to and help him through his struggles. He also finds the love of his life (enter Mayfair Witches)whom he looks forward to marrying. Unfortunately, he was taken against his will to be made into a blood drinker.  He seeks the help of Lestat to tell his life story to, and to help in ridding him of a most fearsome spirit that has plagued him for all his life.  Mrs. Rice also throws in a surprise ending (or two)for good measure.<br />Over all, I found this to be a very satisfying read and hope that the next novel will pick up where this one left off.	2002-12-30

I'm shocked that so many have compared this series of books to Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series and have not noticed just how much Harris is coping of off Hamilton.  So what if she cut out some of the gore, she still has the love triangles between the herorine, vampires, and shapeshifers.  The vampires have their own little protocol levels in both series and the shapeshifters have their little communities.  Not to mention this all out every-male-wants-a-piece-of-that attraction to the heroine is abundant in both books. It is so like the Anita Blake series that is makes the whole story line redundant.<br />I don't believe Harris is up to par with Hamilton.  With Hamilton you have a clear mental image of what is occuring in the story regardless if it is a fight scene or a love scene.  With Harris either one is not very clear.  I had to read the parts over several times to understand who was hitting who or who was hitting on who (depending on fight or love).<br />The only good thing I can say about the series is that it can serve as a go between while a reader waits on the next Anita Blake series.  For those of you who considered this series as being orginial and different, pick up Laurell K. Hamimlton's series.  They have been around far longer and are still very popular.	2002-09-22

I can only guess that most of these reviewers have never read the Anita Blake series by Laurell Hamilton.  If they did they would see the unmistakable resemblence.  It was like Charlaine Harris had a copy of Hamilton's book beside her computer to refer to as she wrote this story.  Unfortunately, it wasn't exactly up to par.<br />I found the main character, Sookie, to be superficial and spacey.  She brought new meaning to the term, dumb blonde.  The entire story was predictiable.  I was able to guess the killer from the very beginning of the story, when the character was introduced.  Boy, was I surprised when I realized I guessed right! NOT!<br />I suppose you are wondering why I gave it 3 stars?  Well, there is another author that I enjoy reading very much (Janet Evonvich) and, unfortunately, she only produces about one book a year.  She does have an internet site where fans can write story lines and chapters picking up where her latest book left off.  It is sort of like an appitizer until her next book comes in.  By no means can they compare to her writing, though.  Well, I consider Charlaine Harris to be the amateur writer to Laurell Hamilton.  She is only a small appitizer until Hamilton puts out another book.	2002-09-22

What a wonderful enjoyment!  I actually listened to the story on tape on my way to and from work and discovered that it was not such a good idea.  Peabody is a bit quirky and her character will make you smile, but there are some scenes that one really needs to concentrate on, and behind the wheel is not a place to do it.<br />I did enjoy the novel and have continued to read each new book in the series.  My goal is to eventually go back and pick up the previous seven installments.	2002-09-22

US	39663319	R1DQMD1XAXX53E	0312265859	52382288	Hard Eight (Stephanie Plum)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	lacking	I have been a huge Evanovich fan from the very first Plum novel.  I was very disappointed in \\"Hard Eight.\\"  For seven whole books she stringed us along wondering what Ranger would be like, only to let us down with the extremely short result.  I found all her adventures in this novel were too neatly wrapped up.  Her criminals were too easily caught too quickly.  I don't want to give away details, so it's hard to explain myself as fully as I would like to, but I hope the next Plum mystery has more meat to it than this one did.	2002-07-05

Up front, I want to tell anyone who reads Hamilton's books simply because she gives great sex scenes, then this book is definitely for you.  I read all the previous reviews and I can see the point of all of them, bad and good.  ...You need to realize that writing (and reading) is purely for enjoyment.  <br />It is easy to see that Hamilton wrote this book as a go-between of the first and those to come.  She is setting the scene of something big to come.  I thought this was an important bases to help the readers get a better understanding of each character.  I for one enjoyed reading about how each has grown and changed from the first novel to the end of this second one.  She also gave background on a few (All the Guys).  <br />...[N]ot all sexy guys have got to have long hair.  I mean, come on, it's getting a bit redundant.  I know the fairie court has a thing with long hair, but between the vampire series and this one, the long hair is getting soooo old.<br />Happy Reading.  I hope L. Hamilton hurries with the next book.<BR>;-)	2002-05-06

I love the way Wrede took a common fairy tale belief and put a twist on it.  As an adult, I thought it was funny and attention getting.  I've also recommended to several teenagers, who gobbled up all four books in the series in a matter of a few days.	2002-03-09

I actually fell off my bed laughing.  The main character, Stephanie Plum, is someone everyone can relate to.  She is quirky, clumsy, how-many-more-cars-can-I-go-though, man-(oops, men-) problems, just-lost-my-job-now-I've-got-to-get-help-from-my-family type of person.  And talk about crazy family.  Trust me, you'll love them.  She also has a wonderful website....	2002-03-09
US	39663319	R3QNBG1FTC025K	0440212561	983256815	Outlander	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Surprisingly interesting	I was told by many people to try this author out, but held off for several years.  The books are so large and intimidating.  I never felt I would have the time to read the whole thing, not to mention I normally hate romance novels.  I finaly gave in and tried Outlander and what a surprise.  This is no ordinary romance novel...this is an adventure, fantasy, action novel.  I read the whole book in a matter of three days.  They ran to the local book store (no offense amazon) to pick up the next.  I can't wait until Gabaldon continues the series with another novel.	2002-03-09
