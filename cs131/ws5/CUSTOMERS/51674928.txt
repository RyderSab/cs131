Where I was thoroughly enjoying the first half of this book by the end I found the author a whine of inaction. Yes, I get it - your name is JR - they are not your initials - your father left you -  you have an identity crises. But do I need reminding every ten pages? Where the bar sequences are fun the book is ultimately about nothing. The author feels sorry for himself but doesn't act. After years of loving his time at the bar the writer has a sudden and not very well explained turn from his haven. Why?  <br /> <br />Also, all those years of heavy drinking with no consequence. Really. No consequence to any fellow customerS. Really? <br /> <br />I'm also tired of writers and filmakers now using 9/11 as a self discovery tool. It is both cliched and insulting. <br /> <br />The book committed the worst sin of a memoir - I stopped believing it.	2005-10-07
US	51674928	RK7VKE2SG7OO7	0312319142	298733702	Paranoia	Books	1	12	21	N	N	Weak and predictable.	From the reviews on the dust jacket I expected something different. Then I realized the paid off hacks who had written them. The story is standard (think The Firm in the computer industry without any real excitement). If you cannot predict the \\"BIG PLOT TWIST\\" you must not read a lot. The author thinks he is funny but is not. He writes like a juvenile. You'll care not an ounce for the characters. And what's with the 'my old man is cranky, dying and does not love me \\" sub-plot - how manty times have we been there?. Too much filler, too little excitement, too little originality. A real disappointment.	2004-10-06

Rings untrue. A violent mental patient left to wander unobstructed, injuring guards, injuring patients as part of his treatment. Come on?

If DeMille wanted to write a travel book about his return to his war haunts why not present it as a travel book. The jouney while somewhat interesting is also repetitive and long. And, can we have some variety in character. No matter what the names, they are always the smarmy middle aged, self important and self defacing, though pretending not to be hero, and the semi-dum mid-thirties brunette, fawning over our hero. Does DeMille have confidence problems with women?	2003-09-23

This is what Ireland and it's people are like - forget the contrived, tear jerking Angela's Ashes. This book captures the humor, dialogue and social atmosphere of my country. The good and bad of a modernising and newly international Ireland are all in here. With small snippets of captured conversation McCarthy brings to life the heart and personality of my country. Makes me want to rent a car and take the trip myself. This is a book written for and about a country that can always laugh at itself and enjoy itself for it's faults (something McCourt lost in his travels and sour grapes). <br />A perfect read.

If the author's sole intention was to create a depressed, hopeless atmosphere he succeeded admirably. If he wanted me to care about any of the characters he failed.

Two thirds of the way through I was tired of all the wise cracking and hoping the plot would pick up. It didn't. Lousey ending, too many 'X-files' references and did DeMille have to take a shot at every critic who did not  like the 'General's Daughter'. The movie did stink Nelson!	2000-02-08
US	51674928	RDD39EQPJHAAN	031286860X	106877023	Ender's Shadow (The Shadow Series)	Books	2	3	13	N	Y	Not enough differences to make it interesting.	The book was far too similar to 'Ender's Game'. Bean's perspective was too introspective and not that interesting and my God was that Nun annoying.  The book could have been 100 pages shorter.<br />It is also evident that Card  is writing this book with an eye to even more un-necessary sequels. Too  many loose ends that I am not interested in following.	2000-01-17

See review below for &quot;Be Cool&quot; and note the address ... again!!!<br />Cheesy.<br />A reader from Haverford, Pennsylvania , February 28, 1999   Sharp, Witty and Cool  Another winner from Elmore. He is the  champion of great, witty, smart dialogue. Along with FRIED CALAMARI (which  also contains very sharp witty dialogue), this is the best contemporary  fiction I've read this year.	1999-03-24

I thought that &quot;Inside Out: A memoir of how wonderful myself and my friends were&quot; would have been a better title. An un-entertaining book with lots of name dropping.<br />I found it informative on neither Hollywood  nor the blacklist and got no feel for the era.<br />Why was the author a  socialist? He never gives a reason for his idealism , simply seems to have  gone along for the gag.	1999-02-25

This book not only told the incredible story of the most unlikely master criminal, Martin Cahill, it also depicted the underbelly of Dublin as I had never seen represented before.<br />Not for Maeve Binchey readers, this shows  a side of Ireland not usually represented in popular Irish fiction.	1999-02-24
