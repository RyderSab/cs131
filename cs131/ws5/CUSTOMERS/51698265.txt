Confidential.  Like that book this is a story about 1950's Los Angeles and about a set of very human LAPD officers.  One is a repressed homosexual investigating a series of grisly attacks on gays, another is an overweight hatchet man for Howard Hughes, and the third is an officer burying himself in his work to avoid the problems in his family life.  Circling this story is the 1950's Red Scare and the corruption in various parts of the LAPD. I liked seeing Dudley Smith in this story...those who have read L.A. Confidential will recognize him.  Ellroy has a unique writing style &amp; uses a lot of language that was commonplace in the 50's but is rather politically incorrect now...this adds to the realism. If you like crime/detective novels then give this one a try.	2001-05-30

This is the only vampire novel I've read that's come close to scaring me, and scare me it did.  I finished reading it for the 3rd time (the 1st was 15 years ago and I read it again 5 years ago) &amp; I finished it in two days. I think King's works from the 70's &amp; early 80's were by far his best stuff &amp; this is one of the great ones.  You have to try it for yourself to understand what a good storyteller he is.  King describes a typical small New England town with in-depth characters that slowly but surely begins to be colonized by vampires.  The story is so well written that it's quite believable...much better than anything I've read by Anne Rice.  There's a number of edge-of-your seat moments &amp; the climax is quite dark.  There's no total triumph of good over evil here...at the end you don't know if the vampires or the humans will ultimately prevail. If you haven't read King before this is an excellent place to start.	2001-05-30

I tried reading this book shortly after college in 1994 &amp; it didn't capture my attention then.  I reread it this year &amp; liked it much better.  I did find myself drifting a bit during certain passages...Le Carre is somewhat long-winded at points. The book does contain some funny British humor.  The story itself isn't all that exciting but it is a good mystery...we work along with Smiley to determine who the mole is.  Smiley is an interesting character...in addition to his spy work we also go through the pain of his wife deserting him for another man. I'll try reading some other Le Carre stuff...this wasn't bad at all.	2001-05-25

It doesn't contain as much right-wing diatribe as some of his others (as a Hollywood liberal I don't go for that stuff).  The plot is fantastic...a Middle Eastern group of terrorists discover a nuclear bomb in Syrian farmland and try to get it working again.  They set it off during the Super Bowl &amp; along with another terrorist group in Germany, try to trigger WWIII.  This is a scary part of the book as the US and then USSR go to the brink of nuclear war.  Jack Ryan is able to save the day...as much as this sounds completely sappy it actually works. If you're new to Tom Clancy you can start with this one...his other stuff is great, too but this is by far the best.	2001-05-25

I'm a Gen X'er who's been a big fan of video games his entire life (even now I'm constantly playing them on my PC &amp; I plan to buy an X-Box later this year) so this book certainly looked interesting to me when I bought it.  It is interesting, but rather poorly put together for a historical text. The book covers about a quarter century of video game technology, from the development of the first coin game, the first mass produced arcade game, the first home system, to where things are today.  There are lots of quotes from key people. My problem with the book is that there are several parts that made me think it wasn't edited well, if at all.  The timeline covered continually bounces back and forth rather than moving in a straight historical progression.  The author constantly refers to each system he describes as either &quot;the best-selling video game ever&quot; or &quot;the most popular video game ever&quot;.  After reading that a few times I couldn't tell what the popularity of a specific system was. Also there are some major historical holes that the book needs to fill; one of which is the collapse of the U.S. arcade industry.  That's what I wanted to find out about...why did the arcades die?  Although the author mentions the death of the arcade industry in a chapter there is no reason given for this event occuring.  In other words it is mentioned as a historical fact, but there is no research to back it up.  He also mentions several key video game designers &amp; executives in the book, but doesn't give a synopsis of who made it big financially &amp; who didn't. Overall if you like video games &amp; want to read about their history this isn't a bad book, but it's not great either &amp; I hope there are better ones out there.	2001-05-24

They both write these long, sweeping historical novels and this is the first one I've read by Rutherfurd.  I thought it moved more quickly than a Michener novel and contained less fluff.  I was able to get through the 900 pages without a problem while with other historical novels I sometimes find my eyes glazing over if the story gets off track with too much dialogue. If you like historical novels then give it a try.	2001-04-30

Gibson used a variety of technical terms that are only now part of our language, terms like &quot;microsoft&quot;, &quot;the matrix&quot;, and others.  I'm a big fan of &quot;The Matrix&quot; the movie and I imagine this could have been an inspiration for it.  The main character is a data thief who plugs into computer networks to steal information.  He spends the book hooking up with shady characters and avoiding shadier ones.  It is quick moving but can be a bit hard to follow (I glazed over a few pages when I lost attention).  If you like computers &amp; scifi you might like it.	2001-04-30

I'm really amazed at how good a writer Clive Cussler is.  I think he ranks up there with Stephen King and Tom Clancy in keeping the pages turning.  Every book reads like a James Bond novel and Dirk Pitt is a worthy James Bond.  It's pretty cool (a little silly sometimes, but still cool) that Pitt &amp; his comrades use a famous historical object in each novel to assist them in their mission.  Obviously in this one they use the Titanic to try to recover this rare chemical element buried in its vault to build a missle defense system. That idea doesn't sound too original today, but consider that this book was published in 1976, before the Titanic was found (Cussler includes a well-written forward about this) and before a missle defense system was discussed regularly by the government.  The point I'm trying to make is that the book deserves praise not only for a well written, adventurous story, but also for its originality.	2001-04-30

Definitely earns its rank as a classic	I read this book quickly on an overnight flight to Europe.  I found the description of the book on the back as well as on the website to be a bit misleading.  It's not so much about the discovery of Leibowitz's artifacts as it is about history repeating itself.  ...the story is split into 3 parts.  Part 1 takes place when society is recovering from a nuclear war &amp; is generally at peace.  Part 2 takes place when man is beginning to become bellicose &amp; fight amongst himself again.  Part 3 is a repeat of the age when nuclear war was about to break out.  The book contained a lot of religious stuff...I particularly thought the 2nd head that grew on the woman at the very end (I won't spoil it by giving the identity) was an amazing climax.  I'm not sure if the theme was that despite the best efforts of religion society will still find ways to destroy itself.  The theme of history repeating itself is a major part of the book. As a final comment I agree with another reviewer in being amazed that this book was published over 40 years ago. This book is typically listed as a top 100 scifi classic (that's how I found it) and I think it deserves that ranking. If you like scifi then give it a shot.	2001-04-30

A quick read that's quite enjoyable	I like historical fiction and this is my first venture into fiction involving the sea.  It's the first book in a 20-odd book series about a commander of a British vessel during the Napoleonic Wars and his associate, the ship's doctor.  This first book describes how Jack Aubrey becomes commander of a British vessel and the first battles he encounters. The book is interesting because there is so much detail about the Royal Navy.  The food they eat is described as well as the frequent punishments handed out to sailors for offenses such as drinking on the job.  It's a fictional book you can learn some naval history from too. I liked it and plan to read the others in the series.	2001-04-22

I liked it and was able to plow through its 1,230 pages within a few weeks.  The story is similar to Tai-Pan as it involves a taipan with a forbidden love interest.  It takes place in Japan in the 1800's and concentrates on the resistance/animosity the Japanese have to the colonial British.  There is not much for us to learn about Japan like we did in Shogun. I suppose the book could have been a bit shorter but I liked it just the way it is.  If you've read the 1st two books in the series I'll bet you'll like this too.	2001-04-22

This is the 2nd Elmore Leonard book I've read &amp; also the 2nd I've finished the same day I started it.  It's a quick read and as several comments below indicate it reads like a screenplay and is well suited for plane rides (or subway rides to Yankee games, like me).  The story is funny, quick-moving, and not too serious.  I do plan to read the rest of his novels after getting off to a quick start with this and &quot;Get Shorty&quot;.	2001-04-22

I liked the story and the ending was a surprise.  The details of drug-dealing and homicide investigation (the book involves both) are incredibly intricate and really add to the book's quality. The story did seem to drag on a bit though and that's why I only gave it 4 stars rather than 5.  Spike Lee's movie version is very good also.	2001-04-22

This was the first Asimov book I've ever read.  It was entertaining, but lacked the depth of a Ray Bradbury or Arthur C Clarke novel.  Basically the story was more there to entertain you than captivate you.  I am a big fan of Clarke's 2001 and Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and if you've read those you know what I mean by both of them having gripping stories.  This book wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I'll get around to reading the rest of the series at some point, but I'm in no hurry after reading this one.	2001-03-18

This is the 2nd book I've read by Harris, the first being &quot;Black Sunday&quot;.  I have to say this is quite an improvement.  There isn't a whole lot in here about Hannibal Lecter, so I was a bit disappointed.  I expected more development about him as part of the story.  The story itself is quite good and keeps the pages turning at the end.  However I'm not a big fan of Harris' dry writing style (the only character you really get to feel for is the Red Dragon himself) and so I didn't give it 5 stars.  I will read his other works soon, however.	2001-03-18

There, I said it and no, I'm not mentally unbalanced.  You may need to prepare yourself for negative comments from your peers when they find out you're reading this. The book is about a rich white snob who lives in Manhattan (where else?), works on Wall Street (although he never actually seems to do ANY work during the course of the book, a funny aside), wears expensive clothing, eats at expensive restaurants, dates high-maintainance women, and commits violent murders.  The book is funny because Patrick (the protagonist) commits his crimes randomly, interspersing the violence with his comments about business attire, cocktails, fine dining, and '80's music.  Another thing that makes the book so amusing is the fact Patrick fits in so well with his peers, even though he is a closet murderer.  Patrick continually comments to his &quot;friends&quot; about his nocturnal habits but they are so out of touch with everyday reality themselves that they pay no attention to him and he continues upon his killing sprees. Not much else to say except that if you like books that satirize yuppie lifestyles (Fight Club &amp; Bright Lights, Big City come to mind) then give it a try.  I read it in a day and a half. By the way the movie version was a disappointment.  If you read the book you can understand that it really couldn't be made into a quality movie.	2001-03-12

Well, Tolkien obviously has many many devotees and there are lots of reviews below mine, so I'll keep my comments brief.  I like this series a lot and this book is a worthy successor to &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;.  The only additional comment I'll make is that I like this series much more as an adult (I'm almost 30&quot; than I did as a child.  There is a lot of interpersonal interaction &amp; emotion and not so much swordplay &amp; action.  Consequently this series is certainly acceptable for children but I think it's more geared towards the adult reader.	2001-03-12

Well, I'll keep this short &amp; sweet.  I'm not much of a mystery reader but this series was recommended to me by several people.  I picked this one randomly to start the series.  I liked it...the story was quick-moving, had good character development, some humor, a lot of action, and tied up nicely at the end.  At 250 pages it's a quick read, perfect for an airplane ride. If you like Dick Francis, Robert Parker, et al, then you'll like this series.	2001-03-12

I liked it, but it lacked the power of the &quot;Rabbit&quot; series, the humor of &quot;Witches of Eastwick&quot; and &quot;Bech, a Book&quot;.  Since I'm not too familiar with Greek mythology I may have missed some of the references to Prometheus et al. That being said the book is an interesting story of a quirky teacher and his awkward relationship with his son.  The teacher is somewhat of a failure, at least professionally.  His students and his peers don't respect him, and his son spends most of the book trying to find a reason to respect him himself.  The story is interesting, but not deep enough to keep you engrossed as in Updike's other books.  I can't say much more except that if you like Updike books and have read several then give this a try.  If you haven't read him before please do not make this your first since it is the dullest of the bunch.	2001-03-12
US	51698265	R3I3QZV57UORE0	0312856644	379935465	The Incredible Shrinking Man	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Awesome classic sci-fi adventure.	I read this book in 5th grade, and reread it recently on vacation (I'm close to 30 now, uh oh).  It's the only Richard Matheson book I read and when I bought it again recently I was struck by the number of famous stories this guy has penned.  In this book, for instance, the short stories &quot;Nightmare at 20,000 Feet&quot; (a Twilight Zone classic), and &quot;Duel&quot; (an awesome action movie that I believe was one of Steven Spielberg's first movies) are included.  This guy also wrote &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, which was made into &quot;Omega Man&quot; with Charlon Heston, a sci-fi movie that I also like a lot. I guess what I'm trying to get at here is that this guy is a sci-fi/horror pioneer.  This story, although it's quite dated, is very well-written and compelling.  When I was younger I was very interested in the protagonist and his trying to survive the world as a steadily shrinking man (the battle with the spider and so forth).  As someone slightly older, I was more interested in his steadily deteriorating relationship with his wife, daughter, and coworkers.  They shun him, much like a leper or terminally ill person, since they cannot understand the illness he has. The story, if you don't know it, was original at the time but has been copied in several forms.  Basically the protagonist is a yuppie who is sprayed with a radioactive mist by accident and begins shrinking 1/7 inch a day.  The book switches back and forth between the last days of his shrinking life and flashbacks of his past. If you like sci-fi and horror by all means try it!	2001-03-12

There's a plethora of reviews below mine (this is a classic after all) so I won't bother going over the story or taking up a lot of space with my comments.  I will say this: I enjoyed this story a lot more now as an adult than I did back in grade school.  I think this is because Tolkien focuses more on the characters' minds and their interpersonal (or interhobbit) relations than on simple swordfighting and stuff.  The book concentrates on several human themes, most importantly being power and greed.  In the beginning when Bilbo doesn't want to give up his Ring, we can understand why.  We also understand how the Ring's evil power lead to the downfall of Gollumn.  (The Ring kind of reminded me of the corrupting influence of hard drugs, drinking, gambling, and other social vices).  The theme of despair is a big part of the story.  When the hobbits reluctantly enter the Mines to try to cut through the mountain range you can feel their fear.  The scene where they have to let one of their ponies go is a haunting one (&quot;Poor old Bill!&quot; is a line I'll remember) and you can really sympathize with these characters because they're not superhuman heros; they're everyday people (well, hobbits) in a tough situation.  The ending is extremely powerful where Frodo decides he must take the corrupting Ring away from his compatriots and strike out on his own.  When Sam catches up to him and heads off on this seemingly suicidal mission simply because he trusts his friend Frodo so much, it's a very moving scene.<br />I'd like to comment that I read Stephen Donaldson's 1st &quot;Thomas Covenent&quot; trilogy (Lord Foul's Bane et al) and I liked them as much as I liked these books.	2000-11-18

This is classified as one of Updike's short stories (check out his list of publications in the front) and as such is not a serious novel.  I have read plenty of his other works and no, this does not have the character depth or serious plot of the Rabbit series or his other books.  It is what it is: a very funny collection of stories about Henry Bech, an overweight 50'ish Jewish writer (there's some very good Jewish humor sprinkled throughout) currently suffering from writer's block.  He travels throughout the book; each chapter to a different place (The Soviet Union, the New England beach, a women's college in the Southern USA).  Women find Bech fascinating and he seduces several during the story (leading to some very funny scenes).  There's several Updike themes I found in his other books that make their way into &quot;Bech&quot;, but they are written to be humorous rather than serious (wife/mistress swapping, recreational drug use, worries about death/old age).  Updike's prose, as usual, is unbelieveably well written and makes the book worth reading by itself.  My advice is, try this book, don't take it seriously, and have a good laugh.  You may not want this to be your first Updike book; if you've never read him before I'd suggest starting with &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; and working your way through that 4-book series.	2000-11-18

Although these books aren't as good as Tolkien's &quot;Middle Earth&quot; series or Donaldson's &quot;White Gold Wielder&quot; series, they are very good all the same.  The adventure the characters go on is an exciting one.  The characters are interesting and likeable.  If you're a D&amp;D fan you'll appreciate these stories since they're based heavily on the game.  You'll especially appreciate the various monsters that are accurate to the D&amp;D rules (the blue dragon that breathes electricity, etc). I don't have too much else to say but if you like fantasy novels I recommend this highly.	2000-11-18

This book only added to my confusion about whether he's any good or just an also ran.  My feelings for this book started off positive, then dropped down so low I thought about giving up and tossing it aside at one point.  Finally, the ending was decent enough.  I planned on only giving it 1-2 stars when I was in the middle of it. Anyway, what's the problem?  The problem is the plot and Koontz's writing.  Sure the idea behind the story is neat. There was a nuclear holocaust long, long ago unbeknownst to present-day man.  These mutants, unimaginatively called &quot;goblins&quot;, had fought in the war and their decendants are now amassing weapons to cleanse the planet with fire yet again.  Only our protagonist, Slim, can see through these goblin's disguises and try to stop their evil plot. So although the basic idea is good the story repeats itself continuously, is unimaginatively written, and boring in several places.  Several hundred pages go like this: hero sees through goblin's disguise, hero tortures goblin to discover his evil plot, hero kills goblin with knife, hero has marital relations with his better half.  Stephen King's stories (at least his old ones) are much more captivating because they focus on the people in the story.  There is none of that here.  You never really get into the minds of the protagonists here and don't much care what happens to them at the end.	2000-11-18

I find it hard to believe this is also a Frank Herbert book, after reading the great &quot;Dune&quot;.  I understand the book is a collection of serial installments published in a scifi magazine, and that is exactly how it reads. There is none of the character development we find in the original except for the revived Duncan Idaho who struggles between two masters.  You never find out why he decides to stay on the side of Paul at the end, one point of the novel that I thought might be interesting.<br />There wasn't much talk about water this time either, one of the good parts of the first book.  It seemed like Arrakis was becoming more moist, people weren't hoarding water as much as they did in the first novel, but why?  Had some scientific plan for the distribution of the stored water in the cave gone into effect?  If this was discussed I missed it. At the end I was basically forcing myself to finish it.  I will read the rest of the series but I sure hope they're closer to the original than this book was.	2000-10-15

It covered  several interesting periods in Hawaii's history, including the arrival of  Catholic missionaries, the immigration of Chinese and Japanese,  the  unionization of the sugarcane workforce, the WWII period, and the drive for  statehood (I guess the book was finished before HI became a state).

You have to take this book with a grain of salt since it was written about  a quarter-century ago.  Dr. Cook spends a good deal of time on the  protagonist, a female medical student, trying to fit into the  male-dominated medical world.  I'm not saying that what he says has no  relevance to today's society, but since what he was talking about was  groundbreaking in the 70's it makes sense why he spends so much time on it.  I don't mean to imply this is a bad part of the book, in fact it is pretty  interesting. The story is quite good; a medical conspiracy where a famous  Boston hospital is selling human organs on the black market.  It is well  written &amp; keeps you on your toes.  I think Dr. Cook's novels get more  refined as time goes on, but &quot;Coma&quot; is an essential beginning  novel.	2000-09-13
US	51698265	REJG8ULLACX1H	0451170113	722345215	Night Shift (Signet)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	AWESOME!!!  Written in King's prime!	I'd like to give this book more than 5 stars if possible.  King is one of  my absolute favorite writers (I've read most of his books at least twice)  and this is one of his best.  It is a collection of short stories that  range from very good to great.  This includes some stories that were made  into movies, &quot;The Ledge&quot;, &quot;Children of the Corn&quot;,  &quot;Trucks&quot; as well as a few offshoots from his novels &quot;Salem's  Lot&quot; and &quot;The Stand&quot;.  One of my favorite stories here is  not a horror story, per se, but instead a very believable tragedy of  someone who commits the mercy killing of his cancer-ridden mother,   &quot;The Woman in the Room&quot;.  The way this story is written is  unreal; I mean you can totally understand what the narrator is feeling  (confusion, guilt, the desire to pull out at the last minute).  The  discussions he has with his brother, the memories of his Mom when she was  healthy, and the conversations he has with her in the hospital are so  realistic that the story hits you with a wallop.  It may not seem so  groundbreaking now, but imagine reading it when it was first published,  before the idea of using suicide as a way of ending terminal illness became  (partially) socially acceptable.  Another great story is &quot;Last Rung on  the Ladder&quot; which my girlfriend said almost made her cry; it's more of  a family drama than anything else.  The pure horror stories are great,  though, and are vintage King.  If you're new to his work here's a great one  to start off with!!	2000-09-05

I remember this book caused quite a stir in the late 80's.  Reading it now  I enjoyed it very much.  It's certainly not a defining, breathtaking, world  changing book (back then everyone was fawning over it)  but it is quite  good for what it is.  I don't think the point of the book was for you to  feel sorry for Sherman McCoy or anyone else for that matter, but simply to  see what can happen to someone who has his life utterly destroyed.  I like  these stories (check out &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;) and consequently I  liked this book.	2000-09-05

Since there are over 600 customer reviews listed below, I can't really say  much more than what other people have already said.  I am an adult who  likes fantasy &amp; scifi and I liked this book very much.  The story is  quick moving and wrriten with a sense of humor.  I liked the way it was  told in a storytelling fashion, as if it were being read to you. I plan to  read the other books in the series. I tried reading these books in the 4th  grade, but did not enjoy them as much as I am enjoying them now.	2000-09-05

I guess I shouldn't complain too much about Tom Clancy's books having a right wing bias.  After all, there are plenty of other good authors out  there who inject the opposite leanings into their works.  Since I'm  fashionably liberal myself, TC's political views tend to rub me the wrong  way.  Nevertheless, he still writes excellent thrillers, and Patriot Games  is no exception. If you're new to Clancy's books, this is a good one to  start with.  One reason his stories are so good is that he always has  things go wrong during tense situations.  Someone's key piece of equipment  fails or a communication is misunderstood, causing chaos.  This brings a  real-world flavor to his stories which make them quite believable. I  thought this book had a good story and was exciting to the end.  The  development of Jack Ryan as a character is well done and continues  throughout most of the other Clancy books.	2000-08-29
US	51698265	R2GBZ7HBEIRI8Y	0446674249	229538131	L.A. Confidential	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Great book, really well written.	This was my first book by James Ellroy, but it won't be the last.  The  story was well done.  I liked his quite-unique writing style and how he  based the book on a chronological timeline.  His writing is not for the  politically correct or easily offended as it includes lots of racial slurs.   That adds a sense of realism to the story, since it takes place in the  (much) less PC 1950's and is based on cop's lingo of the time.  Another  Ellroy trait I liked it that at numerous points during the story he  summarized where things were for the reader.  He did a good job of this,  not making it seem too obvious; normally these reports were presented as  newspaper clippings.  They were necessary since the plot is quite  intricate.  In short, L.A. Confidential was great and I look forward to  reading Ellroy's other mystery/thrillers.	2000-08-29
US	51698265	R1T998WPGASIA3	0671709453	851239785	Deep Six	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A great story and a whole lot of fun!	I hadn't read a Clive Cussler book for a few years and picked up  &quot;Deep Six&quot;.  I ended up tearing through it in a few days.  It  reminded me why I like his writing so much. Sometimes Cussler's stories are  a bit implausable, but they are a lot of fun.  Dirk &amp; Giordiano are a  great pair of super agents and their exploits are always thrilling.  Dirk  always comes through with a way of saving the world at the last minute and  gets the girl at the end, a la James Bond.  I look forward to reading some  more of Cussler's stuff. One last note, it's always neat (although  sometimes hard to believe) the way Cussler has Pitt use some object of  historical significance to help him out at the end; in this book he uses a  Civil War steamboat in a battle in the Gulf of Mexico.  These imaginative  ideas are what puts Cussler above the rest.	2000-08-29
US	51698265	R3OJZFJ8SDVWKQ	0451162072	639916239	Pet Sematary (Signet)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	One of my favorite King books.	I've read this book three times in the past 10 years.  I always remember  the parts that stick out, but there's enough detail included in the pages  that make each reading seem almost brand new. What can I say that hasn't  been said already?  The idea is original and actually quite believable, as  most King's ideas are (this is what helps make his 70's &amp; 80's books so  good).  The story moves along very quickly and bounces around from  character to character so you can't stop reading or get bored with what's  going on with one person. I also appreciate King's writing style and humor,  that wasn't as prevalent in his earlier works like &quot;Carrie&quot;.  By  this I mean all his quips about the &quot;Ramones&quot; and the  gravedigging jokes that have been thrown in to keep the writing fresh.   King also makes his characters seem very human.  The way he described the  Creed's family's grief about losing a child was realistic and made you  truly understand why Louis would want to chance burying him in the Micmac  ground. In short, there are a lot of horror writers out there but none come  close to Stephen King's: original ideas, believable plots, human  characters, and fast-paced story telling.  This is one of his best books  and one of my personal favorites of all time.	2000-08-22
US	51698265	RER8E1D4AULQ8	0374524122	603875347	Crash: A Novel	Books	2	1	4	N	N	Kind of dumb.	I bought this book for two reasons.  First, I like David Cronenberg movies a lot and I wanted to read this before I watched the film.  Secondly,  Ballard was recommended to me because I liked &quot;Fight Club&quot; and  other books of the genre.  I didn't like &quot;Crash&quot; a whole lot  though. Sure, the idea of people obsessing with the sexuality surrounding  car crashes is original, but it's a bit tiresome when it's dragged on for  200 pages (thank goodness the book isn't longer). I guess the book would  have been a lot better if it hadn't repeated itself so often.  I tired  after the fourth or fifth time the main characters had sex after either  causing a car crash, witnessing a car crash, or staging one. I gave this  two stars rather than one because it has potential to be a good book. I  don't know if I'll like Ballard's other works.  I also want to say the  Cronenberg film was pretty dumb too.	2000-08-18

I'll keep my review short &amp; sweet.  I really liked this trilogy a lot  and felt this book summed things up well.  I enjoyed the fact that a number  of characters from the past reappeared (Saltheart Foamfollower, Elena, etc)  to tie things up. This book/series is different than other fantasy novels  I've read because it has a lot of human emotion in it (despair) and also  ties in the present day world with the fantasy world.  In fact, even at the  end of the series you are not quite sure whether the events actually  occured to Thomas Covenent. My only complaint about the series is that,  although the themes of despair and fear are important to the story the  author spends too much time on them.  I also got a little sick about  hearing all the time how TC was a leper and why didn't everyone else  understand that.  This seemed to pop up every 10 pages or so. In any case,  I recommend this book &amp; the entire 1st Thomas Covenent trilogy  wholeheartedly.	2000-08-03
US	51698265	RVKFOHJQALTCW	0441172717	88529599	Dune	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Quite a sci-fi book.	This book is continually listed as a scifi classic.  After reading it for the 2nd time I wholeheartedly agree.  I read this for the 1st time about 10  years ago but I enjoyed the book much more now. This book is very original.   It covers the story of a planet being exploited for the Melange spice, a  slightly narcotic substance that is highly coveted across the universe.   Various families are fighting for control of the planet, which happens to  be a complete desert that it is very difficult to survive on.  The native  people work for whichever family controls the planet and are not treated  too well. This of course is a theme taken from the present-day world.   I  saw a lot of similarities between Arrakis (the planet) and various 3rd  world countries and between the Fremen (the native people) and various 3rd  world populations that are exploited for their countries' natural  resources.  The way they deal with this struggle is what makes the story  interesting. The science aspect of the story was well thought out also.  I  particularly found the ways that the Fremen controlled their water usage  interesting.  The plot moves along well with an exciting conclusion.	2000-08-03

This was the conclusion to one of the best fantasy trilogies I have ever read.  The reader really gets to know the major characters over the course of three books.  It's amazing how Donaldson tied them all together at the  end (having Saltheart Foamfollower skip book two, and having Elena appear  again in book three). The only complaint I have about these books is that I  got a little tired about hearing about the main character's problems with  leprosy.  He was always exclaiming &quot;I'm a leper, don't you  understand!&quot; every 10-20 pages or so and in a 1,500 page series it got  old pretty quickly.  I know the concept was important to the stories but it  was a bit overplayed. In terms of what I liked about the book: the story  was not entirely action-based,  it had a somber tone rather than the  typical &quot;happy-go-lucky&quot; tone of most fantasy novels,  I liked  the fact the main character wasn't able to use his power until the very end  of the series.<br />I'm looking forward to reading the other trilogy.	2000-08-01
US	51698265	R4QD8RY2GPBL2	0440206146	562316613	Black Sunday	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Not as good as I would have hoped for.	This was my first Thomas Harris novel and I didn't think it was all that great.  The story concept was original and the ending was suspenseful,  however the story didn't develop smoothly and the characters were very dry.   In that sense I mean you couldn't tell what their motivating feelings and  thoughts were, they just carried through their actions robotically.  If you  were to compare this to &quot;Sum of All Fears&quot; by Tom Clancy (simply  because they're both terrorism novels) you'd see what I mean.  The  characters there had motivation and you could understand where their  actions were coming from, and consequently I think &quot;Sum&quot; is a  much better novel. I'll probably read Harris' other stuff.  I imagine  &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; must be better than &quot;Black  Sunday&quot; since the film was so good, plus the novel came out later in  his career. As a final comment, I thought about giving this novel only two  stars, but the originality of the plot took it up a notch.	2000-07-18

I read most of Stephen King's books about 10 years ago in high school, and recently I decided to buy them all and read them again.  I started with &quot;Carrie&quot; since it was his first novel.  It is less polished than  his later works but he still has the same story flow that makes you keep  reading.  One thing I always liked about King's books is that he can change  back and forth between subjects without losing you, and by making you  interested in both of them.  For instance, in this book the constant notes  of the Carrie White commission provide premonitions of what is to happen  later. Overall, I still like King a lot, especially his stuff before 1990.   I'd recommend starting with this one if you haven't read his work before.	2000-07-16

I started off reading &quot;Spell for Chameleon&quot; and quickly grew to  like Piers Anthony's writing.  This book is good too, though it doesn't  have as exciting an adventure as the first one.  I like his humor (eye  scream, et al) and although it can get a bit corny it always makes me  laugh.

I'm close to 30 now, and I&quot;m kicking myself for not reading this series of books when I was younger.  I was turned off when I was a kid by the whole aspect of the present-day leper who journeyed via mysterious  means to &quot;The Land&quot;.  Now I can accept the plot more freely, and  what a great plot it is. I liked this book even more than &quot;Lord Foul's  Bane&quot;.  SD does a great job weaving this story into its predecessor's,  maybe because both were written in the same timeframe. I like these books  compared to most fantasy novels because they are very dark, and in this  sense, realistic.  Several protagonists have been killed off during my  journey through the series; something unusual for a fantasy trilogy.  This  makes the story more believable and more entertaining, since if everything  was &quot;happy go lucky&quot; I probably wouldn't find it too interesting.  As a closing note, I like Tommy Covenant since he is a person who has been  picked on and mistreated and yet rises to become a hero.  I compare him  with &quot;Neo&quot; of &quot;The Matrix&quot;.  He has been given this  great power he does not yet know how to control but he will learn it over  time and rise to the level of superhero. As a closing comment I'll make  sure to get a white gold wedding ring if/when I get married!	2000-06-18

I feel about the book the way I did about the movie; it would have been much better without the prostitute character.  Maybe it's because I'm a guy, and I can sympathize with the protagonist's (Ben's) plight. This book  was certainly an education in the life of an alcoholic.  From the different  sets of bars that open at different times, to the things you spend your day  doing when you're unemployed (game shows, etc) this book introduced me in  detail that a world I hopefully won't know, at least until I retire!  It  was a bit unnerving for me since the book make it easy to believe anyone  could fall of the edge of modern life and end up as an alcoholic. Easily  one of the best modern novels I've ever read.  I keep a copy on my  nightstand and regularly reread my favorite parts.  Probably one of the  reasons I like it so much is I'm fascinated with the concept of  self-destruction, which the book explores in detail.	2000-06-12

I believe it's more angled towards adults than towards children, and I appreciated it more now.The story is very  entertaining with some impressive plot twists.  Every character had its own  set of adult fears to face, which is what I think made this book  interesting.  Although this book seemed based more on human emotion than  anything else (Trent's insecurities and Bink's disappointment with the life  he knew) it had some neat fantasy/scifi references I appreciated (did this  book take place in Earth's future?

I loved this book and finished in within a week by puttingaside all my other reading.  I enjoyed the humor and as always, thedark twists of fate that befall Irving's characters.  Each Irving book contains main themes; the big ones here are rape, incest, and the family unit.  How someone could conceive of incest as a way to help a rape victim heal their wounds sounds incredible, but Irving pulls it off. There are several characters in the book that I couldn't help but chuckle at, like Iowa Bob and Egg.  One reason I like his books so much is because of the comic relief his characters provide.  Egg's deafness causing him to ask &quot;What?&quot; all the time was very similar to Homer Wells saying &quot;Right!&quot; all the time in Cider House Rules. Overall, I'd say this is my 2nd favorite Irving book behind Prayer for Owen Meany.	2000-03-20

I read it again a few years later and finished rereading for a 3rd time now.  It is, in a word, tremendous.  The story of a person stuck in the rut of middle-class life  who wants to escape to the excitement of his youth is a classic one, and  one many people can connect with.  Who hasn't thought about packing up,  quitting their job, leaving their family, and hitting the road for some  adventure?  That's exactly what Rabbit does and his journey is a  fascinating one.

Some parts  of this story are predictable to a point, but the magic spell which alters  the couple after Isabel's visit to the shaman throws a twist into things.   The ending was really something, with Tristao seeking a return to his roots  in the slums of Rio, but being defeated in the process. I finished this  book in less than two days...it's a quick read and isn't too lengthy.	2000-01-23

I had heard from friends that James Clavell was an excellent writer.  After finishing 'Shogun' I can certainly say I agree. The story itself never got dull during the 1100-odd pages.  There were many interesting  characters in the book, Blackthorne certainly being the key.  I liked  seeing how he at first resisted, then grudgingly accepted, then finally  adapted the Japanese culture as his own (the baths and the non-meat diet,  for example).  The social characteristics of 1600's Japan were captured  perfectly and were fascinating (seppuku, for example). The TV series was  before my time so I've never seen it.  It's hard for me to imagine any TV  program or movie doing justice to a story like this.	2000-01-22
US	51698265	RBOQMVZNNAGRA	0345387651	394884897	The Cider House Rules	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Another excellent Irving novel	This, my third John Irving novel, was yet another pleasant surprise.  I had purchased it awhile back but decided to read it now so I could still see the movie in the theater after I finished the book.  Contrasting the  two (although the movie was very good) made me appreciate Irving as a  writer even more because of the rich character development he wove into the  book.  For example, in the novel you get to follow the life events of Dr.  Larch for over 70 years! Irving's books are never 'cliffhangers' but they  are intriguing, mostly because you want to find out the fate of each  character rather than simply 'what happens' at the end. As a final aside,  it's simply incredible that someone could write a 600-page novel centered  around the theme of abortion and not once have it become long-winded or  boring!	2000-01-11

I like Tom Clancy overall and I did indeed like this book.  It contains the best and the worst elements of his writing.  The plot, as always, was intriguing and interesting.  I'm usually able to remember the details of  Clancy novels years after I've read them, and 'Without Remorse' will be no  exception. At the same time though, enough of the conservative ranting and  raving!  Drugs in the inner city and how they corrupt our innocent youth.   A girl victimized into becoming a prostitute, but saved (for a while) by  the main character's love.  The typical goody-goody theme that people of  different backgrounds CAN get along (like Clark and the doctor who runs  aground on his island).  Maybe it's just me, but I get enough of this  'big-hearted' stuff on TV. So yet again, another good book, but not a great  one.	2000-01-11
