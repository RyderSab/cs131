US	50993506	R1MQEHIOHMID77	0802845975	850543828	The Protestant Face of Anglicanism	Books	1	16	34	N	Y	Theological Iconoclasm	This book is a manifesto that intends \\"to restore the distinctly Protestant face of Anglicanism\\" (7), despite the fact that Anglicanism has always understood itself as a reformed Catholicism first, its relation to continental Protestanism being depending upon the former.  Zahl's attempted restoration aims for much, for it aims at undercutting the self-understanding that Anglicans have always had (regardless of the various shades of understanding that \\"catholicity\\" has embodied in Anglicanism - as in the rest of the Church); in short, Zahl attempts a complete recreation of Anglican identity.    The sources that he argues against throughout this work are predominately secondary sources (those that he dislikes the most are almost all found in a fairly thick volume titled The Study of Anglicanism) and his arguments are largely constructed by secondary sources against one another.  Such a method reflects neither a mature nor thoughtful scholarship but, instead, a rather peurile approach to a fairly significant claim: that Anglicanism isn't what we think it is.    One must wonder: why doesn't Zahl engage classic Anglican thinkers - as well as the medieval theologians and the Church Fathers?  He seems neither to know classic Anglican thinkers such as Richard Hooker and Lancelot Andrewes nor to know that these persons built upon a legacy of 1,500 years, for any engagement with Anglican theology must be an engagement with the Church Fathers and the medieval doctors, especially St. Thomas Aquinas (who, although he does not hold the place for Anglicans that he holds for Roman Catholics, is nonetheless quite influential).  Anyone can quote secondary sources, especially when they are all contained in a single volume!  It takes a far greater and far deeper level of reading to get into the very foundation of any theological movement for the foundation is what grounds the worldview.  It means getting into theologians as well as liturgies and hymns, art and poetry.  He does none ofthis.    Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, Zahl writes that Anglicans have never done any hard theological work.  Yet, this is clearly not the case: Richard Hooker's Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity was the greatest consideration of the nature of the Church during the Reformation; the King James Bible and the Revised Standard Version are both products of Anglicanism; Archbishop William Laud was a tremendous patron of the sciences; the great Catholic \\"revivals\\" (which Zahl has a clear dislike for) in the 19th century were initiated by scholars at Oxford and Cambridge; the late 19th century Biblical and Patristic scholarship of Bishops Westcott, Lightfoot and Hort is still used today; Archbishop William Temple and Austin Ferrar were both invited to give the Gifford Lectures in their lifetimes (and the Gifford Lectures are among the most prestigious philosophical lectures in the world); Evelyn Underhill's great work Mysticism quite literally recreated the field of religious studies in the early 20th century; C. S. Lewis was one of the greatest apologists of the 20th century.  To claim that Anglicanism lacks substantive theology or that Anglicans have never done any hard theological work fails to look at the facts.    Bizarre theological assertions further injure his case.  For example, he writes that creation \\"is not the starting point of Christianity\\" (73) - a point that is hard to square with the fact that the Bible not only begins with creation, but claims that creation is good.  It is this latter point, in particular, that has historically held a very strong place in the Christian imagination.  Against heretics on the one hand, who denigrated creation (especially the body) and against philosophers on the other hand who saw creation as an accidental emanation from God, the *ethos* that the first few chapters of Genesis gives is one that flies in the face of what Zahl wants to claim.    This repudiation of the goodness of the created order continues when he writes that \\"Theworld on its own terms is no canvass for a portrait of God that is either unified of compassionate\\" (74). The Psalmic (and therefore Patristic, medieval and Anglican) notion that \\"the heavens are telling the glory of God\\" is consequently repudiated.  Yet, Christians have historically believed that in addition to the Scriptures, one could turn to \\"the book of nature\\" and see something of God revealed there as well.  Although the latter has always been subsumed to the former, it has never been absent.  To undercut creation is to undercut the God that creates - and this is no small matter!    In repudiating so much of Anglicanism then, \\"the Protestant face of Anglicanism\\" comes across as being entirely out of touch with Anglicanism's 2,000 year history.  If this work is truly intended to \\"restore\\" something, one must wonder how this is going to take place as it seems both historically uninformed and theologically violent.  This is book that restores nothing but attempts to destroy much, and will therefore cause considerable confusion.  This is a book whose outlook will eventually destroy itself.	2005-10-10

It ought to be stated at the outset of this review what this  short book (only 88 pages of actual text; most footnotes are simply references in the original languages) is not: it is NOT a claim that Luther taught the doctrine of theosis - becoming a \\"partaker of the Divine Nature\\" (2 Peter 1:4) and therefore, \\"god\\" by grace - which is an Orthodox doctrine.  However, this particular study emerges from the interaction of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland's ecumenical conversations with the Russian Orthodox church.  Mannermaa's intent is to discover whether anything \\"analogous\\" to the Orthodox understanding of theosis (aka, \\"deification\\") in the theology of Martin Luther.  Mannermaa's answer is \\"yes\\".<br /><br />We should make another quick note; Mannermaa is researching the theology of Luther qua Luther - not Lutheranism, which he deems to have diminished the far more participatory elements in Luther's thought, especially since the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Christ Present in Faith was originally written over 20 years ago).  Mannermaa explores Luther's Commentary on Galations and, in a careful reading of it, presents Luther's thought on the union that each and every Christian has with Christ who is present in faith - that is, present in that he is the substance of our faith.<br /><br />What emerges is a view of Luther that loses none of its existential urgency - the individual self still stands as a sinner before God in desperate need of justification - but gains a very intimate sense of the presence of Christ.  The experience of faith is an experience of Christ; faith looks less like an individual choice than a yielding to the work of God in Christ and letting that within.  This yielding - this union - via faith/Christ effects a real change in the life of the believer such that there really is a new man within and, in this yielding, the new man comes to greater life while the old man is cut off more and more.<br /><br />There are some obvious ways that more catholic (I use the term broadly) readers would like to see Mannermaa go with this.  The sacramental and ecclesial expressions and nourishments of Christ present in faith are not paid a good deal of attention in Mannermaa.  Future books that look into these things will undoubtedly increase our understanding of the man who very unintentionally dismantled the Catholic West into Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Lutheranism and other various Protestants.<br /><br />There are, of course, some that will find Mannermaa's exploration far from satisfactory; those in triumphalist Reformation camps are likely to scoff at the notion of Luther wedding existential and mystical elements together, especially with an eye to the Eastern Orthodox.  Similarly some, in reading Mannermaa's short work, will argue with his method, particularly his desire to put Luther forward as a type of spiritual director (and therefore into an ecumenical place) as a radical distortion of the \\"principles of the Reformation\\".<br /><br />Yet, this is the stuff not only of theology but also of history.  Although Mannermaa concludes his work by noting that he has not claimed that Luther's theology is the same as that of the Orthodox, but that there are \\"analogous\\" notions in Luther to the ideas of participation in God and union with Christ, it ought be noted that his (Mannermaa's) work has been making waves for a number of years in a number of different circles.  Now that his primary work has been translated into English, there will probably be more waves made.  Well worth the read.ways that more catholic (I use the term broadly) readers would like to see Mannermaa go with this.

This two-volume set, however, is not a translation of Richard Hooker's Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity but is, instead, a complete commentary on it.  The first volume contains over 400 pages of essays (one on each book of Hooker's Laws), followed by a commentary on books I - IV.  The second volume contains a commentary on books V - VIII, a list of Scriptural passages cited and a lengthy bibliography.<br /><br />For those that are looking to get their hands on a commentary to Hooker's Laws, this is your one-stop shop.  This set is part of the Folger Library of the Complete Works of Richard Hooker, which is edited by some of the greatest living historians and theologians in the English-speaking Anglican Communion.  Therefore, if you are looking for a commentary, quite a lot of information on Hooker's theologya and on the early Church of England, this is your best place to start.  Hooker is portrayed in the essays and commentary as part of the reformed English Catholicism that begins, in many ways, with Thomas Cranmer and his arguments with Calvinists and Roman Catholics are discussed in minute detail throughout the commentary (as one might expect!).  In reading volume one alone, the average person (such as myself) is likely to learn as much about Hooker and company as s/he is ever likely to need to know.<br /><br />Sadly, if you are looking to purchase Hooker's Laws, you need to keep looking.  Besides the Complete Works available here on Amazon, there is a selection of the Laws in the series \\"Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought\\" and a modernized \\"translation\\" by Philip Secor of the most important section of the Laws (Book V) under the title \\"On Anglican Faith and Worship\\".  But, this two-volume set will certainly complement any library of Anglican thought, and is the most thorough introduction to Hooker's Laws that you are likely to find.s that you are likely to find.	2005-05-13
US	50993506	RDI00FDLSRKAY	0805202412	981966805	Illuminations: Essays and Reflections	Books	5	22	23	N	N	Brilliance	I picked up this book primarily for the purpose of reading Benjamin's critically acclaimed essay \\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\\", as well as for his darkly poetic - and even apocalyptic - \\"Theses on the Philosophy of History\\".  These essays are among Benjamin's most highly esteemed and are the last two selections in the book; regardless of whether you start with them or with the first essay, \\"Unpacking My Library: A Talk about Book Collecting\\", you are likely to be drawn into Benjamin's literary world quite quickly. <br /> <br />In many ways, Benjamin's writing style is quite unassuming; reading even his most profound insights is like reading a letter from an old friend.  His writing comes in layers; one must make time to savor his presence.  This book covers a range of subjects, from critical literary essays (the aforementioned \\"Unpacking My Library\\", as well as essays on Kafka, Baudelaire and Proust), to more hermeneutical reflections (\\"The Task of the Translator\\"), to straight up philosophy/theory (\\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\\" and \\"Theses on the Philosophy of History\\"). <br /> <br />The 51 page introduction by Hannah Arendt is absolutely fantastic.  It does not simply provide an overview of Benjamin's life, but sets that life within the culture of early 20th century Germany, focusing especially on the time between the two World Wars.  She notes the influences of Zionism and Communism (and Marxism) on Benjamin's thought, as well as the broader cultural influence of a quasi-secularized Judaism in a culture where non-baptized Jews were still kept out of university teaching posts.  Her introduction, like Benjamin's own writing, contains deep touches of the intimately personal (she selected the various essays that make up this volume). <br /> <br />In many ways, Benjamin was a deeply religious thinker.  A friend of Gershom Scholem's (the founder of the modern-day study of Jewish mysticism), Benjamin and Scholem corresponded for a number of years.  Although this particular volume pays little attention to his religious thought, \\"Theses on the Philosophy of History\\" (the final selection in the book which, in light of Benjamin's suicide, gives Illuminations a bit of a haunting finale), witnesses to Benjamin's poetic-religious insights: <br /> <br />\\"The soothsayers who found out from time what it had in store certainly did not experience time as either homogenous or empty.  Anyone who keeps this in mind will perhaps get an idea of how past times were experienced in remembrance - namely, in just the same way.  We know how the Jews were prohibited from investigating the future.  This stripped the future of its magic, to which all those succumb who turn to the soothsayers for enlightenment.  This does not imply, however, that for the Jews the future turned into homogenous, empty time.  For every second of time was the strait gate through which the Messiah might enter.\\" <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-05-11

In the foreword to this wonderful collection of Anglican spiritual writings, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams states two things: first, that it is intended to be something of an enchiridion - a handbook or manual - of the Anglican faith and second, the desire that it will be instrumental in leading to a renewal of Anglican theology.  Perhaps this second point that will strike some people as odd, but in reality Williams is only noting what others before him (such as one of Williams' predecessors, Michael Ramsey) have noted: since World War II, there has been a real loss of Anglican identity.  It is precisely because of this loss of identity that a handbook for instruction in the faith is needed.  Love's Redeeming Work accomplishes this quite admirably.<br /><br />First, there are over 700 pages of source material.  Each author or selection is prefaced with relevant dates (including birth and death), a brief summary of their accomplishments and any other relevant data (such as forced exile, martyrdom, marriage, controversies, etc.).  It is fascinating to read about some of the great heroes of Anglicanism fighting and arguing with each other, or being influenced and taught by each other; one can go back and forth between these authors and get a feel for really being in the midst of historical development.  Every selection for each author is also referenced so that if one desires to pursue further reading of an author one may do so (assuming, of course, that one can get one's hands on the originals which, in many cases, is sadly doubtful).<br /><br />Second, the book is divided into three main time periods, each of which begins with an essay on the historical and theological development of the era.  The essays are absolutely first rate (which is of no surprise, given that Rowell, Stevenson and Williams are all theologians and historians that orbit a high sphere all their own) and provide a substantive amount of background material.  Again, reading back and forthbetween different authors and noting the influence over time of different persons on each other is a wonderful way of getting into the historical development of Anglicanism; fortunately this book is arranged in such a way that this is made quite possible.  Reading the selections in order gives one view; dipping into different selections gives another view that is no less complementary.  The chronological arrangement of authors fosters the helpfulness of both.<br /><br />One thing that one will see as one reads through this is that Anglicanism has a wide variety of streams in it.  From early Protestant streams that did not seek to divide the church from its catholic past so much as to offer a reform of the excesses of the late medieval Western church, to those that would be far more Calvinist in their views, to those that would be more far more medieval in their aspirations: all of these are found in Anglicanism.<br /><br />Furthermore, as one gets away from the motherland (England) in the 19th and 20th centuries, one begins to see some of the ways that Anglicans have both engaged and been engaged by cultures from all around the world.  This volume, in fact, is the only place that one is going to find many primary documents on the development of Anglicanism as a world communion: India, Africa and Southeast Asia are all represented in this collection.  This is incredibly refreshing as there is much talk about global Anglicanism (especially its being more conservative) but next to no primary sources available; this volume offers a significant corrective to that absence.<br /><br />Living authors such as Desmond Tutu, Rowan Williams and N. T. Wright are not included in this collection.  It would be fascinating to see this collection updated in a generation to see who would be included (the aforementioned surely would be).  However, as a reader in Anglicanism - including some liturgical texts, for that matter - it functions magnificently.  It does a tremendous job revealing how Anglicanism - the third largest Christian church in the world - has come to be.  And, hopefully, in fostering the memory of what has come before, it will be influential in shaping where Anglicanism goes from here on out.  For all interested in Anglicanism, this is a volume that can truly be called \\"indispensable\\".	2005-04-13
US	50993506	RSNIMEVB2CNBN	0872431398	585460864	The Anglican Spiritual Tradition	Books	5	24	31	N	Y	Anglicanism as Religious Spirituality/Spiritual Religiosity	The title of this book may very well mislead a number of persons.  \\"The Anglican Spiritual Tradition\\" is very much about Anglicanism, but it is not about \\"spirituality\\" at the expense of history and theology - it is not about spirituality without religion.  Rather, Anglican spirituality *is* Anglican religion, just as Anglican religion *is* Anglican spirituality.  Thankfully, Bishop Moorman avoids this all-too-popular Gnostic split between time (ie, religion) and the eternal (ie, spirituality).<br /><br />The Anglican Spiritual Tradition begins on the eve of the Reformation.  One of the things that Moorman does well is to note how utterly chaotic the Reformation was on laity, priests, bishops and archbishops - each in their own unique way.  Rather than writing a history of Anglican religion-spirituality from the top (ie, dealing with the great theologian-mystics and leaving it at that), Moorman catalogues the various ways that all members of the English church were effected and the ways that their interactions with each other shaped Anglicanism.  In many ways, Moorman's history is a social history; it is a welcome departure from the \\"great man\\" approach (for me, at least).<br /><br />Moorman begins at the eve of the Reformation, moves through the English Reformations under Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth and the on into the Anglican Divines.  He pays special note to Richard Hooker, oftentimes called the \\"prophet of Anglicanism\\", and to the development of Anglicanism as the via media (Latin for \\"middle way\\") - not out of complacency, but out of necessity!  Puritanism/Calvinism was seen as being just as dangerous as Roman Catholicism and the \\"via media\\" was about steering in between dangerous excesses.  Anglicanism is seen here as to really be able to make good on its claims to be part of the \\"one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church\\" (as the Nicene Creed puts it).<br /><br />Moorman is not afraid to reveal some of the odder, more radical discontinuities between those \\"up top\\" in the episcopacy and the laity, though.  He discusses William Laud's catholic revivals side-by-side with the influence of Puritan writings such as John Bunyan's The Pilgrim Progress.  Moorman discusses John & Charles Wesley's very catholic evangelicalism, with its high sacramentality wed to the Protestant experience of being justified in an existential moment immediately after, revealing how antitheses may very well lead to some wonderfully fresh syntheses.<br /><br />It is the 19th century Oxford Movement that is next on Bishop Moorman's list of topics.  He details a number of the liturgical shifts that came about with this movement, as well as some of the retrievals (or, attempted retrievals) of medieval catholicism as being a part of the Anglican imagination.  One of the things that is done really well with this book is the noting of how liturgical developments often reflected changing attitudes and further served to change attitudes; a reaffirming of historic tradition among the laity was one of the ways that the Oxford Movement changed Anglicanism.<br /><br />Moorman does a good job of chronicling the developments in Anglicanism up through the middle of the 20th century, but it is perhaps here that the greatest fault of the book lies: not nearly enough attention is paid to the development of Anglicanism as a truly multi-cultural communion.  Moorman focuses his energy primarily on the Church of England and, although the CofE is at the heart of the Anglican Communion, it is not - and even back in 1985, when this was written, it was not - fully reflective of the wider trends in Anglicanism.<br /><br />However, in the end, this book should still be given 5 stars since it is a one-of-a-kind work.  Nowhere else is Anglicanism's spirituality - its lived religiosity - detailed in its historical advents with as much attention paid to the utterly social nature of its developments.  Understanding the liturgical, theological, social, and cultural elements of Anglicanism as a primarily English phenomena (early on!) will give any and every person interested in her history a solid foundation on which to continue studying.  Highly recommended.	2005-03-28

Deny this, and you must say that humanity or the human good is, in some significant way, within our power to determine: which may sound emancipatory for a few minutes, until you remember that, in a violent and oppressive world, it is neither good news nor good sense to propose that definitions of the human lie in human hands, when those hands are by no means guaranteed to be the instruments of a mind formed by contemplative reason - or even what passes for reason in the liberal and universalist ethos of 'our' democracies.\\" <br />- p. 55 <br /> <br />\\"...theological language is a difficult, always incomplete, corruptible, but unavoidable enterprise, pressed into existence by the particular character of what God is perceived as doing, by the sense of a givenness or gratuity bearing on the human situation in such a way that a difference is made that demands new words and concepts.\\" <br />- p. 108 <br /> <br />What Williams most seeks to do here - as in other places - is to enter into a charitable dialogue with some of the important - even if not necessarily great - Anglican voices of the past.  This charitable dialogue is not without criticism at points; but equally, it is not without appreciation.  Reading Williams reading others is like watching someone look into a photo album and pull out all sorts of interesting bits about *us* and where we are at today by noticing the style of bicycle that the child in the photo is riding or the type of dress that a woman is wearing *then*.  This is a book to go back through more than once. <br /> <br />There are eight chapters in the book: <br /> <br />1. Williams Tyndale (1491 - 1536): The Christian Society <br />2. Richard Hooker (1554 - 1600): Contemplative Pragmatism <br />3. Richard Hooker (1554 - 1600): Philosopher, Anglican, Contemporary <br />4. George Herbert (1593 - 1633): Inside Herbert's Afflictions <br />5. B.F. Westcott (1825 - 1901): The Fate of Liberal Anglicanism <br />6. Michael Ramsey (1904 - 1988): Theology and the Churches <br />7. John A. T. Robinson (1919 - 1983): Honest to God and the 1960s <br />8. B.F. Westcott (1825 - 1901), E.C. Hoskyns (1884 - 1937), William Temple (1881 - 1944) and John A.T. Robinson(1919 - 1983): Anglican Approaches to St. John's Gospel <br /> <br />Williams is quite aware that this is by no means a complete list of the manifold Anglican identities that have existed and continue to exist in our world.  Yet, there are a lot of contours and trajectories here that ought not be missed and can, in fact, be found to emerge as one goes through different Anglican thinkers. <br /> <br />As one may notice in the above list of chapters, Richard Hooker - perhaps rightly thought of as the theological father of all later Anglican writers - makes *two* appearances here.  Williams writes that \\"Hooker - like the Anglican tradition as a whole, it is tempting to add - is tantalizingly hard to pigeonhole.\\" (p. 55) Yet, I wonder if perhaps this is only because we have become too used to hearing a polemic between radical Protestants on the one hand and ardent Roman Catholics on the other - as if this truly represented the spectrum of Christendom!  Anglicanism, as an attempting *for* a primitive (= historic!) catholicity, deconstructs the oftentimes elaborate over-simplifications made by both Puritans and Roman Catholics on issues such as Scripture, grace and the Church, therefore standing as a viable third option: as something *distinctly* Anglican. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-02-26
US	50993506	R1Y67EEE70I9BL	0281054401	530795284	Lancelot Andrewes - The Private Prayers (Golden Age of Spiritual Writing)	Books	5	13	13	N	Y	Poetry for God	Lancelot Andrewes was one of the great figures in the Church of England after the Reformation.  One of the key figures in the translating and editing of the King James Bible, he was also a great theologian and, as this collection reveals, a great poet as well.<br /><br />Andrewes' poetry is rich with Scriptural quotations and allusions.  Not only does he quote the Scriptures, weaving them seamlessly into his poems, but the poems themselves breathe a certain Biblical life that can only come about through a substantial engagement with the Biblical texts themselves.  The Psalms, in particular, seem to have resonated deeply with Andrewes.<br /><br />The most unique - and oftentimes the best - sections of his poems are those where he takes disparate Scriptural quotations and weaves them together into a poem or stanza.  David Scott, who translated and edited these poems, has been gracious enough to list direct Scriptural references and this is particularly helpful when Andrewes' poems weave snippets of the Psalms, Gospels and other text to \\"create\\" a prayer that is at once his and others'.<br /><br />Given to a post-Reformation English sensibility, however, the creeds, sacraments and liturgies of the Church also bear heavily upon the poems present here.  Several of the poems are poetic rephrasings of the Nicene and Apostles' Creeds; the liturgy of the Prayer Book also saturates many of the poems present, revealing that Andrewes not only participated in the liturgy, but let it inform his thought and living in some very deep and spiritually significant ways.<br /><br />My only complaint with this edition is that Scott does not explain the layout of the poems.  The poems are printed as combinations of columns and brackets, sometimes centered in the page and oftentimes spaced out in unusual ways.  This does let the poems take on a level of meditative meaning - the text does, quite literally, take you outside of yourself - that they would otherwise not have.  But, did Andrewesoriginally write his poems this way?  If so, they show him to be a creative genius, using the layout of the poems as a medium in addition to the words themselves (and it works wonderfully well!).  The late deconstructionist Jacques Derrida, who attempted to disrupt the flow of printed text by laying out the text/s in his books in new ways, is shown to have little creativity when it comes to the layout that Andrewes(?) gave to his own poems.<br /><br />For those familiar with the Anglican tradition, they will find much to savor here and much to admire as well: Andrewes is among the greatest Anglican thinkers ever.  Those who are foreign to Anglicanism would do well to investigate this book as an entry into some of the larger contours of Anglican spirituality.  Regardless of who you are, you do well to let these private prayers enrich your own prayer life and, in reading them, let them take you outside of yourself to the God who gives poetic imagination.	2005-01-04

So, one will read in the notes references to something such as the Gospel of Thomas, early Christian writings and Rabbinic literature, Babylonian creation accounts, etc.  The goal of this is not to erase theological understandings of the texts of the Bible, but to place the texts themselves in their original context and let them speak with their own voice as much as possible.<br /><br />In this way, then, the NRSV is a very Protestant Bible.  In keeping with its Protestantism, not only is the Old Testament in this Bible the same as the traditional Protestant Old Testament (39 books), but following Luther and later Protestant editions of the Bible, the \\"Apocrypha\\" (an intentionally disparaging term when originally used, which means \\"hidden\\" or \\"esoteric\\") - the books in the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Old Testaments that were never included in the Jewish Bible and were then thrown out of the Protestant Old Testament during the Reformation - are included *between* the Old and New Testaments.  Breaking with Protestant anti-Catholicism, however, these books are in no way disparaged but are, instead, recognized by the editors of the NRSV as being accepted as Scripture by a great number of Christians (more Christians accept these books, in fact, than dispute them).  To not understand the Apocrypha is to miss out on a huge amount of the larger Biblical world!<br /><br />The second major reason why I would buy this Bible is due to the fascinating historical essays that open each of the three sections - Old Testament, Apocrypha and New Testament - which are wonderfully helpful for understanding the larger theological canvas that the Scriptures have occupied for Jewish and Christian communities.  There are several tables that note the differences between the major canons - Jewish, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Protestant - and in reading these, it becomes clear that books are placed where they are in the Bible for specific theological reasons (the book of Daniel, for example, is considered by Christians to be a prophetic work but not so by Judaism, hence its exclusion from the Prophets and inclusion in the Writings section of the Jewish Bible).<br /><br />As with many study Bibles, this edition contains maps and diagrams interspersed throughout the text.  Manuscript variances are noted clearly but unobtrusively throughout the text as well and the notes are helpful on historical, literary and linguistic lines.  Each book contains an introduction, some of which are quite extensive and all of which are, like the other study aids, quite helpful.<br /><br />It should be noted that unlike many Bibles, this Bible is neither translated nor annotated on a middle school (or lower!) reading level.  For those that are genuinely serious about Bible study, though, I can think of no better Bible to begin - and end - with than this edition.	2004-12-14

The papers collected in this volume are from a symposium held in Rome in 2002 on Anglicanism and the Western Christian Tradition (that is, Roman Catholicism); the subtitle of the conference was \\"continuity and change\\".  What the papers basically do is detail the ways that Anglicanism developed during and after the English Reformation - or, as several authors persuasively argue, the English Reformations.  Disappointingly, little attention is paid to the ways that Roman Catholicism has also developed since the (so-called) \\"Reformation\\"; hence, the reader finishes the book with only an understanding of certain facets of Anglican history.    The book begins with two essays on the English Reformation, noting how - at points violently! - iconoclastic the Reformation in England was.  Contrary to popular, received wisdom that the English Reformation was simply a reforming of Catholicism, both Diarmaid MacCulloch and Eamon Duffy write that had Queen Elizabeth not stopped the trends in the country toward Calvinism and insisted on creating a national church in which both the Catholic and the Reformed would exist side-by-side, Anglicanism likely would have ended looking far more like Calvinism than Roman Catholicism.    The Calvinizing trends did, of course, result in a very Catholic response - that is, a response from those within the Church that felt that while the Church did need to be reformed, it also needed to stay away from the extreme Protestantism that centered in Geneva.  This, then, was the brilliance of Richard Hooker, who in many ways invented what is now Anglicanism - the \\"via media\\".  At the very least, he became the most significant mouthpiece for a Reformed Catholicism.  Of course, it is true that this Reformed Catholicism all too often did not satisfy those that were interested in being only Reformed or only Catholic.    Strangely, the 17th and 18th centuries are entirely ignored!  The book immediately jumps to the high-church Oxford Movement, which ended whenits head John Henry Newman and others in it defected to Rome.  This is the longest chapter in the book, being over 50 pages.  Its author, Peter Nockles, focuses largely upon Newman but notes the importance of other thinkers such as John Keble and Edward Pusey.  Nockles notes the selectivity of the Oxford Movement as they attempted to create a tradition of Anglicanism, moderating the very Calvinist trends of Cranmer and company during the English Reformation while emphasizing the far more Catholic elements of Hooker, Lancelot Andrewes and others.      It is here, then, that I wish to point out my caveats with this book (although I do think it is a *great* read): not enough focus on Anglican *theology* and *liturgy*.  Nockles seems bothered by the fact that the Oxford Movement was selective in its construction of Anglicanism's history - yet, this is exactly what tradition *is*.  Certain things are accepted and other things are left out.  It might be true that Anglicanism is really not nearly as seamless as the singularity of the very word \\"Anglicanism\\" implies.  Regardless, there are still trends and this book simply doesn't connect the dots.    Second, it would have been welcome - frankly, it is necessary - to explore the place of Cranmer's liturgy and how that has shaped Anglican understanding.  Why the use of certain Eastern Orthodox practices in the Anglican liturgy?  When did was communion opened to all the baptized during Anglican eucharist celebration?  While essays here do touch upon the arguments over how \\"Popish\\" the liturgy should or should have not been in the eyes of different groups, an essay that looked at the embodied practice of Anglicanism in its liturgical celebration would have been quite welcome.    The last essay is a short but fascinating essay on Anglicanism's global expansion due to both English colonialism and non-colonial missionary work.  What global, post-colonial Anglicanism will look like is really anybody's guess; William Jacobs chartsthe historical evolution of Anglicanism as a primarily English phenomenon to a global church that tries to engage local particularities with openness.    The question of \\"What *is* Anglicanism?\\" seems to be taking a back seat these days to \\"What, if anything, will Anglicanism *be*?\\"  Regardless of how one answers this question, this book does an excellent job in presenting some of the main lines of the socio-historical development of Anglicanism up through the end of the 20th century.  Perhaps at some point, this volume might be accompanied by another volume which traces the history of *Roman* Catholicism during the same period.    Regardless of my caveats, due to the impeccable historical scholarship of these authors I highly recommend this book to all Christians that are concerned with the meaning of \\"Christian\\" and the histories that both unite us and, sadly, keep us apart.	2004-11-30
US	50993506	RQSIFBVOWH1D7	1596280042	19844108	The Anglican Spirit: Seabury Classics	Books	5	36	36	N	Y	An Excellent Introduction	Rowan Williams, the current Archbishop of Canterbury, notes in his foreword that this is a book that is really needed right now.  Given that tensions in the Anglican Communion have been increasing for quite some time and that they are now at the point where the Anglican Communion is likely to change in some significant and painful ways over the next few months, it is well worth looking back and seeing something of what others (particularly the heroes of the past!) saw when they looked at Ekklesia Anglicana.<br /><br />This work is a short one.  Compiled from class notes and given Ramsey's editorial approval, the chapters that make up The Anglican Spirit come across as quite conversational - much as if one were sitting the classroom where Ramsey first delivered these.  In short, Ramsey gives a quick tour of the history of Anglican thought and practice while giving a bit of theological commentary on the side: criticisms, critiques and approvals.  He brings out things that one would likely not know if one were not an expert and well trained in the history of Anglican thought - again, giving the book a conversational tone while sacrificing none of its content.<br /><br />One is left with a sense that Anglicanism does have a grounding in Scripture, Tradition and Reason - that, contrary to what many think, one may really speak of an Anglican spirit and an Anglican thought process.  Anglicans, like other Christians, hold the Scriptures in the highest regard and they believe that the Scriptures must be read not only in the light of higher Biblical criticism, but through the light of the many different thinkers of the Church, especially the creeds and the first four Ecumenical Councils.  Ramsey notes that these four have always been authoritative for Anglicans in a way that the last three Ecumenical Councils were not - not that they were or are wrong, but that they never had a grip on the Western (Anglican, Roman Catholic and Protestant) imagination as a whole.<br /><br />Perhaps more difficult, though, is the idea that \\"reason\\" - the bogeyman of so much contemporary thought - ought to play a part in the Christian life in general, and the Anglican life in particular.  Ramsey does not propose that one ought to disregard the past in light of new cultural configurations, but that one must ask one's self - the Church must ask itself - how the Gospel is to be given in such a way that its relevancy is seen in a particular culture.  This is not watered-down relativism, but an honest and forthright approach to reading both Scripture and Tradition in light of one's contemporary situation.<br /><br />It would have been welcome to read a chapter on how exactly the Church is to use Reason to engage a particular culture, but Ramsey doesn't touch upon this (perhaps it was not as urgent an issue when this book was first put together a good 13 years ago).  Yet, perhaps there is an answer in his ecclesiology.  He proves quite prophetic at points, particularly when he discusses unilateralism in the communion and how dangerous it is not only to Anglicans but to all Christians.  One can - and should - ask whether or not this means that Ramsey refuses to let a given culture be self-justifying; it is worth reading his chapter on the church and noting what he doesn't say as much as what he does say.<br /><br />Yet, when he discusses the relationship of Anglicanism to the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, he notes that Anglicanism does not exist for itself and that perhaps the time will come when it will have to dissolve to make way for a greater good in the Church catholic.  While very few would want to see this happen, one must admit that it takes a good bit of humility to write this sort of thing, especially since Ramsey was the Archbishop of Canterbury at a truly revolutionary time in both global Christianity and world history.<br /><br />Hopefully these latter words of Ramsey's will prove to be less prophetic and more along the lines of a warning, not unlike the recent Windsor Report.  Of course, only time will tell.  In the time between, however, this is an excellent introduction to the spirit of Anglicanism by someone who truly was one of Anglicanism's greatest spirits.<br /><br />[This book is perfectly complemented by Mark Chapman's [[ASIN:0192806939 Anglicanism: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)]].]course, only time will tell.

US	50993506	R38JMZS1CEMHZ2	0881412406	440714086	On God and Christ: The Five Theological Orations and Two Letters to Cledonius (St. Vladimir's Seminary Press) (St. Vladimir's Seminary Press: Popular Patristics)	Books	5	56	58	N	N	Thinking Outside of Time: Well Worth the Effort	This book was a difficult read.  As these orations were, most likely, sermons, I was expecting them to be far easier to understand than they were; I was expecting some sort of catechetical-like introduction to the Trinity.  What I got was, in fact, far more difficult but no less profound; this is also a highly profitable read.   <br /> <br />Nazianzus lived during a period of great theological controversy and turmoil.  Although Christianity was now the official religion of the empire, it was by no means clear what the official doctrine/s of Christ and God were.  There were many schools of thought on point, many of which tended in similar directions.  Yet, the finer points of Incarnation and Trinity were much debated, particularly the relationship of God the Father to God the Son and, interestingly, this was not merely a matter for cloistered scholars: it was something that everyone had an opinion about and if Christianity was going to be the glue that held people together, it was going to have to figure out just what the Trinity (and by extension, the Incarnation) meant. <br /> <br />The Theological Orations are Gregory's attempt at working out what exactly the Trinity means.  So, these works are at points highly polemical against \\"heretics\\" (whomever they were); there is no room for even an iota of untrue (or half true) doctrine.  Several of the Orations are set up as Q & A sessions in which Gregory refutes certain theological positions that he sees as relegating Christ to a position below the Father and, therefore, destroying the Trinity. <br /> <br />Gregory makes a number of key points, the first of which is that theology is not for everyone (!): rather, it is only for those who are really open to God and willing to not merely discuss God, but also to let God defy the language that they use to discuss Him with.  So, for Gregory, \\"negative\\" and \\"affirmative\\" theology are \\"braided\\" together into a seamless unity.  In speaking of God, one speaks of a God that overflows our speech.  Yet, what one says is, if orthdox, also objectively true. <br /> <br />Secondly, if one wants to speak of God - and God is One in Three persons, the Trinity - then one must speak and think *outside* of time.  This is no small or easy task!  Yet, if one wants to speak of the Father as being the fount of the Trinity, and also at the same time affirm the eternal existence of the Son and the Spirit, one cannot speak of \\"generation\\" in any way that is similar to how we must think of what it means \\"to generate\\", which is done in and through time.  The eternal, then, is not the supra-temporal, but rather the atemporal. <br /> <br />It is all quite mind-defying, really.  Regardless of whether or not one finds all of Gregory's arguments or all of his scriptural exegesis to be convincing (I didn't, and I doubt that anyone else will find *all* of it convincing), he says much that does not simply make one think but that also takes one outside of and beyond the limits of the mind and its linguistic articulations.  It is a holding together of seemingly irreconcilable ideas: the eternal and the language of relationship, which is rooted in the temporal.  Yet, such is theology.  It is not confusing if one lets it open one's self up to that which is beyond all of our words.  If one tries to keep something such as the Trinity - God! - *trapped* within our logic, then one is likely to be not only frustrated but also confused.  This is, of course, what Gregory warns against in the first Oration: if you aren't ready to let God be God, then don't talk about God! <br /> <br />If you want to sit down and really wrestle with a text on the Trinity, this is a great place to go.  Not only is it a classic and foundational text on the trinitarian life of God, but it *should* also open one up to a God whose life is relationship - the relationship of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit - but whose relationship equally defies our rationality.  I really think that there is something ofa window to God here, and it is a window that is well worth looking through.  Is it the whole picture?  Of course not.  But, it directs you to what you ought to be looking at - and that *is* what theology can *does*.  Highly recommended.	2004-10-27
US	50993506	R34G3O3EU0FL2D	0385500920	463676104	The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality	Books	5	15	16	N	N	For Pilgrims on the Way	I have never, to the best of my knowledge, ever declared a book to be an \\"instant classic\\"; this book is no exception.  However, I do think that the contents of this book are utterly classic: pristine, vintage and eternal.  Although The Mountain of Silence may not be The Way of the Pilgrim for the 21st century, for those that are seeking to further their knowledge and experience - those seeking to continue the marriage of their heart with their mind - I think that this book is not merely accessible: it is also authoritative. <br /> <br />In short, Markides is a sociologist at the University of Maine.  He was raised Greek Orthodox but wandered away during his secular training and, like many, sought greater spiritual wisdom in the Far East.  It does not seem that Markides ever quite found all that he was looking for, but the \\"supernatural\\" things that he witnessed in his travels opened him up to thinking that there was something more than the reduction to socio-cultural being that his sociological training gave to him. <br /> <br />Enter Fr. Maximos, a now-exiled monk from Mt. Athos who is in Cyprus to bring about spiritual renewal.  He was forced to leave Mt. Athos by his spiritual guide, the Elder Paisios and ordered to return to Cyprus; such is the wisdom of God, it seems.  Markides, then, spends time with Fr. Maximos and records his wisdom and spiritual insights, and not always without a little doubt.  Markides has not exactly returned to the Orthodox church, but remains something of a prodigal, with and without a home.  Yet, Markides is open.  His doubts are honest, but they are not solely doubts about Orthodox faith - they are also doubts about the shortcomings of Western science, something that he seems to share with many, particularly of the baby boomer generation.  One of the most enjoyable elements of the book is reading Markides as he bares his soul and openly wrestles with his questions.  It takes a good bit of humility to do so, and humility, according toFr. Maximos is the first step on the spiritual path. <br /> <br />Get ready for something that is going to come completely out of left field, though.  Fr. Maximos is a part of a living tradition that is open to the workings of God in sometimes strange ways: prophecy and words of knowledge, visionary experiences and embodied appearances of saints and even Christ!  Although for some of the more charismatic/Pentecostal churches much of this may seem typical, what is different from those movements/s/s/s/s/... is that all of this happens within the liturgical and theological framework of the Orthodox tradition.  In Orthodoxy there is no anti-authoritative \\"spirituality\\" devoid of meaningful content so as to be incommunicable (other than through supposed \\"feeling\\"): the linguistic (tradition) and the spiritual (God) dance, quite literally, an *incarnate* dance. <br /> <br />So, in order to understand the Orthodox spiritual/ascetic/mystical-theological tradition, one must be a part of the tradition - or at least willing to accept its legitimacy and the *reality* of its expression.  There is here a sense of authority: spiritual masters (elders) have expertise in spiritual things and these have also been passed down.  Hence, the elder-disciple relationship is fundamental to the Orthodox monastic vocation.  This is no individualistic spirituality and those who think that spirituality is for the individual - and therefore purely subjective and therefore without any real content - are likely to be turned off by this book.  Fr. Maximos claims that there are real spiritual truths that one must orient one's self to and that there are real stages in spiritual development and real ways in dealing with demonic attack, etc. - hardly the run-of-the-mill liberal discourse that one is too used to hearing.  Yet, for those that are humble enough to recieve from the tradition of the Elders, there will be much benefit here. <br /> <br />So, for those on the way, this is a book that I highlyrecommend.  Although I fault Markides' caricatures of the West and Western spirituality towards the end of the book, he is right to point out that the West and the East really need each other: the rational without the mystical (and vice versa) is dead.  Markides' doubts open up questions and these questions open up Fr. Maximos to share what he has both learned and experienced.  Get ready, though, for a ride through the spiritual traditions of Eastern Orthodoxy that might be as foreign as they are fascinating.  Yet, this exotica might be more than some mere eros: it might be the very life of God.	2004-10-27
US	50993506	R2NIZHWVZ14BQC	0631229396	333779940	The Intellectual Origins of the European Reformation	Books	5	26	27	N	N	Hyper-Augustinianism: Sub-Augustinianism	Being something of an armchair church historian, it was with a good bit of interest that I picked this book up.  The Reformation was a very complex set of events on religious, political, technological and economic fronts; to understand the theological developments that gave rise to someone such as Luther is often made difficult amidst the seemingly unending narratives of socio-political upheaval and the rise of merchant classes.  Hence, a volume such as this, devoted to the intellectual origins of the Reformation, comes for this reader as a welcome addition to my library. <br /> <br />Towards the end of the book McGrath, citing B. B. Warfield, sums up what the Reformation was: the triumph of Augustine's theology of grace *over* Augustine's theology of the Church.  The Reformation, often mis-characterized as a return to the Scriptures was, in fact, the cementing of a particular reading of Augustine which was, at the same time, a hermeneutic for reading the Bible.  In fact, the Reformation owes very little to any real theological break; certain trends in late Medieval thought are what gave Luther (more so than Zwingli) the tools for cementing a theology that eventually broke the mold that gave birth to it. <br /> <br />McGrath is a thorough historian, noting that the Reformation was really a collection of local reformations, the earliest of which were the Lutheran and Swiss.  The difference between the Lutheran and Swiss reformations could not have been more different, it would seem; the former was concentrated in certain readings of Augustine and confined to the university, while the latter was concerned far more with moral exactitude among the clergy.  The Lutheran Reformation appears to be far more in keeping with late medieval Scholasticism, whereas the Swiss Reformation appears to be more of a break done along moralistic-political lines. <br /> <br />This book focuses more upon the origins of the Reformation, and therefore the Reformation in its earlier stages; references to reformers such as John Calvin are largely to the side.  However, what McGrath offers are tantalizing bits - particularly a short statement that Calvin did much to bring the Swiss and Lutheran reformations together.  Yet, because Calvin is among second generation of Swiss reformers, McGrath does not follow up on this noodle. <br /> <br />This is an excellent, excellent volume.  I highly recommend it to everyone interested in the Reformation, particularly those who view the Reformation as being either extremely disastrous or as being extremely triumphant.  It was neither.  Rather, it was the triumph of a particular reading - and questions of hermeneutics present themselves constantly throughout the book - of Augustine and through Augustine, the Bible.  It was the triumph of particular themes at the expense of others - most problematically, the sacrifice of any notion of the Church as a catholic (= universal) and unified body. <br /> <br />Regardless of how one feels about how the Reformation ended (has it ended???), it is well worth noting how it began: and this book illuminates just that.	2004-10-12
US	50993506	RV212A5E1M5WS	0802821197	131099875	Writing in the Dust: After September 11	Books	5	7	8	N	Y	Breathing Space	It is rare that one reads a book and finds one's self without words at the end; it is rare - for this reader, at least - to feel a need to re-read the conclusion of a book because something has been stated at the end that must be grasped but isn't on the first reading.  It is rare that the conclusion of a book would be - again, for this reader - so utterly profound and unexpected that I simply sat in my local coffee shop, staring at the book that I was holding in my hands before I realized in my fog that I had to re-read Williams' conclusion.  The breathing space that he pleads for in his conclusion comes unexpectedly; his reading of the story the Gospel of St. John was more than eye-opening: it was like an unexpected flash of light that left me momentarily dazed. <br /> <br />You can read this book in a single sitting as it is a short read.  Williams begins with discussing his own time in New York when the towers were hit and subsequently fell; he then digresses a bit and discusses various ways of engaging - and not engaging - the problems raised by 9/11.  It is interesting to read the perspective of someone who lives in the UK; this book was written before the USA invaded Iraq, but since the UK was the USA'a main ally in the \\"war on terrorism\\", one gets an insight into some of the discussions that were going on in the UK before the invasion. <br /> <br />Williams - thank God - is not a thinker who is easy to classify.  He think outside of and beyond both \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" boxes (which Christianity, at its best, always does); if one may borrow a statement from Pope John Paul II, the Christian is to be a \\"sign of contradiction\\" to the secular world - and Williams gracefully is.  His main concern in this book is to not merely request but to plead for some breathing space in the aftermath of the attacks.  This breathing space is not necessarily pacifism and nowhere does Williams call for pacifism; he notes that there is a time for war.  Yet, we must be equally on guard against any desire to find a scapegoat - be it a nation, a people, an ideology, whatever - so that we can again feel in control (especially when we aren't - and let's be honest: we never really are in control). <br /> <br />Yet, it is the way the book ends that implants it so deeply in my mind, heart and imagination.  Williams offers a short reflection on a passage in the Gospel of John, when the adulterous woman is brought before Christ and before a crowd that is ready to stone her for her sin.  What does Christ do?  He writes in the dust.  As Williams put it, this happens before both judgement and forgiveness; it is this writing in the dust that gives the chance for some of our demons \\"to walk away.\\" <br /> <br />Like many of the Archbishop's other books, I highly recommend reading this one as well.  Given the increased tension in the current political climate - which will only increase as the Presidential election nears - Williams' book is a good place to find that breathing space that exists on the doorstep of both judgement and forgiveness.	2004-09-24

It is from here, then, that I wish to set out and discuss Gary Anderson's fascinating book on the many different readings - the many different variations - of the myth of Adam and Eve.  My usage of the word \\"myth\\" should not be seen as derogatory or as intended to undermine the readings of Adam and Eve that have been informative to both Judaism/s and Christianity/s.  Rather, I use the term as a way of referencing via a singular noun what is, in fact, a cluster of stories that all center on a particular narrative: the narrative of Adam and Eve. <br /> <br />The subtitle of the book is \\"Adam and Eve in Jewish and Christian Imagination.\\"  For this reader, placing religion within the realm of imagination is a welcome step, as it removes religion from epistemological disputes that ground themselves in certain notions of knowledge as \\"certainty\\"; furthermore, it gives room for hermeneutics - the interpretation of texts - and recognizes that different interpretations need not necessarily be seen as antithetical to or divergent from a larger tradition. <br /> <br />It is interesting, for example, to compare St. Augustine's readings of Genesis with St. Ephrem's readings.  Although both early Christian thinkers are Doctors of the Church in Roman Catholicism and considered by the Orthodox and Anglican churches to be among the greatest of all Christian theologians, their understandings of the Adam and Eve narrative - particularly the fall and sexuality - are quite divergent.  What becomes apparent is that context and cultural tendencies play a role in their interpretations; in particular, St. Ephrem's interpretations very closely parallel those of Jewish beliefs that were widely held in Syria, where Ephrem lived, at the time of his writing. <br /> <br />The book is neither limited to Christian readings of the story nor do Jewish readings simply serve as a stage on which to presentChristian interpretations.  Anderson spends a good time detailing both Rabbinic and non-Rabbinic writings; while he spends less time detailing Rabbinic (= normative Jewish) sources than detailing normative Christian sources (such as the aforementioned interpretations of Augustine and Ephrem), this does not mean that he spends less time on Jewish thought as such: he spends quite a good time discussing so-called \\"apocryphal\\" Jewish and Jewish-Christian literature, neither of which ever became normative in either tradition, but both of which are important for understanding the context/s and the spectrum of belief/s that were a part of the Jewish and Christian worlds during their formative periods.  And, as can be seen from the example of Ephrem, such seemingly distant \\"apocrypha\\" may, in fact, be far more a part of the larger understanding of such a seemingly simple text as Genesis 1 - 3 than would otherwise be assumed. <br /> <br />This is a great book that works on multiple levels: historical, theological and socio-cultural.  By bringing in so many voices - Jewish and Christian, normative and distantly normative - Anderson shows the incredible ability of \\"the\\" standard text to be read in ways that are both insightful and imaginative.  It is in the imagination that the space for reading exists, and Anderson illuminates this almost perfectly.	2004-09-14

Runciman's telling of this bitter tale - and it is a tale that spans not only the 11th and 12th centuries, but has roots going back far deeper - is both concise and lucid.  Runciman clearly details this narrative that has proved debilitating to Christianity ever since - not only between the East and the West, but also between the umpteen gazillion Protestant churches and the Roman Catholic church. <br /> <br />Runciman does a wondeful job summarizing the various events of previous years (especially the Photian Schism, which occured in the 9th century) that helped to lay the \\"groundwork\\", so to speak, for the ultimate rending of Christendom.  Yet, despite the great attention that is sometimes given to various events (especially to Cardinal Humbert's excommunicating Patriarch Michael Cerularius, who in turn excommunicated Humbert), Runciman's thesis is that the \\"schism\\" did not occur at a particular instant, but gradually over time.  It was not until the middle of the 13th century that the received opinion of both clergy and layman was that the churches were no longer in communion with one another. <br /> <br />In fact, the mutual excommunications noted above, which occured in 1054, are really little more than a blip on the screen of East-West relations: Humbert did not have the power to excommunicate Cerularius, and Cerularius' excommunicating Humbert should not be understood as Cerularius excommunicating the whole Western church - something that the popular imagination of both Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy would do well to remember.  So, the received thesis that the split occured in 1054 needs to be abandoned. <br /> <br />Runciman also does a wonderful job of appreciating and detailing the socio-theological and theological-political nature of the Church during the so-called \\"Middle\\" Ages.  That the Church should have such a public presence, and that this public presence should be so important to both the popular mind and international relations may seem strange.  It was, indeed, a different world, complete with its own pitfalls and glories.  Yet, it is interesting to note that the most divisive theological issue - papal supremacy - also fueled the Crusades, which were more influential than anything else in breaking Christendom apart. <br /> <br />It is a shame that this book has gone out of print again.  Perhaps on its 50th anniversary it will be printed yet again, and people will begin to appreciate the subtle differences that, given the fourth Crusade, were exacerbated into the greatest and most tragic split that the Church has ever known - and most likely will ever know.  If you can find a copy of this book, I highly recommend picking it up.  Although you will catch bits and pieces of this story in many other books, this volume will illuminate its complexities and clear away the myths surrounding it like other books - especially theological works - won't.  It is, sadly, a crucial and divisive narrative.	2004-09-11

Although one may read a secondary reader, there is nothing like reading a well-chosen sampling of primary texts - and the selections here are just that: well-chosen. <br /> <br />Although the Church traces its lineage and heritage through a particular history - the New Testament, followed by the Apostolic Fathers and they themselves followed by the Church Fathers - in reading this volume one immediately notices a spectrum of thought, filled with every subtle shade of variation that one could imagine.  It is in reading the differences and polemical writings contained here that makes the battles between traditions so fascinating: after the New Testament, one can rightly speak of earliest Christianities.  Somehow or another, though, they all find their raison d'etre in Jesus, the itinerant Jewis Hasid from Nazareth. <br /> <br />Perhaps one may be generous enough to say that every writing in this book seeks to answer Christ's question to the Apostles: \\"Who do you say that I am?\\"  From Gnostic writings and proto-orthodox Church Fathers to apocryphal Gospels and \\"lost\\" Epistles, one is thrust into a mass of movements, each of which claims to have the answer to this question.  (And, as a side note, it turns out that the views of the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches are, in fact, among the most ancient of these various other traditions.) <br /> <br />Ehrman's introductions are short and to the point; they are helpful and note where writings develop earlier, more historical traditions, if writings were later declared orthodox or heretical and what the polemical context was of a particular piece.  He also notes where texts were once used and where they were popular, and if and when they fell out of favor.  Lastly, and most interestingly to this reader, is the short section that notes the development of the canon of the New Testament and how many books that are now taken for granted were hotly debated in those early centuries. <br /> <br />One could easily spend hundreds of dollars collecting the various works that were important to and written by early Christians/s/s/s/s/...; this book is a wonderful, well-written selection of those works.  As a supplement to studies in early Christianity, Judaism and/or later Antiquity, it will prove to be quite helpful and informative.  For the interested lay person, this book will also prove to be both informative and an excellent introduction to the subject.  In short, it is a profitable read.	2004-09-02

So, although the content provides an excellent introduction to sacramental theology and provides a fascinating insight into the early liturgical praxis of the mid-4th century Jerusalem church, the translation does absolutely no justice to the importance of these texts.<br /><br />Hence the rating of 3 stars.  Frankly, I'm surprised that SVS Press would provide not only such an outdated translation (perhaps because it is now in the public domain?), but a translation that is based on an (inferior?) Benedictine translation.  Why not a translation based upon a critical edition of the Greek text?  The introduction is helpful, as it helps to illuminate the original context of the work.  Liturgical developments, Cyril's own tendencies in thought (pastoral/practical rather than theoretical) and theological controversies are given a helpful, if cursory, treatment.<br /><br />The actual work is short.  The book contains, interestingly enough, a translation entirely in Greek (although why and what its relation is to the version of the text that is translated is never mentioned) and is followed by the English translation.  The content is basically that of what the catechumen are to expect in being fully received into communion in the Church: the liturgical practices and their meaning, as well as the meaning of the various steps in converting, especially baptism and exorcism/s.<br /><br />The most interesting thing in reading this was learning about baptisms and that they were done in the nude.  The meaning seems to be to a sense of innocence - the innocence of humanity before the fall - yet, at the same time, as women and men were baptized separately so as to avoid inciting lust, one might also wonder how thick the meaning behind this nude baptism really was.  It is an interesting idea, though!<br /><br />In the end, this book is a quick read and provides an interesting insight into some of the beliefs and practices of the earlier Church.  The translation obscures, sadly, the importance of these texts - and various liturgical practices that seem to having begun in Jerusalem have since become almost universally practiced in the Church - but reading this particular translation can still be helpful (although better ones exist).arlier Church.

For me, this point wasn't until about halfway through the book, in chapter 5, when I realized that a reading of a church building is not like a reading of a book: the imagination presences itself front-and-center, rather than lurking in the background, masked by a self-proclaimed \\"objectivity\\".  The religious imagination embodies itself in the artwork, architecture and ceremony that *is* the church. <br /> <br />This book is a thick narrative that works on multiple levels: architectural and artistic, theological and socio-historical.  The church building itself is far from static; in letting the church speak of what is timeless, it itself enters into time: ancient altars and recent restorations, classical Byzantine mosaics and Baroque-inspired paintings all inhabit the same space of the church.  Each generation, each culture has done something to become a part of the history of the church, and therefore a part of the next generation.  The church becomes a shared narrative, so to speak: a structural representating of communion. <br /> <br />The book functions as both an introduction to Christianity, and more specifically Roman Catholicism.  Visser situates her text within the larger history of the Roman church, a world filled with saints and mystics, ascetics, martyrs and power struggles, sacraments and quasi-magical popular beliefs.  It is a world in which the dead still have a presence in the present, and in which heaven and earth meet at particular times and in particular places - and more in the church than anywhere else. <br /> <br />What appears more than anything else in Visser's work is that of the Roman Catholic imagination.  Although certain theologians were largely systematic, the wider history of the Roman Catholic church speaks a different story: sacred time and sacred space, and an experience of the mysterium tremendum.  It is within this sense of the sacred, embodied temporally and spatially in the liturgy and the sacraments, and continually witnessed to by the church building, which holds the people whose histories give rise to it, its development and change, restoration and remembering over time. <br /> <br />Visser's work is a brialliant book that will be enriched by those who come with prior knowledge, and will enrich those who pursue more knowledge afterwards.  One will learn about Christian theology and history, and its socio-historical imaginings throughout time.  Visser's text works outside of simplistic - even if rigorous - textual analyses, and looks to history and its representations in space and time.  A brialliant work for those with heart, mind and spirit: imagination.	2004-08-25

For Zizioulas, this communion of the Trinity is the model to be embodied not only by the Church as the communion of all churches, but by the very person as well: we only are who we are when we are in communion with God and one another.<br /><br />The title of the book is no mistake; Zizioulas puts himself in dialogue with some of the great philosophers of the 20th century (such as Heidegger and Levinas, the latter of whom he praises, particularly his work Totality and Inifinity).  The fundamental point that Zizioulas raises about Being is that in the eucharist - in the act of communion itself! - the essential and the temporal become fused into a living harmony.  Such was - and is - Christ, and such also is to be the Church and the Christian, participating in the eternal life of God while in the here and now.  Being is not static, but in time and in relation.<br /><br />For those that have found themselves turned off to Orthodox theology in the past due its oftentimes proclaimed self-sufficiency, Zizioulas may very well seem like a theologian that comes out of left field: his *criticisms* of Orthodox theology (and I have never read an Orthodox theologian that was critical of Orthodox theology before) are what many Western inquirers have long wanted to know: can Orthodoxy be constructively self-critical?  Can Orthodoxy be open to the recognition of Western churches as viable, even if critiquing them at the same time?  Zizioulas presents an unapologetic \\"yes\\" to both of these questions.<br /><br />The most heartening thing about this book, however, is the fundamentally pastoral angle the Zizioulas takes.  While he can discuss the Cappadocians, for example, at great length, he also sees the essentially pastoral implications of the relational, Trinitarian God: the imitation of this *as* the relational pastor.  He is especially concerned with the rise of anti-clericalism in both Greece and abroad; he sees this anti-clericalism as committing the same fallacy that it seeks to fight against: the reduction of the Church to being first and foremost an institution.  Yet, he also sees how the pastoral failures of the past have contributed to this by not seeking to incarnate the fundamentally relational nature of God.<br /><br />The book ends with a substantive - and crucial - question.  If the Church is fundamentally the communion of churches, what do we make of churches that are in ecclesiastical and/or confessional division?  It is with this question that Zizioulas quite literally ends; it is an abrupt ending, too, that leaves reader in a state of suspension.  Yet, I can't think of a better way to end it.  From theology as the contemplation of God to the reality of a fragmented Church (especially with regard to Protestantism/s/s/s/s/s...), there is quite a tragic distance.  It is in the recognition of this distance, though, that the real conversation and communication - the very word \\"communication\\" being etymologically related to both \\"community\\" and \\"communion\\" - begins.<br /><br />This is a book that cuts through dogmatic and ecclesiastical divisions and asks substantive questions that are birthed from the very life of the God who is in communion with himself and, in being so, opens himself to communing with all others.  At this time, I know of no other book that more urgently needs to be read; and, I knowof no other book that I would more highly recommend.and, I know of no other book that I would more highly recommend.	2004-08-23
US	50993506	R34KXQ3SRKNYWV	0415095263	496199573	The Continental Philosophy Reader	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	A Helpful, Clear Survey	If one is interested in getting to know some of the trends in 20th century continental philosophy, I know of no better place to start than with this reader.  Richard Kearney and Mara Rainwater break the book down into three sections: From Phenomenology to Hermeneutics, From Marxism to Critical Theory and From Structuralism to Deconstruction.  Within each section, works are presented in chronological order from major thinkers within these broadly defined movements; this enables the reader to see both continuities and differences between the authors in each section. <br /> <br />It is also helpful that Kearney and Rainwater note that many of the authors could have easily fit into multiple sections; 20th century continental philosophy then becomes something of a large dialogue between people from different decades and in different places.  Anyone even remotely familiar with the topic will agree that continental philosophy is thick; it is to Kearney and Rainwater's credit that, in editing this reader, it loses none of its thickness but serves, instead, to draw the reader into the discussion/s that it contains. <br /> <br />The introductions to each thinker are wonderful, detailing historical context and mentors, major trends and changes in the whole of their work.  It would have been nice, however, if these introductions to said a bit about why a particular piece was chosen and how it fits into the history of one of the three sections.  All of the pieces included are obviously not ground breaking in and of themselves, but some of them are and bristle with a level of intellectual rigour and moral clarity that the vast majority of philosophers would do well to remember - the selection from Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment is one such piece, and Walter Benjamin's Theses on the Philosophy of History is another. <br /> <br />Any knowledge of the history of 20th century Europe will help to put some of these pieces in a greater context; one can oftentimes feel the horrific weight of WWII and Nazism, for example, in the background of some of the pieces.  If this volume is any indication, the companion volume, which is a history of 20th century continental thought, will also be well worth checking out.  All in all, this is an excellent reader that I highly recommend to any and all interested in the area of 20th century continental philosophy.	2004-08-02

Some of that no doubt has to do with learning a bit about my own Cuban heritage (mi abuela es de Cuba), but it also has to do with reading an author of uncommon grace and depth, who lacks neither humor nor bitterness in remembering and longing for his abruptly ended childhood.  You can't help but to get misty eyed in the midst of your laughter; Eire lets the reader feel in ways that most authors can, at their best, only dream of.    It is rare that an author can combine multiple streams of thought into a [raging] river that contains both depth and complexity, but Eire appears to be one such author, combining history, memoir, theology and philosophy into a thick narrative about his childhood exile from Cuba.  He is endowed with a tremendous sense of the poetic; he writes sensuously of Cuban nights before the Revolution, the perplexities of childhood (some experience really are universal) and the uneasiness of Cuba after Castro seized power.    Eire is not without bitterness, either, as he reflects upon his exile and the difficulties it caused his family.  He never saw his father again after he left Cuba, but his father also chose to not come over to the US with his mother; the mockery and sarcasm that Eire directs towards his father is understandable given the relational distance that his father placed within the relationship.    The real highlight of the book, however, is Eire's ability to evoke emotion from the reader as he recalls his childhood.  Reading his memories of Roman Catholic masses and schools is absolutely side splitting; the mixture of memory and imagination is written in a stream-of-consciousness style that brings to light the subjective reality of various events.  In reading of the (privileged) state of Eire's life before Castro, the anger that he feels due to Castro makes that much more sense.    This is a book well worth reading.  The voice of exile that is Eire's is a beautiful one that runs deeper than the surface: it has its scars and memories, its hopes and prayers.  I highly recommend it.	2004-07-26
US	50993506	R3QDAWJ3K1YYII	0300091656	958142798	Saints and Sinners: A History of the Popes, Second Edition	Books	4	79	83	N	Y	Saints and Sinners Indeed	Eamon Duffy's small tome - a contradiction in terms, admittedly, but such a contradiction aptly fits its subject matter - is probably about as detailed a history as one could have in slightly less than 400 pages.  Duffy aims towards a fair, balanced view not only of the papacy's history, but of individual popes.  The title of the book itself describes not only those that make up the history of the papacy, but the conflicting tendencies that existed within individual popes as well.<br />Part of the benefit of reading this book is that one not only learns the socio-historical elements of the papacy - and it should be remembered that the papacy is the most administrative and political element of the Roman Catholic church - but the development of the theology behind the papacy.  The primacy of the bishop of Rome emerges as the most historically contentious issue.  Duffy notes that the 2nd century Church Father Irenaeus gives the Church of Rome a place of primacy in his writings, but that the idea of the pope being successor of St. Peter the apostle is not documented until the 3rd century.  The tensions between the bishop of Rome and the bishop of Constantinople begin to develop more after Constantine moves the center of the Roman Empire from Rome to Constantinople, wedding politics to religion in Constantinople in a new way.<br />Duffy writes that until Charlemagne, the Church of the East was not only the hotbed of the heresy, but also the hotbed of political dissidents; that such political-religious friction should exist in the capital of the Roman Empire, given the new union of religion to politics, is not surprising.  Duffy tries to sort through the various political-religious controversies of this time period, but it becomes obvious that splitting religion from politics in the ancient Roman empire is difficult, if not impossible to do.  The history of the papacy between 1054 (the Great Schism between the East and the West) through Napoleon is largely corrupt, however.  Once the empire split in two, Rome becomes the political-religious center of the West and the papacy's spirituality degenerates as it is continually thrown to the highest bidder.  The Reformation and the religious wars of the 17th century appear to be inevitable.  The fragmentation of Europe into nation-states, although largely political, was not without theological ramifications.<br />Interestingly enough, the distance between the spiritual and secular-political elements of the papacy happens with the theological development of papal infallibility during Vatican I.  The official teaching steered clear of the radical views of the Ultramontanists, who held that everything the pope taught was infallible - that revelation was \\"on tap\\", as Duffy puts it.  Vatican I still gave to the papacy (the office, not the pope as an individual) a level of primacy and honor that has long been claimed by the bishop of Rome, but it rendered the pope's \\"infallibility\\" only in matters pertaining to faith and morals (therefore, not politics, science, art, etc.), of concern to the whole church and in consultation with other bishops; the pope will be guided by God should he speak \\"ex cathedra\\" - from the chair of Peter.  Duffy immediately notes that this has only happened one time, on the issue of the assumption of Mary into heaven (which the vast majority of Christians have believed since at least the second century).  Despite the controversy that this doctrine has brought about, Duffy's coverage of it causes it to seem rather anti-climactic.<br />The book may end seeming a bit dated to some, as the last chapter only goes through 1997 (with a passing reference, oddly enough, to 2002).  Duffy covers the highly controversial papacy of Pius XII with a good bit of critical sympathy and then proceeds to discuss the period of Vatican II and what a watershed event it was.  He notes the theological changes, the political tensions and the changes that occurred between popes John XXIII and PaulVI as the latter continued to convene the council.  He concludes with the current pope, John Paul II, noting his philosophical brilliance, his desire for reunion with the Eastern Orthodox Church and his conservativism regarding the theology of the papacy.  He notes that John Paul II is a complex figure, at once a humanist and theologically conservative, defying the simple labels of \\"liberal\\" or \\"conservative\\".  Although John Paul II's full history has yet to be written, Duffy provides an excellent trajectory from where he has gone to where he is likely to go by the end of his life.<br />My only complaint with the book is that Duffy shows something of an ambivalent attachment style to most of the popes after 1054.  While a \\"liberal\\" such as John XXIII garners heavy praise from him, other popes less conducive to the modern era are denigrated.  The question is, \\"what makes the modern era so great and why should modernizing trends be seen as necessary and/or good?\\"  In many ways, I agree with Duffy, but would also prefer to not have a pope praised at one point and then berated only a few pages later; at points Duffy sounds like a broken record as he oscillates between the two for one pope after another.<br />In the end, though, this is a very well written book.  The appendices - a list of the popes, a glossary and how a pope is made today - are helpful.  The history of the papacy is a thick one and Duffy does not make light of this, including at the end of his book a bibliographical essay that details secondary and primary sources that further illuminate each time period he covers.  For a fuller understanding of Western political and/or religious history, historical theology and/or Roman Catholicism, this is a find edition to include in one's library.	2004-07-09

The point of the Church is to be a witness to the common, shared humanity of man by bringing us all together into the body of Christ.  The [Roman] Catholic church embodies this intention of God - that all would be one - more so than any other ideology, religion or church.<br />Interestingly enough, for de Lubac unity does not mean uniformity but, instead, presupposes difference.  De Lubac does believe that the Holy Spirit continues to speak through the Pope today just as the Holy Spirit spoke through the Apostles; given this, any notion of catholicity that denies the primacy of the the Papacy would not fit into de Lubac's vision.  Although it is too easy and too common to place the community over and above the individual, de Lubac places the individual within the community by recognizing that the difference between individuals is what allows unity-within-difference to exist.  The individual communes with God and with others; the point of the Church is to bring the people together, before God, and therefore also face to face with one another.<br />This, however, is also the first limitation of de Lubac's vision: it does not get into the *reality* of the divisions between the Churches that are Catholic - Anglican, Orthodox and Roman Catholic - and does not really engage the reality of Protestantism/s/s/s/s/s/...  De Lubac gives a beautiful vision of the Church as pure, undefiled and united.  The reality of brining together the broken church is never explored, however.<br />The second problem with this book is the utter *lack* of translated footnotes!  The book is probably half footnotes, many of which are simply left in Latin.  It makes for a fairly maddening read at points, especially since it is obvious that de Lubac really knows his stuff.  He is deeply rooted within the spirituality of [Roman] Catholicism; not being able to read who he thought was worth citing keeps the reader from being able to grasp the full depth and breadth of his thought.<br />De Lubac's writing is a fresh engagement with the Fathers of the Church, primarily, but he also engages Scripture and the Scholastics.  He has a nearly 70-page appendix of citations from various works of the Fathers (and yes, they are all translated into English), which helps the reader understand better his view of the Church.  Catholicism: Christ and the Common Destiny of Man is a brilliant synthesis of ancient and new theology and ecclesiology that will help the reader gain a far greater insight into what it means to be an individual that is a part of the community called the Catholic (universal) church.	2004-06-21

Although I did not appreciate it when I first read it - much like Holden would have not appreciated it if he had read it at 15 (or 17), I suspect - several years later, when I read it again, I not only saw myself in Holden Caulfield, but found myself laughing all the way through the book.  This is a wonderful read that speaks as clearly now of the experience of youth as it did when it was written 50+ years ago.<br />This book was J. D. Salinger's only novel; his other &quot;books&quot; are actually collections of short stories.  Yet, The Catcher in the Rye, by its very brilliance, has put Salinger on the list of great (even if eccentric - he went into seclusion) authors of the 20th century.<br />In short, Caulfield is what one would now call a &quot;troubled teen&quot;.  He refuses to focus on his schoolwork, is constantly in trouble for acting out, has the mouth of a sailor (on a bad day, for that matter) and, at the start of the story, decides that he is going to simply quit going to school and take an early - and extended - winter vacation.  Here the book begins.<br />The importance of the story, however, is not the actual development of the plot - his failed attempt with a prostitute, his looking up an old girl friend, his visiting his sister - but is, instead, the thought life of Holden; Salinger portrays him sympathetically.  Amidst all his cynicism, Holden shows himself to be a naive optimist, and the holding of these two things in tension is what gives Holden his dynamic.  &quot;If a body catch a body, comin' through the rye&quot;, he sings to himself: he wants to save the world.<br />The question by the end of the book, however, is whether or not Holden can do so or if, instead, he will &quot;die nobly for some highly unworthy cause.&quot;  One of Holden's old teachers, in a scene with a strange bit of homoeroticism, tells Holden that he fears he will end up as a quasi-martyr; Holden himself, in his very desire to save the young from the cliff that he himself stands so close to, confirms this fear as being a realistic one.<br />Yet, by the end of the book, Holden is almost &quot;saved&quot; by the simple love of his sister who worries about him and wants to help him out but at the same time cannot grasp the complexity of his situation.  The real gift she gives Holden is her own simple and loving trust.<br />We learn by the end of the book that Holden is going back to school with what seems to be a clearer sense of direction than he had previously.  For me, it's a fairly unfulfilling conclusion, but it serves its purpose in that it diverts attention away from what *might* be Holden's future and returns it to the focus of the book: Holden's time playing hooky, running from his problems, not finding himself so much as being found in being touched by the love of his sister.<br />It's a beautiful work that I highly, highly recommend.	2004-06-12

All later Christian thought on the sacraments and artwork (particularly icons) would eventually be an extension of the Christian teaching on the Incarnation; this work, then, not only shapes the basis of later Christian thought, but also determines its trajectory.<br />This is a simple work.  Some of this is due to the work of the translator, breaking up the work into short sections and translating it into contemporary English without sacrificing its content; the majority of it has to do, however, with Athansius' own desire: to communicate simply the profound message of God-become-man.  C. S. Lewis contributes a wonderful introduction, noting correctly that we would all do better to &quot;read the old books&quot;, such as this one.<br />In short, Athanasius writes that &quot;God became man so that man might become god&quot;.  If taken out of its context, such a quote could easily be misinterpreted; it should be understood, however, in this way: by God's taking on a human body, the human body has been brought up into the very life of God.  Rather than denigrating physical, created matter, the Incarnation vindicates its being created.  The body then, is now understood as the site of the most profound of meanings: its being given life now and, at a future time, being given life again.<br />Understandings of the Incarnation as being purely juridical, with effects relegated to an ethereal world of purely legal justification, find no place here.  Athanasius also does not focus upon the death of Christ or his sufferings as ends in and of themselves.  Rather, the Incarnation is victory over death - death *not* being a curse but, instead, the natural result of man'sturning away from God (the hermeneutic that Athanasius provides for understanding the Apostle Paul's writings is both fascinating and beautiful).  The Incarnation opens us up to union with God, which is most perfectly demonstrated in the union of Christ to God the Father: their wills in perfect communion with each other, in and through love.<br />In this work, Athanasius strikes a perfect balance between the profound and the simple that is not often found in theological writings.  We do well, as Lewis notes, to read the old books.	2004-06-09

Hence, one reads the early Christian apologists of the 2nd century and then immediately after that one reads of the theologies of martyrdom; one reads of the disputes over the incarnation of Christ before one reads about debates over tansubstantiation; one reads Vatican II documents before one reads liberation theologies.  The writings of saints and heretics, Doctors and others, popes, councils and relevant non-Christian writers all appear between the covers of this book.<br />Of course, it ought to be noted that the excerpts are sometimes tremendously short - only a few lines or so.  However, each reference is cited so that the curious reader who wants to go and read volumes of primary texts can do so; for those less inclined to do so, this book is an excellent first-hand introduction to the development/s of Christian thought.<br />However, the documents are largely confined to the Western church.  The documentary history of the Eastern churches is largely absent for almost 1000 years: between 1054 (the Great Schism between the Eastern and the Western church) and the beginning of the ecumenical movement in the 20th century.  So, if the reader wants to learn about the Palamite controversy or the Hesychast revival or the monastic influence of the Russian Orthodox monks, one will have to look elsewhere (although, I confess, I do not know where).<br />Nonetheless, this is an excellent compilation.  The reader will learn plenty aboutrecent theological developments, including various perspectives on sexuality, sex and gender, social work, feminist theology and liberation theology.  How many of these more recent theological movements and trends will prove to be of long-lasting import remains to be seen, but since they are relevant now, it is important for the reader to be somewhat familiar with them.<br />All things considered, this is a wonderful collection.	2004-06-09

Some may react to the the term \\"post-liberal\\" as being yet another banal way of exploiting the end of the modern period and its narrative/s, but responding in this way would likely fail to engage and appreciate the eloquent and gracious subverting of narrow categories such as \\"conservative\\" and \\"liberal\\" that takes place in Williams' work.  He is a deep breath of fresh air; even when you don't agree with him, he still shines a new light on topics, especially those that are worn out by tiresome conservative and/or liberal *over*simplifications.<br />This book is a collection of sermons; it makes for good contemplative reading as one may read only one or two sermons at a time or, instead, read through an entire section of the book in a single sitting.  Being a collection of sermons, it contains neither a bibliography nor detailed footnotes.  Although both would be welcome, both would probably also take away from the point of the book, which is not to be an academic work so much as it is to be a pastoral work which encompasses but is not limited to the academic.<br />And, it is Williams' pastoral heart that shines through in each sermon.  He shows himself to be a man of not only academic learning and intellectual insight, but also full of compassion and having a deep spirituality.  The universality and the particularity of Christ's saving work and message dance an intricate dance with each other throughout the book.  The universal and the particular both move in grace; Williams gives his words over to embodying these movements in their depth, complexity and mystery.<br />My favorite sermon is titled, \\"Is There a Christian Sexual Ethic?\\"  Characteristically, Williams avoids a simple \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" but instead outlines contours, some of which show their depth and fullness in the light of \\"conservative\\" thought, and others of which show these in the light of \\"liberal\\" thought.  Williams resists the license of liberalism and the legalism of conservativism, choosing instead to understand the giving of the body in terms of gift, grace and love - in short, Christian *thinking*.  Although he remains more liberal on the topic than I am, I remain indebted to his insights, which have pushed me to think more deeply about what is not just a complex issue, but a beautiful one as well.<br />For those that have not yet read the good Archbishop, this is a wonderful place to start.  For those that have read him, this is an excellent place to continue.  Regardless of where you are, Williams' Ray of Darkness will put things in a wonderfully new light: humbly, gracefully and with all their depth, complexity and beauty intact.in the light of \\"liberal\\" thought.

US	50993506	RFPL384QYR8Q7	0226505413	293347457	God Without Being: Hors-Texte (Religion and Postmodernism)	Books	5	39	40	N	Y	God: Given (and) Outside, After and Beyond the Text	This review starts out with a bit of perplexity: there are two works in this book, 1) God Without Being, and 2) Hors-Texte.  &quot;Hors-Texte&quot; translates, literally, as &quot; 'outside the text,' the unpaginated plates added to the end of a book.&quot;  My question here is, what is the relationship between these two works?  My guess is that they are to be read together: Hors-Texte gives a place for the embodiment of (the) God Without Being.  This embodiment takes place (&quot;place&quot; being here an intentionally spatial reference) in liturgy and the eucharist: God gives God's self outside of, after and beyond the text.  This book functions as a work of theology (Marion is Roman Catholic) but can also function as a work in the philosophy of religion: religion is not something textual, so much as it is embodied in real time and real space.<br />Marion, however, is not a theologian or philosopher of religion who seeks to arrive at a conception of God (or, for that matter, religion) that justifies a particular philosophy.  Hence, he breaks fully with Enlightenment rationalists who seek a God that does little more than justify their own ideas of autonomy: for Marion, God is not the unmoved mover who must be before he loves.  Rather, God loves before being: it is God's love which gives place to the Being of beings.<br />This understanding of God as agape is a break, however, not only with so-called rationalists, but with scholasticism and late modern/post-modern thinkers such as Nietzsche and Heidegger.  Marion works off of both Nietzsche and Heidegger but also criticizes them for not giving a place to a God who loves before being.  Nietzsche's twilight of the idols is nothing more than the twilight of particular idols: atheism is simply the refusal to believe in a particular *conception* of God, not God as such (although few, if any, atheists would ever admit to this).  Similarly, Heidegger's subsuming God to the predicates of Being is equally misguided and blind; in the end, both Nietzsche and Heidegger commit a type of idolatry.  For Marion, theology ought to be iconic: We only &quot;see&quot; God between the &quot;halftimes of our idolatries&quot;, he writes.<br />This God who exceeds our prior conceptions - that is, the predicates of Being - is not the God of metaphysics (onto-theology as Marion, following Heidegger, asserts).  Rather, he is the God of unknowing: in short, revelation.  Marion turns to the great mystics of the Church, particularly Dionysius the Aeropagite (aka Pseudo-Dionysius) and his mystical theology.  There is something wonderfully raw about this; Marion's call to return to an understanding of God who loves outside of and beyond our ability to comprehend and inscribe in books finds its fullest expression in liturgy, lived and acted with/in/by bodies.  Hence, God Without Being culminates in incarnation: Christ, in the Church, and in communion.<br />There is a deeply ecclesial dimension to Marion's work.  The Eucharist is celebrated within the life of the community collective whose local leader (the bishop!), as the central servant-celebrant, is the theologian extraordinaire.  It is this embodiment that stands on the threshold of Hors-Texte (quite literally, as this discussion takes place immediately before the second part of the book, Hors-Texte).<br />Marion writes with a rare combination of intellectual rigor, philosophical learning and appreciation, and a deep spirituality.  The icon, ever opposed to the idol, directs our gaze beyond its own presence and to the God (Theos) that is beyond the text, but nonetheless gives Himself - loves - in the Word (Logos), which all theology (from the Greek words &quot;Theos&quot; and &quot;Logos&quot;!) writes towards and is, at its height, converted to.<br />This is not an easy book to read (particularly if you have little or no background in late/post modern philosophy), but it is well worth the effort.  Rarely does a book really give itself to the reader as akey to looking more deeply and seeing more clearly, but for those with eyes to read and ears to hear, they may are likely to find themselves moving beyond the text and into an embodied, liturgical practice, celebrating the Word that all words, at their best, look and are converted to: not on their own, but because of the Word's self-giving to words.	2004-05-30
US	50993506	R25LFT6YYVO7QS	0060932139	104524934	The Unbearable Lightness of Being	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Tragic, Insightful	Anyone with a background in philosophy might do a double take upon reading the title of this book; \\"Being\\" is not typically thought of as being unbearably light but as heavy.  The difference in this book is that for Kundera, amidst the Communist invasion of Czechoslovakia, our being becomes utterly without weight, devoid of substantive meaning.<br />The book begins with Kundera explaining Nietzsche's idea of the eternal return (and Kundera is incredibly well read, citing not just philosophy but religion and mythology as well): the only way that anything can have any meaning is if it can be repeated.  Since this life cannot be repeated, the question becomes whether or not this life can have any meaning?  Kundera does not give an answer to that question, choosing to instead flesh out his characters by not only giving philosophical weight - no pun intended - to the narrative, but by giving psychological insights on their motives and actions.<br />It is hard to say what the real narrative of the book is.  Is it the meaninglessness with which Tomas engages in his endless womanizing?  Is it the utter falsehood that Tomas tries to make real in claiming that sex has nothing to do with love?  Despite his telling his wife that his womanizing has no effect on his love for her, it could easily be argued that what makes his promiscuity so depthless is the fact that he has no love for anyone.  In the end, we see that the body and the soul are intimately connected, not divorced from one another.  The interweaving of these multiple narratives is part of what makes the book so insightful.<br />The book would be little more than a trashy (at points) psychological romance novel, however, if it weren't set in the Communist invasion of Czechoslovakia; indeed, it is the psychological and philosophical insights that are born of the experience of Communism that give the book its weight.  Communism's utopian ideology was so fanatical as to be murderous - similarities between this and violent religious fundamentalists today beg for comparison - and was utterly indifferent to the particular people in the particular countries that it imposed itself upon.  Communism is the socio-political embodiment of the indifference of someone such as Tomas and as such is horrifically insightful.<br />The unbearable lightness of being is heavy; this is not a bad pun, but a recognition of the tremendous irony of it all.  The isolation and erasure of meaningful, particular histories in a world devoid of giving and listening renders everything unbearably light: and therefore unavoidably and oppressively heavy.  Substantive notions such as love lose all of their substance; to borrow from Marx, \\"all that is solid melts into air.\\"<br />Kundera's book is both well written and incredibly tragic.  Ideology at the expense of humanity - either your own or another's (or both!) - is at the root of any soul/body dualism: the infidelity between lovers or the totalitarianism of Communism (and isn't Communism simply soul/body dualism politically imposed on a mass scale?).  Such soul/body dualism is nothing more than the imaginings of philosophers; the unbearable lightness of being cannot help but to become indifferent, oppressive and violent.	2004-05-17
US	50993506	R2319XZRYHTLB9	019925995X	977218684	Catholicism: The Story of Catholic Christianity	Books	5	50	55	N	N	An Excellent Introduction	I am very glad to have recently stumbled across this book while in a local bookstore.  My initial peruse through the contents of the book impressed me as it seemed to be a very thorough account; the high remarks on the back of the book by Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury (the lead bishop of the Anglican Communion), and Philip Jenkins (history and religious studies @ Pennsylvania State University) were the stimuli that caused me to cross the threshold of inhibition and purchase it.<br />The book is written &quot;from the inside&quot;, so to speak.  That is, both authors are not only Roman Catholic, but also priests and theologians.  Furthermore, both are Jesuits, that is, monks in the order of the Society of Jesus.  Despite the widely held cultural belief that the Roman Catholic church is highly secretive if not downright dishonest, both O'Collins and Farrugia write openly: they note the various failures of the past.  However, as they also note early on, the history of the Roman Catholic church is far more than one of failure: otherwise, the only thing that could account for its success would be the (manipulatory) work of the Holy Spirit.<br />The book has 11 chapters:<br />1: The First Thousand Years<BR>2: The Second Thousand Years<BR>3: Revelation, Tradition, and Scripture<BR>4: The Tripersonal God and the Incarnate Son<BR>5: The Human Condition<BR>6: The Life of Grace and the Hope of Glory<BR>7: The Sacraments<BR>8: The Catholic Church and its Mission<BR>9: Catholic Moral Life and Teaching<BR>10: Basic Characteristics of Catholicism<BR>11: Current Challenges<br />Hence, the book is far more than a simple history of the world's largest religion: it is an overview - at times, considerably detailed - of Catholic history, thought, and practice.  As the last chapter's title indicates, the book also takes stock of the current state of things and looks toward the future.<br />Each chapter takes the historical development of ideas into account in the presentationof its theme and the authors note that there have been many changes over time, particularly with and since Vatican II, the most recent of the church's ecumenical councils.  The authors show a good deal of sensitivity to both the Reformation (c. 1500 c.e.) and the Great Schism (1054 c.e.), which was when the church Catholic broke into eastern and western churches: the Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, respectively.  Although the authors show themselves to be sympathetic to the Anglican Communion and other Protestant groups - some of which are far more in continuity with the shared Catholic tradition than others - there is a special place given to the Orthodox church.<br />It is appreciated that this book does not take a &quot;top-down&quot; approach: the social life of the church, filled with saints (and sinners), philosophers and mystics is what really creates the history of the Roman Catholic church.  The authors are particularly fond of Dante, interestingly enough, and quote him regularly.<br />The picture that they paint of the Papacy is one where the primacy of the pope emerged out of political need but also became more corrupt as time went on, culminating in the high middle ages and leading to the Protestant Reformation.  The pope's power has been in decline since then, reaching its all time low when Napoleon conquered the Vatican.  Since then, there has been a considerable amount of theological work done by various persons and councils so as to fully articulate the place of the pope in the life of the church, both preventing abuses of power but also keeping his position the prime position of leadership.  O'Collins and Farrugia discuss the meaning of papal infallibility - developed in recent times - and its precedent in earlier trends and decisions.  However, they note that papal infallibility does *not* mean everything a pope says is perfect or true.  Rather, it means that *when* the pope claims to speak &quot;ex cathedra&quot; - &quot;from the chair (of St. Peter)&quot; - he is and will be correct.  This has only happened *twice*, though.  The pope is presented as a central figure in the Roman Catholic church - he is the central bishop - but not as more important than the larger, shared tradition of Roman Catholicism.<br />Particularly helpful at the end of the book is a list of titles for further reading, some of which I have bought and others which I am planning to buy.  The detailed chapters are welcome to this reader; this book is no lightweight introduction.  I think that cuts both ways, though, as the amount of detail - lovingly and painstakingly written about - may overwhelm some readers.  Regardless, I think this book is still an excellent place to start learning about the Roman Catholic church.	2004-05-07

Pipes then blazes through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the early Enlightenment before getting to Karl Marx, whose writings were - and are - the ideological foundation of Communist thought.  He notes that liberal and communist thought both rest upon the same presuppositions, which Pipes considers to be naive and fundamentally incorrect: that people are basically good and that, if given the opportunity and the education, they will denounce capitalism and create a utopian society.<br />It is worth noting that the history Pipes deals with here is the history of Marxist thought as it developed in Eastern Europe and Russia; it would be accurate to note that this is the &quot;cold current&quot; of Marxist thought.  The &quot;warm current&quot; is what developed in Western Europe and never took on the violent and revolutionary tendencies that Lenin and his followers advocated.<br />Lenin is the principle &quot;bad guy&quot; in Pipes' book, for Pipes spends more time on him than on anyone else.  He has no lack of nasty words to describe Lenin or Stalin but his favorite seems to be &quot;megalomaniac&quot;.  Pipes' view is that since the USSR closed itself off to foreign influence, its leaders, despite their murderous habits, ended up being deified - to their own egotistical destruction.  It's an interesting argument that could - should? - probably be debated, but it's also insightful.<br />Pipes then follows the history of Soviet Socialism, giving rather short attention to the Cold War and the Soviet Union's collapse.  He concludes by noting the various Marxist/Leninist/Communist [frustratingly enough, he fails to really distinguish between them] totalitarian regimes that existed around the world, some of which were Marxist/... in name only.<br />Pipes' books is well worth reading, despite his biases.  His claim to have written Communism's obituary seems a bit overblown, but he certainly points to its eventual death, hoping that it will never return but exist only in nightmares and memories.	2004-04-20
US	50993506	R3P1OSWHFPC0UL	0898702356	356429380	Christian Meditation (English and German Edition)	Books	5	54	55	N	Y	Insightful	One of the best things about this book is what it is not: it is not any type of &quot;how-to&quot; guide (as if God were somehow made accessible through magical-mathematical formulas).  Rather, Hans Urs Von Balthasar offers extended reflections upon the possibility of Christian meditation, the experience of meditation and the meaning of union with God.<br />Although a short read, this is also a demanding read.  Balthasar notes that Christian meditation is fundamentally relational as it takes place between two subjects - the one who meditates and God - but also takes place within the context of the larger community of subjects - the Church.  Christian meditation, then, does not ever allow for any type of abandonment of the world; rather, it leads to an engagement in the world and for the world - just like Christ. <br />Two discussions, in particular, make this book stand out: firstly, the discussion on the silence of God is worth the price of the book alone.  Balthasar writes that the silence of God is always meaningful and that our speech to and about God ultimately culminates in silence - not because it is meaningless, but because it is surpassed.  Silence is not absence but is, instead, a real recognition of presence and participation.<br />Secondly, Balthasar's reflections on union with God take the path of reflection on Mary's reception of the Word of God, which means receiving God's Word and then allowing the Word to be brought forth.  Mary becomes less an object for devotion and more a subject (like other Biblical subjects, but preeminently) to be engaged and whose story is worth reflecting deeply upon.<br />This book is well worth the short amount of time it takes to read, and well worth the direction and perspective it gives to the one who seeks to bear Christ and birth his Presence into the world.	2004-03-15
US	50993506	R1T3ICZGC4KQCF	0060637633	539856310	Basic Writings: Ten Key Essays, plus the Introduction to Being and Time	Books	5	48	56	N	N	Ek-sistence in the Poetic	This book is a collection of 10 + 1 essays (the + 1 being the Introduction to Heidegger's master-piece \\"Being and Time\\") by Martin Heidegger, who may very well be among the most controversial of 20th centurty philosophers.  His controversy is, no doubt, due in part to his brief (10 month) affiliation with the Nazi party between 1933 and 1934; however, the majority of the controversy surrounding him probably has to do with the sheer density of his writing.  Heidegger is not easy to comprehend (grasping the whole); reading him is the pursuit of apprehending (touching the surface).<br />Heidegger does exactly what it is that philosophers are supposed to do by clearing a place in which to ask the question asked long ago by Aristotle (but forgotten - that is, covered over - by \\"philosophers\\"): the question of what it means \\"to be\\".  Part of the problem with reading Heidegger is that his language is almost mystical: constant talk of revealing and concealing within the place of clearing and the ekstasis - the being outside of one's self - of humans which allows for the asking of what it means \\"to be\\".  While a background in philosophy might be helpful to understand Heidegger, it may be more helpful to have a background in religion and Christian mysticism.  Without knowing something of the mystical, Heidegger is bound to appear far more difficult than he actually is.<br />It is worth noting that while Heidegger is dense, he is also a poet.  His aesthetically written grace is much of what gives his contemplations about the question of being such weight and gentle force.  The important thing about reading Heidegger is to do exactly what he counsels one do in observing a work of art: stand outside of yourself and into the clearing of the work of art.  This is what Heidegger refers to as \\"ek-sistence\\": a combination of the words \\"ekstasis\\" and \\"existence\\".  It is like a type of mystical silence that Heidegger invites the reader to: a listening *beyond* what one simply, immediately hears.  This, then, is the key to reading Heidegger: not to read him (an action done first and foremost by the knowing-reading subject), but to simply let him be read - a letting him be in his being.<br />A note on Being: it is all too easy (and all too incorrect) to interpret Heidegger's writings about Being as if he were talking about some sort of subject.  Being, however, is not God or some sort of primal force or the tao or any*thing* else: no, \\"Being\\" as such does not translate from the ancient Greek and Heidegger's constant referral to Being brings the reader to the edge of her/his conceptual limits and, in so doing, creates the clearing that allows for the asking of the question.  Without this clearing, there can be no philosophizing - only the history of [bad] metaphysics (the asking of what reality is), which obscures this fundamental and original question.<br />Heidegger is well worth the time and the effort.  Those that are interested in the simple questions and simple answers will be lost amidst Heidegger's densely poetic thoughts; those that are unwilling to be outside of themselves will find him endlessly frustrating.  Of course, this refusing of ek-sistence into the realm of Being is the fundamental problem with so much of philosophy today: it is lost in [bad] metaphysics, having forgotten the primal question.  If you let him, Heidegger will lead you to the edge of thought where that question can not only be heard, but can be asked again.	2004-03-10

Although Milgram wrote with his eye to the past - he looked back to the Holocaust and to My Lai (he finally wrote the book in 1972, 10 years after the studies were completed) - his voice has proven to be not only prophetic, but of continuing insight and relevance for understanding group dynamics of power and violence.<br />Milgram's studies were done between 1961 and 1962 while he was at Yale; they were all variations on a theme: a unknowing participant (the subject-teacher) was brought to believe that s/he was participating in a learning study.  The other two main participants were a man who posed as the student (the learner) and one who posed as the principal investigator (the authority figure).<br />The subject-teacher was told that the learning would occur in this way: the student would be hooked up to an electric shock generator while the teacher would read a set of word pairs, which the student would repeat back.  When the student missed one of the word pairs, he would be shocked by the &quot;teacher&quot; in increasingly higher shocks (the shocks increased in 15 volt increments), up to 450 volts (which was marked, along with the 435 volt mark, with XXX).<br />The basic goal of the study was to find out how far the &quot;teachers&quot; would go despite the cries, pounding and eventual silence on the part of the students.  The frightening finding was that more often than not, the vast majority of teachers followed through with the command to continue the experiment, which was given by the man acting as the principal investigator every time one of the &quot;teachers&quot; wanted to quit.  [It should be noted, however, that the experiment was designed such that the &quot;student&quot; was never shocked, as the student was an actor, typically in a connected room and could only be heard via microphone.]<br />One of the things that makes reading Milgram's studies so chilling is the scientific exactness of Milgram's own writing style as he describes the studies.  The moral and ethical issues raised in these studies, although addressed by Milgram in his narrating the book, are also expressed in this same mathematically cold style.  It's almost like a bad science fiction movie where our whole human story is narrated - moral failures and all - with robotic precision.  It's unsettling.<br />Of course, it *should* be: any experiment that deals with human interaction on such a violent and perversely authoritarian level ought to get us a bit uncomfortable.  Of course, Milgram also notes that when the subjects were confronted with their own complicitness, they often blamed others or excused themselves in some way.  It really does give a tremendous insight into the psychology of human beings: when faced with our own evil, we try to excuse it rather than deal with it.<br />If, at the end of reading Milgram's book, we aren't questioning ourselves and our ability to be violent and to promote the spread of violence by being passive, we have missed the entire point of the book.  Milgram's goal is to not simply report the collection and analysis of data, but to engage the reader on a fundamentally moral level.  He cites Hannah Arendt's work Eichman in Jerusalem and notes that evil is not necessarily expressed in a pro-active way; indeed, it can be far more subtle but no less dangerous.<br />Milgram's book is one well worth the effort.  It reveals an element of human being that is so easy to forget, especially given that our culture is so bent on *denying* any element of - or at least any potential for - evil within ourselves.  Of course, such blindness to the reality of evil and tragedy is what makes *letting it happen* so easy.	2004-03-04
US	50993506	R67Y8RSMZSQPC	0195168917	53052700	The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity	Books	5	9	13	N	N	A Universal Faith in the Global Village	I used this book as one of my primary sources for studying religions in the global village; it was tremendously useful and is a rather fascinating introduction to what is a far more complex issue.  Jenkins writes with a certain level of zeal for the diversification that is currently taking place within Christendom, particularly in the Global South; he also writes sympathetically - and some might even say supportively - of the spreading of the Christian faith.  (My understanding is that Jenkins is an Anglo-Catholic.)    Jenkins' proposal, now several years old, is that Christianity is growing fastest in the Global South - Africa, Latin America, and South Asia - in such a way that the strongholds of Christian orthodoxy are likely to be found in the Global South by the middle of the 21st century, rather than in the West.  (Whether or not this means ecclesial power - \\"power\\" being a reductive Western idea - is not touched upon.)  While the United States is something of an anomaly for the secularization thesis to try and explain, in Europe it seems to hold true that the more educated a culture becomes, the less religious it becomes.    Of course, it is tremendously Eurocentric to assume that the growing religiosity in the Global South is directly related to their sub-Western standards of educational and economic development.  Rather, what Jenkins points to is the perception of demonic forces and the fact that a separation of the \\"natural\\" from the \\"super natural\\" has not taken place in those regions.  In light of a world that very much believes in spiritual forces of evil, the spiritual forces of good - embodied in Jesus Christ - become a necessity for combatting that evil.  And, more importantly, the fact that exorcism of the demonic seems to work further demonstrates the truth of Christianity.    Hence, one of the more interesting features of Christianity in the Global South is that both Pentecostals and Roman Catholics - the two fastest growing groups in the Global South - will believe in the supernatural, which creates a common ground between the two groups in the area of praxis, rather than theoria.  Yet, Jenkins proposes that when it comes to theology (as well as morality), both groups will be more conservative in relation to what constitutes orthodoxy for their particular group.    The only major problem with this work - and this is a difference that has only come to be seen in recent months, I think - is that Jenkins paints the Global South with a broad brush.  The Global South appears almost monolithic in terms of morality and theology, yet in light of the recent crisis in the Anglican Communion over gay bishop Gene Robinson, it is worth noting that several of the Primates in Africa were for ending the ban on homosexuals in the priesthood - a total affront to the seeming \\"conservativism\\" that is supposed to be so characteristic of the Global South.  While such bishops do not seem to represent any type of majority opinion found there, it does show that a certain level of differance does exist which should be accounted for.    Of course, Christianity in the Global South is a topic that people are just beginning to study.  In light of that, it is easy to understand why that which seems to be \\"other\\" - or at least \\"new\\" - in some way can be painted more simplistically than it really is.  Yet, Jenkins seeks to understand his subject and does not portray Christianity in the Global South as an utterly foreign object (unlike some postcolonialists or liberals in the United States such as John Shelby Spong).  Jenkins' book is an excellent place to start for anyone interested in learning more about crucial developments in Christianity today - especially those that will likely shape the future.	2004-02-26

As those who have read him know, Paul is not always the easiest to follow, especially given his intricate weaving together of different styles of thought within his letters: Pharisaic/Rabbinic, Hellenistic, apocalyptic and early Christian.<br />This book covers what you would expect a &quot;companion&quot; to cover: Paul's life and context, historiographical issues, his letters and his purported letters (the &quot;deutero-Pauline epistles&quot;: those letters in the New Testament that most scholars do not believe were written by Paul).  However, several other essays whose topics might be unexpected - such as interpretations of Paul in the second century (the most enjoyable and fascinating essay in the book for this particular reader) - also find their way into the book.<br />While many simply see Paul as some sort of proto-Reformation-era de-/re-former (a la Luther), this book moves beyond these tired (and, it would seem at this point, largely incorrect) interpretations of Paul.  Paul is not so easily reduced to a late-Medieval Roman Catholic reformer; he stands - however ambiguously and uncomfortably (for us no less than him!) - without such hermeneutical concealing.  Rather than preach a reductive &quot;doctrine of justification&quot;, Paul emerges from his letters (via this book) as being someone who has a rather mystical understanding of the eucharist as union, sees salvation as pertaining to a particular community (not merely individuals), and preaches &quot;justification&quot; as being far more than a type of legal status: it is being brought into the family of God (via baptism) as a child of God, participating now in God's new work in the world.  The reduction of Paul to legal[-istic?] terminology fails to see him as a member of a community who preached to and from that community; it ignores the fundamentally relational element of Paul's thought.<br />This book is well worth the read.  It is not difficult reading, but having read Paul first will greatly increase what you pull from this book.  While it may be true that Paul has managed to upset just about everyone since the time of his writing, these essays are highly informative and helpful &quot;for those with ears to hear&quot;.  The Cambridge Companion to St. Paul engages and mediates him well.	2004-02-18

Webber begins, quite naturally, with the early church and then goes on to talk briefly about the Medieval period before getting to the Reformation, which is when the Anglican church (which the Episcopal church is a part of) began.<br />Webber's insights into the crisis of the Reformation are helpful.  He expresses far more succinctly - yet no less compellingly - some of the main problems with the Reformation view of the Bible and church authority, mainly that people turned away from a centralized authority that prescribed Christian life in black and white terms to a textual authority written thousands of years ago that usually didn't prescribe such simple rules to follow.<br />The Anglican - and therefore Episcopal - way of overcoming this was by using three things in determining its doctrine: scripture, tradition and reason.  Although the latter of the three is far more subjective than the other two, this is what gives Anglicanism its double-edged sword: a larger community that is open to discussion about many issues yet remains a community nonetheless (well, at least in theory).<br />Webber's short take on Episcopal - Anglicanism in the United States - history is equally fascinating.  It is interesting to read how much American isolationism/independence played into the views that people had of the Church in America; despite all of this, however, the Episcopal church grew.<br />The other sections of the book deal with other areas of history as well as more basic, overarching principles such as the use of the Book of Common Prayer and the structure of the Episcopal church as itself and as a part of the larger Anglican communion.  It is interesting to note that the Episcopal church was the first large church to ordain a African-American to the priesthood; the Episcopal church was also the first large church to ordain women to the priesthood.  It would seem that being &quot;progressive&quot; (a term I don't like, but that most people understand) is well-rooted in the Episcopal church's past.<br />This book is brief, but it is well written and has several recommendations for further reading in the back of the book.  Although a little more detail would have been nice, as would have been a bit more attention to current issues of crisis and division within the church, I imagine that some of that can be found in other works.  Overall, this is a great introduction.	2003-12-27

After all, isn't the whole point of the icon - so vital to Orthodox spirituality - recognizing that the boundaries that we draw cannot be the totality of revelation but instead operate as an open door - a window - to an experience of the Holy?  I find the hard-line Orthodox views expressed below to be disappointing; having heard Fr. Peter Gillquist speak at the University of Florida recently, I am glad to know that not all Orthodox feel the same way about other Christians.  As one Church Father put it - and it has become a rule of thumb in many Orthodox circles, as well as for those outside of Orthodoxy - &quot;We know where the church is; we do not know where the church is not.&quot;<br />Of course, the Orthodox below raise a good point about the nature of ecumenism and the crisis that has come about in many ecumenical discussions: in looking for a common ground, many end up sacrificing all that makes them distinctive and one is left with something of a theological mush rather than anything substantive.  Fortunately, the differences here are mentioned, just as the similarities are.  Real discussion about real issues - such as the filioque - are discussed by both Orthodox and Roman Catholic theologians; one gets a feel for both sides of an issue that remains divisive today.<br />The book falls short, though, in two ways.  Firstly, the Evangelicals are, in my opinion, not shown in the best light.  That is, they do not portray themselves in the best light.  J. I. Packer leaves much to be desired; Carl Braaten does the same.  Perhaps the problem, though, is what Mark Noll discusses in his book _The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind_: there is no Evangelical mind.  Evangelicals consistently portray themselves to have less and less to really offer other than a simplistic - and oftentimes uninformed - Biblicism; there is no real engagement with any tradition or history and this lack of roots results in a lack of creative engagement with the problems of the day.  A notable exception is the work of someone such as Stanley J. Grenz; perhaps future ecumenical writings will consider including him as he may be one of the best - or at least most informed - minds in Evangelicalism today.<br />Secondly, this book does little to represent Anglicanism.  Although J. I. Packer is (= calls himself?) an Anglican, his theology is so un-Anglican that one might rightly wonder what, if anything, his Anglicanism really means.  Some say, perhaps rightly, that there is no Anglican theology proper but that there is Anglican worship proper and that Anglican worship proper is contained in the Book of Common Prayer.  Hence, the Book of Common Prayer should feature heavily in discussions of Anglicanism.  However, for Packer it does not and since Packer is the only Anglican in the book, this means that Anglicanism as such figures little into these discussions when Anglicanism - despite the problems in the American church - really ought to figure far more prominently (it is, after all, the second largest Christian church in the world!).<br />Caveats aside, this is a great book.  Although hard-line Orthodox may see any participation in ecumenism as &quot;betrayal&quot;, such hard-liners are at the margins of Orthodoxy and offer little to the world at large.  This book provides a great introduction to the main differences between three large Christian churches - Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Evangelical - as well as an introduction to common ground between them.  Highly recommended.	2003-12-07

This is welcome.  Yet, in focusing so much on socio-historical issues, Ernst ends up sacrificing the larger picture of what it is that Sufism is about phenomenologically and theologically.<br />Ernst does explain some things quite well, though, such as the development of Sufi orders, the role of the shaik to the disciple, art, dance, and meditation practices.  Particularly fascinating is the brief discussion on the relationship between Islamic fundamentalism and Sufism.  Sufism is viewed by the fundamentalists as a type of heretical pseudo-Islam, and the Sufis have been persecuted and killed in many places by over-zealous fundamentalists.  What Ernst's book shows is that many of these supposedly heretical practices are actually rather traditional expressions of Islamic mysticism and spirituality, with roots stretching back quite far.<br />Socio-historical perspectives aside, though, you won't learn much about the spirit of Sufism.  For that, I would recommend Annemarie Schimmel's _Mystical Dimensions of Islam_ as an excellent place to start.  Then, for a greater insight into socio-historical issues, you may continue with reading Ernst's book.	2003-11-28

It is an unusual argument in that it ascribes far more to the lives of &quot;regular&quot; Christians than it does to theological elites such as Justin Martyr or Origen or to political powers such as Constantine.<br />How were Christians more virtuous than the pagans of later Roman times?  Well Christian social outreach did a lot for the marginalized; in fact, the Roman welfare system paled in comparison to that offered by Christians.  This greater outreach meant that Christians were able to spread their faith more; the faith in action made a compelling argument for its validity.<br />The place of the marginalized is important here.  Applying his work among the Moonies and other new religious movements, Stark argues that Christians won converts by being out among the marginalized folk and forming relationships with them.  He backs this up historically, however, by quoting Church Fathers such as Tertullian, who notes that Christians were doing just that.  Borrowing from choice theory, Stark writes that one of the reasons for converting to Christianity was because not converting cost a whole lot more than converting; that is, if the pagans don't like you, why not become a Christian when the Christians do like you?  It makes total sense.<br />One caveat, though, is the lack of discussion about theory and method.  I wonder how accurate it is to use contemporary sociological theory to describe the events and societal developments of the past; I wonder (openly - it is something I would like to discuss) about how the method of applying current discoveries to the past may work for good and/or for ill.  Hence, my rating of 4 rather than 5 stars: a more in-depth discussion of theory and method would have been appreciated.<br />Of course, no historical or sociological study ever stands alone.  Stark has written a fascinating study of early Christianity and how it may have won over the Roman empire that is really quite compelling and well worth reading.  Virtue may still have a place in the larger society.	2003-11-22

Although it is obvious that the author feels very strongly about Anglicanism and that it has a rich history, his writing lacks the persuasiveness and clarity of vision that the title would imply.<br />Anglican theology, in reading this book, seems to have been most shaped by the Book of Common Prayer and the sacramental theology of Cyril of Jerusalem, which is neither fully Roman Catholic nor fully Protestant (rather, it is the best of both); the idea of the Anglican church as a type of &quot;via media&quot; (middle way) is present throughout Griffis' book.  He then goes on to talk a bit about the Oxford movement, the mid-20th century the push towards social engagement and social justice, and how the Anglican church allows for a critical inquiry into various issues that may result in not taking the Scriptures or the Tradition/s at full face value; Griffis' vision of Anglicanism is one that leaves possibilities open.<br />Griffis repeatedly notes that there is a lot of disagreement in the Anglican church, most notably on issues of abortion, homosexuality, and the place of women in the church (and if that doesn't really cover most of the spectrum of controversial issues today, I don't know what does).  This lack of vision - this lack of agreement - is what really left me thinking that, at the very least, Griffis lacks vision; at most, Anglicanism lacks vision.<br />Although the *idea* of a church that leaves room open for discussion is very attractive, there seems far less room for discussion on many matters than Griffis would presume (if, of course, the threats of much of the Global South to break off communion with many of the churches in the West means anything); perhaps his view is representative more of the liberal (= Western? = bourgeios?) desire for &quot;discussion&quot; - or, perhaps more accurately, license - about what have traditionally been issues of morals that were agreed upon by the vast majority of Christians.<br />Griffis' vision of Anglicanism may very well tear the Anglican communion apart.	2003-11-22

Although it may be short, this little book whets the appetite and leaves the reader wanting more.  Mark Noll is one of the most well-known and well-respected scholars of Evangelicalism in the United States and handles his little project here quite well.<br />Noll breaks up the book into time periods, beginning with a bit about the Protestant Reformation before continuing with pre-1776 American Protestantism; he discusses the Civil War, the rise of so-called Fundamentalism, and ends with discussing secularization and other recent developments.  The book is easy reading - one can read it in a few hours - and well worth taking the time to do so, especially in light of the continued presence of religion in American public life.<br />What I found most fascinating in this book was how American Protestantism groups so quickly divided into more groups because of a lack of government involvement. Whereas in Europe different churches came to be allied with the government of their region, this did not happen in the United States.  Instead, a type of individualistic turn took place when Protestantism/s reached America's shores: if you didn't like how your church did it, you simply went off and started another one.  Hence, in America there are tens of thousands of Protestant denominations that never existed in Europe.<br />If you have read Noll's work _The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind_, you will hear echoes of it in his analysis of what exactly Evangelicalism is (and, for that matter, isn't).  He writes that Evangelicals have, for most of their history, been fairly skeptical of higher education and taking a more thoughtful approach to the faith; a type of American pragmatism exists within American Evangelicalism.  Yet, Noll is also sympathetic (he himself is an Evangelical) and desires to correct various misperceptions about Evangelicalism that are widespread in the larger culture.  Noll's corrective lenses are both helpful and informative.<br />Although it is short, I think this book is a really fantastic introduction into a subject with widespread influence: religious, cultural and political.  For those that are interested, Noll includes a fairly substantial bibliography in the back of the book with a number of recommendations for futher reading.  And, given the 60% discount that Amazon.com is currently offering, this is probably the most informative $5.00 that you can spend right now.	2003-11-22

The entire work is actually Clamence's own narrative, which makes reading it more like listening to a type of confession; at the very least it is like being on the recieving end of a conversation.<br />As the title indicates, this books plays off of Christian themes heavily.  The very idea of &quot;the fall&quot; is a fundamentally Christian notion of lost innocence (which is very much at the heart of this work); &quot;Jean-Baptiste&quot; - &quot;John [the] Baptist&quot; in English - describes himself as a type of prophet crying in the wilderness but refusing to come forth; the bar he frequents is described as a church (and one could argue that, by extension, his life in the bar is something of a participation in an inverted communion); entire discussions about redemption, forgiveness, and repentance fill the pages of this work.<br />Despite all of its religious imagery and imagination, however, it is a work that is completely devoid of any notions of real redemption, forgiveness or love.  Clamence's/Camus' view is basically that this world is, indeed, fallen but that there is nothing else.  <br />It is interesting that an entire discussion about the death of God takes place within this book.  As Camus - like Nietzsche before him - notes, without God all meaning and transcendence is lost.  The picture Camus paints of such a world is indeed compelling if God is dead; as Clamence says - tragically - at the end of the book, he would permit himself everything all over again but without laughter the next time.  A world devoid of laughter is a world devoid of love; a world devoid of love is a world devoid of transcendence; a world devoid of transcendence is a world devoid of God.<br />This book is a heavy work that attempts to carry the weight of the world upon its existential shoulders.  It is one of the better places to start if one is interested in getting a feel for existentialist philosophy and literature, as well as a post-Nietzschean worldview.<br />Upon finishing this book, one should listen closely to the sounds of a haunting silence, born of a world without laughter, and ask one's self whether or not that silence is compelling.  Is it what one wants to hear?  Is it what one does in fact hear?  Perhaps ironically, it is only in such absence that the whisper of faith, hope, and love can be heard; indeed, fallenness cannot be the totality of being.<br />A viewpoint that denies laughter is, in the end, a viewpoint worth looking past, over, and beyond: in short, transcending.	2003-09-14

Furthermore, it is not a study on early Christian mystics - the mystics in this book cover almost a thousand years, from the 3rd through the 12th centuries.  This book is also not the fourth volume of McGinn's four-volume The Presence of God: A History of Western Christian Mysticism, although it does at points expand a bit on what McGinn has written in the three already-published volumes in that series.<br /><br />This book deals with 12 Christian mystics - 1 Celtic, 5 Greek and 6 Latin - and introduces some of their key ideas to the reader so that the reader may gain from their insights and progress further down the spiritual path.  This is a contemplative introduction to some of the more important ideas from some of the more important mystics of the Christian tradition.<br /><br />The book is broken up into two parts, with six mystics in each part.  The mystics in the first part of the book, which deals with practices for finding God, are:<br /><br />Origen (Greek) - Scripture<br />Evagrius Ponticus (Greek) - Contemplation<br />John Cassian (Greek) - Prayer and Purity of Heart<br />Gregory the Great (Latin) - Repentance<br />Hildegard of Bingen (Latin) - Visionary Experience<br />Richard of St. Victor (Latin) - Modes of Contemplation<br /><br />The mystics in the second half of the book, which deals with transformation in God, are:<br /><br />Gregory of Nyssa (Greek) - Endless Pursuit and Transformation<br />Augustine of Hippo (Latin) - The Body of Christ<br />Dionysius (Greek) - Mystical Theology<br />John the Scot (Celtic/Greek/Latin) - Nature as Revelation<br />Bernard of Clairvaux (Latin) - Spousal Love<br />William of St. Thierry (Latin) - Living the Trinity<br /><br />Each chapter places the mystic in his/her historical context before proceeding on to talk about their distinctive teachings; each chapter ends with a bibliography for further reading, citing both translations of primary texts as well as relevant secondary readings.<br /><br />This book is a great place to start if one has little or no knowledge of the Christian mystics and one wishes to grow spiritually.  The spiritual depth and integrity of these mystics will be relevant to you wherever you are and it is for this reason that this book is worth reading.

Although this work is less theological than a book such as _Resurrection: Interpreting the Easter Gospel_ (the other book by him that I have read), it is nonetheless still relevant as it finds its roots in a Christian worldview.<br />What I find both interesting and refreshing about the Archbishop is that he seems far more willing to listen to both sides of an issue than many other religious thinkers.  I have heard him referred to as a &quot;post-liberal&quot;; although the usage of the word &quot;post&quot; is all too chic these days, it does seem to designate a type of continuity with a tradition while at the same time a certain level of discomfort with it.  Particularly refreshing is his brief discussion about the use of the word &quot;choice&quot; in abortion debates and how the use of the word &quot;choice&quot; presupposes the action/s of an individual are divorced from a social context.  Such an understanding of &quot;choice&quot; is, of course, naive; the result of such thinking can all too quickly become an ethics of power, which is contrary to so much of feminist ethics.<br />Williams seems to have a particular interest in language and its place in community, culture, and relationships - not in the purely romantic sense, but in the more general sense of relating one person to an other.  He notes several times the place of language in expressing and sharing one's self with others and how certain dispositions - such as a lack of remorse - result in the inability to accurately and fully articulate one's existence in language to another person.  His points are well thought out and touch something deep within not only the self, but within the soul as well (for a fuller discussion of the soul and the self, read the last chapter).<br />Disappointingly, the layout of this book is rather frustrating - there are several formatting errors that are completely unnecessary.  While the Archbishop's writing makes this book well worth the read, it would have been nice if those that formatted the book had done a higher quality job - a job that matched the Archbishop's work.<br />All in all though, this book is another one by Rowan Williams that is well worth reading - and, perhaps as another reviewer has written, worth reading twice.	2003-08-16
US	50993506	R2ADL28FXMIL9U	0226791424	232059014	Erring: A Postmodern A/theology	Books	3	44	50	N	Y	A/Theology...A/Theist: A (Without) + Theos (God) (=Nihilism)	Firstly, this is a book well worth the time to read.  Although I have only given it three stars, that does not mean that it is not worth your time.  In fact, I think it is fully worth anyone's time that has an interest in theology and/or postmodernism.<br />The reason that I have given it 3 stars is because in the end, Taylor's text (not book!) is little more than an excursion into a/theological nihilism (&quot;a/theological nihilism&quot; is not at all redundant, as you will see upon finishing this book).  It is fundamentally Nietzschean - and by extension arguably pagan - in its orientation and in its (proudly self-proclaimed) erring results.<br />Taylor begins the book with an engagement with St. Augustine via Augustine's seminal work The Confessions.  This first section of the book sets up the second section of the book, which is the postmodern de-construction of Augustine and Western Christianity's understanding of Truth.  By emptying all discourse of God, Taylor notes (following Nietzsche) that texts lose their meaning and the self eventually loses its value and disappears.  There is no meaning in a world without God; it is the job of the a/theologian to chart, then, the meaningless, purposeless, &quot;erring&quot; wanderings of an individual in a world without meaning.  The second part a/concludes (so to write) with an attempt to find a way to navigate the chaotic sea of nihilism (the result of denying God) without its own results being nihilistic.  Taylor, however, like Nietzsche, is left without any way out of the fundamentally nihilistic world that he advocates.<br />Taylor roots contemporary nihilism in Christianity, specifically in its ideas of Scripture and the Incarnation.  If God empties God's-self into the Logos (&quot;logos&quot; is the Greek word for &quot;Word&quot;, specifically a word that is spoken with the intention of communicating something true; more immediately relevant to Taylor is St. John's usage of the word &quot;logos&quot; to refer to Christ as *the* Logos of God the Father) and the Logos is crucified - Taylor refers to this as a &quot;radical Christology&quot; - then it only follows, in Taylor's mind, that nihilism should be the result of this sort of theological claim.<br />Naturally problematic is the absence of resurrection in Taylor's a/theology, but more glaring is his refusal to even question the assumptions made by Nietzsche and his various followers (particularly Barthes and Derrida).  Taylor buys Nietzsche hook, line and sinker but selectively engages the Christian tradition; such a combination makes such a/theology possible.<br />A more thorough engagement with Christianity - and with the Logos of Christianity - would give Taylor far less room to create his a/theology in.  His exclusive focus on the *text* of Scripture, to the exclusion of ritual and rite - particularly as exemplified in the giving and partaking of the Eucharist - shows a Protestant bent that exists largely on the margin of the Christian tradition.<br />If one removes the apophatic and iconic understanding of Scripture and instead focuses on it as a totality, then Taylor's work makes good sense and is a thorough and necessary critique; if there is no transcendence, one is indeed trapped within the text and bound to &quot;err endlessly&quot;.  Every text is bound to become a context of a context of a context (ad infinitum, ad nauseum) if the finite text is a totality.<br />It makes far more sense though, when looking at Christianity, to see that Taylor's justifications for his a/theology are really the result of a rejection of Christianity and it Logos, rather than being the fruit of something inherent to Christianity itself.  This is a book worth reading, but it is also worth critiquing.  In the end, Taylor's book (inadvertently, I suspect) shows the need for an apophatic, iconic understanding of language and texts, not the need to dispose of these; Taylor shows the need for a real engagement and practice of a sacramental Christianity - one which has at its center participation in the Transcendent as the ground of its being.  It is only then that discourse and meaning can be given and received; it is only then that nihilism - &quot;the strangest of guests&quot; (to quote Nietzsche) - is exiled to err endlessly in its own purposelessness.	2003-08-16

I then did an independent study of Sufism, which is what sparked my interest in Islam enough to read The Koran, its central text.<br />Although I cannot comment on the other reviewers' differing views on the accuracy of this translation, I can write that this translation does convey something of the thunderous power that Muhammad's earliest listeners must have heard and experienced when these suras (speeches - the Koran is a collection of 114 speeches given by Muhammad, which Muslims believe were revelations given to him by God) were first delivered.<br />There are a number of things that one could mention content-wise, as each sura deals with something slightly different.  God, women, human relationships, one's relationship to the non-believing world, Judaism, Christianity, and Arabic paganism are all touched upon in the Koran (along with other topics).  It reads much like the Bible at points, and many of the more familiar Biblical stories are here, along with extra-Biblical legends.  The Koran really isn't a bizarre religious text, but very much belongs to the genealogy of monotheistic, prophetic writings.<br />One of the things that I really liked about this particular translation was the way that Dawood cross-referenced relevant Biblical texts from both the Tanak/Old Testament and the New Testament.  The footnotes detailing Arabic pagan practice were also helpful, as were the footnotes giving basic historical information.  One certainly gets a feel for where the Koran was coming from and who it was going to when it was first delivered.<br />In reading this, it is worth reflecting on how a passage can lend itself to multiple interpretations.  There are very few passages in the Koran that make any mention of war, and far more passages that assert that one should leave judgment to God.  Yet, in our own time, these passages on war seem to be used -in some circles, at least - far more often than the passages that counsel one to merely give warning and leave the rest to God.<br />I think that the Koran is worth reading, especially given the current socio-political climate and I found this particular translation to be helpful due to Dawood's many footnotes.  Regardless of the translation you end up buying, at least check this one out as it will give you an important insight into the world of the early Muslims, which continues to shape our world today.	2003-07-15

While it is an intellectually demanding work, it is a work that is deeply rewarding on intellectual, personal and spiritual levels.<br />Williams' basic thesis is that the resurrection of Christ is central to the Christian message.  He does not write this to downplay the crucifixion, but to show that the darkness of the crucifixion is brought to its fullness and completion in the resurrection.  Williams illustrates this in multiple ways, but there are two in particular that I want to note below.<br />The first is Williams' engagement with original sin in the sense of personal guilt.  It is only after we confront ourselves and see both our ability to victimize others and that we have actually done so that we can then turn to God through Christ and experience redemption.<br />The second, the idea of a redeemed language, is an idea that is very much central to this book.  Even though the fullness of the resurrection may escape our words (and Williams uses the historical discrepancies in the resurrection narratives in the Gospels to illustrate this), this does not mean that our words are meaningless.  Instead, our words are given meaning because they are rooted in a fullness that cannot be contained by them.  The resurrection, so to speak, re-inspires our language.<br />As others have noted, Williams displays an incredible gift for synthesizing various strands of Christian thought into a brilliant whole without sacrificing any part of it.  Liturgical practice and mystical theology, contemporary biblical criticism and philosophical acuity all meet in Williams' work in the best of ways.  Despite his controversies, it may be true that the Archbishop Williams is one of the best voices in contemporary theology.  This book certainly leads me to think so.	2003-07-05

While it is not the best book in this series - it should have been longer - it is still a good read and worth the $... you'll spend for it.<br />The best thing about this book is that, rather than just focus on Plato's own philosophy, generous mention is also given to his place in culture and the history of the interpretation of his works.  More than anything, this makes for a more enjoyable read, but it also gives us a clue as to how certain practices and ideas that are still current today have (at least some of) their roots in Plato.<br />However, when it comes to Plato's own thought about different things, this book is a bit lacking.  His theory of the forms is given short mention, while an entire chapter is devoted to his views on sexuality.  Given our current cultural milieu, such a focus on sexuality is indeed interesting, but was sex really so central to Plato's philosophy?<br />While it is important to note the differences between his own culture and ours, it is more important to note the main currents of his thought, especially given the constraints on length for this book (the subtitle is, after all, \\"A Very Short Introduction\\").  If she had explained his most important and most famous ideas more, such a focus would not seem so disproportionately out of place.<br />Yet, it is also worth noting that Annas' goal seems to be to write a book that is simply a good place to *start*.  The book ends with an invitation to do philosophy rather than to simply know about it which is, so to speak, in the very spirit of Plato himself.	2003-07-05

Rather than presenting a new, scholarly engagement of the Gospel of John and the Gospel of Thomas, Pagels scatters heavy doses of her own personal beliefs between her rehashing of previously developed theses.  Simply put, she has nothing new to say on a scholarly level, but plenty to say autobiographically.  <br />Dr. Pagels seems to be someone who is thoroughly disenchanted with Christianity, particularly of the evangelical persuasion.  In this book proposes that if GThom had been included in the canon of the New Testament, then Christianity would have been \\"nicer\\": it would have allowed for more individuality, promoted women more, and been less \\"oppressive\\".  Such an argument reads like an exercise in creative writing; it is, indeed, imaginative.  However, such an argument is nothing more than speculation - how could such an argument be proven?  It can't be.  But, this semi-scholarly work by Pagels doesn't rely on the concreteness of its thought or the use of its sources.<br />In fact, it is downright bizarre that GThom and Gnosticism are used as sources for her own personal vendetta against Christianity when GThom says that women cannot enter the kingdom of Heaven unless they make themselves male.  Having heard her speak on this particular saying several months ago at the University of Florida, it is clear to me that her selective use of Gnostic texts to support a de-centered, feminist Christianity cannot really stand on its own when left to face its Gnostic sources.<br />If you are interested in learning about Dr. Pagels' personal life, personal gripes, tragedies, and spiritual path, this is a great book to start out with.  However, if you are looking to really learn about the Gospel of Thomas, look elsewhere.  Reading Richard Valantasis' translation of the Gospel of Thomas would be a good place to start.	2003-06-05

Oden	Books	2	19	28	N	Y	&quot;Ancient&quot; is NOT &quot;Postmodern&quot;	I have begun to notice something of a trend among books on postmodernism by Evangelicals (with the exception of Stanley Grenz): they don't really engage postmodernism.  Sure, they talk a little bit about relativism and how that is dangerous; they throw a few jabs at the Englightenment; they note the necessity of humility.  However, they never really engage Foucault, Lyotard, Derrida, or Nietzsche.<br />This is a shame, too, because after reading the essays in this volume, you can tell that the early Church Fathers - and, if this volume is reflective of current Evangelical engagements with early Christianity, the Greek Fathers in particular - have been thoroughly engaged.  The Evangelicals in this book have paid a lot of attention to the work of the Greek Fathers, noting the details, the depth and profundity of their work.<br />The books greatest strength is its essays on the Greek Fathers.  From St. Maximus the Confessor to St. John Chrysostom, Evagrius of Ponticus to St. Clement, there are some really deep engagements with the early Church.  In addition, there are also several essays on ecumenism which are, in the heart and mind of this reviewer, worth reading.<br />But, I again find myself wondering what is up with the whole &quot;postmodern&quot; thing that the title proclaims this book is about.  I think it is this: there are a few essays in this book that deal with some various aspects of a general cultural shift that is called - fairly or unfairly - &quot;postmodern.&quot;  So, there is an essay about the Church as a community, and another essay about the importance of Tradition (by Stanley Grenz, which has already appeared in his book Beyond Foundationalism).<br />Of course, anyone who has studied postmodernism knows that community and tradition are really not a part of the postmodern program; rather, they are attacked by postmodernity.  What I am guessing is that these essays were written to help indicate a solution to the problems of fragmentation of hyper-individualism.  This does seem to be typical of some trends within Evangelicalism: to see postmodernity as a way of bringing out elements in the faith that have been long forgotten.  The essay on the Eucharist being a postmodern &quot;possibility&quot; for Evangelicals is an expression of this trend.<br />Yet, &quot;possibility&quot; leaves quite a bit to be desired.  Do Evangelicals see themselves needing to reinvent their faith to follow the changing of the culture?  Or, do they see themselves as having a really solid rock upon which they can engage the culture?  The idea of a eucharistic celebration within an Evangelical church is certainly interesting, but in the end it would be a complete overhaul of the faith.  Is this overhaul being advocated because it is a turn towards deeper Truth or because it &quot;makes sense&quot; in a postmodern context?  The latter option, from a theological perspective, is disturbing if it is the reason for such a suggestion.<br />This book has some great essays about the Greek Fathers and ecumenism.  However, its engagement with postmodernism is weak at best, and on a rather shaky ground at that.  If you come to this book thinking that it is going to be about postmodernism, you will be disappointed (assuming you know a thing or two about postmodernism).  But, if you want some insights into the Greek Fathers and ecumenism, this is a fine place to start.  Indeed, it is almost a gem.	2003-04-12

And, what is more, this volume is the first of three volumes, so if one desires to read the entire set, one will have not only a historical understanding of Christianity, but a real insight into the Christian worldview - a real insight into the heart of Christianity.<br />The way that this volume is divided up is worth noting: the first part deals with more historical and sociological data - movements and the like - while the second section deals with the spiritual insights and understandings of different people at different times.  Both sections complement each other quite well.  Furthermore, within each section focus is made upon both the Eastern and Western traditions so that one gets a more rounded picture of Christianity.<br />It is nice, too, to notice the illustrations in the book.  Although they are not in color, they are attractive and worth a second and third look.  Such illustrations certainly help to portray various Christian understandings just as well as the essays do.  After all, &quot; a picture is worth a thousand words.&quot;<br />The essay on Gnosticism is especially worth noting, as it seeks to answer the question of whether Gnosticism is a legitimate expression of the Christian faith.  The answer - which is negative - is given in a genuinely thoughtful way, where both similarities and differences are noted.  Gnostic scholars of Gnosticism (such as Elaine Pagels) oftentimes do not really appreciate the real differences that existed between Gnosticism and proto-Orthodox Christianity.  This essay does a fine job of surveying those differences.<br />The other essays in this collection are all first rate; the essay entitled &quot;The Spiritual Message of the Great Fathers&quot; is a well written survey of some of the 4th and 5th century Church Fathers.  The essay comparing Eastern and Western views onthe Trinity is also illuminating, especially since it shows that what has long been fought over between the East and the West (since Photios, in particular - see below) may not be so important.<br />The only thing that I would have done differently would have been to add an actual essay about the Photian schism - a schism in the ninth century that was led by an Eastern bishop named Photios.  The accusations leveled against the Roman Church by Photios are still repeated today; Photios is a saint in the Eastern church but considered a heretic in the Western church.  More information on this development and its ramifications for Eastern Orthodox spirituality would have been welcome.<br />In the end, I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone who has any desire to learn about the Christian faith in both the East and West during Christianity's first millenia.  For both the scholar and the layperson, it is a valuable reference guide, sketching out some of the more prominent contours of Christian spirituality.	2003-03-20

It is written almost as an apologetic for Islam; in retrospect, Armstrong's reporting looks more and more biased.  Although the bias isn't so ridiculous that one wants to throw the book across the room, it isn't so great that I would recommend it as a great place to start on Islam, either.<br />For one, Armstrong is very interested in contrasting Islam and Christianity.  She notes throughout the book that Islam is less interested in orthodoxy than orthopraxy.  However, anyone with any knowledge of Sufism - a mystical stream within Islamic thought - knows that the Sufis were regularly persecuted and martyred for their beliefs.  Although Christianity may focus on theology to a larger extent than Islam does, that does *not* mean in any way that Islam is not interested in theological discourse.<br />Secondly, Armstrong seems very interested in portraying Islam in the best possible light.  Islam has had great periods of tolerance but, like any other religion, it has also had violence perpetrated in its own name.  In all truth, Islam is no more or less violent than any other religion.  She notes that the Crusades were a defense launched by the West against Islam, but only devotes about 1 page to the Crusades (which is odd, since she has written a tome about them).  One is left not knowing what happened and so a big piece of Islamic history is left out, as are questions about why the Muslims were invading in the first place.<br />She also seems interested in putting her own value judgments onto Islamic history.  She writes that after Muhammad, Islam was \\"hijacked by men\\" which comes across less like a well thought out discussion of the history of women in Islam and more like a knee-jerk reaction.  A lot of Muslim women like that they are not expected to be like men in Islam - most of the Muslim women I have known have felt that way.  That a white Westerner such as Armstrong wants to impose ideas of equality upon a different culture seems rather arrogant and imperialistic.<br />All of this is not to say that this book is a waste, however.  It contains a lot of information and is a pretty intense read.  The development of fundamentalism is certainly interesting, as are the deviations that Islamic fundamentalism was considered to have when it first arose.  However, the trends in Islamic thought that gave rise to Islamic fundamentalism are not noted.  As any scholar of religion would tell you, texts leave themselves open for interpretation, for better or for worse.  The developments that led to Islamic fundamentalism aren't  noted, which is a disappointment.<br />This book is an okay place to start if you plan to do more study on Islam.  However, if you are looking for a one-time introduction, I suggest that you look elsewhere (John Esposito's book Islam: The Straight Path would be a better place to start).	2003-03-20

It is, in actuality, 144 pages - and it is a detailed 144 pages, too.  This is actually the first book I ever read that got me interested in the thought of the early Church Fathers and it is a great introduction to St. Augustine.  (The entire series is great, actually.)<br />Although this book is only a sketch, it provides some really helpful information when it comes to issues such as the Pelagian controversy and Augustine's views on Original Sin.  It is interesting to note that although Augustine is held in such high regard by many today, his own ideas were sometimes reviled and considered heretical in his own time.  Of course, it is also worth noting that Augustine's ideas are oftentimes completely misunderstood today; people sometimes force later developments onto Augustine.<br />Due to his continuing controversy - and the man is one of the more controversial orthodox thinkers in the history of the Christian Church - this book is worth reading.  For those interested in further reading, the suggested readings in the back are a great place to start (I myself just picked up Peter Brown's autobiography on Augustine).  For those who have no desire to become scholars on Augustine, however, this &quot;very short introduction&quot; is a very fine introduction as well.  It is a great place to start.	2003-03-20

This book, although old (and, some would argue - perhaps fairly - a bit dated), is an incredible scholarly work on how various mystics within Islam have understood Islam's central claim: \\"There is no God but God, and Muhammad is His Prophet\\".  According to Schimmel, all of Islamic mysticism can be summed up as trying to understand this core doctrine.<br />Unlike some scholars today who pay more attention to differences than continuity, Schimmel's book outlines the many, many currents of Islamic thought without coming to conclusions such as \\"Well, it is really impossible to say what is or is not Islamic mysticism\\".  Instead, she looks at the historical development of mystical Islamic thought, noting both consistencies and deviations, orthodoxy and heterodoxy, the noble and the shameful.  The ability to walk the fine line between excessive praise and excessive criticism of a given religious tradition - in this case Islam - is walked with great care and balance by Schimmel.  She recognizes that the basic goal of the mystics of Islam was to be true witnesses to Islam's central claim but that this was not always achieved.<br />One of the most fascinating streams of mystical Islamic thought is the understanding of the soul.  This topic is discussed many times as Schimmel notes the views of different mystics; for those looking for a way out of the dead end that much of secular psychotherapy has given us, the understanding of people as containing both higher and lower natures - as well as a fundamental need for God - is something that is worth chewing on.  That this view is the same as that held by classical Christianity is worth noting (and Schimmel regularly notes similarities to other religious traditions throughout her work).<br />This book is a thick read - in fact, it is highly detailed and can become a bit confusing at points, especially when Schimmel begins to discuss yet another person by the same name; it will take time to get through.  Nonetheless, it is a highly rewarding read and, for those that seek to understand the religion of Islam better, this book will help to paint *some* of that picture in a more detailed manner.	2003-03-16

St. John of Damascus wrote during the height of the iconoclastic controversy during the 8th century and this little book contains the bulk of his three apologies against those who sought to destroy icons and keep them apart from Church worship.<br />His argument runs like this: If Christ was fully God and fully man, then matter must not be seen as fundamentally evil.  In fact, (and here St. John of Damascus follows St. Athanasius) if Christ took upon our human flesh, then matter has actually been redeemed.  Icons, then, as a pictorial representation of a transcendent reality should be seen in the same light: their being made is not at all heretical and the reverence that is paid to them is a way of worshiping the God they signify, rather than they themselves as created objects.  The theology behind icons is, for St. John of Damascus, fundamentally incarnational.<br />The book is quick, easy reading that will give every preson something to reflect on.  Such a short, simple text is easily accessible to both the scholar (or, if you are like me, the arm-chair theologian) and the worshiper.  For those of you interested in better understanding Christian thought, this is worth having in your library.	2003-02-21

In the earlier part of the 20th century, Jewish historian Gershom Scholem posited that Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism - a mystical movement that arose in Rabbinic Judaism in the 2nd and 3rd centuries - was, in fact, a form of Jewish Gnosticism.  Furthermore, Scholem proposed that this Jewish Gnosticism was also the mysticism that was practiced by the same orthodox rabbis that produced the Mishnah, Talmud, and Midrashim.  Scholem's thesis has been debated ever since, and this is where Deutsch's book comes in to help clarify the relationship between Gnosticism and Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism.<br />Despite some of the basic similarities (such as heavenly ascent) between Gnosticism and Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism, there are also serious differences, such as the way that they understand the Hebrew Bible (Gnosticism denigrated it, while Hekhalot and Merkavah mystics held it in high regard).  Deutsch points out that when Gnostic texts are analyzed and compared to Hekhalot and Merkavah texts, it is only a few of the Gnostic texts that really seem to have parallels to those in the Hekhalot and Merkavah corpus.  And, those texts that do look related may be related because they were influenced by the Hekhalot and Merkavah texts, not the other way around.<br />How, then, are we to understand the relationship between Gnosticism and Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism?  Deutsch proposes that the best way to study these texts is to look at them from a comparative standpoint of how each group approached the sacred.  It is only then that the similarities and differences will be revealed to a greater extent because, as Deutsch puts it, \\"only a framework can be constructed on the foundation of the available evidence.\\" (p. 150)<br />Once someone reads a book like Joseph Dan's _The Ancient Jewish Mysticism_, I would recommend a book like this, which provides a detailed analysis of some of the debates within the field of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism.  Deutsch pays attention to detail and argues his points persuasively.  In the end, the evidence for Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism being Jewish Gnosticism looks weak.  But, although there was probably no unified Rabbinic Gnosticism, there probably were some Gnostic rabbis who helped to shape the movement that produced the Hekhalot and Merkavah mystical texts.tail and argues his points persuasively.

(A rough outline: Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism is a religious movement that took place within the world of Rabbinic Judaism beginning somewhere in the 2nd or 3rd century.  Its main focus is the ascent of a rabbi to the highest heaven so that he can worship God with the angels and perhaps even see God, which in some sources gives him a certain power to affect change here on earth.)<br />This book focuses on the relationship between Judaism, Mandaeism, and Gnosticism as a way of painting a more detailed picture of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism.  Deutsch uses a \\"comparative approach\\" to studying the texts produced by these different groups; the result is that Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism looks quite syncretistic.  Such an approach certainly gives insight, but it also causes a bit of confusion about the nature of Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism.<br />Firstly, the benefits of using such an approach is that it paints a picture with wide brush strokes: the reader is likely to get good idea of major religious trends within the world of antiquity.  Deutsch has three appendices that deal with Islam, Christianity, and Hermeticism that further illustrate what seems to be a general religious idea - that there are mediators between God and humanity that are above man but nonetheless divine.  (Anyone familiar with the Christological controversies in the early centuries of Christianity will find much here that parallels those debates.)<br />These broad strokes also imply that there was a large amount of syncretism between different religious groups, with ideas from completely different religions permeating each other.  Certainly, any historian of religion would agree that this is, indeed, the case: religions do influence each other.  The question of \\"how much do religions influence each other?\\" is where much of the debate comes in.<br />This, then, is the downside to Deutsch's approach.  Although in the last chapter he surveys much of the prior research on Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism and notes that the authors of its texts were quite familiar with Rabbinic law and lore, it still seems like Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism were quite syncretistic.  Some influence is certainly possible and even likely, but isn't it also possible - and perhaps far more plausible - that despite these influences, Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism arose out of streams that were already developed within Judaism such as apocalypticism?  Indeed it is, and although Deutsch mentions these, it still seems that in the Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism owes less to its own religious heritage than it does to other dualistic religions.<br />This book should be read with other works about Hekhalot and Merkavah mysticism in order for the reader to better understand Deutsch's contribution to the field.  Think of this book as being like a chapter: it reads well when read with all the other chapters in a book.  Otherwise, it is likely to make little sense.	2003-01-23

It contains a number of illustrations: icons, photographs (black and white), and manuscript artwork.  The basic thesis is that Eastern Othorodox spirituality - what some would call &quot;mysticism&quot; - begins with primitive monasticism and culminates with Palamas in the 14th century (although there are a few slight developments in Russia, such as St. Seraphim of Sarov).  The basic practice that culminates with Palamas has come to be known as &quot;Hesychasm&quot;, which means &quot;inner stillness&quot; or &quot;inner peace&quot;.<br />Meyendorff's writing is easy to read and comprehend; it is nice that he pretty much gets to the heart of each thinker he discusses (Evagrius, the pseudo-Macarian homilies, St. Gregory of Nyssa, St. Maximus the Confessor, and others) rather than discussing superfluous detail (the point of the book, afterall, is the *spirituality* of the Eastern Orthodox church).  The bigger picture of doctrines like true prayer and deification/theosis (union with God, a concept largely abandoned in the West) are touched upon along with their developments in the thoughts of the above thinkers.  It is a wonderful touch that Meyendorff includes a fair number of quotes from the primary sources.<br />The focus of the book is St. Gregory Palamas and Meyendorff offers a good synopsis of his life and times before going into the controversy surrounding Palamas and a monk named Barlaam.  In short, Palamas' great victory was teaching that because God has become human, humans can experience God in a living way (this recalls the teachings of St. Athanasius who, oddly enough, is not touched upon in this book).  It is interesting to note that although this book is almost 45 years old, Meyendorff touches upon the tolerance of the Turkish Muslims that captured a ship Palamas was on and the dialoguethat went on between the Muslims and Hesychasts in the 14th century.<br />The book is clearly biased in Palamas' favor, and Meyendorff does seem to have the motive of showing how the traditions of the Eastern Orthodox church have remained faithful to their original heritage, a common claim made by Eastern Orthodox thinkers and writers as a way of distinguishing them from what they perceive to be distortions in the West.  (I, for one, am staying out of the debate.)  Although Meyendorff's bias isn't too terrible of a thing, the reader should know this going into the book; those that read carefully will probably pick this up pretty quickly.<br />The book seriously suffers, however, from the absence of any type of bibliography (which is always nice to have, so that the reader can do some of his or her own research).  Although the book is an introduction, topics are often touched upon so lightly that the reader wants more.  It's hard to get more without a bibliography!  The book also suffers from its print and binding jobs, which are rather poor.<br />It would be great if someone would take this book and look up the original sources that Meyendorff used and repackage it without typos and with a better binding.  The material itself is great - and for this I recommend the book - but for more serious students it is of limited use.	2002-11-16

Even though the child has hardly learned to speak, his father takes pleasure in listening to his words.&quot; (p. 102)<br />There is something both bold and humbling about and such a perspective on prayer.  God is not only King, but Father as well.  The Infinite One is both large and small, far and near.<br />Many of the different dynamics of prayer are explored in this work, each in its own section, and everything is referenced at the end of the book.  The book opens with an academic essay that provides a good context for the Hasidic exploration of the vast sea of prayer, the experience of union with the Divine Presence (p. 80).  As with most readers, any background knowledge of Hasidism is helpful, but at the same time not necessary to have in order to be touched by the wisdom of these mystics.<br />I think, though, that this book needs to be approached as an open door to the myster of prayer.  Rather than just being read, it should be tested: to approach God as a child who is unable to speak is a humbling thing.  To persist, nonetheless, and draw close to God as God draws us and pulls us close is to experience God's love.  The reader of this book will have some far reaching light as s/he travels and progresses down the path of such prayer.	2002-11-16
US	50993506	R2BYL3A78QR5EJ	0809122952	754281872	Athanasius : The Life of Antony and the Letter To Marcellinus	Books	5	39	40	N	N	Inspiring	Although the preface is a bit lacking, the two works by St. Athanasius translated here are worth not only reading, but contemplating and wrestling with as well.<br />The first work, The Life of Antony, is a work about the father of Christian asceticism, St. Antony of Egypt.  It contains both narrative and doctrinal content; the doctrinal content is presented in the forms of discourses by Antony, usually to groups of monks.  He teaches much on demons and the discernment of spirits, the fate of souls after death, the importance of staying within the Church and staying away from schismatics and heretics.  The discourses are, at a few points, a bit polemical - like many works from the early Church - but not excessively overbearing.<br />The uniqueness of the story is not just in Antony's doctrinal discourses, though.  The narrative teaches things all its own.  One of these things is that by separating one's self from the world the holy person becomes so much more indespensible to the world.  Although Antony lived as a monk separate from the world, he was never separated from the world; in geographically and spiritually separating himself from the world, Antony became that much more involved in his world.  He taught, healed, exorcised demons and engaged in debates with philosophers, all of this because of his reputation as a holy man.<br />From this follows something else taught by the narrative: the pursuit of God truly transforms one and causes one to become a conduit for God's healing and redemption of the world.  Antony received visions and words of knowledge about people and things about to occur and more people were converted to the Christian faith.  The work of Antony, as the book repeatedly emphasizes, is the work of God.<br />The second work contained in this volume, The Letter to Marcellinus, is a delightful exposition on praying the Psalms of David.  St. Athanasius writes that regardless of one's experience, the Psalms provide words to express where one is at- whether in sorrow and despair or in joy.  He also shows (through some rather creative interpretation) that the whole of Scripture is contained within the Psalter.  <br />It would have been nice if a translation of Psalm 151 (found only in the Greek Bible, which is what Athanasius used) had been included, as Athanasius references it in his Letter to Marcellinus.  The work is found in the New Oxford Annoted Apocrypha: New Revised Standard Version, though, so if you don't have one, buy one (isbn: 0195288009)!<br />All in all, both works are absolutely charming.	2002-11-15

The book will only take about one hour to read, as it contains quite a few pictures and the print is large while the pages are small.<br />Dr. Charlesworth surveys the scholarly work done on NTAP both old and new and recommends what books one should check out if one wishes to study this subject.  He talks about the importance of NTAP for understanding the New Testament and earliest Christianity, as well as how these works have been used throughout the ages.  He also grants that some of the NTAP probably contain things that are historically accurate.<br />The book reads something like a short introductory lecture to the topic; in fact, the bulk of this book is actually composed of some lectures he gave.  Again, I think [X] is bit much but in the end, I think this book may also be the best place to start.  The work on NTAP has been growing over the past few years, and this book serves as a good beginner's guide to the subject.	2002-11-15

(I really do give kudos to whomever thought up this series of Very Short Introductions).<br />Post-Structuralism looks at how language and words create our world.  Rather than being a unified theory, however, post-structuralism consists of many different theories proposed by many different thinkers.  All of these thinkers and their theories are gathered, for better or for worse, under the category &quot;post-structuralism&quot;.  Notable theorists are Saussure, Barthes, Lacan and Foucault (these names pop up a lot in all the various post- theories: post-structuralism, post-modernism, post-colonialism, etc.).<br />Belsey traces the development of literary theory up to the present and discusses various thinkers strengths and weaknesses.  She also distinguishes it from Deconstruction (founded by Jacques Derrida), which is related but not the same.  She includes a selection of works that she recommends people read for further understanding of the object.<br />Like all of the other Very Short Introductions that I have read, this one is well written, detailed and - as the title indicates - short.  Whether you are the busy person who doesn't have the time to dip into more detailed introductions or the person with just some idle curiosity and a few bucks to spend, this is a great introduction.	2002-11-15

Although many would say &quot;well, we aren't missing much by not having these works,&quot; I heartily disagree. 2 Esdras, in particular, is a very moving work written somewhere around 100 c.e. that contains a dialogue between Ezra (or, more likely, someone writing in Ezra's name) and the angel Uriel. The book deals with theodicy in a truly human way - the frailty and the hope both shine through. The books of the Maccabees also contain things not found in Protestant Bibles, notably the encouragement that praying for the dead is a righteous deed and the story of Hannukah (which was, by the way, celebrated by Jesus in the Gospel of John).<br />There is an introduction to each book, as well as notes at the bottom of each page to help the reader understand the original context, as well as cross reference the ideas found within a specific text with those ideas found in other Biblical texts.<br />This book is an invaluable edition to every person's library - whether professional or layman.	2002-11-15

The subtitle of the book, &quot;The Messiahs of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Other Ancient Literature&quot; is important because Collins does not restrict his study to the Dead Sea Scrolls.  He goes through the Pseudepigrapha (a large, open-ended collection of biblically-related and biblically-dependant literature that is not a part of the Bible), the Apocrypha, the Hebrew Bible/Tanak/Old Testament and the messianic ideas contained within those works.  Collins also deals with Jesus and the New Testament in this work, although it is on the side that these discussions take place.<br />Collins' knowledge of the Hebrew Bible is extensive on both theological and historical levels.  His knowledge is also useful because in the Hebrew Bible are the roots of the problems with messianic interpretation - the scriptures themselves.  Once Collins places particular scriptures in their historical context, he then goes on to show their influence(s) and interpretation(s) in various post- and extra-biblical works of literature.  We find a pre-existent, heavenly messiah, a priestly messiah, a kingly messiah, and a militant messiah in the works Collins analyzes.  At least one messiah was expected and possibly and two, depending on who wrote the work.  Collins also deals with the history of the word &quot;messiah&quot; and its various uses in the Hebrew Bible.<br />In reading the book, the reader will gain some insights as to how and why the writers of the New Testament understood Jesus the way that they did, but the goal of the book is not to connect these works to Jesus.  The book is, in many ways, a survey of the messianic thought during and before Jesus' time.<br />This book is not an introduction by any means.  It is an in-depth study; some previous knowledge of the Scrolls, the Pseudepigrapha, and Second Temple history will be useful to the reader.  A glossary would have been nice and helpful and would have opened the doors for less knowledgeable readers to read and understand the book.  Overall, this is an excellect read.  However, previous knowledge will enable - and perhaps even be necessary - for reader to grasp the many insights in Collins' work.	2000-12-28

We find both similarities and differences between Jesus and the Pharisees/Rabbinic literature, Jesus and the Essenes/Dead Sea Scrolls, and Jesus and the Hebrew Scriptures.  This serves to create a Jesus that is believable and makes sense within the history of his people; in this book, Jesus feels authentic.  I also find Vermes' Jesus to be one that is highly inspiring, being interested, ultimately, in what Vermes refers to as &quot;the essence of true religion...the existential relationship between man and man and man and God.&quot;<br />Vermes deals with a number of topics in this book - Jesus as Messiah, Jesus as Lord, Jesus the Son of God, and Judaism in Jesus' time.  Vermes find similarities between Jesus and the ancient, charismatic Hasidim such as Honi the Circle Drawer and Hanina ben Dosa.  Jesus should be viewed as a son of God (which is a term that implies intimacy), devout in his observance of the Torah, but also unconcerned with smaller aspects of the law at the expense of the larger aspects (like the other Hasidim).<br />Vermes also enlightens the reader to the incredibly complexity of the Judaisms of Jesus' time without confusing the reader or bogging him/her down in needless, minute detail.<br />Ultimately, this is the most rewarding book I have ever read on Jesus.  It is enlightening, informative, and paints an authentic, inspiring picture of Jesus the charismatic Hasid.	2000-12-27
US	50993506	R1Q3T67N05YFGG	9650506780	317617614	The Ancient Jewish Mysticism	Books	4	5	5	N	N	great book, awful print job	This book is a great introduction to the early Jewish mystical traditions found in various forms of literature written between the 3rd and 7th centuries, particularly in the Hekhalot and Merkavah tractates.  Dan is from the Gershom Scholem school of thought and therefore he does a lot of textual - followed by historical - analysis.  He also does a nice bit of comparative study between Christian and Gnostic thought whenever there are similarities.  Dan also analyzes several major themes among these works, such as Messianism.<br />The mystical literature of this era ranges from the pseudo-biblical apocalypse (such as the Book of Zerubabbel), to the magical (parts of Hekhalot writings), to short treatises whose purpose is not yet entirely known, despite their vast influence (Sefer Yetzirah, Shi'ur Qomah).  Several of these writings are really heretical/heterodox when compared to the Talmud, and Dan makes note of this.<br />It is interesting to note that Dan views Sefer Yetzirah as being primarily a philosophical text that was supposed to fill in the gaps in the biblical account of creation, NOT as a magical or meditative text.<br />As great as the content of this book may be, however, this is absolutely the worst print job i have ever seen in any book in my whole entire life.  Each page looks like it was copied on bad, bad copy machine.  Perhaps in the future they can correct this.<br />Nonetheless, I still recommend this book to those interested in the history and development of Jewish mysticism, as well as its later manifestations in the medieval Kabbalah.	2000-11-28

Each of Jesus' parables is put against the backdrop of similar parables told by different Rabbis in the Talmud and other Rabbinic writings. It's interesting to see the overlap between the two which is, at points, quite substantial.<br />Young is quite adamant in his view that Jesus must be dropped back into the world of second temple Judaism. While context does create meaning, the main fault that I have with Young's approach is that by using the Rabbinic writings as the main source of comparison, whole bodies of Jewish literature are overlooked (he does bring the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Pseudepigrapha in at points, but the bulk of the book deals with Jesus and the Rabbis). So, while there are strengths to this approach, there are also weaknesses; Rabbinic Judaism is hardly representative of the Judaisms of Jesus' day. Furthermore, Jesus wasn't a rabbi like Hillel or Akiba, so the usefulness of comparisons primarily between the Gospels and Rabbinics is further diminished.<br />Dr. Young also seems quite interested in debunking the allegorical interpretations of the parables of Jesus as taught by early church fathers such as Origen. While this may help to clear up the meanings of the prables from a historical perspective, is it really necessary to do so? One can teach accurate history without debunking the views of others. The result ends up being that Young comes across as rather argumentative and standoff-ish and overall it is just plain annoying to read.<br />I would recommend Young's book to anyone interested in a comparison between Jesus' parables and those of the Rabbis - in this area, Young hits the bull's eye. However, as a book about Jesus' parables where the goal is less to contrast and compare than to enlightend and educate, Young hits a little too left of center.	2000-11-24

What Dr. Charlesworth shows is that yes, there are a number of parallels between the Pseudepigrapha and the New Testament.  But, what I was hoping to find in this book was a more thorough analysis of what these parallels might mean for the New Testament.  If the authors really were aware of these extra-canonical texts (assuming that they really were extra-canonical) and were actually influenced by them, then do any of the NT writings take on new meaning?  Do they take on different meanings?  How could they enhance one's understanding of a particular text?  Or, can they shed any light on the New Testament at all?<br />Again, this book is a great introduction to the Pseudepigrapha.  But, it only begins to shed light on their relationship(s) to the New Testament and leaves the reader hoping that some time soon, someone will come along and dispell much of the remaining darkness.	2000-11-08

The reason I recommend it over Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (by Gershom Scholem, arguably the most important and influential scholar in this area) is because this book gets the reader directly in touch with the texts (and, thanks to the commentary, the meanings derived from them) that make up what has come to be known as &quot;Kabbalah.&quot;<br />Matt divides his book into sections by topic and each entry contains an excerpt from a text that fits the particular topic.  The introduction contains a brief essay on the development of the Kabbalah; in the back of the book is a commentary on each passage, helping the reader to understand aspects, meanings, and references in the texts that otherwise may have not been understood.<br />Highly enriching.	2000-11-08

These three  are the three that I believe are the most important and prevalent in the  work.<br />Topic 1: American Spirituality<br />Can one possibly be a religious -  or even &quot;spiritual&quot; - person in turn of the century/end of the  millenium America?  If so, how is this done?  Gallagher visits a number of  &quot;millenial&quot; houses of worship and discusses through her own  insights and conversations with those attendees, how one may actually make  this work.<br />Topic 2: Baby Boomer Spirituality (Or, American Spirituality  II)<br />Gallagher, a baby boomer, is at many points in this book wrestling  with her own previously held notions about spirituality and life - it makes  me think, in many ways, of a sort of mid-life spiritual crisis.  Is it  possibly to be a child of the sixties, yet believe in the usefulness of  science, and the reality of God?  For the baby boomer generation, how will  their own spirituality going to be sought after and found?  Again,  Gallagher turns to those who seem to make it work to find answers to these  questions.<br />Topic 3: Millenial Religion<br />Perhaps one the biggest theme in  the book yet, in the end, I feel that it may also be the least discussed  and least well-defined.  Sure, one can throw around the term  &quot;millenial religion,&quot; but that doesn't mean one understands it.   Yet, who does understand history when it is in the making?  Gallagher turns  to the world-renowned Huston Smith to discover some of the issues  (possibly) confronting religion at the turn of the century/millenium, as  well as several other experts on point.  <br />It would have been nice if this  book had been more documented with footnotes, so that the reader could look  up some of the sources that are quoted.  There are a number of books listed  in the footnotes section that will certainly make for interesting reading,  though.<br />I do not know what Gallagher's purpose in writing this book was.   She does not seem to hold any dogmatic agenda whatsoever, and if anything,  the book seems to be more of a portrait of current American Spirituality  than anything else.  I think that it may actually be good that Gallagher  does not - or, is not able to - answer the above questions, though, since  at this point in the game, discussing millenial religion will be a topic  for the history books of the future, not one for believing, dis-believing,  or non-believing writers today.  Her work is a good insight, though, into  the current trends in the religious attitudes of Americans, and is better  company on a rainy day than a number of other contemporary religious works.	2000-09-16

Although as an ethnography it does  dig into the movement - and rather deeply, too - it also takes a  comparative standpoint and seeks to illuminate the reader about the  similarities between Messianic and other popular forms of Judaism.  The  main question that she seeks to answer is, &quot;What does Messianic  Judaism say about mainstream Judaism?&quot;  On a deeper and more basic  level is the question of Jewish identity, a la &quot;What makes someone a  Jew?&quot;  Harris-Shaprio does an excellent job detailing the history and  main tenents of Messianic Judaism, as well as the experiences of several of  its followers.  The only complaint that i really have with this book is  that the author doesn't seem to be able to decide whether or not her goal  is to a) provide a sort of diary of her experiences while studying the  group; or b) provide the reader with a factual, dissertation-like  evaluation of the movement and its ramifications and implications for  Judaism.  The first half of the book seems to be more of the former, while  the second half is more of the latter.  It actually would have been nice if  there had been some statistics in the book, such as the number of  adherents, % male/female, and % jew/gentile.  It also would have been  interesting to know the # of converts to Messianic Judaism from one of  mainstream Judaism's five branches (Hasidic, Orthodox, Conservative,  Reform, or Reconstructionist).  After reading the Preface, it seems that  she is still following the &quot;movement&quot; (which actually appears to  be rather diversified) and if this is true, I hope that Harris-Shapiro  writes and releases more books on either the movement or facets of the  movement in the future.  This book is well thought out and will cause one  to question both popular notions of identity (particularly the religious  and cultural aspects of it), and the creation of religious movements,  noting the no religious movement is really &quot;pure&quot; in its  formation.  Highly recommended, for both those interested the study of  religion (especially from a comparative standpoint), as well as those  interested in the psychological and sociological developments and aspects  of a small group that is on the outside of the mainstream, yet desires to  be accepted into and by it.	2000-09-05

However, an introduction is all one gets.  Although it is important to study Paul in the light of his Jewish heritage - he did study &quot;at the  feet of&quot; Rabban Gamaliel and was a &quot;Pharisee of Pharisees&quot; -  it seems to me that this book really glosses over a lot of important  issues.  I agree with Young's point that Paul's basic point was that  Gentiles did not have to convert to Judaism to know God.  However, what are  the ramifications and implications of this for Jews and Judaism?  It seems  that this book only begins to put Paul into a Jewish context and, after  having gone through the historical and theological background of Paul, Dr.  Young merely...stops.<br />It also would have been nice if Dr. Young had at  least attempted to reconcile the gospel as presented by Jesus (&quot;the  Kingdom of God is near&quot;) with the gospel as presented by Paul  (&quot;for we preach Christ crucified&quot;).  Each seems far from the  other and instead of even approaching the topic it is left alone as if it  doesn't even exist.<br />This book is a fair introduction and if one is  looking for a mere introduction into the Jewish side of Paul's thought,  then this book is highly recommended.  However, for those who are looking  for an in-depth study that gets into the nitty gritty of Paul and his  thought, I would recommend that one either stays away or instead buys this  book and supplements it with others.	2000-07-16

However, I would like to attempt to clarify a few of the supposed contradictions between I Enoch and the Bible.<br />As far as 2 Peter 2 goes, the context of the passage on angels (v. 11) is that angels do not blashpheme God in the same way that humans do (see the Peshitta translation of the Bible by George M. Lamsa - it is a bit clearer).<br />When it comes to Jude and his epistle, the idea of his quoting Enoch sarcastically is absolutely assinine - just read the Epistle of Jude.<br />Timothy names Jesus as the supreme intercessor between God and man. In a more general sense of the word, however, there were many people who acted as intercessors between the people of Israel and God (such as Moses, the greatest of all the prophets next to Jesus!).<br />Finally, Jesus said that in Heaven - or rather, in the world to come - people would not marry each other. However, according to I Enoch, the angels had sex with humans, which did not necessarily involve being married to them.<br />Concerning the \\"mythical\\" aspects of Enoch, they are no more \\"far fetched\\" than anything in Scripture.<br />I Enoch is absolutely fascinating. Enoch is assumed up into Heaven, travels through the Heavens, is told secrets of the coming judgment and the messianic age, sees the workings of Heaven, and pronounces judgements upon the wicked angels.<br />Although I do recommend that one reads this book since it does, according to Jude, contain prophecy, I recommend it most of all for the sake of improving one's education. Whether or not you believe that it should be in the Bible, it is an important piece of literature and even if it isn't accepted as Scripture by most people, that doesn't mean that it is any less important or worthy of one's time or attention.<br />As far as this translation goes, it is a bit outdated (which is why I only gave it 4 stars). If you can afford it, buy:<br />Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Vol. 1: Apocalyptic Literature and Testaments.<br />Otherwise, this or the R. H. Charles version will suffice.	2000-06-19

Buber then  proceeds to relate 20 stories/legends about the Baal-Shem's life and  teaching, followed by a glossary of the key terms in the book.<br />The  wonderful thing about this book is its beautiful, poetic simplicity.  The  language is poetic, and the stories are profound because they show that in  the middle of the 1700's, God became a vibrant, living reality to a group  of common folk in eastern Europe.  &quot;God desires the heart,&quot;  taught the Baal-Shem.<br />On a personal note, this book opened my eyes to a  side of both life and God that I have never seen before.  Live life with  joy and humility, live it deeply and with passion.  God rejoices and dances  with us in our joy.<br />&quot;God desires the heart.&quot;  How simple, yet  how utterly profound.	2000-05-05

The insights to I Enoch and Jubilees, along with 4 Ezra and various books of the Apocrypha were particularly enlightening.  <br />It is  interesting to note the possible (dis)connection between the Apostle Paul  and his theory of sin entering the world through one man and the teaching  in the book of Sirach that sin enters the world through the woman.  Perhaps  both are true?  Or, perhaps, Paul was trying to address an issue that he  felt was untrue?<br />This is one of the books that puts early Christianity in  its context more than many of the others because works such as Sirach are,  in this book, evaluated as being just as important and relevant as the  &quot;canon&quot; of Scripture itself.<br />For those interested in early  Christianity, early Judaism, the &quot;canon&quot; of the Bible, and the  writings of the New Testament in the context they were written in, this is  an essential piece of literature to have.	2000-04-29
