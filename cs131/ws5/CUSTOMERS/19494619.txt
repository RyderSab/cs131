Now before I write this review on my perception, I would like to let everyone know that I will not give up any good parts or tell the whole story like some of the members do, only because it's wrong to those who haven't read it yet. Although \\"Triple Crown Productions\\" always seems to put out nothing but Gangster, -Shot'em up-bang bang-Thug-love -tragedies. This book had something every other book didn't and that was a spiritual message and I thought that was very brilliant of the author to do. What I don't like is that Triple Crown has all of these wonderful writers yet they make them look so bad with all of the terrible editing.<BR> Mona wasn't that baddest B**** I seen and observe better on the streets and in other books, her age seem to over power her as a character and I thought that was one of her most major flaws. My girl Yarnise from \\"A Hustler's Wife\\" seemed more gangster then any other character in all the books I read. But I guess all can't be the same. But Cam took 3rd the title of grimiest of the year. Black (from \\"B-More Careful\\" has 2nd) And Benggi (form \\"A Hustlers Wife\\" took 1st) and Lucky Luck (from \\"A Project Chick\\") took 4th.<BR> I didn't like the fact about the videotapes I thought that was the most evil things to do. But with that the book definitely caught my attention. I hope when I start \\"Grimmy\\" it will put me on a edge and have me in tears or just in a state of amazement. read it you like it. Much RESPECT TO MS. Kashamba Williams	2004-05-20

Trying to keep one away from a good friend is a tough and hard one to follow, Faith is a very cruel character who in my opinion shouldn't have got a second chance from Jayson.
