Phil shows in this book that there's more to winning a championship than just having the best team. Phil goes into the many difficulties he had in dealing with the huge egos of Kobe and Shaq, and the frustrations he had in trying to teach the triangle offence to Gary and Karl. They had to learn it in a few months and Phil says it takes a couple of years to really learn it. Phil talks of Garys frustrations with his system, and you can see in this book that Phil is far from being overated having to handle all those egos, and figure out how to beat the other talented NBA teams as well, he also talks about his relationship with Jeannie Buss, his Girl friend as well as his employer. I really enjoyed this book it was informative and entertaining.	2005-01-23

St.Catherine was one of the most amazing saints the church has ever had. She was a very humble person yet she had great influence on many of the politcal and church leaders of her day. The book starts off with her struggle with her mother who was very stubborn. She wanted Catherine to marry, but Catherine wanted to dedicate her life to God. In the book you read about the many people Catherine led to Christ, many of them were very hard hearted, and her influence on the pope convincing him to come back to Rome. Catherine lived in a very difficult time, there were many wars going on, the church was very divided, and it was also the time of the plague, but through it all Catherine was a shinning light who inspired others. I think anyone interested in the lives of the saints will love this book. I'm looking forward to reading more books by this author.	2004-07-17

I think all baseball fans will enjoy it, but it will appeal especially to Dodger fans. I've been a Dodger fan all my life, and this book brought back a lot of memories some good and some not so great. I must admit that I remembered Fred mostly for his trading away Pedro Martinez and John Wettland,but this book reminded me of all the good decisions he made such as putting together the team that won the championship in 1988, getting Mickey Hatcher,Alfredo Griffin,John Shelby Kirk Gibson and others. He talks of his early years as a writer then goes into how he started with the Dodgers, and his years as General Manager, then goes into Fox buying the team. I learned alot about Fred Claire and others in the organization this book was a very easy and enjoyable read and made me realize how much class Fred has and how he really seemed to care about those who worked for him, and for the Dodger organization.	2004-07-03

His books are always intelligent and thought provoking. This book discusses many issues some of them are; moral absolutes, religion &amp; morality, values, and how to know Gods will .I like the way he sums up his thoughts, and offers helpful ideas, in one chapter he has 12 boxes that morality won't fit in, in another he writes of the most critical issues of our time, he also talks of simplicity and the loss of the sacred in our culture. The 7 principles for knowing Gods will and the 7 power aids of the Holy Spirit were very useful. This is a book I would recommend to anyone wanting to understand how to think more clearly in these times of moral relativism.	2004-06-20

This whole series has helped me have a better understanding and a greater love for Gods word.	2004-03-25

This  book starts off by talking of the three types of families, then talks about how the family resembles the trinity.

The book goes on to talk about the covenants God has made with his people, and the New covenant Jesus made through the church, then it talks about the love of God and living a more Godly life. The last part of the book talks about the similarities of the family and the church. This is another excellent book by Scott Hahn and has given me a deeper understanding of God.	2004-03-01

She has so much insight to offer us. This book compares the soul to a castle with different rooms, which she calls mansions. Each mansion is a different stage of the soul on it's journey toward God. St. Theresa talks about seven mansions. As the soul passes from one mansion to the next the soul progresses toward God more completely. Theresa explains in each stage what is lacking and what we can to do to reach the next stage. I feel this book offers many valuable insights to help us on our journey toward God.	2004-02-25

Even though this book was written almost fourhundred years ago the topics discussed here are as applicable today as they were then. Francis wrote these collections of spiritual instructions to teach as many people as possible to lead a devout life. The book talks of sin and how it affects our relationship with God, and then goes into the necessity of prayer and gives practical advice on how to pray. Some other topics covered are the necessity of living the virtues such as purity, humility and courage. This book will help you learn how to be more focused on God in the midst of every day life which sometimes can make it hard to stay focused on the most important thing.	2004-01-04

David comes from a fundamentalist backround, he used to believe in the rapture and is very charitable towards others who still believe in it. In this book he has done a phenominal amount of research, he goes into the many areas of the bible dealing with the end times, prophecy, and the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. The book talks about nine ground rules of interpreting prophecy then talks of the prophecies of Daniel, the olivet discource in Matt:24,and in Luke and Mark then talks of the The different verses in Pauls epistles and goes through the book of revelation. In the appendixes there are many quotes from the church fathers also. This book is very well written and I recommend it to any catholic wanting to understand why the church doesn't teach the rapture and what it teaches of the end times.	2003-12-25

His teaching is always very clear and intelligent, yet he is easy to understand.In this  talk he explains why the resurrection is essential to the christian faith, and how many people deny it today even many religious leaders. He then talks about the historical facts that lead us to believe in the resurrection. In the last tape he talks about what the resurrection means to us in practical everyday life. I have learned alot from Ken and I believe anyone who listens to these tapes will benefit from it.	2003-11-24

The story starts off fast and doesn't slow down. It is a story about a very rich man, Troy Phelan, who has built a company that is worth 11 billion dollars, but in the process he has alienated everyone of his family and friends. Troy commits suicide but just before he does he changes his will and leaves all his money to a daughter named Rachel no one knew he had. The daughter is a missionary in Brazil and the lawyer sent to find her, Nate, is going through struggles with alcohol,the IRS, and family problems. Nates adventures in Brazil are exciting, and his meeting with rachel helps turn his life around. You see on the one hand rachels love of God and detachment for material things and on the other hand the greed and self centeredness of troys children. The courtroom drama is also very good. This is a well written and thought provoking book.	2003-11-02

I've gotten alot out of every book of his I've read. This book tells the story of Gods covenant relationship with his people. You see how over and over God is faithful, but we keep falling away. The book starts with Genesis and Gods covenant with Adam then, Noah, Abraham,Moses,David, and finally Jesus. The last 40 pages or so talks about how Jesus fulfills the covenant. It is my favorite part of the book it goes in depth about the church being the bride of Christ and the eucharist being a renewal of the covanant. This book gave me a deeper understanding of Gods love and mercy and how God has continued to love us even when we fail.	2003-10-05

It has many notes including some from the church fathers, some historical, some theological, word studies and more. My only complaint,and it's a small one, is that the bible verses are not in the book. You have to read your bible then look up the comments, but thats not a big deal. This is a valuable resource for any catholic, and in my opinion probably the best catholic bible study out there. Stephen Ray has really done a great service for the ordinary catholic who wants to know the bible better.	2003-07-14

The last part of the book is my favorite it talks about his first season with the Lakers, the problems they had learning the triangle, and the conflicts between Kobe &amp; Shaq. Charley also has a nice interview with Tex in one of the chapters. The book goes more into Phils time with the Lakers than the Bulls, but all basketball fans should enjoy this book.

This is a powerful &amp; well written book once I started reading it I didn't want to put the book down. These people showed how adoration has given them a stronger faith and a deeper love of Jesus.

This book has inspired me to spend time every day in adoration. I recommend this book to anyone interested in a deeper prayer life.	2003-05-26
