This book helped to answer most of them.  It is well written, in an almost conversational style. Easy reading, but not lightweight.<br />This book will help to answer your questions about The DaVinci Code, but could also be read to help someone learn about some aspects of the early church. I found the information about Constantine to be really interesting as well as the explanation of how the bible came to be and what the gnostic gospels are all about.  I highly recommend this book.	2004-04-24

I gave this book 3 stars only because I know that it does provide something for those people who are like Jenny's family in the book.  I have friends for whom this book really meant something.<br />But if I judged it on artistic merit or writing style I'd give it a 1.<br />If I judged it on it's interpretation of \\"the rest of the world\\" (meaning those who believe in a god) I'd give it a zero.<br />It's well intentioned, but the author really has no idea about what Christianity (or other religions) is *really* all about.<br />Yes, the author is correct that there are some believers who do believe that there is \\"a father who...looks down on them to make sure they behave themselves\\" and that they do good deeds because \\"...they are afraid that their god will punish them if they don't do what he says.\\"  But if the author thinks that this is what the religions actually teach, she is mistaken.<br />I just had to laugh while reading this book. THe misconceptions about believers are just hopeless.<br />I think that the sequel to this book should be called \\"Therapy for Jenny\\" because she is so conflicted in this book and wants to believe in something so badly. I have known adults who were once children like Jenny. In the character of Jenny, I see a girl who is not envious of her friends because of their pretty lights and shiny wrapped presents. I see someone who is envious because her own life seems so superficial.<br />Jenny does get a \\"solstice tree\\". Apparantly, it's ok to create a holiday based on belief in a god as long it's not a Judeo-Christian god. \\"...people living long ago who thought of the Sun as a god and made offerings to it to return and make the days longer so they could plant their crops. 'They really needed a festival of light,' Jenny thought to herself.\\"<br />Jenny gets a solstice tree and decorates it with little signs that say, \\"we believe in education\\" and \\"we believe in helping people\\".<br />Hey, Jenny.  Believers belive in that too.<br />Merry Christmas	2004-02-20

I bought this book several a couple of months ago but just really delved into it more deeply this week.  I used it in preparing a talk about the mass for our RCIA group. I have many books on the mass but this one was the most help. The catechumens and candidates and even some of the sponsors got interested in it after seeing me refer to it a few times in my talk.  Several of them asked me to order copies for them.<br />One of the nice features of this book is the content on &quot;how&quot; to go to mass. The author tells us what happens in the mass and why, but also explains how to get more out of the mass every time.<br />Great book. You won't be sorry for buying it.	2003-08-03

Joey explains hunting to STormy and tells him that he won't hunt Stormy. They'll be friends and he will hunt the other deer.<br />So... the boy meets a talking deer and becomes best friends with it and he still hunts.  Because it is for the good of the herd. He will be helping the deer because if he doesn't kill them there will be too many deer and  some will get sick and die.<br />Good reason to hunt, but not in this story. The deer talks to him and he still wants to hunt deer!!!!!<br />Very bizzare.	2003-06-03

This book isn't really about an Italian-American girl rejecting her ethnic family for a more standard, Anglo-Saxon life. This book could have been about a girl of any ethnicity.  It's about a girl rejecting family in her passage to womanhood.<br />Ask any girl, Italian-American or not, if they were ever embarrassed by her mother in the grocery store.  As I was reading the first chapter, I never imagined that the girl's mother was really as embarrassing or odd as she portrayed her to be.  We are seeing the mother through her daughter's eyes. The craziness, the quaintness, the ethnicity is magnified by the eyes of an awkward adolescent.<br />Ignore the reviewers who want this book to be the definitive picture of the life of an Italian American family. That's not what this is about. To expect that is unfair to this book.<br />If the author lived this life, then this is her honest expression about it. We don't have to know the history of the parents or their Italian heritage to understand this book. We have to know how it feels to move from being a member of a family to being an individual adult person.	2003-04-25

Of course, as a couple of the other comments pointed out, this book is not an in-depth presentation of life in a trappist monastery. But it is not pretending to be such a thing. This book gives a nice taste of life in the monastery for a monk and for a retreatant. You get just enough of the taste of the history of this monastery to whet your appetite for more.<br />If you're interested in more, the author has a large, photo-illustrated history of Gethsemani. There are other books on trappist monasteries as well.  If you've ever been to Gethsemani and had the pleasure to hear Fr. Matthew's evening talks, you'll want to look for some of the books of his writings. Matthew Kelty is his name.<br />Also, I have read another book in this same series (A Week Inside) on a Buddhist Monastery. Very very interesting. As with Making a Heart for God, it gives you enough of a taste of Buddhism, the monastery itself and a retreat inside the monastery to whet your appetite for more.<br />I hope to find more books in this series.	2002-07-29

I am currently listening to it on an old, unabridged version read by Michael York that I got from the library. Unfortunatly, the library will have to replace this worn out, but wonderful audio version with the lifeless version now offered by Harper Audio. The reader is lifeless and dull, reading the text so quickly and without expression that I think maybe he was reading it against his will. It's AWFUL.  Read the book rather than buying this rotten version. OR - go to the library in hopes that they still have the audio book read by Michael York.

Ostensibly, it is a story about a child who is sick in bed and has bad dreams.  It all ends happily. It's a fine book to share with your children.<br />But, you could read it this way... Johnny Lion is sick in bed and, after taking some \\"bad red medicine\\" begins to hallucinate. He sees an owl and a giant bunny in his room. His mother and daddy keep pushing the bad red medicine on him: \\"'Oh no,'said Johnny Lion. 'I do not want any more of that red medicine.' Johnny Lion did not want any more owls. He did not want any more red rabbits. But Father Lion said, 'Yes, you must take your medicine.' So the little lion opened his mouth wide and took the medicine.\\"<br />Later he comes down from his \\"bad red medicine\\" high and has a nice dream: \\"He dreamed he was a big big lion...He had a big, big yellow mane. He dreamed he had big, big paws. He dreamed he had a big, huge mouth and big white teeth...Then he ran into Mother and Father Lion's room. The big, huge lion opened his moth wide and went, 'ROAR!' 'Oh, oh, oh,' said Father Lion. 'Help, help help!' cried Mother Lion.\\"<br />That's what they get for pushing that bad red medicine! What a sweet dream: \\" 'Good morning,' someone said. It was Mother Lion. 'Did you have sweet dreams?' Father Lion said. 'Oh yes, indeed,' Johnny Lion said.<br />A great book. It's twisted and I love it. You will too.	2002-03-15

PIG'S EVENING OUT	Books	3	4	12	N	N	A little icky	The first time I saw this book I thought nothing of it other than - it's a cute story about pigs victorious over the big bad wolf. A classic folktale theme. But then I read the book to a group of children in a storytime and got some suprising reactions. A few of the children were pretty disturbed by this story.  I have to admit, it is troubling. The pigs vs big bad wolf theme works fine in a folklore context, but when you take the wolf and make her into a babysitter...<br />This book is about parents unknowingly hiring a bad person as a babysitter. They know nothing about her. &quot;I don't like babysitters,&quot; said Benjamin.  &quot;Oh,&quot; said Mrs Pig, looking vague, &quot;well, she's coming from the agency so I'm not sure what her name is, but you're sure to like her.&quot;<br />The babysitter turns out to have bad intentions towards the children. After Mr. and Mrs Pig leave the house she creeps up to the children's bedroom and snatches one of the children from the bed.<br />This story has very quickly lost its innocence. If you can see past its modern connotations, that's fine. It is a good adventure. But it is just a little too icky for me.	2002-03-15

I think that it WAS written as a children's story and that back when it was written children accepted difficult language more easily than now. Today we underestimate the power of a child's mind and reasoning and we make the mistake of dumbing down literature and arts for children. But that's another issue..... Regarding the story - as I said, I loved the story as a child, never got the &quot;theology&quot; of this book confused with the theology I learned from church (As I remember it,I knew that people didn't really become angels - or if I thought that at the time I quickly lost that misconception as I became older.)<br />I picked the book up again as an adult (after not having read it for years) and found that the story now makes me cry.<br />This is an extremely heart wrenching story for adults, but a comforting one for children.	2001-09-28

One of the customer/reviewers said &quot;I doubt that any of us would have heard of him or his writings if he hadn't become a monk. As a lay writer, he would have been forgotten long ago.&quot;  That's true, I'm sure. But thanks to the Holy Spirit, Thomas Merton became a Trappist Monk, wrote this and other spiritual works and now many are brought to God through his writings.  The book doesn't have to be &quot;great literature&quot; to get across a good message. I don't think Merton was setting out to write a literary masterpiece and the book should not be judged as such. It should be judged as the story of a man's life.  As for Merton's spiritual dabblings... why does the scope of his journey make his journey any less valid? We are all searching - should we search on only one road?  If you don't want to read this book, fine. If you do want to read this book it's because you are meant to.	2001-05-30

In general, I thought that this was a wonderful resource. I am a little bit concerned about a couple of things.  On July 25, the author lists St. Christopher Day as a Catholic celebration. She does mention that because not much can be proved about the existence of Christopher, he was removed from the canon. True... then why did she include this in the book?  As far as I know and as far as I can determine, this is not a day that is even celebrated in spite of the canon. The actual feast day of July 25 is St. James day.  I also wondered why the author listed St. Christopher Day as specifically a Catholic celebration but other Catholic observances/celebrations she listed as Christian. The feast of The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary on August 15 is listed as a Christian observance as is Corpus Christi. True, both are Christian celebrations, but if you are being specific in other places in the book I'd think that with these two in particular, you'd want to specify Catholic. I noticed that in the list of books consulted in the back of the book, the author lists many general works about holidays and celebrations. She also lists specific works about Judaism, Islam, and Hinduism. She apparantly did not consult a book of Saints or a book of the Christian Calendar. It appears that she relied on the general works for this information.  I wonder why. As I said, this book is generally very good and presents quite a bit of information. But the fuzzy information and presentation regarding the Christian and Catholic days left me wondering about the rest of it.	2001-01-17

Obviously anti-christian, the author gloms together a bunch of winter-time religious and secular traditions and calls it &quot;YULE&quot;. She even includes Kwanzaa in this, which doesn't really have a whole lot to do with &quot;The Season&quot;. I am certainly aware of the pagan roots of many Christmas traditions. I am aware that Christmas was placed where it is on the calendar to counteract pagan festials. But, to suggest that Christians referred to Christmas as &quot;the birth of the Son&quot; because &quot;Son&quot; and &quot;sun&quot; rhyme and many pagans would think that they were referring to &quot;the Sun&quot; instead of the &quot;Son&quot; is just hooey.

The reviewer states: &quot;Her textseems like the record of a pleasurable, meandering conversation exchanging anecdotes about their childhood than a measured, reflective study.&quot; Maybe that's because it was a conversation about childhood, not a study of the Catholic Church.  I was wary of this book. I thought that it might be a &quot;I survived Catholicism&quot; Catholic-bashing type book. I was pleasantly surprised.  This book is about a woman's journey from childhood to adulthood. It is centered by experiences with her religion. That makes perfect sense because the seven sacraments are rites of passage for Catholics. To be sure she did have some horror stories to tell about her experiences in the Pre-Vatican II church, but she seems to have learned that The Church is populated by people - and people fail.  Those wretched nuns she described did fail the church and maybe the church failed them. But, as anyone who knows anything about the Catholic Church, the Church has made such progress. Manning seems to recognize that. Or at least forgive the Church for it's transgressions. She sees past the human failings of the Church and sees the grace within.  END	2000-04-07

Dr. Ralph helped  them come to terms with the misinformation or mis-interpretation they've been suffering from.  Dr. Ralph's views are  not her own. This approach to scripture is not something new. In fact, it  is the contextualist approach to scripture that the Catholic Church teaches  and has been teaching for years.	2000-04-03

I knew the minute I saw it that it was the best picture book I'd seen (or would see) all year.  I rarely buy picture books for myself since I have no children of my own. I will purchase this one. I can't live without it.  I have to open it up every once in a while  and look at the beautiful illustration.	2000-01-17

Presenting Preschool Storytime	Books	5	11	12	N	N	The favorite of all the children's librarians I know	All of the children's librarians in my system love this book and would be lost without it. It is their &quot;storytime bible&quot;.  Jane Cobb has come up with the most helpful storytime resource I have seen in ages (and I  have seen a lot). I've had this book for a long time, but was moved to just  now write a comment on it. I was checking Amazon to see if Ms. Cobb had  maybe written another like it.  I would hate to see &quot;I'm a Little  Teapot&quot; go out of print.  Future children's librarians should not be  deprived of such a treasure.	1999-10-22

After reading this book I felt that I had read a novel. What wonderful characters, what a rich story.  The story is satisfying in itself, but add the illustrations and you have a book about real people. I would love to  read a novel or see a movie based on this story. Just the few pages of a  picture book isn't enough. Loved this book!	1998-12-29

But, I laughed when I got to the part about the nativity scene figures running around shopping.  Every year there is another bittersweet christmas story about  some poor soul that makes a selfless sacrifice and is rewarded.  There's  nothing wrong with that...sometimes the story is truly moving.<br />This one,  though, was pretty amusing. I see it as a parody of the type of story I  described above. Remember, I DO like the book.  Just have a different take  on it, that's all.	1998-11-19
