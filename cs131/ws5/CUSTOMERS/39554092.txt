That's a reasonable claim and he makes his points convincingly. However, other sections of the book brought questions. Allow me to explain.<br /><br />Is someone who is quick to absorb the visual stimulation of pop-culture a 'smart' person? It seems the intelligent person not only digests ideas, but produces them. Thinking creatively and originally is different than merely reacting to and retaining data - whether that's data from a text book, a movie, or a video game.<br /><br />Here's the point Johnson seems to gloss over, mental stimulation is not a virtue in itself. To build on that, is all learning (knowledge) 'good'? More specifically, is there a difference between wisdom and trivia? See, that's the huge question Johnson misses. If he proves all 'facts' are equal in their importance then his thesis becomes much stronger. However in the real world some knowledge is far less important than other knowledge.<br /><br />Let me use an example. Say we have two kids - aged 10. One kid can tell you the title, manufacturer, plot-line, and year of every video game ever produced. The other kid can recite the Declaration of Independence, tell you who signed it and why it's important. I'd suggest while both kids may be equally 'smart', both are not equally intelligent.<br /><br />Here's the point. Johnson is so focused on defending the media forms of today that he ignores the messages they send us.  At the same time he uses the term 'good' in the title of his book. That's a term of value differentiation. Is he implying some things are 'good' and others are not? That's a moral distinction.  If that's what he's saying, then what would be the 'bad' that could be promoted via today's media?  ... a preoccupation with murder? sex? hedonism?  Are those things bad?  I wish he would have at least attempted to deal with the content (messages) of pop-culture.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line. Let's assume pop-culture is making us smarter. A different question would be, is it also making is better? Is it actually good for us? Is it building character, courage, heroism, altruism, and charity? I remain unconvined that it is.) of pop-culture. <br /> <br />Here's the bottom line. Let's assume pop-culture is making us smarter. A different question would be, is it also making is better?

Creating community. (They hold community together.)<br />2. Preventing violations which lead to wounds.<br />3. Speaking to the human condition.<br />4. Showing us how to avoid being enslaved.<br />5. Revealing how to avoid a life of solitude.<br /><br />Each of these seems to make sense.  However, I noticed that Hedges' interpretation of the commandments appears to be horizontally focused.  That is, person to person.  This is opposed to an interpretation which is focused more on the vertical.  That is, person to God.<br /><br />Hedges goes on to state that no religion can interpret the mystery of God.  And says, once we believe we understand the will of God we become a great menace to others.  I find this to be an interesting statement found in a book on the Ten Commandments.  Are the commandments from God?  If so, do they reveal the will of God?  If so, is a person who believes that a menace to society?<br /><br />Hedges also says the commandments do not protect us from evil.  They protect us from committing evil.  I believe there is a lot of truth in those words.  At the same time, have the commandments perfectly kept anyone from committing evil?  If not, then have all people broken at least one commandment?  If so, does that make us each a lawbreaker?  If so, and the commandments are the revelation of God's will, then what are the consequences to breaking God's law?  These are questions I wish Hedges had at least attempted to answer.<br /><br />However, to be fair the meat of the book is anecdotal as Hedges conveys stories of individuals who have struggled with keeping a particular commandment.	2005-06-09

He calls this time the Long Emergency, a time of changing everything about how we live.<br /><br />He first goes through all of the possible solutions for another energy source and systematically knocks each down.  There will be no widely touted \\"hydrogen economy\\", there will be no fulfillment of the wishful notions about rescuing our way of life with alternative \\"renewables\\", nor will coal save us, we may need to turn to  nuclear power, but that's no utopian solution either.<br /><br />In short, the Long Emergency will require making other arrangements for the way we live. We are in a special predicament due to a set of unfortunate choices we made as a society in the twentieth century.  Kunslter writes, \\"Before long, the suburbs will fail us in practical terms. We made the ongoing development of housing subdivisions, highway strips, fried-food shacks and shopping malls the basis of our economy, and when we have to stop making more of those things, the bottom will fall out.\\"<br /><br />What's his solution?  We re-scale virtually everything we do and how we do it.... \\"The successful regions in the twenty-first century will be the ones surrounded by viable farming hinterlands that can reconstitute locally sustainable economies on an armature of civic cohesion. Small towns and smaller cities have better prospects than the big cities.<br /><br />Kunslter paints a picture of the dark ages.  His solution is almost feudal in its simplicity.  Plant a garden - live low to the ground - raise some chickens.<br /><br />Of course he couches that in emotive language when he writes, \\"The survivors will have to cultivate a religion of hope -- that is, a deep and comprehensive belief that humanity is worth carrying on. If there is any positive side to stark changes coming our way, it may be in the benefits of close communal relations, of having to really work intimately (and physically) with our neighbors.\\"<br /><br />Has Kunslter given up?

More specifically, as the past is erased, re-written, or ignored the rich Judeo-Christian history of Europe is being left behind.  And at what cost?<br /><br />Weigel asks provocative questions... Why is European productivity dwindling to an all time low?  Why is European politics rife with senselessness?  Why does Sweden have a considerably higher level of its population living below the poverty line? Why is Europe undergoing the 'greatest sustained reduction in European population since the Black Death of the 14th century'?<br /><br />Could the recent woes of Europe be tied to the ever decreasing Christian minority on this now decidedly post-Christian continent?<br /><br />As I ponder Weigel's book I'm reminded of Orwell's quote, \\"We have now sunk to a depth at which restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men.\\"  Weigel restates the obvious, \\"culture determines civilization\\".  And he goes on to say, without its distinctly Christian history, Europe would not be what it is.  Unfortunately, he may have more accurately written, `Europe would not have been what it was.'<br /><br />However, from the perspective of the Christian tradition there is more to lament than the secondary effects of a decline in productivity, and art.  That is, merely reviving religion as an end in itself is not what Europe needs, but rather a call back to its first love, the God who blesses and rewards those who diligently seek Him.<br /><br />Of course the current intellectual elites regard God as an embarrassment as they continue to scoff at His name.  What is the final price?  The world has yet to know.	2005-04-09

McLaren does more than this when he suggests there's a need to break down the notion of hell in order to allow people to re-imagine something better. This, he says, allows people to more fully understand God's grace. - p.106<br /><br />In brief McLaren asserts: Hell is a metaphor, not a reality - p.80 People suffer enough in this world for hell to be real - p.85 If hell is real then people are seen as disposable - p.83 The doctrine of hell led to the holocaust - p.83 Anyone who suggests others are going to hell cannot love them - p.83<br /><br />However, here's my thinking - if hell really does exist, if it's a place outside of God's goodness, love, beauty, then it seems that magnifies God's grace. That is, if the Christian has truly been 'saved' from something horrible, then the cross becomes something awesome, worthy of being held onto, and Jesus is rightly called the Savior.<br /><br />McLaren's further assertions are these:<br />1. Jesus isn't concerned with our believing the right things, rather He wants actions and fruit bearing - p.121 (Isn't it possible to do the right things for the wrong reasons? If so, is right belief necessary for right action?)<br />2. The gospel of Jesus isn't an answer to the human sin problem, rather it's God's love for the world - p.134 (If Jesus' death and suffering on the cross wasn't for our sin problem, then why did God allow Him to die?)<br />3. Post-protestant churches see 'everything' as spiritual formation. There's nothing worth disagreeing about - p.142 (Would this include Mormon, Jehovah Witness, and Unitarian churches? Is there any doctrinal issue worth taking a stand on?)<br />4. Justification by grace through faith isn't the gospel. The gospel is about bringing Jews and Gentiles together. (How was this accomplished if not through Jesus' death and the subsequent justification of believers?)<br />5. The church exists to focus on the good of the world and thereby be a blessing to the world. (Does the church primarily exist as the bride of Christ, and to bring glory and pleasure to God?)<br /><br />In summary McLaren holds to a universalistic view that all people will be judged at the end of the world for both the good and the bad they've done. Hell is not a reality. Therefore, do the best you can in fighting for social justice and change in this world.  However, that's not a Christian worldview, because that's not the gospel - rather the good news of Jesus being the Lamb who takes away the sins of the world is.<br /><br />Jesus alone is hope.

Friedman not only writes well, but does so on an important subject- globalization.  He states, \\"It is now possible for more people than ever to collaborate and compete in real time with more people on more different kinds of work from more different corners of the planet and on a more equal footing than at any previous time in the history of the world.\\"<br /><br />He claims, \\"When the world is flat, you can innovate without having to emigrate\\".  But, how did the world `become flat'?  Friedman suggest the trigger events were the collapse of communism, the dot-com bubble resulting in overinvestment in fiber-optic telecommunications, and the subsequent out-sourcing of engineers enlisted to fix the perceived Y2K problem.<br /><br />Those events created an environment where products, services, and labor are cheaper.  However, the West is now losing its strong-hold on economic dominance.  Depending on if viewed from the eyes of a consumer or a producer - that's either good or bad, or a combination of both.<br /><br />What is more sobering is Friedman's elaboration on Bill Gates' statement, \\"When I compare our high schools to what I see when I'm traveling abroad, I am terrified for our work force of tomorrow. In math and science, our fourth graders are among the top students in the world. By eighth grade, they're in the middle of the pack. By 12th grade, U.S. students are scoring near the bottom of all industrialized nations. . . . The percentage of a population with a college degree is important, but so are sheer numbers. In 2001, India graduated almost a million more students from college than the United States did. China graduates twice as many students with bachelor's degrees as the U.S., and they have six times as many graduates majoring in engineering. In the international competition to have the biggest and best supply of knowledge workers, America is falling behind.\\"<br /><br />Friedman sounds the alarm with a call for diligence and fortitude - academically, politically, and economically.  He sees a dangerous complacency, from Washington down through the public school system.  Students are no longer motivated. \\"In China today, Bill Gates is Britney Spears. In America today, Britney Spears is Britney Spears -- and that is our problem.\\"<br /><br />Questions I wish Friedman had explored in further detail are:<br /><br />1. When should countries do what benefits the global economy, and when should they look out for their own interests? (protectionism, tariffs, quotas, etc.)<br /><br />2.

He does so in a humble and accessible approach by limiting scholarship as an end in itself.  Rather, he knows when when to convince the reader with compelling evidence, and when to back away from mere dogmatic assertion.<br /><br />Certainly the Bible possesses some of the finest, most staggering, and beautiful statements every recorded.  Additionally, it's a book placing love, fear, and conviction in the hearts of people through various times, and in diverse places.  As a result, it's been the subject of some of the most contested battles witnessed through the corridors of history.<br /><br />The central 'shift' in history which Pelikan outlines is the reaction against a highly symbolic form of biblical interpretation common in the middle ages, and in some ancient times.  The conviction that perhaps the Bible literally means what it says was, to put it mildly, revolutionary.  Of course this assertion manifested itself in the reaction against Rome as it played out in the reformation.  And Pelikan allows these events to come to light and life.<br /><br />Pelikan's last chapter is a compilation of reflections on the Bible, including its persistent mystery, its enduring qualities, and its ability to capture our hearts and minds.

Paglia writes, \\"The only antidote to the magic of images is the magic of words.''  Here she demonstrates the power of words for suggesting images better than those seen with eyes.<br /><br />Paglia is captivated by poetry.  The reader's interest develops when she carefully (maybe a little dryly) commentates on one poem at a time - avoiding general brushstrokes as she identifies the subtleties from various lines.  As it's been said, \\"from this book you could doubt several aspects of her taste in poetry. But you couldn't doubt her love of it.\\"<br /><br />You can hear Paglia's disappointment when she writes, \\"Along the way I've encountered so many people in the publishing world, in magazines, who said to me, you know, 'I always keep up with the new novels, but not poetry.' These are really literary people, and even they feel poetry no longer speaks to them.\\"<br /><br />Paglia suggests an explanation for the decline in the love of poetry, \\"Thanks to 25 years of post-structuralism in our elite colleges, we have this idea now that you are supposed to use your pseudo-sociological critical eye to look down on the work and find everything that's wrong with it,\\" ...this style of teaching just nips students' enthusiasm in the bud.\\"<br /><br />However, her statement is tempered by what I appreciate most - her discrimination regarding true talent and her lack of tolerance for those poetry artists who insist on using it as an instrument of civil rights - while at the same time lacking excellence in their work.<br /><br />While Paglia's selection of 43 poems may be `eclectic', she comments on superior works including Shelley's retro-prophetic `Ozymandias',  Coleridge's heroic `Kubla Khan', and Wallace Stevens's gem `Disillusionment of Ten O'Clock'<br /><br />Paglia's strength is teaching us how to visualize implication in the once inconsequential, and thereby to making a poem alive and memorable.

First of all, as far as entertainment goes the Star Wars series is some of the best!  Furthermore, I realize there's real spiritual hunger that causes people to be drawn to Star Wars.  It's a powerful series, with a powerful story.  However, the answer to that spiritual hunger cannot be found in the films.<br /><br />While there are some similarities between Jedi teachings and the biblical worldview, the differences are far greater.  As a result, I wish Staub had been more thorough in contrasting the two belief systems instead of primarily comparing the similarities.<br /><br />Staub wants to emphasize the similarities in order to assist, \\"Christians who want to claim Jedi wisdom as their own.\\"  My question is, what if Jedi wisdom is contrary to scripture - should that wisdom still be pursued?<br /><br />Staub writes, \\"Star Wars seems to have stolen our message and wrapped it in science fiction.\\"  What message is that?  There's a God in heaven who loves us?  Humanity is separated from Him because of sin?  Jesus died on the cross to forgive us, redeem us to the Father, and bring us a newness of life?  These are the beliefs of Christians everywhere.  However, none of these elements are found in the Star Wars series. As a result, Staub's claims are either an over-simplification or he's reading too much into the films.<br /><br />Remember, a Jedi sees the force as the binding piece that holds all life together.  It's said to surround us and direct our actions.  In this worldview the `force' resembles more of a pantheistic teaching than a biblical one.  More specifically, if everything is part of the `force' then everything is one.  This stands in contrast to the Christian view which claims God is separate and distinction from creation, as well as a personal being.  The `force' is not personal, nor loving, nor capable of having personal relationships.  Perhaps the greatest distinction is that the `force' has both a light side and a dark side - the God of the Bible is light and there is no darkness in Him. (I John 1)<br /><br />Lastly, and most importantly, was Jesus a Jedi?  No, Jesus wasn't trying to tap into some universal force. He was (and is) the Creator of the Universe and all of its laws.  He certainly didn't use mind control to influence people. He spoke the truth and allowed people to accept or reject - Him.

Americans are particularly susceptible because they are descended from immigrants with a higher frequency of the \\"exploratory and novelty-seeking D4-7 allele\\" in the dopamine receptor system, which predisposes them to impulsivity and addiction.\\"<br /><br />I'm not convinced about this.  America is too big a melting pot for such a seemingly broad-sweeping, all-inclusive answer.  Furthermore, I question the science behind the assertion.<br /><br />However, I believe he's spot on when he writes, \\"The mind is prone to addiction,\\" Whybrow claims, \\"Everybody is capable of becoming addicted to something - wine, sex, food, exercise, the very pursuit of happiness.  Paradoxically, freedom without restraint is enervating, not liberating. There's a difference between pleasure and happiness; happiness depends on limits.\\"'<br /><br />Here is the greatest contribution of the book.  His statement is something which is unpopular, and at the same time corresponds with the human condition.  \\"Happiness depends on limits.\\"  This is where I believe Whybrow breaks through, but at the same time leaves the reader asking for more.  Where are those limits to be placed?  What functions in society should determine limits?  Are boundaries objective - applying to all people, in all times, and in all places?  Do they move from individual to individual?  Does God exist?  If so, does His will/perspective determine where the boundaries of the creation are set?

However, it was the substance of the book that caught my attention - and got me thinking.  Allow me to express my questions below.<br /><br />Regarding Lamott's faith maybe hers is best be described as general spirituality.  Some have described her as, \\"A Presbyterian in dreadlocks who wears a red cotton cord blessed by the Dalai Lama and a Virgin Mary medallion... She believes in karma, and swears. A lot.\\" However, she also claims to be a 'born-again Christian'. I wonder what that means, (born-again Christian?) and wish she would have revealed more about that.<br /><br />She's been applauded for her easily trusted essays as they don't try to 'convince the reader of anything'. Is there anything she's garnered through her years worthy of promoting to others? If so, wouldn't convincing 'the reader of anything' be a virtue?<br /><br />Lamott's spirituality comes into clearer focus when she writes, \\"God has extremely low standards.\\" I was thinking, would Jesus have suggested the same or the opposite?  She goes on to say, \\"Pray, take care of people, be actively grateful for your blessings, give away your money -- you're cool. You're in.\\" I wondered how the Christian doctrine of salvation through faith in Jesus fits with her suggestion of salvation through being a good person? Are they the same - because they appear to be different?<br /><br />Of course her trademark quirky sense of humor helps smooth over many of the rough spots. In fact, she uses it with incredible precision.  However, I wanted her to explain her terms and ideas in greater detail.	2005-03-16

As an example he writes about a project he was working on to interview Osama Bin Laden, \\"Our bosses saw him as an obscure Arab of no interest to our viewers,\\" Fenton writes. \\"More concerned with saving dollars than pursuing the story, they killed the project.\\"<br /><br />Fenton goes on to suggest it's not possible for networks to provide in-depth coverage of worldly events when they're compacted to just 18 minutes of broadcast time.<br /><br />He really doesn't pull any punches when he writes, \\"Once you get halfway through the CBS Evening News, the rest of it you can turn off,\\" Fenton goes on... \\"There's nothing there you need to know. It's an attempt to entertain people and pump up ratings. If I want entertainment, I'll watch 'The Daily Show.'\\"<br /><br />In short, it's a hard hitting account from a long respected insider.

Certainly this would be a start, but I'm not convinced it's the ultimate answer.<br /><br />Warner believes we need political solutions that are economically feasible, able to collectively give mothers and families a break.<br /><br />*  We need incentives like tax subsidies to encourage corporations to adopt family-friendly policies.<br /><br />*  We need government-mandated child care standards..<br /><br />*  We need flexible, affordable, locally available, high-quality part-time day care so that stay-at-home moms can get a life of their own.<br /><br />*  We need new initiatives to make it possible for mothers to work part-time (something most mothers say they want to do) by creating vouchers or bigger tax credits to make child care more affordable.<br /><br />*  In general, we need to alleviate the economic pressures that currently make so many families' lives so high-pressured, through progressive tax policies that would transfer our nation's wealth back to the middle class.<br /><br />She rounds these requests off fairly well by suggesting, don't blame the media or politicians for the problem. \\"It's us -- this generation of mothers,\\" she writes. \\"And it's the way our culture has groomed and greeted us, mixing promises with politics, feminism with 'family values,' science and sound bites and religion and, above all, fear into a combustible combination that is nothing less than perfect madness.\\"<br /><br />Warner makes the claim that everything has jumbled together to make `perfect madness' - but doesn't tell us how to untangle the knot.

The authors present nine categories claimed to present `clutter' or `box baggage' for modern churches. These are the things the authors believe should be left behind in order to embrace `innovation'....<br /><br />1. Hierarchy - What does a hierarchy-free church look like?  Would elders/deacons constitute hierarchy?<br /><br />2. Structure/Organization - What is a modern day example of an effective, unorganized worship service?<br /><br />3. Property/Location - Which contemporary churches exist with no property or location?<br /><br />4. Conflict - Not sure what this means.<br /><br />5. Centralized Control - If there is no `centralized control' does this mean there is no headship?<br /><br />6. Ordination - Is ordination when a church body examines a person's beliefs and qualifications for ministry in light of scripture?<br /><br />7. Clergy - As far as I know there are no clergy-free churches in my area.  This one is difficult to imagine.<br /><br />8. Seminaries - I guess this one is self-evident.  If there is no ordination, control, or clergy there would be no need for seminaries.<br /><br />9. Denominations - Is to abandon denominations the same as abandoning doctrinal statements? If so, what would differentiate churches if not their core beliefs?<br /><br />What does it mean for the church to `move forward'?  Is innovation simply moving away from the things the church has always done?  What are the foundational elements of the church, which if left behind would leave the church with no real effect?  I wish the authors had attempted to identify those things which can and should never change.	2005-02-17

Rather, he's asking for consistancy between the various positions including poverty, human rights, corporate regulation, crime, life, and dignity.<br /><br />The best summary on this book would be, \\"It provides a corrective to a religious Right that has truncated the discussion of moral values to several push-button issues and to a Left that separates considerations of religious and moral values from formulation of public policy.\\"  Clearly, both are needed.<br /><br />Jim Wallis says Republicans like the language of faith, but use it narrowly and selectively. Democrats, on the other hand, are clearly uncomfortable with the subject. \\"Democrats need to recover a moral vocabulary, to put principles ahead of programs,\\" contends Mr. Wallis. \\"Don't start with policies. Start with values and then say how your policies flow from them.\\" That seems like such a balanced, common-sense approach.  At the same time it's something that's rarely done, and something I need to be reminded of as I engage the public square.<br /><br />Wallis and his associates want to expand the discussion of moral values from the Christian Right's focus on abortion and gay marriage to include a biblical concern for poverty, care of the natural environment and opposition to unjust war. They speak of a \\"consistent ethic of life.\\" I think that's both fair and needed.	2005-02-13

However, I wished he'd have co-author this book with an ethics professor, or an Old Testament authority, or at least someone respected in the field of religious studies - as this would have lended to the books' strength and credibility.<br /><br />The reason I suggest this is because the premise which the book rests on is derived from the Torah manuscript of Genesis - and with that said, I'm not convinced Polhemus treats this text fairly.  I'd like to suggest why.<br /><br />To rightly understand what Polhemus calls the, \\"disreputable Bible story of father-daughter incest\\" a firm grasp on both the literary context and the cultural context of the event is helpful.  With that said, even a plain reading of the text shows these incestual events are not merely the result of passions run astray.<br /><br />Lot's daughters believed themselves and their father the sole survivors of universal destruction; humankind, they thought, depended on their breaking taboo by procreating with their father. As a result, they succeed in getting their father drunk, and then fulfilling their plan to have children through him. The manuscript gives no indication that Lot initiated this event, nor does it suggest his daughters were drawn to him for any other reason than their desire for children.<br /><br />Polhemus places this account in the the modern context of older men desiring younger women and younger women being thirsty for the power and wealth of older men. In his words, \\"...in which daughters fall in love with their father's lives and older men are tempted by the intoxicating power and promise of youth\\".<br /><br />Certainly, both of these motivating factors (lust for youth and lust for power) may be true in what we observe today in society, but to derive those conclusions from this ancient text is to unnaturally reshape the story itself.	2005-02-08

That's true in sports, business, and politics. Consequently, Whitman's insider claims are worthy of consideration and evaluation.<br /><br />One of her principal claims is, \\"The numbers show that while the president certainly did energize his political base, the red state/blue state map changed barely at all -- suggesting that he had missed an opportunity to significantly broaden his support in the most populous areas of the country,\\" This is likely a valid criticism, one that goes beyond party lines as it applies to both parties equally.<br /><br />Whitman was often at odds with the White House on issues such as setting limits on air pollutants, power plant emissions and global warming. Her tenure was marked by complaints from conservatives that she was too liberal. I wish her book had included specifics regarding her proposals, including the costs to businesses and the benefits to the environment. In short, a cost/benefit analysis would have been helpful in determining the merit of what she was fighting for.<br /><br />One thing that struck me is how much of the book appeared to be the antithesis of Zel Miller's. For instance, she writes, \\"A clear and present danger Republicans face today is that the party will now move so far to the right that it ends up alienating centrist voters and marginalizing itself,\\" I wonder if she read Miller's book?<br /><br />Whitman writes, \\"It is time for Republican moderates to assert forcefully and plainly that this is our party, too, that we not only have a place but a voice, and not just a voice but a vision that is true to the historic principles of our party and our nation, not one tied to an extremist agenda,\\" Were those same moderate Republicans happy with a Bush victory?  She'd have a tough time convincing anyone moderate Republicans were hoping for a Bush loss.<br /><br />Certainly, Whitman was a bit of a misfit in the Bush Cabinet, coming in as an abortion supporter, and taking a job that is not a quick route to popularity in a GOP administration. Regarding diversity in the differing parties, I wonder how many pro-life candidates were considered for the same role in the Clinton administration. Doesn't Bush's appointing Whitman to this position demonstrate his willingness to reach out to such Republicans? If so, and Bush is now maligned by such a book, how willing will he be to make similar concessions in the future? Maybe the carrot approach (praising the good) would have been more productive for Whitman to use instead of the stick (criticizing the bad)?ing a job that is not a quick route to popularity in a GOP administration.

Millions of Americans fervently believe they do, and ugly facts will not change their minds. They turn their backs on the damage America creates, almost thoughtlessly, around the world. American corporations who do not want to tolerate being regulated at home move overseas where they can pile asbestos in huge mounds that Asian children play on, sell potent pharmaceuticals over the counter in Thailand without the need of prescriptions, create a lethal gas leak in Bhopal, India, and generally damage the ecology in any way they choose. Being an American means all of those things. It's just as American to be the largest supplier of arms in the world and send your troops into battle to be killed by these same arms. It's American to promote free markets whatever the cost, as one native culture after another is despoiled and corrupted by the dollar.\\"<br /><br />Here are some questions I'm still chewing on.<br /><br />1. Is war ever an appropriate response? (I'm thinking of US involvement in WWII)<br /><br />2. Should violence be used to stop an atrocity? (I'm thinking of Rwanda 1994)<br /><br />3.

If you also happen to be a word-lover you'll likely appreciate linguist Christopher J. Moore's translation of some of the world's most \\"untranslatable expressions\\". Yes, I know, translating untranslatable words does seem... peculiar. However, the book certainly makes for an intriguing read - and to show why, here are three of my favorites:<br /><br />\\"esprit de I'escalier\\" [es-pree de less-ka/-iay] (idiom) French -- A witty remark that occurs to you too late, literally on the way down the stairs. The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations defines esprit de l'escalier as, \\"An untranslatable phrase, the meaning of which is that one only thinks on one's way downstairs of the smart retort one might have made in the drawing room.\\"<br /><br />\\"korinthenkacker\\" [core-in-ten-cuck-er] (noun) German -- A \\"raisin pooper\\" -- that is, someone so taken up with life's trivial detail that they spend all day poohing mere raisins. You can spot these types a mile off -- it's that irritating pen pusher or filing fanatic whose favorite job is tidying up the stationery cupboard.<br /><br />\\"tatemae\\" [tah-tay-mye] (noun) Japanese -- A term often translated as \\"form,\\" but it also has the specific cultural meaning of \\"the reality that everyone professes to be true, even though they may not privately believe it.\\" For privately held views, the Japanese have a different term, honne, meaning, \\"the reality that you hold inwardly to be true, even though you would never admit it publicly.\\" The British civil servant muttering the reproach \\"bad form, old boy\\" over a drink in the club, may be expressing something very close to the quality of tatamae.<br /><br />Ok, so you wouldn't likely use any of these to impress your friends.  However, I believe there's benefit in understanding concepts from other culture.  It expands the mind.	2005-01-23

And every time I see those shelves of unread books I'm hit with two emotions simultaneously.  First, I admire the condition and selection of my books and then I feel like a deadbeat parent who's long neglected one's children.  I suppose joy and sorrow have never meshed so well in a unified whole.<br /><br />And Hornby presents similar feelings not too mysterious regarding his lack of discipline in consuming his books.  He writes, \\"I certainly 'intend' to read all of them, more or less. My 'intentions' are good. Anyway, it's my money. And I'll bet you do it, too.\\"<br /><br />Additionally, I like the fact that Hornby is a discerning reader who searches for the `mesmerizing books'. These are the ones Hornby finds worthy of the hunt - those that will make you \\"walk into a lamp-post\\" while reading them.<br /><br />Hornby's wit and caustic humor make this an entertaining read for the bibliophile, or for anyone aspiring to own more books than days left to live.	2005-01-21

If not, how does a person rightly evaluate their own desires? 3. That is, are there things, which I want which I shouldn't want?<br /><br />4. What if a person has every desire of their heart, but still has no happiness, no peace, and no joy?<br /><br />5. Does that mean happiness is not found in our desires?<br /><br />6. Or does it mean there's something more - beyond our desire for our own happiness which we are designed for?<br /><br />7. Do bad things ever happen to good people?<br /><br />8. If so, were those things attracted by the person?<br /><br />9. Let's say a 14-year-old girl comes down with Leukemia, should she try to figure out what she did to attract the disease?<br /><br />10.

Hewitt suggests the blogosphere allows for the organization of dissent, which is focused, credentialed, complete, and--crucially--publicized.  In short, he champions blogs as the force providing accountability to `legacy media'.<br /><br />Any fair-minded observer of `legacy media' would conclude not all journalism is good journalism.  Of course, likewise, not all blogs are good journalism either.  However, the point Hewitt makes is that, instead of a one-sided, agenda-driven media, we've been given balance through the quickness and efficiency of the blogsosphere.  That is, one of the ways blogs provide benefits is through their timely response to periodic mainstream media error.<br /><br />Hewitt claims the `old media' is increasingly devoid of serious scholarship, and is slowly being reduced to mere polemic.  The irony here is that Hewitt's communicating in one of the oldest media forms - the book.  OK, to be fair, Hewitt isn't suggesting all other media forms are 'legacy', rather, he's pointing to the perviously dominate outlets more than the forms.  (LA Times beware, and you too Newsweek and CBS.)<br /><br />In short, he suggests the blogs must be taken seriously, and they are rapidly becoming so.  There are too many qualified journalists who run blogs for them not to have an enormous impact on our changing world.  Finally, Hewitt claims the accountability they provide is long overdue.<br /><br />Has Hewitt been wrong before?  Of course he has - he claimed national security was going to be far and away the primary voter issue of 2004.  However, is he likely right about the increasing importance of the blogosphere, and why it's growing in influence and power?  I believe so.	2004-12-28

First of all, I appreciate Dr. Warren's goal of courtship ending in marriage. This of course stands out from the vast majority of `dating books' which often seem to present dating as an end in itself. There are no `ten keys to hot romance' in this book. Rather, Warren's purpose is to address compatibility and marriage.<br /><br />In short, his realistic approach is refreshing. He doesn't buy into the pop-culture idea that each person is looking for the one person on the planet they were destined for from eternity past.<br /><br />Warren writes, \\"Surprisingly, many singles hold to the notion-either consciously or subconsciously-that there is one perfect, preordained partner for them. They were made for each other, the thinking goes, and they must simply locate this person or forever feel incomplete.... But, frankly, I think this idea is more fantasy than reality, more storybook whimsy than real-world wisdom.\\" And I believe he's right.<br /><br />Warren has an enormous bank of personal experience in both marriage and engagement counseling. He writes, \\"During my 35 years as a psychologist, I have counseled dozens of men and women who were convinced they'd married \\"the wrong person,\\" but who then went on to create top-notch relationships.\\"<br /><br />His emphasis appears to be how a person finds the ideal person. However, that's fairly different than what the book presents. What he's really promoting is a common sense approach to finding a `compatible' person. With that said, I wish he had spent more time on how a person becomes more `compatible' themself.<br /><br />With that said, Warren does touch on this topic. He writes, \\"I believe soul mates are made, not born. You start with the ingredients for a highly compatible, successful relationship, and then you work to develop closeness and intimacy. Does this mean you lower your standards when it comes to finding a partner? Absolutely not! It simply means you 'expand your field of vision.'\\"<br /><br />I found the Appendix to be particularly helpful.<br />- Appendix A 'Three Secrets to a Great Relationship'<br />- Appendix B 'Twenty Question for Evaluation'<br />- Appendix C 'Items of Similarity or Difference in a Relationship'<br /><br />In short, there's very little hype or unrealistic pie-in-the-sky promises made in the book.

Her recommendations to embrace love and get rid of fear is something I know I certainly want. However, I began to wonder. Are there things I shouldn't love? Likewise, are there things I should be afraid of? If so, it would have been helpful if Williamson had identified some examples.<br /><br />She also suggests we're not responsible for bad things that happen to us. However, is that always the case? Am I responsible for the choices I make? I wish Williamson had explained her claim further.<br /><br />Additionally, Williamson says there are many turns we take in life that make us feel regret, guilt, sorrow, or pain. And then suggests we must learn to 'push past' those things. I wonder, are there things in my life I really should feel regret and guilt for?  If so, what does 'pushing past' those things mean?<br /><br />On another note, Williamson suggests we must not give into our egos, which tell us we are separate from God, but instead surrender to God, 'of whom we are all a part'. Shortly thereafter she writes that we must go \\"from asking God to change the world to praying that He change us\\". If I need to be changed by God, then is that change intellectual, moral, or something else?  Furthermore, does asking imply God is a disctinct person?  I wanted her to be more specific.<br /><br />I hope the questions I've raised will be of benefit to readers. They've risen from my desire to know rightly and to be true to the truth.	2004-12-17

However, regarding the historical claims from the book Ehrman proceeds with clarity and precision as he focuses on 10 areas of concern.<br /><br />I didn't see that Ehrman is not concerned with theology.  His 10 areas of concern all have significant theological implications.  That is, if Ehrman is concerned with truth, which he obviously is, then his New Testament scholarship has theological consequences.  The difference is, he appears to limit his bias in his historical analysis.<br /><br />In short, while Ehrman is quick to give the `story' of the Da Vinci Code high marks he is quick to point out numerous factual errors as he systematically debunks the books claims.  He points out that...<br /><br />1. The Dead Sea Scrolls were not early `Christian' documents - but were rather copies of Old Testament books by a Jewish fringe group.<br /><br />2. Not all of the Jewish men in the first century were married, but rather many chose to remain celebate.<br /><br />3. Gnostic gospels were late documents which didn't have an enormous impact on Christian thought.<br /><br />4. The role of women in the early church was distinct from the cultural norms.<br /><br />5. Constantine didn't choose the four canonical gospels from a vast number of competing `gospels'.<br /><br />6. There is not a strand of historical evidence suggesting Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene.<br /><br />7. Nor did the church suppress `gospels' that told of a secret marriage.<br /><br />8.

Europe is certainly grand in it's history, architecture, high culture, and advancement in human rights. But is America really so bad as Reid would have one think? It appears he jumps on one end of the teeter-totter in order to make the other go up. Let me share some concerns I have with his book.<br /><br />I believe Reid's praise of Europe could have been done in a more generous way. That is, I'm not sure it's necessary to push off of America in order to lavish praise on Europe. Reid's over-arching assertion is that the European Union outperforms the United States of America not only economically, but culturally. (Europeans have more `class' than Americans.) I was wondering if his conclusions would be so readily accepted if he were making these claims about other people groups - Israel vs. Arabs, blacks vs. whites, men vs. women, the young vs. the old.<br /><br />To be fair, Reid focuses mostly on economics; and so, one could counter by talking about the higher tax rates, lower home ownership, higher living expenses, more imposing governments, etc. in Europe. However, that type of low-level 'knocking' seems to have limited benefit.<br /><br />What's more noticeable is Reid's omission of exploring the deeper issues related to the divide between the EU and USA. That is, he has little time for the idea that perhaps a worldview difference exists between the continents in the area of core values, morals, and beliefs.

His passion for learning and knowledge is contagious and it's that steady enthusiasm which makes this book pleasurable.<br /><br />Bloom starts out working from the premise that literature can inform our lives. Certainly this is well established and few would challenge him. It's working from this assertion that he develops his ideas that even contrary forms of wisdom have shaped the thinking of Western civilization. And it's here that he sounds almost Hegelian in his push towards greater knowledge through conflict and synthesis.<br /><br />One area I had hoped Bloom had developed more is the distinction between knowledge and wisdom.  Are they synonymous?  Is all knowledge wisdom?  Is some more valuable to the individual than other knowledge?<br /><br />Bloom describes those writers whose brand of wisdom he holds in highest esteem.  And it's here that I wanted Bloom to articulate specific criteria for the types of literature he would categorize as lending to wisdom.  He certainly elevates some works above others.  For instance he places Shakespeare, Cervantes, and others above the fray.  Additionally, he includes some books of the bible like Ecclesiastes and Job.  So, he elevates this subset, but then within this subset he doesn't seem to allow for a hierarchy - placing them all on equal footing.  My questions would be...<br /><br />1. Why are some works elevated above others?<br /><br />2. What criteria can be used to identify works of wisdom?<br /><br />3. Within the subset Bloom advocates how do we know none of these should be seen as more conducive for conveying wisdom?<br /><br />4. Do some works of literature accurately describe the human condition and others prescribe a resolution to that condition?  If so, which is of more value?<br /><br />5. What is the ultimate source of wisdom?<br /><br />Even with these questions posed; Bloom has made great contributions to the analysis of classic literature and ideas - in many of his books.

In so doing he suggests the competing ideologies hold distinctly different conceptions of morality.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some readers have concluded that it's pointless to engage the other side in discussion and debate.  I believe this misses Lakoff's point.  While two individuals may utilize differing worldviews when arguing a political topic it seems reasonable to conclude that such discourse would still be beneficial.  For example, reasons would still need to be given for why a position is held.  In so doing those reasons revealing the speaker's worldview would either prove to be well supported or weakly asserted.<br /><br /> Lakoff utilizes metaphors for government options between the \\"Strict Father Morality\\" vs. the \\"Nurturing Parent Morality\\".  I wonder if these models equally convey an idea of truth, morality and meaning?  What I mean is, do both sides espouse a need for government to uphold moral law?  If the voters are the `children' in Lakoff's model who `vote' for what type of government they want then when is it wise for voters to choose that which is best over that which may be preferred?  I think Lakoff could have gone further with this analogy than he did.<br /><br />One area of the book I remain unconvinced on is Lakoff's suggestion that political views are based not on objective evaluation of the opposing sides of various issues, but on feelings about the rightness of one's worldview.  It seems at least some individuals have well-supported convictions regarding various issues.  I wish he would have acknowledged at least some people have objectively evaluated why they believe what they believe.  Not all political views are based on 'feelings about rightness'.<br /><br />In the end, Lakoff's book is a needed push to rise above the common media.  The media that showers participants in the political process with never-ending images and sound bites.  It's Lakoff's type of big-picture thinking which truly contributes to a greater synthesis of ideas, understanding, and mutual respect.of big-picture thinking which truly contributes to a greater synthesis of ideas, understanding, and mutual respect.	2004-10-18

Why are so many people in the church defeated and living lives of mediocrity?  These are the questions Beth Moore addresses in this book.  And she does a great job providing practical and down to earth answers.<br /><br />It's been said that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.  And Moore's book addresses the importance of believing God for who He said He is and our need to rest in His grace.  God's intention is for believers to be found successful in His provisions through Jesus.  It's a reminder we all need and it's a message Moore is uniquely equipped to deliver.<br /><br />Of course so much of Moore's charm is conveyed through here verbal teaching.

We certainly use metaphors in the way we communicate, but primary their focus is on how metaphors are used in how we think. That is, how do they affect our understanding and perceptions?<br /><br />Metaphors seem to be visually oriented pictures by which we condense a greater concept into a manageable instance. These predefined packets of ideas are then used interchangeably as we think and evaluate choices.<br /><br />One item I wished the authors had included is how metaphors originate and how they are introduced into culture. Are they usually a simplistic example from everyday life, which captures the imagination and is easily impressed on the mind? Do they develop from years of common sense wisdom?<br /><br />Another aspect of metaphors which I believe to be worthy of consideration is the tendency to use them as a crutch. That is, it's easy to spout off the same old jargon and to speak in clich&eacute;s. It's even worse to think in clich&eacute;s. Does the person who relies too heavily on metaphors cease to `break new ground' in thinking originally and independently? I wanted the authors to address this possible darker side of the metaphor.<br /><br />Lastly, I was looking for instances of when commonly held metaphors were later proven to be faulty. In other words, when have metaphors caused a culture or people group to be stuck in a rut (um...is that a metaphor?) and prevented them from progressing? And, what means of cognition can be used to determine if metaphors are true or false?<br /><br />In the end this is a thought provoking book on a subject which effects every person, every day - whether they realize it or not.	2004-10-13

First of all, for those who've heard Osteen preach it's easy to see why people are attracted to him. His delivery is passionate and gentle.  He's likable, and comes across as a guy who'd likely be fun to have over for dinner.  However, I have some concerns regarding some of his teachings. Let me explain.<br /><br />Historically the Christian teaching on faith is that faith is a confident dependence on God's promises and character. It's exemplified by Jesus' words `not my will by thine' and the saints of old who believed God's ways were better than their ways.  It's a restful surrender to Jesus person and work - a kneeling at the cross.<br /><br />Olsteen turns faith around and suggests faith is a means by which a person can gain their desires in their lives. It's a means to rise above the obstacles of life and acquire health, abundance, and victory.<br /><br />Olsteen's manual becomes a self-help guide allowing readers to increase their self-esteem, discover power of thought, and let go of the past in order to choose to be happy. In other words, the book ends up being a guidebook for picking one's self up and giving themself a hand up.<br /><br />What Olsteen leaves out is a sound theology of suffering.  Why did God allow so many men and women of the Bible to suffer?  Was it because God is far more concerned with a person's character than their comfort.  Is it because He wants to be our shelter in the midst of the storm - and He deems that better than taking the storm away?  Would God rather grant us joy and peace from Him despite our circumstances or does He want to change our circumstances to conform to our desires?  These are the questions I wish Olsteen had addressed.	2004-10-06

Himmelfarb cannot be discarded as merely an undistinguished poorly reasoned historian (as some critics seem to want to suggest). On the contrary she's a redactionist of importance in the area of historical movements and measures. And this work proves it again.<br /><br />What Himmelfarb tries to do is reclaim the Enlightenment from what she sees as misguided French thinkers. It's difficult not to see her connections between a decline of religion, and the cultural outflowing resulting from aspects of the French Enlightenment.<br /><br />In contrast she presents the British Enlightenment as connected with social affections, based on a more solid moral foundation than that of the French with it's naked \\"ideology of reason\\" - a term I wish she would have explained in further detail.<br /><br />With that said, I found her claims regarding the French Enlightenment to be over-simplified. She claims, a preoccupation with reason as the primary fault of the French Enlightenment. However, I don't find this convincing in that the English movement was also very much focused on rationality, logic, and reason. My guess is her reaction here is too strong and too generalized.  Furthermore, does she miss the need for societies to be built on the ideal of rigorous intellectualism?<br /><br />On the whole, her work is both sophisticated and easy to get at, and certainly makes credible contributions to this field with her more conservative approach. Any honest evaluator cannot write this book off as a docile and unenthusiastic romanticizing of the events. - rather, it's a worthy read, worthy of evaluation.	2004-09-24

This seems to be a fair-minded and reasonable approach to the subject of Orthodoxy.<br /><br />Doesn't it also seem to follow that while various traditions each hold something worthy of conservation they may also hold to practices, which are not?  If so, I was wanting McLaren to distinguishing between the things that fall inside orthodoxy and those that fall outside.  This would have been helpful in knowing where freedom should be encouraged and where diversity of beliefs becomes a vice.<br /><br />That is, should individuals hold differing views on the deity of Jesus, etc? McLaren's open-door theology appears to be overly inclusive as it fails to distinguish those core truths, which apply to all peoples in all times and all places.<br /><br />How wide does McLaren cast the net of orthodoxy?  Consider page 198 where McLaren claims each of the `sola' phrases from the reformation to be `too narrow'....<br /><br />- 'Sola Scriptura' is too narrow. (The bible alone isn't sufficient as a means of spiritual authority?)<br />- 'Sola Christus' is too narrow. (Jesus Christ alone isn't sufficient for salvation?)<br />- 'Sola gratia' is too narrow. (We need more than God's grace?)<br />- 'Sola Deo Gloria' is too narrow. (There is something other than God's glory we should live for?)<br /><br />The book reveals where McLaren as an individual `feels comfortable'.  However, it doesn't convey why some doctrines are true and some are false.  How does a person know the difference?<br /><br />If a right knowing of the boundaries of orthodoxy is a requirement to godly living & loving others - then McLaren's book falls short.	2004-09-23

This book claims to be a common-sense approach to success in life.  And the author says it goes `Beyond Positive Thinking'.  However, let's face it.  This is the same stuff you've seen before.  Note: this book was first published in 1988 under the title: \\"The Advanced Formula for Total Success\\"  And it embraces the same positive visualization technique you've tried before.  If someone sees something revolutionary in the book I've missed, please post that.<br /><br />One thing the book emphasizes is aligning a person with the universe so that they become naturally attracted towards the things they want.  I've never found this to be a problem.  I want the things I want.  I don't always get the things I want, but I still want them.  My desires remain oriented towards what I want.<br /><br />Here's the thing I wish the book included.  I was hoping the book allowed the individual to evaluate the things he/she wants.  That is, I was waiting for a measure by which to determine what desires to pursue and which to turn away from.  There's no distinction made between good and bad emotions, desires, and wants.  I'm not suggesting all desires should be suppressed, but I'm suggesting it's important to differentiate between the good and the bad.<br /><br />In short, this book is 80's California-based self help material.

The extent of his research is boggling and I celebrate the totality of his indexing in this book. (I like books with good indexes)  His personal interviews combined with hours of digging through mundane documents of bureaucracy have certainly paid off.  If any government wanted to both compile and analyze the details Gertz did, how many committees and sub-committees would have had to be assembled?<br /><br />His documentation on China supplying weapons to al Qaeda after the September 11, 2001 is no less than maddening.  What have those weapons been used for?  Were they used by al Qaeda assisted terrorists in Beslan?<br /><br />Russia and France don't come out looking any better in their cooperation with Saddam Hussein after the 2003 Iraq war broke out.  Huh, no wonder they were comfortable with the UN status quo.<br /><br />Gertz absolutely shames the UN in their exploitation of the \\"oil for food\\" program.  Make sure you have a bottle of antacid handy before getting too deep into this - otherwise a person could end up burning a hole through their esophagus.<br /><br />His conclusions were a little simplistic and pretty obvious.  He suggests we need 1. good reliable intelligence 2. the ability to execute quickly on that information 3. cooperation from allies.<br /><br />Much of Gertz work suggests international alliances are to be pursued with great care.  Or, at a minimum, pursuing trusting relationships with some countries may be downright foolish.  Trust takes time to rebuild.  It's true in personal relationships.  It's true with international ones as well.	2004-09-08

In short, he makes this is an enjoyable read.<br /><br />Surowiecki argues that under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably intelligent, and are often smarter than the smartest people in them.  That's a summary of the book, as he claims large groups of people are smarter than an elite few.  It's a view, which easily supports capitalism and democracy.  And I believe that's because his overall premise and conclusions are correct.<br /><br />I've been thinking of some potential counter-examples.  For instance, why is it that the `blockbuster' films of summer are often some of the poorest pieces of entertainment?  Additionally, I can understand a few people buying junk food, but why do the masses consume it?  Furthermore, why do some of the worst politicians end up getting elected?<br /><br />The thing Surowiecki seemingly leaves out is the importance of having a `good' populous.  What I mean is, imagine a pirate ship filled with thieves and robbers who are `electing' a new captain.  Isn't it most likely that their choice will reflect their values (or lack of them)?  Isn't one essential ingredient for good choices that of a good means or standard by which to test options against in the decision making process?<br /><br />The ideal of cooperation, or having to work together despite our self-interest, is a moral ideal.  Likewise, mutual respect is not amoral.  These are requirements in a productive and coordinated society.  The question then becomes, how do individuals gain a right foundation allowing these essential, shared values?  I wish Surowieki had addressed this.  With that said, the book brings up a much needed discussion which will hopefully be carried into the public square.	2004-08-30

First of all Hugh Hewitt is a genuinely talented talk show host.  He's witty.  He can poke fun at himself.  He asks good questions.  With that said, I have some concerns with this book.  Let me explain.<br /><br />Hewitt recommends practical advice for winning elections in our determined epoch of cruel politics.  Many of his suggestions are spot on and should be headed.  However, the point I depart from Hewitt is on his seeming emphasis on elections not as a means, but as an end in themselves.  That is, he appears to desire to have conservatives in office merely to have conservatives in office.<br /><br />Let me get more specific.  Hewitt suggests that if Republicans want to win elections they must avoid controversial subjects like the environment, guns, and abortion.  (By the way, when was the last time you heard Hewitt mention any of these topics?) While this might make for savvy guidance for winning elections I believe it turns a blind eye to the opportunity to reform culture by being a cogent and persuasive voice in the public square on central issues.<br /><br />Yes, I'm aware of the answer.  After the elections are won there will be time to promote specific topics.  However, I don't often hear conservatives espousing conservative ideals either inside or outside of election races.  Maybe old habits die hard?  Maybe they're already looking towards the next election?  Why bring up something as controversial and devisive as abortion?<br /><br />If the true goal is a culture that reflects sound and moral values, but conservatives are mostly concerned with `retaining office' rather than fighting for just laws I believe the cultural slide with be alarmingly abrupt.  There is a tremendous didactic opportunity, which comes from being in office.  It's called the bully pulpit - and it requires resolve and courage to use it wisely and rightly.<br /><br />I think of one of the great Reagan anecdotes where the president was warned of the `political ramifications' of a decision he was about to make.  He responded by asking the advisor to only talk to him about what is right to do and not what is `politically expedient'.  Maybe that's a crude example of what I consider to be the ideal, but I suggest Hewitt has lost sight of this.ded by asking the advisor to only talk to him about what is right to do and not what is `politically expedient'.

First of all, I appreciate Dr. Wayne's gentle approach both in speaking and in writing.  He's a pursuasive man who displays great communication skills.  With that said, I had some questions and concerns about this book.  Let me explain.<br /><br />The Power of Intention is a semi-religious presentation that urges readers to connect with the 'source', which Dyer occasionally names 'god'. I found he describes this `source' to be the connecting link attaching every material thing to 'intent'.  Ok, that may seem a little ethereal, but that's where he takes this.<br /><br />Dyer writes much about divine love and intent.  As a result, my question becomes this...  If `love' exists who is the Lover?  If `intent' exists who is the Intender?  See,  The god Dyer sets up is a nebulous `source' divorced from personhood.  Why do I say that?  Because he claims you are as much god as God is.  If god is all and is in all, then how could an impersonal energy force be capable of such a thing as `love'?  I wish Dyer had addressed this.<br /><br />If a personal, creator God does exist Dyer presents an informal religion, which ends up curiously leaving Him out.  Or, at a minimum Dyer espouses a belief-system limiting and reducing God to a much more manageable deity.  There are no moral requirements with Dyer's god, and certainly there's no need to worship such a deity - or to seek that deity's will.<br /><br />I don't mean to sound harsh, but Dyer's god is the individual.  Your will is god's will.  Your desires are god's desires.  It's the same new age belief that you are god, and that you need to recognize that.  Which is really no god at all.  If a creator God exists then Dyer's god tries to unemploy Him.<br /><br />Dyer quotes Jung, 'One of the main functions of formalized religion is to protect people against a direct experience of God.'  I was thinking about this statement and how, if a personal/creator God does exist, and if that God is all-powerful and `totally pure' (and we are not) then we indeed would need something to protect us from God.  Attempting direct connection with the Creator of the universe via meditative union may not be wise.  In fact, it may be foolish.  As a result, a mediator may be what we need even more than meditation.  The question then becomes, who is the best mediator between God and humanity?ng to protect us from God.

There are certainly a number of items in Malkin's book, which combine to present a reasonable approach to this subject.  Likewise there are aspects of this book which give rise to concern.  Let me try to distinguish between both.<br /><br />First, I believe Malkin attempts a balance between civil liberties and national security. And, the end result will either outrage, enlighten, or radically change the way readers view profiling.  In short, this book is best for persons concerned about both historical truth and civil liberties alike.<br /><br />With that said, she argues those who take a purist's stand on Japanese internment forget that political forces could not see into the future. Theirs was an action based on solid intelligence, constitutional legality, and tough deliberation. (that's how she presents it and that's what she argues)<br /><br />I do agree with Malkin that there is no such thing as an \\"ideal option\\" in war. Nations do what they must in order to survive. However, I still don't believe it's possible to justify the use of atomic weapons which resulted in the deaths of thousands of non-combatants - as she seems to suggest.<br /><br />Yes, leaders cannot be idealists and yes, in a war setting they must take on some level of utilitarianism and pragmatism. However, that doesn't mean morals and common decency can be jettisoned in the name of expediency.<br /><br />Malkin's book also defends racial, ethnic, religious, and nationality profiling as effective defensive measures in today's War on Terror.  Ok, this is where I start to get spooked.  Consider this hypothetical - The `terrorists' are monotheistic, highly religious, pray daily, follow strict moral codes, and attend worship services weekly.  Does that sound like your average 'Southern Baptist'?  See, here's the thing I don't trust regarding governments -- that's their ability to adopt profiling regiments which carefully observe the more subtle nuances of people groups.  In short, the blanket has a tendency to grow and not shrink.  Will innocent people be detained and their civil rights abused?  Theirs no question.  The real question is, how much are we willing to tolerate?  Or, how much is necessary?<br /><br />Yes, Malkin is not advocating rounding up all Arabs or Muslims and tossing them into camps - And I do believe she brings a bracing dose of desperately needed common sense to the ongoing debate about the balance between civil liberties and national security.  However, I happen to be a person who is more afraid of governments than of terrorists.  As a result, I'm cautious about Malkin's conclusions.<br /><br />Is misguided guilt about the past continuing to hamper our ability to prevent future terrorist attacks?  Probably.  However, is there also a very real possibility of future administrations abusing this increasing power?  I believe so.innocent people be detained and their civil rights abused?  Theirs no question.

The thing she didn't expound upon is if any of those terrorist groups are radically and consistently living out the core tenants of their belief-system or if they are being disingenuous to their faith.  This would have gone a long ways in helping the reader understand differing terrorist motives and possible manipulation of their respective religions.  That is, are some people using their faith for their own personal ends as opposed to submitting to its truth-claims?<br />Certainly the author has done an enormous amount of first-hand research.  However, after interviewing extremist members of three religions around the world: Christians, Jews, and Muslims, Jessica Stern implies that each of these world religions is equally conducive to terrorism.  However, common sense, statistical analysis, and history prove otherwise.  Is that politically correct to say?  No, however, I wish she'd had the courage to acknowledge that basic truth.<br />Explaining the &quot;how&quot; therefore becomes as important as explaining the &quot;why,&quot; and the book carefully outlines the ways in which militant leaders of all denominations find recruits among the disenfranchised.  It's the phrase `all denominations' that hints at Stern's wide blanket toss.  Is she suggesting everyone's the same and all beliefs are equally at fault?  It appears so.  And if so, that's academically irresponsible and simply doesn't fit the facts.<br />Stern suggests the most effective counterstrategy to terrorism is thus not violence but nonviolent techniques such as psychological counter-warfare and the reaffirmation of our own values.  However, it's that last part that raises questions.  We are to reaffirm our own values?  Wait, I thought earlier she suggest that `all denominations' are to be blamed for the rise in terrorism.  How is it that we should re-affirm our own beliefs?  If she were to be logically consistent is seems she should suggest all metaphysical beliefs be abandoned.<br />Stern compares Muslim suicide bombers with early Christian martyrs.  The obvious thing she doesn't point out is the Christian martyrs were put to death (murdered) for their faith - while suicide bombers put others to death (murder) for their faith.  It seems she would have been best served sticking with the comparison between abortion clinic bombers and suicide bombers.<br />Some of Stern's research is at best questionable.  On page 26 she quotes a person who's suppose to be an authority on Christianity and in one paragraph the person makes three significant mistakes.  I'll conclude with this statement from page 95.  \\"Evangelical Christians and Messianic Jews have developed a cooperative relationship, based on their common belief that rebuilding the Temple will facilitate the process of redemption...\\" At best this statement is sloppy and at worst it's intentionally misleading.  The vast majority of both Evangelical Christians and Messianic Jews do not believe this.  Yes, there is a small faction, which is more accurately defined as dispensational Christianity who might believe this - but this would represent a very small number of people.<br />In short, I'm disappointed with the lack of distinctions in the book - and expect more from an author of her experience and influence.tions' are to be blamed for the rise in terrorism.

As other reviewers noted the claims of this text lead to a radical reinterpretation of Jesus' teaching.  For instance, the 'Gospel of Mary' rejects Christ's suffering and death as the path to eternal life.  This is the key, central, and foundational teaching of the Christian gospel.  Jesus being the 'Lamb who takes away the sins of the world' is the essence of the gospel.  To deny this is to purport something different that Christianity and in the case of the 'Gospel of Mary' it was an attempt to usurp Christianity with Gnosticism.  I wish King had pointed this out.<br />King argues that this Gnostic gospel of Mary prefers 'inner spiritual knowledge' as oppose to the claims of Jesus - His claims that he is the way, truth, life, and light.  As a result, this other gospel contradicts Jesus' teachings about himself as it separates truth from his very person.  In fact, the text King examines claims that Mary alone was imparted esoteric teachings.  This is, of course, Gnostic teaching, which claims elite 'special knowledge' or 'secret teachings'.  However, this is far different from what is found in the synoptic gospels where Jesus' teaching is always about himself with no secret knowledge outside of his person.  King doesn't seem to make this point.<br />After evaluating King's book I wonder why it was that Gnosticism dried up and blew away while Christianity thrived.  I have to believe it has to do with Jesus being the 'good news' for common people, common sinners, common weary men and women.  This appeals to people far more than a 'secret society'.  People want a person to know, a person who loves them, and a person who forgives them.  Jesus offered that in the first century and still does today.ered that in the first century and still does today.	2003-11-20

Eldridge suggests there is 'glory' hidden in each Christian's heart, and the goal is to capture and maintain a sense of liberation through a realization of human glory.<br /><br />As in his other books, John Eldridge conveys some great stories.  Here he relates emotionally engaging accounts from The Perfect Storm, The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings, The Wizard of Oz.  However, the other parts of the book (theology and conclusions) have prompted me to rate this book at only two stars.  Let me tell you why.<br /><br />Eldridge's book ultimately focuses on the realization of human glory.  I suggest this stands in stark contrast to the New Testament.  However, before I critique his conclusion, let me first convey his approach.<br /><br />Here is a summary of the book:<br />1. God wants us to be happy. (Starting and presumed premise)<br />2. However, we are not always happy. (Provides real-life examples)<br />3. Therefore, we are either blowing it or God is. (Eldridge's words)<br />4. The fault cannot be God's therefore it must be ours. (Assumed conclusion)<br />5. God's glory is 'man fully alive'. (Read 'fully alive' as 'fully happy')<br />6. 'God's happiness and my happiness are tied together'. (A direct quote from the book)<br />7. Therefore, 'God's committed to my happiness'. (Another quote)<br />8. In fact, 'my happiness is the purpose of Christianity'. (An abbreviated quote)<br />9. Final conclusion: I need to live for my happines.(Summary)<br /><br />I'm not pulling your leg.  This is directly from the first chapter!  I found this first chapter to be the substance of the book with the rest of the book becoming footnotes to this primary chapter.<br /><br />Ok, the outline above stands in direct contrast to the words of Jesus, Peter, Paul, John, James, and ultimately - God the Father.<br /><br />Here's a summary of the New Testament:<br />1. God wants us to be holy (Matt. 5:48)<br />2. Because of this God is far more concerned with our character than He is with our comfort/happiness. (Romans 5:3-5!)<br />3. This is because our happiness is fleeting and our character remains for eternity. (James 4:14)<br />4. We will have trials, troubles, and tribulation in this world. (Acts 5:41)<br />5. Take heart, for God has over-come the world through Jesus. (John 16:33)<br />6. Jesus will be your source of strength and peace through this difficult life. (John 15)<br />7. Live for Him.  He is the source of real joy despite life-circumstances. (Luke 9:23&24)<br /><br />As a result, I'm disappointed in the book - not because I didn't 'like' it, but because I'm convinced it misrepresents scripture - including Jesus' person and work.

When reading the book I often thought of the adage, \\"In essentials unity, in non-essentials liberty, and in all things charity.\\"  And then questions would come to mind: What are the distinctions between essentials and non-essentials?  Are there some essentials in Christianity, which would be disastrous to change?  When is dogma a virtue?  These are foundational questions, which I wish McLaren had at least attempted to answer.  Not all change is good, and he seems to miss this self-evident point.  It would have substantially bettered the book had he provided some qualifiers that would assist in determining change resulting in progression vs. change resulting in regression.<br />--One of the primary things that concerns me with this book is how little value is placed on truth from a theological perspective.  Repeatedly McLaren downplays the importance of theology and the intellectual Christian life.  He claims the `wars' between liberals and conservatives are `over', and that Christians need to stop defending those fronts.  However, this would be to abandon essential issues such as ........what constitutes salvation, the nature of God, biblical inerrancy, and  biblical compatibility with science.  These continue to be very real issues, and the debate is now more relevant than ever.  To give up now would be tragic.  The liberals and conservatives tackle these issues by asking the simple question `Are the claims true?' and `Is the Bible accurate?'  Now `A New Kind of Christian' comes out and declares, \\"It doesn't matter if they're true or not, it's irrelevant, we need to progress and change - let's move on, and leave all of this behind.\\"  Do you see how subtle and dangerous this approach is?<br />--McLaren degrades those who believe in absolute truth, and suggests those who believe `knowledge is power' are wrong.  He has a pragmatic view of truth, declaring something is true if it `works'.  However, he then fails to define how someone can know if something `works' or not.  He makes very general statements about changing things in the church until they `work'.  What does that mean?  .... Until more people show up?.... Until people `feel' they `like' church `more'?  His meaning is very vague.<br />--Here's the inconstant part, the author periodically quotes passages from the Nicene Creed, or from Paul's words to Timothy, or from the Gospels.  However, he doesn't present these words as being `true' or not because he doesn't see the value in defending their truthfulness.  He simply presents them as words that have `helped' him or that he thinks are `beautiful phrases' or that he `agrees with'.  This is a very slippery view because it is a position that must equally value all things that all people find useful and beautiful.  Scripture is no longer exclusive, truth is no longer absolute, Christianity is no longer the only way.  There is value in all religions, and all wise writings, the scope of religion transcends all human experience.  Do you see how we carefully walks away from Christianity into general `Spirituality'?<br />--Unfortunately, this book is more dangerous that the writings of someone like John Shelby Spong because it is so much more covert and subtle.  Evangelicals are reading this book, and I'm guessing some of them have a difficult time discerning where the author departs from orthodox Christianity.  If you read this book, I would suggest you test every word and phrase as you read it with a critical eye - seek do divide truth from error, right from wrong, light from darkness, and the good from the bad.He has a pragmatic view of truth, declaring something is true if it `works'.

US	39554092	R1ZO1SP531EZ8R	0375501568	81872394	Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas	Books	2	13	20	N	N	A bold book that tries the impossible....	Pagals' writing makes for a well-researched and scholarly book. However, I believe her conclusions to be careless, in that they are simply not fair to the original documents.<br />1. She points out, correctly, that Christianity did have great initial diversity - as compared to other religions, which often consisted of a single social or racial group. In contrast, Christianity embraced women, slaves, Jews, Gentiles, Greeks, Romans, tax collectors, fisherman, etc. The point she doesn't make is that this continues today. The core tenants of Christianity are embracing of all people - although not of all ideas. I wish she would have made this important distinction.<br />2. The other historical observation she makes is that Christianity narrowed to include only certain scriptural texts as authoritative. This is accurate. (Although her assumption is that a large amount of Christians embraced other 'Gnostic' texts - a claim boasting little evidence.) The council of Nicea certainly did this. If a canon was never arrived at some point, then which writings would be seen as authoritative and which would not? If boundaries were never set, then I suppose a person may argue today that the Koran should be seen as a Christian text? (In fact, that might be the next hot-seller!)<br />3. The substance of her book consists of a conflict she sets up between the books of John and Thomas. She claims that Thomas offered readers a message of 'spiritual enlightenment', instead of promoting Jesus as an exclusive means to God, and the only 'light of the world'. I'm still not sure why she sees Thomas as a message of 'spiritual enlightenment', and apparently not John. (Maybe the individual becomes their own savior instead of needing to turn to Christ?) Furthermore, I don't understand her lament that 'only one was chosen'. She wants them both to be authoritative, and yet they contradict each other regarding truth-claims? Perhaps in Pagals' world truth doesn't seem to pose a problem. However, in the realm of logic, if two statements contradict each other, then only one can be true. The early Christians believed truth existed, and were therefore forced abandon the book of Thomas since it not only doesn't fit with John, but it contradicts much of the rest of the NT - particularly many of Jesus' statements about Himself.<br />4. Pagals points out that the book of Thomas teaches individuals that \\"there is a light within each person, and it lights up the whole universe. If it does not shine, there is darkness.\\" This is an incredible contrast to John's teaching that Jesus is the light of the world and that His followers reflect Jesus' light - He is the source.<br />5. Pagels suggests that Thomas be 'recovered' as a way of embracing the 'glorious diversity of religious tradition'? The first type of diversity mentioned earlier in the book is one of Christianity embracing numerous racial, social, and economic backgrounds. However, what she promotes now is a very different form of 'diversity'. Pagals now suggests contradictory truth-claims be accepted in the name of 'diversity'. In short, she suggests the book of Thomas be promoted at the expense of truth. This is a very bold claim. In fact, it's so bold that I wonder why she doesn't go further and suggest all Gnostic teachings be seen as canonical. In fact, what would make her stop there? Here's the thing, Pagals doesn't want to reform Christianity, she wants it to become Gnostic.<br />6. She claims religion is not an assent to a set of beliefs, but a fabric of teachings that connect us with 'the divine'. If that's her belief, then is that a belief she wants her readers to believe in contradiction to the NT? Is she promoting this belief despite the exclusive claims of Christ that He is the Way, Truth, and Life?<br />7. Reformation is a calling back to original beliefs. Pagals tries so desperately to claim that she is reforming Christianity back to its core tenants - or at least to something 'better'. However, this isa significant stretch and she fails leap over the gap. Gnostic beliefs existed independently of Christianity; and still do. Christianity never was Gnostic. The two are oil and water. Her book is a valiant and 'scholarly' effort, but it falls significantly short. Again, it's the peskiness of truth that proves Pagals' principal foe.a significant stretch and she fails leap over the gap. Gnostic beliefs existed independently of Christianity; and still do.

His use of the English language is beautiful, making this book a pleasure to read.  However, I have some very real concerns with this book. When Peter Jennings says this book, \\"...is important for all Americans and those who would make American policy\\" I have reason for concern.  Actually, there are very specific reasons why I'm troubled by this book.  Let me tell you why.<br />1. Zakaria is correct; today we judge the value of every idea, institution, and individual by one test: is it popular?  Leaders who are daily blown by winds of change cannot focus on long-term objectives.  However, leaders who bend to whimsical political pressure are not practicing `democracy' - nobody's casting votes here - they're simply demonstrating how little backbone they have.<br />2. I do agree with Zakaria that democracy is not `inherently' good.  I disagree with him on why this is.  Democracy is very similar to freedom, and freedom itself is not `inherently' good.  Why?...because freedom can be used for both good and evil.  Free will creates an opportunity to choose that which is not good.  Democracy does that same thing.  A person can vote for a good leader, or a person can vote for a bad leader - the institution of democracy makes no distinction.<br />3. Zakaria believes that democracy `needs strong limits' to function properly.  No, I would suggest that democracy `needs good people' to function properly.  See, this is an important difference - and it's not a very politically correct statement.  However, a democracy of thieves and robbers will result in leaders and laws that reflect the values of criminals.  I believe that's self-evident.<br />4. Zakaria brings up the example of 1933 Germany electing the Nazis to power.  Instead of denouncing the voter's inability to wisely discern, Zakaria blames democracy itself.  He joins the ranks of the `blame democracy first crowd'.  Regarding 1933 Germany, democracy was merely the tool.  The tool was not broken - it's the user!  This was a prime case of `user error'.<br />5. Here's the fundamental problem with Zakaria's book.  Instead of starting at the grass-roots and explaining the essential importance of educating people in both knowledge and morality, Zakaria questions if democracy is the best governmental option.  This is a critical mistake.<br />6. I'm not saying the democracy will work at any time at any place.  I'm not naïve about that.  However, I am willing to say why it won't work at any time and any place, and the answer has nothing to do with democracy and everything to do with a people group's values.  Not all values are equal.  Not all values are good.  Not all values are equally conducive to democracy.<br />7. Alexis de Tocqueville said, \\"America is great because she is good, and if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.\\"  This could be said about any democracy, anywhere in the world.  A democracy devoid or morals is chaos.  I wish Zakaria recognized this and encouraged a means for a better - aka `good' populous - rather than deriding democracy itself.<br />8. We do not live in a perfect world, and there are no perfect forms of government.  Winston Churchill's famous quote is good to remember,  \\"Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.\\"  It is the least of all evils.  Yes, there is a downside to democracy, but there is nothing better. Zakaria's push for an elitist government - a country run by the few - is not only a bad option, it is a disastrous one that fails to consider the nature of the human condition.tool was not broken - it's the user!

First of all, I'd like to say how easy this book is to read.  With all of the dialog it flows well, and reads almost like fiction.  Weiss is certainly a polished writer and does a good job at adding interesting details. However, with that said, I was disappointed with the book.  Here is why...<br />I do not question Dr. Weiss or Catherine's experience.  I don't think she was making any of it up.  What I do take exception with is Weiss's interpretation of the accounts.  He believes that Catherine was not only recounting past lives, but that she was being spoken to by `spirit masters'.  Instead of building a strong case for why he believes this to be true, he seems to just accept is as a brute fact and does not question his interpretation.  Even if he is correct, his conclusion (that we should believe their messages) doesn't necessarily follow.<br />Weiss claims that the messages are coming from highly evolved spirit entities.  While the book portrays them as being intelligent, this does not mean their messages are true.  I know plenty of intelligent people who I would never trust and whose messages would be dangerous to follow.  The world we live in contains both good and evil people.  How do we know for certain that this is not the case for the spirit world?  I mean, is it possible that the spirit masters are not telling the truth?<br />Here's the thing that concerns me.  Catherine was experiencing panic attacks, anxiety, and fears prior to meeting with Weiss.  Were these emotional states caused by the spirit masters?  Where they `haunting' her and tormenting her?  If so, why should they be trusted?<br />Weiss said that he believed the messages by way of `intuition' and he goes on to stat the he `just knew it in his bones'.  Then he closes the final chapter by saying that he thinks the spirit masters are still influencing his intuition.  So, the spirit masters influenced his intuition, but he knew they were right by way of his intuition?  This is a case of pure circular reasoning.<br />Amazingly the spirit masters promote classic new age teaching - we are not to judge others, we are beyond space and time, we can become god-like, we will gradual merge with God... etc.  I wonder if Weiss had been an orthodox Jew if the masters would have declared classic Jewish doctrine?rcular reasoning.  <br />Amazingly the spirit masters promote classic new age teaching - we are not to judge others, we are beyond space and time, we can become god-like, we will gradual merge with God... etc.  I wonder if Weiss had been an orthodox Jew if the masters would have declared classic Jewish doctrine?	2003-02-16

I had to translate her statements because they were often heavy-handed and rarely polite.  She seemed to be trying to achieve an emotional response from her readers rather than an intellectual one.  It's a WWF response that avoids subtlety.<br />2. Huffington's tactics remind me of the outraged man-hater who shouts, \\"All men are pigs!\\"  However, in this book she shouts, \\"All corporate type are money grubbing, greedy swine!\\".  This broad-brushed approach makes for tedious reading.  Yes, she did a boat-load of research for the book, and I appreciate that, but it doesn't offset the acid-spitting outrage that she displays.  She's angry.  Ok, there's nothing wrong with being angry and I will admit that corporate scandal is something worthy of being angry over.  However, at times I wanted to ask her to \\"calm down...count to ten...take a deep breath.... Relax, OK, now tell me what's wrong AND more importantly, how we should fix it.\\"<br />3. This leads to my next point... because Huffington complains throughout the book, there is little space devoted to constructive suggestions.  That is, she offers virtually no solutions.  The only thing she mentions which could be interpreted as a solution is her request that more people participate in democracy - that is, more people need to get out and vote.  That's all she really offers in the book from a positive standpoint.  She doesn't suggest what laws would be good to pass, or what laws would be good to get rid of, or how strong moral laws are to be created.<br />4. Now, regarding capitalism as a whole, it would have been helpful if she spent a chapter explaining the positives and negatives of \\"free markets\\" compared to markets that are government owned and government funded.  This would have provided some serious credibility and more of a scholarly approach.<br />All of this analysis goes to say that I was sorely disappointed in the book.d.

This is the real and important question this book attempts to discuss on a religous, scientific, and philosophical basis. Goleman's account is surprisingly easy to read, and likewise the concepts are readily understandable. However, I was ultimately disappointed in the book. Here is why...<br />Regarding destructive emotions, there is very little in the book, which refers to 'root causes' of those emotions. Rather there is an emphasis on controlling emotions. This approach attempts to deal with symptoms via practices intended to annihilate desire/craving (the dharma practice) The apparent contradiction is this -- parental love, pleasure seeking, and self-defense are all part of our emotional make up. Therefore, some emotions are good and some are bad. (few would disagree with this.) However, the dharma practice is a means of decreasing emotional desire in its entirety.<br />If a distinction is to be made between the 'good' emotions and the 'bad' emotions then a value judgment is required. So, the question which never gets answered in the book is 'Within the Buddhist tradition what is the framework for making moral distinctions?' Ok, with that said, the most interesting part of the book is when Owen Flanagan (Ph.D., Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Human Interaction Laboratory at the University of California at San Francisco Medical School) discusses the differences between virtue ethics, utilitarian ethics, and Kantian ethics - in an attempt to show that some sort of value judgment needs to be made between emotions. (pages 63-68) Unfortunately, much of his discussion is never adequately responded to by anyone in attendance, including the Dalai Lama.<br />The other key point, which never gets answered, is regarding the Buddhist term, which roughly translates, 'destructive emotions'. The term is, 'Klesha' also translated 'mental affliction'. Now, this is where it gets interesting. Is this 'mental affliction' a cause or a result? Does anxiety arise out of negative behavior or does anxiety cause negative behavior. If it is negative behavior that causes destructive emotions then instead of simply ignoring those emotions it seems best for a person to change the behavior that's causing the emotions. Unfortunately, this common sense answer isn't offered in the book.<br />In short, a number of good and challenging points were asked of the Dalai Lama, but his answers to these questions were weak and somewhat evasive. Instead of pressing for a more adequate answer, those in attendance would simply go on to the next point. Part of a good dialog is asking honest questions and waiting for an honest answer. While there are good questions in the book, I didn't find satisfying answers to those questions. In fact, it doesn't seem that many of the points can be addressed w/in the Buddhist framework. That's disappointing.a cause or a result? Does anxiety arise out of negative behavior or does anxiety cause negative behavior.

Mel Levine's first book `A Mind at a Time' succeeded in taking a common sense approach to the important subject of learning types.  This book does the same thing, but focuses on one specific functional challenge - that of a lack of productivity.<br /><br />1. Levine continues to assert that different learning styles require different teaching strategies.  As a result, he does not believe that any child is inherently lazy.  While this is likely true for young children, it does not seem to be necessarily the case for adolescents or adults. (Levine would disagree)  That is, laziness can be learned and even chosen later in life.  In fact, I often find myself choosing the way of the sloth - to my own frustration and embarrassment.<br />2. Levine identifies a number of causes of low performance.  Some of these are internal like organizational problems, poor ability to verbally express, or poor writing skills.  However, these types of things don't seem to be `causes' as much as they do `results' or `symptoms'.  He does go on to briefly discuss external factors like socioeconomic background, family life, and negative role models.  Now these seem to be more root-causes - however, he doesn't spend much time on these, which I found to be disappointing.<br />3. The thing that I do like about Levine is that he develops suggestions for what parents can do to encourage productive output in children.  Additionally, he provides objective means for identifying if the problem is internal or environmental.  I happen to believe the vast majority of people fall into the latter category - at least as the initial influence.  However, it seems laziness becomes a choice as well.  So, there's a bit of controversy here - which makes the book interesting and relevant.<br />4. Lastly, Levine doesn't leave the reader in an ethereal and contemplative world, but brings problem solving down to a real-life level by providing worksheets, which assist children in planning stories and reports - to get their minds working.<br />5. It seems it's so necessary to start fostering creativity, activity, and expression at a young age.  Additionally, abundant parental praise related to accomplishments is also very needed.  In short, this is a good book, however it would have been helpful if Levine had focused more in the area of relationships.their minds working. <br />5.

They are pictures of interesting people who struggle with real issues.  These stories are entertaining and well written.  With that said, I was disappointed with the suggestions (or lack there of) found in the rest of the book.<br />Bronson writes that, \\"We all have passions if we choose to see them,\\".  This is certainly true.  However, it would seem a book with this title would provide a means by which a person can differentiate their passions.  What I mean is, it's impossible to follow all of our passion, and neither doest it seem that we `should' follow all of our passions.  I know it would be a major mistake for me to follow some of my passions.  So, how can a person know which passions to follow?  I wish Bronson had spent some time on this instead of merely pointing out that passions exist in all of us - by this he almost takes an `it's all good' attitude.<br />Bronson writes about `callings', but doesn't explore where these callings come from.  Additionally, he strangely writes about self-acceptance.  He doesn't seem to acknowledge that there are some things about ourselves that we should accept and others that we shouldn't.  This would be essential in a book like this.  Furthermore, he refers to moral guilt as always being negative.  He misses the fact that moral guilt is sometimes very good and inhibits us from doing what we should not do.<br />Lastly this book comes across as promoting an essentially self-centered life.  You find your dream, and then you go get it for you so that you will be happy.  This approach short sells the importance of others, and doing things for other people.  That is, altruism can be an incredible source of peace and satisfaction.  However, Bronson feeds the \\"me-first\\" message that is so strong in our culture today.<br />In short, this book deals with a very important and much needed subject.  Unfortunately, the conclusions presented here leave much to be desired.  If you want to read his 'bottom line' check out page 362 - the first full paragraph.be desired.

David Hanson provides great historical anecdotes throughout this book.  Writing in a fresh and compelling way, he takes on the assertions promoted by elite academics that all cultures are morally equal.  The claim that there are no values, which are better or worse for a society to adopt, is directly addressed in this book.  Hanson provides a much needed and refreshing voice in the marketplace of ideas.<br />He does a remarkable job of taking on the `blame America first crowd'.  For instance, on numerous occasions I've heard the question, \\"Why do they hate America so much?\\"  This question is often coupled with an underlying belief that the democratic and free world bares blame for being the target of terrorism.  However, this seems to be much like accusing a female victim of assault of wearing clothes that are too attractive. Do innocent people deserve to die because they live in a country that is too free, too capitalistic, and too democratic?<br />Yes, Hanson's writing is opinionated, but I'd prefer reading a book where the author is assertive and clear on the ideas being expressed.  Unfortunately, most of what is written on the events of 9/11 is descriptive, but lacks any prescription.  Hanson does both.<br />In short, Hanson shows how an adequate and right response to terrorism can and will leave the world a better place.  His historical examples and clear thinking result in an important book on a difficult topic.	2003-01-02

First of all, from a purely pragmatic standpoint, few can deny that Rudolph Giuliani is a results oriented leader. Having inherited a city ravaged by crime and internally broken, he truly transformed one of the greatest cities on Earth. This book provides numerous accounts which show he is a hands-on manager who is willing to provide a strong response to any problem. Additionally, he is one of the most aggressive leaders in the United States -- behind that smile is one tough person.<br />Giuliani tells of how ideas are important and it seems he is a man who likes to think. That's a trait which is much needed in leadership today.<br />He writes of the essential element which all great leaders must have, which is the possesion of strong beliefs. However, I was dissapointed that he wasn't candid in telling how he personally develops his 'strong beliefs'. Yes, he talks of family, but families can sometimes transfer 'good beliefs' and sometimes they can transfer 'bad beliefs'. History tells of great leaders who led their countries to ruin -- morally, economically, and militarily. I wish Giuliani had made the distinction between great 'good' leaders and great 'bad' leaders and explained the difference -- including how he personally tests and measures against principles to ensure decision are made rightly.<br /><br />Giuliani's devotion and love of his work shines brightly throughout the book. He clearly has a love and passion for New York and its poeple. This book is a gift and a great read, by a proven leader.	2003-01-01

First of all this book is somewhat of a ramble. Ambrose jumps from one subject to the next and interweaves personal narrative throughout. His not shying from letting his opinion be known makes 'To America' so appealing.<br />Stephen Ambrose certainly had a gift. It was the gift of story telling. Perhaps more accurate description would be story \\"re-telling\\". That is, he was a superior listener who had a knack for asking the right questions. In my opinion his greatest books were the ones were he was able to interview eyewitnesses to the accounts - it is here that he shined the brightest.<br />Ambrose lets it be known that he has is a proud American. His pride is not arrogance, but is a contentment in the ideals which make America great. (work ethic, freedom, power to the people, honesty, justice...) However, he is also a writer who is quick to point out flaws as well. This type of personal judgment is refreshing in contrast to writers who stay far from their subjects - ending is writing that is dry and detached.<br />Ambrose's love of history and his passion for stories will be sorely missed and this book reminds us of why that is true.	2002-12-31

However, with that said, I believe he falls short of his intention. That's because it's not possible to get an 'ought' from an 'is'.  In other words, evolution is an explanation of what is, what was, and what may be to come, but it does not step into the realm of what should be (morality).  In fact, evolution cannot provide ethical principles which are transcendant of the natural realm.<br />A) Wilson argues that religion is evolution at work. This is a difficult claim to defend. For one thing Wilson states that, \\"Thinking of a religious group as like an organism encourages us to look for adaptive complexity.... Mechanisms are required that are often awesome in their sophistication.\\" However, there are numerous counter-examples, which show that many religious ideals have not adapted/changed, but have stood stone still through the centuries. Judaism is full of examples. Additionally, the Dead Sea Scrolls are a prime example.<br />B) Wilson sees religion as a complex organism with \\"biological\\" functions. He goes on to claim that if society is an organism we can then think of morality and religion as biologically and culturally evolved adaptations. If this is true, then there is no ultimate truth (right or wrong) regarding morality or religion. The current versions are simply that, current versions. Perhaps one unintended consequence of viewing morality in this light is that rape/murder/molestation may or may not be 'wrong' in future generations. Wilson's hypothesis does away with any moral principles and replaces them with the 'in' or fashionable ethic of the day. Society is left with no means of determining 'progress' since all change must be equally 'good' as there is nothing outside the system by which to measure against. That's a tough position to consistently live out.<br /><br />C) Wilson argues that religious belief and other symbolic systems are closely connected to reality in that they are a powerful force in motivating adaptive behaviors. However, this does not necessarily disconnect religion/theism from a right correspondence with a supernatural agent as a defining principle. Just because religion can be a powerful motivating force does not mean that the religion is not true.<br />D) Wilson posits human religious groups are adaptive organisms wherein processes like 1. group selection, 2. evolutionary pressures, and 3. moral systems come into play. Moral systems? Where do such moral systems come from? It seems Wilson evokes morality as a brute fact, but doesn't explain where morality originates. Furthermore, Wilson never addresses where the system of evolution itself comes from - a systems, which is highly organized, structured, and very productive.<br />In short, Wilson makes numerous assumptions, which are not adequately defended on a rudimentary/grass-roots level. His claims are sweeping, but when evaluated they appear to be rather unhinged.other symbolic systems are closely connected to reality in that they are a powerful force in motivating adaptive behaviors.

Additionally, he has an intense and admirable passion for this subject and writes an engaging book that ends up being part history, part travel literature, and part theology.<br />-However Feiler seems to stretch at times in making his case that Abraham `unites' the three religions of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity.  On the contrary, Abraham is more a point of contention than one of unity.  I wish Feiler had made the statement that all three positions on Abraham cannot be equally true since they often directly contradict each other.  A worthy goal is always to divide truth from error in order to understand which position, if any, is accurate.  Instead of taking this path, Feiler seems to desire peace at the expense of truth as he places religious harmony higher than a right understanding of theology.<br />-Feiler is correct that the most mesmerizing story of Abraham's life--his offering a son to God--plays a pivotal role in the holiest week of the Christian year, at Easter.  This is surely the case as Christianity sees Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac as a foreshadowing of the substitutionary atonement of Jesus.  However, this is a radically different interpretation of the event from either Judaism or Islam.<br />-Feiler states that Abraham, is a character who has shape-shifted over the millennia to the extent that the religions don't even agree on which son he tried to kill.  This is true, and the interpretation may have shape-shifted, but that does not mean the scriptural documents were changed.  That is, with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the claim that documents had been changed in order to fit with dogma, has little foundation.<br />-Feiler claims that Abraham is a type of metaphor and that this historically elusive man embodies three religions.  That's a difficult claim to back up.  Abraham `embodies' all three religions?  Certainly Christian scholars would not make that claim.  They would claim that only Jesus would fit this role.  Abraham was the one to whom the promise was made and Jesus was the fulfillment of that promise.  Abraham's role would be significantly secondary.<br />-Feiler concludes with a passionate and prayerful argument for peace between faiths.  This is a valiant attempt and his motives are surely good.  However, it would have been refreshing if he would have explained that when two people theologically disagree with each other that does not mean that they necessarily hate each other.  The existence of truth means that at least one party is wrong, but that does not mean that the parties cannot respect each other as people, even though they may not respect all theological positions. Grace, peace, and love can and do exist side by side with truth - and if truth exists, so does error.  One party being `wrong' is part of the package and it is the reality.  I wish Feiler's final sentence had been, \\"Call your brother wrong and love him with those words.\\"ions?  Certainly Christian scholars would not make that claim.

The Lee's book re-packages the basic teachings of Eastern Mysticism and conveys them to a modern audience. For instance the authors write about a mass spiritual awakening in which humankind finally comprehends the truth -- that \\"we are all one.\\" This idea of monism has been around for ...well, a long time. In short, there is very little that is 'new' in the Lee's book.<br />1. The author refer to an energy called \\"Ki\\" which they claim is the natural bridge that connects body, mind, and spirit, and is the perfect tool for allowing people to feel and understand the universe's most profound truth. That 'truth' is the idea that everything is one. This they state is the thing, which allows humanity to go beyond current problems into a higher spiritual plane.<br />2. And it's here that the ideas stumble. Are you having family problems? Are you having work problems? Are you having health problems? The Lee's claim that you are not. You are rather experiencing an illusion. You aren't seeing things correctly. Everything is one. It's all the same. Good and bad circumstances don't exist - just circumstances.<br />3. See, the book tries to get people to go beyond the categories of ethics. You can't call rape or murder 'bad', because everything is one. The good is the bad and the bad is the good. If everyone would just understand that, then this world would be a better place.<br />4. However, this isn't ultimately a very satisfying answer. In fact, it's an answer that asks the person to ignore what they know to be true in their heart; that evil is real, the good is real. The Lee's ask their readers to pretend that all is one and to not 'solve' problems, but to see them as not problems at all. This is escapism - It's running from the problem instead of facing it.<br />5. The Lees ask why this most simple and important truth gone unheeded. For one, it's a very difficult world to live in. It's hard to believe that justice, mercy, hope, love, and goodness and all illusory.<br />6. The authors sate that the world is in political, religious, economic, and ecological crises of our own making. We need a mass spiritual awakening, in which billions truly realize that we are One. This would transform our world: children wouldn't starve, women wouldn't be brutalized, and young men wouldn't die in battle. I can't agree with their conclusion. People would still starve, and women would still be brutalized, and people would still die in battle, but nobody would care. Why? Because it's all good, because it's all one.<br />7. The Lees claim that the purpose of life is really no big deal, although people have generally viewed the question, \\"Why am I here?\\" as the ultimate in self-exploration. This is true. If someone truly believes all is one, then my life is no more significant than the lives of the bugs on the bumper of my car. The authors teach that we are here on earth in such and such shape, form, and mind to strive for the completion of our spiritual selves, not only as individuals but as the whole. That 'completion' is a recognition that all is one. We are a drop in the bucket. Far from offering hope, this offers hopelessness, and asks that we accept that and come to terms with it.>6.

The art and science of discernment is the skill of being able to separate each, and in this book that is not an easy task.<br />1. On one hand Williamson says that \\"every person in line is someone we can bless.\\" She tells of how we are confronted with countless opportunities each day to effect the lives of others in a positive way. This is surely true. However, she is less clear on why we should place other people's interests ahead of our own. She seems to suggest that it is a matter of karma. That is, we do it to get when we give. This is subtly different from a motivation which solely desires to worship God through loving others.<br />2. Another concern with the book is Williamson's emphasis on 'mystical union'. Mysticism as a closeness with God and a practice of the presence of God seems a worthy goal. However, 'union' with God is an entirely different goal. If God is holy, just, eternal, and the transcendent Creator, then attempting to become one with God seems terribly foolish. However, if God is not personal, but is merely a 'force' or 'energy', then perhaps she is right.  So, the outcome depends directly on the nature of God, which is a topic she doesn't pursue, nor does she describe her theological view.  Trying to be one with God reminds me of the serpant who whispered, 'eat, and you will be like God'.<br />3. Williamson does a great job of addressing the problem of overscheduling and the distractions of pop-culture, and media. If God did create the universe then it does makes sense that God is to be found in the common and everyday things. That is, if God's fingerprints are on creation, then through this general revelation we can gain some understanding of God's nature. In turn we can reflect back to God praise, and blessing for the wonders of creation. This comes in the form of daily observation -- for instance, while commuting to work, or while doing the dishes. (I think of Brother Lawrence's book, 'Practicing the Presence of God)<br />4. I do question Williamson's monistic claim that everything connects to everything. She doesn't seem to leave room for 'good' to be distinct and separate from 'evil'. That is, she seems to blend everything in life, instead of finding what is good and praising it, and finding what is evil and denouncing it. Her claim seems to be '...it's all good'....... but is it? Isn't it good to call famine, rape, and sickness for what they are(evil), and not call them 'good'? Yes, good can come out of each, but they themselves are not good. Human suffering is not good.<br />5. In short, Williamson's insistence on a sort of magical oneness with all things leaves much to be desired. However, her understanding of finding the sacred in the ordinary is much needed -- and yet there is a big difference between understanding the ordinary as pointing to the divine, vs. seeing the ordinary as divine.  It seems Williamson falls into this later catagory.Brother Lawrence's book, 'Practicing the Presence of God)<br />4. I do question Williamson's monistic claim that everything connects to everything.

However, I was also disappointed in this book of theirs.<br />The Gores write about how the 'family' is changing, but they don't really define what `family' is.  In other words, what is essential to 'family' which cannot change?  What is necessary?  Are college  roommates 'family'?  Are co-workers 'family'?  Are people who ride the bus together 'family'?  I think the Gores fail to make a distinction between the `family' and `community' -- possibly in the hopes of being all-inclusive.  As a result, they're political correctness ends up turning the entity of the family into a watery, vanilla mush.<br />An additional disappointment was that the Gores make very few suggestions/recommendations on how to improve or strengthen the family.  They site statistics and problems, but no answers.  That's frustrating.  They spent an entire book on the subject, but don't have any solutions?<br />The Gores explore many ways in which the idea of family is being redefined.  However, I wish they had explained why some of those changes are 'bad' and some are 'good'.  That is, day-care is viewed as bad, but alternative family make-up is viewed as good.  What are they using to determine their what the family should be?  Is it personal preference?  Is it unchangable principle?  Is it polling data?  This is unclear.<br />In short, this book is little more than a few personal experiences and some general observations.  It could have been so much more.	2002-12-18

However, I had a few concerns with this book.  Here they are...<br />--America's core values are not overly complex as Rosenblatt paints them to be.  Rather ideals of virtue, character, honesty, integrity, freedom, diligence, and rigor are for the most part, simple concepts.  When they do become complex is when politicians and others try to rationalize actions which go against those ideals.  I wish Rosenblatt had pointed this out.<br />--I do agree that American arrogance can be an ugly thing.  However, American pride is a beautiful thing.  This is an important but subtle distinction which I believe Rosenblatt misses.<br />--Rosenblatt is heavy on nostalgia and weaves things like small towns and baseball throughout his essay.  However, under this sweet syrup he carefully sneaks political ideology about the evils of censorship and the importance of increased gun control.  He masters this technique of guising political rhetoric beneath emotional language.  I have to be honest, this bothers me.  Rosenblatt leans to the left and desires ever-increasing government control as well as a boost in government spending.  It's fine that he believes this, but I'd prefer that he wasn't so sneaky about it.<br />-- How can Rosenblatt tell us that integrity and honesty are the ideals, which make America great and then go on to say that too much was made of a previous president's deception and bald-faced lying?  (The Clinton scandal)  Rosenblatt wants moral principles to be unshakable and foundational, but then wants to bend them when it best suits his political goals.  Unfortunately, he can't both ways.<br />In short Rosenblatt is a superior writer who couches his liberal political bent in nostalgic stories and terms.  The result is a product, which may appeal to the heart, but surely offends the mind.  Let the buyer beware.	2002-06-14

Indeed, I believe it is wise be skeptical about those kinds of reports.  It is essential to test, and critique those accounts.  However, with that said, I am also a person who has very much enjoyed the previous writing of Neuhaus - especially `The Naked Public Square'. As a result, I wasn't sure how to take this book.  Here are some thoughts.........<br />--Someone once said, `death is an interesting statistic, it's one out of one'.  We will all face death and as a result our awareness of death can be both existentially shocking as well as an intense motivator for pursuing ultimate reality and religious truth.  Neuhaus does a great job of guiding the reader to this realization.<br />--Neuhaus writes a book, which is dramatically different from books like `Embraced by the Light'.  It is a book not about warm and subjective feelings, but it is about how we face the difficulty of dieing.  How do people who believe very different things deal with death and react to dieing?  Where can we find comfort?  What is true about the after-life?  These are complex questions requiring honest answers.  Neuhaus is honest, but I wish he had been more specific regarding how he answers these questions.<br />--I do appreciate his non-sentimental writing and his willingness to write a book as personal as this one.  There's no question this book ends up being inspirational, however, I'm still not sure on exactly what Neuhaus prescribes for the problem of the human condition.  Is it religion, relationship, forgiveness, faith?  Since he is a Catholic his religious convictions do come through, but if I had my way, I wish he was a bit more theological in his conclusions.	2002-06-06

How perfectly appropriate for someone born outside the United Sates to write a book on the wonders of the American experiment.  People who are born in America all too often end up dismissing the opportunity, freedom, and decency the country offers.  D'Souza knows first hand how American ideals contrast with much of the rest of the world and as a result he appreciates and loves the country because of what it is, what is was, and has become.<br />--D'Souza does not merely drape his writing in emotional drivel and sentiment, but rather he provides sound arguments and compelling reasons for why patriotism to such a country is not only justified, but obligatory.<br />--D'Souza takes on America's critics and doesn't back down to their charges.  He shows why the extreme left and extreme right both pose threats to American freedom, character, and values.<br />--No, D'Souza does not take the reader on a blind cheerleading exercise, but rather he engages the reader with facts.  He rigorously lays out why American democracy places faith in people and then challenges his reader to declare a verdict on whether American ideologies should be preserved, and whether a call back to the country's foundations is a worthwhile pursuit.<br />--My favorite part of the book is D'Souza's exposition of the importance of combining morality with freedom.  This is such an essential element and one that too many Americans are quick to forget.  Freedom devoid of a moral foundation will quickly crumble into chaos.  However, Freedom anchored on solid ethical principles will blossom into a civilization where justice is loved and injustice is not tolerated.<br />In short, this is one of the best books of the year and one I highly recommend.	2002-05-30

Let me say that Spong writes well.  He documents well, and he is clear.  However, while his ideas are presented clearly, they are themselves muddled with confusion.  This book brought up a number of questions for me.  Here are four of them coupled with my attempt at answering...<br />Q1. Spong says Christianity needs to drop the idea of a personal and supernatural God?<br />This is like someone telling an artist that they need to drop the mountain in their mountain painting.  If that happens, they no longer have a mountain painting, but a meadow painting.  This is the thing Spong needs to realize....Christianity without God is no longer Christianity.  Spong doesn't want Christianity to change, he wants it to die....and to turn into something else.  That `something else' is a religion Spong feels comfortable with, it's the one he wants, and it's one made after his preferences.  In short he wants `Spongianity' and not Christianity.<br />Q2. Spong uses Bonhoeffer's `Religionless Christianity' to support his idea of a religion without God?<br />Hold it now.  `Religionless' does not mean `Godless'.  Bonhoeffer is promoting an authentic Christianity, which doesn't get caught up with the traps of man-made religion, but rather is one which is defined by a personal relationship with God.  Spong is truly unfair to Bonhoeffer here.<br />Q3. Spong reduces Jesus to `god-presence' and God to `the ground of all being'?<br />This is nothing more than 19th-century theological liberalism.  Spong tries to resurrect the `God is Dead' theology of the 1960's.  He refuses to admit that the `God is Dead' theology is dead and it is the one, true, living God who must be pursued in spirit and in truth.<br />Q4. Spong is seen as a `religious reformer'?<br />Reformation is a call back to the essentials.  It is a building up, not a tearing down.  Spong reforms not by carefully and rigorously making distinctions between truth and error or right and wrong, but rather, he charges at full speed and wrecks the whole china shop.  He tears down, and puts nothing in its place.  In the end he is left with an empty, ritualistic `religion' devoid of hope and meaning.and wrecks the whole china shop.

There are many reasons why this book is a needed voice in the marketplace of ideas. Environmental policies, while so needed, have become reactionary instead of strategic.  How we use our resources will have a far-reaching impact on future generations and the preservation of our planet's integrity is essential.  As a result, clear-thinking in this area is desperately needed and Lomberg does the job well.  Here are the reasons I like this book...<br />--First of all I would like to say how well documented this book is. I wish more writers followed this example. The variety of sources is truly impressive.<br />--Lomborg is clearly not \\"anti-science\\", but rather he is anti bad science. This distinction is essential. Policy makers need to keep in mind the fact that not all science is good science.  The results from studies must therefore be tested and critiqued just like everything else that's man-made.<br />--This book points out that there are those who place the environment ahead of humanity and those who place human interests as integrated with the environment. Studies, which come from each, are sometimes biased towards their ideology.<br />--Lomborg has a firm understanding of the importance of truth. No matter how noble the cause and how justified the end or goal of that cause, the means which is used to attain that end must be just as noble and just as right. Twisting data, misrepresenting environmental impact, and deceiving the public cannot be done - even in the name of good. The consequences are far too great.<br />--This book makes it clear that if we are to rightly know priorities for what should be protected, cleaned, and guarded, then truth must not be abandoned.  Only when the highest priorities are truly known can resources be rightly directed toward those issues.<br />--The unfortunate results of focusing on non-existent problems is that the real problems get ignored. Additionally, poverty stricken nations have precious few resources and it is necessary to focus those resources towards the right issues.<br />--The use of worldwide figures to account for both positive and negative trends for any given issue is a must if we are to truly think and act globally.<br />--In short there can be no valid reasons for producing poor or inflated studies.  Instead, this tactic should be called for what it is - deceit. If it's not that then it's at least inexcusable sloppiness.ry to focus those resources towards the right issues. <br />--The use of worldwide figures to account for both positive and negative trends for any given issue is a must if we are to truly think and act globally. <br />--In short there can be no valid reasons for producing poor or inflated studies.

While I believe the issues in the book are very real and need to be addressed, I have some concerns with the book as well.  They are as follows.....<br />1. The \\"Check Your Baggage\\" sections presented in this book challenge parents to recognize their own biases.  While this can be good, it should be noted that some of that baggage also contains wisdom gleaned from experiences and from deep-seated convictions.  As a result, there are certain non-negotiables, which should be adhered to with tenacity.  As a result, it would be foolish for parents to check all of their beliefs at the door.  Maybe a better approach would be for the author to have given some guidelines regarding which baggage to check and which to keep.<br />2. I appreciated the fact that Wiseman offered scripts for discussing difficult issues and advice on how to deal with them.  Now, this is real, it is practical, and it takes the theoretical and shows how to apply it to life-settings.<br />3. Regarding homosexuality, author presents the question to parents of \\"What do you think caused your heterosexuality?\\".  She wants parents to view heterosexuality as another, equally valid, moral choice -- along side of heterosexuality.  Wiseman's pro-lesbian agenda comes through in this section.  She plainly believes these vastly different sexual lifestyles are conditioned by culture and experiences, but believes that neither is more normative or fulfilling than the other.  However, for the parents who believe homosexuality is outside of one's intended design, the question of `what caused your heterosexuality is equivalent to `what caused you to choose that which you were designed to do?'  What I mean is, the question does not supercede the bottom line moral question.<br /><br />4. So many of the issues dealt with in the book from gossip, to sex, to drugs, to drinking are all either moral issues or related to ethical conduct.  The  author provides no real direction for what can be determined as right and what should be determined as wrong.  She makes judgments on behavior, but without a clear source or an apparent means of differentiating the two.<br />5. In conclusion...regarding the social minefields of female adolescence and the deep scarring that can result; I would suggest `Odd Girl Out' over this book.be determined as wrong.

This is a book, which addresses a particular struggle I've dealt with during much of my own life.  Being more of an imaginative and dynamic learner, I continually asked the question of `why' during school lessons.  If I could not understand why the information was important I would resist learning it.  Fortunately, this book address different styles of learning and how each type is particularly gifted.<br />-- The vignettes of children who struggle with different leering situations is particularly helpful in being able to grasp the challenge different learners have.<br />-- He challenges the increase in attention deficit disorder diagnosis.  This is something I believe needs to be addressed and I'm glad to see that author contributing positively by criticizing this trend.  Medication should never be prescribed to a child for simply displaying a different learning pattern.<br />-- Since different minds learn differently, it would have been helpful if the author included a section on how to cultivate a child's learning strengths.  That is, what areas, activities, and interests typically most appeal to children with a certain learning tendency?<br />-- Of course the area of the book which allows parents to work around learning weaknesses is very helpful.  Simply because a child is not strong in one area, does not mean that the child cannot grow in that area.<br />-- In the end, it comes down to a parent's willingness to spend the time necessary to really get to know a child's strengths and weakness.  This requires energy, willingness and attention, but in the end results in a child with confidence and enthusiasm for learning.	2002-05-09

First of all Bernard Lewis is a gifted writer and a very competent historian.  This is a book which it not very politically correct, but is at the same time so needed.  Here are a few main ideas the author presents.  I believe there is a logical flow here.....<br />#1, The accomplishments of the Islamic world were enormous through the middle ages (industry, government, education, culture, art, and my favorite which I wish Lewis would have spent more time on - philosophy) This point is without question or controversy.<br />#2, There was a dramatic cultural shift when the West transitioned from the dark ages and the enlightenment took place, followed by the industrial revolution.  At this time the Islamic centers of power and influence crumbled. This point is without question or controversy<br />#3, The Islamic world continues to languish as a result and their reaction has been generally hostile towards the West as a result of this power shift.  This point is where the controversy arises.<br />#4, Why did the change in human achievement take place?  This is by far the most interesting and most controversial question.<br />Lewis gets into some very intriguing comparisons between Christianity and Islam.  Ideas do have consequences.  What people believe does effect what they do.  The fundamental beliefs of Islam had not changed since its inception, so why was there such a blatant change in accomplishments and advancement?  This question is incredibly non-politically correct to even ask today.  However, I believe it is a key question and the answer is essential to know if healthy dialog is going to begin which will move us towards a solution to the tension now more present than ever between West and East.	2002-05-07

The research he's done is truly impressive, and the stories he tells are quite engrossing.  As the drama of the story unfolds and Johnson is shown to be the Master of the Senate, Caros is shown to be the master of political history.  The intensity of his writing and the colorful accounts combine to make a brilliant book.<br />1. Caro points out how there were very few people before Johnson who really understood the inter-workings of the political machine and more importantly, how to manipulate it. Johnson was superior at maneuvering the Senate to get what he wanted.<br />2. The book clearly documents how Johnson pulled off the 1957 Civil Rights Act. This accomplishment showed Johnson's ambition and drive. The darker side of this feat was the means used to achieve it were somewhat ruthless. He forced his way through the Senate. (This is much more common today, but should it be tolerated and accepted like it is?)<br />3. Johnson was rather anxious and suffered from depression -- it could be argued that much of the cause of his external anguish was the use of his cut-throat tactics.  However, I think Caro is fairly gracious here.  Still, not all means are justifiable even though the ends may be good. I'm not sure if LBJ clearly understood this.<br />In summary, Caro writes a provocative book and one which develops Johnson's work in the Senate with care and wit.	2002-05-06

Books	2	12	18	N	N	Funny book..........but a bit far-fetched	OK, first of all, I loved Moore's 'Roger and Me', and like Moore's sense of humor.  However, he doesn't hold much back here and the result is a full showing of his true colors.<br />If you want to read a real downer, here it is. The economy is in trouble, our environment is sickly, our energy crises has never been worse, public relations are in shambles, and unless we get Bush out of the office we are in a hopeless situation.  If a person wasn't firmly grounded in reality one would think it's the end of the world!  Everything you thought was OK -- he trashes.<br />Moore's writing style, humor, and critiques are more in line with WWF showmanship than real arguments.  As a result, he offers a paltry, but entertaining read. However, if you're looking for something a bit more weighty and serious, look elsewhere.<br />Moore is serious about ousting Bush.  On what grounds?  Well, not much outside of the fact that Moore doesn't care for Bush's moderate policies.  Moore is a fringe liberal who can't stand the idea of free-markets, capitalism, and competition -- and he would tell you that. (and does in this book)<br />He rants on about how America is no longer able to hold free and fair elections.  Who is he kidding?  We need the U.N. to step in and help us?  With sentiments like this, who can take him seriously? (I mean apart from a serious and good comedian.)<br />Moore's book flies directly in the face of the majority of Americans, and slaps along the way.  He pounds Bush - mercilessly - all while Bush enjoys a 70% approval rating.  Just when all the mud thrown during the elections has settled, here's Moore throwing his own dirt.  It's funny enough, but chapter after chapter gets a bit tiresome.<br />One thing Moore gets right is that Americans are upset about the situation in America.  What he doesn't get right is the source of their frustration.  He makes it sound like Americans are mad at being able to live in a free country and a land of opportunity.  He ignores the fact that Americans are sick of paying high taxes, sick of paying high dollars for foreign oil/gas, sick of government regulation, sick of additional/unnecessary legislation, sick of social programs mired in bureaucracy, and sick of an education system which gets worse every year.  If he wants something to jump up and down on, try these issues.the fact that Americans are sick of paying high taxes, sick of paying high dollars for foreign oil/gas, sick of government regulation, sick of additional/unnecessary legislation, sick of social programs mired in bureaucracy, and sick of an education system which gets worse every year.

Here they are........<br />#1, Eldredge thinks Christian men should stop being just a `bunch of \\"really nice guys\\".  While I agree the Christian life is much more than merely being nice to other people, the NT clearly makes love the defining characteristic.  Love of God and love of others should be the defining mark for any believer -- male or female.  However, after reading this book a person would be more inclined to think that being wild, passionate and free should be the defining marks.  They may have a role, but I suggest they are secondary.<br />#2, Eldredge claims that Christian men are 'bored' and that they need more adventure.  However, based on my own experiences boredom is not due to a lack of entertainment and adventure, but it is because of a lack of purpose.  Boredom comes from exhausting my passion for myself instead of seeking after God and becoming a man after God's own heart.<br />#3, Eldredge claims God designed men to be 'dangerous'.  I'm still trying to figure out how this fits in with the fall.  What I mean is, before the fall (before Adam sinned) was Adam created by God to be 'dangerous'?  If so, then who was Adam to be dangerous towards -- himself, his wife, God?  If God did not design Adam to be dangerous, but danger is now a characteristic in men, then that must have come from the fall, and is a result of sin?  If so, then embracing this danger cannot be glorifying to God, because it is a result of sin.<br />#4, Eldredge encourages men to come to grips with their \\"secret longings\\".  Boy, I have some secret longings which would be disastrous for me to pursue.  The only secret longing which can be pursued without qualification is God.  To hunger and thirst after Him as the sole desire of our heart should be the goal of every Christian man.  The purity of heart is to will one thing and for the Christian that's  willing God's glory and finding my rest in Him.  Eldredge introduces this, but it's not clearly stated and our passion for adventure clouds the purity of a heart after God.<br />#5, Eldredge weaves numerous stories, movie quotes, pop music lyrics and other tidbits in with the selected Bible passages.  This is something I noticed in the Sacred Romance - his other book.  He mixes pop culture in with the Word, and bounces back and forth between the two.  I truly don't think it's unfair to say a person ends up with the impression that both are equally valid teaching tools or lesson providers.  There's no qualitative distinction between the two.  He doesn't say, `OK this is what the world thinks, now let's contrast that what God has to say.'.....instead he lays them  side by side and promotes both as sources of truth and guidance.<br />#6, Eldredge emphasizes freedom as an end.  Freedom is a means, but is never an end.  It is the means by which one chooses holy living.<br />#7, Unfortunately the book becomes anthropocentric or egocentric.  Yes, it uses a bunch of Christian lingo, and uses some Bible verses, but for the reasons above it ends up focusing on human passion and desires, and not a godly passion. (although the latter is mentioned)<br />#8, Eldredge encourages men to become like `little boys'.  This reminds me of Pauls words in the NT encourageing Christians to leave childish things behind.  Eldredge asks men to go backwards in order to go forwards.  There's nothing wrong with entertainment until it takes center stage.<br />#9, If you want good stories read this book if you want good theology read the NT.<br />#10, It would have been helpful if Eldredge had included a section on the dangers of following our hearts and listening to our hearts.  It would have been great if he would have touched on Christian self-denial and how to live a life of service for others and primarily for one's family.  Self-sacrifice isn't popular, but it is what leads to a truly fulfilling life, not self-gratification.

I believe John Edwards and do not question his motives, nor do I believe he is a charlatan/swindler who is just out for money.  In fact, I'm not skeptical at all, and believe that he does hear voices, just as he claims.  However, I have a few concerns with this book.  Please read below....<br />#1  A major difference with this book compared to Van Praagh's book is the Edward's shows seekers how they can recognize and develop their on psychic abilities.  The thing I wish he had included is a means by which the person who is receiving the messages can know if these messages are accurate.  I guess accuracy or truthfulness is assumed?<br />#2  Edward's book has convinced many that there is in fact an afterlife and that the spirit realm does exist.  The thing the book does not do is tell readers what this spirit world is like.  This world, the physical world we live in, is obviously a dangerous place.  Is the spirit world like that?  This world has both good and bad people in it.  Is the spirit world like that?  If it is, can we contact both good and bad spirits?  This would be helpful to know.<br />#3, While it seems to be good for a person to be open minded, shouldn't we also be discerning?  What I mean is, Edwards states that it is best to simply `claim' psychic abilities instead of questioning them.  This seems to divorce the mind from the subject ...so that truth is no longer what is sought...but rather experiences.  Is that right and good to do?  This question about truthfulness can then never be answered unless it is raised and the author discourages the reader from even raising it.<br />#4, `One Last Time, to Say Goodbye'....Think about that statement.  We have all lost loved ones.  Well, I would think almost everyone has.  How many of us long for just that, `One Last Time, to Say Goodbye'?  We each want that to be true, and we each want that chance.  However, it still seems best to not allow those deep emotions to over-ride our mind and ability to think clearly and critically.  Again, I don't question Edwards's abilities, but I do have concerns about who is on the other end of the line.  Who are we saying goodbye to?  Is it indeed our loved one?<br />#5, Many people claim to be comforted by the stories Edwards shares in the book.  I do think these accounts can be compelling reasons to believe in metaphysical realities.  However, while we may then know spirits exist, how can we know for certain that spirits cannot lie?  Ok, much of what Edwards says is correct regarding the deceased person he is `speaking with'.  Could this be a spirit who knows these things, but is not the spirit it claims to be? (Maybe it's another spirit and not that person?)  I'm just asking the question here.  Are these valid and fair questions to be asking?  I believe they are.<br />In short, I believe this book raises more questions than it answers, and I would like to here the author's answers to the points above.  Can the spirit world always be trusted and/or is it a dangerous place?  Inquiring minds want to know.ly and critically.  Again, I don't question Edwards's abilities, but I do have concerns about who is on the other end of the line.  Who are we saying goodbye to?  Is it indeed our loved one?<br />#5, Many people claim to be comforted by the stories Edwards shares in the book.

Ok, much of what Edwards says is correct regarding the deceased person he is `speaking with'.  Could this be a spirit who knows these things, but is not the spirit it claims to be? (Maybe it's another spirit and not that person?)  I'm just asking the question here.  Are these valid and fair questions to be asking?  I believe they are.  <br />In short, I believe this book raises more questions than it answers, and I would like to here the author's answers to the points above.  Can the spirit world always be trusted and/or is it a dangerous place?  Inquiring minds want to know.	2002-05-03

First of all, let me say that I do not question James Van Praggh's abilities.  However, I have some real concerns with some of the things mentioned in this book.  I was not so much comforted as I was baffled, and disappointed.  Here is why......<br />1. Van Praagh talks about Karma, so reincarnation is part of his belief system about the afterlife.  In Eastern religions which adhere to a belief in Karma there is no such place as heaven.  Does Van Pragh believe heaven is a real place?  It does seem so, but if he does then how can reincarnation or a view of continued life on this planet be consistent with a transcendent place called heaven? This doesn't make sense.<br />2. Van Praagh claims that he is talking to heaven.  I believe he is talking to someone, but how does he know he is speaking directly to heaven?  What I mean is this, let's say you know of a person, but have never met them, then you talk to that person on the phone.  The person claims to be the person, but you have no means by which to know what the person's voice is like or what their phone mannerisms are.  How do you know for certain you are talking to the right person?  You don't, but must take it on faith.  Likewise, how does Van Praagh know he is talking to a person's dead Uncle?  He doesn't.  He takes it on faith.  My question is, could he be talking to someone or something else?  Could he be wrong?<br />3. The book claims to answer the most profound questions about life and death.  What answer does it provide to these questions about life and death?  What I mean is, speaking to the dead is presented as the summation of the answer.  Life goes on.  Ok, but in what regard, or format, or quality?  The thing I wonder about is, does Praagh suggest that all people go to heaven?  Hitler, Dalmer, Milosovich?  If so, then there's nothing we can do to alter our eternal destination?  If we can impact it, then what must we do, or how should we live, or what should we believe?  These are enormous questions, which the book is silent on.  I don't see how not knowing the answer to these can be so comforting.<br />4. People who have lost loved ones are emotionally vulnerable -- that is undeniable.  As a result, when Praagh makes his declarations, people desperately want what he says to be true.  That people go on, and everything is happy. I do think he is accurate in relaying what he `hears'.  However, if there is good and bad in this world, how do we know what his source of information is?  I'm simply saying it may be naïve to blindly accept that Praagh is speaking to whom he thinks he is speaking.  We better have strong evidence if we are to believe Praagh cannot be mistaken on this.<br />5. Pets play a pretty big role in the book.  Pets go on.  People go on.  What's the difference?  There doesn't seem to be any moral foundation or basis for going on.  I mean, pets are not, nor cannot be moral or immoral, but people are.  Does morality factor into an afterlife?  Many people don't want it to, and it seems that Praagh is then telling people what they want to hear -- at least in this regard.<br />In short, I'm not skeptical about Praagh, I think he believes everything he says.  I'm just not sure that he is not himself deceived.  I would have liked it if he would have provided some objective criteria for determining the authenticity of messages from beyond. (In order to answer the question of certainty regarding who, what, and why)  Is it wise to believe what Praagh believes?  I guess this is the question.hich the book is silent on.

Of the ethical systems popular today, so many of them reduce to calculations which depend on the question, `What do I get out of this?'  Decisions are made based on the consequences, or perceived consequences of actions.  Utilitarianism, consequentialism, egoism, relativism are all challenged by this book -- which is really about ethics.  It's a book about how we should live.<br />With this said, I believe there are still `reasons' for doing the right thing.  I mean, doing what is universally right does not &quot;fly in the face of logic&quot; -- it is not irrational.  If there is a greater purpose or meaning to life than simply pleasure, or happiness then giving your best, helping people, loving others, doing good, and being honest are then done in light of a greater, transcendent context.  However, if one believes this world is all there is (no afterlife, no eternity, no purpose), then I would expect that person to challenge the premise and conclusion of this book.  People should live for themselves exclusively and for the moment and not help others.  To avoid this challenge and in order to anchor his ethics (the list) I believe the author needs to first firmly establish this framework of ultimate meaning.  I know he says, `do it anyway', but there are still reasons for `doing it anyway'.  Yes, it's the right thing to do, but there are still reasons for why it is the right thing to do.<br />This book brings to mind an anecdote from the life of Ronald Reagan.  A political advisor told President Reagan that he was making the wrong decision because the political consequences would be bad and his popularity rating would drop.  Reagan told the advisor to never talk to him about consequences, but rather to advise him only regarding what is objectively right to do.  What a difference this is compared to so many political leaders today who need to `test the wind' via polls before every decision.  This book is about doing the right thing -- regardless.  (Not a popular subject, but one that needed to be written.)ubject, but one that needed to be written.)	2002-05-02

If you enjoy reading rags like the National Enquirer in the States, or anything that is passed for a news rag here in London, this is the book for you because you will believe anything.  I half expected Elvis to show up in the ancient paintings they were \\"interpreting\\".<br />The book is supposedly a shocking expose, which illuminates ancient secrets hidden for thousands of years, all of which provide information contrary to the Bible.  OK, I am intrigued.  So, I pick up the book and after several stops and starts because it is so incredibly dull, I manage to force my way through it.  I was shocked; they did get that right.  But shocked that their theories were built on such flimsy and obviously biased wishful thinking.  Oh, but wait that's not all: they then base even more theories on top of these weak foundations.  You will get used to reading several \\"one might assume\\", and \\"if this was true, then this might be' kinds of reasoning on every page.  The photos are interesting, and some of the theories (especially the Jesus and Mary - Isis God theory) are worth reading if only for a laugh.<br />This book is so bad; it is almost good in a \\"B\\" horror movie kind of way. I could almost see those chaps on Mystery Theatre 3000 in the foreground making wisecracks along the way.  Good reading if you have literally nothing else to do.  Oh, and if you find yourself buying this rubbish, perhaps you would like to come by my flat and pay for my rubbish - it goes out every Tuesday, and I will only charge you a few pence.	2002-04-28

I have always been curious as to why evolution is taken as \\"fact\\" when there are so many gaps, yet the same people will trash intelligent design or creation theories by scoffing at the \\"god in the gaps\\" approach.  Seems a bit hypocritical.  The book shows just how hypocritical it really is.<br />I liked the science and the logical process by which the author dissects the holes and gaps in the evolution theory, by exposing the complete lack of foundation for any proof of how the infinitely complex life was formed.  I won't bore you with all the technical details, as you can read the book and get those, but the basic premise is that the theories, which supposedly address this problem within the theory of evolution, are pathetically weak.  The book illuminates this weakness clearly.<br />The second half of the book was more philosophical.  Several sound philosophical arguments are postulated, and the result is that when coming to the end of the book, one is left with the unavoidable feeling that the supposed scientists who espouse the evolution philosophy are merely emotionally protecting a worldview, not postulating any facts.  ...<br />A decent book overall, worth wading through the technical depictions for an excellent conclusion.	2002-04-27

Sure, my life may have a root core, and understanding that may be the way to create my life the way it was meant to be.  However, I was surprised that the goal of this understanding, as presented by the Dr., is for me to get what I want.  What I mean is, I am suppose to use the information, for me, to get what I want out of life, so that I am satisfied.  Sure, there is nothing wrong with personal satisfaction, but the way it is promoted in this book it is more self-centered and self-aggrandizing.  What happened to self-satisfaction through serving and loving others?  What happened to doing what is right, regardless of what I get out of it?  Yes, the self matters, but it is not all that matters.<br />I do like the idea of evaluating the ten most defining moments of a person's life, as well as the five most pivotal people in a person's life.  These items do help in conceptualizing the moments which shape a person's worldview.  Furthermore, understanding these may allow a person to abandon false excuses given to excuse non-productive and dangerous behaviors.  However, this may simply result in a clearer understanding of the problem, while providind an answer to that problem.  The answer needs to be separate from the problem and I don't think this is conveyed in this book.  Rather understanding the problem is the answer.  However, that doesn't provide enough substance.<br />The large assumption I believe Dr. Phil makes is that if a person finds their true self, that true self will be what that person should be.  I truly don't think he acknowledges the possibility that a person may find their true self and that self may be still be in need of reformation or healing.  He criticizes the victim mentality and then goes on to suggest that each person is inherently good, but they have been tainted/damaged through life.  (ie: victims)  It would be helpful if he acknowledged the disconnect/contradiction here and explained how these two items fit together.  (or admit that one should be abandoned)<br />In short, this is a feel-good self-esteem book.  It is very different from some of the other books which attempt to get at the heart of the issue through deep introspection, analysis, and confrontation.  If his premise is correct, that people are basically good and need to wake up to that, then this is a good book.  However, if another premise is correct, that people are flawed, and in need of a serious prescription to a serious problem, then this book degrades to self-delusion and a false self-esteem.uld be abandoned)<br />In short, this is a feel-good self-esteem book.

While I can appreciate the risks Myss takes with this book, and her highly creative mind I do have a some serious concerns with some of the underlying assumptions.  They are these........<br />1. First, how do we know for certain that we make Sacred Contracts before we are born? This seems to be highly speculative. I mean, it could be, but how do we know for sure? Also, what objective criteria would one use in discovering the content of the contract? Is it just intuitive? There's a lot of guesswork here -- to be sure.  It gets fuzzy right from the start.<br />2. With whom is the contract made, and what are the consequences if one does not fulfill the contract? Are their negative consequences for breaking one's vow?  Is the vow made with God?  I'm still not clear on this.<br />3. Myss is specific on the classification of archetypes, but admits there may be dozens or hundreds more. How does she know that these are all legitimate archetypes? This is a very different view from Plato's understanding of eternal forms. Plato believed the forms are universal, perfect, incorruptible, and all participate in the ultimate form of the good. Jung takes the forms re-works them, and ends up with a rather splintered and fragmented view. (the archetypes seem to be persons or spirits as Jung presents them.) Then Myss gets takes Jung's archetypes, splinters them further, and adds a dark twist -- confusing more than clarifying.  I wonder where all of this is going to end?<br />4. I think Myss is correct with her diagnosis of a metaphysical disease which effects all people and expresses itself through depression, anxiety, fatigue, and physical illness.  Humans are ill. However, her prescription for curing that disease (being one's own spiritual doctor) is unconvincing. If the source of the disease is external then why is an external cure not needed?  What I mean is, if we are truly ill, why is that not a result of our failure to keep our contract?  If it is, should we not seek the forgiveness of the One we have broken the contract with?  Myss seems to say, 'no - we just try harder.'<br />5. If Myss wants to promote her view over other metaphysical views, it would may be best for her to explain why the other views are wrong. Either we have entered into sacred contracts in a pre-existence or we have not. Since so many other worldviews don't acknowledge this belief, I don't find it very compelling. If Myss is right, then so many others are wrong, as many religions deny a pre-existent state.  Yes, she presents some similar views found in other religions, but these are obscure and an extreme minority.<br />In short, Myss's ideas are interesting, but I believe this book ends up being more fictional.  If it is fiction I begin to wonder if it is leading people from the truth instead of towards it.eness of the One we have broken the contract with?

The subtle aggression of girls is so insidious and is often difficult to rid later in life.<br />The self-esteem of girls is often tied into what other people (peers) think of them.  Their desire for approval and praise unfortunately turns into a weakness when other's words and actions target what they long for...ofen through gossip and silence.<br />The great thing about Simmons is that although she spends a fair amount of time identifying the issues and expounding the problem, she does not leave the reader without hope.  Rather, she clearly presents solutions and exercises to heal and prevent further damage.<br />One thing, which would have been helpful, is if this book would have provided a means by which those who are at high-risk to be bullied can be identified, as well as those who are at high-risk to bully.  This would go a long ways in prevention, as well as getting to the heart of the matter instead of dealing with symptoms and results.  For instance, what are the common threads found in those who bully, and what motivates them?  Simmons touches on this, but I wish she had dealt with it in more detail.<br />The home seems to be so key here.  Providing a place where hatred, meanness, destructive words, and aggression is not tolerated would go a long ways in creating schools and common places which are free from these acidic behaviors.  Unfortunately this is not often the case, but rather many of these behaviors are learned in the home and then brought into social settings to be used as weapons.	2002-04-25

First of all I do think the present is very important and is where living takes place. I'm sure the authors are well-intentioned in writing this book. I always enjoy taking 'break time' when reading and during this time I've discovered some concerns I have with 'The Power of Now', please read below.....<br />1. While it may be true that living in the 'now' is the truest path to happiness, the 'now' is only meaningful in the context of the past and the future. Without true meaning, purpose, and hope, a meaningful 'now' is illusory.<br />2. Do some people live solely in the past or future and thereby ignore the present? Certainly.  But that does not mean that a proper time-context for the present should be abandoned? For instance a great amount of satisfaction can and should be taken for past accomplishments and past relationships. Additionally, looking forward to future goals and activities can provide a huge amount of satisfaction.<br />3. Our true identity is not merely our moment-to-moment experience, but is substantially shaped by our past and our future hopes. To ignore this or to pretend this is not the case is to invite delusion. Past memories and experiences do shape a person's worldview, and future hopes do affect current decisions. Living as if there is no future is not only hopeless, but it fosters madness.<br />4. If the future has no place in a healthy and peaceful existence, then the person who has just won the lottery should be just as content as the person who is sitting on death-row. The now is the now, and the now is not affected by past of future? That smacks in the face of common sense.<br />5. If being totally aware of ourselves at each moment means that we need to stop our thoughts, then the pursuit of truth should be abandoned. Why be concerned about discovering the truth in the future if all a person must do is convince oneself that the now is all there is?<br />6. It does seem possible to live a pain free existence by living fully in the present. However, is it worth it? Is it worth abandoning one's past, and ignoring one's future? These both are far to valuable to exchange for a pain-free life.<br />7. Some people may exclaim with great joy that 'all there is, is now', but is that true? Can it be liberating? Yes. Is it illusory? Yes. Is it worth it? No.<br />8. The author claims the humans are being trapped in a constant cycle of emotional illusions. This is exactly what Tolle is doing by promoting the illusion of a monistic view of the present.<br />9. While it may be true that some thoughts and emotions get in our way of living in genuine peace, that does not mean that all thoughts and emotions are negative. In fact, many thoughts and emotions contribute significantly to a fulfilling life. Unfortunately the author swipes too broadly and pushes all aside, instead of carefully and intentionally distinguishing the good from the bad.<br />10. The author is basically right in the conclusions of this book, provided there is no ultimate purpose in life, and that there is no future in which we can place our hope. However, if these premises are not valid, the conclusions are baseless.<br />In conclusion, a worldview that provides a true and good hope in the future, based on the reality of the past is much more effective at securing a true peace in the present. May that hope not be in vain.present. However, is it worth it? Is it worth abandoning one's past, and ignoring one's future? These both are far to valuable to exchange for a pain-free life. <br />7.

Additionally, I think this topic is a much needed one.  For these I've given two stars.  I've take three for the reasons below.....<br />1.Kaplan asserts that good governments emerge from a `sly understanding of men's passions'.  Knowing the propensity of the human heart to grab and abuse power is a Judeo-Christian teaching.  It's not clear how Kaplan is deriving this belief solely on pagan grounds.  Additionally, if he is, it does not exclusively pagan.  Certainly the founding fathers believed in the depravity of the human heart and structured the constitution around a balance of power.<br />2.The idea that human nature does not change and that the problem of violence is eternal is presented in the book.  However, instead of seeing this as a moral problem, which can be reformed, Kaplan seems to give way to the idea that might makes right.<br />3.Kaplan's argument for a foreign policy based solely on state interest is utilitarian.  However, what he ignores is that state interest devoid of a moral anchor becomes barbarism.  Humanity degrades into a selfish power struggle when each state is simply looking out for its own interests.  Pork-barrel economics develops between countries.  Furthermore, promise keeping is undermined while distrust is promoted.<br />4.Kaplan is big on learning from the lessons of the past.  However, he does not acknowledge that in order for lessons to be learned, value judgments need to be passed on good/bad experiences/consequences.  As a result, unless there are objective criteria by which to determine good and bad, the lessons cannot be learned adequately learned from the past.  Lesson learning degrades to utilitarianism.<br />5.Kaplan suggests that it is short sighted to insist on elections in a country, which would result in the election of a tyrant.  True, but what is the remedy?  Doesn't moral reform and education of the populous make sense, thereby providing the voters with a framework by which to make good voting decisions?<br />6.Kaplan states that countries should ruthlessly promote their own interests.  What if those interests include genocide?  Should 1939 Germany ruthlessly promote its own interest?  He needs to qualify this, and can only do so with a moral theory which he is seemingly not willing to admit.<br />7.There is a reason why Kaplan's political and philosophical prescriptions apply particularly well to America and not to much of the rest of the world. (North Korea, Rawanda, Kosovo, Iraq)  This is because America is good.  If America ceased being good Kaplan's theories are absurd.  What I mean by good is that America is based on Judeo-Christian values, which promote justice, fairness, decency, honesty, etc.<br />8.Kaplan ignores workable and sound just war theory.  Some country's ends are evil and as a result their war efforts cannot be justified.  This is an essential distinction which I wish Kaplan made - but obviously won't because it again requires Judeo-Christian values.<br />9.Kaplan talks of promoting self-interest for the greater good.  How is this idea of good retained?  Unqualified selfishness cannot result in the greater good.  This doesn't make sense.<br />10.There is no place for self-sacrifice, honor, or altruism in Kaplan's view.  This flies in the face of common sense.pulous make sense, thereby providing the voters with a framework by which to make good voting decisions?<br />6.Kaplan states that countries should ruthlessly promote their own interests.

The naturalist, materialist, and empiricist will cringe at Polanyi's book.  True knowledge for Polanyi is derived as the mind becomes an active contributor to knowledge and appropriates knowledge through reason.  In this regard he is similar to Kant.<br />Dogmatic and exclusive science is thereby dethroned and caste not lower than other forms of knowledge, but along side them.  Knowledge based on authority and experience is shown to be interpersonal and relational.  As a result, knowledge truly is personal and is not abstract.  Therefore, knowledge derived via philosophy, religion, or authority can be just as valid as that which is derived from the chemistry set.  This is a difficult task, but Polanyi works hard and ends with a compelling accomplishment.	2002-03-29

The difficulty I have with Dr. Weiss's book is that it makes a large assumption and applies it to all people. The book assumes that past difficulties are the cause of current pain. However, what if current difficulties are the cause of current pain? There is no suggested means of first discovering when the cause of the pain occurred. As a result, it may be ongoing and in the present. If this is the case, regression therapy cannot help. This is an essential distinction which I wish Dr. Weiss recognized and addressed.<br />Furthermore, the idea of 'past difficulties' subtly places current pain outside the realm of personal responsibility. What I mean is, if karma has been damaged by one's self there appears to be a certain level or responsibility included in that. More specifically, if a person makes bad moral decisions that may be the cause of the damage. As a result, if poor moral decisions continue then karma continues to be damaged. This is an area I wish Dr. Weiss addressed instead of making the cause always external and thereby doing away with personal fault/responsiblity.<br />The techniques expressed in this book have also been described as 'karma transformation exercises'. Belief that individuals have the ability to transform karma is highly speculative. Just because individuals may be guilty of committing actions which harm karma does not necessarily mean those individuals are capable of reversing those effects.  As a result, an external source of healing must be sought.<br />In short, the real key to avoiding current pain does not seem to be the recommendations of Dr. Weiss, but rather a real and right discovery of objective truth.....followed by adaptation in the form of right behavior. If violation of moral principles is where guilt comes from (the source) then is seems this is a better place to start. Now the question becomes which worldview provides the most reasonable explanation of moral law?  I know many people cringe at this idea because it invokes accountability.  This isn't a popular theme - especially in the new-age movement.  However, if God exists, and is the source of morality -- damage of karma is a violation against God.s accountability.

Yes, this book contains some general practical advice, and for this I have allowed two stars.  However, I was disappointed with his teaching and `preachy' method in that it tells a person how to feel, but doesn't tell that person why he/she should feel a certain way.  What I mean is this, the author tells the reader not to allow other people's words to hurt them.  He says one should not take other's words seriously. (he's talking about criticism)  However, what if that person who is doing the criticizing is right?  For instance, what if it is a friend who cares about you and is pointing out dangerous beliefs or dangerous behavior?  What if the criticism is true?  The author gives no basis by which the reader can determine if the criticism is valid.  That's a problem.<br /><br />Yes, it's true that a person's parents shape one's worldview, because they do influence one's value system.  That part is undeniable.  However, it would have been very helpful if a chapter was included which would help a person determine if what he/she was taught by their parents is good and worthy of emulation, or if it is bad and should be abandoned.  Some objective criteria would be nice.<br /><br />Now, lastly there is the issue of pride.  The `method' conveyed by Ruiz seems to be self-centered.  Do we really raise our self-esteem through self-promotion and self-aggrandizement?  What happened to raising self-esteem through serving and loving others?  This is a subtle, but important distinction which is key to healthy relationships.  Ruiz seems to ignore this.	2002-03-25

However, Spong admits the 'Christianity' he desires leaves no room for God -- at least no room for a personal diety with a moral will.<br /><br />Here are my top five disappointments with, \\"Why Christianity Must Change or Die.\\"<br /><br />1. Spong argues propositional statements should not be used to describe God. However, Spong ends up describing his 'god' in propositional terms. ('ground of all being', 'source of life', 'source of love')  I cry, 'foul'.<br /><br />2. Spong reinterprets Bonhoeffer's 'religionless Christianity' into a Christianity without God. This is flatly unfair to Bonhoeffer. Bonhoeffer was contrasting 'religion' with 'relationship' by describing how religion (or man's attempts) can get in the way of a right relationship with God through Jesus.  I cry, 'foul'.<br /><br />3. Spong accurately describes Augustine's theological beliefs, but then suggests that Augustine was the originator of doctrines like the atonement and original sin. These are both early doctrines clearly articulated by Paul.  I cry, 'foul'.<br /><br />4. Spong clings tenaciously to the title of 'believer' while dismantling belief in anything objective. If he were to be honest, he is no longer a believer because he has nothing to believe in - well, other than himself.  I cry, 'foul'.<br /><br />5. The title of the book is \\"Why Christianity Must Change or Die\\". The changes Spong proposes are so extreme and final that a better title would be \\"Why Christianity must Die\\".  Spong rejects Christianity not because it is illogical, untrue, or unfounded, but because he is offended by it. Perhaps an even more accurate title would be \\"Why Bishop Spong is not a Christian\\" What is described here is not Christianity, but rather it is a religion Spong wishes for - it is 'Spongianity' for he makes a religion after his own heart and in his image. Maybe that's the best title of all, \\"Spongianity\\" by Spong.	2002-03-22

This Jesus is very different from the Jesus conveyed in scripture, as well as through history.  Both cannot be true.  Which is right?  This is the book which answers that question.	2002-03-21

Unfortunately, I think my expectations were a bit too high as I was continually disappointed with the assumptions and conclusions of the book.<br />First of all, I had a difficult time following the reasoning behind the idea that mere translations of the bible had transformed beliefs about the historical Jesus.  It would seem that a right understanding of the original texts could get one back to an accurate understanding of the person of Jesus - if that has been swayed and changed over time.  Going back to the original texts was never mentioned in the book.<br />Mr. Vermes states that by the end of the first century an accurate understanding of Jesus had been departed from as the original message was lost.  However, Vermes fails to compellingly point out why this happened, or provide evidence for this speculation.  He ignores the fact that many eyewitnesses would have still been around and would have refuted or at least attempted to correct inaccurate information.<br />Unfortunately, I found the book to be rather biased, and containing weak reasoning.  I'm starting to wonder if scholars feel they need to come up with something original in order to promote their careers.<br />Simply because there are not a large number of first-hand accounts outside of the biblical accounts does not necessarily mean the biblical accounts are false.  This is the type of reasoning one has to endure while reading through this book.<br />The big assumption Mr. Vermes makes is that the historical details surrounding the life of Jesus are inaccurate.  This was an enormous leap with very little persuading evidence.  He then attempts to get to the kernels of truth under these errant details.  However, the author fails to provide any objective criteria regarding how this is done, nor does he provide any criteria for how some passages are reliable and others not reliable.  It seems he suggests the passages which point to supernatural occurrences are incorrect and those suggesting Jesus wisdom, humanity, and political workings are correct.  In short, he appears to have a strong anti-supernatural bias.  If the bible is approached in this manner, then he is not being objective, but is reading into the texts what he has already determined is there............... his bias is never supported with reasons, logic, and deduction.ggests the passages which point to supernatural occurrences are incorrect and those suggesting Jesus wisdom, humanity, and political workings are correct.

The UK, I'm quite sure, suffers from the same bent.  This  book provided me with great insight and has now directed me by enlightening certain sensibilities previously enigmatic.  What I mean is, I am now able to see the shear leaning of the media here in the UK.  The book has opened my eyes.  It has allowed me to hear the re-working of truth for an alternative purpose.<br />I highly recommend.	2002-03-15

This book is perhaps one of the biggest con attempts played on anti-religionists. The entire premise of the book is founded the authors attempt to stretch controversy so thin that just a little common sense reveals the underlying errors.<br />The authors have very little concept of statistical probability, and the use of data.  Additionally, the inconsistencies presented in the book are numerous and continue through the whole.  I find the concept of Biblical inerrancy to challenge common belief, however this book utilizes over-generalization and extreme language in order to blast the reader onto their heels.  I was expecting to find some evidence here, but instead discovered petty theories of the small-minded.<br />A must read for anyone who is desperate, yes desperate, in their attempt to find moral liberation at the expense of truth. Forget all the evidence, forget logic and reason, step right up and take a look at the folly of an emotive tirade.	2002-03-13
