I know that in this book van Pelt covers only a portion of the information that was in his reports for the Irving trial, but it was certainly enough to convince me that Judge Gray's verdict was the proper one.  This book covers a lot of technical information that would possibly be hard to digest or be boring if it were presented by another author, but van Pelt writes very well, and I had trouble setting his book down.  The author comes across as a very reasonable figure who is able to resist the urge to over-rely on either sentimentality or sarcasm.  Perhaps I will need to read something else to internalize the horror that was the Holocaust, but I don't need to read anything else to see that it really did happen.<br />Finally, let me say that I was unprepared for what a big, handsomely bound, handsomely typeset book this would be.  (I know that talking about the attractiveness of a book about the Holocaust is probably as bad as Jerry Seinfeld making out during &quot;Schindler's List&quot;, but I figured that there might be some other bibliophiles out there who care about such things.)	2004-04-22

(Their recent fiction has, in particular, an unusual number of oppressed Mormon homosexuals who end up dying by strangulation.)  Well, in spite of themselves, Signature has published a wonderful book in _The Conversion of Jeff Williams_.<br />The plot summary that Signature prints on the back cover (and that Amazon has reprinted above) really seems to miss the point of the book.  This is classic Thayer, with strong messages of redemption, grace, and love, conveyed by a story that is honestly told in simple, uncontrived language.  It is so easy to take cheap shots at various types of characters perceived to be pervasive in the LDS community, but in _Jeff Williams_ Thayer adamantly refuses to do so.  There isn't a character in this book who isn't portrayed with sympathy--a sign, I think, of Thayer's belief in the ability of grace to touch the most unlikely people.<br />In a fireside talk he gave shortly after he wrote his first novel, _Summer Fire_, Thayer opened my eyes to the beautiful message taught in Moroni 10:32-33, a message he said he tried to convey in that first book.  Through his fiction, Thayer continues to teach me wonderful things.	2004-02-17

Time and again, his views have differed from mine, and he has expressed those views in the most strident, and sometimes offensive, terms possible.  But several reviewers mentioned this book as a useful complement to Yaacov Lozowick's _Right to Exist: A Moral Defense of Israel's Wars_, a book I thought was excellent, so I decided to give _The Case for Israel_ a try.<br />Well, I'm not sure that I learned a lot from Dershowitz that I didn't learn from Lozowick, but this book is an easy read, fairly well-organized, and, for the most part, competently done.  At times I wished Dershowitz would have addressed an issue more deeply rather than (what seemed like) giving it a surface treatment.  And there was some annoying repetition within _The Case for Israel_.  I don't know if this is a style Dershowitz has developed for arguing to juries, who can't be counted on to be paying close attention the first time a point is made, or maybe it's a consequence of the book having its genesis in notes Dershowitz has been assembling over the course of 40 years, but I find it aggravating for an author to present a quote for the second or third time as if he's presenting it for the first.<br />The reaction to this book by Dershowitz's prominent critics has been interesting.  The focus of their counterattack seems to be to impugn Dershowitz's integrity by charging him with plagiarism, in particular with improperly citing primary sources rather than citing the secondary sources they say he relied upon.  That may (or may not) say something about Dershowitz's character or the care with which he assembled this book, but it's not clear what it says about Dershowitz's argument.  Some of his critics go on to assert that the secondary source he relied upon has allegedly been discredited, but when challenged to give examples of inaccuracies that Dershowitz's book inherited from that secondary source, few or none seem to be forthcoming.  When Dershowitz offered to give Norman Finkelstein $10,000 if he would point out an inaccuracy in the book, the best Finkelstein came up with is that a couple of figures are too low by a factor of 100, but these are figures that would strengthen Dershowitz's case if they were higher!  This example may benefit Finkelstein financially (if Dershowitz pays up), but it's hard to see it as more than a Pyrrhic victory when it comes to substance.  It reminds me of the gang-at-Cheers' response when they learned that Gary (of Gary's Oldtown Tavern) had tricked them into \\"pants\\"ing their hero, Wade Boggs:  \\"Look at the bright side.  We've got Wade Boggs' pants!  We're number one!

This book is advertised as being &quot;the dialogue of letters between Arthur C. Clarke and C.S. Lewis&quot;.  Well, it turns out that the letters take up a grand total of 17 pages, and there are only 8 letters from Lewis to Clarke: 1 that occupies a full page, 4 that occupy a half page each, and 3 that are 2- or 3-liners.  The vast majority of the pages in this slim book are devoted to reprinting short stories and essays available elsewhere.  Even the publishers seem to have realized that calling this a &quot;War of Letters&quot; is overblown, because when the book arrived its subtitle had been changed to &quot;The War of Ideas&quot;.<br />When it comes to CSL correspondence collections, I think this should rank dead last on prospective buyers' lists, behind _Collected Letters_ (available from the UK), _Letters of C.S. Lewis_, _Letters to an American Lady_, _The Latin Letters of C.S. Lewis_, _A Severe Mercy_ (by Sheldon Vanauken), and _Letters to Children_.	2003-11-18

The buyers' remorse set in a few seconds after I clicked the button to complete the purchase of this book.  Do I have to buy *every* book about C.S. Lewis that comes down the pike?  And especially *this* one, from an author I'd never even heard of, who teaches at some obscure evangelical college in Texas?  When the book arrived in the mail and I saw how physically slight it was, my misgivings, if anything, deepened.  Then I started to read.<br />Markos strikes me as a genuine kindred spirit of Lewis.  His prose is poetic.  He eschews the obfuscation that is so rampant in academic discourse in general and in literary criticism in particular.  He seems to be a man of strong, and relatively conservative, religious conviction, yet with a remarkable knack for understanding and appreciating a variety of people and their worldviews.  While not viewing originality as the be-all and end-all of existence, he avoids the trite.  He has done a fine job with this book.	2003-09-06

This book was recommended to me as a very nice introduction to quantum mechanics for the mathematically-inclined.  It looks like I'll be awaiting the publication of the new edition of Sudbery's text instead, because, at least for me, this book didn't quite end up filling the bill.  It's true that, unlike so many popular introductions to quantum theory, Hughes' book doesn't shy away from mathematics.  The mathematics for me was fine (although I wonder what a person who'd had &quot;only high school algebra&quot; would make of the derivatives and integrals that show up unannounced).  It's in trying to make sense of what the mathematics is supposed to be modelling that I felt that this book lost a star.  (How much of the problem is due to the author's exposition and how much is due to my shortcomings as a reader is something I'm not prepared to judge.)<br />Again, this is a good book, but I have no idea where people are coming from when they write &quot;this is not only the best book ever written, but also the best book that ever will be written&quot;.	2003-08-28

(Fool me twice, shame on me.)  I'd read another book annotated by Gardner before, so I knew something about what his notes were like.  Still, I thought, who better to explicate the puns, colloquialisms, and mathematical, logical, and philosophical references in _Alice_ than one of the great polymaths of our time, a connoisseur of puzzles, and an aficionado of Victorian literature?  Plus, it's hard to deny that _The Definitive Edition_ is a handsome one.<br />Well, Gardner has really outdone himself this time.  The notes go on and on and on, eclipsing the actual text in length.  While Clavin might interrupt a conversation on the Bermuda Triangle to point out the little-known fact that it's really shaped like a tetrazidrhomboid, Gardner thinks that when a character uses an idiomatic expression involving ferrets it would be relevant to mention a get-together that ferret owners recently held in New York City's Central Park.  Much of the inside information Gardner does provide is along the lines of telling us that this character is based on Alice Liddell's third cousin, once removed, or that that character is named after Dodgson's pet gerbil.<br />I think Gardner may have finally succeeded in turning me off of annotated editions for good.	2003-06-27

Brown does have some useful things to say, and his analysis is more balanced than that of many commentators on the science wars, but in places that analysis is rather shallow.  It seems to me, for example, that the philosophical difficulties of naturalism would be something worth addressing by Brown, but he gives those difficulties short shrift.<br />Brown is just as capable as the extremists at dismissing those he disagrees with as \\"mushy-minded\\", \\"bad scientists\\" whose views are \\"laughable\\" and whose sanity should be doubted.  All those who think moral norms might have divine origin?  According to Brown, they're \\"naively religious\\".  All those who disagree with Brown about capital punishment?  According to Brown, they just must not have studied the matter as much as he has. (For Brown, this is apparently an issue on which it is impossible for there to be an honest, informed difference of opinion.)  As someone who sympathizes with both Brown and Norman Levitt on many issues but disagrees with them each on others, I have to say that it's a lot more fun to be insulted by Levitt because he does it with such style!  (Incidentally, Brown's analysis of Gross and Levitt's book only seems to make sense if Levitt is on the political Right.  My reading of Levitt's _Prometheus Bedeviled_ leads me to believe that that is far from the case.)<br />One last item:  Brown writes:  \\"Most people could achieve a high-level understanding of any branch of science, but only if several years have been devoted to its intense study.\\"  I'm not sure whether Brown classifies mathematics as a branch of science, but I see no more evidence that sufficient training could provide most people with a high-level understanding of mathematics than that sufficient training could provide most people with the ability to high jump 7 feet.  I used to tell my students that intense study would undoubtedly make them successful; after seeing several hard-workers earn D's, I stopped saying that.em successful; after seeing several hard-workers earn D's, I stopped saying that.	2003-05-03

(But, of course, translators can't be blamed for the nutty things these French(wo)men say, because their words apparently don't make any more sense in the original. _Fashionable Nonsense_ itself was originally published in France as _Impostures Intellectuelles_.) If my math students wrote like this, I'd probably not only fail them but also arrange for them to receive psychiatric treatment.<br />Why only 4 stars? While the book starts out fun, after a couple hundred pages it gets a little bit tiresome. You only have to read so many page-long excerpts of gibberish followed by commentary on the order of \\"Well, that didn't make any sense\\" to get the point. Sokal and Bricmont's attempt to be patient, fair, and scholarly is understandable and laudable, but I have to say I that I found myself longing for the poison-pen approach that Norman Levitt took in _Prometheus Bedeviled_.	2003-04-12

(I'm midway through his _Logic, Logic, and Logic_ right now.)  I think Cambridge University Press is a wonderful company.  (I own 25 of their titles.)  I think the subject matter of this book is fascinating, and I'd probably agree with 95% of the nice things reviewers say about this book.  But it is aggravating to spend good money on a book with as many typos as this one has.  The reader of a math book should be expected to have a pencil handy to work out details, not to correct errors.<br />This fourth edition is a major revision of the third edition, which is the edition that pre-2002 reviews (including those excerpted on the fourth edition's back cover) are talking about.  Boolos is now deceased and had no part in the revisions, and I think the fourth edition has suffered as a result.<br />As a sampling of the typos, consider what we find starting halfway through Chapter 7 and proceeding through Chapter 9:  In the proof of Corollary 7.6, the word &quot;smallest&quot; is omitted in the 4th sentence, and in 9 different places the argument x has been dropped from the function c (p. 78).  Example 7.10 has the erroneous condition x&lt;x (p. 79).  The definition of &quot;semirecursive&quot; refers to an n-place recursive relation R but shows an (n+1)-place relation (p. 81).  In the proof of part (d) of Corollary 7.15, R_2y is written in place of R_2x (p.82).  In the proof of Proposition 7.17, the v in the definition of g should be a w (p. 83).  In Section 8.1, newleft_1 is claimed to be id^2_1 even though it has 3 inputs, r^* is claimed to be equal to 2r^*+1 rather than 2r+1 (p. 90), an undefined variable l is written in place of p, the word &quot;be&quot; is omitted before &quot;subsumed&quot;, and the formula for valu(r) has a superfluous &quot;+1&quot; (p. 91).  In 2 places the entry function is written as &quot;entry&quot; instead of &quot;ent&quot; (p. 92).  The definition of &quot;universal&quot; function talks about a one-place function f but shows an n-place function, the 3-place function stdh is show with only 2 arguments, and a nonexistent Theorem 5.5 is referenced (p. 95).  The proof of Corollary 8.8 says A is a set of F rather than a set of x (p. 97).  The abstract of Chapter 9 talks about &quot;notions pertaining formulas&quot; (p. 101).  Quantified variables in Table 9-1 are erroneously shown as subscripts (p. 102).  The identity symbol is said not to be &quot;treated like other the nonlogical predicates&quot; (p. 104).  There are superfluous copies of the words &quot;also&quot;, &quot;with&quot; (p. 106), &quot;zero&quot; (p. 107), &quot;every&quot; (p. 109), and &quot;that&quot; (p. 111) inserted in the text, while a copy of &quot;notation&quot; is missing (p. 108).

In the essay \\"Sorrow--The Pledge of Joy\\", George MacDonald wrote:  \\"Out upon such miserable theologians as . . . so cut and pare the words of the Lord as to take the very life from them, quenching all their glory and colour\\".  You won't find these words in the edited version of this essay in _Life Essential_; in my opinion, Hein has so cut and pared the words of MacDonald as to take the very life from them, quenching not all, but much, of their glory and color.<br /><br />In the introduction, Hein warns us that the editing has taken place, resulting in about half of MacDonald's words being discarded.  The ostensible reason is that MacDonald tended to use florid language that is awkward to the modern ear, and that he tended to repeat himself.  Search the Internet for MacDonald's original texts and compare them to Hein's editions and see if you don't agree with me that the language Hein cut was often glorious.  And when you examine the deletions it will be obvious that elimination of repetition can't explain all of them.  On the contrary, the deleted passages often make points not made by the surviving text, points that perhaps made Hein uncomfortable (like, in \\"Sorrow--The Pledge of Joy\\", the eternal nature of human relationships:  \\"A heaven without human love it were inhuman, and yet more undivine to desire; it ought not to be desired by any being made in the image of God.\\")<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy the lovely Johannesen editions of MacDonald's original works instead.	2002-06-17

Lewis before reading this one, the author was able to highlight several themes in Lewis's writings that I hadn't really noticed before.  It did seem to me, however, that he took an unnecessarily large amount of space to make his points, and no one will confuse Kort's writing with Lewis's own vibrant prose.  (I think this book must have set a record for most occurrences of the word &quot;militate&quot;.)  This is not the first time that I've read a socio-cultural analysis that has seemed to drain much of the life, energy, and interest out of its subject.<br />Kort seems very sympathetic to Lewis; he is less sympathetic with typical Lewis fans (although he is unfailingly polite in expressing that lack of sympathy).  Kort makes sure to use the shibboleths of political correctness--&quot;racism&quot;, &quot;sexism&quot;, and &quot;homophobia&quot;--without taking the time to define their meaning or to justify their use.<br />The book's concluding chapter is the most interesting and the most controversial.  Kort seems to think that the most important way to continue the Lewis legacy is not to appreciate and propagate Lewis's ideas but to do the work in our day and society that would be analogous to the work Lewis did in his day and society.  So, what would be analogous?  Kort writes that &quot;[o]ne advantage that our own time and place give us over Lewis is that we will not be tempted, as perhaps he was, by nostalgia for a Christian culture&quot;, and he proposes the celebration of diversity as a major thrust of a proper modern Lewisian project.  Kort's description of a C.S. Lewis for our times, makes me less interested in awaiting his appearance and more interested in reading the writings of the old one.	2002-01-15

Nevertheless, I would rank _Latin Letters_ relatively low in importance among Lewis's books, somewhere below _Letters to an American Lady_.  The letters are not terribly &quot;meaty&quot;, and most of the substantial comments in the letters were also made by Lewis elsewhere.  The book is only a little over a hundred pages, and taking into account the fact that roughly half those pages are taken up by the original Latin and that the remaining half has a generous amount of white space, there's really not a whole lot there.	2001-11-01

The problem is not that I don't find philosophy interesting; I own about 40 books on philosophy and tend to spend a lot of my spare time reading them.<br />I gave the first book in this series (_Seinfeld and Philosophy_) 4 stars.  The authors of that book had meaningful things to say about the philosophical aspects of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, but they seemed to think it would be hilarious if they liberally and randomly inserted phrases like &quot;not that there's anything wrong with that&quot; into their essays, and that got old really quick.  (To get an idea how annoying this can be, think of your acquaintances who can't seem to carry on a conversation without repeating dialogue from _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_.)<br />In _The Simpsons and Philosophy_, the editors have managed to keep the cuteness under control, but the authors don't establish too many non-obvious connections between philosophy and the show.  Part of the problem is that some of them don't seem to be very familiar with the program and with popular culture, in general.  For example, the author of one essay asserts that Maude Flanders was killed at a football game and that the running character on the old Letterman show was the &quot;equalizer guy&quot;, and seems unaware that the song &quot;Jazzman&quot; that was featured in the episode about the death of Bleeding Gums Murphy was an old Carole King hit.  Another essay reveals the shocking fact that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; does not, to the essay's author's dismay, push a consistent Marxist agenda.<br />Several of the essays make only tangential and superficial reference to the Simpsons.  It's hard to suppress the impression that many of the authors are junior faculty members who jumped at the chance to pad their CV's by taking an old essay of theirs and dressing it up with token reference to the Simpsons.

I am not much of a fan of old typefaces, old books, or their facsimiles, but the physical beauty of this duplex edition of these hundred year old books reflects well the beauty of the teachings inscribed on its pages.<br />Among the essays in _Hope of the Gospel_ is &quot;Sorrow, the Pledge of Joy&quot;, which I consider to be one of the all-time masterpieces of devotional literature.  Anyone who can read it without weeping must have lived a life much different from mine.  This essay appears in a heavily edited form in Rolland Hein's _Life Essential:  The Hope of the Gospel_; buy the Johannesen's edition to enjoy this and other essays in their full unedited glory.	2001-05-30

Problems start at a low level. Typographical errors of a sort impossible to miss (e.g., missing or superfluous words) appear every two or three pages and suggest that the manuscript was not carefully proofread. I could live with Jones' discursive style in his earlier books, but in this one entire paragraphs are repeated verbatim. (Compare page 368 to page 522.)<br />The most serious problems in this book involve content. I am sympathetic with the author's thesis that modern society is harmed by sexual promiscuity and that nowadays sex is frequently used as a tool to manipulate others. Jones' criticism of Kinsey appears, in particular, to be on target. But in an effort to tie together the various vignettes that make up this book, Jones seems to lend undue credence to various conspiracy theories and to overreach in the conclusions he draws from the available evidence. The author's denial of the reality of mental illness is not the only part of this book in which he comes across as more Catholic than the Pope. (See John Paul II's 11/30/96 address to the Pontifical Council for Pastoral Assistance to Health-Care Workers.)	2001-01-24

The sort of book it is is a detailed account of how various persons in the American historical profession over the last century or so have viewed \\"historical objectivity\\".<br />I think that just about everyone who reads this book will come away with a feeling that \\"objectivity\\" is, at the very least, problematic--much more problematic than many critics of \\"subjective\\" historians seem to believe. Someone seeking a philosophical critique of \\"objectivity\\" can probably find what he's looking for in the many sources mentioned in Novick's footnotes.<br />I started reading this book with a little trepidation, because someone had mentioned to me that Novick has radical political views, but his political biases really aren't apparent for most of the book. About 4/5 of the way through, however, (when he's worked his way up to the time of McCarthyism, Reaganomics, etc.) you can tell that he's beginning to talk about things he has deep feelings about. In the preface, Novick had said that he felt that sticking \\"[sic]\\"s all over in quotations when it was clear what the author meant was \\"mean-spirited\\" (p. xii), and the book is remarkably free of \\"[sic]\\"s. But Novick does use \\"[sic]\\" in some rather curious places (i.e., where there is no mistake in spelling, grammar, or usage) when the person he's quoting is expressing conservative views. (See pp. 450, 463.) Novick also laments how, in the 80s, Reaganomics \\"deliberately redistribute[d] income from the poorest to the richest segments of society.\\" (p. 466) Well, that's one way to look at it. Another would be that the government decided not to confiscate as much of the rich segment's money as it had been doing. Or maybe Novick wasn't talking about Reaganomics at all; maybe he was referring to state lotteries!laments how, in the 80s, Reaganomics \\"deliberately redistribute[d] income from the poorest to the richest segments of society.\\" (p. 466) Well, that's one way to look at it.

I've read a lot of Chesterton in the last year or so, and I guess I have mixed feelings about his work in general and this book in particular.  Chesterton provides extraordinarily beautiful word pictures.  I feel like taking a trip to England just to see if the real English sky can match a fraction of the descriptions Chesterton gives it.  (Smog abatement measures may have made a fair comparison impossible.)  Chesterton's love of paradox can be fun, but it may be best to take it in small doses for optimal enjoyment.  The Father Brown stories are short enough that the character development suffers in comparison with G.K.'s novels; on the other hand, these stories benefit from omission of some of the more bizarre flights of fancy found in his longer works.<br />Now for the footnotes.  I've been reading Martin Gardner for a long time.  As a young boy, I spent many hours in the local library reading and enjoying his columns in archived copies of Scientific American.  I must say that I find his footnotes in this book somewhat obtrusive.  They seem to give away too much of the plot too early, and are probably, therefore, best for a second reading of the text.  Gardner has deep philosophical differences with Chesterton, and although he does a fairly good job of restraining himself, there are occasions when he apparently can't resist giving us his two cents.  I found that a little annoying.  The footnotes in the Ignatius edition of _The Man Who Knew to Much_ are an example of what I would have preferred in this book.	2000-11-27

Current fans will enjoy an insider's view of the band as it was in the mid 90s.  Those who miss the way U2 was in the early to mid 80s may find some comfort in learning that Bono's father appears to feel the same way.  In the book's last chapter, Mr. Hewson shares a letter Bono wrote when he was young and idealistic.  It's hard to imagine today's Bono writing of the music business that &quot;never before have so many lost and sorrowful people gathered in one place pretending they're having a good time.&quot;  This letter alone will be worth the price of the book for  many former fans, who will find it heartbreaking.	2000-10-31

I've seen a handful of copies of this book from a variety of outlets; all of those copies had their white covers soiled.  This is unfortunate, because inside those covers is the most beautifully designed book on C.S. Lewis I've ever seen.  The many black-and-white photographs of Lewis family life and of the places important to Lewis's youth are striking, and the placement of those photos in the text is well done.  The text itself appears to have a few editing glitches, but it comes from someone with a deep appreciation of Lewis's work, and it is hard not to be touched by the story she tells.	2000-10-23

Jones' interest in horror stems from the way he thinks it reflects vital facts about the culture within which it is produced.  Some of his interpretations seem like a bit of a stretch, but no more so than those by modernist critics.  I am neither a Catholic nor a conspiracy theorist, but I think that, despite its flaws, Jones' analysis of some of the negative consequences of the Enlightenment is valuable.  He is a skilled writer, and this book is a quick read.	2000-09-26

The author, Norman Levitt, has many valuable insights, and he is an extraordinarily eloquent writer.  I share the  author's profession (mathematics) and much of his disdain for social  constructivism.  Although I am a conservative, believing Christian and  Levitt is an outspoken atheist, I thought that his, sometimes pointed,  criticism of believers was generally tolerable.  He discusses the  teleological presuppositions of the irreligious as well and is willing to  spread the blame around for what he perceives as the devaluation of science  in modern society.<br />My enthusiasm for _Prometheus Bedeviled_ began to wane  towards the end of the book.  Levitt's thesaurus seemed to run dry, as we  read about the &quot;clotted&quot; prose of the postmodernists for the nth  time.  I also began to notice how often Levitt resorted to labeling the  arguments of his opponents as &quot;rants&quot; or &quot;raves&quot; as a  means of dismissing them without, I think, giving them the attention they  deserve.  That is a rhetorical device I don't care for.  Some cheap shots  Levitt apparently couldn't resist.  Consider, for example, his observation  that &quot;the core ideology of the Republican party is essentially  plutocratic, that the central aim of the party is to preserve and advance  the interests of a rather small fraction of wealthy Americans.&quot;  Even  setting aside the questionable accuracy of his analysis of Republican  economic policy, Levitt conveniently understates the influence of social  conservatism in the GOP.  In any case, these are the words of a polemicist,  not a scientist.<br />Rather than a full-fledged argument, Levitt presents an  intriguing sketch of an argument.  Perhaps this is to avoid pedantry, and  it does make for a very readable text, but I think it leaves too many gaps.  The all-important word &quot;science&quot; is left undefined, and, as far  as I can tell, Levitt never tells us the theory upon which he bases his,  often resounding, moral judgments.  I will not demand that Levitt accept  Ivan Karamazov's decree that &quot;without God, everything is  allowed,&quot; but in light of Levitt's atheism, it would be nice if he  clarified where his &quot;oughts&quot; are coming from.<br />The last chapter  strikes me as the least clear and the most controversial.  Levitt seems to  be arguing for granting the scientific establishment a prominent official  presence in government and society, but I'm not sure what exactly he has in  mind.  Few readers of _That Hideous Strength_ will be able to read this  chapter without thinking of N.I.C.E.  Levitt himself says that &quot;[t]he  notion of setting apart a restricted class of Americans to sit in judgment  on all the others is spooky and obnoxious.&quot;  I agree.far  as I can tell, Levitt never tells us the theory upon which he bases his,  often resounding, moral judgments.

There is, however, much in its pages to edify persons of good will, no  matter what their religious affiliations.  Far from merely listing virtues,  Hinckley describes virtues he thinks are in short supply, explains how  their increased practice would benefit the nation and the world, and  instills the reader with hope that, in fact, things can get better.  The  picture he paints of a world in which virtue prevails reminds me of the  depiction of Shalom in one of my other favorite books: _Not the Way It's  Supposed to Be_ by Cornelius Plantinga, Jr.	2000-03-25

For  example, I learned that on April 7, 1847, the lead company of pioneers at  Winter Quarters, Nebraska, set out for . . . Iowa?  I learned that (contra  D&amp;C 20) teachers can ordain deacons.  I learned that Roger Reid  resigned from BYU, but Brian Evenson was fired.  I learned that the Book of  Abraham introduces the doctrine of polygamy. (Where?)  I learned that Stan  Larson has been excommunicated.  (If that's true, it was by far the  quietest excommunication of a Mormon intellectual in recent years.)  I  learned that Thomas S. Monson, one of the most enthusiastic University of  Utah supporters among Church leaders, actually did his undergraduate work  at archrival BYU.<br />More irritating than inconsequential inaccuracies were  what I perceived as misrepresentations through selective presentation of  the truth.  Eugene England's Abelardianism is presented as the Mormon  theory of the Atonement, despite hundreds of statements by Church leaders  to the effect that there was a metaphysical price to be paid for our sins,  and Jesus paid it.  A seriously-flawed critique of Mormon appreciation of  C.S. Lewis that was written by a teenager is presented as authoritative,  while opposing viewpoints by seasoned LDS religious and literary scholars  are given short shrift. Perceived problems with the historicity of the Book  of Mormon are mentioned, but the Ostlings falsely assert that defenders of  the Book of Mormon &quot;offer no explanation&quot; to resolve them.<br />I  believe that Mormon America was written without malice on the part of the  authors, but their own theological predispositions have prevented them from  presenting a fair and even-handed portrait of Mormonism.from  presenting a fair and even-handed portrait of Mormonism.	2000-02-15
