We read this book with our daughter when she was in pre-K and Kindergarten many, many times.

I think it's a lot harder to grow up today than it used to be, and I'm glad Fred Rogers is there to help ease the way.	2002-10-26

I've got a bookshelf full of Calvin Trillin's books and have been reading him for nearly my entire adult life.  His wry observations and dead-on satire intersect with a sweetness that makes his writing better than many other humorists.<br />Even though we live in a post-September 11th world that lionizes ex-mayor Guliani, the quirks in his personality that many New Yorkers came to know are satirized wonderfully well in this slim volume, which boasts a unique premise and funny descriptions on every page.  Almost everyone I know who lives in NYC has a Calvin Trillin anecdote to share, of his wry observations at PTA meetings or his gustatory delight on display while eating some spicy food.<br />Reading Trillin is like being in Manhattan  - and that's even when he's talking about D.C. or Kansas City.  Tepper is well worth the trip, and you don't even have to leave your living room.	2002-02-01

With releases of each subsequent historical romance by Catherine<br />Coulter, I feel as though I'm in a smaller and smaller minority - I<br />still like her! Though The Scottish Bride won't go down as my favorite<br />Coulter by a long shot, it earns a respectable B- from me - I liked it<br />somewhat less than last year's The Courtship, but it's still a<br />recommended read.<br />This is the fourth and final book in her<br />regency-set historicals about the Sherbrooke family. The hero goes<br />against type. Tysen Sherbrooke is a dour vicar, a widower with three<br />children who travels to Scotland after he inherits a barony and<br />castle. He is not like his rakish brothers and brother-in-law, who<br />starred in the previous titles in this series.<br />Tysen rescues Mary<br />Rose Fordyce, the local bastard, from the clutches of a local man who,<br />with the blessing of her uncle, will do anything, including rape,<br />apparently, to force her into marriage with him. Tysen is outraged at<br />this turn of events, and is surprised as well to discover he has<br />feelings for Mary Rose, feelings that don't conform to his<br />piousness.<br />It's one thing to read a romance where the heroine<br />reforms a rake, it's another altogether to read a romance where the<br />heroine brings chaotic light into the ordered presence of a prudish<br />and seemingly humorless hero. As impressive as Mary Rose is in light<br />of her Untouchable status, Tysen's wavering between what he sees as<br />his religious duty and the joy he experiences with Mary Rose is<br />terrific. And, to Coulter's credit, the appearance of characters from<br />the earlier books in this series did not detract from this book's<br />stars - they provided both comic relief and a kick in the pants to<br />Tysen when necessary. Not all the secondary characters are as<br />well-drawn, however; Mary Rose's mother is particularly problematic,<br />but I found Tysen's daughter Meggie engaging, though some may find her<br />irritating.<br />There are some wonderfully funny scenes..., and some<br />with a strong emotional charge. Still, this is Tysen's book, and those<br />readers looking for a different kind of hero should enjoy it.<br />TTFN,<br />Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher, All About RomanceTysen's book, and those readers looking for a different kind of hero should enjoy it. <br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books <br />Publisher, All About Romance	2001-01-19

Although I'm not much of a cook, I do know a winning recipe when I read one, and THE TROUBLE WITH MARY is simply delightful.  When Mary gets a bad review for her new Italian restaurant, she pays a little visit to sportswriter Dan, who is filling in as food critic.  He's no Oscar, though, and is immediately attracted to Mary, even when he believes her food has poisoned his son.  Though accusations fly initially, Mary and Dan begin to date, and Mary's hopes for finally getting zinged look promising.  If only her nosey and noisy family didn't interfere in her life so much.  If only Dan weren't so opposed to women working - it's what broke up his marriage.  If only Mary weren't so opposed to settling down, which is what Dan determines he wants.<br />Millie Criswell's first single title contemporary romance is lots of fun - Mary's thoughts are often out-and-out hysterical, and the personalities of her mother and klepto grandmother are rendered wonderfully.  Dan's son is not the traditional cardboard-cutout-kid so often filling the pages of romance novels.  And, the love scenes will tingle down to your toes.<br />While THE TROUBLE WITH MARY is a good read, it's not a great one.  Dan's old-fashioned attitude toward women working seems somewhat archaic, and even though he gets past it, it was definitely there.  It's hard to pin-point other problems with the book, so I guess it just comes down to this: some books are fun to read, and that's all.  For me, fun to read is good enough.  If it's good enough for you too, give this one a try.  If you do, I think you'll enjoy it, and will look forward to the sequel, featuring Mary's brother, who's a Catholic Father and her best friend, ... Annie.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books  Publisher, All About Romance	2001-01-06

I always find it exciting to be swept away by a book I didn't expect much from, and this &quot;forced engagement&quot; romance didn't look promising in the year 2001.  But author Christy Ridgway's THIS PERFECT KISS turned out to be the perfect book to kick off a new year of romance reading, and provided not one but two romances to savor.<br />Millionaire Rory Kincaid will be running for the Senate and has worked his entire life to separate himself from the scandals surrounding his parents and grandparents.  Jilly Skye was raised by a grandmother whose daughter was nothing but a scandal; Jilly does not know that love can exist without pain and coercion.  When the two meet and are forced into an engagement in order to prevent a new scandal from sullying the Kincaid name, the attraction threatens both Jilly and Rory down to the core.<br />THIS PERFECT KISS is an intense read.  Both Jilly and Rory are fully-fleshed characters filled with internal contradictions.  Rory's four year old...Aunt, who acts as catalyst to the story, both for Jilly and Rory and the secondary romance that develops between two other characters, brings both humor and pathos to the  book.<br />I don't grant Desert Isle Keeper status very often - lately only once or twice a year - and this book was on the cusp.  It settled on the B+ rather than the A- side because, as good as the story eventually became, it took just a little too long to fully engage me.  Still, for readers looking for strong characters, terrific chemistry, and a strong balance between lighter and darker elements, I strongly recommend THIS PERFECT KISS.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books Publisher, All About Romance	2001-01-06

Elizabeth Lowell's Chain Lightning is one of her better series titles.<br />While the prose is definitely purple at times, she writes the<br />&quot;steadfast heroine&quot; better than most other romance authors.<br />By that, I mean those heroines who are quietly strong although they<br />initially come off as weak to their heroes.  When her books work, one<br />of the reasons they do is when that &quot;ahah&quot; moment happens to<br />her heroes, when they realize that the heroine has actually been<br />incredibly brave in facing her demons.<br />That's exactly what happens<br />in Chain Lightning, a romance about Amanda Blythe and Damon Sutter.<br />Amanda's boss is also Damon's aunt, and she decides to throw the two<br />together on a three-week vacation on an island in Australia's Great<br />Barrier Reef.  Great idea, if Amanda hadn't nearly drowned in the<br />plane crash that killed her bum of a husband and their unborn child.<br />Great idea, if Damon could handle a woman not as strong as<br />himself.<br />But thrown together these two are, and as the sexual<br />tension increases, so does Damon eventually learn the truth about the<br />seemingly waifish Amanda.  His &quot;ahah&quot; moment is both<br />effective and affecting, and the relationship these two forge as a<br />result is very touching.  As author Lowell tends to do, there's always<br />one more hurdle to jump before an HEA ending, and this one is one of<br />her most poignant endings - up there with the endings in Too Hot to<br />Handle and Love Song for a Raven.<br />Elizabeth Lowell is one of the few<br />authors I read who writes seemingly endless love scenes - her series<br />titles always seem to include one that goes on forever - but they<br />often work for her, conveying in actions what the characters are<br />unable to convey with words.  Chain Lightning is no exception, and if<br />the reader can get past some of the corny dialogue (her heroes often<br />seem to have horrible nicknames for their heroines), there's a good<br />time to be had...	2000-10-03

I had a sense of how strongly this book was affecting me when I began to bawl like a baby after my daughter shouted at me regarding a pair of socks.  My confirmation of the power of THE FIRST TIME came when I finished it just now - sitting at my kitchen table, crying so loudly I scared the cat.<br />This is an amazing work of fiction about a woman who is diagnosed with ALS and discovers that the worst year of her life is also the best year of her life.  Mattie's husband of 16-years has cheated on her through their entire marriage.  She knows, but he doesn't know she knows.  He leaves her for another woman after she has a car accident, but when she is diagnosed with ALS, he moves back into the house to care for her and help care for their teen-age daughter.<br />Mattie does not want the end of her existence to come with a man who only pities her.  She gives Jason an ultimatum: &quot;either pretend you love me or get out.&quot;  Being a fundamentally good person, he decides to pretend, the result of which is that he finally gives of himself to Mattie, revealing things about his painful past he'd never before been able to share.<br />Even though the reader knows Mattie is going to die, reading this book is NOT like waiting for a train crash you know is coming.  There are too many questions the readers wants answered.  Will Mattie and Jason find peace in themselves?  Is it possible for them to find the love they missed during their marriage?  How will he and their daughter carry on when she's gone?<br />Author Fielding has crafted a novel with wonderful characterizations.  Mattie and Jason are three-dimensional people who seem real - they don't always do the right thing, and some of the right things they do get them into trouble.  I strongly recommend THE FIRST TIME for any reader looking for a well-written story of redemption and the bittersweet taste of people given a second chance at love.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance	2000-09-29

As a romance reader with &quot;peasant&quot; tastes, I looked forward to  reading By Possession, the second in a trilogy of stand-alone medieval  romances with some trepidation.  The reviewer who raved about the first  title (By Arrangement) at the site I publish, All About Romance, has far  more sophisticated romance taste buds than I - what if I wasn't  &quot;up&quot; to the book?  Well, that worry was for naught; author Hunter  makes 14th century England come alive in a manner few authors have done for  me.  For all the historical richness of the story, the romantic aspect is  never lost, and the poignancy of the seemingly untenable love between  scarred knight Addis de Valence and serf-born Moira Falkner is truly  touching.  By Possession is a medieval romance brimming with romance,  intrigue, and excitement.  It should well satisfy not only readers who  demand a high level of historical accuracy, but readers who look to  historical romance to learn about history.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes  Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance	2000-09-13

Tyberius Augustus Evans is gorgeous, brilliant, rich, kind to animals, small children and kooks, sexy, eccentric, and secure enough in himself to  fall utterly and completely in love. This is a fantasy hero - no real man  could ever compete with Tyber. There's no angst here, no dark and brooding  secrets, simply the perfect man.<br />When an author writes a romance with a  hero such as this, the heroine has to be handled correctly. I mean, what  we've read before tells us that if she falls too hard and too fast, there  will be no conflict and therefore no story. Did Dara Joy follow that  steadfast rule? Not on your life. The set-up for Zanita, our heroine, is  that she's never experienced fulfillment because she's always held herself  back, never allowed herself to become befuddled. Her best friend has  advised her that she'll know when it's the real thing when she jumps in  feet first.<br />Which is precisely what happens; Zanita falls for Tyber  asap, and before she knows it, she's completely befuddled. Ah, you say, if  she's befuddled, does that make her too stupid to live? Well, I certainly  didn't think so. She didn't get herself into situations she couldn't get  out of, although the hero's mastery prevented many of the situations from  getting out of control (just another reason to love him!)<br />Humorous  romances require quirkiness of character. Zanita, as Tyber puts it, is a  genius in non-linear thinking. Perhaps I relate to her; my husband says I  get from A to C via Q. My synapses fire differently than most. So do  Zanita's (okay, so her name is a bit on the zany side, but I can live with  that!).<br />So, does her befuddled-ness annoy our hero? In many romances, it  does, and that's where the humor generally is found - think Bewitching or A  Basket of Wishes. In this book, Tyber knows Zanita's non-linear thinking is  what is drawing him in to her and he's secure enough to go along for the  ride. She knows he's eccentric but is living her friend's advice - she's  jumped in without thinking, and for once, her love life is working. There's  great humor there.<br />So we've got a great hero, a befuddled heroine,  humor. . . did I mention great sex? Well, sort of, because Zanita, who  never experienced fulfillment, is fulfilled quite a bit. From what I  gather, Dara Joy's other books are quite a bit more explicit than this one,  but, believe me, Tyber's brilliance isn't limited to the laboratory. Not  only that, he knows Zanita is the one for him, and the way he brings her  along is masterful.<br />So, we've got a great hero, a befuddled heroine,  humor, great sex. . . where's the conflict? We all know that there has to  be conflict for a romance to work. Without that tension, it's a bore,  right? I mean, haven't we read books where the hero and heroine get along  so well that it's like talking a walk in the garden? Well, it's a lovely  walk, but after about an hour, you start to wonder, &quot;Okay, this is  fine, but what else is there?&quot;<br />Dara Joy created a small amount of  conflict for Tyber and Zanita by creating conflict within Zanita, who has a  hard time taking Tyber's commitment to her at face value. And, the author  created external conflict as well - a problem and a mystery for the two  characters to resolve that falls outside their relationship. It is, in  essence, what keeps them together initially.  The author also creates a bit  of extra fun in the characters of Mills and Gregor, whose one meeting is  filled with some of the best bickering I've ever read - I look forward to  reading their romance one day!<br />This romance is a wonderful piece of  fluff, and if you have the requisite sense of humor to enjoy fluff, I  strongly recommend High Energy.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher, All  About Romance<br />(This review drawn from the October 20, 1991 issue of  Laurie's News &amp; Views column now known as At the Back Fence, at All  About Romance)vice - she's  jumped in without thinking, and for once, her love life is working.

Tyber Evans, hero of this book and its precursor, High Energy, has been my favorite romance hero for nearly three years.  That's how long I looked  forward to reading High Intensity, btw, because I knew from interviewing  the author that she'd planned a Nick and Nora type sequel to High Energy  for some time.  Unfortunately, High Intensity didn't live up to my  expectations.<br />Readers do not have to have read the earlier book in order  to read High Intensity, but since I recommend that title over this one, I  hope you will.  Yes, there are hints at what went before - characters and  memories and the like.  But not knowing those characters before hand and  not having been on those memories won't make this reading experience worse.  What's more important, however, is that they don't make it any better.<br />The author manages to remind readers of the type of quirky detail that  made High Energy such fun (there's even a hint or two of her Matrix of  Destiny series), but those reminders don't make High Intensity more fun.  And secondary characters Mills and Gregor, who were delightfully introduced  in High Energy, make a return appearance here.  Their sexually charged  bickering in High Energy reads more like two junior high school kids  embarrassed to admit they like someone of the opposite sex in High  Intensity.  This was a *major* disappointment.<br />There is a lot more  lovemaking going on in this installment of the series, but it's not nearly  as sexy as the few erotically charged scenes in the first book.  The  mystery that drives the story is not particularly engaging, and while I've  had a soft spot for Tyber for going on three years, I'm now in the market  for a new favorite hero.<br />I won't bother to describe the plot - you can  find that in any number of places, including, I'm sure, other amazon.com  reviews on this page.  What you get from me instead, is a word from the  faithful.  High Energy was and is my favorite Dara Joy novel.  If you read  High Intensity without having read High Energy, I'm afraid you'll wonder  what the fuss is all about.  And the sad part is, you'll have missed a  better, far better, read.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher, All About  Romanceead  High Intensity without having read High Energy, I'm afraid you'll wonder  what the fuss is all about.

From all the hoopla this book received, I expected to read a  fabulous book, though certainly a strange one.  Well, the strange part is  true, but a fabulous book this is not.<br />During a pancake dinner for  therapists, Tom has an out-of-body experience/nervous breakdown.  Told in  first person narrative, The Verificationist explores what Tom's physical  body is going through, as well as where his &quot;out of body&quot; body is  experiencing.  Although the book didn't do for me what I'd expected, some  of the passages were a rather interesting if depressing glimpse into the  mind of a middle-aged man.  If focusing on neuroses and insecurities is the  kind of thing you like, then Tom's recollection of the discussion his wife  had while he was going to the bathroom should be of interest.  I'm almost  embarrassed to admit I was drawn into it myself.  Another scene, wherein  Tom spies two of his colleagues engaged in what he believes are the  preliminary battle lines drawn before sexual congress, is also  fascinating.<br />All in all, though, this book added up to far less than the  sum of its parts.  Yes, the premise was unique, and while it did provide  the occasional insight, more often than not the writing was self-indulgent.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance	2000-07-25

I for one am glad she made the move if that means more readers will read her books.  In  Circle of Three, author Gaffney does what she does best - creates complex  characters who might not always be likable, but who are true to themselves.  They don't act according to the plot written for them; they drive the plot  by the force of their personalities.<br />The three women whose voices narrate  this book are bound by blood and gender in a manner only women can be.  Grandmother, mother, and daughter, Dana, Carrie, and Ruth are connected  through their actions and the men in their lives in an honest and emotional  story. The plotting is inventive (the ark subplot is funny at times and  poignant at others) and the writing is intimate.  The reunion and  developing romance between Carrie and her first love, Jess, is quite  lovely, although her choices do not always have the impact she'd hoped for.<br />This can be a difficult book to read, however, precisely for the same  reasons it is worthwhile.

The jacket of this hardcover novel is filled with terrific reviews from the likes of Publishers Weekly, which called it &quot;wickedly funny and very sexy.&quot;  They must have read a different book than the I one I was  sent, because while it may be wicked, it is also boring and yucky.<br />All of  us probably have a friend or relative whose behavior we accept only because  we care for the person.  We would never pull the stunts they pull, but we  don't judge them because that would be, well, judgmental.  Having never met  the fictional protagonist in Playing Away, I can be as judgmental about  Connie Green as I feel.  She's selfish and doesn't deserve half of what she  has in life.  And while she may have decided to play around on her pretty  terrific husband, Luke, because she's bored, she sure spread the wealth -  this is a very boring book.<br />It's not the infidelity that bothered me, or  the British bitchiness of the writing.  After all, last year I read and  thoroughly enjoyed Sue Margolis' Neurotica.<br />What saved this from being  a 1-star book is that the final 19 pages are pretty good, albeit very  unrealistic.  However, it's definitely not worth the first 306 pages -  replete with champagne, farts, bodily fluid, and La Perla lingerie - to get  there.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance	2000-06-21

There's no hero who does hurtful things in a fit of pique,  there's no heroine who behaves in accordance with the story as opposed to  the story progressing naturally because of the characters.  And, thank  goodness, there's no villain or suspense sub-plot.<br />No, there's just two  people who are more than their appearances would lead you to believe - two  people who have to work through painful issues that are holding them  back.<br />I recommend this book strongly, and hope author Davis will write a  story for the heroine's best friend and another for the hero's sister.  They deserve to find love too!<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher, All  About Romance	2000-05-27
US	53087515	R1PR9WWGLOKANR	042517428X	983788058	The Burning Point	Books	3	6	9	N	N	Anticipation far exceeded reading experience	When I've read Mary Jo Putney in the past, her books have transported me to a different setting, and I've felt at home amidst the pages of the book, experiencing and feeling what her characters were going through.  This did not happen for me when reading The Burning Point.<br />Kate Corsi returns to her Maryland family home after her father, Sam Corsi dies. She has been an architect in San Fransisco, estranged from her father, for ten years, since her marriage ended. She has always dreamed of running the family demolition business, and her father's will opens up that option for her - if she'll agree to live in the same house as her ex-husband for a year, she can be part of the business. Not only that, but her brother Tom, whom Sam disowned/disinherited ten years before as well, will be reinstated back into the will.<br />Kate has never told anyone but her brother and one friend why she and ex-husband Patrick Donovan divorced - she was raised too well by her WASP mother to air dirty linen. Had her family known Patrick had beaten her, they would not have, in effect, replaced both Kate and Tom with Patrick in the family business, and the family heart. Can she put aside her fears and unresolved feelings for Patrick in order to gain all she wants?  And, can Patrick, who has spent years recovering from being an abuser, and who still loves Kate, live with her for a year and not muck it up again?<br />While author Putney does nicely with a secondary romance between Kate's mother and a close family friend, and creates a homosexual character in a romance who is neither a walking stereotype nor a villain, the book revolves around too many overly-used premises to succeed. First is the will stipulation, which I find to be contrived. I've read it in historicals and contemporaries, and, as if often the case, while I generally find it contrived, it bothers me more in a contemporary than in an historical.  Indeed, a couple of the problems I had with this book bothered me more because the book was a contemporary rather than a historical romance.<br />Secondly, the most prominent character in the book is neither the hero nor the heroine. Indeed, the most prominent character isn't even alive, and he's far more of a negative character than anyone in the book seems to believe. I'm talking, of course, about Sam Corsi, a man who bullied his wife and children throughout their lives, and yet was seen as this sort of larger-than-life influence rather than the bully he was. How many books have you read where a secondary character manages to overshadow the hero and heroine? In the same vein, I also found myself more interested in the growing relationship between Kate's mother and family friend Charles - how many romances have you read where a secondary romance is more intriguing than the primary?<br />Next is that the villain in the book seemed totally unnecessary. Now this is truly spoiler material, so I won't reveal who that person is, but the book could have succeeded without his/her inclusion at all. This is a problem with all too many romances, where there is a villainous sub-plot that seems extranneous.<br />There is also the spousal abuse itself, and, as I stated, my problems with it are not, per se, the abuse. My problems with this part of the story are as follows:<br />Though the hero and heroine have not seen each other for ten years and each has gotten on with their lives, they are in bed together after their decade-long absence within two months. Given that the heroine must take the hero's word on it as to whether he has truly reformed, this seemed too quick to me.<br />Too much of the discussion between hero and heroine on their shared history and recovery sounds like a discussion between therapists about spousal abuse than it does a series of conversations between a man and the woman he used to abuse.<br />Too much secrecy on the heroine's part in not telling her family why she and the hero split up.  Though partially explained, it seemed too contrived, a too-neat puzzle piece to make the will stipulation fit the story.<br />The abuse itself. For some reason, it is more difficult to forgive a man who hits his wife in a contemporary setting than it is to forgive a man similar transgressions in a historical setting.<br />I am looking forward to MJP's July release, which is another historical romance.  I hope to regain the magic I've experienced with her in the past.<br />BTW, I've more fully explored this book, and done a brief Q&amp;A with author Putney in issue #95 of At the Back Fence, at All About Romance.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher, All About Romanceseemed too contrived, a too-neat puzzle piece to make the will stipulation fit the story. <br />The abuse itself.

For the Amish, being a member of the community is what is important.  These two conflicting world views collide when attorney Ellie Hathaway agrees to  defend Katie Fisher, her distant 18-year-old Amish relative, against the  charge that she killed her infant.<br />Katie denies both the murder *and* the  birth, which means she is either mentally unstable or lying.  Given her  religious faith, the latter is unbelievable, and as Ellie gets to know  Katie, the former becomes less and less believable as well.  Where does the  truth lie?<br />Although this question is answered by the end of the book,  Plain Truth is less a whudunit (or whydunit) than it is a fascinating work  of fiction about the Amish life as compared to the secular life led by  Ellie Hathaway.  In order to keep Katie out of jail pending the trial, she  agrees to take custody of Katie, which means living on the Fisher family's  farm, and integrating somewhat into their way of life.<br />This premise  does not come across as contrived in the context of the story.  The  narrative, the main and secondary characters, and the setting of the Plain  culture are seamlessly integrated to create a very strong work of  fiction.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance	2000-05-08

However, the execution of the story left something to be desired.  I well and truly wanted to like this book more than I ended up  liking it.  Why?<br />Partly because of the writing.  Author Hendrix is  American, which surprised me because the book read as though it had been  written and edited in Ireland.  In other words, some of the words and  phrasing made it difficult for me to understand what was going on.  On the  one hand, I think the author should be commended for fooling me.  On the  other hand, I wish I'd been able to understand certain things w/out having  to re-read them.<br />More importantly, however, was that the set up was there  for this book to be a real romp - have all the women in this village w/hold  their cooking, cleaning, and &quot;personal&quot; favors from the men to  induce the men to propose marriage.  I've seen this &quot;w/holding of  favors&quot; used in other romances for other goals, and always found it an  enjoyable premise.  I looked forward to it w/this goal in mind, but believe  the author unnecessarily complicated the book.<br />I would have preferred the  journalist heroine, who initially believes the hero is nothing but a  rape-the-land industrialist, to have discovered that he was not such a man  earlier.  The author could have maintained the conflict between their  &quot;suspicians at war with their emotions&quot; and still cut a few  investigatory scenes.  While the book is not too long by word count, the  focus on the investigation was.  I'd have found it a better book - in the B  range rather than the C range - had there been more focus on the villagers  after the women's boycott went into effect.<br />Still, I think this is an  author to watch, and will definitely try her again.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes  Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance	2000-05-08

First off the bat, I'd like to say that I'm not a big fan of these &quot;mini&quot; books culminating or beginning in a full-length historical.  It's very difficult to set a historical scene, introduce a  variety of characters, and tell a love story in 150 pages.  The only book  that truly worked for me in this format was Julie Garwood's One White Rose,  and that was because it was primarily a Cabin Romance with two characters  for most of the book.<br />Bridget is not - it sets out to not only introduce  a place and time, but an entire series.  While there are glimmers of a  really good read in this short piece, too much is left out in the way of  the lead characters' backgrounds to make the romance truly  effective.<br />And, one more thing - LLM used to be known for her scorching  sensuality, but her most recent romances have been very tame.  I'll admit  she used to go over the top with characters' reactions to one another, but  this is a major, major change, and those expecting vintage LLM should know  her recent work is very, very tame.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher,  All About Romance	2000-05-06

Because I love the writing of author Deborah Simmons so much, I've forbidden myself from reviewing her at my own site (All About Romance).  But nothing can stop me here from telling you how delightful I found The  Gentleman Thief.<br />While this author is equally at home writing intense  medievals, she sparkles like a jewel with her witty and sexy historicals  set in and around the regency period.<br />If you enjoy words so witty that  even the names of characters can make you laugh, and if you enjoy delicious  love scenes, please give this one a try.  I believe Deborah Simmons is as  good, if not better, than Amanda Quick, and if you have loved some of  Quick's older regency-set historicals, trust me that you'll adore Simmons'  as well.

Well, those  elements are in place, but what's purposely missing is the damsel in  distress.<br />The damsel not-in-distress is Prudence Lancaster, a  bespectacled author with ink-stained hands. She is strong, level-headed,  intelligent and determined. She is also on the shelf, never having noticed  her body beyond the fact that it is unfashionably tall, bronzed, and leggy.  Her face? She has never noticed its beauty behind the glasses her sister,  &quot;the pretty sister,&quot; has her constantly wear.<br />The Devil Earl  is the hero. Dark, intense, with brooding gray eyes, Sebastian Ravenscar  has been a party to all sorts of carnal debauchery in the past. He has  never met a woman who could satisfy him in body and mind...until he meets  Prudence. She alone is not afraid of him - she sees him as a pagan god  capable of providing the thrills she has only written about.<br />Prudence  and Sebastian fit together in body, mind, and soul. Sebastian's discovery  of the delights of Prudence are many and filled with loving humor. It's  such fun to read Sebastian's erotic musings -- he lusts after her  ink-stained hands and delights in removing her spectacles. It's so  enjoyable to have a heroine reach out and literally grab (ahem) what she  wants.<br />Deborah Simmons has accomplished in this regency-set historical a  gentle parody of a gothic novel. There are enough superficial similarities  to Amanda Quick's Ravished that I feared The Devil Earl would be a clone.  Happily, the books are not so similar after all. And Simmons' book is  actually better -- the heroine and hero are more attractive and believable,  and there are secondary characters who grow to become enjoyable as well.<br />What's more, this author has fashioned wonderfully erotic love scenes -  no doubt Sebastian's early lessons from his debauched youth will provide a  life-time of bliss for Prudence. And she, with her ink-stained hands,  imagination, and loving soul, will stimulate his mind, body, and heart  forever.<br />Deborah Simmons has followed up the wonderful The Vicar's  Daughter with another Regency-era historical that is easy to read, funny,  and sexy.

His boss assigns  him to do a series on the Wishing Star Foundation, run by Dr. Cameo  Glynn.<br />Dr. Cameo Glynn was born deaf, but has been part of the hearing  world since adulthood with the aid of a Cochlear implant.  But she is  haunted by the mistreatment of her parents, and a continued bad  relationship with her mother, who is abusive and mentally ill.  Cammy is  beautiful, sterile, and does not trust journalists.<br />Jackson's got a  wonderful way with kids, and it doesn't take long for him to win Cammy's  heart, although she fights him every step of the way.  But Jackson is  willing to go the distance and do what he must to win her trust as well as  her love.  While there's much to like about this book, Cammy's stubborn  reluctance to commit to Jackson eventually requires the suspension of a bit  too much disbelief.  Indeed, the sterility issue, so common and meaningful  in historical romance, seems slightly out of place in modern times.<br />Overall, however, this is a fine romance and one well worth reading.

The only thing scandalous about Scandalous Suzanne is that it was published. Rarely have I read a book that is utterly devoid of sensuality and filled with dialogue so stilted no real person would ever speak it -  not even in 1876.  This story takes place in Florida, where a handsome  Yankee journalist, Ethan Todd, is invited by the editor of the Tallahassee  newspaper, to sample the charms and culture of the South after having  written negatively of Southerners. The editor's daughter, Suzanne Crane, is  a motherless, tomboyish, humorless shrew who is not at all pleased that  this vile Yankee will be staying in her home where she will have to  entertain him.<br />While this premise sounds cute, please believe me when I  say the book is anything but. While there could have been chemistry between  these two, the author manages not to create any sparks whatsoever. Forget  the fact that they are not intimate until the end of the story, because  even the kisses they steal throughout the story are about as interesting as  watching paint dry.<br />What makes matters worse is that the dialogue is  written so poorly that it sounds as though they are reading lines in a bad  play -- nobody talks like the people do in this book!<br />After being caught  in a couple of compromising situations, they are forced to marry. Suzanne  is so naive about matters between men and women she constantly refers to  the sex act as &quot;carnal knowledge&quot;. Sure makes things sound  appetizing, doesn't it?<br />Suzanne wants an annulment. Ethan does not. She  runs away from home and has quite an adventure as a card dealer wearing  hussy clothes on a Mississippi gambling boat. By the time she is rescued by  Ethan, she has grown wiser and accepts what her husband is dying to teach  her about the ways of men, women and carnal knowledge.<br />It is not that  this book is too sweet for this reviewer's tastes, it is that the sweetness  is cloying and artificial. Between the complete lack of sizzle and the  deadening dialogue, one has the feeling this author could douse the fire of  a sailor on shore leave after six months at sea.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes  Books<br />Publisher, All About Romancezzle and the  deadening dialogue, one has the feeling this author could douse the fire of  a sailor on shore leave after six months at sea. <br />TTFN, Laurie Likes  Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance	2000-05-04

Her Heaven in his Arms is one of my favorite Road Romances. So I keenly anticipated reading her latest release, Wild Irish Rose, which is another Road Romance.  And while it took me awhile to appreciate this book, something unusual and  very wonderful happened while reading it.  After the first third or so, and  being bothered by some very purple prose, I noticed that I was hearing in  my head every line of dialogue said by the heroine in her lilting Irish  brogue. This character had completely come alive for me, and since she  lived in medieval Ireland, I'd say that was quite a feat!<br />Wild Irish  Rose is the tale of Moreen, a foundling raised in a convent who sets out to  join a troop of minstrels on a quest to discover her parentage. This bawdy  group of minstrels includes the lusty, poetic actor Colin, who is itching  to get under Moreen's skirts.<br />There is quite a bit of hilarity and high  drama as Moreen joins the troop as a singer and actress. She sings like an  angel, but the thought of behaving as these sinful and godless minstrels do  sickens here. She feels no better than a whore, but even that is better  than not knowing who she really is, really belongs to.<br />Colin isn't  really who he seems to be either. Not just a lusty actor, he is the son of  a clan chief who watched his family butchered in war with the English a  decade before. Now he wants revenge, and through Moreen, he just might be  able to get it.<br />The feelings these two have for each other are  undeniable, although each chalks it up to pure and simple lust. But there  is more there, and they discover their love when the truth about Colin is  revealed. Moreen is desperate, willing to sacrifice her innocence to lure  Colin away from his revenge, which they are both certain will lead to his  death.<br />This was a very powerful scene to read, and was the moment in  which Colin became as real for me as Moreen. She taunts him by saying that,  with him gone, she will end up as nothing more than a whore. When he  responds, &quot;You will whore for no one but me&quot;, I felt a chill down  my spine.<br />The powerful moments in this book are mixed up with some very  hilarious ones. This troop of minstrels, thieves, whores, and drunkards,  care for one another as a family, and this caring comes out in both  poignant and funny ways. Bodily functions, urges - nothing is sacred.<br />The secondary characters in this book, while seemingly cruel when Moreen  joined them, care for each other like the family Moreen never had. Yes,  they do represent many of the seven sins, such as gluttony and lust, but  Moreen herself, by her pride and unwillingness to try to see beyond the  superficial, is by no means perfect.<br />Her pride and unwillingness slowly  melt away as she comes to see her fellow band of merry-makers as  individuals. For his part, while Colin is more poet than warrior, he feels  his destiny is to die while seeking revenge. But Moreen touches his heart  in such a way that he is able to make peace instead. Once their teasing and  taunting becomes loving instead of hateful (on Moreen's end), it becomes  very engaging indeed.<br />Even though I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of  hearing Moreen come alive in my head, it took me quite awhile to realize  it. While the sights, sounds, and smells of Heaven in his Arms seemed so  real, they seemed artificial and purposely flowery here. Whether the author  has changed or I have, I cannot be sure. The purple prose takes awhile to  get used to, although it is apparent the author has researched the setting  thoroughly.<br />All in all, it'll be worth the readers' time to forge ahead  on the journey the author proposes. For readers who enjoy Road Romances,  sexual and very down-to-earth humor, this should work well. I guarantee  that any reader who reads the scene of Moreen singing at her wedding will  be LOL.<br />I give this book a qualified Bgrade. The delightfully bawdy  humor and the vitality of the heroine on balance outweigh the purple prose.  I prefer this author's Road Romances to her mystical faery books, and hope  she writes another historical soon.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher,  All About Romancequalified B grade.

And while BEWITCHING THE BARON features a fairly exciting story line, the lead characters never came  to life for me.  Then too, one of the book's strengths early on - the  essence of the English countryside in the 1730's, with its attendant  superstition and fear of witches - became melodramatic as the book moved  into its final quarter.  Even so, when the story moved out of the  countryside and into London, whatever connection I had managed to make with  the hero and heroine disappeared.<br />Author Lisa Cach shows a tremendous  amount of promise, and I really wanted to like this book better than I did.  But because I never truly connected with either lead character, I never  felt the joy of their coming together, finally, in love for a happily ever  after.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance	2000-05-03

I've asked myself this question repeatedly and came to the conclusion that there is something about  Christina Dodd's writing that trips a switch in my psyche to allow her to  write scenes I'd never accept if written by another author.<br />She did it  first in A WELL PLEASURED LADY, and has done it again in RULES OF SURRENDER  (AWPL gets an A from me; ROS gets a B-).  Somehow, her blending of dark  humor, interesting secondary characters, quick pacing, hidden pathos, and  incendiary (and politically incorrect) love scenes  have me loving heroes  who many others find utterly unlovable.<br />If you read AWPL and did not  enjoy it, I doubt you will enjoy ROS.

This is problem  two.<br />As for the story, here it is in a nutshell: Orphaned gentlewoman  agrees to sell herself at auction to save her uncle and aunt's home and  finance her sister's coming out. She is bought by kind-hearted hero to  prevent a sadist from buying her first.<br />He doesn't know she is part of  the gentry but falls in love anyway. Even though every other male in his  family is scandalous and he himself is the bastard heir to the family title  and fortune, he tries to conduct himself admirably to prevent scandal at  every turn.<br />She begins to fall in love with him even though she knows  nothing of the ways of mistress-ing and works hard to fool him so that he  won't know she is a gentlewoman.<br />The drama comes from his rescuing her  from the sadist who must have her. But the conflict comes from his wanting  to marry her, which she won't do. She would protect her love and prevent  the scandal of his marrying his mistress. Big yawn, made bigger because it  probably wouldn't have been difficult to figure out she's really part of  the gentry. But then, without this flimsy conflict, there wouldn't be much  of a story.<br />Sorry, folks, but this is much ado about nothing. This is a  family that thrives on scandal. His father's mistress is the housekeeper.  The housekeeper is his mother. His father is getting a divorce. His uncles'  exploits are well-known to readers of other books in the Malory series. My  goodness, he is a bastard and was made heir to the family title! I just  didn't buy it. This is problem three.<br />This book then, fails on several  levels. The conflict is not credible. The hero and heroine are separate for  too much of the story. And while beta males can be part of wonderful  romances, this author should stick to what works best for her - the  ultra-masculine, arrogant, darkly tortured alpha male.<br />Kelsey is far the  more interesting of the two leads, and since most of us need a complex hero  to connect with, the book does not satisfy at the most basic level either.  Then too, the resolution to their dilemma is another let-down. When Derek  discovers who Kelsey really is and Kelsey realizes what she did was for  naught, this book went sailing across the room.<br />Family romances that are  spread out over several books can be wonderful reading. Authors can utilize  those family members and their relationships to illuminate and brighten the  relationship of the lead characters. But mishandled, these secondary  characters have a tendency to take over, which is what happens in Say You  Love Me. Perhaps the author should have focused on the love between Derek's  father and the housekeeper and made Derek and Kelsey secondary characters.  Now, that would have been interesting.<br />Johanna Lindsey used to write two  paperbacks a year. Now she writes one hardcover a year. Even die-hard fans  of the Malory series won't like this one.<br />Those of you looking for some  good reads by this author should try instead: Man of My Dreams, Once a  Princess, or the politically incorrect Prisoner of My Desire.<br />TTFN,  Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher, All About RomanceHis father's mistress is the housekeeper.

I applaud the panache and aplomb with which CatherineCoulter has created this diverting Regency-era tale of romance andsuspense. While the spine of the book calls it simply a novel, it is part romance, part mystery, part pure farce. It is pure delight, especially for those ex-or-about-to-be-ex Catherine Coulter fans. This book will change your mind. It changed mine.<br />At the start of this clever tale, Rohan Carrington, Baron Mountvale, sets out to uncover a mystery. How is it possible that his cold fish of a younger brother supposedly &quot;ruined&quot; one Susannah, whom he wed and left penniless before he died? After all, it is Rohan who is the family rake, upholding the reputation of both his studly father and magnificently debauched mother, known throughout England for their charm and philandering ways.<br />But Rohan is not at all what he seems. Trust me. He is a delightful, wonderful hero who gets caught up in a mystery and falls in love along the way with Susannah, who wasn't at all lucky with his dead brother George. Susannah, her younger brother, and her little daughter Marianne , are gathered up by Rohan and moved to his country estate, where he plans to look after them and falls in love along the way.<br />As does Susannah, her younger brother, and her little daughter Marianne, because Rohan is, as I said, a pretty wonderful fellow. Unfortunately, someone wants something that Susannah has, only she doesn't know what it could be.  As the mystery unravels, we meet Rohan's beautiful and youthful mother, a close friend of Rohan's who could well be the hero of a sequel, along with some of George's unsavory friends, who, along with another brother to Rohan, are up to absolutely no good, no good at all.<br />What with cat races, a limerick-singing horse trainer, a miniature map and tiny key, dead Bishops, reliquaries, etc., Catherine Coulter takes the reader on a fast-moving ride throughout the English and Scottish countryside. There's a mystery to be solved and Rohan must prove to Susannah that what men and women can do for each other is lovely, not disgusting.<br />Say what you will, but Catherine Coulter can write a great love scene when she wants to.  Surprisingly, this book seemed a bit tame , but my sense is that this book is being marketed more toward the mainstream, so perhaps that's why.<br />The Wild Baron is utterly captivating. It is a quick, funny, suspenseful read filled with lovable lead characters, enjoyable secondary characters, and a cast of villains that will lead you on a merry chase. The end result of the mystery is outlandish, but this is fantasy and I had no trouble accepting the outcome Ms. Coulter presented.<br />If you have given up on this author or had contemplated doing so, I suggest giving this author another try and reading this book. If you want to read another Coulter book that presents a wonderful, good-guy hero, I'd suggest Night Fire.<br />The reason this book won't be joining my all-time keeper list? Not quite enough sizzle shown between Rohan and Susannah. Though referred to quite a bit and shown in little ways, there weren't enough actual love-making scenes for this book to earn 5-hearts from me. While love scenes don't usually make or break a book for me, it's something I've come to expect from this author. When she does it right, she does it better than practically anyone else. When she does it wrong, it is about as stimulating as a trip to the OB-GYN, as my old friend Leslie McClain wrote in her review of Rosehaven for The Romance Reader.<br />In the case of The Wild Baron, the love scenes were great, but there weren't enough. Still, this is a terrific book that should satisfy readers who appreciate good humor, great characters, and fine suspense.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance ENDhout the English and Scottish countryside.

I'm a sucker for a good fairy tale - two of my favorite books are Bewitching (Jill Barnett) and A Basket of Wishes (Rebecca Paisley). Perhaps those tales were special because the enchanted characters were the heroines. In Once Upon a Time, the fairy is the hero. I'm not sexist, but  this book simply did not enchant.<br />To give the book its due, the  beginning and ending chapters of this tale are positively lovely -- the  epilogue is downright magical. The remaining 18 chapters seem too mundane.  There is not much first-hand magic going on. As such, the majority of the  book is too much a standard historical and too little a fairy tale. Other  than a sprinkle here and there, the magic of the book disappeared as  quickly as pixie dust.<br />Perhaps it is that, for me, fairy tales work best  as romantic comedies. There is a wealth of humor to be found in the  ridiculous predicaments fairies and their loved ones face in the human  world. This, however, is not a comedy.<br />Or, maybe it is that, unlike  other favorite fairy tales, there was no dramatic break when the human  realizes how miserable life is without the magic. Just as there were no  laughs, there were no tears shed reading this book.<br />Regardless of the  reason, the story fell flat. The connection between reader and lead  characters never jells. The greatest pull I felt was toward the heroine's  great aunt Daffy. I wish her story and that of her great love had been told  instead.<br />Marylyle Rogers consistently receives the highest ratings for  her work. I was similarly disappointed with another of her books but  decided to give her another chance to win me over because of the accolades  she receives. I shouldn't have bothered - and neither should you.<br />TTFN,  Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance	2000-05-03

The hero is Miles Wellesley, a first-generation American visiting his noble English grandmother while scouting out horses for his family ranch. The heroine is Lady Victoria Pembroke, a beautiful, intelligent, spirited and  hoydenish spinster.  Their clash, of culture, of wills, and of the sexes,  makes this an enjoyable read.<br />Although their clashes are quite common in  romance, Miles' straightforward American-ness makes him a superb specimen  of a hero.  These two are bound to get together if his grandmother and her  step-mother have anything to do with it.  And if . . . they would listen to  their bodies, their minds, and their hearts.  And if they would accept that  their marriage is really not one only of convenience.<br />Miles' family  provides wonderful secondary characters.  Though his parents are British to  the bone, they have accepted the American frontier as their home and have  become more open in their views than the typical Brit.<br />His parents as  well as his siblings provide a wholeness to this book that often romances  do not always have - while it is true that Victoria's father and birth  mother are not alive, there is enough extended family to provide both lead  characters with a well-rounded sense of belonging.<br />The author expertly  uses humor in ways guaranteed to bring a smile to any readers' lips.  Lady  Victoria's twin step-sisters have been named after States in their American  mother's homeland.  They are silly chits, really, and hearing Miles and his  grandmother mistakenly-on-purpose refer to them as &quot;Atlanta and  Savannah&quot;, &quot;Florida and Virginia&quot;, etc., is quite funny.  Also humorous are the comments made by Miles' parents about their enjoyment  of marital bliss.  The scene where Miles' mother tries to allay Victoria's  fears about the marriage bed by commenting that, on the morning after her  wedding night, she &quot;looked like a kitten who'd swallowed the  cream&quot;, is priceless.<br />In fact, the major conflict in this book  concerns Victoria's fear of the marriage bed.  Victoria accepts the notion  that young women should &quot;lie back and think of England&quot;.  Her  confidants in this area, her newly-wed friend Mary Ann, as well as her  step-mother, have her so frightened about &quot;it&quot; that she becomes  obsessed with not &quot;doing it&quot;, even though Mary Ann says she only  has to do it on Saturday nights and it lasts only 15 or 20  minutes.<br />Victoria's fear conflicts tremendously with what her body has  experienced from the kisses and caresses of her handsome hero.  After a  tremendous blow-out which results in both Miles and Victoria trying to hurt  each other, and succeeding, they finally are able to come together and  accept each other as man and woman, husband and wife.<br />As is different  from many other books in the genre, this happens not at the end of the  book, but about three-quarters of the way through, leaving plenty of time  for the reader to enjoy their growing closeness.  A bit of nastiness near  the end does help to wrap up the loose ends, but by focusing on Miles and  Victoria, American and Brit, man and woman, husband and wife, the author  provides a pleasant interlude for her readers.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes  Books<br />Publisher, All About Romancekitten who'd swallowed the  cream&quot;, is priceless.<br />In fact, the major conflict in this book  concerns Victoria's fear of the marriage bed.

Overflowing with lush descriptions, second-sight, a ghost and a cat, this is a page-turning, heart-stomping tale of a love between man and woman that  endured throughout time.<br />Although primarily a contemporary romance, the  story is mirrored by a tale of long ago between a beautiful mute girl, a  Crusade-worn knight, and his evil brother.  Their tale and destiny are to  be re-lived by their contemporary counterparts, the beautiful American Kara  Fitzgerald and the rugged Scots laird, Duncan MacKinnon.<br />They are thrown  together because of her gift of second sight - through touch she can see  and feel events and emotions.  Skeptical at first, Duncan accepts her gift  and they begin a dangerous adventure that could bind them together, in life  or in death, if Duncan's evil (and supposedly dead) brother has his way.<br />The magical mysticism of Scotland adds unique flavor to this tale.  Because of his heritage, Duncan also knows a thing or two about &quot;the  sight&quot;.  He and Kara believe they are fighting against a destiny  doomed to destroy him, and, as heroes are wont to do, he would push her  away to protect her.  Kara, on the other hand, believes that her gift is  what has cost her love in the past, for she believes no man would want to  share himself as totally and completely as would occur with her.<br />Their  healing of each other, as is usual in romantic fiction, is quite unique due  to the nature of Kara's gifts.  It is Duncan's task to restore her  confidence as a woman.  Because of their unique connection with each other,  Kara can see in her mind and feel in her being Duncan's desire for her and  the things he would do with her - it sure is getting hot in here, isn't  it?.  Their intimacy is wet, hot, and very sexy.<br />As they work together,  first to protect their inner selves from each other, than to save each  other, it is easy to get caught up in their adventure.  In general I have  found that romances 400 pages in length are padded by 40 to 60 pages of  unneeded verbiage.  This book is not padded.

It's also the first Garwood romance I ever read (several years ago).  What makes it shine so bright?  Incredible humor, fabulous love scenes, and characters so very easy to love.  All that, and a princess too!<br />Some readers find Garwood's  heroines too stupid to live, but I never have.  I do, however, find each's  quirks to be lovable, and when I interviewed the author back in 1997 and  she revealed their flaws are based on her own, I marveled at how she could  turn personal weaknesses into delightful quirks of character.<br />The heroine  is not only wonderful in this book, though - the hero is to-die-for.  As I  wrote in my Desert Isle Keeper Review at All About Romance, &quot;While he  doesn't want to marry her himself, he finds something wrong with every  single bachelor he, his father, his brother, and Alesandra discuss. One has  bow-legs, another gambles, and still another has a case of 'bad  humours'.&quot;<br />This is truly a delightful and charming romance and I  encourage one and all to read it.

How many  books have individual scenes so powerful in and of themselves that they can  create such a strong reaction in a reader?<br />The epilogue of this book is  also fantastic, but lest you think I only love the end of this book, rest  assured that it's all wonderful.  Still, I was lucky enough to interview  Ms. McNaught and ask her about the epilogue, and she told me, &quot;I did  cry when I wrote the last two paragraphs of the epilogue.

If anyone can explain to me what has happened to the writing of Linda Lael Miller, I'd love to hear it.  A few years ago, her books were filled to the  brim (often over the top, frankly), with sensuality.  She even had a book  or two published in hardcover by Pocket.  Since then, however, she's been  relegated to their Sonnet line, and has written several Americana-ish  western romances that don't begin to be as complex as some of her earlier  books.  As for the sensuality, she's gone from one extreme to the other.  Whereas in earlier books her heroines could climax from a hot breath by the  hero, these newer books are chaste enough for young teens.<br />That in itself  is not necessarily a problem, but this trend toward mini-books, culminating  in a full-length romance is not a good thing, as far as I'm concerned.  How  can you explore an historical setting, introduce secondary characters, and  provide a realistic romance in less than 150 pages?<br />The answer - LLM  can't and does not in this book.  Though a brisk read, all the terrific  background information alluded to in the book, which might have made it a  good book, is skimmed over in a page or two, leaving little of substance.<br />My sense is that this might have been more worth the effort had it been  longer, but, as it is, it's nothing special.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes  Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance	2000-05-01

Both are terrific, and those  readers who love a road romance should greatly appreciate the first part,  in which the hero and heroine are on a cattle drive.  However, it is in the  second part, after a horrible incident, where Heath's mastery truly shines.  The hero, in particular, must learn to live without the use of some of his  greatest gifts, but learns that love can still be his.<br />This book has it  all - action, characterization, sexual tension, tears. . . .  Even the  somewhat sterotypical sub-plot involving a little girl seems fresh as  handled by this author.  Not only did Heath manage to create some terrific  drama in this instance, but she also managed to turn the tables on which  lead character had the &quot;moral high ground&quot; for a while.<br />I  rarely give such a strong recommendation, and don't think I've ever done so  with a Western Romance, but this one is truly special.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes  Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance	2000-04-28

There are a few problems,  including the scandal referred to in the title that is rather outlandish,  and the hero is somewhat too good to be true.

Featuring lots of action but not much logic, one villainous character  reminded me of the incompetent sheriff from Smokey &amp; the Bandit, while  the many others seem to have been lifted from of every  &quot;drug-cartel&quot; television show I've ever seen.<br />The problems  start nearly at the beginning of the book and continue all the way through.  The Colombians or the corrupt politician and sheriff kill everyone, for  the smallest of reasons.  Someone feeds a cat, they are killed.  Someone  sees something in the hall, they are killed.<br />While romantic suspense  novels require some suspension of disbelief, California Moon has so many  coincidences that reality goes out the window fairly early on.  And while  publisher Mira goes to pains to showcase author Lanigan as the author of  the novelization for Romancing the Stone, the romance in California Moon  fails on almost every level.<br />Finally, the history involving the heroine  and her true background seemed absurd as well, something you'd read in a  very early Danielle Steel novel, which is not a compliment.<br />TTFN, Laurie  Likes Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance	2000-04-28

At other times, her prose is too purple, her characters too stylized, and her writing melodramatic.  In this instance, everything came together and Love Song for a Raven worked wonderfully well.  If you love Cabin/Road Romances, if you love steamy love scenes that go on forever, if you love a love story with characters whose  pain will make you cry, this book should do the trick!...	2000-04-27

Patricia Oliver is the only Regency Romance author I religiously read.  She melds together the ambience of the era with characters who seem very real.  Many Regency Romance authors seem to get bogged down in the descriptions, phrasing, and setting of the era that the characters fail to  come alive.  Not so with Patricia Oliver.  This is the fourth book I've  read by her, and it's the best - I give it a B+.<br />What works so well in  this book is that both the hero and heroine are both types we've seen  before, and yet they seem fresh here.  There's the heroine who refuses to  be what Society tells her to be, and the hero who believes women are  foolish creatures.<br />When these two fall in love, it's wonderful, and the  villains are the &quot;best&quot; villains I've ever come across in a  Regency Romance.  This is truly a fine book, with strong secondary  characters as well, and I highly recommend it.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes  Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance<br />[...]	2000-04-27
US	53087515	R3K0G7Q0ESZZUY	0373258607	684534718	Night Moves (Blaze)	Books	2	3	5	N	N	Very annoying romance!	This is the first romance I've read by Thea Devine, and I don't think I'll be reading any more.  Yes, the love scenes plentiful, but more purple than erotic, and the heroine is not crafted with enough care to make her motivations real.  And, if you are the type to be annoyed by lots and lots of italics, this book should push you over the edge.<br />Because this is a  series romance and is, by nature, short, I'll keep the synopsis short:  Girl returns to home town after suffering business downturn and meets up  with old boyfriend who is determined to win her back.  When they were in  high school, they almost did it, until she got cold feet and left town.  Now that she's back, she'll definitely do it, but won't share her heart,  which is what the boy-now-hunk-a-hunk-a-man wants.<br />Will they be able at  last to share mind and body?  If your response is like mine was, you really  won't care by the time you reach the climax, when the heroine comes to her  senses so quickly you'll have to read it twice to understand what  happened.<br />My advice?  Pass this one by.(...)	2000-04-27
US	53087515	R2D9J4MHM87Q5P	1551665794	551430918	Twelve Across	Books	4	13	15	N	N	Twelve Across is a nice evening's read	Many of us who discovered Barbara Delinsky after she made the jump from romance to fiction/women's fiction are enjoying MIRA's re-issues of her earlier series romances.  I know I'm one of them, and though I did have a couple of problems with Twelve Across, I enjoyed it well enough to recommend.  If you are a fan of Cabin/Road romances, this one should suitly  nicely.  If you enjoy romances with less-than-gorgeous heroines, this one  is a great one, and here's why.  The hero is drop-dead handsome and when he  first meets the heroine, he doesn't see much, but as they fall in love, she  becomes more beautiful to him.  What could be more romantic than  that?<br />Another point to recommend this book is that, even though there is  a Big Secret, it's resolved easily enough.  However, what is behind the big  secret, and how it affects the lifestyle of the hero goes on a bit too  long.  The book becomes slightly sappy by the end, but because of its  strengths, this one is still a recommended read.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes  Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance.<br />(  )	2000-04-27

What makes Indiscretion work so well is the plot structure, which immediately reveals the past relationship between widowed heroine Anne and  Patrick Sutherland, fifth Viscount Glengramach.<br />Queen Victoria sends these two, in the  company of Patrick's eccentric aunt, to investigate the death of Anne's  uncle - was it murder or did he die of natural causes?  While determining  that is the basis for the story, it does not IN THE LEAST bog down the  romantic interplay between Anne and Patrick, or the clever banter with and  between secondary characters who are wonderful as well.<br />Anne wants  nothing to do with him and Patrick will do anything to get her back, even  if it means suffering from &quot;housemaid's knee&quot; while pretending to  be her butler.  This is an incredibly witty farce and is a far more sexual  book than others I've read by author Hunter in the past.  It's  terrific!<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books<br />Publisher, All About Romance	2000-04-15

While perhaps not as fabulous as TheLast Rogue of The Vicar's Daughter, *any* lover of witty and sexy regency-set historicals should love The Gentleman Thief.  Just about everything works in this book, although it does bog down slightly towards the end, only to be redeemed by a sparkling souffle of a finale.<br />TTFN	2000-04-13

Anyone who reads or watches popular media will be familiar w/her recent romance/marriage/pending divorce from a wealthy yachtsman and will have People Magazine and Entertainment Tonight  snippets in their head as they read this book.  As a result, this book  comes off as self-indulgent and made me wonder if her next book will  feature a romance between a thin, beautiful, and wealthy woman and a tanned  former-movie-star turned bon vivant (Steel is now dating George Hamilton).  My advice?  Steer clear of this one.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books All About  Romance ...	2000-04-13

The book is little more than a series of kidnappings and/or rescues, rapes and  recriminations, repeated several times throughout the book.  There are a  couple of good scenes very near the end, which is why it rated higher than  one star.<br />I'd recommend several Lindsey books over and above this one,  including Man of My Dreams, Once a Princess, and, my favorite Lindsey,  Prisoner of My Desire.<br />TTFN, Laurie Likes Books	2000-03-16

If you enjoy romances of  redemption, this is one you should go for.  Heroes don't start out more  selfish and vulgar than this, and yet, by the end, readers will adore him.	2000-03-13

But for those readers looking for more  varied entertainment, the pickings are fairly slim here.  The lead  characters are likable enough, but the secondaries are either over-the-top  or stereotypical.  The characters' backgrounds require a great deal of  suspension of disbelief, and the small word count of the series romance  only exacerbates these flaws.	2000-03-13

This book is written in two distinct parts, the first being solely from the female protagonist's POV.  The second part is written from the POV of many of the  characters.  Underneath it all, this is a romance, but not in the  &quot;genre&quot; style.  What makes this book work is that the author  presents characters who, although they may act dishonorably, are not  immoral.  To give more detail would do a disservice to the prose, which  ends in a very ethereal manner.	2000-03-13

I gave it a D, my colleague gave it an A-.  For me, there were far too many secrets to be revealed, each at an excruiatingly slow pace.  Reading it was like receiving the Chinese Water Torture.<br />This is a story of the reuinion of  a couple who split up a dozen years in the past.  While such a story could  be poignant, this one failed because the split did not seem realistic.  If  you were newly married and struck by tragedy and your mate said, in a fit  of sadness and anger that they never wanted to see you again, would you  just leave - like that?  I don't think so!<br />Finally, though this author  is known for her humor, many of the attempts in this book were annoying  rather than funny.	2000-03-05

Kathryn Lynn Davis' lyrical and sumptuous writing style shines more strongly in Too Deep for Tears than in any of her other books.  Readers looking for immensely emotional and cathartic prose should get their hands on a copy of this book immediately.  The characterizations are exquisite,  the descriptions of Scotland, England, India, and China so real you'll feel  as though you're there, and the connection you'll feel to the characters  and the lands will last long after you've finished the book.  Just be sure  to have a jumbo-sized box of Kleenex handy - you'll need it.<br />We've  reviewed all three books in this trilogy at All About Romance, and I was  lucky enough to interview the author a few years ago.  She is an amazing  talent.	2000-03-05
