However, the book is rather dry and offers very little \\"food for thought.\\" It's mostly names, dates, and movements. The writing is uninspired and not very compelling. <br /> <br />As a guide to the history of UU, this book is acceptable. I've encountered far more interesting books and essays on the subject, however. The level of detail is high, but you will definitely not find yourself reading this book for anything beyond obscure details of the past.	2005-09-18

It consists of 7 essays by various UU figures, and addresses all the major points: what UUs believe, how congregations and the UU Association work, what programs and tools UU offers for people who join a congregation, etc. There's also a good historical overview of where Unitarianism and Universalism come from, and how they ended up merging into the UUA. <br /> <br />If you want a simple, pleasant introduction to Universal Unitarianism, I think this is a great place to start. I imagine UUs would also find this handy for finding ways to communicate more clearly to others what their beliefs are.	2005-09-18

I think the little statue of Kuan Yin is nicely done, and the cardboard \\"shrine\\" actually has a rather nice look and feel to it. I have it and the figurine displayed on my desk, and I find it very pleasant to look at. No, it is no replacement for going to a dedicated, ancient Kuan Yin temple, but it is a good place to find your center during the day. <br /> <br />As for the book, I find it too to be lovingly executed. It provides a nice overview of Kuan Yin's history and importance, background on sutras and some basic meditations, etc. No, you are not going to be writing a master's thesis on Buddhism with this book, but that is not what it is for. It is meant to be a gentle introduction to Kuan Yin, and inspirational. I feel it satisfies in both regards. <br /> <br />Give or receive this nice little boxed set with an open heart, and it will find a way to inspire and soothe.	2005-06-06

Lacking depth in some key areas	I've read a number of books on Buddhism, and I can easily say this is one of the best I've encountered for providing a solid background and overview of this religion-slash-philosophy. However, the book suffers from something of an identity crisis, and lacks some critical information.    First off, the title says what this book is really about: *UNDERSTANDING* Buddhism. There is a wealth of information here, ranging from the basics (the story of the Buddha, the Four Noble Truths, cardinal precepts, etc.) on to explorations of the different branches (Vajrayana, Pure Land, Zen) and places Buddhism can be found in art and culture. This book is fantastic for learning about where Buddhism came from, where it is today, and where it may be going in the future.    However, the caveat is that this book is not so much oriented towards applying Buddhism to your daily life. The cover details really make it sound like you'll be getting lots of info on living in a Buddhist way, but it's just not true. There's a decent section on meditation, but by and large the book offers only vague guidance for putting the ideas you read about into practice. So, don't fall for the publisher and marketing hype - this is a book about understanding Buddhism, and not so much living it.    That said, the book falls flat on its face when it comes to providing some key information. The biggest example would be karma. Karma, a very important idea in Buddhism, is given less than TWO pages of discussion in a 400 page book! Yes, karma is a fairly simple concept, but anyone who has studied Einstein's theory of relativity can tell you that it's the simple things that are the hardest to understand intuitively. I would have gladly traded the section on Buddhism in art if it had meant there would be a truly good exploration of karma and its far-reaching impacts.    The long and the short of it is this: If you know little or nothing about Buddhism, and want a broad introduction, this is an excellent place to start. Gary Gach has a playful and enjoyable writing style. The book is chock full of interesting content. Just don't buy this book with the expectation that it will guide you in leading a more Buddha-y life. For that, I recommend a much more hands-on title, such as the excellent /Complete Idiot's Guide to Zen Living/.	2005-05-06

It is just *that* amazing. With /Fabric of the Cosmos/, Brian Greene has put together one of the most readable introductions to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the various theories about space and time. <br /> <br />I'm a pretty sharp guy, according to my ego and people who know me - but Einstein's theory of relativity has always somewhat eluded me. Sure, I understood intellectually the general idea, but there is a huge difference between knowing something and truly understanding it and grasping it. Greene's explanation of this and so many other concepts absolutely blows my mind in terms of simplicity and clarity. <br /> <br />I can think of no higher praise for a popular science book than this: It explains and clarifies so many wonderful topics, ones that would otherwise be beyond the reach of people like me. We're not physics majors and have no desire to be. I used to think Stephen Hawking's books were the best for the general public to understand time, space, black holes, etc. It is obvious I was mistaken, because /Fabric of the Cosmos/ is the most straightforward and ENGAGING book I've read in this genre. There's nary an equation or formula to be found in the main text (there are math-y details in the endnotes for those who want them), and everything is very well organized and explained. <br /> <br />Bottom line: If you want to explore the limits of humanity's understanding of space and time, and challenge the everyday \\"truth\\" of reality as you know it, buy this book now.	2005-04-15

That's not to say that the first novel is bad - indeed, it supplies a great story with impressive character development, and I highly recommend it. But /Outlaw/ was marred by an unbelievable number of editing errors. /Heretic/ fares a good deal better. <br /> <br />This time around, the story flows much more smoothly. /Outlaw/ had to struggle with setting the stage for this massive world that is, quite frankly, very unfamiliar to most Westerners - and rather foreign to the world of Magic in particular. /Heretic/ has none of this background baggage to deal with, instead plunging right in and letting the now-fully developed characters shine. There's a lot of action in this book, and a good deal of the pieces of the Kamigawa puzzle come together solidly. /Heretic/ is a very fast and enjoyable read. <br /> <br />Of course, I still have to nitpick - /Heretic/ has more editing errors than a novel should. It's nowhere near as bad as /Outlaw/ was in this regard, but the errors do pop up enough that it can be a bit disturbing. But /Heretic/ is very worthy of a full 5 stars, and I will say that this is one of the best fantasy novels I've read in some time (due in no small part to the fabulous setting of Kamigawa itself). If you haven't gotten into this cycle yet, grab this book and /Outlaw/ and prepare for a great reading experience.	2005-03-18

It's not preachy, it's not condescending - it is simply a very human book. Most of what /Relax/ covers was not terribly revolutionary to me, but I've spent the last few years studying Eastern philosophy in general, and Taoism in particular. Still, Raymond Barnett outlines everything in a very enjoyable format, phrased in such a way as to pique the curiosity of the Western mind without being so intense as to scare people away. Despite being familiar with most of the ideas presented here, I got a great deal out of reading this book. <br /> <br />/Relax, You're Already Home/ is not about sitting and meditating, or doing Tai Chi, or chanting 'OM' as you do your dishes. You can do that stuff if you want, and Barnett won't tell you it's wrong to do so. But he also emphasizes that such practices are not necessary to put traditional Chinese/Taoist wisdom to use on a day-to-day basis. Live simply, go with the flow, and keep in touch with nature. If that path leads you to meditation, so much the better. But /Relax/ stresses the importance of good habits in ordinary daily living first and foremost, and I believe this will prove to be its greatest strength in speaking to Westerners. <br /> <br />If you're at all curious about Taoism or just living a simpler, richer life, I can't think of a better book to get started with. Everything you need is right here.	2005-03-13
US	41561242	R4JWCYJDEK0VG	0785818618	264371933	The Essence of Tao	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Excellent introduction, lots of good info and quotes	Western books on Taoism tend to fall into one of two main categories: New Age-y, fluffy titles that really have nothing to do with the Tao; and abstruse litanies about the \\"proper\\" way to follow the Tao. It is refreshing for me to say that /The Essence of Tao/ fits into neither category, and instead offers an excellent overview of Tao in its many guises. Finally, there is a book that can compete with /The Complete Idiot's Guide to Taoism/ for a readable and enjoyable introduction to Taoism. <br /> <br />This book is a bit like one of those holiday chocolate samplers - you won't get lots of any one thing, but you will get a good taste for what's out there. Pamela Ball manages to talk about the Tao, Yin-Yang polarity, Feng Shui, meditation, Taoist scriptures, Chinese medicine, the Tao's relation to other major religious concepts, and so forth. There's also a nice concluding chapter to tie everything together in a way that is meaningful for the reader, rather than dumping a dozen Chinese concepts in one's lap and saying \\"figure it out on your own.\\" Of course, with the Tao, you have to do that anyway - but a little guidance never hurts. <br /> <br />Pamela Ball's style of writing is a refreshing one that is both informative and entertaining to read. My favorite feature of /The Essence of Tao/ is the collection of related quotations at the end of each chapter. Ball doesn't limit herself to Taoist or even Asian influences when picking these quotes, and they are often worth reading. Sometimes, they can be downright enlightening. <br /> <br />Ultimately, a book about Taoism can only do so much for you. The Tao is very much an internal path (as any true religion or philosophy is). /The Essence of Tao/ is a nice introduction, and a handy pointer to where you might want to go with your travels on the Way.	2004-10-27

I breezed through the opening chapters, enjoying every bit of it. Then somewhere around the middle of the book, it all falls apart. It quickly became a chore to trudge through the overly verbose descriptions of everything - and many such descriptions used weird combinations of words or ones that just didn't make sense.    Today, I officially gave up on trying to finish /Wild Animus/, part way through the 9th chapter. I couldn't bring myself to read more than a couple pages at a time. There were whole sets of paragraphs that just made my stomach churn because of how wordy they were, or because the author was rehashing the same topic that had come up a dozen other times in previous chapters. Case in point, the mood swing conversations between Ransom and Lindy - one minute they're lovingly chatting, the next one is pissed off at the other for some random reason. Two or three sentences later, they make up and (almost always) end up having sex. Needless to say, this kind of dead-horse-beating gets tiring very quickly. Note to Rich Shapero - moody conversations do not make for good character development. And no, having LOTS of moody conversations isn't any more effective.    I tried really hard to like this book, because the premise is intriguing. Everything started out great, and I could feel myself getting into the plot and the characters. It's a shame that things start to unravel quickly towards the middle, and I'm now left with a book that I don't even have the mental strength to finish. I hate to let a book go to waste, especially one with so much potential. Alas, /Wild Animus/ does not live up to the great book it could have been.	2004-10-17

I've gone Samurai-crazy with the recent release of \\"Champions of Kamigawa,\\" and I went out on street release day to buy a fat pack of the new set (tournament pack, 3 boosters, this novel, etc. in one package). Kamigawa presents an awesome new setting for Magic, and /Outlaw/ in turn serves as a great introduction to this setting and its major players. The story has a good flow to it and is filled with well developed characters from the various races. The stage is nicely set for the Kamigawa War, and it really is exciting to read the book and see how all the races and spells in the new card set fit together. <br /> <br />I really want to give this book a full 5 stars, but I can't for one very simple reason - the editing in this novel is abysmal. It's inevitable that any book of significant length will contain a typographical error or three. However, there are far too many ridiculously simple screw ups in this book. The biggest offenders were mismatched quotation marks and improperly placed commas. Also, many words are used improperly or are obviously the result of overzealous use of the \\"replace\\" button on a spell checker. It's clear that there was no independent reading done on this book before it went to press. Any competent reader would have spotted most of these errors just in a casual read through. <br /> <br />/Outlaw/ is a great book that provides a solid background for the Champions of Kamigawa set. If you can ignore the disturbingly frequent editing errors, you will be rewarded with a very enjoyable time exploring the world of Kamigawa. Despite being marred by the absence of good editing, this is a story well worth reading.	2004-10-17

Knowing this, I grabbed a copy of /Officer Candidate Tests/, as recommended by AFROTC and my own detachment. The book offers a good overview of the requirements for becoming an officer of any branch of the military, the hundreds of career paths available, what sort of degree and traits you need for a given field, a rough estimate of pay grades, etc. <br /> <br />The real meat of the book, though, and the reason most people will buy it, is the coverage of the various officer tests. I can't comment on how well this book prepares you for other branches of the military, but I can say that /Officer Candidate Tests/ is a good starting point for the AFOQT. There are hundreds of sample problems that give a good idea of what areas the real test covers. In fact, I found many of the samples to be a good deal more difficult than anything I had on the actual test -- a good thing, since if you can handle the subjects the book presents with reasonable competence, you know you will do fine on the real deal. <br /> <br />There are some significant drawbacks, however. Firstly, the book only covers the \\"academic aptitude\\" (verbal and math/logic skills) and electrical/mechanical comprehension portions of tests.  There's good material on the former and fairly skimpy preparation on the latter, but on the AFOQT, academic aptitude makes up only half of the exam. That's fine if you're not planning on being a pilot or navigator, but the remaining half of the test is rather critical for pilots. There's not even rudimentary descriptions of what the electrical maze, scale reading, instrument comprehension, block counting, and hidden figures questions are like. Again, if you are interested in being a pilot or navigator, that's a pretty large gap in knowledge to have when going into such an important test. <br /> <br />This isn't the world's best prep book, but I feel it was a big help in preparing me for the AFOQT, insofar as the half of the test it actually covered. I probably would have done better on the other sections if I had had any way of preparing. Even sections like the electrical maze, which are not something you can really \\"study\\" for, would have had a bit less shock value if I had at least seen an example or two. Then again, this is the military; you need to be able to handle some shock and pressure... <br /> <br />Bottom line - if you are wanting to become an officer, grab this book. It's decently priced, there's good info on career possibilities, and you'll get a feel for where you stand on the academic portions of a given officer test. Definitely a good starting point.	2004-09-24
US	41561242	R3DEAAJR5ZBDQ1	0892540907	13467033	Bhagavad Gita	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Good translation, lacking background material for us mortals	The Bhagavad-Gita is an intriguing and very wise book, even for those such as myself who do not really subscribe to an Indian philosophy or religion (indeed, I'm fascinated by some of the parallels between the Chinese concept of Tao and the Hindu concept of Brahman). This translation has a smooth feel to it, and while I am not able to comment on how precise this translation is, it flowed nicely and was enjoyable to read.<br />I do have one gripe, however: this book gets categorized as &quot;Religion&quot; (and indeed, that is what it says on the back cover), while this particular edition has a distinctly philosophical aim to it. The rendition of the Gita itself does not have this slant, but the other parts of the book do. The translator, Antonio de Nicolas, is a philosophy professor, and his foreward and introduction are rather heavy on academic philosophical mumbo-jumbo. I didn't realize when I bought this book that the subtitle, &quot;The Ethics of Decision-Making&quot;, meant &quot;ethics&quot; in the academic sense.<br />So while the Bhagavad-Gita itself is nicely presented here, the book spends a lot of space on philosophy rather than providing good background on the Gita's history and perhaps clarifying some of its more vague spots. This is why I only give the book 4 stars - the translation is topnotch, but the lack of background material can make for some puzzling moments that require the reader to go look something up online or in an encyclopedia. Other than that, I found this to be a handy addition to my library and a useful tool for exploring this amazing Eastern text.	2004-07-09

The page layouts and illustrations are first rate, and make for very enjoyable reading. Lillian manages to touch on just about every aspect of Chinese belief, including Taoist philosophy, Feng Shui, Buddhist meditation, the I Ching, Chinese astrology, the Eight Immortals, etc. Of course, covering such a broad range of subjects means that this book cannot go into detail on any of them. You won't become an expert on any of the subjects presented here. You will, however, gain a better appreciation for the wide range of beliefs and practices found in Chinese culture.<br />All in all, /Chinese Wisdom/ is a beautifully presented overview of some of the most important cultural elements of the Chinese. If you're interested in Chinese spiritual matters, but don't know where to begin, this book makes an excellent first step.	2004-07-04

This book is obviously meant to offer a guided tour of the evolution of written Chinese. So what if the naming isn't totally consistent? I'm not reading the book for names, and even if I was, I could easily look them up online to get a more &quot;proper&quot; spelling. Are such things niggles that count against the book? Yes. Are they even remotely significant drawbacks to the book as a whole? I would say no.<br />/Between Heaven and Earth/ offers us mere mortals a glimpse at the fascinating history of one of the most beautiful written languages on the planet. Sure, it is lacking in scholarly details, but that's absolutely not what this book is for. It is meant to be accessible and interesting, while offering a good understanding of the Chinese script's history.<br />I bought this book for a very simple reason: I am fascinated by Chinese, especially the script. But I am NOT a linguist! This is not an academic linguistic book, and it doesn't even try to be. That's specifically why I bought it! I wanted to kick back, relax, and absorb a bit of this lovely cultural treasure of China.<br />This is a great book, and I highly recommend it, little niggles and flaws aside. The calligraphy is beautiful, the overview information presented in each chapter is interesting and informative in a general way, and overall I had a really enjoyable time reading /Between Heaven and Earth/. No, it's not going to make you an expert on the minutiae of the historical details. But it will inform, entertain, and most of all, inspire further investigation and enjoyment of this wonderful language. For that, I heartily give this book a strong recommendation and a full five stars.	2004-06-22

When I grabbed a copy of /Beauty/, I was expecting a preachy book about some glorified ideal of beauty that us mere mortals cannot attain. I'm happy to report I was proven quite wrong in that expectation.<br />/Beauty/ is a hard book to classify - it's not a philosophy book, it's not a religion book, it just... is. It's like hopping on a tourist bus and cruising down the road of the beautiful, with John O'Donohue pointing out the sights along the way. &quot;To your left, you will see the beauty of light dancing across the sky at twilight. And to your right, the misty beams of sun's fading glory illuminating every crevice and boulder on the mountainside...&quot; You're not outright told what beauty is, per se. You are simply guided through the process of understanding beauty as not merely a characteristic, but as a force. O'Donohue illuminates what beauty *does* and where you might find it.<br />This is a magical, wonderful book. It is written in a relaxed and almost lyrical style - as a book on the beautiful should be. True beauty cannot be described by the mere words of men, but John O'Donohue does an admirable job of opening us up to &quot;the eternal grace and generosity of beauty's presence.&quot; That, in a nutshell, is what this book is all about.	2004-06-01

Considering the complexity of written Chinese, organization is everything. A secondary (but still very important) requirement for me was that whatever dictionary I ended up with be durable. Langenscheidt's pocket dictionary definitely fits the bill on both counts.<br />This dictionary has it all: a Chinese-English section ordered by pronunciation, an English-Chinese section featuring numerous usage examples for many words, an excellent radical index, a guide to common differences between mainland Chinese and the Chinese used in Taiwan, and an overview of numbers in Chinese. I'm especially pleased with the plentiful examples throughout the dictionary, which can eliminate much of the mystery of how to use the words/characters in a colloquial fashion.<br />All the entries are very clear and readable, and despite their size, the script characters are quite legible. If I had to pick something to complain about (and this is a bit of a stretch), it would be the lack of traditional Chinese characters in this dictionary. In my classes, we learn the traditional characters, but it is not a big deal to learn the simplified versions along the way (especially since out of the 100 or so characters covered each semester, only a handful differ between traditional and simplified Chinese).<br />What more can I say? This dictionary has it all as far as information goes, and the rubbery cover and excellent binding just scream &quot;durability&quot; to me. I have no doubt that this will be a tool I keep by my side for years to come, both in the classroom and in my travels to China itself. HIGHLY recommended.	2004-04-29

While there are many good academic, philosophical, and religious books on the subject, there is no substitute for actually applying Taoism to your own life. But if there was a book that came close to being such a substitute, it would be something like /Chronicles of Tao/.<br />This beautifully written book follows the life of Kwan Saihung, from his childhood beginnings with his rich and powerful family, to his dabbling and eventual immersion in Taoism. Deng Ming-Dao weaves the story in an expert fashion, and everything flows rather smoothly. This book is like a river, zigging and zagging through the events of Saihung's life. Every now and then, while following Saihung and his exploration of what it means to be a Taoist, the reader catches brief glimpses of the backdrop of events in China, such as the invasion by Japan. These tidbits provide good cultural background and are seamlessly woven into the story.<br />There are, of course, elements of the mystical and magical in this book. These add flavor to the story, and remind us that here is more to Taoism than sitting around and pondering riddles and the Yin-Yang symbol. Even if you don't believe that the Grand Master could truly light sticks of incense across the room simply with a hand gesture, you will be too busy enjoying the rest of /Chronicles/ to even care.<br />The long and short of it is that this is one of the best Taoism-related books I've ever read. And even if you're not all that interested in Eastern thought, there is much to enjoy here - after all, the story is a delight to read regardless of your philosophical or religious views. Short of hopping the next plane to China and secluding yourself in a cave or temple, this is a great way to get a taste for living, breathing Taoism.	2004-04-28

Not a very enlightened way for me to look at the book, but the title and the back cover details did little to convince me it was otherwise. Finally, out of sheer curiosity, I grabbed a copy of /The Tao of Abundance/ and took a closer look. I am very pleased to say that my initial (mis)judgement was rather off base.<br />Despite the unfortunate title, /The Tao of Abundance/ has a lot more to offer than one might think. The entire book is devoted to one seemingly simple idea: no matter how wealthy you may or may not be in material terms, if you don't have the spiritual foundation to support it, you cannot find true happiness. As many people can attest, this is a view that's easy to agree with, but difficult to apply to everyday life.<br />In this book, Laurence G. Boldt offers a framework for understanding what he calls the \\"chains of psychological poverty and lack.\\" As he says, our ego and conception of self vs. other keeps us from feeling spiritual abundance. Chapter by chapter, he guides the reader through the concepts, illuminating the various ways we can bring unhappiness upon ourselves. There are exercises to help see how these concepts apply to our own lives, and what we can do to improve the situations we find ourselves in.<br />/The Tao of Abundance/ is not about getting rich quick, but at the same time it is not a book of renunciation. This book is about learning to be happy, so that you can enjoy whatever level of material abundance you may have - or not. While a bit dry at times, it is nevertheless a good read with some intriguing insights. A lot of the ground covered here has been talked about in other books based on eastern thought, but /The Tao of Abundance/ approaches things from a refreshing direction. If you are interested in a rather Western guide to how to apply Taoist principles to your life, this book is certainly worth a look.	2004-04-19

It's a pretty good book, although I do have some reservations about it.<br />/Nonviolent Communication/ is a rather easy read. This is both good and bad - good, because you're not slogging through lots of academia-speak and technical jargon; but also bad because you might breeze through the book too quickly to truly absorb the rather useful and insightful information it is offering.<br />The idea behind the NVC process is rather simple - it's mostly about learning to be more precise in expressing your feelings, their cause(s), and what you would like done to resolve them. Rather than saying &quot;you never clean the !@#$ kitchen,&quot; the NVC approach would be to say something along the lines of: &quot;When you do not take out the trash in the kitchen, I feel __________.&quot; And so on. NVC also encourages you to be receptive to what other people are saying and feeling, even if (or perhaps especially if) they do not word things with as much precision and care.<br />The approach is very sound, but I have reservations about the way the book presents it. Most of the example conversations are so unbelievably robotic, at times I just wanted to laugh out loud at how absurd they were. My initial thought was that I was being unreasonable - after all, they're just words on a page, and perhaps they would seem less laughable in person with real emotion behind them. And then I realized that was the key that was missing - the conversations were little other than the facts of the situation, and the exact words the people said. There was no emotional context, no insight into the feelings that were being expressed. I found this to be extremely ironic. A book about expressing emotions, with lots of examples that HAD no emotion!<br />I think if you can get beyond the rather mediocre examples, and put genuine *thought* into the principles the author outlines, you will find much of value in the book. Before reading /Nonviolent Communication/, I didn't think much about how the imprecision in our wording can cause a great deal of conflict. &quot;You are so inconsiderate!&quot; versus &quot;When you leave your dirty dinner plate on the table and go watch football, I feel very angry. Would you please rinse the plate and put it in the dishwasher?&quot; It's a world of difference, and I believe there is much benefit to this approach.<br />Final thought: there's a lot of good stuff in this book, but the presentation could use some work. Read the book carefully, and do not go as quickly as the breezy writing style allows - the material here needs careful consideration for it to truly benefit you.	2004-04-07
US	41561242	R1LP1HF6UDYIF2	158542269X	524015341	Tao Te Ching: The Definitive Edition	Books	5	67	68	N	N	Truly wonderful way to explore the Tao Te Ching for yourself	One of the core ideas in Taoism (especially if you read a lot of Chuang-Tzu) is that there are infinite perspectives on anything and everything, and no one is more absolute or \\"correct\\" than the others. I think it's safe to say that the Tao Te Ching itself is an excellent example of this principle - just look at how many translations have been done, in various styles, approaching various perspectives on life, society, money, etc. And while there are certainly translations that speak to me far better than others do, I'd have to say that they are not always completely satisfying.<br />If you feel the same way, then Jonathan Star has come to your rescue with /Tao Te Ching: The Definitive Edition/. It starts out with an overview of Lao Tzu's work and the challenges that come with translating it. Then there is a rather good literary translation by the author, which sometimes takes a bit of artistic license - definitely not a bad thing. This is not the meat of the book, however. That part is the \\"definitive\\" translation itself - the literal translation. Every character of every chapter is provided, along with multiple possible meanings. Using this, you can compose your own interpretations of  your favorite chapters, or the whole book if you wish.<br />The literal translation is extremely well done, and provided in a very accessible format that provides a lot of information in an easy to use manner. If I had to pick something to gripe about, it would be the fact that the literal translation uses Wade-Giles instead of Pinyin (this from a book with a 2001 copyright). I suppose this was to keep things consistent with the similarly old-style spellings \\"Tao\\", \\"Lao-Tzu\\", etc. This niggle is mitigated a bit by the concordance section of the book, which includes translations from Wade-Giles to Pinyin. Not very convenient, but then again you probably won't be reading the literal translation for its phonetic qualities anyway. Like I said, that's basically the only gripe I can come up with.<br />Other juicy bits in the book: a section devoted totally to the different interpretations of the first chapter over the years, a summary of the many meanings used for each character throughout the Tao Te Ching, and a nice commentary on chapter one courtesy of Jonathan Star.<br />If you want to explore the Tao Te Ching as it speaks to *you* then this is definitely a book you want in your collection. As good a job as Jane English, Le Guin, et al have done with their respective translations, nothing can compare to the one that comes from your own spirit and heart. Thus, this truly is the definitive Tao Te Ching. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.	2004-03-26

On the one hand, /Scholar Warrior/ is a very well-constructed, illustrated guide to various aspects of Taoist life and philosophy. On the other hand, some of the guidelines Deng Ming-Dao presents as &quot;essential&quot; to this way of life not only run contradictory to the Taoist ideal of wu-wei (non-action), but also contrary to a number of ideas the author himself states are important.<br />In /Scholar Warrior/, the reader is told both that the Taoist does not strive forcefully and instead flows naturally with life (wu-wei). Yet, there is much detail on how to meticulously plan the stages of your life from the present until the day you die. There's also a great deal of advice on striving to eliminate your &quot;fatal flaw&quot; - yet, if such a &quot;flaw&quot; exists, is it not a natural part of yourself and thus, a manifestation of the perfect Tao? I suppose the idea here is that all this advice is presented as a guide to the &quot;natural&quot; way that others have discovered - but isn't one of the core ideas behind Taoism that each must find their own unique way on the Way? This book seems too heavily centered on goals, which strikes me as very un-Taoist.<br />There's a lot of good information in this book, but there is also a lot that is simply not very usable. The sections on herbology, meditation, and the philosophies of Taoism seem very well done. However, a tremendous amount of space in the book is spent on Qigong, for example. The illustrations and descriptions are quite good, but this ignores a fundamental problem: you can't learn Qigong by gawking at illustrations in a book, and there's far too many steps involved to remember them with any effectiveness. So despite the quality of these parts of the book, they are ultimately not very useful.<br />I don't really mean to bash this book so much - there is a lot of good information in it, and it can inspire you to explore different branches of the Taoist path in more detail. The breadth and depth of this work is admirable, it's just a shame that a lot of it is very contradictory or not all that useful in the end. I'm glad I bought /Schollar Warrior/ though, and for one simple reason: it has inspired me to think more carefully about what my own path means for me. In that regard, it was a worthwhile purchase. Just be sure to approach this book with an eye out for contradictions, so you can figure out what the right direction is for *you*	2004-03-15

The book moves on to offer an overview of key Taoist concepts like wu-wei, de, the yin-yang polarity, etc. All of this is done in a relaxed, enjoyable manner, making for a quick and fun read.<br />This /Idiot's Guide/ also has chapters on Taoist thoughts on nature, skill, and life and death. These chapters illuminate the Taoist perspective on many aspects of life, and do so a lot more effectively than a list of dry, fixed &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;shall not&quot; items would be able to. The book also includes some thought-provoking overviews of the links between Taoism and Christianity, modern physics, popular culture (i.e. The Matrix), and so forth.<br />This book is not page after page of dogmatic rules on how you should or should not think, or should or should not live. Anyone looking for such things will be disappointed with /The Complete Idiot's Guide to Taoism/, and indeed Taoism itself. The authors went to great lengths to provide a cohesive intro to the history of Taoism, as well as the core ideas that make it a viable philosophy (or religion) to this day. I think the main goal when writing this book was to get the reader to actively *think* about life, and how traditional Taoist perspectives match up with the experiences of daily life.<br />If you're up to the challenge of genuinely thinking about Taoism, and how it can be applied to all aspects of the world, this book will definitely satisfy you. As the authors say in their introduction, &quot;Think of /The Complete Idiot's Guide to Taoism/ as a flashlight; judge its effectiveness by what it helps you see more clearly as you make your own way along the path.&quot;	2004-03-07

A lot of what is presented in this book is not really Zen or Buddhist at all, with the author preferring to cover a variety of subjects on wellness - both physical and spiritual. Most of the material *is* inspired by Eastern technique and philosophy though.<br />A diverse range of topics are covered, in 'lite' detail: tai chi, physical and emotional self-tests, qi gong (chi kung), meditation, the &quot;Alexander Technique&quot; for back pain problems, and so forth. Each of these topics is interspersed amongst the eightfold path of Buddhism, but in a lot of cases the exercises and techniques detailed have little or nothing to do with the part of the path being highlighted.<br />If you are looking for a general handbook on how to improve various aspects of your life, /Zen and the Art of Well Being/ is indeed a good starting point. It offers a gentle introduction to discovering where you are and where you can go, in terms of body, mind, and spirit. You won't become a Zen master from reading this book, but you will learn how to relax and get more out of your life. In the end, that's probably a lot more useful than becoming a Zen master anyway.	2004-02-27
US	41561242	R1P7HD10A21RRJ	0195219333	74550191	Taoism	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Short, to the point - a good academic overview of Taoism	This book, just over 100 pages of actual content, is first and foremost an academic look at religious Taoism. /Taoism/ provides a broad (but not very deep) overview of the history, beliefs, sacred places, peoples, and texts, and so forth. A lot of territory is covered, just not in great detail. Excerpts sprinkled throughout the book provide nice exposure to some classic Taoist texts. The whole thing is pretty lightweight and a breeze to read - I finished the book in an hour or so of reading.<br />As I said, this is primarily an academic look at Taoism, and it is mostly interested in the religious beliefs therein. The author is careful not to judge the religion or get into messy contrasts with Western religions, which I think is a fairly safe approach. However, this is definitely not a book to read if you are interested in details on the principles of Taoism as they might be applied in your daily life. /Taoism/ is a good place to start when researching the religious side of the followers of the Tao, but that's about it.	2004-02-26

They are often the books I turn to first on technical subjects, and /AppleScript: The Definitive Guide/ is no exception in that regard. Matt Neuburg has a relaxed writing style that makes this guide enjoyable to read, insofar as reference books are enjoyable to any degree. He makes a point of going into detail about the quirks of AppleScript (of which there are tons), explaining workarounds when possible, the potential problems these quirks can cause, etc. Neuburg also is not shy about admitting his puzzlement at some of the particularly odd and inexplicable aspects of the AppleScript language.<br />There's a great deal of information on a wide range of topics: the architecture of the language, the mindset you need when coding with AppleScript, how to combine your AppleScripts with other languages (such as Perl), how to use AppleScript studio to create GUI apps, and tons more. /AppleScript: The Definitive Guide/ has an excellent index, and I've yet to encounter a situation when the bit of info I needed couldn't be found quickly in this book.<br />Ultimately, AppleScript books tend to fall into one of two categories. There are those that are primarily aimed at telling you how to automate specific apps (the Finder, for example) and not much else. Such books are unfortunately too common, and many of them are sorely outdated (usually covering not much after Mac OS 9, which is fairly useless now). At the other end of the spectrum are those that aim to teach you the language, its ups and its downs, its godsends and its bizarre oddities. /AppleScript: The Definitive Guide/ falls into the latter category, and this is its strongest feature.<br />As the author points out, AppleScript is a very quirky language, and you never really &quot;learn&quot; all of it, or even the majority of it. There's so many hacks and poorly (or un-) documented applications, it would take a lifetime to truly masterevery aspect of AppleScript. Fortunately Matt Neuburg has come to the rescue with this excellent reference. It surely deserves a place on the bookshelf of any Mac developer or power user.	2004-02-15

I'm not at all disappointed with the book, but I feel I should warn potential buyers that this is not necessarily the best book to start with.<br />The authors start out with basic drawing theory, left brain vs. right brain, etc. and a few exercises to help you understand how best to approach drawing in general. They move on to talk about different types of paper, pencils, the picture plane, viewfinder, and other tools for drawing - very useful and well thought out information. Then the book jumps into various ideas for what to draw, what perspectives to try, etc.<br />If you're thinking it sounds like something has been left out, you're right. While /Idiot's Guide to Drawing/ covers a lot of tools and drawing ideas, it doesn't offer much in the way of exercises or practical advice for actually _drawing_. So while you may be inspired by, say, the section on still life drawings, you will find very little in the way to help you practice.<br />So what it comes down to is this: if you've dabbled a bit in drawing and aren't afraid of experimentation, this is an excellent book. Lots of good stuff in here, and great ideas for where you might want to point your creativity. But as I said, there aren't very many guided exercises in the book to help you explore the concepts you see and get any decent amount of feedback. Some would argue that lots of little exercises are silly or pointless, but I think they can be great confidence builders for those of us who tend to be overly critical of our own artwork... Or those of us who expect far too much from ourselves early on.<br />I highly recommend this book - but with a strong suggestion that you start with one or two more basic drawing books (like /Drawing for Dummies/), unless you want to do a great deal of experimentation on your own.	2004-02-02

I am pleased to say this book falls into neither of those categories, and instead fits into a more enjoyable one: the kind of book that helps you learn to live better.<br />This is not a book about Zen history, or extensive rules for how to &quot;properly&quot; meditate. As the title states, this is a book about Zen *living*. It is like a flash light, which you can shine into the darkest corners of your mind and use as a guide to simplifying the psychological and emotional clutter therein. The authors have filled this book with many practical examples of how a Zen perspective can ease your mental burden and allow you to get more out of each moment.<br />If you're looking for lots of dry, philosophical blather, this is not the book for you. But if you are genuinely interested in gaining a new perspective on life, and learning how simple it can be to live in a more satisfying way, you've definitely come to the right place. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to clean out the dusty attic of the mind.	2003-12-26

The mind (and heart) is seemingly forever tangled in a web of doubt, what-ifs, and events that exist mostly or entirely in one's head. As Mark Twain put it,  &quot;My life has been full of terrible misfortunes, most of which never happened.&quot;<br />That, in essence, is what /Radical Acceptance/ is about, but it goes above and beyond the seemingly brief gloss-over treatment traditional western Buddhist books give this subject. Tara Brach has crafted an amazing book that opens your eyes to just how much suffering we tend to bring upon ourselves. Despite the very serious nature of what this book deals with, it is a delight to read. With each turn of the page, you begin to see more and more clearly. It's like having a compassionate, age-old friend guide you down the road of your own emotions and thoughts.<br />If you take the time to truly digest what /Radical Acceptance/ is all about, I can guarantee it will change you forever. My brief description here cannot do it justice by any measure - just as the storytelling and strategizing of the mind cannot do justice to the vibrant reality of the world. You might think a book about suffering and self-delusion would be depressing, but it is entirely the opposite. It's like suddenly being able to see with clarity after being caught up in a dense fog for so long. And that, I believe, is the highest praise you can give any book.	2003-11-19

With /Zhuangzi Speaks/, Tsai Chih Chung has given us a great gift. I must admit that I initially had low expectations for a cartoon version of Chuang-Tzu's writings. After having read through it, however, I say with confidence that this is truly a wonderful book that makes the sometimes puzzling Taoist principles much easier to understand.<br />/Zhuangzi Speaks/ is definitely worth a read by fledgling and long-time Taoists alike, as well as their loved ones (who may not understand much about the Tao), and anyone else who is even the least bit curious about Chuang-Tzu and his ideas.	2003-11-09

It can seem to be a very daunting topic to the newcomer who is not very familiar with Eastern traditions. Fortunately, Jean Smith comes to the rescue with this expertly crafted guide to the core principles of Buddhism. Reading this book is like having an old friend take you by the hand and gently walk you through the world, opening your eyes to the way things truly are. Jean's style of writing is both relaxed and wise, and each chapter is filled with quotations, stories, and analogies to help your mind (and heart) grasp the various aspects of the Eightfold Path.<br />There is much wisdom between these two covers. If you've ever been mystified by Buddhism, I highly recommend this book above all others as your starting point.	2003-08-04

Morality, wisdom, compassion - these are the building blocks for a meaningful life, and the keys to them are contained in the Dalai Lama's words within this book. Drawing on his experiences and the traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, /How to Practice/ is your guide to becoming a more compassionate and, ultimately, more content person.<br />You won't find the meaning of life in this book, nor will you find a step-by-step guide to what you should think and feel every day. This book is like a raft, meant to carry you from the shores of anger and preconceptions to the shores of wisdom. It takes careful (and sometimes repeated) reading of this book to digest the ideas within, and each time you read it you will discover something new. This book will inspire you, it will make you think, and if you let it it will change your life for the better.<br />Whether you are a Buddhist or not, the core ideas in this book transcend religion, race, and culture. Everybody can read /How to Practice/ and take something away from it to help them become a better person and, in turn, make the world a little bit better as a whole.<br />Looking for a quick fix for happiness?

When I first read &quot;Awakening the Buddha Within&quot;, my mind (and heart) were not ready for it. I got perhaps 100 pages into it and could not bring myself to read any further, because it felt like I was trying to make headway in the face of an ever-increasingly powerful headwind that eventually brought me to a halt.<br />Don't get me wrong - this is a wonderfully written and very enjoyable book on Buddhism, especially Tibetan Buddhism. I only recently began my spiritual exploration, and this book has aided me much. However I absolutely do not recommend this to the average American who, perhaps like me, is not yet ready for the simple truths contained within. For those who have not yet uncovered their spiritual self, this is not the book to start with. You'll just end up piling conceptualizations onto it, and convince yourself that you've wasted your time reading it.<br />My recommendation is that you read &quot;Awakening to the Sacred&quot; (also by Lama Surya Das) first. Buy it, or get it from the library. Read it, live it, and learn more about yourself and the spirit that dwells within you. &quot;Awakening to the Sacred&quot; will help you to discover your true self, and then you will be ready for this book. Only after your true self is revealed can true knowledge be accepted, and so it is with &quot;Awakening the Buddha Within&quot;.	2003-05-27

He merely describes the beliefs, techniques, and background, and allows you to decide for yourself. Even if you don't buy into the idea of reincarnation, for example, at the very least Surya will get you thinking about the possibilities.<br />This book is essentially a guide for those who wish to custom craft their own spiritual life. It allows you to decide how best to discover truth, and to discover yourself. Don't think this is a Buddhist book, because it is not. The lessons you take away from &quot;Awakening to the Sacred&quot; can be integrated into any lifestyle. You may not find yourself meditating at dawn and chanting while you shower, but you will certainly learn something about yourself as you journey through this book.<br />Definitely a must-read for those seeking truth and happiness.	2003-05-12

One thing that attracted me to this book was the author made a point of sidestepping the \\"cultural trappings\\" of Buddhism in favor of a down-to-earth explanation of the core concepts.<br />As I read through this book, I kept thinking to myself... \\"This is too simple! Why does he keep rehashing the same basic stuff over and over again?\\" By the time I got to the end, I had my answer. Buddhism, at its core, is really that simple. It's all about being aware, about being here and now. I initially wondered why the author seemed to resist going into detailed explanations, but then I realized that's because no detail is necessary.<br />This book is refreshing and enjoyable to read. Mr. Hagen has an engaging style that he uses very effectively to drive home the basics of Buddhism. I can think of no drawbacks to this book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about this intriguing religion (or simply life philosophy, depending on how far you wish to take it).	2003-04-30

I like to study languages of various sorts, not necessarily to become fluent in them, but simply to learn about them and think about them. Latin is certainly one of the more interesting languages to study, if not because one finds it fascinating in itself (which I do), then because it has influenced modern languages so much.<br />Veni, Vidi, Vici is a great book to open to a random page and read for a few minutes. And it's rather amusing to throw around Latin phrases such as &quot;Mars gravior sub pace lacet&quot; (&quot;a more serious war lies hidden in peace&quot;) to see how people react.<br />Whether or not you are interested in actually learning Latin, this is a very interesting and fun book to read. If nothing else, it can get your mind thinking about just how pervasive Latin roots are in the language we speak today. If you are a fellow helluo librorum (&quot;devourer of books&quot;), you will definitely like Veni, Vidi, Vici.	2003-03-19

Kim walks you through the rules at a comfortable (but reasonably quick) pace, and explains some of the general strategy. Unfortunately, that's basically where the book stops. I went through the whole thing in a short sitting, which is a testament both to its enjoyable style and featherweight content.<br />This book is well-written and fun to read, but if you already know the general idea of how to play, you won't find anything useful here. Anyone but absolute beginners would do well to skip this and start with Volume II in the series.	2003-02-13

This is an excellent book for learning how to use the powerful tools and features in Illustrator. However, don't expect to find any artistic theory or design tips in this book. This is strictly a point-A-to-point-B instructional book that presents (relatively) enjoyable exercises to learn your way around, and not an ounce more.<br />The author accomplishes the task of training you in the use of Illustrator. But just as a book on Microsoft Word will not make you a good writer, don't expect this book to make you a graphic design guru. :)	2003-02-13

There's lots of little tips and tricks for newbies and long-time Mac users alike, and the book never talks down to the reader. The style of writing is very easy to read (and enjoyable too), with lots of screen captures to help you see the steps involved. Brief interludes on the history of various aspects of the Macintosh world are also interspersed throughout the book, adding background as to why features are there (or not).<br />One thing that is really refreshing about this book is that it is downright honest. Mac OS X is certainly not perfect, and it has its share of little glitches, flaws, and annoyances. Pogue comes out and mentions these up front, with no BS. And instead of just griping about it, he includes workarounds (official or otherwise) when they exist. He is obviously very excited and proud of OS X (as well he should be), and this enthusiasm is rather contagious. But he doesn't kid the reader about where the OS is less than stellar.<br />Enough blathering - I can sum up this book in one sentence: Whether you're new to the world of Macs (or computers in general), or someone who knows what 'dogcow' is, this book has lots of good stuff you can make use of. Buy it. Buy it NOW. :)	2003-01-05

It's nice to pick it up and casually read some of the proverbs. Even if I'm not yet skilled enough to fully make use of all the strategies and tactics outlined in the book, just the general concepts I take away from reading it are invaluable. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about the ins and outs of Go.	2002-08-29
