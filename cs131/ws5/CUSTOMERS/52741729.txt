I'm using this book for a lab section of GeoComputation, and after working through the first few exercises and looking through the rest of the book, I am impressed.<br />The CD included with the book contains all of the data you'll need to complete the exercises. I found Burke's writing to be fluid and insightful. Each chapter begins with a good overview and background of what will be done. There are many diagrams, as well, so you can see the expected results.<br />This isn't a programming book in the C++ range. It is a book detailing how to customize and make ArcView 8.x work for you using Visual Basic for Applications. Recommended. Enjoy	2004-01-24

(Contributions to Southern Appalachian Studies) (Contributions to Southern Appalachian Studies, 8)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Essential for those interested in Appalachian Studies	The stories of Cratis Williams are essential for the getting a glimpse of Appalachia. He is/was indeed the leading spokesperson and scholar of life in the Applachian Mountains. These stories deal mostly with his childhood growing up in rural Eastern Kentucky. These stories are unforgettable and profound.<br />Cratis Williams eventually came to Boone, North Carolina to teach school. He returned again after receiving his Ph.D. from New York University. Appalachian State University's graduate school is named for him.<br />&quot;The Cratis Williams Chronicles: I Come to Boone&quot; is another book that goes into detail about his coming to the high country of North Carolina. Highly Recommended.<br />If you're at all interested in peeling back the stereotypical images of Appalachia and peering into a region with soul and character, give Cratis Williams a read.	2004-01-24

I finally picked up \\"Skinny Legs and All\\" after hearing how much I had to read one of his books.<br />It does not disappoint. The story and characters are so absurdly comedic that it's impossible not to fall in love with them. Following Ellen Cherry and Boomer's romance across the country was a delight. How does a waitress working in a resurant owned by an Arab and Jew manage to find true love with a guy who is an unrealized artist? What does a sentient sock, can of beans, conch shell, and silver spoon's journey to Jerusalem have to do with it all? You'll have to read and find out.<br />I'm currently reading Robbins's \\"Still Life With Woodpecker\\" and it is as witty and stylish as Skinny Legs..in fact, read 'em both. Every page will be savored.	2002-10-14

I found it at a local bookstore and snatched it up immediately. It's a gorgeous book at nearly 800 pages. It has a black cover with a classic image of Dali and his mustache ends sticking straight up on the cover.<br />The real meat of the book is the paintings, drawings, and sketches. Over 1600 of them to be exact, almost all of them produced in vivid color. The book progresses year to year, giving a glimpse into Dali's changing techniques and styles. Thoughtful commentary by Robert Descharnes and Gilles Neret compliment the works of art.<br />Overall this is one of the best and most comprehensive Dali books around. A must for any serious Dali fan, or even the casual admirer.	2002-01-01

Last semester in college I had the opportunity, for the first time, to read various chapters from Herman Melville's &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. I became so enthralled with what I had read I decided to purchase the novel as soon as possible. I just so happened to pick up Penguin's 150th Anniversary Edition. All in all I am quite pleased with this edition from the cover to the pages that are printed clearly and crisply.<br />Moby Dick may not be everyone's cup of tea, it can be rather long and tedious to get through as Melville likes to lecture almost as much as tell a story. But from the first line &quot;Call me Ishmael&quot; it's hard not to be sucked into the story as we follow Ishmael on his journey across the sea with the nefarious Captain Ahab. The story centers around Ahab's quest to find and destroy the White Whale. Of course Ishmael plays just as important of a part.<br />Melville's use of language is spectacular and he truly did write a classic novel. This is a fascinating tale of adventure that shouldn't be missed.	2002-01-01

If you've read The Wastland or any of the other, more substantial poems by T.S Eliot, you may be shocked at Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. But don't be fooled, even in the simple subject matter there is genius in Eliot's writing.<br />This is the only poem book of Eliot's that I own and it's a great deal of fun to read. My favorite cat is Macavity. If you've seen the musical Cats (which I haven't), here's the inspiration. This is also a great first book to get younger people interested in poetry. The language Eliot uses is flowery and catchy, and the subject matter is centered on those cute furballs. Enjoy.	2001-06-12

While this may be true in some aspects, there are a few books that are somewhat easier to read while keeping intact all that is William Faulkner. Light in August is one of those novels.<br />Light in August is a long read, over five hundred pages, but it is worthwhile. Faulkner ties together a group of unforgettable characters into a story that shows the range of human emotions. Lena Grove, a pregnant girl from Alabama, who has come to Jefferson looking for her soon to be husband. Byron Bunch, a hard working man at a planing mill, who ends up falling for Lena. Gail Hightower, a former minister, who seems to have forsaken religion to sit in the study of his house, gazing from the window. And Joe Christmas, a man who is caught between two races (black and white), and struggles to find his identity.<br />A large portion of the novel centers on Joe Christmas and while reading the story I ran through a range of emotions regarding him. He can be both kind and sinister. I liked Bunch most of all. He is a simple man, shallow on the exterior but deep in understanding and compassion, who is just trying to do the right thing. Aren't most of us?<br />So what befalls these characters? How does their story end? It's rather easy to find out. Give Light in August a try and you'll be swept away into one of those stories that William Faulkner seems to do best....Enjoy.	2001-06-12

I'll be the first to admit I had never heard of Alex Grey before. However, I am a fan of the music group Tool. The artwork on their new CD was done by Alex Grey. I never paid this much mind until I was in a book store a couple weeks ago and passed right by &quot;Sacred Mirrors&quot;. I stopped, turned around, snatched it up and ran to the counter. Upon further reading I must say it is phenomenal..<br />The essays presented talk about Alex and his work. They provide an indepth look at his philosophies on transcendence. While enjoyable to read the real reason to buy the book is the art. I have never seen anything quite like Grey's work. It is bold and bright. His use of colors and their correspondence in the human body are simply amazing.<br />This book is definitely recommended for anyone who wants to view the human body; our physical, mental, and most importantly, our spiritual side, in a whole new light.	2001-05-29

Wouldn't it be great if there was a book that tied the two together? Thankfully there is. &quot;The Civil War in North Carolina&quot; by John Barrett.<br />While no major battles of the Civil War were fought in North Carolina, the state did see its share of skirmishes. In striking detail, this book covers the beginning of the war until it's conclusion. It's truly fascinating to read about the places and events that took place one hundred and forty years ago.<br />The research by Barrett in constructing an acurate view of the state during the war is top notch. A lot of footnotes accompany the text. A highly recommended and worthwhile read for both Civil War and history buffs of the Tar Heel state.	2001-05-29

I'll go a bit farther than the reader from Farmer's Market, CA and say this is the sixth essential book.<br />Houghton Mifflin also recently published  &quot;The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien&quot; and it makes a great companion  volume to this one.<br />There's not much more I can add to the three reviews  before mine, they summed it all up quite nicely. This is a well written and  detailed book and a must read for any Tolkien fan. It's not that long  either, clocking in at just over three hundred pages.<br />Tolkien is an  inspiring man who chronicled (I won't say created as Tolkien himself said  he only transcribed the works of Middle-Earth) one of the best loved sagas  ever written. With the new Hobbit and Lord of the Rings box set, the  Letters and this biography HMC is doing him justice and producing beautiful  renditions of each that should be on everyone's bookshelf.	2000-07-12

Now with the reprinting of his letters by Houghton Mifflin all those who cherish his writings are able to learn a bit more about the man  who shaped Middle-Earth.<br />Reading this book you can't help but think what  a warm and charming man he was. His letters are thoughtful, intelligent and  often amusing as he converses with the publishers Allen and Unwin, his sons  Michael and Christopher, C.S. Lewis, and even fans from around the world  who sent him questions and observations. It's reading history and it's  fascinating.<br />A large and rather comprehensive index is included near the  end of the book with plenty of notes about each letter and the people and  places contained within.<br />Highly recommended for anyone wanting a deeper  glimpse into the thoughts of a brilliant man.	2000-07-12

As previously stated, please read the books in the originalpublished order, a more enjoyable experience for sure.

A friend of mine told me about them and for the next two weeks she read &quot;The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe&quot; to me over the phone. I was twenty-two years old at the time and I couldn't help but be excited when it was time for the next chapter.<br />I'm two years older now and I own my own set. The Chronicles of Narnia are some of the best books I've ever read. On any level. There's something in Narnia for everyone, from a child to an adult these books can enrich and bring joy to a rather ordinary existence.<br />This set along with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings sweep me off to magical lands and fantastic adventures. Sometimes it's like I never want to come back....thank you C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.	2000-07-09

As a few have stated already, a lot of Emily Dickinson's poems appear simple on the surface. Don't let the simplicity or brevity fool you, boiling underneath the metaphors of Dickinson's poems are some of the most  beautiful visions I've ever read. Intelligent, thoughtful..haunting are all  words I'd use to describe her poems. She has quickly vaulted to the top of  the list of my favorite poets along with William Blake and Edgar Allan  Poe.<br />And speaking of her poems, there are plenty. All of them in fact, in  chronological order allowing the reader to see the progession in her poems.  This is a great book at a great price to be able to own all she has  written.<br />Since her poems have no titles, there are two invaluable  features included at the back to help aid the search for the desired poem.  One is an alphabetical subject index, with words and lines linked to poems  with which they belong. The other index includes the first lines of all  1775 poems.<br />An excellent all around souce for all your Emily Dickinson  needs. Enjoy.	2000-07-01

Valaquenta also lays the groundwork for the  betrayal that Melkor would exact on his fellow Valar, forever after being  called Morgoth (the first Dark Lord) by the Elves.<br />The Quenta  Silmarillion is the largest and most detailed of the stories. Herein lies  the story of the beginning days, the coming of the Elves, the making of the  Silmarils by Feanor, and their theft by Melkor.

Kafkaesque: Impenetrably oppresive or nightmarish, as in the fiction of Franz Kafka.<br />Indeed, &quot;The Trial&quot; is the epitome of this adjective used to describe the haunting novels of Franz Kafka.<br />Breon  Mitchell's translation is fantastic as it expands and clarifies the first  version by the Muirs. A lengthy translators preface is included, written by  Mitchell, explaining the reasoning for this new translation based on the  German definitive edition. Various examples of the text (in German) are  also used in the explanations of the hows and whys.<br />On to the story  itself. Josef K. awakens one more to find that he's been arrested. He  doesn't know why and is never told. His daily life is allowed to go on over  the course of the year the novel takes place, while trying to understand  what is happening. Throughout this process Josef begins to sink further  into paranoia and guilt, with the fate of his life in the  balance....<br />This is a deep and dense novel, with various interpretations.  It's scary to realize that this could actually happen (perhaps not on this  scale) and that's one of things Kafka excels at. Taking the everyday  mundane and catapulting it into the realm of the absurd and  nightmarish..<br />The leftover fragments of &quot;The Trial&quot; are also  included after the story, adding further insight into this tragic story.  It's also worth it to pick up the Muir's translation, to see the  differences, and to have the original english version to keep.<br />A must  read.	2000-04-17

This version of the Divine Comedy contains all three sections, Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradiso. This poem is a masterpiece to be savored and surprisingly it's not as difficult to read as one might think.<br />Ample  notes and diagrams are provided throughout all three sections, and before  each Canto (Chapter) a synopsis is provided detailing what just happened  and what is going to happen next. A very nice addition that will help in  comprehension of the poem.<br />The descriptions of Dante's Hell, Purgatory  and later Heaven are breathtaking. Each section can be read seperately and  enjoyed as is but combined they provide a brilliantly realized journey.	2000-04-13

The book has been divided into six sections, each one covering the poets of a different dynasty.<br />The poems themselves are beautiful,  simple yet complex, elegant. The words just seem to flow from the pages. A  delightful reading experience.<br />&quot;as I wonder aimlessly under a frozen  moon a flute poors its beauty from a nearby tower. then morning breezes  begin to rise and gust -  the river already a carpet of scattered white  blossoms.&quot; --Kuan Hsiu	2000-04-08

Jack Kerouac wanted to be known as a jazz poet and with this poem he proves that he is. Mexico City Blues is one of my favorite Kerouac books and a lot of fun to read.<br />The 242 Choruses are free-spirited and  spontaneous, almost like they've been written just before you turn the  page. If you've read and enjoyed &quot;On the Road&quot; or &quot;The  Dharma Bums&quot; pick this one up and enjoy.<br />A little Miles Davis, John  Coltrane, or Charlie Parker playing in the background will add a whole new  dimension.

Of course this is required reading for the Kafka enthusiast.<br />A well thought-out forward by John Updike prepares you for your journey into the amazing and complex mind of Kafka. The book is  divided into two sections, one for the longer stories and one for the  shorter stories (most of which only take up a page or two).<br />The stories  themselves are great. &quot;The Metamorphisis&quot; is included, in which  Gregor Samsa awakens to find himself in the form of a rather large insect!  &quot;The Penal Colony&quot;, &quot;The Judgment&quot; and &quot;A Country  Doctor&quot; are also included.<br />There's certainly hasn't been an author  since Kafka able to play upon the fears and emotions of the human mind,  those thoughts playing in out head, when we realize that maybe some of this  could happen to us.<br />If you enjoy &quot;The Complete Stories&quot;, be  sure to pick up &quot;Amerika&quot;, &quot;The Castle&quot; and &quot;The  Trial&quot;. These are Kafka's three novels and will complete your  collection. All very much worth it!	2000-04-03

Helping a stoker who feels he's being treated  unfairly, he (Karl) happens to find his Uncle Jacob on the boat. The very  Uncle Jacob who was waiting for his arrival!<br />So it's the cushy life for  Karl right? Weeeell, not exactly. It starts out that way but eventually  Karl ends up on his own.<br />&quot;Amerika&quot; has more humor in it than  Kafka's other novels and it may have you chuckling and cheering for Karl on  his journey. It did me.<br />What happens to Karl and how exactly does he end  up in Oklahoma? You're going to have to read the book to find that out. Oh,  and make sure to notice all the &quot;cramped&quot; situations Karl gets  stuck in. Very amusing!	2000-04-03

I've been a huge Edgar Allan Poe fan for a long time and believe he's one of the greatest authors ever. While not having this exact edition, I have one similiar. Knowing it contains all his stories and poems, you definitely  can't go wrong picking this book up. It'll keep you busy for a long  time.<br />Want a tale of mystery, deduction? Flip to &quot;The Gold Bug&quot;  or &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;.<br />Horror? &quot;The Pit and  the Pendulum&quot;, &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; and &quot;The  Oblong Box&quot; will fit the bill.<br />Imagination? &quot;The Island of the  Fay&quot;, &quot;The Sphinx&quot;.<br />Satire and Hoaxes? &quot;The Devil in  the Belfry&quot;, &quot;Mystification&quot; and &quot;Loss of Breath&quot;  for starters.<br />These few stories are just the tip of the iceberg. Don't  forget all his poems, including the classic &quot;The Raven&quot;.  &quot;Alone&quot; is another of my favorite poems.<br />Poe is a master of  storytelling and this book will show it. Highly Recommended.	2000-04-02

I pretty much picked &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; on a whim and I'm glad I did. As the reviewer before me, William, stated this book has so much depth. Beauty that is revealed as the story progresses.<br />Yes, I found it difficult at the beginning. Benjy's narrative flings itself far and  wide, twisting and turning. You may get lost, but keep reading! Next you'll  come to Quentin's tragic narrative, which takes place some 18 years  earlier. The pieces of the Compson family puzzle began to finally come  together.<br />Jason, the cynical brother, is next. All three brothers recall  extensively their feelings and thoughts on their sister Caddy, who has no  narrative, but is profoundly present the whole time. Finally Dilsey, the  black servant, has the final chapter. Through each narrative the story and  writing become more coherent. A truly worthwhile read to savor and  enjoy.<br />If all else fails, I've found a few Faulker study guides on the  net. Great resources to help you get more out of his rich and satisfying  novels.	2000-04-02

Sure, the Unabridged William Shakespeare tends be a bit unwieldy, and the text a bit small, but I suppose it would be as it contains everything the playwright and poet has written.<br />Having those two minor negatives in mind, this is still a very nice version to have sitting on your bookshelf.  It has everything in one package and it's easy to pull down, flip to any  page and start reading.<br />A few excellent features of the this volume are  the index of all the characters from every play, a full glossary of  Elizabethan English, notes on plays and even the first line of every sonnet  for easy reference.<br />It's worth it to pick this one up and to enjoy at  leisure.	2000-04-02

I'm not a Buddhist and you don't have to be to glean an ounce of wisdom from these pages. The Buddha's words can apply to anyone and everyone who reads  with an open mind and heart.<br />Easwaran begins with a fantastic, lengthy,  introduction detailing the Buddha's life. The concepts of Karma, Dharma and  Nirvana are also explained.<br />The Bhudda's words are comprised in 25  chapters, grouped by topic. Each chapter recieves an introduction by  Stephen Ruppenthal.<br />If you enjoy this version of &quot;The  Dhammapada&quot;, might I also recommend &quot;The Bhagavad Gita&quot; and  the &quot;Upanishads&quot;, also by Easwaran. These two books provide a  wonderful spiritual and philosophic look into the Hindu religion.	2000-03-24

Commentary by Deng Mind-Dao is thought  provoking and enlightening.<br />A nice feature included is the appendix,  showing which meditation to read on each day. Great idea for people who  didn't start on the 1st of the year. It's also further divided into the  Northern and Southern Hemispheres.<br />The perfect companion to start each  day.	2000-03-23

I picked Stephen Mitchell's version of the Tao Te Ching after reading the Feng-English translation.<br />After reading some of the more negative reviews I wasn't sure what to expect, but I ended up being pleasantly  surprised.<br />This version is easy to read and understand, clearing up the  more esoteric passages from the traditional translations, without diluting  the underlying meaning and inspiration.<br />I still prefer the Feng-English  translation for it's poetic style and mysticism, but Mitchell's version is  still ideal to enjoy and ponder the meaning of the Tao.	2000-03-23

Martin Palmer begins the book with a well written and educational preface and introduction going into the details of his translation and the Taoist concepts and ideas in the book.<br />He  states: &quot;The Book of Chuang Tzu is like a travelogue. As such, it  meanders between continents, pauses to discuss diet, gives exchange rates,  breaks off to speculate, offers a bus timetable, tells an amusing incident,  quotes from poetry, relates a story, cites scripture.&quot;<br />&quot;And  always listen out for the mocking laughter of Chuang Tzu. This can be heard  most when you start to make grand schemes out of the bits, or wondrous  philosophies out of the hints and jokes. For ultimately this is not one  book but a variety of voices swapping stories and bouncing ideas off each  other, with Chuang Tzu striding through the whole, joking, laughing,  arguing and interrupting.&quot;<br />Indeed the Chuang Tzu does all these  things. Providing a fascinating and enlightening glimpse, using heavy doses  of humor and wit, into the path of Tao. Experience is all.	2000-03-14

While the Tao Te Ching can be quite abstract to someone new to The Way, Benjamin Hoff's book gives clear examples using, of all people, Pooh. The lovable bear turns out to be the perfect centerpiece of  Taoist thought and action.<br />Skeptical still? Read this book and find  yourself opened to the simplicity and natural beauty of all that is Tao.	2000-03-11

Tolkien has created a masterpiece of literature that, while being in the fantasy genre, encompasses so much more and stretches the boundries. Intrigue, mystery, action, adventure, drama. It's all here. So strap on your travelling cloak  and prepare to join Frodo, Sam and Gandalf for a race through Middle-earth  in an attempt to thwart the evil Sauron, destroy the One Ring, and return  peace to the land.<br />If you want to share a story and perhaps some pipeweed  with the hobbits, sing and run through the forests with the elves, delve  underneath mountains with the dwarves, and, of course, tag along with the  greatest wizard of them all, Gandalf, this is the world waiting for you  when you open the cover.<br />Walk through the green grass of the Shire, stare  up at a starry sky at Elrond's, climb over the Misty Mountains(don't forget  to bring a coat), ride down the River Anduin and visit the lady Galadriel  in Lothlorien.

I had read this version of the Tao Te Ching previously on the web before deciding to buy the book. The way the text flowed together made me decide to purchase this edition and I just recieved the book today and it's  gorgeous.<br />First off, it's large. About the size of a magazine and all the  pages are printed on smooth almost glossy type of paper.<br />Each verse (for  lack of a better word) gets it's own page accompanied by pictures depicting  various scenes of nature. A real compliment to the writing allowing you  visualize what's being read.<br />One of the neatest things is that the  original Chinese writing is also included on the page facing the English  text. Very nice touch.<br />All in all, if you're looking for a beautifully  rendered version of the Tao Te Ching and a great format that will look good  on the bookshelf for years to come, you can't go wrong with this one.	2000-03-06

This is the first edition of &quot;The Art of War&quot; I've read and I'm glad I made the decision to pick this one up. Cleary does a remarkable job in the introduction of explaining Sun Tzu's philosophy. The peak efficiency  of knowledge and strategy is to make conflict altogether unnecessary:  &quot;To overcome others' armies without fighting is the best of  skills.&quot;<br />Also, Cleary goes into detail of the Taoist aspect of the  text by using quotes and examples from other ancient writings including the  Tao Te Ching.<br />A rather nice touch to this edition is that following each  of Tzu's sentences or paragraphs (written in boldface to be indentified  easily) are the further explanations of various Chinese commentators from  Cao Cao in 155-200 C.E. to Ho Yanxi of the Sung Dynasty. These commentaries  help to easily show the finer points of each ideology.<br />Overall, a quality  work that I'd recommend to anyone interested in reading &quot;The Art of  War&quot;.	2000-03-04

Reading a lot of the reviews before actually diving into the book I thought I was going to be disappointed. I'm not. While this may not be the Sword of Truth novel many were looking for, I for one, still found it a  good read. I liked Fith and I enjoyed all the information on Anderith and  the culture there. I found myself caring for the Hakens and I was flipping  the pages anxiously waiting to see what would happen next to Fith and  Beata. A little more Zedd would've been nice, but there's always the next  book. Not to give it away but after learning more about the Chimes and how  they operate I didn't find the &quot;chicken monster&quot; section all that  hard to believe. Overall I liked the book a lot..	1999-05-16
