US	51995011	R3QSRA0UVAWV4U	0310243882	365961091	Deadlock	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A Gripping Read	James Scott Bell has done it again, providing yet another fast-paced, riveting read, this time setting the book in the halls of the Supreme Court and Congress.  Being a Marylander, I was wondering if Bell would be able to nail that &quot;inside the beltway&quot; feel of DC.  He did.  I learned more about the Supreme Court, and in an entertaining way, reading this novel than I've ever learned in school.  The main character, Millie, a liberal justice, is written with such care and sensitivity.  Though her views were diametrically opposed to my own when the novel opens, I found myself loving the woman anyway, due to the fact that Bell paints her as a human being with wonderful qualities. Deadlock takes the high road in character-development, refusing to demonize her entire character because of differing political views.  Bravo, Jim, for writing a novel regarding issues without a heavy hand.  The story speaks for itself.	2002-12-07

This one must have had super glue on the cover because I found it in my hands all day long!  Jacobsen's research in weaponry, espionage, the military and Islam is astounding.  Islam has always seemed so mysterious to me and I've known little about it other than turbans and beards and women taking small steps in their swathing garments.  Clay opened my eyes in many ways regarding this growing world religion.  So much is at stake in Interview With the Devil, you wonder how could Jacobsen possibly fit this together?  But he does, with well-developed characters and breathtaking suspense.	2002-12-07
US	51995011	R3PI7XNUXM6DEV	0310235561	678068721	The Prodigy	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A Paradigm Expander	What struck me about The Prodigy were the three difficult questions Gansky posed.  1)  Does God still work through &quot;healers?&quot; And I'm not talking Marcus Welby, MD. and 2) Would God use a non-believing little boy to heal?  The Prodigy displays our preconceived notions, our quick answers, and then asks-- 3) Well why ever not?  Fast paced and thrilling, yes, but The Prodigy doesn't deliver yet another plot filled with pat, easy theology.  For this reason, I give it five stars.  We need more books willing to ask hard questions and unwilling to give easy answers.	2001-06-26

This is a non-fiction book you have a hard time putting down!  I've always looked forward to heaven because I'll get to be with my Savior.  But to be honest, the traditional view of standing around singing all day (and I love to sing!) didn't really appeal to me straight away.  I always said, &quot;Well, I'm sure I'll feel differently about that once I get there.&quot;  In Light of Eternity uses scripture to show that heaven is more than praising God in song...it's praising Him with the continued work of our hands and hearts, it's fellowship with other citizens of the City Foursquare, it's community...all in the light of God's loving presence.  &quot;What a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see!&quot;  And how much more significant the choices we make here on earth become, knowing that nothing is wasted.  --Lisa Samson, author of The Church Ladies.	2001-04-11

I always thought I was a big distributor of grace.  But as I read this book, I've been realizing what a vast wonder grace really is and I am humbled and awed and infinitely more aware of the &quot;ungrace&quot; that I mete out every day.  If you're tired of being angry at the world...if you're tired of jumping through hoops because you think God is going to like you better...read this book.  And rest in God's grace.  --Lisa Samson, author of The Church Ladies	2001-04-11

Not usually a fan of the medical thriller genre, I have to admit, The Chairman kept me turning pages!  Kraus has a way of defining the medical parameters of the premise and developing that plot-line in a way that's descriptive but never dry.  He doesn't try to WOW you with an overabundance of medical jargon, instead, chooses to bow to the flow of good story-telling.  The diagnosis is clear...The Chairman is a winner!    --Lisa Samson, author of The Church Ladies.	2001-04-10

It may not be &quot;scholarly&quot; as one reviewer pointed out, but for me, the average Christian woman who is so glad to fall into bed in one piece at night, I don't want dry Biblical exposition!  Give me stories!  Give me laughter, give me tears.  Give me thought-provoking messages to ponder.  Give me grace.  If you are in need of grace without having to wade through commentaries and &quot;scholarly&quot; books that must be accompanied by eight feet tall glasses of water, Liz is your lady!  And if her lessons at the end are from her own heart, then be glad, for her heart is as compassionate, understanding and accepting as your down comforter.  Highly, highly recommended.

As the former director children's church at my church, I heartily recommend this book.

Athol Dickson's writing is a cut above that of most inspirational mystery novelists.  If his dynamic  premises aren't enough, his interesting characters follow a path of twists  and turns, leaving the reader with nails far shorter than when they turned  to page one!  This book, dealing with such difficult issues as abortion and  voodoo, is impeccably researched and it is evident that Mr. Dickson spent  time crafting his novel, putting his reader and not his pocketbook first.   In a day when writers continually throw new releases on the shelf, it's  refreshing to see this author honor his commitment to excellence and so  honor his high opinion of his readers.  The effort is well worth it in this  case.  This is what Christian fiction ought to be.	2000-01-16

This striking, well-written novel will keep you turning pages well after lights out!  Set in L.A., Final Witness deals with the Russian  mafia, a subject I'd never read about before.  Fascinating detail,  well-rounded characters and colorful description are obvious trademarks of  this author.  But it is his fabulous dialogue that elevates this fast paced  novel to a higher level of fiction writing.    Should most definitely be a  movie!  You won't be disappointed.	2000-01-16

And Saint Maybe is my favorite of all her works that I've read thus far.  I have to tell you, Saint Maybe is a book you'll never forget. And it is a book you count down  the pages with dread to the end.  But, it does end, and it leaves you with  that bitter-sweet taste in your mouth you neither welcome nor despise.  I  loved this book so much, and I loved her hero.  He's a hero you might pass  on the street without realizing it.  He's a man you might smile at in the  supermarket.  Anne Tyler creates characters in book after book, that, zany  though some of them may be ... goshdarnit, you just wish they could invite  you in for a cup of coffee!	1999-04-05

I liken &quot;The Rapture of Canaan&quot; to a ho-hum, hackneyed forest with some GREAT trees.  I couldn't buy Ninah's ability to fool herself, or her  incredible naivete after being sexually awakened and already pregnant.   Other than the four or five central characters, all the supporting  characters might have been the same person. I hardly cared about anyone.    Yet the author's use of the English language is brilliant.  I would have  put the book down but for the actual writing.  As I said, some great trees  in so-so forest.      And is it just me, or are these Oprah Book club  selections a guarantee you'll be depressed at least 75% of the time reading  about the diseased, the dysfunctional, the disfigured and the dying?   Lighten up, girlfriend ... at least once in a while!	1999-04-05
