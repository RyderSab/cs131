I found this book to be a great source of material on the stages of pain that you go through with a divorce.  This book takes you through the building blocks of what it will take for you to go through, and ultimately rebuilt from.  Some of the topics covered are denial, fear, adaptation, friendship, loneliness, self-worth, transition,love, trust, and future relationships.<br /><br />I found myself clearly identifying with many of the stages that others go through in a divorce.  It was refreshing to hear what you feel is normal and others feel that way too.  Fisher and Alberti definately speak with insight, and understanding on this topic.  This book was part of the reading along with the a divorce recovery class I took, this book was an important reasource in the class.  It is definately worth picking up or checking out at your local library.	2005-10-05

Having first watched many of the episodes over the years, reading this book, and then rewatching episodes mentioned in this book, I have to agree many Christian values are found within the Simpsons.  Pinsky does a great job of assembling many of the aspects of the every day life of the Simpsons.  Like many families they go to church, sometimes unwillingly, pray, yes, for some oddball requests, and go through issues of their own faith.<br /><br />Like many of us they do struggle.  According to Pinsky from a statisical perspective 25% of the episodes are based upon faith, holidays, and religion.  What other show in the mainstream does that?  The book is worth reading because it demonstrates the Simpsons do seek a spititually filled life.  No character is fully mocked because of their spritual beliefs, even the annoying Ned Flanders is portrayed well at the end of the day.<br /><br />This would be a great book for a younger audience.  It does not portray deep spiritual questions, but it does demonstrate a clear and purposeful relationship the Simpson's have with God.  This book would be a good read and perhaps a biblical study.  Since the Simpsons are nondemoninational the story lines should not conflict specific beliefs.  One thing is clear from reading this book the writers of the show intentionally created their show demonstrating characters who seek out God, worship, and pray.  An eye opening read!	2005-10-03

You might ask yourself, I have heard this word boundary, but I do not know what it means.  Boundaries are often mentioned in terms of relationships.  Boundaries are a simple concept, but they can vary from person to person.  Boundaries essentially keep the good stuff on the inside and the bad stuff on the outside.  In the book Making Dating Work Boundaries in Dating, Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend discuss boundaries at length.<br /><br />Now, I just mentioned that everyone has boundaries whether they realize them or not, and they are meant to keep the good stuff on the inside, and the bad stuff on the outside.  Now boundaries can keep the good people close to you, and the people that will hurt you away.  Think of boundaries as an invisible property line around yourself, and that those boundaries should keep the good things in, and protect you from things you do not want in.<br /><br />Examples of violations of your person boundaries include: the loss of freedom of oneself, being with the wrong person, control issues, the inability to say no, doing too much within the relationship at the expense of yourself.  Boundaries are your beliefs and ideals that make you especially unique.  Infringing upon your boundaries only serves to make you an unhappy person.<br /><br />How do you know what your personal boundaries are?  You need to know yourself.  Shakespeare said \\"To thine own self be true.\\"  You do need to know what is important to you.  What qualities do you like in yourself, and want from others.  For example if you value honestly, being with someone that is not honest will not make you happy in the long term.  You will need to be strong enough in your personal character to eliminate people who do not exhibit honestly in their words and in their actions.<br /><br />Now looking at just you being honest with yourself requires some homework on your part to acknowledge what is important to you, for you to be willing to uphold your ideas, and then you must communicate your ideals to others.  You need to communicate your expectations about a relationship clearly.  When that other person may violate your expectations you need to be willing to discuss these ideas head on, and if need be you need to be willing to set that relationship free.<br /><br />Boundaries are really meant to protect you.  They are meant to keep you happy, and safe in relationships, whether these are friendships or relationships that may go further.  You do have some ownership in knowing what things are important to you, they may be honestly, personal character, not using drugs and or alcohol.  Once you know where your standards are you can communicate these to others and position yourself around people that will not violate your personal boundaries.<br /><br />In addition to this book, I also recomment their other book Boundaries, and the workbook to go along with the text.  Their topics are so insightful and do a marvelous job of explaining what boundaries are, how to set them, and how to tell others where are boundaries lie.t communicate your ideals to others.

The title caught my attention, and after glancing at this book I picked it up.  Southern women have always been known for their hospitality and their way to get things done in life.  Working with a lovely southern coworker who could literally sell ice to the devil I picked up this book.<br /><br />What I liked about this book is that flirting isn't just romantic, but she also categorizes as social.  You may flirt with someone socially, but not have an intimate relationship with them.  You might also think of this book as how to schmooze.  She is careful to demonstrate ways of being extra polite, and lightening someone's day.  Flirting, in her terms is playful, fun, and both parties enjoy the exchange.<br /><br />She discusses how she has gotten out of tickets, exchanged phone numbers, and has thanked people in variety of ways, with both people walking away feeling very happy. So, this book covers more than flirting with a romanitc partner, but also how to get along wonderfully with everyone you meet in life, and who of us couldn't use a little more of that?	2005-07-12

This book is well worth the read.  While much of the information is placed in analogies, with all stories pertaining to fishing, the book does have some good information in it.  I like how the book has you focus on, *YOU* first.  I have found that this book can help you size up a potential dating partner.  I like how the book suggests to move slow, and take your time, and if you don't like what you have throw it back!!<br />Lots of good information in there, definately worth a good read in finding men to date.  I think other books would be more appropirate for longer term relationships.<br />The book gives advice through examples that are easy to understand.  Steve Nakamoto, definately gives wonderful advice on where to attract the man you want, you can, and should be choosy.  This is well worth the read, and is even a good book to refer back to for later.	2005-07-10

The workbook has the potential to be a guide to help you learn about yourself, and what you will need from a relationship.<br />If you are a fan of these authors, I would highly recomment this workbook.

This book is written is a no-nonsense style.  Sandra Brown is factual, and plain spoken when it comes to dealing with dangerous men.  Dangerous men look just like normal men, but they will only drag you emotionally and mentally downward.  She describes plainly the different types of abuse, and how they make you feel.  She also discusses what can be a chronic problem like depression, compared to a psychopath, who will prey upon you.<br /><br />I like that she goes through your personal red flags, we all have them, but we often fail to recognize them.  We fail to recognize red flags due to the way we were brought up.  Often we have been taught how to be dsyfunctional in order to keep peace within the family unit.<br /><br />Sandra Brown does an excellent job of describing what red flag are, how to recognize yours, and how to learn not to ignore them.  She then guides you through recogizing what works for you personally, and what does not.  She teaches about boundaries, and how you can develop some of your own.<br /><br />This book is plainly written, and may seem a little harsh at times.

If you are not familiar with the series, it really works well for nonsecular purposes as well.  Information about boundaries is brought forth in a very sensible and non emotional way.  The approach is more thoughtful than most nonsecular texts as the spiritual side of our souls is brought into play.<br /><br />What I find most remarkable about this book as that it works so well with the book and the series if you are taking it as a study.  The workbook can be used alone without the group study, and asks more probing questions when it comes to defining your own personal boundaries.  This book goes futher than the book does in asking you what lies behind your boundary issues.<br /><br />I can't give enough high praise of this book and the questions that it asks.  This is meant to be used along with the book Boundaries, and I would highly recommend purchasing them together.	2005-06-15

I like this book from the perspective that before you get invested with the guy watch how the treats you. Now once again, do not get invested with a guy until you see how he treats you. This book suggests you deserve someone that will treat you the way you want to be treated. Do not settle for less.<br /><br />It is a little cold hearted, but I think for the most part this book might save you some anguish. This book almost employs the tough love approach. You can not work from the perspective that you can make someone into the person that you want them to be, but if they do not match your standards move on, immediately.<br /><br />Once again this book isn't about forming deep and meaningful relationships, but should really be a way to cull through the men in your life, and finding your keepers. Its a quick read, but worthwhile. A good book on relationships and those dynamics is Make Up, Don't Break Up by Dr. Bonnie Eaker Weil.	2005-04-22

Susan writes with empathy towards these situations.  As not all relationships start out badly, nor do they always start out with a bunch of lies.  Its after you are settled in the relationship, the realization hits.<br /><br />Many different women, and their relationships are described in this book.  Along with these relationship descriptions are the results of the decisions that they took.  Not all relationships were doomed.<br /><br />One good piece of advice I recently read, is if in a relationship you are lied to once, its a misunderstanding, the second time, its a moment of huge reflection; upon the third lie, leave before you are too involved.  Susan empowers the reader with ideas, suggestions, and some of the reasons why your lover may be the way they are.<br /><br />Its definately one of the best books I have read on relationships, and why people do what they do.  I would urge anyone to read this book that may have a relationship with a compulsive liar.  Not to do anything about the situation only results in more and greater unhappiness.	2005-04-21

Why does the person you love continually put you down, lie, treat you badly, or even takes to acts of physical aggression?  Susan Forward does an excellent job of describing these types of relationships.  Just because you are with a person who may act like this, doesn't mean that there is something wrong with you.<br /><br />Those who treat partners in intimate relationships badly are often the most seductive, persuasive, and romantic persons you will ever find.  It is a shame that they do not stay just like you found them.  These are individuals who must act out against you to feel better about themselves.<br /><br />She explains this type of person very well, she treats the victims role with compassion.  I found that this book brought clarity to a relationship that I had with one of these type of people.  When I met this person, I thought they were God's gift, and they walked on water; by the end of the relationship the lies, the verbal and emotional assaults out weighed any positive quality the relationship ever had.<br /><br />If you, or someone you love is in a similar type of relationship, I would urge you to read this book.  It is fantastic.  Susan Forward explains these types relationships so well, but better yet, she empowers the reader to take steps in regaining their own self back.	2005-04-21

I think this book is best read after one of the Patricia Evans books.  Patricia Evan's Verbally Abusive Relationships does a slightly better job of explaining exactly what verbal abuse is, but this book goes behind why the other person does this.  Lundy does a fantastic job of explaining why in the world someone wants to abuse the person they are involved with.<br /><br />Now, honestly, this book is written towards the female assuming the male is the abusive partner.  The book explains why women are left in the lurch, and confused by a man's actions when they are emotionally/verbally abusive.  Lundy is also very honest about the chances of that man changing and how you may be able to tell he is changing.  He is also frank that most men do not change.<br /><br />This book will completely validate the victim's feelings and let them know what their cycle of thoughts is, and the book will help you feel validated.  One of the harder aspects of being in a relationship of someone that is an verbal abuser, is that the other person tries to redefine your reality.  Lundy does a terrific job of explaining what the victim's thought process might be.<br /><br />He takes a very analytical view of the abuser, abuse cycle, and the mentality of the persons involved with the abuser.  He gives the sides of all parties involved.  He also gives the victim a good idea of how to respond, and what to expect.  Honestly knowing what is going on, and being aware of the situation can be enough to help a victim to get through the situation.<br /><br />I liked the throroughness of the book, and what he felt were the positions of all parties involved.  He goes into debt on the mindset of all parties, and helps to explain why each person does what they do in that situation.  This book can be very validating for the victim, and gives them idea of what to expect in the future.  This is a must read if you are interested in the subject of verbal abuse.verbal abuse. <br />	2005-03-23

This book is even good for a casual read as well.  For me this book was purchased for a personal relationship.  Ever wondered what was wrong in a relationship, but couldn't quite but your finger on it, but you were told it was your fault?  This is the book for you!<br /><br />While verbal abuse isn't as visual as physical abuse, verbal abuse typically comes before physical abuse.  Verbal abuse can look like a normal conversation that leaves you confused about what just happened, or why something so simple got a huge negative reaction.<br /><br />Verbal abuse typically happens one on one, so others are not there to notice.  My ex partner was cunning, and wonderful when others were around.  In private, the scene was often very different.  I was told when I wanted to talk about our relationship that I was always trying to create a fight, didn't know what I was talking about, or situation X didn't happen like that, that he loved me, or that he would never do anything to really hurt me.<br /><br />As with many other forms of verbal abuse, there are ups and downs.  The relationship isn't entirely bad, but it does leave you drained, saddened, and confused.  This book helps cut through a lot of the crazy making that can happen in a relationship.  Its a good read to see the situation for what it really is.<br /><br />I also thought this book was good, because we often learn unhealthy speech patterns when dealing with others.

This is a great book if you are wanting to learn the science behind baking.  Perhaps your a fan of Alton Brown's show, Good Eats, perhaps your looking for great recipes.  This book is written in a very easy style to read.  Alton Brown gives the what's and the how's behind baking.  This kind of information is great for the novice or the experienced cook.<br /><br />Personally, I found th pancake recipe was worth the purchase price alone.

This book, while not written by pyschologists does have some worthwhile material in it.  The book is unique because it also has referrences to same sex relationships.  The book incorporates many aspects of a breakup and the aftermath.<br /><br />The book starts with ground zero, the actual breakup itself.  Whether you initiated the breakup or not, its still painful.  Theu do suggest that it is going to take some time to get over the shock and the initial pain.  Then the book has your focus turned on you; how to take good care of yourself.  The book then moves onto rebuilding your life, your home, and your new social circle.  The book then deals with settling in and accepting the breakup and offers some suggestions on moving on.<br /><br />I liked the book simply because it offers a range of advice.  No silly picture, no fake conversations, no fancy pictures.  This book gives you the meat and potatoes of trying to navigate your way through your breakup.	2005-03-11

It is fairly easy to see where someone falls in terms of being a distancer and a pursuer.  From knowing this, determines how you should better communicate with your partner.  Now while this book does not suggest dramatic change over night, it does suggest making small changes that can make large results.<br /><br />I also like that she doesn't set the reader up to expect dramatic changes from the other person.  She suggests in how to better communicate with the other person, whether it is your partner, parent, or child.  Then she also teaches you to set some boundaries, and make sure you take good care of yourself first.<br /><br />I like this realistic approach to relationships.  The knowledge in this book can apply to many different types of relationships, do you don't have to have a significant other to benefit from this book.  Its well worth the read.	2005-03-08

I like this book from the perspective that before you get invested with the guy watch how the treats you.  Now once again, do not get invested with a guy until you see how he treats you. This book suggests you deserve someone that will treat you the way you want to be treated.  Do not settle for less.<br /><br />It is a little cold hearted, but I think for the most part this book might save you some anguish. This book almost employs the tough love approach.  You can not work from the perspective that you can make someone into the person that you want them to be, but if they do not match your standards move on, immediately.<br /><br />Once again this book isn't about forming deep and meaningful relationships, but should really be a way to cull through the men in your life, and finding your keepers.  Its a quick read, but worthwhile.  A good book on relationships and those dynamics is Make Up, Don't Break Up by Dr. Bonnie Eaker Weil.	2005-03-06

In college was a chemistry minor, and thought it was very exciting.  It explans the many whys and hows behind basic everyday chemistry.  Is this book super technical, no.  Does it have enough science in it to make it credible, definately.<br /><br />Some of the topics that are included are:<br /><br />Why are Opals and Pearls Iridescent?<br /><br />Why are Ice Cubes Cloudy on the Inside?<br /><br />What Makes a No-Tears Champoo?<br /><br />How do Sutures Dissolve?<br /><br />Why do Lightsticks glow?<br /><br />Are Flamingos Naturally Pink?<br /><br />There are almost 100 of these types of questions.  This book might make a great reference for a teacher, or a student in a science fair.  The book covers some basic chemistry, and does a great job in building up some excitement around a subject that some may think is dull.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book because it is broken up into sections: gases, solutions, solids, thermodynamics, and then into the questions that apply to those subjects.  The book is a fairly easy read, and thankfully isn't too techincal for those of us who may not be so fresh on some of our chemical understanding.	2005-02-20

I liked that Rick Steve's would also add a little bit of the culture and things you should note in here.  In the restaurant guide he gives you suggestions, and the fact that your going to pay a bread charge when you sit down at a restaurant.  While this book is not complete with all of the words you may need.  This coupled with patient folks, you will get what you need.<br /><br />I think this book is a good starting point, and certainly helped me out as a tourist.  I was able to order in a restaurant, get subway directions, receive assistance in a shop without too much trouble.  This was one of my best investments on my trip.	2004-11-09

This cookbook is packed with delicious recipes, some of my favorites have been the Garlic Bread, Homemade Hummus, Pulled Pork with Jack and Coke BBQ Sauce.  Honestly this book really combines the best elements of a hometown cookbook with stories, anecdotes, and pictures of the New York Firefighters along with some of the recipes that have gone over very well with the men who so often fight for our lives.<br />I love how this book is laid out, distinct sections on appetizers, side dishes, main dishes, each recipe has its own page, so they are easy to read.  The recipes are easy to follow, and don't leave you trying to interpret difficult instructions.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone trying to broaden out their cooking repitoire, or if you have a special place in your heart for the New York Firefighters.	2003-12-30

She writes with a conversational style describing her very different family, growing up with many syblings, and several mothers.<br />What comes through this book that while polygamy may have an appeal for some, it really comes packed with many loaded issues.  Multiple wives creates multiple issues.  Logistically speaking it is difficult to support seven wives, and many children.  While her father was a doctor, several of the wives worked out of the home to help support the family, and those that were not working out of the home worked constantly trying to keep up with laundry, cooking, and cleaning.<br />Her life was wrought with hiding their family secret, as it is still illegal to have so many wives.  Only children of the first wife are legally recognized as being legitimate.  Their lives were not easy, and growing up in the church left them often with marrying early to continue this cycle.<br />This book is definatly worth a read!  Its definately not the simple tale you think it might be.	2003-12-30

I have found this book to be very enlightening, and certainly changed my view on the fast food industry.  The light that Scholosser paints is not favorable, its dark, and seedy.  Many of us went through the rite of passage working in this industry at one point or another.  My personal experience wasn't pleasant, but I thought it was just me.<br />The masterminds behind large fast food companies, keep low wages in place in the guise that they will have to raise prices if they don't.  They lobby and try to influence legislation to keep the minimum wage down.  They purposefully force farmers and ranchers into cutting their profits to take their bids.  Meat packing plants that package for these companies, are also under huge cost pressures, and aren't always known for the safest work places.<br />I found his take on marketing to children certainly influces food choices of individuals for life, so best to start them off young at going to fast food to be a very skilled plan to keep business coming.<br />While his viewpoints may be a bit extreme, it is an industry that keeps wages down.  These workers get few benefits, all in the name of profits.  The book does paint a dark picture of the industry, but it also notes a few chains that aren't so harsh, and that do take good care of its workers.  Whatever your opinion of this book is, after reading it you won't look the same way at fast food again.	2003-11-17

Granted much of the information contained in this book is not useful in everyday life, as the progression of tableware is much beyond what we normally use, the extra tidbits of information is very enlightening.  I like this book because it explains everything you could possibly encounter.  I found that the pictures of silverware, and tableware to be very helpful.<br />Drachenfels writes with a great style that makes the reading effortless.  She writes a thorough history of tableware, and manners how they have developed through the ages.  Sometimes the reasoning behind a specific manner can be very intriguing.  While the book calls itself a complete guide to table setting, manners, and tableware, I feel its main focus is on the tableware and table setting.  This is not the complete guide to manners.<br />The book is a fascinating read if you are interesting in dinning, and is very helpful for setting a table, and selection of tableware.  The book is well written, easy to read, and has many illustrations for examples of what is being discussed.  The Art of the Table is also very interesting from a historical perspective and how dinning has evolved in the West over the years.	2003-11-15

He writes with a heart felt style when discussing the emotions that cats have.  He has written many books about animals, and seems to have great insight as to what goes on inside their brains and hearts.<br />You can quickly tell he is an avid cat lover, as he has many cats himself.  Through years of observations of animals and through his own experiences he sums cats emotions into nine categories:  narcissism, love, contentment, attachment, jealousy, fear, anger, curiosity, and playfulness.  These nine emotions seem to work well in explaining why cats are they way they are.<br />The book does not offer a bunch of scientific explanation behind his theories, but offers his hypothesis from his personal experience. A cat lover will enjoy his tales and stories, as some are quite entertaining.  After reading this book you will certainly look at your cat through different eyes.	2003-11-15

I have found his reviews on restaurants that I am familiar with to be right on target.  The book is more heavily weighted for the &quot;loopies&quot; and the southwest side of town, but does have selections from all areas.<br />What makes this book very worthwhile are accurate descriptions of the restaurants, items that each place specializes in, and their price range.  I also loved the section of more expensive and better known restaurants to go to during lunch hours.  Each restaurant is profiled with type of food, price range, speciality items, decor, and much more.<br />If you are looking for a great jumpstart to your dining adventures and you do not want to spend a great deal, this book is the way to go.

This book is perfect for reviewing for the GMAT, it is filled with many questions like you will see on the real GMAT exam.

This book is a well written book featuring some of the common delights of French Cuisine.  What impresses me most is that most recipes have suggestions for dishes that will go with the recipe, or how to use the leftovers if you should have any.<br />The book is well illustrated with photographs of some of the dishes.  Directions are clear and concise with very little room for confusion.  The recipes are very tasty, and fairly easy to prepare for most cooks.<br />Selections in this book vary from simple to more complex.  My personal favorite out of this book is the Potatoes Au Gratin, a recipe that I have been asked for more than once.  The Brie soup is delightful, and perfect on a cool weather day.  The book also features desserts, meats, and so much more.<br />If you enjoy their restaurant, or even if you have an interest in French cooking, this book may be ideal for you.

Honestly for me, this book was the best.  The Princeston Review is a little too easy, and not quite as though as it should be.  The Barron's is a little too difficult and does not seem to focus on what is really at hand.<br />Kaplan book is written in an almost conversational style that will help guide and direct you in the areas that you need to study in.  A thorough pretest is given, so you can know where you fall behind.  From here you can then practice on the areas that you need.<br />The book gives specific review information in for Reading comprehension, Math Review, Critical Reasoning, and Data Sufficency.  The book gives tips, tricks, and ideas for mastering these questions that are easy to remember.  The book also gives you some small lists that you should flat out memorize.<br />This book comes with the best CD.  The CD alone is well worth the price of the book.  The CD comes with a pretest, and once you take the pretest, it comes out with several plans for you: long time to study, cram mode.  The CD is interactive with video, games, and much more.  Definately worthwhile on this basis alone.<br />Out of all of the prep guides, this is the one you should pick up, best written book, and with the adaptive computer tests, and study guides on the CD you can't go wrong with this test.	2003-08-03

You may want to get this book in addition to the other one.  With that being said, I feel this book is still quite good.<br />This book has a theory that the GMAT score, and score takers can be broken down into three buckets, low, medium, and high.  Therefore specific preparation is broken down into three buckets.<br />This book starts out as a basic guideline of what is tested, some theory behind the test, and some basic things you may need to review you upon.  Each type of question is examined, and has many practice examples.  Next, you will get a pretest, and it will show you in which bucket of questions you may fall into.<br />The english and the math are then broken down into sections that have easy, medium, and then the most difficult questions.  This way you concentrate in the level where you have the most success.  Since the breakdown is done this way, if your on the high end of the scoring range, this book may not be the best match for you.  Otherwise this book might be exactly what you are looking for.<br />I really liked that there was specific coaching done on each type of questions, the pretest, and then the brakedown of questions into easy, medium, and hard. This way you could study and see the progression of how well you are/were doing.	2003-07-16

Then the book gives you a pretest to let you know where you stand, and then it begins to give you some review sections.<br />The review sections are pretty good, but they are not helpful if you are someone that needs to brush up on a subject.  In fact, they do tell you they are no substitute to real knowledge.  So you might want to keep that in mind.<br />The next sections of the book are a series of practice tests that are good exercises to go through, but some people claim some of the answers are wrong, and I did find a few typos in the book.  So it is a little frustrating to work through.<br />The computer software disk, is worthless.  Other books such as the Princeston review's disk has LOTS of questions.  This book computerized the first exam in the book only.  Not exactly helpful, not adaptive, so don't look for a lot of help.<br />Now this book might be good if you just want to sit down and do problems similar to the ones on the exam.  If you are looking for a reach coach, or anything that is adaptive, this book isn't much help.  Personally, I wouldn't purchase the book, but if someone had a copy laying around, I'd pick it up.	2003-07-16

Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun	Books	5	10	11	N	N	She is the Martha Stewart for Everyday People	This is my first book of hers, and I love it.  I saw her a few times on the Food TV network and fell in love with her homey, down-to-earth style of cooking and entertaining.  She has easy ideas and her food is delicious.  I like her comments in her margarita recipe, not to use the expensive kind, but use the inexpensive type of tequila.  She is my kind of lady with comments like this.<br />Her book is well illustrated with pictures of the recipes that are in this book.  What I really enjoy is that the recipes are quality recipes that turn out very well.  Some of my favorites that I have tried from this book are the apple crostata, which is a rustic apple pie that tastes devine. California pizzas, so much better than take out with fresh mozzarella, basil, and fresh tomatoes.  Her chocolate chunk cookies will have everyone asking you for more.<br />I can't say enough nice things about this book, but I like what lies behind this book.  Good food doesn't make the party, its the good company.  You should spend your time and efforts with those that you love, and not be so exhausting when you entertain you can't enjoy yourself either.  All of her recipes really fit this theory as they are pretty easy to put together, but taste like they came from a fancy restaruant.	2003-06-08

Thanfully they have given up the way to make recipes be counterparts of their high fat, high calorie cousins.  This book will have you running to the store for a few ingredients for some of their recipes.  They will be tasty.  Honestly I loved this book as there are many good recipes that are much lower in points than 8.  For those who have family that is not on the program, I think you will still be satisfied as the food is actually good.  Their instructions are easy to follow, and while you may need to go to the store to pick up an ingredient or two, it works well.  If you like a little variety, and don't mind using a special ingredient on occasion this book will work well for you.	2003-04-13

The book covers specific topics such as the Barbarians and their forcing of the Roman Empire to fall, Saints and Sinners with a primary focus on Thomas Becket, Emperors and Kings with highlights on Charlemagne, William the Conqueror, King John, and Louis VI and Lous IX. Also covered are the Crusades, and the Jewish influence in Europe.  While the book is easy to read as Leone's style lends its self to a quick read, I find some of the research lacking.  A few of the resources come from less and full acedemic peer reviewed articles.  I think for general reading, and some research projects this book will be very suitable.  It is an interesting read, and well worth picking up if you enjoy the middle ages.	2003-04-13

This isn't in the style of Susy Orman, but the book does offer common sense advice to the individual investor.  He demonstrates that you are the responsible for your destiny, and some extra steps you can take in investing.  For example, do your homework when it comes to brokerages, how is your broker being paid.  A broker's best interest, it not your best interest.<br />He takes a commonsense approach to uncracking the code of balance sheets, income sheets and much more for the common investor.  A quick look will often lead you in the right direction.  You don't need to have a business degree for implimenting any of his suggestions.<br />Levitt's style of writting makes for an easy, unemcumbered read.  He speaks in layman's terms so if not a business person, this will make sense to you.  I recommend this book to all that might want to brush up on common corporate practices.	2003-04-11

I have to give it four stars at it really only includes anglo western women.  This gives little detail for women of the East, Africian nations, or even indiginous people of the Americas.  With that being said the book is highly informative and goes through marriage through times.  Attention is given to the Greek, Roman, Western European wives, then off to America and how American women's lives have changed.<br />This book explores what typically was an arranged marriage for family prestige and gain, until it became a love match.  Wives roles were more than simply taking care of the house and children through out time.  Wives often ran a husbands business, and was even a requirement for some careers.<br />While this book may have been written from a feminist point of view, I believe this book can be read by all who want to know about the role of a wife from a historical standpoint.  Its a wonderful thought provoking read that will leave you thankful you live in the modern age.	2003-03-22

This book is not my favorite. Its soo large. It goes off into brands I have never heard or seen anything of. I think that since has introduced her own line of cosemetics the information can be biased. I like her ideas and recommendations, they aren't always for the most expensive products, and I do like that she documents studies and puts scientific information behind what she says.<br />The book is largest yet, and a little unwheely. I think since there are soo many brands now it makes things confusing. I do like all of the notes about each product<br />I'll admit I have saved a ton of money with her books. I have been gulliable by infomercials, and home shopping networks. With this book I am able to put the breaks on and evaluate wisely. She offers sound advice, and its worth a look.	2003-03-08

There is an excellent exploration of many different countries with 2 to 3 pages devoted for many of them.  There is a brief recipe section in the back that has clear and concise recipes to follow.  I really like this book because you can read it in small segments and you don't feel the need to sit down and read the whole book at once.  The book is fasniating you will learn a great deal about different cultures and food that you may not be familiar with.  This is a great book to thumb through for information and ideas.	2003-02-24

The book goes on to describe cuts of vegetables and their special names for them.  Once we have established the basics she goes onto menus and a good deal of recipes to fill out these menus.  Her recipes are clear, concise, and filled with pictures, so you will not doubt that you are preparing these dishes properly.  Honestly, this has to be the best book I have seen in clarifing a style of food that I was not familiar with.  This book deserves more than 5 stars.

This book contains many of the works of both Artemesia and her father. The book is geared more towards Artmesia as she is the lesser known.

The book discusses paints, paint quality, demystifies the selection of paper, and spends a good deal of time on technique.  The book also has tons of exercises to help you better your skill.

Its 450 or so pages of text will seem to breeze by.  This book is clearly about salt, make no mistake about it.  The author start out by giving you a brief tale of his personal fascination with salt.  He clearly examines all cultures throughout time in terms of their relationship with salt.  Salt certainly was a finding that enabled man to go further in their journies, and have something to trade that practically all societies needed.<br />I especially liked this book because it backed up its theories with facts and not just idle speculation.  The book is well documented, and sprinkled with just the right amount of illustrations and pictures to make the chapter fill out properly.  This book is definately written by someone that has a passionate interest in something we normally do not think twice about.  After reading this book I can not look at a salt shaker in the same light anymore.  If you love history, and want to take a journey through it via a different path, this is the ideal book for you.	2003-01-07

Easy to read recipes, clear and concise directions, and lovely pictures to view.  I am amazed at the variety of ingredients that he uses in his dishes.  Its not that they are typically hard to find or anything, I simply didn't realize the variety of food in Italian cooking.  Now if you are simply looking for pasta and sauces this isn't the book for you.  This book does cover pasta, some delightful desserts, but there is a large variety in meats that this book uses.

I found the book filled with information regarding cultural beliefs to be very unbiased, and clear and concise.  I did find the style a bit dry, and at times found myself pushing to go forward.<br />He used many different examples of every day life to exemplify many different beliefs and customs.  I feel the book is well researched, and very nonbiased.  I feel since it was published originally in the early 1970s, and then updated in 1983 to be a bit dated for current use.  It is twenty years out of date.  Granted a culture would not change so greatly in the last twenty years, but I feel the book should be updated.  For me it is difficult to validate points with social situations that are  thirty years out of date, when current information is so readily available.  Once again, a very informative book, well researched, but I personally found his writting style a bit dry, and at times felt frustrated that referrences were at times thirty to thirty five years out of date.  A good read to start a research project, or to simply gather basic information regarding culture.	2002-12-15

As she states in the book this story starts out rather baudy and morphs as our morality changes through time.  Little Red Riding Hood becomes younger and younger through the years with first starting out as a young woman undressing and crawling into bed with the wolf, until now where the woman singlehandedly defeats the wolf herself.<br />I like this book because she brings in historical context of this tale.  It is amazing how many tales may have originated from the French Court during its heyday.  Cinderella, which also started out much differently, Rapunzell, are all noted in this book.  I hope the author continues writing about other tales as she did this one.  Her style makes it hard to put this one down.	2002-12-12

I don't think growing up female you can escape being touched by this in the slightest bit.  This book almost compliments The Ophelia Complex, which would be what would happen in the more extreme cases.<br />While the book does not offer any conclusions of what can be done, like others, I agree just talking about what goes on is of a great help.  Validation is often the start of a healing process.  The descriptions of some of the experiences are heart wrenching, and sometimes vaguely familiar to my own experiences growing up.<br />I wish I could say that this book offers some suggestions on how to handle certain situations, but I think its purpose is to make you aware of the masterful passive aggression that so often happens in manipulating relationships at a young age.  Its interesting that our society brings this out in those that are so young.<br />I would recommend this book if your female, have a daughter, wife, or any woman in your life.  I can't imagine being of the female gender and totally missing this almost seemingly a rite of passage.	2002-11-28

She writes in a style that reminds me of Julia Child in her thoroughness.  She will give you a tip or two about most recipes, or tell you where they come from.  The fare in this book isn't what you would find in the grocery store, but rather these are the wonderful little cakes you might get from an old fashioned bakery.  Her instructions are clear, concise, and will not leave you wondering if you are doing this correctly.  I would highly recommend any of her books for enlarging your dessert offerings.  She will have your guests wondering how you were able to make these delicious desserts.	2002-11-14

This book is filled with those delightful cakes, pastries, and cookies of yesteryear, you know, when bakeries actually cooked everything from scratch.  Your not going to find things you would find in your local grocery store in here,  you will find treats that you would normally find only in the finest bakeries.<br />The book is divided into several sections: Muffins, Danishes, crusty breads, pastries, cookies, pies and tarts, cakes, and chiffon layer cakes.  Most recipes come with either a hand drawing or there are a few color pictures included.  Each recipe is carefully written and includes information about the type of pastry this is, or something special you need to know about the preparation.  The Queen of Sheba Torte is my favorite in this book a rich chocolate cake with a ganache topping.  You will find that this book will help you create finery that typically only comes out of the better bakeries.	2002-11-14

These aren't the recipes that are so-so, they are all wonderful.  This book covers many different types of desserts.  She focuses primarly upon; cakes, pies and tarts, yeast cakes, sweet breads, gingerbreads, muffins, cookies, crackers, custards, mousses, souffles, fruit desserts, ice cream, and other frozen desserts.  The first 25 page of this book will help you with ideas and suggestions on ingredients, equipment, and techniques.  Recipes are clearly written, with either where the recipe comes from, or an important tip that you might need to aide you in making the particular recipe.  To me, this book reminds me of Julia Child's French Mastering the Art of French Cooking books.  If you are looking to make something beyond the local bake sale, this book is perfect for you.	2002-11-14

While it is not one if you are looking for a great quanity of recipes, it does have many different recipes in it.  The recipes seem to shoot for the folks that like a little gourmet flavor to their recipes. They have a wonderful asparagus salad with blue cheese, pasta with white clam sauce, and all sorts of delicious pizzas.  Recipes include nutritional value, this book is not particularly friend to Weight Watchers because they offer no fiber counts.  All in all I bet that many can find several good recipes out of this book.	2002-11-08

While I am not a culinary student, I do love to cook and learn the science behind the food.  This book is the most comprehensive, best photographed book I have seen.  This is written for the student, or professional preparation in terms of quantities the recipes make.  You can easily scale most of them to suit your personal needs.  The book is divided into various sections there is a textbook feel as each area of food is explained thoroughly, then come the recipes.  This book is nice as it offers many suggestions and ideas with each recipe.  While this may not be the best choice for every cook at home, I think this is a good choice for people that want a little more out a cookbook.	2002-11-08

Tips and ideas are given on how to reduce stress and how to help change or tailor your job in a direction that you have the most power.

The other page is the one where you get to note how much water you drank, the fruits and veggies you ate.  You also get to enter in some info about exercise that you did and more.  Some of us can do things better if we put them down on paper.  If this is your style, this is a great book for you.	2002-11-08

I for one, grew up with my Mom's edition and have come to think of it is my personal standard.  This book is much different in books of the last few years.  They tend to swap out a few recipes each time.  This updated version has more recipes, and is thicker than they have been in the past.  They do their best to offer you recipes that are easy to prepare and have a wide range.  There are vegetarian recipes, ethnic recipes, and much more.  This edition offers you a new section on crockpot cooking.<br />The sturdy ring binder will last for years in your home.  It is coated with plastic so it will clean up just fine.  The recipes come complete with nutritional value, and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.  It has some pictures of recipes, and it will also show you how to do a particular techinique.

I discovered this book through a business communications class and have found the theories discussed to be very insightful.  This is one of the better books on this subject that I have found.  The broader theory of personality typing according to Meyers-Briggs is discussed in full detail, and there are large sections on each personality type.  She brings in every day examples pinning a particular comedian to a personality type.  She does give many Star Trek examples as well.  I choose this book over others because of the depth she goes into the general as well as the individual personality types.<br />Why was this useful in everyday life?  Knowing a bit about this helps me realize how I come across, and how to communicate effectively with others.  You approach introverts in a different way than an extovert. Some people want big picture details, and others was fine details in everything.  You can save yourself a lot of time in dealing with people if you understand them.  Myers-Briggs isn't about helping people with their issues, but it is a way of knowing how they relate to others and the world.  Its wonderful to sum up a situation by understanding where all parties involved stand.  This is a great book for this, and her writting style is very easy on the non scientific mind and the casual reader.	2002-11-06

Not that I am a bitter person :) but this book is so refreshing to read when a relationship has gone badly. Everyone can relate to a relationship that has ended. This book is so enlightening as it places many different letters from healthy and the not so healthy relationships in one place. This book is refreshing in the sense that you can see the bad points in your relationship and move on. Giving you a wide range of author's this book gives you a large canvas to view relationships and their demise from. Some letters are from famous ladies, and the others are not so famous. I think the value of this is walking away with the knowledge that life goes on without that particular person in your life. All in all a book that evokes sympathy, laughter, and a tear or two.	2002-11-06

Lidia places so much of her life into this book. It deals with more than just delicious recipes.  Her book is packed with charming photos of her family throughout her life.  You can tell she pours her life into book.  The book is well organized and has a wide variety of Italian recipes, meaning this goes far beyond the traditional meatballs, and pasta.  Her recipes include all sorts of delicious soup recipes, pasta, meats, breads, and desserts.  With most recipes she gives you tips for what to do with left overs and how to reheat the recipes.

It is laid out in a logical order, and as it progresses it looks at every aspect in fine detail.  The book is filled with both general knowledge and covers a variety of basic business aspects as well as giving many examples of good and bad marketing.  I found many of the examples very amusing, and would leave a normal person wondering why would a large business employ such bad strategy as not to take local culture into account.  This book gives ideas on different countries; western europe, eastern europe, Japan, India, and many different Asian countries.  It is less developed for African marketing, while it does have some examples, it is also a less developed economy than the others.<br />Regardless if you are a student or a business person I think this book would be a great resource when studing marketing abroad.  It has so many examples of the blunders and the sucesses.	2002-11-01

Check this one out	I love this book.  It has recipes from all over Europe.  This book is very large containing about 300+ recipes.  Broken down into 14 different sections this book is likely to have just what you are looking for.  Each section has several different areas of recipes.  For example the vegetable section is broken down into hot soups, cold soups, stews, fried and roast vegetables, boiled, stuffed, salads, mushrooms, olive snd olive oil dishes, seaweed.  She takes her time with each recipe stating where it comes from, the approximate year, and sometimes additional hints and tips on the recipes.<br />This book is wonderful because you get to learn a bit about each culture, sometimes what they ate with a particular recipes, or when it was served.  It is also nice because many of the dishes are inexpensive to prepare and make great quanities.  Perfect if you are cooking for a good deal of people.  While this book is currently not in print, I would urge anyone looking for recipes from the Old World to take a chance on this book.	2002-10-25

This book isn't about extreme diets that the majority of the population in the US eats, but its about good food.  As others have stated all recipes in this book do not always watch salt and fat intake, we will assume if you are on a specialized diet you will follow it.  While fat in the diet may be bad for anyone that doesn't eat it in moderation, it makes some things taste better.  Each recipe does contain all nutritional info such as calories, fat saturated and unsaturated, cholestrol, so you are armed with the info you need to make wise choices.<br />Let's look at the wonderful range of recipes, Whole Foods has always had a unique position catering to Vegetarians, and Meat Eaters, this book accomodates both very well.  If you are Vegan you may want to thumb through a copy before you purchase as there tend to be a fewer amount of recipes for Vegans.  Recipes include things like Chipotle Potato Salad which was just yummy, Creole Rice and Bean Soup, Panang Green Pea Soup, all sorts of delicious desserts, salads, and much more.  If you are a person that likes to experiment with the every day, this book is for you.<br />There is a recipe on each page.  Each recipe is written very clearly and the instructions are easy to follow.  Most recipes have a paragraph about each recipe.  For example the Chipotle peppers are really dried jalopeno peppers that are smoked, I found this out when I made the Chipolte Potato Salad.  The recipes are something you would like to make for company.  I personally loved this book, and the variety of recipes found in here.	2002-10-25

While recipes are measured in both English and Metric, they are primarily measured by weight, not volume. Also many of the proportions are not for the home, but for industrial use. The book covers many areas of baking by going delving into ingredients, and their special characteristics. There is an almost 40 page primer on baking specifics such as yeast, temperatures you want you kitchen to be for rising of breads and much more. If you are looking for information about is about baking in general this book would more than serve you well as it covers so much, but its primary use would be best suited for a professional kitchen.	2002-10-22

Many of the recipes are for things we don't normally cook everyday; sweetmeats, game, and a variety of desserts that haven't been made in years.  The recipes are clear and concise.

It covers breads, desserts, main dishes, cooking for children, savory dishes, liquors, and much much more.

While this book isn't missing anything, wordages have been changed, be aware of this.  The typeset is in an old fashioned type setting and does add a bit of charm to the book.

This is one of the best books for creating patterns, choosing fabrics, editing a pattern for your personal size, as well as a great primer for what to wear that I have seen. Not being an expert in the sewing craft I need a little extra guidance, and this book delivers.<br />This book first of all does feature a nice area on garments on when they were worn historically. In a simple time line she demonstrates proper fabric choices as well as the styles that were around during those years.<br />The book is one of the few that features patterns for men, women, children, and even babies. Also included are maturnity patterns, shoes, and some hats.

This book is an angry outcry against those unscrupulous individuals that prey upon those in need.  I love the almost scientific scrutiny that is used to debunk these men.  He carefully examines several of these so called &quot;Faith Healers&quot;, and makes a poiant argument that those that take advantage of others in the name of religion should be prosecuted.<br />Being a magician himself he is aware of many tricks of the trade when it comes to manipulating an audience, and uses his own personal experience to unveil when others use similar techniques.  This book reminds me of the movie &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, but there is no happy ending in this book.

The introduction was very helpful as it throughly explains how this text was handed down and sometimes changed over the years.  This book contains the first 300 or so nights only, so this isn't a complete edition.  Containing only the first third is a bit of a disappointment, as you won't be able to put this one down.

While some people take the extreme of never having white flour, butter, or sugar.  I can't go in that extreme of eating direction.  I like this book as it tempers healthy ingredients and good tasting recipes with realistic ingredients.  I know some people feel that butter is entirely evil, but I really enjoy an occasional indulgence.  This book is well laid out, and the recipes are easy to read.	2002-05-10

This book has been truely eye opening, and has helped to prepare several very tasty meals since I have gotton this book.  This book is divided into several sections that deal with many different types of meat.  This book will help you save money by knowing what cuts of meats to look for.  For example, did you know that some cuts of the chuck steak are adjacent to a rib eye?  Next time gives those a look when you are hungry for ribeye at a savings of at least 4 to 5 dollars a pound.<br />The book has a wide variety of recipes ranging from the ordinary Sunday type comfort meals we all enjoy, to those that are a bit more creative.  I have really enjoyed their recipes for roast, different types of hamburers, and steak.  What I enjoy the most is that this book is both a recipe book, but also is educational in the sense that it takes away some of the mystery that we all have when step up to the meat counter.	2002-04-19

This book has a wide variety of recipes, and they are made with ingredients that are easy to find.  I was amazed at how many recipes can be made with ingredients that we have on hand.  This book is well organized, and best of all it offers a picture of every single recipe.  So you know what it is going to look like.  The recipes that I have tried have been very good, and enjoyable.  This book gets very high ratings since the recipes are written clearly, even for the begining cook.  My only minor complaint with this book is that all recipes are not given in their actual name but generic names.  Still if you are looking for a book for the beginner, or if you are just starting to get interested in Indian cooking, this is a great book to start with.	2002-04-15

This book is filled with wonderfully rich, and recipes that will tickle your tongue.  This book is is for those with a little cooking experience behind their apron.<br />Three of my favorite recipes out of this book was the Heart of Darkness Chocolate Cake, which was a cake that featured a soft gooey chocolate center surrounded by chocolate cake.  Happy All of the Time Cakes, which was a rich cocoa bourbon cake with a chocolate honey bourbon glaze.  And finally Mocha Mud Cake with Espresso Chocolate Chunk Mud Slide, need I say more.<br />You will feel you entered your own personal pastry shop with recipes like these.  The book has many photos of prepared recipes.  I like this book as the ingredient list is printed on the right hand side of the page, leaving almost an entire page for their very detailed instructions.  This book is very well put together, and will give you many tasty results that you are sure to enjoy.	2002-04-08

I love this book it is a book that focuses only on sourdough recipes.  The book starts off with telling you all about sourdough, and how to keep yours alive and healthy.  If you don't have a starter, this book gives you 8 recipes for different types of starter, best of all she lets you know what to expect, and how to keep it going, which is very important, as it only gets better with age.<br />The remainder of this book is filled, and I do mean filled with tons of recipes.  She goes beyond just bread, she has recipes on yes breads, biscuits, pancakes, cakes, main dishes and so much more.  This is an inexpensive book that is worth every penny for what it has to offer.  If you are even considering getting into sourdough bread making, I can't recommend this book enough.	2002-04-08

This books documents patterns for you, so you know exactly where they come from.  A few patterns have been inspired by their older counterparts.  The patterns are extremely well done, and are very clear so you know exactly what do so.  Some books give character symbols that are confusing, this does not.  They are large enough so you can photo copy them for your personal use.  Most patterns are done with a single color so this book is for beginners.  This book has one drawback, its limited availability.  Scoop this one up by all means if it is available.	2002-04-08

Sometimes cookbooks that have recipes that are from times past offer recipes that taste quite differently than what our modern expectations are.  This book will deliver you good recipes.  Two of the favorite ones I have tried from this book were the Almond Chicken and the Golden Leeks and Onions.  The instructions are very clear, and easy to read.  The book does offer lovely art work as well.  My only complaint about this book while the recipe that it has are very good, I just with their were more of them.  This is a good book to start or even add to a Medieval recipe collection.	2002-03-26

This book is a very well put together cookbook, that I have throughly enjoyed.  This book deals with some period recipes as well as more modern ones.  The recipe book is simply filled with tons of recipes, she does an excelling job of incorporating a wide variety of recipes into this book.  There are no pictures, but she does offer some background info on many recipes.<br />This book is worth its price for its Apple Orange Tart, which makes up the best apple pie recipe that I have had the pleasure of enjoying.  I would highly recommend this book if you are looking to flesh out your British collection of recipes, or if you are looking for a cookbook that offers a good selection of very good tasting period recipes.	2002-03-26

Let's be realistic, some of us, I include myself, can not do all of the things that are presented in this lovely book.  The cakes are wonderfully decorated, and they will amaze you.  Serve one of these and people will wonder if what you are serving is really a cake... But, for the rest of us, this is still a good book.  This book will give you wonderful ideas of what you can do, and some improvisions you can make.  While I can try to make a cake as beautiful as presented in this book, my attempts have been slightly less stunning, but none the less quite good.  I would encourage you if you dare to go that extra mile to give this book a try.	2002-01-28

I was drawn to these books in a self exploration.  Having never participated in the lifestyle of Dominance and Submission I found these books to be a beacon of light.  These three books take you through the journey of a submissive and her awakening desire, capture, and taming of her sexuality.  The books are written very explicitly, but unlike others they give you the main characters point of view, and what is going through her mind as she endures new aspects of her submissive life.  I found these books to be entirely intoxicating.	2001-12-02

This book has one draw back, you won't be preparing anything from it.  I have mainly used this book for a historical perspective, while gathering ideas for potential menus that I wish to make.  So often I have wondered what would have been period or what would have gone with a particular recipe that I was trying.  This book will aide you in this.	2001-11-30

Now there are times when we can't prepare something from scratch, and this book is perfect for those times.  By adding a few extra ingredients that are readily available in your pantry, you can turn somethin ordinary into something people will rave about, and beg you for the recipe.  Meanwhile you have accomplished this with a boxed cake mix, and things you normally have in the pantry.  I like this book more than the first book, as well it has one of the things that I enjoy the most.... Chocolate.  This book is packed with all sorts of recipes for cake(Chocolate Sour Cream Cake), brownies (Kaluhua Cream Cheese Brownies), and many other tasty creations.  The book is well written, easy to read and filled with serving suggestions and so much more.  I would highly recommend this book to you if you are looking for something a little special.	2001-11-20

Once again 1859, not 1959 or anything remotely close to us.  This book is about eating different types of animals.  How to eat flying lemurs, horses, and so much more.  If taken from a historical perspective this can be interesting.  Honestly I found this book a bit difficult to read, as they were talking about eating many endangered animals.<br />The printface remains from its original publishing, so you will not mistake this for a book that was written recently.  The book has no illustrations, but is in text only.  It is a bit interesting from an acedemic point of view.	2001-10-24

Being new to Indian cooking, I immediately appreciated this book for completely describing everything.  The author writes with a very personal touch in the written passages before the recipes.  What I really like is that she offers suggestions for substitutions, and where to get ingredients that I was not normally familiar with.  Many of this dishes have ingredients that have been found in my kitchen for years.  The book is broken down into various regions and the recipes have wonderful introductions to give a brief history on the recipe.<br />I would highly recommend this well written book to anyone interested in  Indian cooking.	2001-10-24

If you are looking for cookbooks from a historical perspective I found this book lacking in the textual references that books from Scully would have. I did find the variety of recipes to be more than you could ask for. I have tried a couple of the recipes, and they do taste well.

It is easy to read, laid out well, and has a picture of every type of cookie.  The recipes in the book are decent recipes, but they are not the best recipe for any particular type of cookie.  What I found helpful about this book is that I am sure you have wondered what does 'X' look like, this book does help with those mysteries.  This would be a fun book for a bake sale or something where you will get the opportunity to try out a bunch of different cookies.	2001-07-18

Reviving Ophelia is an excellent book describing what happens in a woman's transformation from child-teen-adult.  For the lucky ones the transition is painless, for others it is not.<br />I think this books gives those of us who have gone through growing up, and those of us who watch the others make this transformation an understanding of why this time can be so stressful and tramatic.  This alone helps with the pain and suffering that we can go through.  She gives several real life cases of others who were having a difficult time, and helps us to realize that this is a very common experience, and how we can best deal with the changes our lives makes from being a child to becoming a woman.	2001-07-15

Actually I would still consider this to be my final authority on many things.  While I do prefer the older edition for specifics on certain types of recipes/cooking methods/ect.  I do also enjoy the newer cookbook.  I like how it has changed in terms of it recoginizes that many of us work, have faced pace lifestyles, and life has changed.<br />In keeping with the times, new microwaveable recipes, new menu suggestions, and ideas on entertaining are shared.  I like that we aren't kept to the old, fast, rules of entertaining.  This book does a wonderful job of relieving the burden, while still providing you with an excellent background source for recipes.<br />One of the strengths of this cookbook is that they take the time to explain the background behind many of the recipes, foods, and differences of techinique.  Most coobkooks simply give you the recipe.  This would be an ideal cookbook for the newer cook looking for some extra guidence, and for some of us that have been around for a bit, it learn new things, and to become refreshed in our tastes.	2001-07-15

While Morton's version if Diana may be very flattering portraying her as the injured party, all persons recognize that she is human, and made mistakes.  If you are looking for a book that idolizes Diana, do not pick up this book.  In the same breath, I must say that this does not paint her as  a totally evil person either.<br />What I did like about the book was that she backed up details of Diana's life with fact, details, and very specific dates.  I feel an effort was made to make this book the most accurate that has come out yet.  I believe this book does a wonderful job in painting the despiration Diana so often felt and lived with.<br />I do not think any book can truely give us a picture of who Diana was, but at least this book gives us some insight to what was going on in during her life, her emotions, as well as possible reasons behind her at times strange actions.  I like many of you, admire Diana, and grew up watching what I thought was a fairy tale, it is strangely refreshing to see that in reality she was a person like you and I.  Sally Smith does a wonderful, and I feel respectful job of giving us a glimpse of Diana.	2001-07-15

Verghese's writing style is so unusual as he writes with humor, compassion, and keeps you fully informed as a outsider to his patients treatment, and their disease.  During the begining stages of our dealings with the AIDS virus we were so quick to judge the population that received AIDS rather than treating it as a disease that impacts not only the patient but their family.  Verghese is able to reflect a wholistic picture of the patient, and their family.  He was a person that was interested in the patient, the disease, and learning about the gay culture.  He did so in way that was free of prejudice, and it was a true learning experience.  I highly recommend this book for those that wish to read a good book as well as those that are interested in the early days of the AIDS epidemic.	2001-07-06

This book relates the Christian message behind the death penalty, civil disobediance, belief in faith, and your sprititual journey in life.  The book is well written and easy to understand.  Each chapter starts out with a chapter in one of the Gospels and then relates it to modern day life.  I will be forever changed by the reading of this book.	2001-07-04

This will keep you out of the kitchen, and it will still enable you to put food on your table.  I love this book, not so much for the recipes, they are good, but the idea and the methods of cooking ahead of time.  Cooking ahead of enables you to save money by selecting ingredients with recipes in mind, instead of shopping randomly.  You can also save time when you prepare similar dishes.  For example when you make pasta sauce you can make spaghetti, manticotti, and lasange all from the same sets of ingredients.<br />I  have not fully adapted to their methods, but I was able to stay out of the grocery store, and prepare several meals at once to serve all week.

It was not the difficulty of the reading, but the moral challenges it brings.  I felt the book presented far too many moral issues that are at hand.  The book dealt with war, the death penalty, gun control and abortion, as well as many other ideas.  I have been forced to re-examine some of my personal views after reading this book.<br /> The book vehemently opposes war.  I have to wonder if, at times, this isn't a necessary evil.  My guess is that Brown would have suggested passive resistance to Hitler in World War II.  I simply have a hard time coming to Brown's conclusion.  In the Old Testament of the Bible, God sanctioned War at times.  In my understanding of the parable, the turning of weapons into plowshares was meant for the millennium.  It is not meant for the current dispensation that mankind is in. We are told in the Bible that there will be wars and rumors of wars until the body of Christ is taken into heaven.  I find Brown's comment of trying to bring about his own personal millennium to be extremely arrogant.  While war is a terrible thing, I feel we are expressly told that this will happen.<br /> Brown is opposed to guns and believes in gun control.  I have to agree that guns in the wrong hands can be used for evil.  Is a gun in itself truly evil?  I cannot ask the police to go against criminals without appropriate protection.  I cannot go as far as to believe that all violence will magically cease without guns.  To assume without guns our society will be safe and violence free is to have an overly optimistic view.<br /> I cannot agree with his statement that breaking laws is always appropriate to save human life.  To agree to this statement blindly is to become a zealot, and lose good judgment.  With this statement members of the anti-abortion movement are perfectly justified in bombing clinics, and the occasional murder of doctors and other medical professionals.  Out right murder is never justifiable.<br /> I feel this book is extremely thought provoking.  It is radical enough to have created a large discomfort level in my personal belief system.  I feel Brown's points are often well made, and thankfully peppered with fact.  I feel that too many concepts were approached for me on a personal level.  Each chapter presented a different moral dilemma.  His writing style attempted to sensationalize points rather than investigate them in a logical manner.  I can truly say this is a book that I will always remember.feel this book is extremely thought provoking.  It is radical enough to have created a large discomfort level in my personal belief system.

I wish the book would have went over ways to do basic things, and how to improvise from that point.  Instead it turns into very complex cooking.
