Many thousands of lives could have been saved if vitamin C had been readily available as it is now.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the power of vitamin C to fight influenza is still not acknowledged by the orthodox medical establishment, even though numerous published scientific studies have shown vitamin C, at adequate doses, to be very powerful at killing viruses and, thus, protecting us from their ill effects. One reason for this misunderstanding is that the orthodox medical establishment considers only about 90 mg of vitamin C daily to be needed by humans, and this dosage will not fight influenza. However, the actual dosage of vitamin C most humans need is at least 2,000 mg each day under normal conditions and much higher amounts when an infection starts to occur.  <br /> <br />For those who are willing to consider the benefits of vitamin C and other nutrients in fighting illness, I recommend the book How to Feel Better and Live Longer by Dr. Linus Pauling, the only person to have won two unshared Nobel Prizes.	2005-10-11

However, I'd like to emphasize the importance of selenium for fighting cancer. Selenium is the cancer-fighting nutrient most proven to date. A daily supplement of 200 microgram of selenium, has been shown in a large placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study -- the most prestigious type of scientific study of nutrients and drugs -- to cut the death rate from cancer in half. <br /> <br />Specifically, a large group of people who were given each day a yeast tablet enriched with 200 micrograms (mcg) of selenium had only half the number of deaths from cancer over a seven year period as a similarly large control group who were given a daily yeast tablet containing no selenium. Yeast tablets enriched with 200 mcg of selenium are readily available at pharmacies as well as health stores across the U.S. for about $5 or so for a bottle of 50 to 100 tablets -- only 10 cents or less per day -- I do. <br /> <br />The results of this dramatic study were published in the medical profession's own journal: The Journal of the American Medical Association.

To my pleasant surprise the supplemental magnesium not only cured the ailment for which I was taking it, it also completely stopped my episodes of acid reflux and heartburn. I have since learned that acid reflux is caused by stomach spasms which cause acid (which healthy stomachs are designed by nature to tolerate and utilize) to be ejected into the esophagus which is not designed to be exposed to stomach acid and burns when it is so exposed. Magnesium is a natural relaxant -- as well as a natural antacid -- and, therefore, it helps prevent the stomach spasms which are the root cause of acid reflux and accompanying heartburn. I am a research chemist, not a physician, so I cannot tell you to take chelated magnesium as I did.

It pleased me to be named after someone who was the subject of a book but, for some reason, I never bothered to ask my mother for details about either the book or its principal character, although she often spoke glowingly about the David for whom I was named. After my mother's death I regretted not having queried her for more details about Just David and its hero whom she so admired. When I found that Just David was available from Amazon.com I immediately ordered a copy and read it as soon as it arrived.

In The Open Society and It's Enemies he presents not only the case for democracy (an open society) but also the case against tyranny (a closed society), no matter how benevolent any given tyranny purports to be. Popper also explains why many people are still attracted to tyranical forms of government -- whether fascist or communist. Such people prefer order to freedom. One of the paradoxes presented by Popper is that some degree of inefficiency is endemic to democracy, whereas highly-efficient government -- which many people think they want -- is almost invariably tyrannical. This book is a must read for everyone interested in maintaining individual freedom and understanding the threats which it constantly faces.	2005-05-15

This seemingly sensible but restricted view -- called homogeneous atmospheric chemistry -- failed to account for much of the actual behavior and content of the atmosphere. Fortunately, a few scientists noted that the atmosphere also contains non-gaseous components, including clouds and soot and dust particles and investigated whether the interaction of these liquid and solid atmospheric species with the the atmosphere's gases -- heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry -- might be important. The answer was yes, heterogeneous chemistry is an important factor in the complex chemistry of the atmosphere. Unfortunately, this \\"maverick\\" view of the importance of heterogeneous processes in the atmosphere was either ignored or scoffed at for several years. Eventually NASA and the National Research Foundation decided to hold a national conference to bring together scientists from both sides of this debate to determine the true significance of heterogeneous processes in the atmosphere. Fortunately, significant agreement was reached that both homogeneous and heterogeneous processes are important in the study of atmospheric chemistry. This book is a collection of technical papers which resulted from that pivotal conference. <br /> <br />I must, in fairness, note that I have some bias regarding this book since I was a research scientist at NASA who helped organize that conference and I am the technical editor of this book which resulted from it. I should also note that this book was so widely distributed within the atmospheric science research community that it required a second printing and that Russian scientists thought highly enough of it to republish it in a Russian translation.	2005-01-27

In high school and college mathematics courses it is generally stated that, since the square root of  -1 cannot be expressed as any real number, it must be a so-called imaginary number, usually designated as i. Furthermore, any number multiplied by i, say 2i, is also said to be imaginary. So-called imaginary numbers generally cause even very bright students some discomfiture, as well they should. <br />But, in fact, i is not an imaginary number (whatever an imaginary number would mean); rather it is something quite real: a 90 degree rotational operator. Mathematical operators -- including rotational operators -- are beyond the average person's knowledge (or interest) of mathematics, but at least they are real. And they are also quite useful, not only in mathematics but in various fields on science and engineering.<br />In this fascinating book Nahin traces the history of the  centuries-long struggles which the concept of negative numbers and, eventually, of their square roots caused both mathematicians and philosophers until an obscure Norwegian surveyor discovered the true meaning of i in 1797.<br />As a scientist who spent decades using i -- but never really accepted the traditional view that it is an imaginary number -- I was overjoyed when I finally discovered its real meaning.<br />Clearly this book is not for everyone; but it should be quite interesting to anyone who, like I, never full accepted the concept of an imaginary number.	2004-04-27

For far too many years the mineral magnesium has been largely overlooked as a nutrient which is essential for good health. Most doctors and laboratories don't even include magnesium status in routine blood tests. Thus, most doctors don't know when their patients are deficient in magnesium, even though the majority of Americans are deficient in magnesium. And magnesium deficiency is very important. In fact, magnesium deficiency is a significant factor -- often the major factor -- in many severe illnesses including heart attacks and other forms of heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma, anxiety and panic attacks, depression, fatigue, diabetes, migraines and other headaches, osteoporosis, insomnia, and most cases of muscular problems. Because magnesium deficiency is largely overlooked, millions of Americans suffer needlessly from the foregoing ailments or are having their symptoms treated with expensive drugs (which often have unpleasant or dangerous side effects) when they could be cured with magnesium supplementation. This excellent and easily-readable new book by Dr. Dean discusses these and other important aspects of the essential mineral magnesium in detail. Everyone who is concerned about his or her health should acquire and read this very important book. So should their doctors.	2003-01-04

Although it is not commonly known, deficiency of magnesium is a significant risk factor for various forms of heart disease. One of the major causes of heart attacks -- which can occur even in people with ideal cholesterol levels and virtually no arterial blockage -- is a spasm of the muscles surrounding a coronary artery. Deficiency of magnesium is the most common cause of such arterial spasms, and approximately 80% of Americans suffer from some degree of magnesium deficiency. Magnesium deficiency can also contribute to cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. And magnesium deficiency is also a major cause of heart irregular heart beats and heart palpitations. (Another deficiency which can cause these symptoms is deficiency of potassium, but magnesium deficiency is generally the more common cause.) Doctors can temporarily stabilize irregular heart beats with injections of a magnesium compound, but they rarely do so except in emergency situations. However, people with an irregular heart beat caused by magnesium deficiency can generally cure the problem simply by taking 500 mg to 1,000 mg of a magnesium supplement daily -- and,  in doing so they also help protect themselves from heart attacks and congestive heart failure, as mentioned above. <br />The preferred form of supplemental magnesium is chelated magnesium because it is readily absorbed by the body and also because other forms of supplemental magnesium may cause diarrhea.<br />Although the emphasis in this book is on the role of magnesium in maintaining a healthy heart, it should be noted that magnesium can also help prevent headaches and muscular cramps and is a natural relaxant which can help relieve anxiety disorders and counteract stress. Please read this book and be sure that you are getting enough magnesium -- one of the most frequently overlooked nutrients.	2002-11-22

Most people seem to regard headaches as a natural consequence of the stresses of life. I used to think this way myself -- one or more headaches were a weekly occurrence for me. Then I began to learn about the importance of vitamins and minerals in human health and starting taking nutrient supplements including magnesium and B vitamins. Since then my headaches have virtually disappeared. <br />One of the major causes of headaches -- including migraines -- is deficiency of magnesium, which is a natural relaxant. And studies have found that about 80% of Americans don't get enough magnesium in their diet. The result is that Americans suffer inordinately from headaches (including migraines), muscle cramps, and various forms of anxiety and stress disorders. But magnesium deficiency --which causes these ailments -- is easily remedied by taking supplemental magnesium. The preferred form of supplemental magnesium is chelated magnesium because it is readily absorbed by the body and because other forms of magnesium supplements sometimes cause diarrhea.<br />As pointed out by the authors of this book, the B vitamin niacin and the herb feverfew are also helpful in preventing and treating migraine headaches.

Modern medicine can performs wondrous feats of surgery and has conquered virtually all of the infectious diseases that were the major causes of death a century ago. But we are now plagued with a host of non-infectious diseases -- including cancer, various forms of heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and osteoporosis -- for which modern medicine can only treat symptoms but has no cure. Why? Because most of our modern diseases are caused by improper eating habits and lack of nutrition. Unfortunately, the conventional medical establishment is only beginning to recognize this fact and many doctors -- despite their excellent training in the use of pharmaceutical drugs (which kill more than 100,00 people each year with their side effects) -- are comepletely ignorant of the true causes of modern chronic diseases. Fortunately, the authors of this book have thoroughly researched the true causes of modern diseases and found that they lie in nutrient deficiency and in the current and erroneous fad of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet -- plus excessive consumption of junk food. Our eating habits are deteriorating our health and even killing us prematurely. But, fortunately, we have the power to change our eating habbits and reclaim our health if we are willing to do so.

Cardiologist, Dr.Stephen Sinatra, is best know for his excellent book The Coenzyme Q10 Phenomenon which discusses in detail the role of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in maintaining a strong, healthy heart. While CoQ10 is indeed essential for heart health so is the less well known nutrient L-carnitine. L-carnitine is so important to our bodies -- especially our hearts -- that our bodies manufacture it every day. Unfortunately, however, many people don't manufacture enough L-carnitine to maintain optimum health and some people manufacture so little L-carnitine that their heart muscles become severly weakened for lack of it. Fortunately, L-carnitine is readily available as a nutritional supplement so that anyone who is deficient in this important nutrient can remedy this deficiency by taking supplemental L-carnitine. For people who are deficient in L-carnitine, supplementation can significantly improve their health, and for those who are severly deficienct it can even save their lives. All of this is discussed by Dr. Sinatra in highly-readable terms in this excellent book. Incidentally, L-carnitine not only helps keep our hearts healthy and gives us energy it also helps us burn fat and thus can contribute to weight loss. All health conscious people would do well to read this important book.	2002-10-31

For decades Mary Roberts Rinehart was the queen of mystery thrillers -- the American Agatha Christie. These are the first two mystery novels she wrote and they are genuine classics. Although The Man in Lower Ten was written first, The Circular Staircase was Rinehart's first published novel (The Man in Lower Ten was published second and The Swimming Pool was her last mystery novel). Rinehart's special gift was in the evocation of an unremitting atmosphere of unease and potential danger and it is under such an atmosphere of apprehension that she spun her classic stories. The Man in Lower Ten -- in which a man is murdered in his berth in a railroad Pullman car -- was so scary and so popular that for some time after its publication travellers refused to sleep in any Pullman berth numbered lower 10. Unfortunately, for many years the classic mystery novels of Mary Roberts Rinehart were dismissed by many as old fashioned. This may apply to superficial details -- such as gas lighting and railroad Pullman cars -- but it definitely is not true of the novels themselves which are timeless in their ability to hold the reader in a grip of mystery and suspense. The Circular Staircase is one of the finest mystery novels ever written and The Man in Lower Ten is fitting companion in this first book of the new Essential Rinehart Collection. If you love good mystery/suspense novels please do yourself a favor and get to know the classics by this master of the genre.	2002-10-13

For decades Mary Roberts Rinehart was the queen of mystery thrillers -- the American Agatha Christie. The Circular Staircase was her first published novel and The Swimming Pool was her last, and all of her mystery novels between these two -- including The Wall -- were outstanding. Rinehart's special gift was in the evocation of an underlying and unremitting atmosphere of unease, suspence, and potential danger and it is under such an atmosphere of apprehension that she spins her stories. For some time it has been fashionable to dismiss the novels of Mary Roberts Rinehart as old fashioned. This may apply to superficial details of her early novels -- such as gas light instead of electricity -- but it definitely is not true of the novels themselves which are timeless in their ability to hold the reader in a grip of mystery and suspense. The Wall is an excellent mystery novel. Like all of Rinehart's mysteries it is full of suspense and danger. As in any good mystery, clues are sprinkled throughout -- but they are never obvious -- and the ending is both logical and surprising. If you like mysteries, but haven't yet read any by this master of the genre, this is a good one to start with. If you read it, you'll probably get more of Rinehart's outstanding mystery novels.	2002-10-11

For decades Mary Roberts Rinehart was the queen of mystery thrillers -- the American Agatha Christie. Rinehart's special gift was in the evocation of an overlying and unremitting atmosphere of unease and potential danger and it is under such an atmosphere of apprehension that she spins her stories. The Window at the White Cat was the first Rinehart mystery I read (The Circular Staircase was her first published novel) and I liked it so much that I began to read virtually all of her mystery novels -- many of them more than once. The White Cat in the title is the name of a seedy political hangout in which a killing occurs and the story is a mixture of political shenanigans, romance -- and, above all -- mystery and suspense. The Window at the White Cat is a terrific mystery novel and a very good introduction to the mystery novels of a master of the genre.	2002-10-11

For the past few decades Americans have been told that eating less of everything containing fat is the requisite for losing weight. And yet, over this same period, literally millions of Americans have gone through life eating low-fat diets and being perpetually hungry, but more Americans are overweight now than before this dogma was foisted upon them. Fortunately, Dr. Earl Mindell -- who gave us the best-selling Earl Mindell's Vitamin Bible and related other health books -- has written a book which explains the defects in the conventional avoid-fat/go-hungry dogma of weight loss and tells in easily-understandable language how to lose weight without going hungry. A major factor which Dr. Mindell points out is that excess consumption of carbohydrates -- especially sugar -- not excess consumption of fat, is the major cause of excess weight. Currently the average American eats a staggering 133 lbs of sugar each year, generally without realizing how much sugar they are consuming. Partly this is because in order to make low-fat foods taste appetizing the food industry has loaded our food with sugar. Another reason we eat so much sugar is because the majority of American are deficient in the mineral chromium and chromium deficiency causes sugar cravings. Eating foods rich in chromium, or taking an appropriate chromium supplement, can significantly reduce, or even eliminate, sugar cravings. And decreased consumption of sugar and other carbohydrates is a major factor in losing weight without going hungry. The huge amount of sugar and other carbohydrates currently being eaten by many American is also the major cause of the current increase in type II diabetes. All of these matters are discussed in easily understandable terms in this invaluable book. If you want to lose weight without starving yourself and avoid type II diabetes, this book is a good place to start.	2002-10-04

The importance of vitamins in human health is at last becoming recognized; but, unfortunately, minerals -- which are equally important -- are still largely overlooked. Yes, most books on vitamins give some coverage to well-known minerals such as calcium, and perhaps even magnesium and zinc are briefly discussed. Rarely, however, will books on vitamins tell you that magnesium deficiency is significantly associated with heart attacks and that magnesium is required for the functioning of 300 enzymes which regulate human health -- more enzymes than are regulated by any vitamin. Furthermore, few books on vitamins cover the full spectrum of minerals and trace elements -- including boron, lithium, and vanadium -- which are discussed in detail in this excellent little book. This book discusses minerals which are essential for good health and other minerals which are toxic, as well as minerals which are essential in small quantities but toxic in large doses. Selenium, for example, can help prevent cancer in daily microgram dosages but is toxic in mg dosages. If you are interested in using nutrients to maintain your health, think about minerals as well as vitamins. This book is an excellent guide to minerals and trace elements.	2002-09-27

The latest version is entitled Earl Mindell's Vitamin Bible for the 21st Century. The various editions of Earl Midell's Vitamin Bible have taken away much of the mystery regarding nutrient supplements and improved the health of millions of readers. Now Dr. Mindell has written a book which specificallly adresses the role of vitamins, minerals, and other natural substances in preventing many of the deleterious effects of aging. It is a worthy companion to his Vitamin Bible and should be read -- and kept handy for reference -- by everyone, either for themselves or an aging family member.

Books	5	34	39	N	N	How to get and stay healthy and live longer.	The view of orthodox medicine is that one is well if one is not  overtly sick. However, in truth, most Americans who are not overtly sick are not really healthy -- they're just not overtly sick for the time being. Over the past few decades a new paradigm has developed whose goal is the prevention of disease and the achievement of true health, as well the extension of lifespan with minimal symptoms of aging. This new paradigm -- which has been shown conclusively to work -- is called \\"alternative\\" or \\"holistic\\" medicine. Dr. Julian Whitaker is one of the leading experts of this new paradigm of health. In this book he explains in simple terms how you can get and stay healthy and live a long healthy life by (1) eating a genuinely healthy diet (not the government's overly simplistic food pyramid), and taking certain nutritional supplements, (2) getting moderate (but regular) excercise, and (3) weaning one's self from most pharmaceutical drugs (most of which has harmful side effects) which truly healthy people rarely need. Sadly, Dr. Whitaker's prescription for health has not yet won over most othodox physicians but it is supported by thousands of scientific studies and has been experienced by hundreds of thousands of people who have had the courage to try it. I can't recommend this book too highly.	2002-08-30

Although cholesterol is an essential constituent of the human body it is commonly spoken of as if it were a toxic substance which should be avoided as completely as possible. The truth is that, far from being an undesirable toxic substance, cholesterol is an essential constituent of the human body. Cholesterol is so important to our bodies that they actually manufacture it. In fact, our bodies typically manufacture two-thirds or more of the cholesterol which they contain. Only one-third or less of the cholesterol in our bodies comes from the foods we eat.<br />Yet, despite the importance of cholesterol to our bodies, the frenzy to avoid it has become so strong that many wholesome foods which happen to be rich in cholesterol -- such as eggs -- have seen their consumption plummet, whereas all sorts of junk foods which do not contain cholesterol have their lack of cholesterol emblazoned on their containers and in their advertising, and many health-conscious people buy and eat them them despite their low nutritional content -- and, frequently, dangerously high sugar content. <br />The current obsession with cholesterol levels came about because cholesterol is (incorrectly) alleged to be the principal cause of clogged arteries and resultant heart disease. However, many people with high cholesterol levels never get any form of heart disease; and, on the other hand, many other people with \\"ideal\\" blood cholesterol levels die of heart attacks. Furthermoore, statistics now indicate that cholesterol levels which are too low may be risky. Low blood cholesterol levels have been shown to correlate significantly with increased incidence of cancer as well as with increased incidence of depression, violent behavior, and suicide. Clearly the cholesterol situation is not as simple as it's often portrayed to the public.<br />This book discusses the truth about cholesterol and discusses the real causes of atherosclerosis and heart disease. If you are concerned about staying healthy andliving longer -- and are willing to cope with information which goes against orthodox dogma -- I beg you to read this book.	2002-08-18

For the past few decades we have been told a dogma that has recently been shown by research to be not true: that the major cause of heart disease is cholesterol. Because of this erroneous dogma, many Americans have significantly reduced their consumption of healthy foods -- such as eggs -- simply because they contain cholesterol, and eaten unhealthy foods rich in sugar because they don't contain cholesterol. The surprising truth is that cholesterol is not a bad substance to be avoided but rather is an important biochemical which is essential for human health. Cholesterol is so essential that our bodies actually manufacture it; in fact, humans typically manufacture 3 to 4 times more cholesterol than we get from food. Well, if cholesterol is not the cause of heart disease, what is? The answer is that the two major causes of the arterial blockage which can lead to heart attacks are free radicals (which can be combatted by antioxidants such as vitamin C, Vitamin E, and selenium) and homocysteine. Homocysteine is a natural substance which is formed from metabolism of the amino acid methionine. Vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid can keep the concentration of homocysteine in our bodies low enough to be safe. But if we are deficienct in these essential vitamins -- as many people are -- the level of homocysteine in our blood rises dangerously and can induce the formation of arterial plaque which blocks the arteries and leads to heart attacks. High levels of homocysteine are far more dangerous than high cholesterol levels. In this book the man who discovered this fact, Dr. Kilmer McCully, discusses in readable terms the importance of keeping homocysteine levels low and dispells the myth that foods containing cholesterol -- many of which are quite good for us -- are dangerous. You need to know and understand this new paradigm if you want to preserve your health and protect yourself from heart attacks. As a research chemist, I can't recommend this important book too highly.	2002-08-18

A few years ago the results of a large double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study of selenium supplementation was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The multi-year study showed that people given 200 micrograms of supplemental selenium daily had only HALF the death rate from cancer as people who were given a placebo instead of selenium. No harmful side effects were observed. Has your doctor told you about this study or recommended that you take supplemental selenium to reduce your risk of cancer? I doubt it. He or she may well be unaware of this study; or, if aware, has dismissed it because it involved a simple, readily-available nutrient rather than a new wonder drug. But, if any pharmaceutical drug were available which cut the cancer death rate in half with no harmful side effects  -- and none currently is -- you would see ads for it plastered on TV and magazines and your doctor would readily prescribe it for you. So if you want to reduce your risk of cancer with selenium you're probably not going to get the information you need from your doctor. However, you can get it from this book. By the way, perhaps your doctor or a friend may tell you that selenium is toxic. It is in large doses, but it is quite safe in the 200 microgram dosage used in the JAMA study which, as noted above, found no harmful side effects. Cancer is a disease that we all dread, but now you have the power to significantly reduce your risk. Please supply yourself with the information you need to do so.	2002-08-18

In fact, many slender people with &quot;ideal&quot; cholesterol levels have plaque-filled arteries which result in heart attacks.  What medical dogma has overlooked until quite recently is that plaque builds up only in arteries that have been wounded in some fashion. Arterial plaque is, in essence a form of scab that forms on wounded arteries to protect us from internal hemorrhaging. What causes wounded arteries? One cause is free radicals, which can be combatted by antioxidants. But a second major cause of arterial wounding -- and arterial plaque -- was discovered by the author of this book, Dr. Kilmer McCully: elevated concentrations in the blood of a chemical called homocysteine. Homocysteine is a natural product of the metabolism af an amino acid called methionine and, therefore, our body's always contain some homocysteine. Vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid keep blood concentrations of homocysteine low enough to be safe. But deficiency of these vitamins can allow homocysteine to build up to concentrations that can wound our arteries and lead to the formation of arterial plaque -- which can eventually trigger a heart attack. Recent research has confirmed Dr. McCully's findings. If you want to understand the role of homocysteine in causing cardiovascular disease and resultant heart attacks -- and learn how to protect yourself from them -- I strongly suggest that you acquire and read this valuable book.	2002-08-16

He also notes that the growth and vitality of its middle class helped America surpass European nations in which most of the wealth was in the hands of a small, very-wealthy elite. Unfortunately, the size and financial well-being of the middle class in America declined in the 1980s and 1990s and is still in decline today. The vast majority of the wealth of Anmerica is now in the hands of the very rich who comprise less than 1% of the population. In fact, the dominance of the rich is now greater in America than in any European country. Abundant evidence emerges almost weekly that this huge imbalance of wealth has corrupted both our politics and our corporations -- and lowered the standard of living of a significant fraction of the non-rich. Phillips believes that if this situation is not reversed and the rich continue to overwhelmingly dominate the middle class, then America will decline in power as surely as the Eupope of the Hapsburgs and the British empire. I fear that he may well be right. Is there still time to reverse this situation and enhance the vitality of the middle class while capping the political power of the rich? I hope so. The recent and ongoing revelations of greed and corruption in many of our largest corporations could serve as a healthy wake-up call. However, if we igore these and other warnings -- and dismiss Phillips simply as a biased liberal -- then the end of American prosperity and world dominance could well come within the lives ofthe vast majority of those alive today. Please think about the issues which Phillips raises befor it is too late.	2002-08-13

Now many corporations are suffering from the same problem: downsizing, pushing their remaining employees to the limit, yet becoming less profitable and, in many cases, eventually going bankrupt. Apparently the breakneck 24/7 paradigm of modern life is seriously flawed.

The plot is outstanding, the atmosphere is unremittingly tense and apprehensive, and the conclusion is totally surprising without being contrived. If you like good mysteries you will probably love The Bat.	2000-11-03

For decades Mary Roberts Rinehart was the queen of mystery thrillers -- the American Agatha Christie. The Circular Staircase was Rinehart's first published novel (The Swimming Pool was her last), but it is a well-constructed work in ever way. Rinehart's special gift was in the evocation of an overlying and unremitting atmosphere of unease and potential danger and it is under such an atmosphere of apprehension that she spins her stories. For some time it has been fashionable to dismiss the novels of Mary Roberts Rinehart as old fashioned. This may apply to superficial details -- such as gas lighting -- but it definitely is not true of the novels themselves which are timeless in their ability to hold the reader in a grip of mystery and suspense. The Circular Stasircase is one of the finest mystery novels ever written.	2000-11-03

A comparison of the horoscopes of two people can yield much useful information about whether they will be attracted to each other and, if a relationship occurs, what the nature of that relationship is likely to be. This book is an excellent introduction to how to make such horoscope comparisons and contains the detailed information required for doing so. Incidentally, although horoscope comparisons are often done to see the potential for a successful romantic relationship or marriage, such comparisons are equally valid for any two people including siblings, coworkers, etc.	2000-10-25

A lot of people suffer -- and I do mean suffer -- from one or more phobias, and a lot of techniques are offered by various therapists to treat phobias. Unfortunately, while some of these treatments may reduce phobic symptoms somewhat, relatively few phobics are actually cured. In this excellent book, Dr. Harold Levinson explains the reasons for this situation. One is that there are three different types of phobias, a fact not generally recognized. About 5% or so of phobias are caused primarily by a neurotic condition of some sort. These phobias often respond to conventional psychotherapy whereas most phobias do not. Another 5% or so of phobias are caused by a severe trauma, such as being bitten by a dog or being in a plane that almost crashes. These phobias are often helped by desensitization therapy. But if phobias that are caused primarily by neurosis or trauma account for only about 10% of all phobias, what is the primary cause of the other 90%? Dr. Levinson's brilliant discovery is that the root cause of most phobias is a disorder of the cerebellar-vestibular sustem, called in lay terminology &quot;the inner ear.&quot; Dr. Levinson also found that inner ear disorders are the primary cause of dyslexia and that there is a very high correlation between dyslexia and phobias. About 90% of people who are phobic or dyslexic are both phobic and dylexic. Fortunately, Dr. Levinson has found that about 80% of cases of both phobias and dyslexia respond to at least one of the inner ear medications currently available, including dramamine, scopolamine, and Benadryl. Inner ear disorders are relatively easy for trained audiologists to detect and verify by the battery of tests available to them, but they seldom are detected by routine examinations made by general practitioners or even ear, nose, and throat specialists. If you suffer from phobias and/or dyslexia -- as I do -- please read this book with an open mind. It may literally change your life for the better. In my case, thorough audiological testing -- as described in this book -- revealed that I do indeed have an inner ear disorder which was not detected by routine examinations. Based on this finding, my physician tried the inner ear medications listed by Dr. Levinson and found one that has given me significant relief. Therefore, I am recommending this book from personal experience.	2000-10-20

The orthodox medical establishment doesn't yet realize it but America is in the midst of a major shift in the paradigm of health. To its credit orthodox medicine has conquered virtually all of the infections diseases which were the major ailments a century ago, but it has made little progress against the major ailments of our time -- heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and other degenerative diseases -- because it refuses to recognize what Linus Pauling saw clearly: these diseases are caused by nutrient deficiencies. They will not be cured by pharmaceutical drugs with harmful side effects but rather with appropriate nutrient supplementation -- especially vitamin C. Linus Pauling was a genius. He was the only person ever to win two unshared Nobel Prizes and, quite probably, was the greatest chemist of the 20th century. In this book he presents his simple common sense prescription for a long healthy life. I wish everyone would read this book and heed Pauling's advice. By the way, recently the American Medical Association reversed its long-standing opposition to nutrient supplements and now recommends them. Get this book and get the details about nutrient supplementation from the expert on this subject, Linus Pauling.	2000-10-17

At the beginning of this book Immanuel Velikovsky asks the intriguing, and quite reasonable, question: Why does the Oedipus legend have a sphinx outside of the Greek city of Thebes, when the sphinx is not part of Greek mythology? He then points out that Egypt, which has a very famous sphinx, also has a city named Thebes. Could the Oedipus legend be a Greek retelling of a historical event that took place in Egypt? From these speculations Velikovsky goes on to present an immense body of data and convincing interpretation of such data, to show that events and people surrounding the ancient Egyptian Pharaoh, Akhnaton, correspond to the major elements and characters in the Oedipus story. This is one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. I realize that many scientists are highly skeptical of Velikovsky's books showing various allegedly mythical stories to have a basis in historical evidence. I am a scientist with 43 years experience at a major research laboratory, and I find many of Velikovsky's positions to be both logical and based on sound historical and archeological evidence. Velikovsky was not a crackpot as some would claim; rather he was one of the most brilliant thinkers of the 20th century.	2000-10-03

For years I wondered why it is often very difficult to convince even highly-intelligent of a new fact or idea, no matter how much evidence there may be supporting the new concept. Then I read this book and learned that even intelligent people often find it difficult to even hear or see evidence for anything which lies outside their current mindset -- or &quot;paradigm.&quot; Even great scientists and astute business men time and again fail to see or hear compelling evidence for new concepts that lie outside their current paradigm -- and, thus, significant ideas and opportunities are lost to them. However, in the present time of rapid change, we simply cannot continue to be held back by our old paradigms. This book is essential reading for those who wish to be able to cope with the rapidly-changing present and future.	2000-10-03

Superficially, The Captain is a very well written novel about life aboard a sea-going tugboat pressed into service as an escort vessel for convoys to Brtitain in the early days of World War II. Read at this level, The Captain is a rousing, highly-readable adventure story with interesting, well-developed characters. But there is much more than rousing adventure to this book which skillfully probes many deeply-fundamental matters, including  the horrors of war and the true nature of human courage. In my opinion, this is one of the most greatest novels ever written.	2000-09-28

It  catalyzes the formation and utilization of energy in every human cell.  Fortunately, our bodies manufacture CoQ10. Unfortunately, some people do  not manufacture enough CoQ10 to keep them healthy, especially as they grow  older. Research has shown that deficiency of CoQ10 is the major cause of  cardiomyopathy, and congestive heart failure and these diseases can often  be cured by CoQ10 supplementation. Even many heart transplant candidates  have no longer needed a heart transplant after supplementation with CoQ10.  Now it has been found that CoQ10 can also prevent -- and, sometimes, even  cure -- cancer, as well a variety of other diseases. Dr. Stephen Sinatra --  a board-certified cardiologist -- is a world-renowned expert on CoQ10 and  its health benefits. I beg your to buy and read this book and heed Dr.  Sinatra's information and advice.	2000-09-17

Animals don't get heart attacks but people do because most animals  manufacture vitamin C in their bodies but humans do not have this ability;  and vitamin C is ESSENTIAL for strong, healthy arteries, as well as for a  healthy immune system. Animals -- except for humans, other primates  (monkeys and apes), guinea pigs and a few fruit-eating birds and bats --  not only manufacture vitamin C every day, they manufacture a lot of it. A  typical animal manufactures 20 mg or more every day PER POUND OF BODY  WEIGHT. If your cat or dog, for example, weighs 10 lbs, he or she  manufactures 200 mg or more of vitamin C daily. Yet the official  recommended daily intake of vitamin C for humans is only 60 mg. That's only  enough for a 3 lb. animal, but it's supposed to be enough for a 125 lb.  woman or a 175 lb. man. It's supposed to be enough, but it isn't. Humans  need as much vitamin C as animals, we just can't manufacture our own like  most of them can. Most 125 lb. women need at least 2,500 mg of vitamin C  daily and most 200 lb. men neeed at least 3,500 mg. You may think that a  glass of orange juice every day meets all of your need for vitamin C but,  in fact, it falls far short. Given our shortage of vitamin C, it's not  surprising that humans get cardiovascular diseases -- including heart  attacks -- that most animals don't. Read this book and learn how with  appropriate vitamin C supplementation you can virtually eliminate your risk  of having a heart attack. This book could litterally save your life.	2000-09-17

Popular astrology, as most people think of it, deals exclusively with sun  signs -- the astrological sign in which the sun was located at your date of  birth. But the moon and each of the planets were also in a sign when you  were born -- and each might be in a different sign. Serious astrology takes  into consideration your moon sign and the signs in which each planet was  located at your birth time, as well as your sun sign. This collection of  the positions of the &quot;lights&quot; (sun and moon) and planets in the  zodiac of signs makes up your personal horoscope. Also important are the  angles (called &quot;aspects&quot;) which the lights and planets make with  respect to each other. All of these factors -- plus the astrological  &quot;houses&quot; -- are explained both simply and clearly in this  excellent introduction to serious astrology. If you want to go beyond  &quot;newspaper astrology&quot; this is the best book to start with.	2000-09-15

Eric Ambler may not have invented the novel of suspense and intrigue but  he certainly perfected it. Ambler's novels are analogous to Hitchcock's  movies in that they present a sustained atmosphere of suspense, tension,  and even fear with little explicit violence. Like Hitchcock, Ambler was  quite simply the best there was in his genre and no one currently on the  scene can seriously compete with either of these two masters.<br />State of  Siege is not one of Ambler's best book, but it is quite good nevertheless.  If you're looking for a good suspense novel and you don't require that it  be drenched in gore, give this one a try. I think you'll come back to  Ambler again and again.	2000-09-15

Karl Popper was one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century. In The Open Society and It's Enemies he presents not only the case for democracy (an open society) but also the case against tyranny (a closed society), no matter how benevolent any given tyranny purports to be. Popper also explains why many people are still attracted to tyranical forms of government -- whether fascist or communist. Such people prefer order to freedom. One of the paradoxes presented by Popper is that some degree of inefficiency is endemic to democracy, whereas highly-efficient government -- which many people think they want -- is almost invariably tyrannical. This book is a must read for everyone interested in maintaining individual freedom and understanding the threats which it constantly faces.	2000-09-12

In The Logic of Scientific Discovery Karl Popper presents his brilliant thesis that no amount of positive experimentatal results can prove a scientific theory to be correct but a single negative result can prove a theory to be wrong. According to Popper, science is not a collection of established laws but rather a system by which hypotheses are tested experimentally. If a hypothesis survives numerous rigorous experiments, it gains plausability -- but it can never be definitively proven to be completely correct. This view is discomforting to many scientists but, nevertheless, has become the dominant view in recent years. As a research scientist with 43 years experience, I welcome Popper's position that science is a vibrant process of continuing hypothesis and experimentation rather than a stagnant collection of unquestionable truths.	2000-09-12

Journey into Fear is one of the handful of novels that Eric Ambler wrote before Word War II. And, like A Coffin for Dimitrios, it is a classic. The protagonist is an English engineer returning from Turkey with valuable  knowledge. Axis forces are determined to prevent him from doing so. In  order to protect him, Turkish authorities have arranged for him to travel  on a cargo ship which carries a few passengers -- all of whom have  supposedly been investigated and found to be harmless. Imagine then the  terror he experiences when he discovers that one of the passengers is a man  who recently tried to kill him. Now the supposedly safe cargo ship has  become a trap from which escape seems impossible. His frenzied attempts to  save himself are twarted again and again. This is the sort of chilling  masterpiece that has made Ambler a legend.	1999-04-20

Many people who have heard of the legendary Eric Ambler think of him as a mystery writer, whereas he is actually a writer of novels of intrique and suspense. The exception is Epitaph for a Spy which, while amply full of  intrique and suspense, is also a mystery story -- the only true whodunit  that Ambler wrote. However it is a mystery story of great integrity with  none of the sleight-of-hand used by lesser authors to turn the least  plausible person in the book into the guilty party in the last chapter. If  you think of Ambler as a mystery writer, read Epitaph for a Spy and you  won't be disappointed. But you will probably want to read Ambler's other  intriguing novels as well, even if they are not mysteries per se.	1999-04-20

The introduction recounts the story of a German sergeant who deserts during the Franco-Prussian War and changes his name to conceal this desertion. Ambler  then takes us to modern times and the tortuous complications that this  seemingly-trivial event has on the search for the heir to an unclaimed  fortune. Along the way we encounter the many interesting vignettes and  insights into human behavior that typify Ambler's stories. If such  revelatory insights coupled with compelling twists and turns of plot are  more important to you than explicit sex and violence, then you too may find  Eric Ambler to be THE master of intrigue as well as one of the finest  novelists of this century in any genre. You may also decide, like I have,  that The Schirmer Inheritance may well be his masterpiece.	1998-12-08

This book is full of ramblings that present Wolfe's position that Eric Ambler is not the master of intrigue that he is widely-acknowledged to be but, rather, is a somewhat mediocre aspirant to such status. In my view  Wolfe largely misses the most important point of Ambler's books: they are  only superficially novels of intrigue. More fundamentally they are  expositions on human strength and frailty as well as human behavior,  especially under stress. That Ambler is able to explore such matters so  skillfully in the guise of highly-entertaining novels of suspense and  intrigue is a sign of genius not mediocrity.	1998-12-08
