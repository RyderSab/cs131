US	27769902	RSHLUHJNATOQ8	B0007247L4	529492806	The sex life of a Muslim (revised edition) #54	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Unabashed Muslim Sex Manual	\\"Sex Life of a Muslim\\" by As Sayyid Isa Al Haadi Al Mahdi (b.1945 A.D.)Paperback, first edition in 1977 (180 pgs?)& 1980 reprint, revised 1989 (324 pgs!), [\\"revised edition #54\\" from a set of numbered Islamic paperbacks -- not meaning 54 revisions of this one book]; English (with some Arabic phrases), printed in U.S.A., no named publisher, apparently NYC.  This is a Muslim's companion sex-aid manual to \\"The Joy of Sex.\\"  As the author noted: \\"Never before has any Islaamic Community attempted to publish a book which clearly explains the importance of sexual foreplay and intercourse in a male and female relationship to the average Muslim....Muslims in the East do not have any published pamphlets on sex, so whenever this topic is spoken about in their books it is always secretive....[Men] can't teach their wives how to enjoy sex.  This is why there is such an imbalancement in marriage, and frequent divorces.\\"  While few photographs are used, many sexually explicit drawings are shown, and numerous poor-quality photographs of sexual activities that are carved into stone in various temples in India are reproduced.  [This book's sub-title could have been \\"Erotic India Stone Carvings\\".]  While most westerners believe that Muslims are bashful in talking about sex, this Muslim author is not at all shy about promoting a healthy, active, safe-sex lifestyle for Muslims. Topics: Section 1: Anatomy of male sex organs, the penis, circumcision, seminal fluid, sperm concentration, breasts, clitoris, vagina, vaginal fluid, physiology of sex, physiology of an erection, the testes, sperm production, the male sexual process, female orgasms, the female sexual process (including drawings), an Islaamic household, sense of smell, internal bathing, massage techniques, erotic massage, seduction, precautions, masturbation, oral sex, techniques, vaginal sex (14 position are noted and/or shown ), anal sex, sexual aids, sexual hang-ups, & when children should be educated about sex.; Section 2: venereal disease (and explicit photographs), syphilis, aids, sodomy, surgical treatment, hermaphrodite, incest, bestiality, glossary.   In discussing sex, interestingly, this Muslim quotes not only from the Qur'an, but also from the Christian Bible and from the Jewish Torah.  This Muslim clearly opines that the Qur'an forbids homosexuality and bestiality, but he provides drawings as to how these sex acts are performed -- apparently to show Muslims what sex acts to avoid should the  jinni be watching.  The author provides MANY quotations from the Qur'an regarding sexual matters, along with transliterations (explanations) of the Arabic -- this adds some nice, unexpected Islamic \\"intellectualism\\" to this \\"hands on\\" sex-education manual.  Islamic calligraphy is admired for its flowing beauty, especially how sentences can be designed into artwork resembling structures; but one will be shocked how this author has used Islamic calligraphy and a mosque to develop some rather erotic Islamic phalic imagery.  This is probably the only Muslim book that depicts photographs of three safe-sex-travel kits: \\"her travel kit\\", \\"his travel kit\\", and \\"the Gay travel kit.\\" This author argues that the Muslim Allah (PBUH) does not prohibit anal sex (p.145). This book is really \\"all inclusive\\" in its sex-related topics (many of which I have not mentioned); it even provides anatomically correct drawings detailing: \\"The surgical treatment performed on a Pseudohermaphrodite.\\"  Definitely the foremost Muslim sex-education manual detailing how the Muhammadians are able to make Islam the \\"fastest growing religion.\\" <br />	2005-10-08

Despite its importance, this worldwide growth of extreme shari'a is under-documented and little understood.  Through a detailed comparative analysis of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, Sudan, Nigeria, Malaysia, and Indonesia, the contributors to this timely book document its terrible effects on human rights -- especially the status of women and religious freedom -- of Muslims as well as religious minorities, and of democracy itself.  This book also makes a compelling argument that such laws are a direct threat to the Western interest of advancing democracy and human rights.  Democratic nations and international human rights groups lack any meaningful policy for dealing with the spread of extreme shari'a.\\"  This book \\"concludes with policy recommendations for the United States regarding specific countries confronting extreme shari'a.  Contributors are: M. Barends: teaches law at the University of Leiden; H.F. Bella: was the director of the Sudan Human Rights Organization in Cairo; Mehrangis Kar: Iranian lawyer (Amnesty International names her a 'human rights hero' in 2002);  P. Marshall: senior fellow at Freedom House's Center for Religious Freedom; P.G. Riddell: professor of the Center for Islamic Studies at the London School of Theology, Brunel University; S. Schwartz: journalist; Nina Shea: former vice-chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom; R.J. Woolsey: former director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Provides specificly identified (numbered) Shari'a laws in seven major Muslim countries.  Written in a scholarly, well-researched manner; not in a \\"Bible thumper's\\" style so commonly seen from some religious institutions.	2005-09-12

This book was published in the early dark days of World War II (1942 second edition, hardback, Zondervan Pub.) when the dictatorial Axis Powers were at their apex in fighting the democratic Allied Nations (excluding the Soviet Union) -- although it may not have looked that positive to the Allies at that time.  From this book's forward: \\"The International Missionary Council appointed Dr. H. Kraemer, of Leyden University, to prepare a volume for the Madra meeting (1938) on the [Christian] evangelistic approach to the great non-Christian faiths, and to define the fundamental position of the Christian Church as a witness-bearing body in the modern world.....An emasculated Christianity has no power of propaganda and no missionary passion.  The present-day trend of theological thought, however, is away from yesterday's naturalism and relativism.  So we have tried in this little book...to weigh the overwhelming evidence for the genuineness of Christ's Great Commission and for the finality of His teaching.  Three chapters deal with the place of Jesus Christ in the Old and New Testaments; five chapters with the Great Commission, its authority and its implications; while the remaining chapters tell of apostolic aims, methods, dynamic, qualifications, message and call.\\"  <br />   The chapter subjects are: 1-The missionary background of the Old Testament and the Fullness of Time. 2-The Finality of Jesus. 3-The Universality of Jesus. 4-The authenticity and genuineness of the Great Commission. 5-The last twelve verses of the Gospel of Mark. 6-The Fivefold Commission. 7-The beginning at Jerusalem. 8-Israel in God's Program. 9-The Apostolic Aim and Goal. 10-Apostolic methods. 11-The apostolic dynamic. 12-Apostolic qualifications. 13-The apostolic message. 14-What constitutes a Call. <br />  A well written appeal for Christians to head the call to become a witness and to become an evangelicalist.  For those already familiar with the author, Samuel Zwemer, one knows that one is in for an always high-class, fine work of Biblical scholarship.  The author has written several books on his earlier evangelical activities within Muslim nations. <br />	2005-09-06

Goulding; Guildford, England, 1977 First Edition. (Second Printing due to corrections needed to the text, thanks due to Haj Muhammad Bagher Rasti. 146 pages.) Book dedicated to the Twelfth Imam.

Such a scrutiny and analysis is required for an accurate assessment of both the superiorities and the deficiencies of the West in its concepts on all life's affairs and problems, to isolate the main line of ideas, strip them of superficial prejudice and unreasoned attitudes, and so reach basic factual substance for evaluation and judgment (the author).

They interviewed many people, including David Ben-Gurion, Dr. Weizmann, the Grand Mufti, other Arab spokesmen, British officials and many, many others.  They met, they talked, they listened; then they met, talked and listened some more -- in many places, including kibbutzim in Palestine.  I imagine you can find the committee's official report in some U.S. government archive, but this book presents the insights of Mr. Crum, who (a liberal Republican) supported the birth of the State of Israel.  Not really very much intellectual \\"depth\\" of the many Israel-Palestine issues; pretty much superficial.  It seemed like Crum was just trying to get a grasp on the overall issue as to why the Jews and Arabs and British were fighting one another.  The author did observe: \\"Professor Hitti had admitted to us in Washington that the Moslem law requires Jews and Christians to recognize the superior status of the Moslems....The result of Arab nationalism today was to denationalize the Jews and break any connection they had with Jews elsewhere--particularly in Palestine.  At the same time, Arab nationalism did not permit the Jew to become assimilated in the Arab states....In Iraq, for example, Zionism was high treason.  Every Iraqi Jew's passport was stamped 'Invalid for Palestine.'.....Thu, everywhere the Jew in the Arab Middle East remains the eternal scapegoat.....The situation is made no happier by the imposition of the Arab boycott against Zionist products....The situation of the Jews of Yemen is perhaps the most lamentable.  Here Jews are, ipso facto, third- and fourth-class citizens.  They must get off a sidewalk and into the street when an Arab passes...They are forced to live in ghettos which are locked at night; yet they arenot legally permitted to leave Yemen.\\"  (p.240-242) A very insightful book for its time.	2005-08-27

A very well written and finely detailed account of the Arabs that the author met.  A sample of his writing: \\"I reached a section abround and about the Rue de la Galeche, Tangier's street of the maricones, notorious for its display of cavorting male harlots and degenerates, and unrestricted by law.  These perverts, practicing their unhappy mtier, seem to cater toa demand that is abnormally large.  The solidity of this business, carefully protected by doctrines of lassie-faire, rests upon the philosophical basis that whatever the eye does not see should not bother anyone....Tangier lays claim to this nightmare of male maricon belles, happy hunting ground of the Moor.  In the Rue de la Galeche and other streets, whole rowsof houses are chock-full of these dregs of humanity dressed in evening gowns, with painted lips and powdered faces, loitering before the doors of tiny cribs, inviting one and all filled with desire to enter their Valhalla.  By day a drab street, by night a garish, loud hotbed of Tangier's perverted amusement world.  All about, the womanless street was aswirl with bearded men in fez and burnoose.  Business was brisk and full of promise in the Rue de la Galeche.\\" (p156)    The author had a keen eye in noting the finer details of the lifestyles of the Arabs he met along the northern African coast. 244 pages of intimate detail.	2005-07-31

Chapters: 1-Arbia; 2-Early Years; 3-Allah and Mohammed; 4-A Prophet is not without Honor; 5-The Hegira; 6-Holy Wars; 7-Defeat of all Infidels; 8-Avocations; 9-The Triumphant Return; 10-Mohammed and Allah.  Dibble writes in a generally, neutral tone: noting the history of Mohammed -- as a Muslim would relate it.  This is not a history of Islam, only of Mohammed.  He mentions no sources, but his history seems to be of our  generic understanding of the life of Mohammed.  Dibble doesn't undertake any serious philosophical or theological analysis of Mohammed.  Dibble is not anti-West, but he notes the shortcomings of the Crusaders in their killing of many innocent people.  Probably a pretty well-written book during the early 1920s in English regarding Mohammed.   Dibble quotes extensively from the Koran, but provides no specific ayats -- for in that era there were no numerical notations for the Koran.  Dibble is well versed with the Koran.  Too bad Dibble didn't undertake any analysis of Mohammed's thought process; this is pretty much just a history book about Mohammed.  Probably a 4-star book when it was written (5-star if it would have had some analysis); but at least a 2-star today because of its long length. Roy F. Dibble (1887-1929) wrote during the 1920s.  He received his doctorate from Columbia Univeristy in 1921. He wrote several biographies in his \\"Strenuous Americans\\" series.  In 1928 he was an Assoc. Prof. of English at Hunter College in NYC.

Dutton & Co., USA, Library of Congress#57-11250; 343 pgs.  This is a c.1955 story of the \\"last Spring migration of a nomad Persian [Iran] tribe, led by an hereditary chief, Ghazan Khan, from the wintering grounds in Southern Iran to the high grasslands of the mountains. Ghazan has made this journey thirteen times in his thirty years, but the Iranian government had decreed that the free life of the Falqani nomads must cease and their leader be exiled.  Despite the decree, one hundred thousand men and women with their flocks and herds set out through mountainous country.  When they were returning to the winter grazing ground the nomads finally joined battle with the authorities, during which their leader, Ghazan, was sadly killed.\\"  The book contains several nice photographs of the nomads.  It is mainly written in an informal \\"conversational\\" style, whereby a dialogue occurs between various nomads and the author.  It is not written in a college, text-book style.  This does not detract from the book, just that a prospective reader should understand its travelogue-style of writing -- sort of a Reader's Digest style.  It details the anger and frustration of Ghazan's realization that the Iranian government is going to curb his tribe's nomadic lifestyle -- and how he plans to lead his people to a region where they may remain free from Tehran's control.  The tribe's trials and sorrowful tribulations experienced during their flight are recounted in this enjoyably easy-reading book.  One gets a deep \\"I am there\\" feeling in understanding the hardy life-styles of the men, women and children living in this proud, nomadic tribe -- just before it ends.	2005-07-21

Translation by: Mirza Ma'sum Beg; printed by: Ahmadiyyah Anjuman Isha'at Islam; in Lahore, Pakistan, 1968, medium-size paperback, 188 pages. Originally was written in the Urdu language in four volumes under the title of 'Barahin-i-Ahmadiyya' in 1880.  The author was born in 1835 at Qadian in northern Punjab, India.   From the \\"About the Author\\" section in this book, it opined: he established \\"the claims of Islam as the best religion for mankind; emphasized the necessity of Divine inspiration, argued that God spoke to His chosen ones even today as He did in the past; in this connection, he referred to his own visions and inspirations and mentioned the fulfillment of some of these. While writing this book it was revealed to him that he had been appointed the Reformer (mujaddid) of the fourteenth century of Hijra for defending the cause of Islam.  In 1891, he announced that it had been revealed to him that Jesus Christ was not alive, but had died like other prophets.  He declared that the Messiah...was to be a Reformer of the nation and that the prophecies had been fulfilled in his own person.....(E)ven with the Government keeping strict watch over him owing to is claim to be the Mahdi, he continued propagating Islam.\\"  (In 1901 he started an English monthly: The Review of Religions.)  Table of Contents: 1-The Prophet of Arabia; sublime morals, great contributions, Holy wars, prophecies fulfilled. 2-The Glory of the Quran: external & internal evidence, divine challenge, Quranic diction, law of nature, way to knowledge.  3-The Existence of God: salvation, atheism, divine revelation, rational faculty, human reason, eternal hereafter, atonement. 4-The Chief Attributes of God: 1st-4th graces (Rabubiyyat), worship, right path, favours, divine power.  Quotes: \\"The house of Israel was a wreck.  Jesus had come and gone without producing any effect upon the Jews.\\" ....\\"The Christians...had rendered their condition worse by falling from the practice of the teaching of the Gospel, and 'this was the reason -- adds a Christian missionary -- why God did not check Islam in its rise to power, since He desired at the time that they should be punished, because they had forsaken the teachings of the New Testament.'\\"....\\"One should not be misled by the idea that human reason is good.\\"(p.156).  [3 stars as this is a translation of the author's book; but only 3 because it really doesn't enhance Islam; and this guy is undoubtedly considered to be a heretic by Arab Muslims.]	2005-07-17

Published by: Institute of Islamic Culture. Printed in English at Zarren Art Press, Lahore, Pakistan.  Author: Bashir Ahmad Dar.  Sayyid Ahmad Kahn (1817-1890?). From the Introduction: After Ahmad Kahn returned to India from a trip to England [c.1870], Khan \\"was acutely aware of the dangers inherent in the spread of English education.  In one of his lectures he declared the he had never met a man who had got Western education and who did not entertain doubts about the different problems of religion....The contribution of Sayyid Ahmad to the development of religious thought of Islam can be evaluated only in the context of the situation that then obtained in India.  There were three different factors that were collectively working against the Muslims.  The first was the presence of the Christian missions which were fully supported by the British authorities.  Their press and platform were busy in attacking Islam and its founder.  In the whole history of Islam, it was the first occasion when the Muslims were reduced to the status of a subject people and as such had to face and stand against the attacks of Christian critics who now had the advantage of belonging to the ruling stock.  Having lost the political power and consequently the prestige, the Muslims needed great courage and conviction to defend themselves and their religion against these attacks.  The second was the aggressive trend of Hindu nationalism.  Taking advantage of the anti-Muslim policy of the English rulers, the Hindus had been able to gain an upper hand in almost all spheres of life....It was in this context that Sayyid Ahmad was forced to raise his voice against the so-called national demands of the Hindus thought the Indian National Congress.  The third factor was the psychological demoralization that had set in among the Muslims as a result of the failure of their movements for political liberation of the country and social reformation.\\" Ahmad Kahn \\"was much impressed, above all other things, by the principles of self-help displayed by the British people.  He remarked that in England almost everybody tried to do something for the common welfare, while in India people looked to the Government for the satisfaction of even their tiny needs.\\"  Ahmad Kahn favored peaceful co-existence between the three religions -- which was opposed by some Muslim imams, but he maintained that Islam was the one true religion. The author Dar reviews Ahmad Khan's pro-Islamic theology, but does not critique it. <br /> <br />	2005-07-17

Reda Bhacker looks at the role of Oman in the Indian Ocean prior to British domination of the region. Omani merchant communities played a crucial part in the development of commercial activity throughout the territories they held in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, especially between Muscat and Zanzibar, using long established trade networks. They were also largely responsible for the integration of the commerce of the Indian Ocean into the nascent global capitalist system. The author, himself a member of an important Omani merchant family, looks in detail at the complex relationship between the merchant community and Oman's rulers, first the Ya'ariba and then the Albusaidis. He analyses the tribal and religious dynamics of Omani politics both in Arabia, where he looks especially at the Wahhabi/Saudi threat, and in Oman's sprawling empire', with particular reference to Zanzibar where the Omani ruler Sa'id b Sultan had his court from 1840. His aim is to consider all Oman's overseas territories as a single entity, without the usual misleading compartmentalisation of African and Arab history. Dr Bhacker finds that despite their prestige and influence in the region neither the merchant communities nor the government were able to respond to Britain's determined onslaught. Bhacker traces the local and regional factors that allowed Britain to destroy Oman's largely commercial challenge and to emerge by the end of the nineteenth century as the commercially and politically dominant power in the region.	2005-07-15

Revell, New York, 437 pages, 41 b/w illustrations, w/1 fold-out map. 8 other maps and diagrams plus 4 appendices.  In the original preface to this scarce volume, the author admits that its main purpose is to call attention to Arabia and the need of missionary work for the Arabs. \\"The spiritual burden of Arabia is the Mohammedan religion and in its cradle we can best see the fruits of Islam. We have sought to trace the spiritual as well as the physical geography of Arabia by showing how Islam grew out of the earlier Judaism, Sabeanism and Christianity.\\" <br />The work is dedicated to: \\"The Student Volunteers of America\\" in memory of the two American volunteers who lay down their lives for Arabia.\\" The introduction by James S. Dennis describes the book as a missionary contribution to the knowledge of the world: \\"The author is entirely familiar with the literature of the subject. English, German, French and Dutch authorities are at his command. The less accessible Arabic authors are easily within his reach, and he brings from those mysterious gardens of spices into his clear, straightforward narrative, the local coloring and fragrance, as well as the indisputable witness of original medieval sources. The ethnological, geographical, archeological, commercial and political information of the descriptive chapters brings to our hands a valuable and readable summary of facts, in a form which is highly useful, and will be sure to quicken an intelligent interest in one of the great religious and international problems of our times.\\" The Appendices commence with a chronological table beginning with the birth and death of Ishmael and ending with, in 1886, the taking of Riyadh by Mohammed Ibn Rashid, overturning the Saud government and becoming ruler of Central Arabia. There follows a 'Table of the Arab Tribes of Northern Arabia', 'Kaat and Coffee Culture in Arabia', ending with an 11 page 'Arabian Bibliography', subdivided into Geography of Arabia (60 author's works); Manners and Customs (20 author's works); History of Arabia (48 author's works); Islam (180 author's works!); Christianity and Missions (6 author's works); Language and Literature (80 author's works). There is also an 8 page 'Table of Contents' in addition to an extensive Index, making this a reference work of immense value to students and the casual reader alike. Finally the author has reproduced a fold-out facsimile of the Meccan Certificate awarded to those who have completed the Hajj; \\"looked on by pilgrims as virtually a passport to heaven\\". <br /> <br />	2005-07-10

Within a century, that belief had created one of history's mightiest empires - and today Islam continues to shape events around the globe. This comprehensive guide offers an informative and insightful introduction to Islam both as a religion and as a political-economic force. It tells the story of Muhammad - and the rise of Islam; outlines the sacred book, the Koran; explains \\"the five pillars of faith\\"; explores the interplay between religion and government; describes the differences that divide Islam; and, above all, shows the influence of Islam on world affairs. This SECOND revised edition provides crucial new material on the Islamic community today, including discussion of the Gulf War and the Salman Rushdie affair; the rise and ebb of fundamentalist fervor in Iran, Algeria, and elsewhere; and the relationships among different factions of the Islamic faith. There are also updated descriptions of internal politics in Syria, Egypt, Pakistan, and other Islamic nations. Complete with glossary, bibliography. and index.	2005-07-07

This is a fascinating and comprehensive historical report on the Persian Gulf, illustrated with black and white plates and a sketch map and dealing with the early records of commerce dating back to 2000 BC, the important sheltered port of Sur, Albuquerque's control over the Portuguese, and much more. This report being a preface to his book published the following year, Wilson gives us a compelling geographical and historical overview of civilian life, Bahrain and the pearling industry, the Islam religion, and Christian missions, in a time of British presence and much change in Iraq. The author spent almost 18 years in the Persian Gulf and was one of the most important British civil servants in the Middle East. He served in consulates at Ahwaz and Khorramshahr from 1907-1914 and also worked for the Anglo Persian Oil Company. He has been described as a versatile, fearless and exceptionally gifted man who was at home in all walks of life, and in all circumstances. In January 1919, the British set up a military administration under Sir Arnold Wilson, and in April 1920 the League of Nations confirmed the British Mandate over the region. Wilson's rule, however, helped set the stage for Great Arab Revolt in 1920. Because of the major economic investments, British war-time policy in Iraq was very different from western Arabia where they overtly encouraged and aided the Arab Revolt. The British managed to suppress the revolt at great expense. Wilson was later replaced by Sir Percy Cox who was sympathetic to Arab aspirations. On the outbreak of the Second World War Sir Lt. Col. Arnold Wilson (who had served in parliament as MP for Hitchin since 1933) joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. An air gunner in Bomber Command, he was killed in action over northern France in 1940 shortly before publication of his second book: \\"S.W. Persia: Letters and Diary of a Young Political Officer 1907-1914\\" in 1941.  This report pre-dates Wilson's book published in 1928, entitled: \\"The Persian Gulf: An Historical Sketch from the earliest Times to the Beginning of the Twentieth Century.\\" A most incredible report on the ancient commerce of Persia, that shaped to a large extent the state of affairs in the tumultuous regions of the Middle East - Superb!!!	2005-06-29

Its author, Dr. Kaukab Siddique, a devout Muslim, used to be affiliated with the \\"American Society of Education and Religion\\" based in Maryland, USA.  The Table of Contents: Islam and social change; the meaning of exploitation explained through discussion of the food problem; Was Islam non-Revolutionary in Makka (Mecca)?; Islam's strength for the downtrodden and the oppressed; Its enemies are the powerful and the wealthy; Islam, Pakistan and the transfer of power; Muhammad forbade begging; Is centralized organization Islamic?; the essential antagonism of Islam and monarchy; Iran: Socio-economic implications of Islamic revolution; Equal division of wealth by Muhammad; land to the tiller; Pakistan; Islamic leadership & decentralization; the Example of 'Ayesha.  Dr. Siddique is a poorly educated  socialist: since there are poor people in capitalist countries, therefore socialism must be the solution for an Islamic nation -- but not communism.  The Quran is without contradiction.  Dr. Siddique is well versed with the Quran; he quotes from the Picthall translation.  He is opposed to monarchies, and while he supports a shariah-based government, he is opposed to the strict Mullaharchy-controlled government (such as Iran in 1980-2000).  He claims he supports a government elected by the masses, the public.  He criticizes the fundamentalist Islamists: \\"They do not realize that the blessed Prophet passed on from preaching and teaching to armed struggle\\"(pg.33) -- words he wrote in 1981 -- two decades before the Islamikazies flew airplanes into the New York City Twin Trade Towers.  He also wrote: \\"(Islamists) do not accept the unpleasant fact that unless the great masses of the poor are aroused from their sleep to set fire to this world of falsehood and degradation Islam will not become a living reality\\"...\\"The Quran calls attention again and again to theconfrontation between Moses and the tyrant Pharoah\\" (pg.33).  He supports a socialist-style form of farming: \\"Land ownership will be limited for the next 20 years to between 25 and 50 acres according to its productivity\\"  and \\"the middle-man will be eliminated and arrangements will be made for direct sale of produce by the producers\\" (pg.42)  and except for small home businesses \\"all industries and businesses will be nationalized\\" (pg.43) ....and Muhammad taught that \\"land ownership is based on tenantry, that is the person does not own the land but he works for somebody else, is not permitted.  A person who works the land owns the land.  There cannot be absentee landlordism\\" (pg.64).  This short booklet is worth reading to gain the insight of those socialist-oriented Muslims who believe that the downtrodden masses should elect their government leaders.  This book's backjacket notes that this book \\"begins where the existing books on Islam and economics, politics and society end\\" -- which is a very sad commentary about the usefulness of this book and Islamic ideas regarding economic theory.	2005-06-28

However, the author should have taken much more time in editing it, developing its themes, documenting or citing his remarks, and retained an editor who could have given this book a much-needed edit.  The author rambles around in presenting his topics, much of it is so disjointed in the presentation of subjects that one wonders how the author thought he was presenting a cogent book.  Shorroish is an Arab-Christian who was born in Nazareth, Palestine, and fled into Jordan in 1948 during the Israel War for Independence.  He became essentially a \\"born again Christian\\" and joined a Christian evangelical movement in Jordan, before moving to the U.S.   Shorrosh was about 70 years old when he wrote this book, and while lucid, the author while presenting one topic jumps to other themes and back without making much connection.  The author is fixated on the idea that he must prove that there are more Christians spread thoughout the world than there are Muslims; he should have just skipped this topic. Shorrosh notes that the Muslim Prophet Mohammad waged some 50-60 military campaigns in an attempt to \\"convert\\" Jews, Christians and pagan Bedouins to Islam about 630 A.D., but Shorrosh does not cite any source detailing Mohammad's military raids -- Shorrosh should have included such of a compilation as an appendix to his book, it would have made this paperback worthwhile to buy.  Shorrosh tries to show that Islam is anti-Christian and anti-Jew by quoting supporting suras from the Quran.  While he cites the suras, Shorrosh -- although well versed with the Bible -- doesn't really present any insightful or thoughtful analysis as to how or when the Quran suras were written and why they were revealed.  Shorrosh essentially writes that the Quran is false because the Bible is true.  Shorrosh has the habit oflisting the documentation of minor statistical data (such as populations of various Muslim countries), but he almost never provides any citation of other \\"comments/data\\" that he pulled out of newspapers or other books.  Not that Shorrosh has to \\"cite\\" a background source for every thing that he wrote about, its just that he provided some interesting tidbits that a reader would liked to have cited for further research.  This book is more of a polemical church sermon than an enlightening research work.  To give some background to Shorrosh's paperback, some topics he discusses are: The two faces of Islam - peace v. war; General Muhammad to conqueror; Is oil politics the supreme ruler in the world today; human rights in Islamic countries; Islam presents another God and a counterfeit God; Biblical sources of Islam; the U.S. \\"Nation of Islam\\" movement; America's false sense of security; the political invasion of American by Muslims; the heartbreaking Arab-Israeli conflict; a long listing of Muslim attacks upon Christians throughout the world between 1970-2000; and a review of Shorrosh's insights from his two tours of Iraq in 2004.  Unfortunately, Shorrosh presents a very disjointed perspective as to why the U.S. failed to find the missing \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" in Iraq; he should have just skipped this topic.  The author briefly mentions \\"The True Fuqan\\" that he helped author, but he fails to detail the relevance of this book -- one has to find it on the internet to learn anything about it (apparently, it is a totally revised 'Quran' re-written from a Christian perspective  - not a 'translation' but a total re-write to entice a Muslim to want to believe in the Bible.)  Buy this  book only if you want to help finance Shorrosh's evangelical Christian missionary work.  I found a couple of snippets of useful information.  But if you really want to learn more of an Arab's view of Islam from a well-reasoned perspective, I would suggest I.

It was produced by the \\"Missions Advanced Research and Communications Center\\" a ministry of \\"World Vision International.\\"  Usually one encounters a small booklet written by some Christian missionary who discusses his efforts in some small community for 25 or so years; usually, not much depth besides reproducing many quotations from the Bible.

A really boring book!  The author discusses his travels throughout the Middle East, but his observations are usually about the petty squabbles that he had with many village's poor &#34;hotel&#34; services, continuous complaints about his means of travel (whether by train or by horse), he had utter disdain for almost all of the common-folk that he meets, and just doesn't provide much if any depth about the political incidents that he encounters.  Some of his observations: * &#34;The rest of the Christians of Syria, living in villages, are generally a poor race of people, resembling degraded Fellaheen, but of worse morals and physique; indeed they are not worth a description, and are interesting only to archaeologist in ritual and early Christian sectarian controversy&#62;&#34; (p. 30) * &#34;The Turk is not, truth to tell, very brilliant as a rule, though  very apt in assuming Western cultivation....There are few Turks who would not lay down their lives for their country, there are fewer who would save it from internal decay....&#34; (p. 65) * &#34;It is also a fact that the Armenians have an extra-ordinary habit of running into danger without possessing the courage to face it....I have good reason to know that these wretches actually schemed to murder American missionaries, hoping America would declare war on the supposition that the Turks were the criminals.&#34; (p. 78)  The only redeeming value to this book is the author's maps that denote the locations of hundreds of little-known communities that he recorded during his travels -- possibly for the benefit of British military-intervention interest. Sadly, otherwise, just a really boring book of little insightful analysis.	2005-06-16

With his knowledge of Arabic he was able to have direct talks with many Muslim leaders and civilians.  He was always diligent in asking almost each individual as to why they disliked U.S. military personnel in liberating Iraq from Saddam, and why they wanted the U.S. military out of Iraq and quickly as possible.  He notes how the average Saudi's income has \\"shrunk by as much as three-quarters in one generation.\\"  Explained why Saudi's fear the U.S. presence there to control the Middle East and keep oil prices low (okay, sounds fairly reasonable, besides the pro-democracy pitch).  One Saudi holy man didn't want to talk to the author because he didn't want to \\"be defiled by direct contact with me.\\"  Trofimov noted how Saudi's don't like visitors, and journalists even less.  Saudi's like to know which Islamic \\"sect\\" you belong to.  He noted that Saudi officials don't like foreign businesses to have an \\"X\\" it their name, because it \\"looks too much like a Christian cross\\" (pg.8). Trofimov notes how Islamists dislike the Sufis.  The author notes how Hindu workers who live in Saudi cannot be cremated there because the practice is barred by the Sharia; so the Hindu corpse has to be shipped out (pg.13).  Non-Muslims cannot be buried in Saudi Arabia, because they would defile the land.  So some are buried in the semi-secret non-Muslim cemetery in Jeddah (p.14).  While women can't drive cars, they can drive small dune buggies at parks.  There are literally hundreds of these small, personal \\"snippets\\" that one doesn't read in U.S. newspapers; they alone are worth buying this book. The author notes how he traveled behind U.S. military forces that invaded Iraq; and the perils ofdriving unescorted by the military. The author discusses the road blocks, the aftermath of some of the suicide attacks, and being shot at.  This is not a history book on Arabia; this is really more of a \\"travel adventure\\" book -- but of your worst nightmare: in the Iraqi combat zone.  There are so many fine things to say about this book, written by an individual who \\"was there\\" during the liberation of Iraq, and one who witnessed the building frustration by some Iraqis to the American presence there.  Nor to be overlooked are the findings by Trofimov about how Muslims in the other Arab countries that he visited view the American adventure into Iraq.  Many, many personal anecdotes written by a reporter who got away from Baghdad's \\"Green Zone\\" to talk with the villagers.	2005-06-14

Author: \\"Victor Mordecai\\" which may be a pseudonym for a \\"Dennis Anilipkin(?)\\" of Jerusalem, Israel (based upon an autographed copy I posses).  The author noted in 1995: \\"For some reason, there is an agenda by the media to squelch any negative news item involving Moslems\\" (pg.7).  He acknowledges that he is an Israeli Jew who is working to promote Judeo-Christian cooperation with various American Christian groups to alert all that there is a growing Muslim threat against other religions. Chapter 1: Biblical basis of Judeo-Christian civilization; 2: A short history of Islam; 3: the role of the media; 4: One-world government allied with Islam; 5: Is Islam un-American?; 6: Israel's striving for peace in the middle east vs. fanatic Islam; 7: Israel's dilemma in returning territories; 8: Iran's nuclear capability, subversive activities in Europe and persecution of Christians; 9: Iranian persecution of its own Christian citizens; 10: Islamic persecution of Christians in the Holy Land; 11: Palestinian Authority: realities; 12: Israel's moral duty towards Christian south Lebanon; 13: Massacre victims mourned; 14: Algeria: Islamic fratricide; 15: Afghanistan: Another Islamic hell bordering on the ridiculous; 16: global conflicts within Ishmael - Islam; 17: The Islamic genocide in Africa; 18: Farakhan's swamp of hatred; 19: Testimony of a martyr-Rashad Khalifa.  Most of this paperback contains lengthy reprints of articles from various magazines to support the author's views.  This paperback has a rather \\"shotgun\\" approach to it:  lots of little news snippets being blasted about, but not much depth to any issue.  The author lets the news clippings stand on their own -- he doesn't really tie the loose clippings together.  Its like reading a collage of news articles; but outside of noting that the clippings highlight some \\"wrong\\" committed by some Muslim terrorists somewhere, the author doesn't harmonize them together to develop a thoughtful idea about the terrorists' actions.  The author has simply taken on too many subjects without presenting much insight as to why the terrorists are committing their particular activities in some country.  This paperback is almost primarily a reprint of the major terrorist-oriented newspaper clippings between 1995-early 1997. Numerous short articles about Muslims killing Jews and Christians in Indonesia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Pakistan, Kenya, etc. Despite its lack of insightful analysis, it is worthy of perusing through for some terrorist news from foreign sources (primarily Israeli).  The Israeli author is to be commended for attempting to highlight the real threat emerging from radical Islamikazes.  This paperback has a Paul Revere flavor to it:  \\"Wake up, Wake up, the Muslim terrorists are coming.\\"  Not much depth to the announcement, but the warning is clear.  Its not that this is a \\"bad\\" book, but due to its lack of scholarly and insightful writing (and no bibliography) it is understandable why this is a self-published paperback and written under a pseudonym.  This is one of those books whereby the author is given an \\"E\\" for effort. Informative for when it was written (c.1997), but just not polished.  Borrow it from a library to review before buying. \\"The Terror Timeline\\" by Paul Thompson is much, much, much more useful.	2005-06-05

It also provides reprints of short selections from early Islamic theologians. Chapter 1: Introduction: Ritual, Law, Theology, Sectarian movements, Islam interpretations.

[Hardback ISBN 1-890297-05-4; medium-size paperback ISBN 1-890297-06-2]  The author essentially presents the argument that: \\"Islam/Quran is wrong because the Bible is correct.\\"  Nonetheless, this is still an informative book written by a Christian missionary who served in Egypt where he taught at the Faith Mission Bible College in Cairo, and who earned degrees including M.A. and ThD. from the International Bible Institute and Seminary. Part 1 is 100 pages discussing the life of Mohammad. Part 2 contains another 130 pages on the topics of: The History of the Koran; the Koran is Not a Miracle; the Doctrine of Abrogation; the Koran is Not Divinely Inspired; Contributions of the Jinn; Discrepancies in the Koran, the Koran does not Satisfy Spiritual Needs of Mankind; the Koran teaches Polytheism; the Bible and the Koran.  Part 3 of 70 pages discusses: Islam is not a religion of peace; Islam is not a divine religion; Jihad; and Major differences between Christianity and Islam.  He provides a brief paragraph or two detailing the variations of Islam: Sunni, Shiites, Ismailis, Assassins, Wahhabis, Darawishes, Sufiis, Druzes, Ahmadiyya, Zaydis, Hanafite, Malikite, Shafiite, Hanbalite.  As the author reads Arabic, he quotes from numerous Arabic-language books regarding Islam.  It is not a \\"scholarly\\" writing-style work like Warraq's \\"Why I am Not a Muslim\\", but more of a \\"here is a quote from the Quran which is obviously refuted by a quote from the Bible because I am a Christian\\" style.  But it is a \\"good\\" analysis by Dr. Mikhail, in that he presents his Christian analysis in a non-flaming manner.  However, all too frequently, he isn't too strong in making an effective argument or ties his thought process together too well.  For instance, in discussing Islamic brutality, he wrote: \\"In 1995 the Sudanese Islamic government tried to assassinate President Hosny Mubarak of Egypt in Ethiopia.\\" (p.245)  That's it -- he doesn't tie in why the Sudanese government didn't like Pres. Mubarak, who is also a Muslim. Oh, oh: he also refers to Allah as the \\"moon god\\" -- this won't go over well with the Eastern academicians.  He is short on footnotes, but he does list a citation for quotations from the Quran, the hadith, the Bible, and some other books and a few magazine articles.  And, interestingly for a Christian book, Dr. Mikhail does provide numerous selections and citations from the hadith -- which provides some insight into Muslim thinking; so, because of this, its worth a fourth star.  Easy reading.  This book is more informative about Islam that what I have made it out to be; so I would rate it better than most similar Christian-oriented books reviewing Islam.  A book for us Bible thumpers, but Prof. John Esposito et al. won't be referencing it.	2005-05-23

The Growth of Islamic Extremism <br /> <br />From the Introduction: \\"After centuries of battles, Constantinople, the crown of the Christian Byzantine Empire, finally fell to the Turks in 1453. Seven years later, Islam's warriors invaded Mystras. The ruined churches still stand, scarred by the violence of that attack. In the narthex of the Church of St. Demetrius, the faces and especially the eyes of the saints and apostles are mutilated. Believing that power was in these icons, the conquerors rode their horses into the church and with their swords and spears gouged out the eyes and destroyed the faces of the Christian saints.\\"  <br />Worlds Apart  <br />....\\"While radical Islam is growing, it does not represent the majority of Muslims. Nevertheless, radical Islam gains attention because of its violence and because it is organized and vocal.\\" ....  <br />\\"We (the authors) believe that a battle for the hearts of Muslims is being fought on a global scale today, not only in Afghanistan and the nations of the Middle East, but in Indonesia, the Philippines, Central Asia, Africa, and now in Western Europe and North America. Extreme Islamists have targeted Jews, Christians, and moderate Muslims, who continue to suffer persecution at the hands of militant regimes. Failing to understand the Islamic world is failing to understand the twenty-first century.\\" <br />\\"Finally, much of the current American interest in Islam stems from the attacks on September 11, 2001, and is focused particularly on radical Islam. Consequently, we have devoted extra attention to the nature and roots of extremism. In doing so, we use the terms radical Islam, extremist Islam, and Islamists interchangeably to describe the practitioners of violence and their supporters. As you will see in the pages that follow, many moderate Muslims throughout the world suffer at the hands of radicals.\\" <br />	2005-05-21

Printed by Harvard University Press in Cambridge, Mass. USA.  Chapter topics: 1-Introduction; 2-Regional Variation in Islamic History; 3-The curve of conversion in Iran; 4-Conversion as a social process; 5-Development of Islamic society in Iran; 6-Curve of Muslim names; 7-Iraq; 8-Egypt and Tunisia; 9-Syria; 10-Spain; 11-Consequences of conversion.  This book discusses how non-Muslims in lands invaded by Muslim armies changed their non-Muslim names to Muslim names after they were subjugated.  The author uses some mathematical models in analyzing his materials, along with graphs that clearly portray during what time periods the name changes occurred.  The author noted in part: \\"...non-Arabs who converted to Islam were obliged to become mawali, that is, fictive members of Arab tribes.  Only thus could they obtain any social identity as Muslims. Yet being a mawla of an Arab tribe was fraught with disadvantages.  Mawalit were regarded as racially inferior by many Arabs because they did not truly share the pure blood lineage that was the focus of tribal honor and loyalty.  They were discriminated against in marriage, denied inclusion on the military payroll, and made to suffer revilement and social slights.\\"(p.41)  In summary the author opined: \\"The two important interpretative ideas that arise most strongly from the preceding chapters are, first, that conversion to Islam leads almost inevitably, after it has passed its halfway point, to the weakening or dissolution of centralized government; and second, that the conversion process in and of itself gives rise to a clash of interest between elements of the population that convert at different periods of time.\\"(p.129)  This book is not for the student who is trying to figure out \\"What is Islam?\\", but it should be of interest to those scholars who might be interested in learning more about how quickly or gradualy non-Muslims converted to Islamic names (after their lands were invaded) to enhance their economic or social standings.  The author also discusses the religious disruptions that these name changes made  -- -- and the impact of Islam upon the locals in revising their social, religious and legal norms -- and vice versa how local customs (such as the Iranian  Umayyad period) influenced the development of Islamic customs.    \\"What built the Muslim community as a distinct and historically visible social entity was social conversion.  It was also social rather than formal conversion that created pressures for change witch affected the course of Islamic religious development.\\"(p.37)  \\"The second obvious observation is that non-Muslim revolts die out as the middle point in the conversion process is reached....(T)he pool of potential recruits to such movements had dwindled to nothing....(O)ne can see the turnover point between revolution against Islam and revolution within Islam.\\" (p.44-45)    The author reviews how Islam invaders, by ruling from with a city, developed new legal codes; and those who were conquered, if they wanted to achieve political power, converted quickly to learn Arabic and Islam -- whereas the farmers were slower to convert as they had no immediate need for learning Islam.(p.59)  \\"Taken together...three indirect consequences of conversion indicate that the true central thread of Islamic history lies not in the political realm of the caliphs and sultans but in the social realm where the ulama served as the functioning heart of the historic Muslim community.\\" (p.138)	2005-05-11

Written by a retired British major, who served in the English army throughout Egypt and the Middle East.  It is a light-hearted work, written for an enjoyable romp through the major's military experiences, primarily in Egypt during the 1930s.  He reviews his meetings with various Egyptian nobility, shahs, a couple of kings, British royal visitors, British military commanders, British politicians junketing through, numerous lackadaisical Egyptian civil servants, and the small farmers and shopkeepers.  Some discussion of the politics within Egypt as the British tried to rule the semi-independent country.  One of his jobs was to track down the occasional bandit roaming amongst the sand dunes.  Really of hodgepod of serious, funny and silly experiences, but they all make for an enjoyable, easy read -- to see the \\"proper\\" British view of exalted life amongst the poor, downtrodden Egyptian laborer.  A look at the \\"simple\\" life of the almost non-educated Egyptian farmers, who fear repairing water pumps because of thier Muslim religion they believe \\"spirits\\" inhabit them to make them work. Includes his musings regarding Christian missionaries who are befuddled as to why they cannot convert the deeply devote Muslims to Christianity. Some chapters: High Commissionsers: Lord Lloyd & Mohammed Pasha; Arab sheikhs at coffee; Sheikhs of the Bayyadin tribe; a Desert Dinner Party; Friq Peake Pasha of Jordan; the Wafd; Election Days; Bandits, Brigands and Bad Men; Ramada; the Arab and His Pipe. Not a travel guide, not a serious work, not a scholarly work -- but a nice light romp reading for two or three evenings in looking at Egypt during the 1930s.	2005-05-03

Review: \\"Karen Armstrong's thought-provoking biography offers a picture of Muhammad which facilitates a profound understanding of Islam and the people who adhere to it so strongly. While discussing Muhammad's life and the fragile society of seventh-century Arabia, she takes particular events as a focus for exploring major tenets of the faith. In dealing with Muhammad's war against Mecca, she asks how far Islam should be considered a religion of the sword; in describing his relationships with his wives, daughters and female converts she considers the claims that Islam is a fiercely misogynistic religion; and while analysing his major political achievements in uniting the tribes of Arabia she explores the reasons why Muslims regard political activity as a religious duty. At the same time she asks why Muslims tend to see worldly success as a sign of God's blessing while Christians sanctify the notion of poverty and humility. Unlike other Western biographers of Muhammad, Karen Armstrong takes as her starting point the reality of his religious experience, thereby illuminating Islam's powerfully inspirational nature and offering challenging comparisons with the two religions most closely related to it - Judaism and Christianity.\\"	2005-04-23

That is one of the problems of buying a book unseen.  (Apparently the book's author had some photographs from his travel through Islamic countries and needed to provide some text, and this booklet followed in a series of similar photo booklets regarding other religions.)  The author wrote: \\"The original Muslim mission...began circa 610 and ended in June 632\\"(p.2).  The reader is left wondering: What happened: did some government program run out of funds?  The relevant sentence should have been written: \\"The original Muslim mission...began circa 610 when Mohammad began to receive spiritual visits from the angle Gabriel and ended with Mohammad's death in June 632.\\"   I had hoped that this booklet would have been more informative.  The author wrote: \\"(T)he names of the first four Caliphs, called the 'Properly Guided Caliphs'...,because they, too, are models of virture, are held in very high esteem....\\"(p.19).  What the author apparently doesn't realize is that they are called the 'Properly Guided Caliphs' because out of all of the Muslim caliphs, they were the only four to have known Mohammad and thereby studied his teachings first hand.  The author fairly well describes the prayer ritual (riqa), but omits some details (such as towards the conclusion, the prayerful look both right and left and wish the adjacent person well).  The author notes that \\"When dressing...Muslims favour long white tunics...\\" but doesn't explain why:  because Mohammad in the hadith had voiced his preference for white clothing, and dictated bulky or shapeless clothing for women so that they become almost unnoticeable to men -- and therefore wouldn't prompt men to lose all self-control and ravish women wearing tight-fitting dresses.  The author claims that \\"green\\" was the preferred color of Mohammad, but doesn't cite a source of his claim.  During a Muslim's pilgrimage (al Hajj) to Mecca, the author notes that the pilgrims wear only white sheets for clothing, but is apparently unaware that after the pilgrimage Muslim keep these sacred sheets to be buried in. The author notes that pilgrims kiss or touch the \\"Black Stone\\" that is embedded in a corner of the Kaaba building, but doesn't note they do so in their belief that the stone sucks out evil traits from the pilgrim.  The author notes he had some Muslims review the book for their insights; too bad he didn't ask many more.  This booklet has small print, only about 50 photographs, really is not a serious research tome regarding Muslim symbols -- some text to go along with his photos.  Read it at your library (if you are already there), but I'd recommend instead: \\"Understanding Islam and Muslim Traditions\\" by Tanya Gulevich.	2005-04-09

Even if you have read \\"The Koran for Dummies\\" or \\"Understanding Everything About Islam\\" or the \\"Idiot's Guide to Islam\\", etc.,  this hardback-book's 496 pages still plows new grounds -- a true \\"keeper.\\"  (Hopefully some day its publisher will list the book's table of contents for your review.)  It covers just about everything of interest regarding Mohammad (pbuh) and Islam, its religious practices, its history, and what I found of particular value: its customs (in many Islamic countries); such as \\"greetings and sayings\\" (shake hands, kiss or nod), \\"clothing and adornment\\", \\"Beliefs and Practices Concerning the Body\\" (hair, cleanliness), \\"the Evil Eye, Amulets, and Charms\\", \\"the Life Cycle and Conversion\\" (male & female circumcision, puberty, marriage, death), \\"symbols\\" (moon, Kaba), \\"animals\\", \\"dance\\", the numerous holidays or days of observance, the saints and their festivals, a nice bibliography that is broken down by chapter topics (rather than all just combined aphabetically as is typically done), and a list of websites.  Not a whole lot of depth (most topics discussed within one page), but very expansive in the number of topics and subjects.  Nothing here really about militant-jihad or extreme \\"fundamentalism\\", and it overlooks the \\"controversial\\" anti-Jewish or anti-Christian and pro-slavery stuff as revealed by Allah (rst) in the Quran (see Ibn Warraq books for that).  While it has many nice photographs relevant to its topics, it's not like a typical \\"photo book\\" of Islamic stuff.  Heavy on social customs, but not really controversial nor a skeptical or analytical look at Islam. Suited for a college-level class introductory book on Islam, but easily understood for high-school use also.	2005-04-05

Her writings seem to reflect the Palestinian world in the 1950s-early 1980s.  Although the author is of a Christian background, I didn't get the feel of any anti-Islam views; but then, no \\"critical analysis\\" of Islam, either.  A \\"pleasant\\" book to read, useful for general \\"background\\" views on Islam.  Sort of a \\"here are 'snippets' as to how Muslims view various aspects of Islam.\\"  Light and fluffy; just no depth; one had hoped for something much more informative from someone who had grown up in Palestine.  So much potential promise.  The book reminds me of a scene of actor Marlon Brando when he played the role of a faiding boxer: \\"I could have been a contender\\"....but.	2005-03-14

Sullivan and Jacqueline S. Ismael.  This book discusses key paradigms which have dominated the study of the Arab world from three perspective: those paradigms that have dominated the West's thinking about the Middle East in general; those paradigms used by indigenous scholars who study the region, and finally, the paradigms which have dominated and continue to dominate selected fields of study within the social sciences.  <br />Part One, \\"Neo-Orientalism and the Study of Islam,\\" addresses issues central to the debate about the \\"proper\\" study of Arabs in Islam. Part Two, \\"Methodological Perspectives on the Study of the Arab World,\\" contains articles by a sociologist and four anthropologists. Part Three, \\"Special Topics in Arab Studies,\\" contains essays in urban studies, women's studies, economics and economic policy, and the study of foreign policy, and closes with two essays on strategic studies. The book brings together some of the foremost scholars in the various fields of Middle East studies to critically examine the nature and quality of scholarship on the region. The chapters employ a variety of methods to expose the inadequacies of new and traditional approaches in the social sciences. It also has a clear interdisciplinary flavor, in that contributors include senior scholars, as well as several just beginning their careers, in Comparative Literature Religious Studies, Anthropology, Sociology, Economics, and Political Science.  <br /> <br />	2005-03-14

Al-Dhahabi wrote this book about 700 years after the death of the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH).  Besides listing each sin (al-Kabar) of Islam in a hierarchical order, specific references regarding these sins are made to citations from not only the Quran, but also from other Muslim scholars, such as Bukkari, Tirmidhi, Munabbeh, Muslim, and many, many others.  70 major sins are noted, so about three pages are used to analyze each sin (3 pages in English and a corresponding 3 pages in Arabic). Following are the top 15 major sins, in order: associating others with Allah (shirk), murder, practicing magic, not praying, not paying zakat, not fasting on a day of Ramadan, not performing the hajj, disrespect to parents, abandoning relatives, fornication (zina), homosexuality (sodomy), interest (riba), wrongfully consuming property of an orphan, lying about allah and his messenger, and running away from the battlefield.  Besides listing the sins, Al-Dhahabi explains why the action is a sin, and what the punishment for the violator should be.	2005-03-12

I had hoped that this monograph might be informative. I was hoping for a 4/5-star booklet; but the system won't let me rate this below a 1-star.   Save your money -- its 20 pages of text notes: some Muslims have difficulty understanding the Trinity and Christianity, some Christians have difficulty understanding the Koran, the Hadith and Islam. Fundamentalist Christians don't want to understand Islam, fundamentalist Muslims don't want to understand Christianity.  Muslims wonder why Christianity has split so much, and so frequently. Christians wonder why Sunni and Shiite are split.  But if we get together and discuss the issues, then we will have gotten together to discuss the issues (the author does not discuss them here). Jerusalem is important to all religions, but the author doesn't explain what or why. Nothing is insurmountable between everyone, if we talk about issues that are not detailed here. Everyone talks abut the \\"Freedom of Religion\\" -- but not much discussion here.  Oh, yes, \\"moderization\\" is making an impact on all religions; but, of course, how or why is not detailed here.  Very few specifics, this monograph resulted from a speech of his. So if you want something of substance, anaylsis and detail, buy one of the author's other books -- or anyone else's book for that matter.	2005-03-04

All discuss the \\"Dome of the Rock\\" or the \\"Al-Haram al-Sharif\\" hilltop in Jerusalem. [Atop this rock is where Jews believe their now-destroyed Second Temple was located; where Christians await the building of the Third Temple to enhance the return of Jesus; and is from where the Muslim Prophet Mohammad ascended into Heaven to talk with Allah before returning upon his flying-horse al-Buraq to Medina.] #1 (Sept. 1996): \\"The Dome of the Rock\\" by Said Nuseibeh AND Oleg Grabar. [Nuseibeh was the photographer, translator and writer, with co-author Grabar adding valuable commentary regarding the architecture of the dome.]  It is the large \\"coffee table\\" size: 9.6\\"x12\\", hardback with 175 pages; Rizzoli publisher; {ISBN-10: 08-47819426} $60 new, $35 used. This book provides countless photographs of every ornately tiled wall and crook-and-cranny niche within this octagon-shaped building, and is the first one that I have seen that translates the extensive Arabic inscriptions contained inside the dome. How should Christians view this inscription in the Dome: \\"So believe in God and all the messengers, And stop talking about a Trinity. Cease in your own best interests! Verily God is the God of unity. Lord Almighty! That God would beget a child? Either in the Heavens or on the Earth?\\" (p.107) [Muslims don't believe in the concept of the Christian \\"Holy Trinity\\"; and maintain that while Jesus was  actually a MUSLIM prophet, he was not the \\"son\\" of God and therefore not divine.] Also, this is the only book I've found that has a very detailed bird's-eye view of the top of the entire Haram al-Sharif complex, and depicts where about 65 different shrines, stairs, gates, and domes are located. #2 (Jan. 1997): \\"Le Dome du Rocher\\" by Said Nuseibeh and Oleg Grabar; hardback same as #1 but in French.  #3 (Oct. 2006): \\"The Dome of the Rock\\" by only Oleg Grabar.  It is medium-size: 6\\"x8\\", hardback with 234 pages; specialty Belknop Press of Harvard University Press; Cambridge, Mass.; printed in Canada; {ISBN-10: 0-674-02313-7} $25 new; $13 used.  This is NOT a smaller reprint of #1; it is a totally different re-write! It has perhaps only 5% of the photographs contained in #1, but does provide several new site maps along with new analysis. #4 (Aug. 1985): \\"Dome of the Rock\\" (in 'Wonders of Man' series) by Jerry Landay; 160 pgs; Newsweek Books {ISBN-10: 0882250183 or 088225019-1}.  As  related items you should review: (a) \\"Secrets of Jerusalem's Temple Mount\\" by Leen Ritmeyer {ISBN-10:188-031-752-4}; a study of the architectural history of the building of various temples atop the Temple Mount; and (b) \\"The End of Days\\" by Gershom Gorenberg {ISBN-10: 0-684-87179-3}; an analysis of the religious and political struggles between Jews, Christians and Muslims for control of the Temple Mount to accelerate the much-anticipated coming of the calamitous hells-a-poppin \\"End of Times.\\"	2005-02-22

Surprisingly, there a just a couple of photos of the Dome itself; not that many photos of the interior of the Dome, nor of the overall Temple Mount.

Starting with the Prophet Mohammad's (PBUH) birth it notes some Islamic-related event occuring each year up through 2002.  Earlier years have less events noted than later years.  Islamic events covered occur throughout the Middle East, Africa and Asia.  Not only are Islamic religious events noted, but so are other Islamic-related subjects: politics, all types of Muslim personalities, countries, women, military campaigns, coups, Balkan Wars, Copts, etc. Not a whole lot of \\"depth\\" to any subject; but at least besides noting that some event happened it provides a brief one-sentence \\"why\\" some Muslim leader did what he did. Its a small paperback, about the size of your hand; but a good inch thick!  (This is nothing like Esposito's \\"The Oxford History of Islam\\" which provides extensive chapters on specific subjects.)  At first I thought that there was simply toooo much mind-bogling history of Islam covered in this paperback, but that is exactly was makes it so useful with its 1,400 \\"snippets\\" of Islamic history.  Lots and lots of Islamic trivia data for a few dollars.	2005-02-21

If there is a shortcoming to this dictionary, it fails to allow the strident \\"intensity of belief\\" flavor of the militant Palestinian perspective to come through. But then this is a dictionary, not a passionate political tract.

(b) Regarding its \\"Arab-Israel War (1948)\\" article it notes that Palestinians objected to the creation of the state of Israel because they considered it a \\"violation of their right to self-determination.\\"  Okay, that is a Western \\"politically correct\\" statement; too bad they didn't give the true reason: that Muslims know that Muhammad expelled the Jews from the Arabia region and therefore no independent  Jewish state can be birthed from Muslim territory.  (c)  Regarding its article on Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, while it notes that \\"His visit to the Temple Mount...in September 2000 sparked Muslim riots\\", it fails to give \\"why\\" the Jew wanted to cross the road: Sharon believed that the 1948 cease-fire guaranteed that Jews could visit the Temple Mount, and so he requested and obtained approval from the Palestinian Authority prior to his stroll (Bodansky, \\"The High Cost of Peace,\\" p.353-4). But, this is a dictionary, not an encyclopedia.  There are few photographs; you get your money's worth in the well-written words.

Other reviewers have noted the contents of this book; the only one I wish to comment upon is the discussion about why Muslims are so rattled about the Chrisitian notion of \\"The Trinity\\": God, the Holy Spirit and Jesus.  I've found this short work to be great in explaining why Muslims find the notion of \\"The Trinity\\" to be blasphemous.  I won't analyze the reasoning here, but the authors' short chapter on this matter really hightened my understanding.  And the discussion of their differences pertaining to \\"Original Sin\\" is fine, too. This is a \\"good\\" book on a few topics, but alas, so short on small-sized pages.  Due to the shortage of words and pages, try to buy it as cheaply as you can.  1-star for its small size, but 3-stars for its helpful analysis.

It covers the main tenants of Islam, how Muslims should lead their lives; some history of Muhammad; how Allah needs to be worshiped; discusses some hadith; details a Muslim's view of the \\"hereafter\\"; and notes how that while Islam rejects the Bible -- Muslims (supposedly) honor Jesus.  This large-format paperback book is similar to the \\"Everything Koran Book\\", but not as interesting.  An appendix lists several Muslim organizations in each U.S. state.  Another index provides a very brief two-sentence synopsis of each sura/chapter in the Koran (much like the Ali translation of the Koran). This book will help a high schooler write a passing term paper on Islam. Costing only about 5 cents per page, its worth having to see how a Muslim views Islam.  It notes the difference between \\"iman\\" (faith), \\"imam\\" (a teacher) versus an \\"Imam\\" (to the Shi'as -- a set of traditions).  Muslims will like this book as there is little critical questioning of the doctrines of Islam. It presents more of the Westernized, liberal view of Islam; it does not present the traditional \\"fundamentalist\\" or Wahhabi-Islamic view of the Koran. It briefly discusses the legal rights of women to men. The authors ask the question: \\"Is the [Islamic] system fair?\\" and in answer to their own question they reply: \\"Perhaps the best answer to this question is not to be found by reading a book like this....\\" (p.150).

It makes for very easy reading in just several hours.  There is more breadth to this book than there is depth-of-analysis.  Teenagers will find enough substance for a good school report, but adults already familiar with Islam will most likely want to keep their sales receipt for return.  It lists: Pillars of Muslim Faith; Family Values; Women's Rights(?); Four Wives; Forbidden Foods; Sexuality; Judgment Day; the Soul's Journey; Gates of Heaven/Hell; The Jinn; Koranic Science (?); comparisions with the Bible; some brief analysis of Predestiny; how Muslims view Jesus; Muhammad's miracles; charity; the power of Satan verus Allah; and much more.  It presents the \\"upbeat\\" views of Allah's Koran, such as noting: \\"There is no compulsion in religion\\" but fails to note the embarrassing sections, as when Allah changed Jews into apes and pigs (sura 5.63); and fails to note what suras really stimulate the suicide martyrs to seek those dark-eyed virgins (houris) serving Allah in Paradise.  The author uses a handful of citations to her topics in the Koran, but the real serious shortfall of this book is its total lack of citation to the many Islamic traditions or hadiths that she also refers to.  One is left wondering if the author is quoting actual hadith, or just jumbling together a lot of Islamic hearsay.  After all the energy that the author put into developing this book, had the author listed her citations one would be interested in keeping this book.  She notes the difference between similarly sounding stuff: Imam (elite scholar) verus an Iman (faith).  While the author is upbeat about the sterling qualities of her male-dominated Islamic faith, despite dozens of Islamic nations, she lamments: \\"There is no ideal Islamic society in the world today\\"(p.74).  Fortunately for this female Muslim author, she lives in the more female-endearing UAE, instead of just west across the sand dunes in Saudi Arabia, where the imams impose the anti-feminist and anti-Semetic Koranic verses that she has chosen to overlook in her book.  The author is pragmatic about polygamy: we Muslims \\"believe Allah permitted polygamy for all times because there would always be a need for it.\\"  It is an interesting book to see Islam from an enlightened, but believing-female Muslim's view -- although Western feminists would not be tolerable of the Koran's stipulation that a minimum of four witnesses are needed to convict a man of rape. A barely better introduction book would be \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to The Koran\\"; but whereas the \\"Idiot's Guide\\" discusses Muhammad's uncle Abu Talib being sent to Hell, the \\"Everything Koran\\" book goes more into detail by noting that Abu's punishment in Hell will be \\"standing on hot coal with bare feet\\" -- Ouch! At 5 cents a page, \\"Everything Koran\\" is an okay large-format paperback book, but a lot of \\"everything\\" about the Koran isn't here.  A better citical-analysis book is Warraq's \\"Why I Am Not a Muslim.\\"	2005-01-08

Adm. Ruge joined Rommel's staff in November 1943 and provided advice regarding how to construct beach barriers that would prevent Allied landing craft from coming ashore along the Normany beaches.  Adm. Ruge met almost daily with Rommel to provide a naval perspective as to how he thought the Allies naval tactics would be used along the Normandy coast, and how they would attempt to land.  He continued to advise Rommel during the June D-Day landings, and saw Rommel up until just a few days before Rommel was asked to commit suicide -- after plotting against Hitler.  As the author notes, while the book is not a comprehensive description of the actual invasion, it provides the rare insight of the German naval offier who advised the \\"Desert Fox\\" about the sea -- 250 pages of \\"I was there\\" perspectives.  The book is enjoyable to read; it is neither ponderous nor tedious.  Ruge provides almost a daily view as to how he and Rommel prepared for the Allied invasion -- what types of beach barriers were constructed, where various weapons were to be emplaced, and how various military units were situated along the beaches.  I wrote to the author back in 1968, and he was kind enough to send me his autographed photograph and a few comments about his naval career.  His comments reflected his book: they made for an enjoyable read.  Ruge wrote several other naval-theme books about WWII, also.  (...)	2004-12-30

The author was a Japanese fighter pilot during World War II.  He shot down 16 Allied airplanes.  He details how he joined the Japanese naval air force in 1943, recounts how he shot down various Allied planes -- including his downing of the U.S. Navy's top air ace: \\"Pappy\\" Boyington -- and how he met Boyington after the war.  As Boyington's air unit was known as the \\"Bah Bah Black Sheep\\" squadron, Kawato impishly titled his book: \\"Bye Bye Black Sheep.\\"  Kawato describes how he was finally shot down, swam to shore, and captured by the Australians.  After the war he joined the Japan Self-Defense Air Force.  I met him in 1991 in Seattle, and he was gracious in autographing a copy of his book for me.	2004-12-30

Hence, from his planning of various German naval operations during World War II and then as an intelligence officer researching the Soviet navy during the 1950s, Ruge has the expertise to write on this matter.  As the naval attache to Fieldmarshall Rommel, Ruge presented his ideas to Rommel as to how to stymie Allied ships before they landed at Normandy in June 1944. He writes about the Soviet naval ops in the Baltic, in the Black Sea, and in the Northern Theater.  He details the operations, dates and discusses specific Soviet submarines and their successes and failures against German convoys and other Axis shipping.  Briefly, Ruge discusses how American \\"Lend Lease\\" ships to the Russians influenced the Russian fleet.  He discusses the effectiveness of Soviet air-attack techniques against German ships.  He laments the many failures of the Germans in protecting their ships that attempted to evacuate German civilians who were fleeing from Soviet forces late in the war. As in his letters to me during the late 1960s, Ruge's book is a rather \\"dry\\" presentation of the strategic issues and ship data, with few comments as to how individuals experienced the various naval engagements.  This book presents the German naval view of the limitations of the Soviet fleet during World War II.	2004-12-22

Instead, this book is Ritmeyer's archeological analysis of the construction and remodelings of the Temple Mount.  From that perspective, this short, small paperback booklet is a very informative analysis as to the various peoples who worked in developing the Temple Mount over several centuries (Jews, Romans, Muslims, Seleucids, Turks).  There are numerous photographs that are very helpful in noting the various construction differences, and location maps showing how the Temple Mount and the Muslim Platform were laid out, and nice 3D drawings depicting how the Jewish Temples might have looked -- based upon the stone foundations.  Also of interest is some detailing as to how the buildings were constructed; how different stones were used during different periods.  Some nice history is presented by explaining the excavations occuring during the 1880s. Ritmeyer's analysis is great, but his claiming that he can show where the \\"Ark\\" itself rested does require more \\"faith\\" than what he provides as \\"proof.\\" Only 116 paperback pages of text, but each one is very informative, from an archeologist's perspective.	2004-10-03

Its value lies with its reprinting numerous examples of long-forgotten anti-Red movie-posters and weird Red-baiting \\"pulp\\" magazines and articles.  Conservatives will be initially disappointed in that it \\"puts down\\" the sillier anti-commie publications, and it doesn't lambast the Red Menace; but, hey, it's a fun pub that conservatives should have a copy for research.

It provides a strict &quot;Question &amp; Answer&quot; format.  Little snippets of interesting trivia; but many of the answers are too short -- it provides the &quot;fact&quot; but misses in analyzing the importance of the &quot;fact.&quot;  It reviews how various U.S. military leaders dismissed the &quot;crazy&quot; idea that the Japanese were capable of attacking the U.S. fleet based at Pearl Harbor; all too many officers thought that the Japanese simply couldn't plan and carry out such of a hair-brain idea.  It reveals that the U.S. defenders thought they were far-better prepared in repulsing any surprise Japanese attack than what they actually were.  It notes how U.S. destroyers discovered midget Japanese submarines before the attack, how the Army's radar tracked the in-coming Japanese aircraft, and it reveals how there seemed to be no real serious coordination as to how these incidents were to be analyzed and reported to higher commanders for their alerting our defenses in a timely manner.  It presents a list of the U.S. warships based at Pearl, and lists the names of the attacking Japanese warships.

Besides presenting an almost \\"minute by minute\\" chronology of the attack, it advances several months ahead of Dec 7 in presenting various surveys and defense-planning conferences that noted the weaknesses of Pearl's defenses.  It quotes Pearl's two main defenders ADM Kimmel (Navy) and GEN Short (Army) as to how well they thought they were ready to defend Pearl from unexpected attacks.  Sadley, while these defenders were aware of their weaknesses, they seemed to do little to remedy the weaknesses, and seemed to fail to plan any effective drills to coordinate all their \\"alert\\" plans.  This book is not meant to be any serious study of the battle; instead, it educates through 240 pages of trivia \\"snippets.\\" It lists all major U.S. & Japanese ships involved in the attack. It details where the attacking Japanese warships (and their commanders) were sunk in later battles. It has FDR's full \\"Date which will live in infamy\\" speech. Lists all the names of those killed aboard the USS Arizona.  Lists other WWII trivia, such as the top 50  fighter \\"aces\\" of WWII, names the fastest fighter planes, and the largest and heaviest tanks.  Lists the current stateside bearthing sites of numerous WWII battleships. It has short biographies of the major participants in the battle, both U.S. and Japanese.  It discusses the various \\"bomb plot\\" messages, and how some of the many important messages regarding the Japanese military's interest in the defenses of Pearl Harbor were not given to ADM Kimmel.  It reveals how the U.S. was able to \\"break\\" and read the secret, coded Japanese political-messages being sent from Tokyo to its embassy in Washington, D.C.

He provides a most harrowing description -- as commander of cruiser Yahagi -- how he barely survied its sinking alongside the ill-fated battleship Yamato on their suicide mission to attack the U.S. forces invaiding Okinawa. He details his training of the pilots of suicide motorboats (Shinyo: \\"ocean shaker\\") that were designed to ram Allied warships approaching Japan.

Both editions contain the reprinted facsimile autographs and photographs of over 400 worldwide military officers and politicians, who also wrote a brief paragraph explaining why they believe Admiral Doenitz (Donitz) should NOT have been convicted of the WWII &quot;war crimes&quot; counts levied against him during the 1946 Nuremberg War Criminal trials.  There are many very interesting and surprising writings from Allied navy admirals and army generals noting why they beieve Adm. Doenitz should have been acquited.  This is a &quot;much needed&quot; reference book for those of us who are autograph-collecting &quot;hounds&quot; of WWII personalities.	2004-01-07

This trait is reflected in the books he has written: kindness; but with perhaps too much kindness in writing about the German generals that he served with.  In his dry style, writing a book as he would write a general-staff plan: just the facts, with little emotion. The generals that he served with, and thereby based his biographies on, include: Guderian, Manstein, Manteuffel, Model, Paulus, Rommel, Schoerner and several others.  To discuss these general's leadership skills, Mellenthin does recount their battles in France, Russia and Northern Africa.  In a chapter titled: \\"A Future War and Its Generals\\" he does briefly discuss Keitel and Jodl, noting that some of their leadership and strategy shortcomings stemed from them not having served as formation or battle-field commanders -- they could not really lead well, as \\"They had no understanding of what the troops wanted.\\"  This book is more of a review of his actions while serving with various generals -- a review of battle and command strategies -- than of any deep, scathing (critical) analysis of these inviduals' personalities.  Not an exciting read of combat hand-to-hand battles, but a nice lite review as to how the German military-education system influenced the development of these generals.  One wishes that Mellenthin would have been much more open in his discussing whatever \\"flaws\\" he might have seen in these officers, but, then Mellenthin is a product of being a gentleman officer.  It is intersting to see how he compares \\"dashing\\" generals such as Guderian or Manstein who favored quick, battle movement and would argue strategy with Hitler, versus the weaker \\"tepid\\" staff generals such as Paulus or Jodl.  What makes for \\"fun\\" (and informative) reading in this book are his personal insights from having served alongside these well-known generals.  Unfortunatley, this is a much-over looked book, and due to its brevity, scarcity and lack of serious criticism it is seldom \\"cited\\" as a source in other studies of WWII; but it does provide that rare \\"I was there\\" combat perspective from a German general staff officer who participated in almost all of the great land battles of WWII.  It is one that I re-read from time-to-time just for the interesting, personal insights.	2004-01-01

Books	5	32	40	N	N	Quran: It's Cleansing Sword for Pagans	The author of ISLAM AND TERRORISM cites specific Surahs(verses) in the Quran to show how Islam really doesn't &quot;tolerate&quot; Jews and Christians (&quot;People of the Book/Bible&quot;) and pagans/infidels (non-monotheists).  The Quran's Surah 9:5 is pretty clear: &quot;Fight and slay the Pagans wherever you find them....&quot;<BR>  The author explains &quot;Naskh&quot;: why contradictions appear to exist in the Quran.  Some verses tell Muslims to respect Jews and Christians (but only if they pay a tax), while others urge a Jihad against them.  What this author reveals is that Muhammad received different revelations from Allah at different times as to how the Jews and Christians were to be treated.<BR>  The later revelations against non-Muslims reverse the earlier toleration commandments.<BR>  This is the only book that I have found that extensively cites passages from the Quran to reveal how Usama/Osama bin Ladin's gang justify their killings of non-Muslims, including innocent women and children.<BR>  The author notes that the Quran is not written in a straight timeline.  Its chapters are not written in chronological order, but the largest chapters are followed by ever-smaller chapters.  One needs to obtain another booklet to learn how scholars  believe which chapter actually was revealed before the others.  This is necessary in trying to understand Allah's &quot;last&quot; views as revealed to Muhammad.  They changed; hence, one needs to know when each chapter was written in order to understand the which were the correct &quot;last&quot; or &quot;most up to date&quot; dictims from Allah: does he tolerate Jews or not?  Allah must not, as Muhammad ordered the killing of so many Jews, and ordered Jews and Christians out of Arabia.  (This explains why there are no Christian churches or Jewish synagogues in Saudi Arabia.  As a U.S. solider in Saudi Arabia during Gulf War I to liberate Muslim-Kuwait, we were told not to wear Christian crosses on the outside of our uniforms.  Also, when you check into a Saudi hotel, the registration card asks you your religion -- but the kind proprietor told me I really didn't have to note it.)<BR>  Too bad the critics of this book don't explain what specific falsehoods they find in it.  I looked up all of the citations in THE NOBLE QURAN (published by the government of Saudi Arabia) and found them to be accurate.  <BR>  A fine campanion book from this author is: ISLAM AND THE JEWS - THE UNFINISHED BATTLE.	2003-12-29

That started my interest in Islam, after noticing that the public buses in Saudi Arabia had signs on the front door directing: \\"Women enter through rear door.\\"  Why so? -- and what gives with all of these veiled women, and why were poor, foreign women with young babies begging for alms on the streets?  ISLAM AND THE JEWS cites verses in the Quran explaining the separation of the sexes in public places.  (The begging women turned out to be divorced women left on the streets to survive.)<BR>  What I really find so valuable about this book in how the author cites specifically numbered Surahs(paragraphs-verses)from the Quran/Koran in revealing the beliefs of Allah as given to the Angel Gabriel as spoken/recorded by Muhammad.  One can read the many other current books discussing Islam, but very few cite specific verses from the Quran to explain or justify WHY and/or HOW a Muslim is supposed to follow Islam.<BR>  This ex-Muslim Egyptian-born author details why there appear to be \\"contradictions\\" within the Quran.  Why is it reported in the American press that Islam respects Jews and Christians?  This book explains that when the Jews would not follow Muhammad's revelations, that he then received a new revelation that the only \\"good\\" Jews or Christians were those who would pay a tax(zakat) to the Muslims -- essentially, a \\"protection racket.\\"<BR>  This ex-Muslim author must be revealing the \\"truth\\" about the fundamentals of Islam, after all, just look at the sad, poor, embarrassing bad-mouthings that are written by his critics: they just don't like his documentation.<BR>  I have two of the Qurans mentioned in this book, the moderate Ali translation, as well as the English translation published by the religious ministry of Saudi Arabia: The Noble Quran.  I have looked at EVERY citation listed by this author, EACH one is a true and correct quotation!<BR>  The author explains that the Quran is not written in a straight timeline sequence.  It is recorded from the largest chapters to the shortest -- hence, the chronological dates of each chapter are all mixed up.  One has to refer to another booklet to see how scholars believe the chapters were revealed to Muhammad by date.<BR>  What is really enligtening in this book is that the author explains how Muhammad's (Allah's) views changed about Jews. Originally, Muhammad had tolerance for the Jews while he tried to entice them to convert to Islam and pay taxes to him.  However, when they didn't, Muhammad told his followers that it was okay to wage war against the non-Islams and loot their valuables. <BR>  This author's companion book: \\"Islam and Terrorism\\" makes a wonderful revelation (with specific verse citations) as to how the Quran justifies Usama/Osama bin Landen's suicide-bomber attacks against Christians.	2003-12-29

It is a listing of not only the names, but also reprints the official citations of some 500 military personnel who were awarded one of the 11 different medals issued for their heroic actions on Dec. 7, 1941.

This book reviews the publications of those who believe Pres. FDR and his advisors tried to keep secret Japanese military messages from the defenders of Pearl Harbor, in the president's attempt to entice the Japanese to bomb Pearl, in order to get the U.S. entered into WWII in order to assist the British in their war against Hitler. Whew, that's a lot to bite off in this short 189-page book written in 1978. Many conservatives (America First movement) understood that FDR wanted the U.S. to assist England, but they believed he was being duplicitous about how he wanted to get U.S. military forces involved in supporting England. It's an okay read for briefly reviewing the highlights of the various congressional inquiries into the Pearl Harbor attack, and explains why some believe that Adm. Kimmel and Gen. Short were wrongly blaimed for allowing the disaster to occur.  No new revelations are made of missing secret documents that might indict FDR. But it is of a beginner's interest in trying to understand the mindset as to how and why some believe that FDR was misleading the public into war against Germany, by enticing the Japanese to bomb the ill-informed U.S. fleet based in Hawaii.  To his credit, Mr. Bartlett wrote that he does not believe that FDR purposefully \\"set up\\" the Japanese to attack Pearl, but questions why certain Japanese messages inquring about the defenses of Pearl Harbor were withheld from the Hawaiian commanders.	2003-12-28
