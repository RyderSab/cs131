His voices are perfect and very period (1930's England).  And I actually caught things that I had not remembered from my first reading of this book a decade or so again.<br /><br />If Heyer does anything well she has an ear for slang.  I laughed out loud when Wally Carter (who had just confessed to some very bad behavior) was complaining about the fact that his neice and step daughter had found out about the behavior by reading a letter addressed to him.  \\"It's not,\\" he said sternly, \\"the clean potato.\\"  Never heard that saying before.<br /><br />Then there is the Prince, not to be mistaken for Prince the dog, and the histrionic former actress turned lady of the manor, Ermintrude.<br /><br />I agree that Heyer seems to have changed sympathies in main stream, but how could one not rather spend time with the imaginative Vickie than Mary who does have Solid Worth but is not nearly as much fun.	2005-09-20

A bad reader of even a favorite series book can send you back to print.<br /><br />The story is fun.  It's not full of Deep Thoughts and it makes a perfect distraction to gridlock traffic and an antidote to road rage.	2005-08-31

While this book is far better researched than the tabloidish My Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer, the two theories have something in common--  seriously weird fathers.  However Hodel has the advantage that his father was once considered a viable suspect by the L.A. police in this notorious 1947 crime.<br /><br />Even without the Black Dahlia hook, Steve Hodel's story of growing up on the west coast is interesting. With his parents at times among a very fast and easy setincluding John Huston and Man Ray, he covers a period that does not get a lot of attention these days. The Franklin Street house-- its architect was the son of Frank Lloyd Wright-- was something I had never heard about before.  (It actually looks a bit tasteless but fascinating-- a house shaped like a Mayan temple.)  Steve Hodel's own first marriage reads like something out of a screenplay written for a  movie of the period.<br /><br />If you don't choose to agree with the theory of the case he presents, this book is still well worth buying and reading.	2005-08-31

Her characters are complex and interesting if not always likeable.  She does not depend on romantic formulae when building her plot, even when there is a romance in the offing.  The soldier who is tired of war can be a cliche, but add that he also does not want to work in his family bakery and things get interesting.  But she doesn't stop with this, she moves 20 years ahead to engage his children in the reaping of a crop that was sewn one night in a town he stopped at on his way home-- a town where a girl saw her brother burned at the stake and found her own life in danger because of the power she held.	2005-08-11

Not a squamous or rugous part in sight. But once Green has created these imaginative creatures he is not sure what to do with them other than have them pound someone into the ground or be pounded into the ground by another character.<br /><br />The frame work of this book is familiar-- think A Fish Dinner in Memizon by E. R. Eddison and all of the other more modern authors mentioned by the other reviewers-- and Green draws on British legend and history in a way that is vaguely reminiscent of a lot of British writers.  But the mind does tend to wonder a bit between acts of mayhem.  And isn't the conclusion just a bit too pat?<br /><br />No matter, this one is worth a read and maybe if you are intrigued there is a whole world of British fantasy to explore that is not LotR or Harry Potter.	2005-07-24

It is a late 1980's history of forensic science.  I don't know if this is a case of clashing pages or clashing ISBNs but if you want a history of forensic science this is your book.<br /><br />Wilson in his nonfiction mode is sort of a compendium writer.  He rather reminds me of Charles Fort as he lays out his collection of cases involving forensic science.  At times he seems to embrace far from mainstream theories-- read his book Occult if you want to see how far from mainstream he can get-- but he does lay out cases from the earlier years of forensic science and cases that are not normally dealt with in the more popular books on this subject.<br /><br />Dated but worth a read if you are interested in the roots of the subject.	2005-07-15

Hot December, one of her earlier novels, is one of my favorites.  The heroine in this book could teach the majority of romance heroines a thing or two about strength, determination and guts.<br /><br />If you are looking for a strong, competent heroine who is not afraid to stand up to the men who surround her-- whose sinister \\"protection\\" theatens the farm in Texas cotton growing country she, her mother and sister inherited from her murdered father-- grab this book.<br /><br />Yeah, it's a real soap opera but an entertaining one.  The book opens with her father's mysterious death that catapults the heroine, back from her job crunching numbers in Houston for her father's funeral, into the role of farmer of the family acres.  Her determination to run the farm, instead of relying on her father's old friends to do it for her, leads to ominous threats.  Her father's farm manager who is supposed to be farming the acres elopes with her younger, more feminine, dimmer sister on an extended honeymoon to Mexico just at the time when the land had to be prepared for planting.  None of the other available farmers in the area are willing to help her because of the dark cabal that stands against her.<br /><br />She ends up turning to another outsider in the area, an immigrant from Eastern Europe whose own father had been cheated and betrayed by the same forces that face the heroine.  She makes a desperate bargain with him to save her farm.<br /><br />But if you are expecting the same old desperate bargain then you will be disappointed.  The heroine in this book is determined to work beside him and learn all she needs to know to be a sucessful cotton farmer.  There's the taste of dirt blowing in the wind, pesticides, and ice cold beer.  There's sudden violence, racism and stupid decisions made by smart women.  In the end a truly Machiavellian plot is revealed but the demand is for hard work and dedication to the land.e land.	2005-07-07

I can only conclude that Lynn Abbey wanted to write a cruise off on her income tax as research for a book but didn't have a very good time.<br /><br />Emma, whose life is not going well mainly because her job as a librarian is under seige with shakeups in management, agrees to  go on a cruise with her mother.  Then she is talked into driving all the way to Florida.  After they are on the ship she drinks both red wine and champagne-- bad idea for a migraineur!  At their first port of call, she and her mother get lost.  Emma's headache gets worse-- Arrgh, a migraine in the tropics!  And I recognized those red pills that the author gave her.  They are incredibly ineffective.  No wonder it was taking her days to shake it. Come into the 21st Century Em!<br /><br />Things continue to go downhill.  Souvenirs are tacky, there's an employee with a curse on board, Emma witnesses a suicide, there's food 24 hours a day every day.  And that headache keeps coming back.  Then just when it seems they are going to get to spend a few fun days at the world of the mouse, fate strikes again.  Oh yes, fate also has them driving through Atlanta on the interstate.<br /><br />Abbey seems to be losing her focus on the story arc but for Emma's fans (would can sympathize with the fact that given tremendous power she removes the gray from her hair) this is an interesting few days in her life.	2005-06-19

In this case for stance you either have to download the book in Audible.com's propietary format or juggle a box of 8 CD's.<br /><br />Johanna Parker is not a bad narrator but I prefer Christine Marshall who narrated an earlier novel by Harris.  The narration, nonetheless, is smooth with good production values.<br /><br />If I had my druthers, I would rather Harris backed off a bit on Sookie's love life-- her sensual assessment of every man who gets near her starts to pall after a while-- I would also like her to tighten up the mystery a bit.  The mystery took second place to all the supernatural high jinx and the book was not the better for it.	2005-05-27

Nearly 20 years ago I was delighted to find \\"Sorcery and Cecilia\\" (now \\"The Enchanted Chocolate Pot\\"-- it's original title I understand), a charming epistolatory novel set in an alternative Regency England.  Today I just finished reading the sequel and heartily regretting the wasted time.<br /><br />Here's the bad part:<br /><br />1) I could not tell the two heroines apart.  I was always having to back up and check to see who was whom and who was supposed to be married to whom.  The authors did not give them characters as much as tics. For instance one of them was clumsy which she spent a substantial amount of time bewailing.  Then when she wasn't clumsy she had to write or talk about that.<br /><br />2) The heroes were not particularly interesting.  I'm sure we have all had the experience of a friend falling tip over tup in love with someone whose charms we just can't see.  In this case the authors were paid to make me see those charms, and it just didn't come through.<br /><br />3) The alternative world didn't work very well for me.  The first  novel worked because the authors took the Regency world that all Heyer fans know so well and simply changed a few things-- like making sorcery work.  In this book there is a whole grand conspiracy with bits that are interesting and bits that aren't.  They also moved outside of England into Europe where a great deal more exposition was required.  It was given in big chunks instead of being woven into the story.<br /><br />So there we are.  I recommend the first one, I can't recommend this one except maybe for passing time in a dentist's waiting room or an extended layover in a very dull airport.	2005-05-21

Markman who holds degrees in both areas documents, through cases he has been involved with professionally-- some well known, some almost forgotten-- the tension that exists between justice and psychology.  The fact that someone may be mentally ill, but criminally culpable and that the system must decided both issues, is something that gets lost in the political frenzy that sometimes occurs when someone is accused of a highly charged crime.<br /><br />Markman notes that for political reasons certain criminals such as Charlie Manson and Sirhan Sirhan will never be released, although those who have done much worse have done much less time.  (Not that he is advocating for their release, he just wants to point out what we should all be aware of-- justice is not necessarily just.)  The fact that the Vampire of Sacramento was found sane was probably one of the great feats of judicial blindness of the 20th century.  However no one would possibly want him out walking the streets.<br /><br />Markman also discusses one of the sources of the great influx of homeless individuals onto the city streets in the latter part of the 20th century-- the \\"least restraint\\" laws that emptied into the streets individuals who were not capable of making their own way in the world due to mental illness.<br /><br />While probably a bit simplistic and certainly a bit self serving, I recommend this book to anyone interested in beginning  to learn about forensic psychiatry.	2005-05-21

At the time no one else was writing this type of character (and they are still rare compared to the overwrought, self-sacrificing heroine that appears so often in novels intended for women.) Mallory rarely errs on the side of emotion.<br /><br />And in this book it is rather interesting to watch Mallory wade through a potentially emotional morass involving Red Winter, the 70's former waif who was unexpectedly returned to her far from ecstatic family after her disappearance at the age of twelve.<br /><br />O'Connell once more does an excellent job of unwinding the tangled skeins of events.  It was only after I had finished the book that I realized that I hadn't caught the resolution of one particular plot thread and had to go back and reread part of it.  Otherwise, this is a Mallory novel to shelve with some of her best.	2005-04-25

The insight into the inner workings of the Anglican church (and the Anglo-Catholic nexus) are intriguing to say the least.

In this case the Happyface Killer tries to explain how he became a serial killer because of 1) his family; 2) society; 3) women and 4) alcohol. This list is not exclusive nor in any specific order.  I was rather tired of his self serving whining after the first chapter and it would have been better if there had been some balancing exposition from Mr. Olsen-- a writer I generally respect.<br /><br />This is certainly an antidote to the Hannibal Lector myth of the superior serial killer.  Jesperson is a remarkably banal sort of killer-- focused on sex and money.  Probably the most queasy making part of his story involves his claims of being a doting father intertwined with graphic scenes of brutality.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for those who want to romanticize the breed.	2005-03-07

Most of my experience of the Anglican religion has been fictional hard riding 18th-19th century clerics or fictional vague parsons with bodies in their libraries.  Fictional Anglican politics as set forth by Greenwood is an entertaining surprise.  Oh, yeah, and there is a murder also.<br /><br />The characters are good.  The writing is a pleasure to read.

Whether or not the person who actually had the murders pinned on him was guilty is a question that can lead to long discussions with friends of like reading tastes.

The reader, Raymond Todd, gave it truly heroic effort, but hearing the book out loud crystalized for me what was wrong with the writing and probably why I have never finished another one of the author's books.<br /><br />Admittedly this was a first published book-- but the amount of exposition in the first two thirds of the book is mind boggling.  Alec kept having these conversations about the way the world-- his world! worked so the reader could be clued in on information. It would have been better had the author woven most of this into the story rather than large chunks of plodding exposition.  Also, if we are to accept Alec's viewpoint as the reader's veiwpoint-- a sort of Watson character-- then it would have been better had the author stayed out of the other characters' heads this early in the story.  Then there was the mulling over of things.  For instance, there is a whole scene where, after being attacked by bandits, the party sits down and discusses at length what they learned from examining the effects of the dead bandits.  And it took them so long to arrive at the inevitable conclusion that I wondered that any of them had ever survived engagement in political intrigue before.<br /><br />Finally, after a long, uncomfortable and harrowing journey, Alec is told that it wasn't really necessary, it was sort of a character building exercise.  That really ticked me off.  I would have liked Kerry a lot better if he had just stalked off at that time with a hearty  good bye!<br /><br />As for Seregil-- there's not a lot that can be said about Seregil that isn't a spoiler,  However, he is just not as charming and interesting as one expects a man of mystery to be.<br /><br />Then there are the canoodling wizards and the apprentice whose purpose can be seen a mile way.<br /><br />All in all, it wasn't horrible but it could have been a whole lot better.hat really ticked me off.

Set some two hundred years before this trilogy, Element of Fire is not a prerequisite but it did remind me what a great adventure writer Wells is and how little really good adventure fantasy does get written these days.  So I grabbed volume one and two of this trilogy off the shelf and hid from the frigid weather in the luxurious staterooms of the Queen Ravenna,luxury liner turned world hopping battle ship.<br /><br />The background of this book is not mere wallpaper.  It's a richly realized world with characters who are both likeable and fallible.  There's heroes and traitors and \\"primitives\\" who refuse to be neatly pigeonholed.  There's politics and danger and a sly, dark humor that is really appealing.<br /><br />So now what am I going to do until the third installment is published?	2004-12-29

At first it is thought to be a rather straight forward drowning.  Then the medical examiner points out that her underwear and stockings suggest that either she dressed herself in a hurry in the dark or that someone else dressed her.  Suddenly, Mattie Harris' death puts into motion a great many actions by the men of the village, most of whom seem to have something to hide.<br /><br />This may not appeal to fans of traditional detective fiction, but don't let the fact that it is not in the ordinary vein stop you from enjoying a leisurely stroll through a vanished time including a good dash of suspense. Taylor has a great sense of detail and very good descriptive powers.  His characters are complex and fallible and almost-- forgive me-- Dickensian in their depiction.  His narrative appeals to all of the senses, whether he is describing a plunge off a bridge or a leisurely bath.<br /><br />I listened to the unabridged audio book in this case and cannot praise highly enough the vocal skills of the reader, Sheila Mitchell.  At times I almost forgot that it was not a full cast production.  The only difficulty I had was with the scene shifts. They were not always plainly marked so they caused a bit of confusion at times.  Otherwise I am sorry that it ended and plan to lay hands on the other books in the series whether printed or audio.	2004-12-26

The reader uses what was probably intended to be a Georgia accent.  I don't know if she knows what one sounds like but it watered down by a producer or she actually thinks that this was a Georgia accent-- but whatever the cause, this was BAD.  I was gritting my teeth over the narrator's nasal voice within the first five minutes.  Within the next five I was praying that someone would get killed so I didn't have to hear any more about the heroine's relationship with her ex-husband as they groped one another in  a crowded skating rink.  Finally, I gave it up as a bad job.<br /><br />I am left with only one burning question-- now mind I make no claim to being able to wear Cinderella's glass slipper myself-- but how big are the heroine's feet and why did she have to wear men's skates?	2004-11-23

H. Holmes is not an obscure serial killer (Bloch and Eckert among others fictionalized him and Schecter made him the subject of one of his obsessively researched true crime books.)  But giving equal billing to the events surrounding the building of the World's Columbian Exposition gave the entire work an unexpected depth of social history that went beyond a man murdering young women.  I'm sure lots of people besides me did not know what the Fair came up with to out-Eiffel Eiffel or the source of the tune that for generations accompanied cobras rising, swaying, out of baskets.<br /><br />I also have to commend the straight forward narrative.  I was forced to listen to this in bites of half hour or less but every time I turned it on it was easy to pick up the thread of the story.	2004-10-25

The book itself is well written, but becomes even better due to the narrator's skill with story telling.  Without becoming overly dramatic or incomprehensible (the reader uses various Irish accents to denote the characters and does a pretty good American one as well) she drags the listener into the horror and mystery of the story of a missing wife and child, a young woman discovered in a bog and the way a small village can turn on its own.<br /><br />Get the unabridged version.	2004-10-16

When I realized who wrote this book I grabbed it at once.  It is fascinating to see what experiences lie behind his soft manner, dry wit and occasional ascerbic comment.  There is also a streak of sentimentalism that I did not expect at all, but which is quite touching.<br /><br />If you are interested in reading about South Africa or the adventures of a medical man in a nation under stress then I would highly recommend this very readable book.	2004-10-15

HOWEVER, this book just has so many loose edges that can be picked.  For instance, the hero is blind (oh, and a Dutch Ear Nose and Throat Surgeon who is not just interested in T & A.  Tonsils and Adnoids, you dreadful thing!).<br /><br /> Harlequin probably could have started a separate line for blind heroes considering how often it came up-- of course the blind hero is nearly always cured by the last page but in this case the hero's blindness gets worse or better depending on whether the author needs him to draw the heroine closer emotionally or push her away without an explanation.  You see, he couldn't saddle her with a blind man-- sob.  Talk about a politically incorrect attitude-- it is offensive to women who might just find a man to be worthwhile without regard to his sight and to people who are blind.  Heck, it probably is also offensive to Dutch Ear Nose and Throat Surgeons.<br /><br />I was wondering during one of the dull patches in this book what would have happened had the hero had some really challenging problem instead of this coming and going blindness-- a very bad case of warts for instance, or some lower intestinal problem.  That would have really told us something about the heroine's character.  Instead he is bad tempered and she is weepy.<br /><br />One interesting point but it's not enough to save the book-- the person who actually does the work in the household, Jan, is a concentration camp survivor who would have made a great tormented hero and who does get a bit of a story of his own.  Odd how the one who has real cause for self pity bears up so much better than the hero.	2004-10-14

It starts with the so-called hero telling his mistress (who is a married woman) goodby in the coldest terms after making love to her. (I found that particularly repulsive.)  The writer of course tries to demonize the Other Woman but succeeds only in making the hero look like an adultrous jerk.  The plot device known as the Other Woman then starts looking for revenge (and who could blame her?)<br /><br />And to anyone who wants to insist that this is historically accurate, I would like to point out that at least the appearance of decency and politeness were highly prized during the Regency period.  (Book is set in 1818) His gauche behavior would not have won him anyone's admiration at the time or later.<br /><br />The writer of course is demonizing the Other Woman so she can drag out some virginal twit to \\"redeem\\" the hero.  Except he isn't redeemed, he just transfers his lust to said virginal twit. Some romance writers have been allowed to get away with shoddy plotting and bad characterization as long as they deliver the goods.  The goods being a happily ever after ending with some emotional feel-good buzz that passes for love-- no matter how unlikely it is that the mismatched couple would be able to forge a relationship that would withstand adversity.<br /><br />I guess Sturgeon's Law (\\"Sure, 90% of science fiction is crud. That's because 90% of everything is crud.\\" )applies to every genre, it's just that it is more obvious in romance because there is so much of it published.<br /><br />Avoid this book if you like characterization, plotting and historical accuracy.	2004-10-14

At his worst he sounds like he is across the room shouting the narrative at you.  His detective, Sister Fidelma comes across like a mixture of Perry Mason, Kung Fu and Sherlock Holmes, with poor old Brother Ealdwolf her happy bumbling Watson.  However there are simply not enough books about Dark Age (he would dispute the term) Irish judge magistrates in a religious order.<br /><br />In this book where we have Sister Fidelma leaving Ealdwolf behind as she ponders her dedication to law and religion, she sets sail with a group of contentious and mismatched pilgrims.  And, lo and behold, she finds one of the pilgrims to be a blast from her own past.  And he hasn't changed much at all.  Then a woman disappears and is presumed lost overboard and Fidelma begins to investigate that and other strange happenings on a small boat.<br /><br />Add Saxon slavers (Wo-DEN, Wo-DEN), heavy weather at sea and a dreadful ship wreck resulting in a rescue that further complicates the case.<br /><br />You can tell that Tremayne is really trying to give Sister Fidelma more depth and character and because he is doing something different I'm inclined to give him an A for Effort.	2004-10-08

Books	4	4	5	N	N	The Boogey Man Is Going to Get You If You Don't Watch Out	When Schechter noted that at the time of writing Albert Fish's defense attorney was alive at 89 I realized that this story did not  happen all that long ago as historical crimes run.  It is possible that people who were victimized by Fish as children would be still living although Schechter doesn't deal with this one way or the other.<br /><br />However, the world of Albert Fish, of trusting parents sending their daughter off with fatherly strangers, seems so distant that it might as well have been set on another world.<br /><br />Albert Fish is the stuff of nightmares and Schechter does an excellent job of recreating the time in which he lived and preyed on young children.  While the author does take literary license at time with recreating certain scenes he also makes no pretense to be writing anything other than a work of popular nonfiction. This is the only book length work about Fish and as such belongs on the shelf on all who are interested in historical murderers.<br /><br />Anyway if you want to read about someone who clearly met the definition of the title and who is one of the less well known monsters who populated the world prior to WW II then this is your book.	2004-09-19

This book was going along pretty well (although I wasn't particularly taken with any of the characters) but it sort of fell apart in the middle.  I know why her character went to Spain (but I can't say because it would be a spoiler) but this section quickly grew very uninteresting and the book never recovered its momentum.<br /><br />Also, this is another one of those books where there is not much suspense about whodunnit.  This can be well done, but it wasn't well done here.  The book is a journeymanlike work without the spark that keeps one reading late into the night.<br /><br />The story of Fiona Cameron's emotional problems surrounding her sister's death is also unsatisfactory and rather wimpy and the climax of the main story is-- well, anti-climax.  I don't know if she has just lost interest or what, but I wish she would go back to doing what she used to do so well, throat gripping suspense.

The Squire, who had made an appearance in a previous book, is a Nice Guy (kind of Beta) who has learned to make the best of a mediocre marriage.  He is happy enough with most of what his life has brought him and now seeks to straighten out a mess from his wife's second marriage-- he is her third husband.  Lady Blaunche, his wife, who is far more what would be expected from a medieval character, doesn't see what all the fuss is about.  I had to admire her though for going after what SHE wanted after two marriages where the men got what THEY wanted.<br /><br />I would probably have enjoyed this book more if I had not been anticipating a more traditional mystery.  The author writes well and her subject matter is interesting, but by concentrating on the  domestic rather than the civil issues she misses a chance to write a far more interesting novel.  It also seemed a bit short with the ending being cobbled together, more groundlaying about the murder's character would have been nice.	2004-08-27

From the book where the woman woke up from a months long coma with long manicured nails to the one where an inexperience forensics team estimated height and weight of a murder victim from a box of bone fragments, I've often found myself being jerked out of the story by some easily checked error. While I had hoped for rather better because this was her hardcover debut, I was doomed to disappointment again.<br /><br />While I can suspend belief to accept the psychic part, its the mundane details she misses that gets me.<br /><br />I see someone has already commented about Hooper's off the wall view of schizophrenia, but what about the FBI agent who had checked all the pharmacies within a hundred miles and no one was taking \\"schizophrenia medicine\\"?  Because there is no specific medication for schizophrenia and the medications used in its treatment are often prescribed for other mental illness, I could only assume, all other evidence of rampant alcoholism, sado sexual murder and family violence aside, Hastings, South Carolina is the mental health capital of the United States.<br /><br />Then there is the FBI agent in tight jeans with a calf holster.  No matter how good their tush looks, no one who depends on a gun to save their life is going to use a calf holster exclusively.  Sheesh, how do you get to it standing up?<br /><br />I'm not even going to talk about her lack of knowledge about how bodies decay, especially in late spring in South Carolina locked in with rats and certainly not impervious to flies.  Read Death's Acre by William M. Bass if you want to know more.<br /><br />All in all, I think that Hooper needs a fact checker and an editor who is willing to call her on these lapses.  She also failed to engage my interest with the characterization.  If the reader was new to the series I have no idea how they would have been able to figure out who was who with the introduction of so many characters from the early series.so many characters from the early series.	2004-08-22

Laura (the older sister) is 29.  Joyce (the brat) is 20.  The Dutch doctor-- Reiloff  van Meerum-- is 38.  By page 25 Joyce is talking about marrying the doctor and Laura is jealous.  By page 55 Joyce has run off with someone else and Laura is proposing to Reiloff.<br /><br />There's a great deal else that goes on but this is the one time that Laura really makes an effort to get what she wants.  She falls back on the floor in doormat position for the rest of the book, alternating between getting her feelings hurt and resolving to not make any demands on Reiloff.<br /><br />One wonders if maybe spinsterhood has not softened Laura's brains at the advanced age of 29.  What she wants is a man fast approaching middle age who had intended to marry a girl barely out of adolescence with no character.  Yep, this 20 year old had run rings around a sophisticated, rich Dutch doctor. Meanwhile  Laura is wringing her hands and their father is smiling benignly on the situation.  Nobody even seems to think it is extraordinarily peculiar when Joyce is marrying someone else and Laura is taking over Joyce's place as the van Meerum bride to  be.<br /><br />The only person in this whole mess who shows any real personal  growth is van Meerum and that doesn't seem due to any real introspection (or least none the reader is privy to), it just happens.<br /><br />This is probably an ok read if you want to indulge in a pity party for Laura.

There's a certain careless racism that caused me a little niggle of discomfort but, fear not, the Europeans come in for their fair share of ridicule as she skewers the members of the dig and their staff.<br />Those who enjoy Elizabeth Peters' mysteries set in Egypt (at admittedly an earlier period) might also enjoy this glimpse into what a dig in the desert could be like.<br />Just to put things in perspective, Mallowan (Christie's archaeologist husband) had begun his career digging with Leonard Woolley and Christie is writing oh so casually about events that underpin some of what is going on in that part of the world now.  The massacre of Armenians and the differences between the Kurds and the Arabs are now writ large in our news reports.	2004-06-17

They in fact took to this belief with a fervor usually reserved for predictions about the end of the world--- give away all of your property and come sit in this cave to wait for it to happen.<br />And the author has done a lot of research into the state of the nerves of America in the last half of the 19th century-- bad, very bad.  But it's the application of the research to the case of Mollie Francher that hits a bump in the road.<br />Did she have multiple personalities?  Was she a hysteric?  Did she suffer from chlorosis?  Neuresthenia?  Anorexia Nervosa?  Take your pick.  There is support for all of these.  She could twist herself into shapes that would have astonished the exocist, lay for weeks and months in a trance, claimed to be completely blind while turning out fancy work-- sold in a shop on the ground floor of her home, and displayed what appeared to be psychic abilities.<br />It was very interesting to read about the birth pangs of psychiatry and the personalities who midwived it.  Chlorosis (green sickness) and neuresthenia seemed similar in description to modern chronic fatigue syndrome.  I took a liking to railway spine (caused by traveling at such a high rate of speed)and in light of some of the information provided, the case of Mrs. Palsgraf and the Long Island Railroad Company, that has bedeviled many a first year Torts student makes more sense.	2004-06-10

If anyone seriously thinks that Harris writes cozy mysteries then they are not paying attention when they read.  The author who writes the edgy Lily Bard mysteries and the Sookie Stackhouse stories, has never been one to allow her characters more than time to catch their breath between disasters.  Whether it was the death involved with the true crime group she was a member of in the first mystery to her subsequent detective efforts, Aurora has lost friends, neighbors and enemies to the grim reaper.  Harris never lets the reader assume that there is a Happily Ever After ending out there.  Good things are balanced with bad.<br />In this case Aurora loses an old friend and a new one, learns things about the murdered person and her family she would just as soon not know and there are still a lot of loose strings after the murderer is revealed to fuel the next book.<br />I enjoyed the characters and the writing but it almost seems that the mystery was an afterthought.  I guessed who the murdered was on first introduction (off stage). Harris gave away the important clues with the very nonchalant air with which she introduces them.  The denoument was almost anticlimatic.  The death in this case seemed to be more a peg on which to hang the characters and events than the reason for the existence of the book.<br />Not bad, but she's done (and hopefully will do) better.	2004-06-04

The set up for this story is one that is all too common in real life.  A family member has a health crisis, the other family members rush to help them through it. Somehow the sick person never improves; in fact they begin to enjoy ill health because of the secondary gains of attention, lack of responsibility and no need to make a living.<br />By staying a home, catering to her father's every whim and giving him additional financial support, Florina was actually encouraging her father to continue as an invalid. After all his heart attack had been 10 years before. It was rather disappointing that she showed no real concern for her father when she tried to extricate herself from the situation.  Instead of trying to help her father achieve independence, she simple continued her enabling pattern by finding another woman (her father's sister) to continue the duties she was abandoning.<br />It is also clear that had the perfect job not dropped in her lap, Florina would have stayed as her father's unpaid servant.  As it was she went to the home of another man as his very well paid cook.<br />The hero in this book also appears to be drifting into an unsuitable marriage with a woman who is clearly not a GOOD woman, with GOOD women defined as those who enjoy domestic activities-- such as cooking.  The hero was arrogant enough to think that he was going to change her into something he wanted, while she was planning to change the hero.  These two unsuitable people were happily separated by Florina's appearance on the scene.<br />In this case neither the hero or heroine needed a gentle awaking, they needed a brass band to get them up.	2004-05-27

As in several of her other cases, Miss Silver is approached by a person who wishes her help.  The next thing she knows the person's murder is headlined in the paper.<br />This is a not too shabby locked room mystery.  The locked room is a windowless annex to a country club (once the murderee's private home).  It has one door for which there are only two keys, one in the possession of the owner, the other in the hands of his secretary.  The approach to the annex is along a glassed in corridor that is lighted at night so that any person using that route may be seen.<br />Yet one day Lewis Brading is found dead in the annex and it seems that only one man could have murdered him.  However Miss Silver is there to make sure that the guilty and not the innocent suffer.<br />Nice collection of eccentrics, interesting post WWII milieu. Pretty good mystery.	2004-05-27

Actually, it seems inappropriate to call her a heroine because she does nothing at all positive or active.  She is always the one acted upon. However, I can't remember her name although I've just read it so she is &quot;heroine.&quot;<br />Let's see, she is twenty-seven (but looks ten years younger).  The hero is thirty-four (but looks younger).  Her sister, Virginia, is twenty (how old does she look, ten?) She raised Virginia after their parents death and made a complete hash of it.  Of course no one ever acknowledges that the person who would have had the most influence on Virginia's character is her only sister.  Virginia is spoiled, ill tempered, and without morals or manners.  She is verbally and psychologically abusive to her sister, rude to her neighbors and we are asked to believe that because she is beautiful everyone puts up with it.  Her sister responds by giving her money to buy things.<br />At some point before the story starts the heroine asks her neighbor and childhood friend, Lucian, to squire Virginia around and try to pry off some social barnacles.  Lucian, obligingly does.  Then the heroine gets upset because Lucian does what she asks.  Lucian after a while indicates that he does not intend to marry Virginia.  When the story opens the heroine is furious at Lucian because he has broken Virginia heart-- as if the little baggage had one!  She seems to have forgotten that he ws only taking Virginia around because she asked him to do so.<br />The hero also has his problems though.  His interest is in the sister that he can mould to his tastes.  He is extremely manipulative as he manipulates the heroine into a &quot;fake&quot; engagement.  This requires him to take her to London to pick out clothes-- indeed he guides her toward what he wants her to wear.  He is possessive when another man comes around and manipulates the situation so that she is not home when the other man is to call.  He manipulates her into a Greek holidy.  He does everything but sit down and have a heart to heart talk about feelings.  Probably it would have been no use though since the heroine is such a dimbulb.<br />Of course there is a Big Misunderstanding, that fortunately lasts only a few pages.  It is precipitated by Virginia, back from her honeymoon just in time to try to rain on her sister's parade.<br />I wanted to grab the whole lot of the characters in this book and shake some sense into them-- hard.so that she is not home when the other man is to call.

Josephine Dowling is the eldest of the local doctor's three children.  She is working as a ward sister at a London hospital.  One day She is walking her dog on a visit to her home when she (and the dog) are nearly run down by a Bentley.  (Neels has a thing about cars, she makes as much of the cars as she does the houses, the clothes and the food.)  Inside the car is Julius van Tacx, a large Dutch doctor.<br />Inevitably they clash and inevitably they find themselves working together.<br />However the misunderstanding is kept to a minimum and only occurs toward the end, mainly this is the story of two people falling in love with no big dramatics or fireworks.  The most outstanding thing about the heroine is that she is a size fourteen.  However, she doesn't obscess on her size.<br />Looking for a pleasant and undemanding romance?  It's here.	2004-05-12

In this case the PR firm of Perkins and Tate faces the true test of public relations-- putting a favorable spin on the death of a public figure in their dentist's chair.  Surrounded by a plethora of eccentrics including Malcolm-- the dentist's father, who still thinks a world war is going on-- I or II, he isn't picky; the dentist's wife who was not so much stolen by the dentist's partner as barrowed; and the dentist himself who is quite single minded when it comes to things dental.<br />This is is a fun and not particularly serious novel that will happily pass an hour or two.	2004-05-03

Then the angler's head with a gun shot wound turns up in a trawler's net.  An attempt is made to investigate, but the police are stymied.  So they send in Napoleon Bonapart, their best detective.<br />Then Boney starts to fish-- and he fishes and he fishes.  I don't have any ethical problem with fishing as a sport, but I found myself feeling a bit indignant about the wastefulness of catching a 580 lb. fish for sport, hanging it up by it's tail on the &quot;town triangle&quot; to have pictures taken, then disposing of it after a few days when it probably rank.<br />Boney the fisherman is not nearly as interesting as Boney the detective.<br />Oh, as for the mystery, it was pretty obvious by mid book (if not earlier) who had done the angler in and why.  The how was not as obvious though.<br />Unless you like long descriptions of fishing activity I recommend reading The Bone Is Pointed or one of the other books in this series instead.	2004-04-26

At last, someone was writting urban fantasy for the woman I had become.  The main character in this story, Emma, is a woman of a certain age ahead of two bad marriages, some good step children, her father's death and her mother's disappearance when she was an infant.  In the first book in the series her mother reappears and Emma's life has not been the same since.<br />Emma is a curse hunter, one of a group of people with special powers and the ability to travel to another dimension.  Their goal is to destoy the curses that are nurtured by human misfortune.  But Emma came to her talent late and did not have the indoctrination of most curse hunters so she is a wild card, or a black sheep as her stepfather says.<br />In this section of the story while trying to moot a particularly odd curse she runs into the Curia, the official curse hunter society and must deal with not just the curse but the other hunters as well.<br />Blaise, her ghostly SO, makes an appearance along with other characters from the earlier books.<br />While I probably should knock a star off because this book is obviously a wind up for the next book, I'm not going to do it.  These books are too scarce to damn with faint praise.  So at the top of lungs:  THANK YOU MS ABBEY, THIS BOOK REALLY HIT THE SPOT.	2004-04-19

The heroine in this case is the middle class daughter of a bank manager.  Her father appears to exist to drive her to and from places.  The hero is a certified public accountant.<br />The heroine is a trained Nanny whose cousin guilts her into taking a temporary job caring for three children whose mother is dealing with her own mother's health crisis.  The children are nice, the mother is nice, the grandmother is nice, the servants are nice.  After the grandmother gets better they all go to someplace warm for a few weeks.  The heroine's father drives her to the air port.<br />I had my eyes propped open with toothpicks by this point but doggedly went on to finish this book in which nothing much happens at all.<br />The secret of Romance as a genre is that certain writers have tapped into a powerful fantasy among enough women to sell a steady number of their books. When my mind wandered from the story (frequently) I was trying to figure out who the target audience was.  Ms. Neels would have been in her 70's when she wrote this book.  The heroine like most of her heroines is old fashioned in her outlook and actions.  In Betty Neels books being up to date seems to equate to a loss of morals and manners. Domesticity is seen as the ultimate virtue.  My guess is that the audience was supposed to be women of her own age and I would further guess the economic level was probably working class to lower middle class.  The servant class and middle class are usually portrayed as honest and hard working.  The upper class comes in for knocks.  The perfect hero seems to be a professional with a solid income, a house with servants and a nice car or two.  Good temperment is optional.<br />With younger people Neels' charm seems to be a certain camp quality: the lovingly detailed descriptions of meals; how her heroines never blushed, they pinkened; and her fascination with doctors from the Netherlands.  At the top of her form she's good, here she isn't.l.<br />With younger people Neels' charm seems to be a certain camp quality: the lovingly detailed descriptions of meals; how her heroines never blushed, they pinkened; and her fascination with doctors from the Netherlands.

Her parents made sure that she had no training for any type of practical work before they died.  So at 26 she finds herself having to look for work for the first time as her bother takes the lion's share of the banking account and heads for the US.<br />At this point I was scratching my head because the brother was going to what sounded like a Graduate Assistant's position at Boston University.  He was provided for, so it seems that it would be more sensible for him to leave most of the money with Jemima.  Of course she would not have been in such desparate straits as to accept Lady Manderly's employment and end up living in a bedsitter over a stationer's shop in abject poverty had they done the logical thing.<br />Anyway she ended up as companion to a difficult old lady with a poodle, some elderly but devoted servants and a nephew who is a broad chested, rich, obnoxious endocrinologist.  Alexander, the nephew, also was running around with Gloria who was sort of a Mod with very bad manners.<br />Jemima is actually a nice, well-mannered person.  She soon has everyone in the household eating out of her hand.  I liked Jemima who stands up for herself.<br />Poor Gloria doesn't have a chance though.  The author makes her a caricature of a selfish little rich girl.  You have to ask yourself why Alexander was spending quite a bit of time leading Gloria on if he doesn't even like her.  Of course courtesy is not high on his list of qualities.  Arrogance and rudeness are near the top.<br />Jemima certainly deserves a more considerate hero but apparently a rich alpha jerk was the fantasy hero of the day so that's what she gets.  Luckily most of the book concentrates on Jemima as she copes with the events in the book rather than their romance.	2004-04-06

She was a great comfort read.  No matter how beleaguered her cookie cutter heroines were, one knew a big burly Dutch surgeon, or some other rich professional was going to rescue them from their lives of poverty and toil.<br />This book does not vary from the template and it's not one of her best.  The heroine, Prudence, is 27 years old. She is the daughter of a middle class vicar, she has never held a job, and when she saw Benedict van Vinke, a broad chested Dutch Docter, at her sister's wedding she realized that her four year engagement to Tony, an architect, might lack a little something.<br />I had a lot of sympathy for the discarded architect.  He seemed to be a bit shallow but a nice steady sort with an eye to his business advancement and proper social connections. He had absolutely no idea that his fiance wasn't happy until she started making up to van Vinke at the reception. When he reacted with a jealousy he didn't want to admit, instead of trying to talk about it, Prudence decides to break the engagement.  Of course she doesn't want to tell him until she has a job.<br />Prudence strikes me though as being a passive dependent type. After all she went along with the engagement for four(!) years and didn't think to do anything about it until she sees another man she finds attractive.  She doesn't want to tell him that she is breaking the engagement until she has a place to land.  When she dumps the fiance it is at a after-party supper in front of her sister, her sister's husband and van Vinke-- and she almost doesn't then but all the others insist.  Besides publically humilating him in front of his rival, he is also told Prudence is going off to Holland with van Vinke to be his personal assistant.  Poor Tony the Architect.<br />Of course van Vinke's first wife, now conveniently dead, comes in for a trashing also.  She was frivolous, didn't like his friends, etc.<br />Luckily we all know that the hero and heroine are perfect for one another, that once they get over their Big Misunderstandings they will live happily ever after.  Prudence will always think van Vinke is pretty wonderful and van Vinke will agree.all know that the hero and heroine are perfect for one another, that once they get over their Big Misunderstandings they will live happily ever after.

The American title seems to place too much emphasis on the murder, whereas the British title suggests that it is the overall situation that should be examined.<br />I have to agree that this is not the book for the rank newcomer to the Hill/Lloyd saga but for those of us who have been following the ups and downs of DCI Hill and Lloyd and Their bedeviled police force, this is a good read.<br />While the mystery is not all that impenetrable, the characters are well drawn-- I always find myself jolted by the realization that the British aren't Americans with funny accents-- and the plot, while ultimately relying on concidence, turns on the issues raised by the above mentioned births, deaths and marriages.<br />Easy to pick up, hard to put down.	2004-04-01

This book tumbled out of my hands and hit the floor about the point that the female FBI Agent and the female Vampire began to insult one another about their respective weights.  That has to be a new low in vampire fiction.  The other times the book fell out of my hands was because I could no longer keep my eyes open as Nez and Lopez have long pointless conversations with the occasional coy romantic comment.  I think that the FBI agent who was killed early in the book got off easily compared to those of us who stayed to the end.<br />The authors cannot resist hopping on every new bandwagon that goes by, unfortunately they forget to get off the old bandwagons.  Therefore, in this book we have a female FBI agent out to avenge her dead partner, skinwalkers (sort of Navaho Werewolves), German vampires, and a Navaho vampire state cop also out to avenge his dead partner (who was killed in 1945).  All of the characters are one dimensional at best.<br />The skinwalkers are inherently evil and hunt vampires for no discernable purpose except the authors needed some action to propel the story to its next stage.  The German vampires are equally purposeless except they want to get their hands on a case that might (no one really knows for sure) contain uranium or plutonium or something radioactive-- so much of this book is just two characters who have no facts engaging in fruitless speculation.<br />Let's not forget the writing.  There is a lot of telling and not showing with strange moments of exposition that make me think that the authors had suddenly thought of something they should have mentioned earlier, so they jam it into the conversation whether it feels natural-- if any of the conversation in this book seems natural-- or not.<br />I think I should say something positive about the book, though.  The dust jacket on the hard cover is rather clever and unusual.  Shame it couldn't be on a better book.	2004-03-22

In other words it would have been pretty good from anyone else but just a bit of a let down from her.<br />The law enforcement types were mostly familiar from her last couple of books.  She advanced some of their personal lives and maybe that was the problem.  The personal matters seemed to be of equal importance to the suspense plot and this seemed to drag things down a bit.<br />The plot is suitably complicated though and Gerritsen does a great job of connecting the dots to bring it all together.	2004-03-15

It shows in this first book in this series.  For instance there is the recently widowed mother who keeps making coy attempts at matchmaking her daughter(didn't realize matchmaking was one of the stages of grief); the FBI agent with an anger control problem who could have doubled as a Harlequin alpha jerk hero-- oh, but he must have some redeeming qualities, he likes children; and the all round good guy old high school flame who everyone but the heroine seems to realize lusts after her.<br />The action scenes are also clumsy.  My favorite was the scene where Ella is driving a pickup truck (I lost track of the number of pickup trucks that were destroyed in the making of this story), there is a slavering, biting coyote head stuck through the back window.  She draws her gun from a (waist?) holster and shoots it between the eyes without out even going into a ditch.  Then she shoots one off the hood through the windshield.  I would think it would be better for her ability to see had she slammed on the brakes or hit the accelerator instead.  Physically improbable as these actions are, it is still preferable to the fact that Ella tends to need to be rescued at most other points in the book.<br />She does, however, have the Nancy Drew like quality of stumbling on just the place where the bad guys are having a palaver at just the time to hear what she needs to hear to advance the plot.<br />All in all, I cannot see any reason to compare this book to Tony Hillerman.  I will admit though that there are a couple of effective scary moments-- immediately spoiled by Ella's shrill insistance there is no supernatural agents involved.  If I was Navaho I might also be offended by the scene where a ritual singer is shot and the whole crowd rushes for their cars without even checking to make sure first aid isn't needed.	2004-03-14

A friend urged me to read this book knowing that I had some interest in Arthurian lore and in feminist theory.  The author has me puzzled on both accounts.  It's not just that she posits some unusual ideas, it's the flat statements of fact she makes.  I know of nothing that backs up some of her conclusions-- and the author does not support these statements with any citations.  The first one that really brought me up short was something like, Guinevere's marriage contract with Arthur made her his archivist.  That is not a direct quote but it's close enough.  Marriage contract?  Where did this document come from?  And why would she be made her husband's archivist?<br />So, if you are looking for ideas for speculative fiction about Guinevere this is the place to look. If you are looking for facts about Dark Age Britain then look elsewhere.	2004-03-11

Upright men of the Watch and Ward prowl the red light section searching for moral offenses and offenders.  A single misstep by a woman leads to social and familial ostracism and eventually death-- if the woman is not lucky enough to attract the attention of Agatha Montgomery, Directoress of Bertram's Bower, a facility for the reclaiming of fallen women.<br />Addington and Caroline Ames (with their devoted Dr. McKenzie)set out to aid Agatha and by extention the habitues of Bertram's by trying to help the police solve the case of the murdered ex-prostitutes.  The reader who sets out with them gets a fascinating look at Boston in the 1890's, warts and all.  The contrasts are striking.  Along the way we meet a woman who was a passionate abolitionist in her youth in the same city where the advertisements for jobs that state NINA (No Irish Need Apply). One of the good things about this book is that Ms. Peale lays this information out without preachiness. The reader is allowed to discover things for herself.<br />During the course of the investigation, Addington is tempted from his uprightness by a fallen woman turned actress and Caroline begins to wonder if maybe it isn't some one else's turn to do some good.<br />This book reminds me of those fascinating interior photographs of Victorian homes-- rooms crammed so full of treasures that the eye has trouble making sense of it, but a rich trove once the pattern is decerned.	2004-03-05

However, he is called back to New England in the middle of a February blizzard when he receives a long, incomprehensible cable from Bill Porter, scion of the Porter Motor Company Porters-- those who have met Asey before may remember that Asey drives a 16 value Porter roadster in some of the other books.<br />Bill, you see, has an old college enemy-- a hard drinking, hard smoking, villainous looking fellow named Harper who lost the Big Game for them in college by running the wrong way with the ball into the other team's end zone. On the anniversary of that date Harper and Bill always get in a fight.  But this year Bill is determined to end the tradition-- that is until Harper insults Asey's detecting ability-- Bill ends up involved with a bet of $50,000 that Asey can solve the mystery of a grocery list made out a year before by Harper's deceased aunt.<br />However, the mystery that absorbs Asey is the murder of Harper's other aunt under very unusual circumstances.  Once again character development and plot lose out to the biggest mess of red herrings that this reader has ever encountered.  Figuring out who did it wasn't that hard having read a few other books by the author, but how it was done gives the deducting part of the brain a bit of workout.<br />Again if you like puzzle mysteries--	2004-02-24

The author has toned down the dialect much to my relief.  And, yes, she does put the term Codfish Sherlock in the mouth of one of her characters describing the lean and salty Asey Mayo.  (Makes him sound like a rasher of bacon.) Taylor has at least in this book dropped the first person narrator in favor of straight third person. Also the title does not refer to a blow but to a punch in a ticket.<br />World War II is over and a group of people going to college on the GI bill come to Study the small Cape Cod town where Asey lives.  The leader of this group is Caroline Boone, the world renown expert (it's not at all clear what she is an expert on, but we are assured she has appeared in the newsreels almost as often as Asey).  Doc Cummings arrives at Asey's door with an urgent invitation to go meet Ms. Boone just as Asey is about to sit down to lunch .<br />Again, the puzzle is the centerpiece of the book.  Bodies (alive and dead) appear and disappear, there's red herrings (or Cods) galore and a secret room that may or may not exist.  Let's not forget to mention the radio quiz show that obsesses nearly everyone in the village.<br />If you really like puzzle pieces then you might like this book.  The author plays pretty fair.  The characters, though, seem like two dimensional constructs going through their allotted actions to make the mystery come out right.	2004-02-20

The fact that it is possible to suggest a dialect without spelling out every speech difference had not occurred to a lot of people including the author of this book.<br />The second limitation on mysteries at this time was that the puzzle was the thing that caught people's interest.  Reading a mystery was considered something like doing the Sunday Times Crossword puzzle.  That is why there was such a big emphasis on the author playing fair with the reader.<br />The Asey Mayo books contain both the best and the worst of mysteries of this time.  Don't expect to know more about what makes Mayo tick at the end of the book than the beginning.  He is really just a bundle of qualities and knowledge that leads to the elucidation of the mystery.  If someone is doing origami he can do origami better, and he learned it from some extraordinary character that he met under extraordinary circumstances.  He also drives a 16 cylinder open car that he inherited from one of his employers, is apparently quite well off, and no one knows exactly how old he is.<br />Briefly, this mystery involves a small group of authors, corrupt lawmen and employees limited to a small tavern in Weesit.  The murdered person was found dead in a room with a blind boy with a broken ankle who knew nothing about the killing (they were listening to the radio together).  The obvious suspect was found coming into the room with a just washed knife-- she said she had been cleaning a chicken in the kitchen.<br />So without modern forensics or, indeed any type of forensics-- Asey just assumes the person would be too smart to leave fingerprints, he and the daughter of a wealthy coffee merchant family (who narrates) sets off to figure out who had motive, means and opportunity.  And they must do it before the obvious suspect is railroaded by the corrupt lawmen.<br />Depending on your tolerance for the two factors I mentioned about mysteries of this period, you will either go along to enjoy the ride or throw the book out the window./>Depending on your tolerance for the two factors I mentioned about mysteries of this period, you will either go along to enjoy the ride or throw the book out the window.	2004-02-16

Not even if the sexual chemistry was really hot.<br />Ok, maybe if the sexual chemistry was really hot, I would do it.<br />This is an above average gothic read, and the sexual chemistry is really hot, especially for a book published in the mid sixties.  In the US this was published as The Shrouded Tower.	2004-02-10

Pilgrim Pater was killed in a riding accident while his son Roger was overseas and just after he had broke the entail to sell his white elephant of a house, Pilgrim's Rest.  Captain Jerome is a semi-invalid due to his psychological response to the wounds he received at Dunkirk-- thank goodness for his devoted nurse who tries so hard to keep him from becoming excited.  Nephew Henry Clayton who had worked for the Information Ministry disappeared on the eve of his wedding to a local heiress between the time he was observed leaving his house and the front door of his fiance's house a few dozen yards away.  Jack was taken prisoner by the Japanese in Singapore and his fate is unknown.<br />When Roger comes home to Pilgrim's Rest to wind up his father's affairs though, he barely escapes two nearly fatal accidents that might have been attempts on his life.  On the advice of an old friend who works for Scotland Yard he asks Miss Silver to come to his home and investigate the situation there.  Miss Silver, of course, is only too delighted.<br />There's lots of stuff crammed this mystery which keeps the interest.  However, there are some negatives including an overly precious child.  The darling Penny talks in a way I can't imagine even British WWII toddlers talking, lisping adorable little things as she charms one and all.  She luckily is removed a safe place about half way through the book.<br />Finally, the resolution of the plot relies way too much on intuition, coincidence, and a villain who can't keep quiet.  Of course the villain sticks out a mile as well.<br />However, if you like British cozies where spinster detectives knit jumpers and socks as she searchs for clues and is always one step ahead of the police then grab this one.	2004-02-09

Just to get this out of the way-- I don't agree with the conclusions drawn by the author as to who killed Charlie Bravo, but that's half the fun of reading about a classic Victorian domestic homicide.  It's distant enough in time to be an enjoyable intellectual exercise, but not so far that letters and papers are not preserved.  Between the two inquests there is quite a lot-- much of it contradictory-- known about the household at the Priory.<br />Charlie Bravo was the second husband of Florence Campbell.  Her first husband, Alexander Ricardo, had died of drink, but not before settling forty thousand pounds on her.  After Alexander's death she had sought consolation with an old family friend.  After severing that connection, she was courted by Charlie Bravo, a young barrister with wealthy connections who was either a jealous, pinch-penny or a cheerful, considerate young man depending on who was telling the story.  While it is true his step father was a wealthy creole merchant, Charlie also had a disagreement with Florrie about her financial settlement before they were even married.<br />The story of Charlie Bravo's death and the investigation following it make for enteretaining reading, and maybe a hour or two of speculation later with like minded friends.	2004-01-30

There is also a plethora of people who have a reason for wanting to see him dead.<br />Miss Silver in a happy coincidence is visiting an old school chum in the same village; therefore, she is near at hand to use her skills for ferreting out the truth, when a murder does occur.<br />Published not long after the end of WW II, Ms. Wentworth does a better than average job in this particular mystery.

I do enjoy historical mysteries and I thought this one was aces.<br />First, the research was very good and the fruits of that research were very nicely woven into the story.  I had recently read a social history of London's underworld in the early and mid 18th century and I was delighted to be able to identify some of the characters, places and terms she used.  This is also not a time period that is used a lot in the mystery genre currently.<br />Second, I liked the characters.  The author noted that she stared this as a short story which may explain why it doesn't have the depth of exposition that can be expected from a very large book (and the Outlander books are VERY LARGE).  Since this is my first introduction to Lord John, I found him intriguing and interesting.<br />Third, the mystery was unusual and complicated enough to be interesting.  A group of apparently unconnected events turn cat in pan to a rather satisfying conclusion.<br />Clearly the ending was a foreshadowing of something, so I hope that there are going to be more Lord John books in the future.	2004-01-21

By the time this book was published (early 60's?) Miss Silver was only brought on stage in the middle of the book and as sort of a Dues ex Machina.<br />In fact there isn't much mystery here because the author doesn't make any effort to conceal the identity of the murderer.  The only suspense is how the story is going to unwind.<br />The story starts with a hit and run incident that results in the death of Miss Garston.  Miss Garston had in her care Jennifer Hill, a 17 year old girl who was supposed to be the illigitimate daughter of a local land owner who was killed in World War II.  With her dying breath though, Miss Garston reveals that she believed Jennifer's parents were married, which would make Jennifer the heir to the Alington inheritance, not the current estate holders-- Mac Forbes, this widowed mother, and three siblings.<br />Partly a Cindarella story and partly a village mystery (without the mystery) this story meanders its way through gossip, skullduggery and other assorted mayhem.  It's not stunning and it's kind of cliched, but it's readable, particularly if you are in the mood for this type of homely British mystery.	2004-01-20

It's been cynically described as girl gets house because the main characters were a heroine who is usually somehow tied to a sinister and usually palatial home.  <br />In this book the heroine is a recently widowed fashion model.  Her 15 year old step son is left in her care, and their inheritance is an estate on the coast of Portugal.  <br />Elsie Lee had a way of taking cliches and turning them inside out.  Her heroines are rarely helpless or stupid.  The dialogue is spritely and the story moves at a good pace.<br />This one is well worth reading.	2004-01-17

Jocelyn (with the help of Jack Breedlove, a cowboy, hairdresser friend from California who is in Manhattan for a horse show) hooks PJ up with an aggressive little lawyer whose reaction to the geraniums that grow outside the police station is priceless.<br />With hilarious characters and great dialogue (not to mention great blocking) Dentinger puts her characters through their paces.  Because the theatre world does depend a lot on gossip and innuendo, it's not surprising that the case is cracked by using less than usual police procedures.<br />Dentinger just keeps getting better-- and manages to keep her characters fresh because they have such endearing human foibles.  Avoiding the mistake that a lot of authors make of resolving their character's personal issues and then just leaving them with the mysteries, Dentinger keeps the pot boiling in every direction.	2004-01-13

I think this is a ploy that shortchanges the victim and the readers.  The author spends so much time telling us how perfect the victim was that she seems more a plaster csst than a real woman who suffered and died.<br />There was potentially a very powerful story there: the struggle of the family's quest for vengeance (sort of an Old Testament eye for an eye thing) against the defense team who was trying to save the accused from the death penalty with equal passion.  Of course the author spends too much time beatifying one side and demonizing the other to write a really good book.  I found myself feeling somewhat queasy about some of the actions on both sides.  And as someone else complained, there's no explantion as to how these people arrived at the place that led to the tragedy.<br />Finally, I would like someone to tell me that the title means.  Secrets don't lie and they don't tell the truth.  They just are-- and sometimes when they are revealed they cause problems for someone.	2004-01-13

I think it might be an inherent problem with the form.  I think some of the complaints about how Keppel sounds in this book arises from this and not from any personality problems.<br />When talking about the tracking and capture of serial killers, this book is very interesting.  Not groundbreaking, but Keppel does provide some different information about the Wayne Williams case and some of the infighting that went on in the law enforcement community in some of the other cases.<br />The part with Bundy may be of interest to people who want to psychoanalyze Bundy the killer and it's certainly of interest now that we know who the Green River killer was, to see where Bundy was right or wrong.  But I definitely found myself skimming a lot of Bundy's transcript.  Bundy did have one bizarre suggestion involving a film festival, that has to be read to be believed.	2004-01-06

A British author, her website notes that she does research through participation in reenactments of Medieval life.  Having suffered way too much from anachronistic novels, I always grab one of her books with pleasure knowing that her Middle Ages is deeper than wall paper on the computer screen.<br />This book is a multigenerational novel (don't be put off) dealing with the events surrounding the suppression of the Cathars by the Catholic Church in 13th century Languedoc.  However, the author concentrates on the lives of a mother and daughter who stand outside both the Cathar and the Catholic religions, the keeper of a treasure that their family has been guarding down the ages.<br />Because of the connection between the England and France (remember Normandy and the Aquitaine), this inevitably draws in some nobles who also are also well known figures in English history.

The soap opera aspects of their relationships detract from the suspense plot that only picks up when they all go into court near the end.<br />While the author is described as an attorney who later worked with sex offenders, her trial scenes lack a certain feeling of versimilitude.  The ending relies too heavily on the killer losing control. It was really lucky for the police that they never had to take their last case to court because all of their evidence would have probably been thrown out for lack of probable cause in obtaining the warrant... published.	2003-12-28

The series has its ups and downs, but this book is a particular favorite because in this book the whole atevi culture and Bren Cameron's place in it starts to gel.<br />While not action packed and the time period covered by the book is short, a lot happens as Bren makes certain irrevokable decisions that are sure to cause him problems in the future.  The Atevi struggle within their culture to come to some resolution as to how they will interact with humans.  Bren's personal life shifts from his connection with human family, associates and lover to finding a place within Atevi culture.<br />While the pace is slow and the writing dense, this allows the reader to start to feel comfortable in the atevi world and to appreciate the complexities of the culture.  Cherryh has done a very good job of creating a nonhuman culture that touches on enough points to be comprehensible and even attractive but still alien.	2003-12-26

The mystery arises from the death of an actor during the curtain call but the mystery is not the best thing about this book.<br />The best thing about this book is Dentinger's knowledge of actors and acting, directors and directing.  Whether or not actors are really like this, they should be in order not to disappoint their fans.

His nickname was the Gorilla Killer due to the way he was able to overpower grown women and handle the bodies after death.  A better book about this unusual man is Harold Schechter's Bestial.<br />The reason that this book is even as high as an average read is because there has been very little at all written by Nelson in the past few decades.  A cause celebre at the time of the crimes, his reputation has been overwhelmed by more recent killers.<br />The book itself, though, clearly lacks indepth research.  It also has what I consider a major flaw-- making up extended conversations as well as taking us into the mind of the characters. This gives the book a novelistic feel but fails to make it seem more credible.<br />If you have already read Bestial I would suggest giving this book a look to see how another author handles the same material.  I would definitely not suggest that the reader think this to be definitive book about the crimes of Earl Leonard Nelson.	2003-12-06

This book by Norton is a romantic suspense first published in 1979, but it reads like it was written a decade before.  If you have a low tolerance for 20ish heroines who talk and act like they are 40ish and for a plot driven by a Big Misunderstanding then this probably is not the book for you.<br />If, however, you feel a bit nostalgic for a sexless, serial killerless, story then you might well enjoy this foray into the Austen family dirty linen.<br />Not the Jane Austin family but the Austens of Maryland who have enough skeletons to populate all of the closets in their ugly mid Victorian home.<br />Erica Jansen, the heroine, was raised by an elderly aunt who taught her to distrust her own feelings.  Erica's one attempt at freedom resulted in a humiliating incident that sent her running back to Vermont.  Now, five years later, her aunt dead, Erica, a fledgling author, is again in the town where the relationship that ended in her humiliation began.  She runs into a fellow author and by dint of an invitation is drawn into the tangled affairs of the Austen family and their hangers on.<br />Told in first person the books plays out pretty much as you might expect but it's not badly written-- and given a cold, some hot tea and a warm fire, it is a perfectly pleasant comfort read.	2003-11-20

The problem is that it has everything needed for a hardboiled mystery and I'm not real fond of hardboiled mysteries, ...<br />Disaffected former police detective working privately-- check; beautiful woman with a case-- check; Detective is a womanizer-- check; Detective really good at martial arts-- check.  Add betrayal and mix well.  The story breaks with the trend because the detective isn't even an ex-alcoholic.  The pool table seduction scene was definitely over the top though-- way too self conscious and mannered.<br />So, if you like hardboiled detective stories then you might like this book.	2003-11-14

Whether he is dispelling myths about worm eaten corpses or explaining the reason for the distinctive smell of death he is both entertaining and informative.  I was distressed to hear about his death in 1997 because clearly he is the type of expert that is needed in the field of forensic anthropology, one who knows both the lab work and the courtroom. The best expert in the world is useless in a case if he or she cannot convey their knowledge in a way that a jury will understand.<br />He also showed an admirable (but at times frustating) concern for the privacy of the dead and their survivors.	2003-11-13

From an own experience with issues of child abuse I can say from experience that the author is pretty much on the money about 1) the legal system (in certain places and this was published in 1997) and 2) sexual offenders.<br />I am definitely going to search out the other books in this series.<br />The only thing I found somewhat wryly interesting, was that even though the main story is set in the north, why the Southern background of the lead characters in books of this ilk?<br />Kate Scapetta, Clarice Starling, Tempe Brennan, Deborah Knott come to mind at once and I'm sure there are others.  Seems like there is at least a term paper here.	2003-11-12

However, I was very pleased to see Anne Perry back in something like her old form in this book.<br />The parts of the book dealing with Monk's partially recovered memory and Hester's battle to improve the condition of street prostitutes in London are very interesting.  The morally ambiguous position Hester finds herself in provides food for thought.  However, there was something a touch disturbing about the callousness of Monk's deceased mentor toward everyone but Monk and the denoument (while exciting enough) seems a bit cobbled onto the story.<br />The story also relies too much on coincidence.  The person who has the information needed is killed before he can reveal it, the person who needs most to conceal evidence lays hands on it, even after a police search of the premises.  Some coincidence is understandable, but when it starts to take over the plot it becomes annoying.<br />Also, I wish someone could explain the switching system that allowed the wreck the author describes.  It seems that the switch (points in British rail terms) would be against one of the trains and it would have derailed at the switch instead of the wreck happening as she decribed.	2003-11-12

Luckily I also have a weakness for social history because this book is more about the (mainly) London social conditions of the early 18th century than the crimes of the Jack Sheppard and Jonathan Wilde.<br />It was interesting to be reading about the accused Jacobite who spent 30+ years in prison although he was not proved to be a traitor because he would not swear allegiance to the King of England-- Sheer stubbornness?-- at the same time that the Supreme Court has agreed to look at the case of the Guam detainees who have yet to be charged or tried by any legal body.<br /><br />The author makes an argument that Jack Sheppard turned to crime because he was foreclosed from lawfully practicing his trade (carpenter) while Jonathan Wilde utilized a certain genius for organization to create the best organized thieves' gang of the era because that was the only opportunity open to him.  While I am unable to buy her theory wholesale, the tidbits she provides about life in the early 18th century are well worth acquiring.  I would wish that the Hogarth illustrations were larger and clearer but they provide a nice addition to the text.<br />However, I do have questions about the reliability of some of her sources.  A couple of the things she mentioned as fact sound more like pure male fantasy or at best urban legends.<br />Not badly written and not boring.	2003-11-11

Even though in past decades writers have sent a great many famous historical figures off sleuthing after murderers, Lucrezia Borgia has a couple of strikes against her.  One is that the popular image of her as a serial poisoner still lives.  Another is that even if this image was the work of her enemies (as it was) she still lived a very circumscribed life as the daughter of a Pope and the wife of a Duke's heir.<br />However Roberta Gellis has very neatly got around both of these problems.  High born women were watched closely if there was no legitimate heir yet and Gellis does a great job of showing how she could have coped with a life I would describe as claustrophobic.  She places the murder in the Duke's court but also within Lucrezia's sphere.  She further keeps the cast to a manageable size by concentrating on a few trusted companions and servants and keeps the time period where the story occurs into a few days.  Meanwhile there is a sense of urgency because there is always the fear that if she does not act fast her father or her brother might step in to solve her problem (and incidentally make it worse.)<br />This is a very pleasant read, although I do have to say that Lucrezia's relationship with her husband is a little-- well, peculiar, although it's not outside the bounds of possiblity.<br />While it has a satisfying ending there are some loose ends that hopefully will be tied in later books in this seris.	2003-11-02

The alchemical imagery meshes well with the culture that has arisen from the combination of Elizabethan era dessenters and alien culture.  There's also a great sense of the theatrical in the descriptions of the Anubes-- enigmatic natives of the planet where the humans find themselves,  and the great palaces where certain indentured humans labor to provide their alien masters with subtle pleasures.<br />Also there is a darkly humorous take on the traditional gothic novel in the relationship between the lead characters and the situation the heroine discovers herself in for the last part of the novel.  While serious in intent, the author is quite playful in execution of parts of this novel.<br />All in all a definite reading pleasure.	2003-10-29

The only books I have read by these authors to date have been the Anasazi Mysteries-- Visitant, Summoning God and Bone Walker.  In those books there was more of an intrusion by the past on the present and by the present on the past as the authors interwove the stories of the specialists who study the past, the present day Native Americans, and the people who lived at a time of crisis in the Anasazi culture.<br />In this book there is a brief mention of the modern day characters who are more fully fleshed out in the Anasazi Mysteries as they examine an unusual pair of skeletons and associated artifacts found at a dig in New York.<br />This discovery is used as a springboard to tell the story of Iraquoian villages trying to figure out how to survive in proximity to one another.<br />The authors appear to romanticize the Indian cultures but not to the point where I'm rolling my eyes and going &quot;oh, really!&quot; (Anyone who as read an &quot;Indian Romance&quot; knows what I am talking about.)  They do their usual good job of presenting the Native Americans as they would appear to one another.  For instance a tall person is decribed as being so many hands high.  A hand is about four inches.  A quick calculation and you realize that the &quot;tall&quot; person would be considered quite short today.  By using a method of measuring that many of their readers may not be familiar with, they are able to give accurate information without breaking the willing suspension of disbelief.<br />In addition the authors present the differences in their way of life and thought without sensationalizing or demonizing things that many readers would find distasteful in the culture such as the exposure of unwanted children after birth or the use of torture.<br />All in all, well worth reading.	2003-10-23

The Count, a man of many parts-- master of the rapier, crack shot, ingratiating flirt, linguist and gamester-- is thoroughly engaging.<br />The story starts in Rome, where James Farenden has been tossed into gaol following a fracus over a card game in which he was saving a young Englishman, Lord Trevingham from a fleecing.  While there he makes the acquaintance of an elderly Englishman who had been captured by the French.  When Trevingham rescues Farenden he arranges for Mr. Colton's release.  The year is 1814 and Napoleon is in exile on Elba, but his agents are still hoping for his return.<br />Sometime later, Farenden appears in London styling himself as an Italian Count.  Trevingham is delighted to introduce him to polite society, but Constance, Trevingham's sister, has some qualms about the Count's antecedents and future intentions.<br />The Count though is socially adroit and soon has the Trevinghams and their acquaintances dancing to his tune, even as he finds himself having more than a passing interest in a certain young lady.<br />The book is very well written, the plotting in intriguing and the characters engaging.  This should also appeal to Patricia Veryan fans.	2003-10-06

Banks, who is actually two Canadian fantasists named Sean Russell and Ian Dennis, did a very good job recreating a Regency London that might have been.  I think, even if I hadn't read the second novel first and learned their identities, that I would have suspected the author wrote sff for a couple of reasons.<br />First, the ability to bring to life a place that no one now living has ever visited.  World building is the term usually used.  The touchstone for fiction about the Regency era has been the historical writer Georgette Heyer, but she made infrequent forrays into the seamier side of the Regency world in her novels. Banks while having Morton press his nose up the glass and look wistfully inward at the life style that Heyer described, deals with issues like child prostitution from the Regency viewpoint rather than trying to impose a modern sensibility.  His use of Regency cant is effective and not overdone.<br />Second Henry Morton is a hero in the classical sense.  In an effort to mock him another Runner refers to him as Sir Galahad, but it's not far from the truth.  However, he does have his human foibles-- for instance, setting himself up as a ha'penny gentleman, a wannabe in modern terms, even employing the discarded valet of a nobleman.  Sff is one of the few areas of fiction where heroes remain heroic and rarely fall into whining introspection. (Not that I'm against introspection, it's the whining I dislike.)<br />Another thing I really like about this book is Morton's mistress.  This is one of the few female characters I have run into recently in any genre novel who has her own concerns and pursues them without regard to the hero's sensibilities.<br />I've deliberately tried to talk about characters and setting because I don't want to give any of the plot away.  It is actually two plots that neatly twine together in the end as Morton is hired to kind the killer of a young gentleman and is himself stalked by a ruthless force.<br />This is not a book to inspire Deep Thoughts but it is a book that is entertaining and well repays reading.

If the whole point of this book is to show fans of Regency romances that the heroes they enjoy in their books would be dead bores in their living room, I would have to say the author succeeded.  However, St. Just is also a dead bore as a fictional character come to life in a contemporary mystery.<br />I was rather intrigued by the premise in a 60's sitcom sort of way (think of My Favorite Martian or, better, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir) but the execution fell flat.  While it doesn't surprise me that St. Just (the aristocratic Regency detective come alive) is rather two dimensional, the fact that all of the other characters are caricatures really destroyed any enjoyment I might have wrung from the situation.  The gay, African-American doorman (with an impressive appendage); the hard drinking, tough talking editor with a bit of a marshmellow center; the conventional agent with shark teeth when it comes to a contract; the fan who only reads the books for their sexual content; and the self centered former boyfriend who is trying to rewoo the previous object of his affection.  These are all too familiar and Casey does nothing to bring them to life.<br />Then smack in the middle of the book the author makes an error about a will that turns the rest of the plot and probably the plot of the book to come into a dog's dinner.  There's a fact about wills and divorce that every divorced person should know but evidently Ms. Casey doesn't.<br />This one is not worth the effort.	2003-09-22

I have to admit that this my introduction to the story of Henry Morton, Bow Street Runner, but I quite enjoyed it.  The period is one that is frequently used in genre fiction and I would have sworn that there was very little I did not know about the time, but the authors managed to surprise me.<br />The center of the plot that creates the mystery is barely glimpsed at the beginning of the book, the short, stout dethroned emporer of the French.  Around his head swirls plots and counter plots as the British debate exactly what to do with him.  He is in legal limbo.  If he should set foot on English soil he could claim the benefit of English law and the English also do not have any reason to execute him.  While he caused the death of thousands, he has committed no capital crime.  (Ironies of ironies, though, if he had stolen an item worth 40 pounds or more, he could have been executed as a felon.)<br />The action is quite brisk and vivid.  The reactions of the characters are humane yet they do not display too modern a sensibility.  I sincerely hope that this series continues.	2003-09-18

Schechter is one of my favorite writers of historical true crime.  He gives enough detail to place the murders in historical prospective, but doesn't go overboard.  In this case he opens the book with a synopsis of a crime of the late 20th century then goes on to discuss a crime that occured in the late 1870's, twenty years before the events that form the core of the book.  Both of these crimes help to illuminate the story of Jolly Jane Toppan, a popular nurse, whose surviving patients could not believe the accusations leveled against her.<br />The author also has a theory about the difference between female and male serial killers.  I'm not sure I totally buy it but it is something to think about.<br />Anyway, this book is riveting.  The background of the characters is well developed and researched.  It also will you give you pause the next time a nurse hands you a paper cup with a bunch of little anonymous pills in it.  &quot;Take your medicine, it's good for you.&quot;	2003-09-17

However, I picked it up again after reading a paper titled \\"150 Years of Mary Sue\\" and found more enteratinment in analyzing why the story does not work than I did in the story.  Mary Sue or Marty Sue (for the male version) was first given an identity in media fan fiction.  She is usually an avatar for the author in the story.  If female she is incredibly gifted, attractive and successful.  She overcomes horrendous odds in reaching her goal. Sometimes this works, this time it doesn't.<br />How does Arden fit the Mary Sue stereotype?  Well (and this this backstory not a spoiler), she is raised as the only female in a monastary after her father's death.  The Abbott becomes a second father to her and she is taught both meditative techniques and martial arts.  Everyone at the monastary just loves her. After leaving the monastary she becomes the first female in the Imperial Guard and the bodyguard to princess Jessa.<br />Arden of course is also psychic, armed with just her katana, she sucessfully fights off repeated attacks by trained assassins, and manages to make a couple of guys fall in love with her.<br />When the book begins Princess Jessa is escaping from the planet of Glory because she fears to share her mother's fate if she remains. Jessa's mother, the Emperor's concubine, is addicted to a substance called Live Weave.  Arden gives herself up as soon as Jessa is gone and is imprisoned for six years which gives her a chance to practice her meditation and something that sounds like Tae Bo.  She was sentenced to execution soon after her capture, but somehow the people in charge never got around to doing it.  Now they need Jessa back and Arden is the person they want to send after her.<br />Mary Sue?  You bet.  Probably the author should be cut some slack if this was her first book but this is about her fourth so there's no mercy on that score.<br />Recommendation:  Don't bother.	2003-09-09

He is trying to recreate the period just after the end of World War I when Britain was adjusting to the momentous changes forced on it by the war inasfar as it aids in the story that Todd is telling.<br />Todd's interest is in the effect of the war on the individual and society as played out in the homicide career of Ian Rutledge.  The over-riding story arc involves Rutledge's antagonist at Scotland Yard who is trying to set Rutledge up for a fall.  This is not a spoiler because it is revealed very early in the book.  This specific story is about the murder of a local landowner who seemed to have no enemies, although he had recently quarreled with his ward's fiance, a war hero high in the esteem of the nation and the Royal Family.  This political hot potato is tossed to Rutledge to resolve.  Failure could mean the end of his career.  Success could mean the end of his career.<br />For those who think that the sexual frankness of some of the characters in this book is out of period, they need to look at the social history of the time rather than what one thinks the social history is.  Remember Lady Chatterley's Lover and the Well of Loneliness were both published in this decade.  And even though both of the books were pronounced obscene, they were still gobbled up by the reading public.<br />Although his prose is at times gothic and overwrought, Todd also floats some very interesting ideas.  The series clearly, at this stage at least is worth following.	2003-09-04

But I was young and impressionable when I read it and it stood miles above the average paperback gothic of the period.<br />The beginning is similar to that of Crocodile on the Sandbank, the book that later began her Amelia Peabody Emerson series.  Her scholarly father dead, the heroine is setting out to make her own way in the world.  However Master of Blacktower runs a more traditional course with a scarred employer whose reputation is not of the best, a remote Medieval pile in Scotland, not to mention, a missing (dead?) wife, sinister retainers and a mentally disturbed child (what happened to all of those traumatized children when they grew up?).  However Michaels' irrepressible humor shines through at times.  The predictable plot takes some nice twists and turns.  The climax in a dangerous snowy landscape is nicely done.<br />All in all-- not to be sneezed at.	2003-08-31

It has a very slow beginning. The impoverished Jeffrey Wynne is returning a young lady from France to her uncle, Sir Mortimer. Their way lies across London Bridge, but they discover that a military guard has been set on the bridge. The houses that line both sides of the bridge from time out of mind are to be torn down to allow more room for vehicular traffic. The guard has been set to prevent those who had lived there, by that time the very poor, from creeping back into their homes.  After some rather puzzling noodling around Jeffrey and Peg end up back at a house on London Bridge at the sign of the Magic Pen where a locked room mystery of a sort is waiting for them.<br />Carr's writing is a fair copy of mediocre mid 18th century prose. He has done his homework because he tells the reader more about the minituae of 18th century life than the reader probably wants to know. The reader is also introduced to John Fielding, Magistrate of Bow Street (better known from Bruce Alexander's more recent mystery series) and Laurence Stern (libidinous parson and author of Tristam Shandy among other works).<br />I ended up wanting to shake both the heroine and the hero. The heroine keeps running headlong into danger in the TSTL (Too Stupid to Live)fashion of heroines in older historicals and the hero isn't particularly nice. The fight scenes are so precisely described that the reader will have to stop and picture what they are doing, which slows the pace even more.<br />You might want to avoid this book if you are not a fan of JDC or the mid 18th century.	2003-08-23

At times it reads like a cozy with a large cast of senior citizens, at times it reads like the Southwestern version of Joan Hess' Maggody novels and at times it reads like police procedural. At all times it is just too disorganized and messy.<br />An elderly neighbor of detective Elena Jarvis' is shot during a daylight robbery while his wife was playing bridge at a local Senior Citizens center.  The new widow makes no bones about the fact that she is happy that he was dead.  The opinion of her friends was that he was an abusive spouse who had pushed his wife down the stairs and broke her hip during one of his air raid drills.  (In preparation for the resurgence of Communism he expected any minute.)  Suspicion immediately falls on his son, Lance, who was forbidden the house because he was gay.  Additionally the police start taking a good hard look at her two admires, Omar Ashkinazi, a retired rug dealer who makes no secret of his feelings for the widow and T. Bob, a retired rancher who was her dance partner before the injury.<br />Add to this mix Elena's mother, a former flower child named Harmony, who cannot resist meddling in Elena's life (and any possible political demonstration on offer); Elena's partner who is a tap dancer who decides to organize a Tap Night in the middle of a murder investigation; and Elena's ex-husband who is a potential abuser as well as a few other murders and the poor reader's head swims.<br />While not downright terrible-- I did finish it, I don't think I would have read it had I known how messy it was.  The characters were caricatures (which of itself isn't bad) but the combination of the serious substance matter and the shenanigans of the characters grates. I think this one is for completist fans of the Elena Jarvis series only.	2003-08-16

But the men who returned home were not the same men who left and the family and friends they returned to had borne their own share of losses.<br />Todd evocatively lays out the story of Ian Rutledge who has returned to his job in Scotland Yard, but finds wherever he turns more human wreckage from the War that shattered his own life and left him with an unseen companion whose distinctive voice haunts his days, a bit of his soul broken off and speaking to him in the voice of a dead man.<br />This novel opens with the the story of another shell shocked veteran, Mowbray, and the body of a woman who may be his wife.  At least it would be convenient for the local Police officials if it were his wife.  Rutledge is brought in to try to find Mowbray's two children-- it being feared that he has also killed them as well.<br />However all is not as it appears and the tragedy grows darker as Rutledge digs deeper into the lives of the inhabitants of the community.<br />This book is infused with a powerful sense of compassion.  It's very well written and deals with a subject that is timely but also timeless.<br />Very highly recommended.	2003-07-31
US	51741466	RSXYS9NWG4ZY	0515077402	71867237	Winter Song	Books	5	24	25	N	N	Ms Gellis Does It Again	In the previous book circumstances had thrown together Raymond of Aix, nephew by marriage to the King of England and Alys of Marlowe, the daughter of an English Knight.  Raymond, fleeing from his mother's smothering affection, is enchanted by Alys' good sense and competence.  Now, despite the difference between their social positions, Raymond is determined to have Alys for his wife.<br />Change the names and this could probably describe hundreds of second rate romances.  But there is nothing second rate about Roberta Gellis.  And the book is not about the wooing and winning, but what happens after the marriage is made.<br />Alys has to deal with a difficult mother-in-law, a venal bailiff and a tricky politcal situation. She also has to deal with her own fears that she cannot live up to Raymond's social status.  Raymond's mother lives a life of idleness that Alys takes to be the usual role of noblewomen.  Alys, however, is far to competent and lively to dwindle into a mere noblewoman.<br />As always, it is a pleasure to see Ms. Gellis deal with the medieval mindset.  There's no misplaced 20th century sentimentality.  If her characters are somewhat softer than the history of the period would suggest was usual, it is always for a good, logical reason in keeping with the thought of the times.<br />This one is not an easy book to find but well worth the search.	2003-07-29

I can't say a lot about this without giving information away but readers need to watch for her use of a well and a septic tank to parallel and heighten this story about the deaths of mothers and children.  There is also a nice connection between the reason for the deaths of the victims of the death squad and the more recent victim she is called on to excavate and examine.<br />The reader is going to learn more than she ever wanted to know about the inner workings of a septic tank.<br />All in all well worth reading even if not as tightly plotted as some of her previous books.<br />Also, it appears that her personal life may be moving forward a bit with the introduction of a second possible romantic interest although coincidence is stretched a bit thin.	2003-07-23

I'm not disrecommending(what a dreadful word) this book.  It's better than a lot of fiction out there, but I didn't think this book was the best thing for vampires since the invention of the blood bank.  It's not bad, which is why I put my rating in the middle, but the plotting is definitely lackluster and the protagonists are too predictable.<br />What I liked-- the villains.  Rashad is far more interesting than the male protagonist.  A creature of wit, style and sentiment.  You wouldn't catch Rashad drinking himself into a stupor.  The villains are more complex than the protagonists, more three dimensional, and have the added fillip of doing bad things for a reason, not just being evil because the author needed some evil villains.<br />The concept of the Noble Dead.  I don't know if this is original with the authors or they picked it up somewhere, but it's a nice term that resonates with some of the other terms used to describe dangerous creatures that we don't want to offend.<br />The part I wasn't particularly interested in: First, the reader who doesn't know where the series is going is very new to vampire fiction.  The title gives that away.<br />Second the protagonists are ok but don't particularly compel interest:  Young female with a mysterious background who ran away from home at an early age with mystic items left for her by her missing father of significantly higher social status-- Young half elf who drinks to forget his tormented past (but we are told all about it 3/4 of the way through the book). The dream of the female half of this odd partnership is to settle down in a real home.<br />So they try to settle down and that's when things get really dangerous.<br />The quest is a mainstay of adventure stories but it has to shine hard and bright not soft and soggy as a stale cookie. I'm going to buy the second in this series just to see if the authors manage to pull things together in their next book.	2003-07-23

I could not give this book one star because I really admire someone who goes after a theory they way Cornwell goes after this one.  Having survived the theories about Frances Tumblety, Maybrick and even Lewis Carroll(Really that one is weaker than the one against Sickert)I am always up for another stab at the game of who is Jack.<br />However, I really wish it had been Kate on the quest and not Cornwell herself.  I'm sure Kate would have realized that the people in Britain had seen an American with deep pockets coming.  I have no idea how much she was taken for in purchasing all her ripper (and Sickert) memorabilia but I'm sure it was a packet.  At least it's tax deductible and she can problably sell it on eBay if she gets tired of it for more than she paid.<br />Second point, I think this book is disorganized, but I think it is deliberately disorganized.  The easiest way to pad a weak case is by muddling in a lot of other stuff.  The more you can distract the reader with extraneous points, the less they can recognize the weak points of an argument.<br />Finally, I think that there was an interesting idea at the center of this case.  It just got lost in the author driving the point home about Sickert.  On one hand,It might have been very interesting if Cornwell had written a book about her actual search for information, the qualifications of her experts and how they worked.  On the other she might have turned it into a compelling piece of fiction.  As it is, the book sort of drags in the middle but it's readable if the reader doesn't mind rolling her eyes occasionally	2003-07-17

This is the story about how little Molly Challans (with her love of cowboys and books) because the best selling author of historical novels set in both Bronze age and Classical Greece, Mary Renault.<br />One might almost have predicted the loveless marriage that produced her.  Her mother's least attractive qualities seem to resonate in the character of Olympias (Alexander the Great's mother)in her later series (written after her mother's death and final betrayal).  The absent or ineffective fathers in her books reflect her other father's physical and emotional distance from his family.<br />And around her momentous events of the 20th century occur-- World War I and II, the rise of the Nationalist Party in South Africa, the liberalization of sexual mores in Britain and the United States, and the struggle against appartheid.<br />This linear story is probably where the reader should go who wants to know more concrete facts about Mary Renault's life (she pronounced it Ren-olt not like the car).  The author at times dips into analysis but doesn't linger there.  His main informant seems to have been Mary's lifelong companion, Julia and at times the book seems to be as much about Julia as Mary-- he notes at one point that a friend referred to them as M & J rather than separately.<br />I'm still waiting for the definitve evaluation of Renault's novels but until it arrives this book is well worth reading if at times a little on the thin side.	2003-06-30

Compelled to explore, they discover that it is a door into a bubble in time.<br />While Norton's books for younger readers tend to be more didactic than her books for young (and old!) adults, she makes an effort to include touches that her older readers would appreciate and enjoy.  In this book which deals with magic, mystery and time travel, she tucks in a message about tolerance and accepting responsibility for one's actions.  She also does not provide a pat happy ending (which children often see through and reject in books meant for them) but she does offer hope to her young characters that their situation would improve.	2003-06-22

The plane was carrying mostly college students.  The crash site is horrific.  The demands, physical, mental and emotional on the crash site investigators is horrendous.  Then she finds a body part that belongs to no one in the crash, and discovers that there is someone who wants her off the case permanently.<br />I'm not sure I buy all of the details of the conclusion, but that was an afterthough.  While I reading it this was a fast paced and gripping story-- but not accompanying a rare steak.	2003-06-21

The Surgeon was a slam\bang, toe curling horror story (in the nonsupernatural sense) about a man who preyed on emotionally damaged women.<br />Tucked securely into prison, the Surgeon still dreams of the one who got away.  Meanwhile, a predator is stalking couples in upscale homes, but using the Surgeon's signature.  Drawn into this case by its similarities of her investigation the summer before, Jane Rizzio, homicide detective, has further problems in the form of an FBI agent who mysteriously appears and questions her ability to handle the case.<br />Jane's problems with her co-workers and her family are shown in a few choice scenes. Gerritsen is very good at fleshing out her characters this way.<br />However, the reason I feel the book lost focus was because Gerritsen's past as a romance writer seemed to come back to haunt her here. A bit of tension about the love interest's role in the deaths might have spiced up the story. Anxiety about an ending helps in a suspense novel. The resolution of that seemed a bit pat and the final ending actually seems a little anticlimactic.<br />All in all, not the same punch as the Surgeon but still a better than average read and I'm forward to her next effort.	2003-06-19

I was surprised to realize that many of the books read like straight mysteries or suspense novels even if they were labeled romantic suspense or the cover blurb emphasized the romance aspect.<br />This one in particular is a woman in jeopardy story that would have made a pretty good movie.<br />Antonia Moncrieff is an editor working for a New York publishing house that is trying to fight its way back into the big time.  Her boss has found an former Big Author (former Pulitzer Prize Winner) who has been out of circulation for a number of years due to a history of alcohol abuse culminating in a tragic accident.  After years as a recluse the Big Author is ready to publish his third novel which both Antonio and her boss anticipate will be quite a blockbuster. However, her boss does not know that Antonia has some history with the famous author.  At the time they had known each other she was known as Mary Leigh, her married name.<br />Antonio has just received an unexpected inheritance, an old brownstone in Brooklyn Heights.  It's desperately in need of repair and her first impulse is to sell it.  However, her young son, Ewan, convinces her that they should rehab the house and live in it.  There's also a basement apartment that her boss talks her into renting to the Big Author.<br />Then MYSTERIOUS THINGS start to HAPPEN.<br />I'm not sure why the book still works as well as it does for me.  It has a couple of themes that I generally don't like in contemporary books-- and can only buy because the book was originally published in the 70's and I can remember what things were like then and earlier.  The writing and language are not dated and the characterization, while a little over the top is consistent and believable.<br />All in all well worth a reread.	2003-06-11

Sometimes Thea Devine has written some great erotic romances, sometimes she totally misses the boat.  In this case she is standing on the dock as the boat pulls out of sight.<br />The hero in this case, Dar, is asked to take the place of a dying man, Ducas Sangbourne, who just happens to be his double.  The reason for this masquerade involves the hunt for a traitor, but this seems to be just an excuse for the writer to plop Dar down in the middle of Ducas' life, including his realtionship with Angene, who is determined to become Ducas' mistress for no clear reason.<br />Things are very lively at the Sangbourne estate (get the name?) with the older Sangbournes arranging happy little sexual swapmeets.  Then who should turn up but Ducas.  That's when things go from merely being vague to downright confusing.  Ducas, you see, is a vampire of the evil sort-- hardly a spoiler.  He and Dar engage in a round of identity swapping and battling that is never adequately described or explained.  It would have been nice if someone had just sat down and told the reader what is going on in the book.<br />So it's an erotic vampire romance that is not particularly erotic or romantic but does have some vampires.  One out of three is not good.	2003-06-08

I've never been the victim of s sexual assault, never had a prowler come through my window at night, never been helpless in a harrowing situation-- but these are all fears that women live with every day.  Gerritsen drags them into the light of day with this book.  The very idea that there is a specific word to describe sexual excitation caused by stabbing a knife into flesh is creepy.<br />On one end of the spectrum in this book is Catherine Cordell, a successful surgeon, on the other is Jane Rizzoli, a female homicide detective who is struggling for recognition in her own field. Between them is a serial killer who preys on wounded and vulnerable women.<br />Gerritsen has put far more thought into this book than is normally done with a serial killer story.  My reaction to it was rather like my reaction first to reading Red Dragon-- Scary, even repulsive at times but I couldn't put it down.  She has managed to find a fresh take on an overused plot.	2003-06-05

Therefore, when a young, unmarried baronet takes up residence on his family estate it naturally causes a great stir among the mamas of eligible young ladies.<br />Meanwhile, girls working in the local mill are falling ill at an alarming rate.  Their condition is diagnosed by the local doctor as chlorosis or &quot;green sickness.&quot;  They become weak and tired and eventually can no longer work.  A second doctor, William Praisegood, comes down from London to investigate this peculiar outbreak and the mill owner cooperates, seeing a way to find out what is troubling his employees without paying a penny.<br />Sounds like the start of a bad vampire film, doesn't it?  But it's not.  It's the beginning of an entertaining book with a bit of romance and more than a bit of black humor.  It's a combination mystery novel (not a really impressive mystery)and comedy of manners.  The Portlands, a wealthy manufacturer's family have two daughters, the stunning Guenevere and the practical and intelligent Elaine.  There is also an impoverished orphaned niece, Violet Webb, who resides with them.  Violet, who has a scientific bent, finds herself drawn into Dr. Praisegood's efforts at tracking down the cause of the disease afflicting the mill workers.<br />When Sir Geoffrey arrives Mrs. Portland immediately begins to make plans to marry Guenevere into the aristocracy despite the Baronet's rumored ill health.  Guenevere thinks this is a fine plan.  Elaine and Violet, on the other hand. try to curb their mother's and sister's worse excesses.<br />I recommend this book highly for those who enjoy a good social comedy and a vampire story together.  It's very well researched and true to period.	2003-05-25

Despite a careful investigation into their disppearance by the authorities no trace was ever found.  Aurora decides that she is going to find the Julius family.<br />On the personal side, though, she is also finding out some things about her future husband that make her more than a bit uneasy.  Then Martin tells her that he a friend from Vietnam who has lost his job in Florida and will be staying in their garage apartment.  When she meets the Youngbloods she knows that Martin is not being completely open with her.<br />There's a satisfactory resolution of the story but as with many literary villains, much of the detail comes out only because the evil person, once immobilized, cannot keep their mouth shut.  However, Harris has created a page turner as the focus moves from Aurora's less than idyllic personal life to the puzzle of what happened to the former owners of her home.	2003-05-20

Ok, this is not the best book by Charlaine Harris I have read but I really have to admire her daring.  I have read so many authors-- best selling genre authors,too, state that they would like to write something different but darnnit their editors won't let them because it might upset their fans.  So some series continue down the same paths dragging all of the baggage with them.  Other series just relegate the boring significant other to the background.<br />I think we can see here that the editors are partly right, some people are going to be upset, but it appears an equal number are willing to go along for the ride.  This book is well written, well plotted, and well worth reading.<br />The Aurora Teagarden books have always been something tougher disguised as cozies.  In the first book in the series the author went to some trouble to show the difference between the intellectual pursuit of true crime and the reality of murder in your own back yard.  While not as dark as her Lily Bard books apparently her use of humor lulled some readers into thinking the author was a harmless cozy writer.<br />Then BANG, she jumped out from behind a door and stuck a pin in a balloon.

The one I enjoyed the most was Simeon's Bride.<br />Second, I enjoyed this book immensely.<br />Dominated by the scenery of the moors north of Manchester, the same scenery that supposedly inspired Ian Brady and Myra Hindley to murder, the small village of Haughton is rocked when the body of young woman is found in her burning house.  Her brutally abusive ex-husband is convicted of the murder and sent to prison.  Then evidence appears that does not just suggest that her husband was innocent, but which implicates the police in a frame up of the convicted man.<br />Michael Mckenna and his group and brought in to investigate the police who are implicated in this miscarriage of justice.  But was it a miscarriage?  From the reporter who is more interested in selling papers than relating the truth, to the town's reformed bad girl who just wants to put her past behind her to the charismatic, handsome priest who is a major witness, the characters are riveting.  The author has been a social worker and her knowledge of the dark corners of human society is obvious here.<br />The focus in this story is not so much on McKenna and his group who mainly act as a catalyst, but on the inhabitants of Haughton and the pain they inflict on one another and themselves.	2003-05-17

He had also fallen desperately in love with her.<br />However Barbara was already married to a friend of his and Alphonse is too honorable to engage her in an affair.  When Barbara's husband dies unexpectedly and Barbara recoils from the men who seek her as a bride because of her wealth, Alphonse withdraws from temptation to Aix.<br />Now it is ten years later.  The Barons of England are in revolt.  Queen Eleanor is in France trying to secure support for her husband.  Among those of Henry's supporters who have fled to France is Barbara's uncle.  And Barbara is sent as her father's emissary with news of his wife, children and estates.  There, she and Alphonse meet again.<br />Played out against the politics of the era, the story of Barbara and Alphonse is engrossing reading.  This is one of Gellis' stronger historical novels. The characters are interesting and the conclusion satisfying.	2003-05-07

On one hand, I don't have any particular emotional attachment to whether or not Mary, Queen of Scots, was involved in her abusive husband's death-- I'd probably think more of her if she had been. On the other hand, there is a lot of criticism of Alison Weir's historical research.<br />I honestly suggest that if you like an interesting bit of popular history speculation about an odd (if ultimately significant) event in Scottish history that this book can provide a few diverting hours.  There's also extensive footnotes and a bibliography if you want to check her sources and draw your own conclusions.<br />Personally, I always liked the theory that Elizabeth I dangled Darnley in front of Mary knowing she would snap at such attractive bait and end up with a weak and dissolute husband, who would keep the political situation in Scotland in turmoil and the power effectively in the hands of Mary's Protestant advisers.  Weir discusses the various aspects of the negotiations between Elizabeth and Mary about Mary's marriage but doesn't plump down on one side or the other of this theory--of course that's only a sidelight of a very complex political and religious situation.<br />So if you aren't emotionally attached already to a theory about Darnley's death or Mary's personality and you have a few hours to spend reading, this would be a pleasant book to pass the time with.	2003-04-17

It was one of Norton's few short stories, therefore, to be highly prized. Later it appeared in a DAW collection called the Many Worlds of Andre Norton (1974). Here (1976) it appears with a sequel that ties up the loose ends left at the end of Toys.<br />The remaining stories appear here for the first time and are all worth reading. This isn't the best Norton has done, but even mediocre Norton is very good indeed.	2003-04-06

The men who are coming home have come, Prohibition is in place.  Women have the Vote, bob their hair and are trying all of the new freedoms open to them including the right to pursue casual sexual liasons.<br />Olivia's fiancee died in the War, her remaining family killed by the influenza, finds herself the possessor of a house in Greenwich Village that had belonged to her Great Aunt Vangie.  There she resides with her maid Mattie and her downstairs tenant, Harry Melville, a private investigator.  She writes poetry successfully, drinks and smokes to excess and enjoys men with an almost frenzied heedlessness.<br />But one day while on the way to meet with some of her other friends she discovers a body lying in pool of water in the street.  In the days that follow she receives threatening messages, Harry is beaten up in an alley and, as she tries to discover what is happening, a trail of deaths follow her.<br />There's one annoying moment when Olivia has a lapse of intelligence, other than that, the book does a good job of creating a believable picture of Jazz Age Greenwich village, from it's Irish gangsters to the Provincetown Players.	2003-04-04

It's a favorite way to get two individuals into proximity without too much work.  Usually the reason for the masquerade is quickly forgotten and the snogging begins.  However, Patricia Briggs uses this device instead to worm her engaging thief/mage into the Court and the company of the Reeve.<br />Bad things are happening at the Court and the Reeeve needs someone with Mage talent to help him ferret out the source of the trouble.  Sham, who has her own agenda based on her past, agrees to masquerade as the Reeve's mistress in order to be brought inside the Court.  During the masquerade she has to deal with the Reeve's mother, his best friends widow and assorted mysterious happenings.<br />The one sour note I mentions above happens late in the story and if the reader doesn't see it coming then the reader is asleep at the wheel.  It does get the heroine where the author needs her to be but it definitely could have been better handled.  However, after that misstep the book picks up and wends its way to a satisfying climax.<br />A happy combination of romance, politics and magery.	2003-03-26

A couple of chapters later I found myself wondering if I needed to clean my gutters out.<br />Since neither paint nor gutters appear prominently in this book, the only conclusion I could draw was-- I was bored. I ended up finishing the book when stopped by a train and it was the only book I had in the car.<br />Here's the good: It's not badly written at all. One of the authors writes the China Bayliss mysteries which I have read and enjoyed, so the writing is smooth and professional.<br />The information on horse doping was new to me and appeared well researched.<br />Here's the bad: I felt as though the characters lacked depth. Charles (I think he started the series as Sir Charles but I must have missed something after that) is egalitarian (doesn't want to use his title), supportive of his wife having a career as a writer, and interested in science. The reader would not guess that he had ever held any other views or struggled to arrive at the views. The just appear full blown.  Kate, his American wife, supports women's sufferage, writes succesful novels and has set up a school to teach women agriculture. She also never seems to question her ideas or wonder if what she is doing is best for the objects of her charity.<br />They have one friend who supports Cecil Rhodes' policy in Africa, but I'm sure he will see the error of his ways. All of the other members of the nobility and gentility are potrayed as corrupt and venal. This is just too easy for the modern reader. It affirms the current beliefs in these areas and never asks us to examine whether or not the beliefs of that era had any value.<br />Also there are numerous errors in the titles used in the story.  Lord Charles (and Lady Charles for his wife) are honorific titles for the younger sons of Dukes and Marquesses and their wives.  Charles's proper title would have been Lord Somerset and Kate would be Lady Somerset.  It's stated he doesn't want to use the title (prefers Sheridan) but it still wouldn't be proper to address him as \\"Lord Charles Sheridan.\\"  If he properly renounced the title he would be simply Mr. Charles Sheridan.<br />I guess it might be possible to just say it's meant to be light entertainment and shrug off any criticism that way, but it has to have some quality that engages the interest of the reader before it can entertain.d their wives.

They are here published in one volume for the first time.<br />Naill Renfro is an inhabitant of the vast refugee camp/slum called the Dipple that developed on the pleasure planet of Kowar after the late war. It has become the source of cheap, desperate labor for the rest of the universe. Renfro was the son of a Free Trader who died with his ship during a fire fight.  Ejected with his mother in a lifeboat they came to the Dipple as refugees, but even with the war ended they have no hope of escape.<br />His mother dying, Naill sells his body as contract labor on an agricultural planet known as Janus to buy her some peace at the end. Naill is shipped in cold sleep to the planet where his contract is purchased by one of the settlers, a member of a dour religious group who are tearing up the great forest of Janus in order to plant their cash crop.  Again it seems Naill is in a trap with no means of escape.<br />Before saving the rain forest became fashionable, Norton wrote about the consequences of losing contact with nature.  In this story there are forces on the planet that are trying to reestablish relationships between the Terrans and the planet by changing the Terrans as the Terrans try to change the planet to meet their needs.<br />This is prime Norton fiction and very entertaining.	2003-03-13

What's wrong with Gen-Xers? (The co-authors are both Boomers.) Then I remembered that this series was geared toward adolescents (that, folks, is why there is no explicit sex but lots of gory violence-- violence being much better for children than sex.)<br />The first of the books in this series was published circa 1990. It combined the Urban Fantasy concept (which dealt a lot with street people, music, elves and magic) with a touch of \\"let's save the kids.\\" What has happened at least in this book is that the message has taken over. Some people have wondered about Eric returning to Julliard after vowing never to go back. Think public service message: If you are in school, stay there; if you've quit, go back. Yep, that's the reason. It also give the authors a chance to show some emotional abuse by parents and teachers. There's also an antidrinking and drug message that stands out about a mile. The general preachiness got to me about the time Eric meets the Guardians. I went and got a drink (of water)and took a handful of pills-- asprin.<br />The protagonists in this book remain rather flat and uninteresting-- and there is a tendency to use way too many brand names. I also don't need the detailed descriptions of what the characters are wearing. It must be padding because the plot is definitely on the thin side. Also, what was trendy when the book was written- 1999-2000? publication date was 2001-- hasn't stayed trendy.<br />Anyway, it's a standard evil drug lord tries to take over the city plot. Everyone but the evil drug lord is evil because of what happened to them in the past-- even the evil sidhe. The drug lord apparently doesn't have a past. Some characters from previous books pop up and leave. There's a gargoyle with a fake Irish accent that's very grating. \\"Laddybuck\\" and \\"Boyo's\\" abound. Also a cop who starts using the phrase \\"take a bullet\\" and soon every one is ready to \\"take a bullet.\\"<br />The authors can write better than this, I wish they would.a gargoyle with a fake Irish accent that's very grating. \\"Laddybuck\\" and \\"Boyo's\\" abound.

If it sounds like so much gobbilty gook then you are in a for a bigger treat-- welcome to the far future world of Andre Norton.<br />Humanity has spread out to the stars like fluff blown from a dandelion head. Terrans have met alien races, been exposed to alien suns, and mutated until it is hard to say what the original stock was.<br />Ziantha, the heroine of Forerunner Foray, is Terran to the eye, but she has a wild talent that makes her both feared and valued. She has psychic abilities that first draw her to a chance seen artifact in a room where she is engaged in some highly illegal activity. Unable to forget the item, she later aports it from the apartment with the aid of an alien \\"pet\\", kept by Ziantha's employer, much as Ziantha herself is kept. This release of power is noted by a prowling sensitive.<br />This event is noted by Lady Yasa's superiors and she is warned to disappear for a while.  This fits in very well with the Salariki's own plans for Ziantha.<br />This book gives a closer look at the underworld of the future, including the mysterious Waystar, an outlaw hideout. There is also an interesting adventure story as Ziantha and her puruser are drawn into the past of the source of the Forerunner artifact.<br />There are some darker themes played out in this story but it's also good space opera and better than average Norton, which is very good indeed.	2003-03-06

The enthusiastic reaction proved them wrong and helped to open the world of science fiction to a legion of women, among them many current science fiction authors.<br />Charis begins her story on a planet where a group of narrow relgious conservatives have taken over.  She was fleeing from the settlement when a space ship planets.  However, the way off the planet the ship offers is as contract labor, a hair away from outright slavery.  Desperate, Charis agrees.  She is taken to the planet of Warlock as part of a trading post, a small experiment to see if Terrans and Wyverns, as the natives of Warlock are called, can peacefully trade.<br />However, there is more going on than a trading mission.  Charis finds herself caught up in a struggle between hijackers and the native rulers.  She also meets up with Shan Lantree, the Planet Survey Cadet assigned to the small Embassy Post as well as Shan's nonhuman wolverine companion, and a small lovable native animal called a curl cat.<br />This is vintage Norton and well worth reading.	2003-03-04

Reared in the Dumps of Tyr, he fought his way into a laboring position as a caretaker for a pair mutant wolverines used by Survey in exploring the planet of Warlock. This precarious toe-hold on respectability was threatened by the malice of Garth Thorvald, a young cadet. However, Garth's malicious action in releasing the wolverines led to Lantee being absent from the camp hunting them when the insect like Throgs (aliens with whom the Terrans cannot find common meeting ground and so they fight a war of running skirmishes) attacked and destroyed it.<br />Heading away from the camp, Lantee chances upon a downed space ship and meets up with Garth's older brother, who had been off world an effort to slow down colonization of Warlock.<br />The two begin a fantastic adventure as they cross the vividly described countryside, pulled by a compulsion that cannot be explained, while dodging Throgs and natural threats.<br />This books definitely bears reading and rereading. I may like it even more now, than it did nearly forty years ago.	2003-03-03

The thing that really saves this book from being dated though is Norton's distrust of all big government.<br />The US team was sent into space under Redax, a conditioning that returns their thought processes to that of their ancestors-- Apaches living in the late 18th and 19th centuries.  Although they were volunteers for experimentation and exploration, they were not made fully aware of what they were going to be used for by their superiors.  Consequently, when their space ships cracks up on entry the survivors. some thinking they are living in the past, some more aware of the present are confronted with a puzzle.  They must figure out how to survive in an alien world where their neighbors are escapees from the Russian mind control project-- and the Russians want their people back.<br />Key Out of Time moves to the water world of Hawaikan.  Ross Murdock, a character from the earlier books, is thrown into the past of this world when a storm blows up while they are setting up a time gate.  The Russians are only mentioned in the beginning so the book feels less dated than Defiant Agents.  The action here involves a struggle among the ancient people of Hawaikan to escape the influance of the mysterious aliens whose wrecked ship provided the technology that let the people of Earth reach into space.<br />These books are well worth reading.  Individually I gave Defiant Agents a 4 and Key Out of Time a 5.  The first one was pulled down by the Russian/US conflict that probably doesn't resonate with current attitude toward the Russians.	2003-03-01

The world is so different from what they expected after viewing the information from the alien ship that brought them to the planet, that they have decided to do a risky experiment and travel into the past of the planet.  They are joined on this venture by two mutant dolphins and a female agent of Polynesian descent.<br />However, just as they set up the time gate, a storm blows up and disaster strikes.  Murdock is flung through the gate and into the planet's past.  The time gate is destroyed.  Murdock is left to try to cope with the different and aline world he finds himself in, where it seems there is currently a three way struggle going on even without the presence of the mysterious aliens who have dogged the Time Traders from the start.<br />Without many references to the Russian/US race to colonize space, this book is not much dated at all.  Murdock's resentment about the interjection of a woman into their crew is all too believable.  However, Norton rarely takes the expected route and the story remains thoroughly entertaining.	2003-03-01

I do not want to suggest though that she had a simplistic &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot; attitude.<br />In this near future book the US is in a race with the Russians to use alien technology scavenged from crashed spaceships to colonize planets outside our solar system.  Because they feel that they are in dange of losing this race, men working for the United States government have decided to use a group of volunteers from the Apache tribe as subjects in an experiment without their knowledge.  By use of the Redax, the volunteers will be made to think and act as Apaches of the 18th and 19th centuries would respond.  It is hoped this would help them better adapt to life on a primative planet.<br />However, the spaceship they are traveling in crashes on the planet of Topaz.  Travis Fox escapes with a group of the surviving volunteers.  In exploring the planet he learns that they are not the only group on the planet.  The Russians using their own version of the Redax have Mongol nomads as their subjects.<br />There is a definite feeling in this book that governments, each with their own goal would use whatever means are available to achieve that goal, no matter how it might affect the individual.  This is occasionally mistaken for a paranoia about technology, but in reality it is a distrust of human altruism.<br />This is a good adventure story-- and the crashed alien ships yielding technology is going to be even more familiar to the X-file generation than it was to the original reader in 1963.	2003-02-26

Eadulf, on the other hand, sort of follows along providing occasional backup.<br />While I'm not sure that I totally agree with Tremayne's view of 7th century Ireland, the books give a good view of a time and place not usually dealt with in light fiction.  The homicide body count in Araglin is quite high, not to mention other assorted lesser crimes from cattle stealing to allowing your animals to trespass on a neighbor's land and defecate there (very disapproved of).

But it's not that easy, as circumstances drag in Dane Blackmoor, her expatriated ex-lover.<br />The really developed relationships in this book though are between Quinn, her daughter, her housekeeper and her housekeeper's daughter.

J. Cherryh refers to Norton's Witch World novels as \\"the good stuff\\".  She is right.  I am so pleased to have this omnibus collection of the three seminal Witch World novels although it can never replace my tattered old Ace paperbacks with the Jack Gaughin covers.  It even felt a little odd to be reading clear text (minus some of the typos that Ace was notorious for) on a white page instead of the yellowing pages of the acidic paper of these old books.<br />However, I found myself just as caught up in the story of Simon Tregarth, the tarnished war hero who stepped through a gate ahead of an assassin into the world of Jaelithe, the Witch of Escarp, as I have ever been.  The story of these two who fight, along with Koris of Gorm and Loyse of Verlaine, to try to preserve the ancient world of Escarp from the advance of the Kolder, is played out against a vivid background of cultures such as the Falconers, who value their hawks far more than their women; the Sulcar, valient seagoers; and last but not least the matriachal Witches who rule the land of Escarp through the power of the jewels and their minds.<br />The third book is Year of the Unicorn.  It is set in High Hallack, a land of dales and small holdings.  High Hallack has been torn by war with Alizon from overseas.  This story is set after the war has been won when the Dalesmen are faced with meeting a bargain they made during their most desperate hours with a people they feared, the Were riders.<br />The premise is the barter of 13 brides for the services of the Were Riders against the hounds of Alizon.  The heoine is Gillian, who also came from overseas on an Alizon ship as a child, but not of Alizon.  The hero is Herrel who does not fit into the mould of his kinsmen and thus has suffered all his life as an outsider in a very close knit group.<br />Published in the 60's these books have not aged a bit and are as fresh as the first time I picked them up.ot aged a bit and are as fresh as the first time I picked them up.	2003-02-17

That, if nothing else, should tell you we are in Romanceland, Texas.  Lance, half Comanche, works for Summer's rich daddy.  In the prologue Summer gets Lance fired because she is caught kissing him.  The fact she instigated it doesn't help.<br />Does Summer then learn to consider the consequences of her actions to others before she acts?  No, not a bit.  Has Lance learned that he should avoid selfish rich girls?  Nope.<br />Five years later Summer sends him a letter and asks for his help.  I would have really enjoyed seeing Lance tell her to take a flying leap, but since this was in the beginning of chapter one it would have made for a very short novel.  Instead, Lance, the masochist, demands as his price for helping her, that she marry him.<br />Summer, who is still hot for Lance gets all excited at the idea of marrying someone she seriously wronged who is a social outcaste and says yes.  (OK, he says he's doing it to improve his social standing, she says she is doing it to save her sister but it's not her sister that gets her wound up on her wedding night and he's not counting how many head of cattle she has.)<br />The sex is repetitive and boring.  The writing is also pretty pedestrian.  There's an overuse of ellipses in the dialogue that makes Summer sound like she has a bad asthmatic wheeze.  \\"I...just can't believe...You're really serious\\" and \\"Yes, but... marriage.... It's...such a high price.\\"<br />Don't expect any surprises in this book.  And don't expect too much from Lance, he's more sad than savage.	2003-02-08

Oliphant is Sheri Tepper and a stunning writer whether she is dealing with the far future or the deepest rescesses of the heart.<br />Jason Lynx, the hero of this series, is a man who has been seriously wounded by life.  He was abandoned as an badly burned infant on the steps of a children't home.  He spent the next four years undergoing skin grafts.  At the age of 14 he was taken in by an antique's dealer who had helped him get his start in the interior design business.  Later he married but his wife disappeared and his son was found strapped in a car seat in a wrecked vehicle.<br />Now it is eight years later.  Jason has taken over his foster father's business and has established himself as a successful businessman.  Then one Sunday his neighbor George asks him to check on his dogs while he goes to pick up his wife who has had a minor accident.  What follows is murder, bombings, and the breaking open of scabs that have crusted over old wounds.<br />This is a very good novel and a very good mystery.  While it was first published in 1989 there is very little dated about the book.	2003-02-08

Her stories about outsiders who succeed by finding the right path for the right person, something that out of step adolescents need to hear. Ms. Norton graciously responded with a letter I cherish nearly a decade later-- actually it's professionally framed and hanging in my office.<br />This was one of the books I was thinking about when I wrote her. The hero has great physical strength, but feels as though he lacks the mental swiftness and physical grace to fit into the world of his father. He flees using a stolen travel tape and ends up on Mimir where he must find the courage and wits to survive and foil a villainous plot.<br />On one level a simple adventure story, on another a story that most adolescents, who can't seem to fit in their changing bodies, can identify with. This Norton's juvenile stories at their best.	2003-02-08

It breaks nearly every rule about genre romances.  It's a book I can't forget.<br />Ana was raised in abject poverty.  She has made her way in the world of mid 19th century New York by exploiting her intelligence and her body, but she still resides in a world of violence.  One night the violence touches her and she find herself needing to escape.<br />Cain Alessandro is an alcoholic doctor.  He ekes out a meager living between drinking bouts.  When he is given a chance to go to California where gold has been discovered he agrees even though he will be posing as Ana's husband.  Cain has no interest in the physical if it does not involve acohol.<br />The trip, part way by ship to Panama and then by land cross the isthmus, tests both of them physically and emotionally as they face their demons.

He has a powerful patron who has promoted him to the position of prominence he holds at the time the books opens.  He is also alienated from his family because he suffers from a condition that today would be termed bi-polar disorder or manic-depression.  In the 19th century it was simply madness.<br />Imogene Carter is the daughter of a wealthy dilatante artist who lives in Nashville (the Athens of the South).  Her sister had been a talented young artist, but her sister had died.  In an effort to please her father, Imogene has come to New York, where her godfather has secured for her a place among Jonas Whitaker's students.<br />The depiction of someone suffering a bi-polar disorder is very realistic.  Chance does an excellent job of portraying a three dimensional couple with real problems that must be overcome.  It's a particular pleasure to see Imogene realize and resolve her own issues with her family.<br />If you enjoy iconoclastic romances this is definitely a book to treasure.	2003-02-07

This is probably one of the reasons that this book has such a great period feel.  The details, from the ditch running down the center of the stables to the trouble getting a hauberk (essentially a metal pullover) off a wounded man, all contribute to the feeling of reality.<br />Joscelin was the ... son of a great warrior.  His mother died during his childhood and took his father's heart with her to the grave.  Because his father has legitimate heirs, Joscelin had few prospects.  He had run away from home to fight as a mercenary at the age of 15.  Seven years later he had returned as the captain of his own troupe. Since then he had taken service where it was available and when it wasn't available he had rode the tourney circuit.  Now he has returned home briefly before beginning employment with the Justiciar of England, who ruled while King Henry II was in France.<br />On his way home he encountered Linnet and her husband.  Married at 13 to a brutal Lord, Linnet had one son she cherished and tried to protect from her husband's brutality.  She suspects her husband is plotting treason.  She knows that her husband is destroying her son's inheritance in futherance of his plans.<br />While the political background is important, the real driving force in this case is the dynamics set in force by Joscelin's father decades before.<br />This book definitely goes on the short shelf of books that manages to successfully combine a romantic sensibility and some semblance of real history.	2003-02-06

Carys is a rope dancer who had once been part of a successful troupe of traveling players. While they were welcomed because of the entertainment they provided, they are also outcasts because they do not have a master.<br />When the story opens the troupe has been disbanded. Carys' latest protecter has just been killed. Carys herself is threatened with rape and murder by the men at arms of the lord in whose hall she was dancing and she is forced to use all of her wits to escape.<br />Alone and destitute, she is found by two men traveling together-- Telor, a minstrel, and Deri, a dwarf. As a minstrel who entertains in lordly halls, Tedor, the son of a respectable burgher, is of higher social status than Carys or Deri although Deri was once a respectable settled man himself before misfortune reft him of wife and home. Tedor is on his way to visit his old teacher, the Welsh bard Eunion.<br />But events of this turbulent time have overtaken the manor where Eunion was living under the protection of an amiable lord, and Telor, Carys and Deri become involved in a lively adventure where their lives are at stake.<br />Gellis does her usual excellent job of drawing the reader into her medieval world. The afterword is definitely worth reading because she lays out there some of her philosophy about writing historical novels. This book is one of her best. The unusual characters and lively action mean that there is nothing in the least dull about this book.	2003-02-03

The Duchess has given her the task of trying to reign in the Duchess' neice (and Sara's old friend) the widowed Lady Easterling.  Lady Easterling, the much petted younger wife of a sporting lord, is a hoyden with a vocabulary that is largely made up of Regency slang.  And that is a problems with this book.<br />Regency slang was used by the characters of Georgette Heyer's books appropriately and in moderation.  The author of this book seems to have absorbed all of the slang phases in Heyer's dozens of books and then spewed them all out at once.  Even characters who normally wouldn't use the phrases use them.  You could drown in Regency slang in this book.<br />While the book is not terrible, if you haven't read dozens of books by Georgette Heyer, I would suggest that it is a bit hard for a novice Regency reader to get through without recourse to a slang dictionary.<br />Besides being given to slang, Lady Easterling is also annoying as she rushes headlong from one solicism to the next.  The plot is nothing extraordinary.<br />As an experience I think this book is a few steps above running your knuckles over a cheese grater.	2003-02-01

Islaen Connor, who had been one of the most effective Commandos in leading the resistance against the invaders on the planet Thorne, finds herself at a crossroad.  She must either leave the service that she loves or accept a desk job that will remove her from the star roving that she enjoys.  Her current assignment is as leader of a small group that is investigating an illegal colony on a little known world.<br />When returning to her rooms she catches sight of a spacer who seems familiar. Closer examination reveals that her supposition is right.  A man, a gallant enemy she thought disgraced and dead for his failure to follow a genocidal order from his superiors, is also planeted at this spaceport.<br />This space opera would not have been out of place serialized in some of the pulp magazines of the forties and fifties.  The writing is clunky in places, the emotions bathetic, and there is nothing particularly new and exciting in this story.<br />But the action is nonstop and sometimes reading about Good and Noble characters defeating Bad and Evil villains can be comforting.  The reader needs to turn off lit-crit sensibilities and dive right in for an exciting ride.	2003-01-30

It's not that I dislike books with more sexual content, I'm not the least prudish, but sometimes a book like Victoire just hits the spot.<br />Victoire is daughter of an officer who was killed fighting Napoleon when she was about 13.  After her father's death her mother who was French remarried a Frenchmen who sent Victoire to live in Normandy with his mother.  However, following Napoleon's abdication, the old lady had become delusional and it was necessary to send Victoire to her father's cousin, an Irish scoundrel.<br />But the Irish scoundrel has plans for Victoire that involve trying to separate the family of the Marquis of Tarn from a substanial sum of money.  When Tarn unexpectedly returns to England and scotches this plan, the scoundrel hatches one that is even more dastardly and tries to draw Victoire into it.<br />A fast paced fun read with a hot tempered (uh, definitely not feisty) heroine and a young and engaging hero.	2003-01-28

The fact is that I cannot believe in the will set up.  From what the author tells us it is clearly contrary to the Rule Against Perpetuities (Duke of Norfolk's Case 1681.) One of the purposes of this Rule was to prevent exactly what happened in this book, an interest in property being tied up for generations.<br />Once I got over that, though, I settled back and enjoyed the story of duelling claimants for an 8 million pound fortune.  Rolande Henry is a stray sprig of the Henry family (quite mad, the whole bunch of them) who has landed in Calais as an actress in a third rate provincial troupe.  She happens to look a great deal like the mother of the missing heir.  Jasper Carrington decides to enlist her in an attempt to prove the current claimant espoused by his aunt and her sleazy solicitor, a fraud.<br />Rolande, who is neither stupid nor cowardly, finds herself tossed from role to role, intriguing with the best of them.  The book is fast, fun and well worth reading.  The Regency background is definitely more than wallpaper.<br />(Rule Against Perpetuities: an interest will vest, if it vests at all, within a life in being (at the time of the creation of the interest) plus 21 years.  If it fails to vest within that time period then it is void from creation.)	2003-01-27

He is the PI Knight Errant.<br />The story opens in 1985 when the number one teen idol is found with an underaged girl in a very compromising situation.  This is the last of a series of alcohol fueled missteps resulting in his incarceration in a mental hospital.  Eventually, he is released and five years later it seems that he is finally getting his life back on track when he becomes the suspect in a grisly murder investigation.<br />The murderer isn't hard to figure if you pay attention while reading.

The action never flags.	2003-01-27

Shirley McClintock had just flown back from a trip to Washington D.C. to deal with some property she owned there when she discovers that her Colorado world had changed while she was gone.  And the cause of it was El Azoli, an easterner who has no idea how to handle western ranch property.<br />But other things are changing around Shirley.  Old friends and neighbors are passing away.  Evils from the urban centers are reaching out toward her Colorado childhood home.  Azoli's death could be due to having offended either the old or the new interests though.  He was an equal opportunity jerk.  But fate it seems is ready to play Shirley a bad hand when she is accused of this particular murder.<br />Sheri Tepper (B. J. Oliphant and A. J. Orde), who also writes wonderful science fiction, does a great job here.  Unlike some mystery writers she never loses track of the fact that a murder is an intrusion into the lives of the characters, that there are still fences to mend and meals to cook.  Shirley, J.Q., and Alison do not fit in any particular mould that would be described as family on a tax form, but they clearly care deeply for one another and for the land they live on.	2003-01-26

(I'm excluding her franchise work here.)  This book is no exception.<br />The main characters in fantasy works are often very young.  The theme is often coming of age.  This is a fantasy for the sandwich generation, the one caught between the demands of children and aging parents.  The story opens with the heroine essentially an orphan.  Her father, who raised her after her mother's death, has died.  Romantic relationships have failed her and all she retains of her last marriage is an attachment to her step children.  However, she finds herself reluctantly playing maternal figure to some troubled college kids while her mother reappears.<br />It turns out her life is a great deal more complicated than she expected.  There are going to be great demands placed on her but she is going to have great personal resources to meet these demands.<br />Watching the heroine discovering who she is and essentially coming into her power is a positive experience.  I found myself cheering her on as she copes with the unexpected burdens she finds laid on her, both magical and mundane.  Of the three faces of the goddess-- virgin, matron, hag, this is the one that is shown the least and I'm very happy to have Ms. Abbey fill this lack.	2003-01-25

In Gellis' ancient world the Gods of Olympus are powerful mages.  There are also lesser magicians who have an innate psychic power.  They are referred to as Gifted.  These individuals are often either dedicated to the gods where they live protected in their temples, or they move freely among the populace often hiding their Gifts for fear of being accused of witchcraft and killed.  Greece is a particularly bad place for the Gifted.<br />Eurydice is a Thracian.  In her case she had early been identified and taught in the temple, but she left a certain degree of wanderlust and left the temple to travel.  When the story begins she had just escaped from servitude to a magician by draining his power from him.  She is hiding on a nearly uninhabited spit of land when the boat, the Argo, beaches there.<br />The Argo is manned by a group of heroes who have sworn to aid their captain, Jason, in reaching the land of Colchis and retreiving the fleece of a magical ram.  Among these heroes is Orpheus, a Gifted musician whose enchants those who hear it.  Orpheus sponsors Eurydice who convinces Jason to take her with them because she knows the location of someone who can tell Jason how to reach Colchis.<br />Orpheus is both drawn to Eurydice, and repulsed by the fact that she has been raised in a society where women are given more freedom than in his village in Greece.<br />While the adventures that they engage in are a lot of fun, especially for the reader who has some knowledge of the stories of Greek myths, there is a certain flatness to the story which is why it missed being 5 stars.  I think it has to do with the fact that one of Gellis' strengths in her Medieval stories is that she has a such a definite idea about what the period was physically like.  She knows about who would sit in a stool and who would sit in the probably one chair available and why. While she seems have done a lot of research about bronze age Greece, there is just less known about the social and domestic habits of the period so it feels less concrete.<br />All in all though, still a better than average story with a strong romantic subplot.le she seems have done a lot of research about bronze age Greece, there is just less known about the social and domestic habits of the period so it feels less concrete.<br />All in all though, still a better than average story with a strong romantic subplot.	2003-01-24

Normandy has been lost to France and now King Philip threatens Gascony.  Meanwhile in London, an elderly goldsmith's abused body has been found by his sons and young second wife.  The sons gather up all of their father's strong boxes of precious metals and jewels and most of their tools and flee leaving Madame Lissa to deal with the consequences of the goldsmith's death.<br />Sent for to investigate the murder is Sir Justin, captain of the London city guard, the force used to maintain order within the city walls.  This is not a simple death.  Peter de Flael was a wealthy merchant and one who had done work for King John himself.  Sir Justin, more used to being feared than welcomed, finds himself distrusting Lissa's open admiration based on his behavior during the great fire in London a year before.  Lissa herself had braved her miserly father's wrath to care for the stricken and observed Sir Justin's charitable behavior.<br />More a historical novel than a murder msytery, discovering the reason for Peter de Flael's death is only one of the narrative threads.  There is also the development of the relationship between Lissa and Sir Justin against a backdrop of political struggle and Lissa's father's own machinations as he attempts to match wits against a powerful and amoral lord.<br />The characters are well drawn.  Gellis does a very good job of portraying the contrast between the interests of the merchants of London and the great barons of England.  Sir Justin and Lissa live in that nebulous area where wealthy merchants and the lesser gentry merge socially.  While Sir Justin has his knighthood to offer Lissa, Lissa is also the heir to her father's substantial apothecary business.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a meaty historical novel with a strong romantic plot, engaging characters and a strong historical background.	2003-01-13

On one hand, the author has written some of the few Regency romances since Heyer's death that did not assume the reader was a higher brain function deficient as Fiona Hill. This book is well written-- Pall turns a very neat sentence-- and the world of professional ballet is entertaining.  (I admit to not being a balletomane. I like modern dance, but would probably gouge my eyes out if I had to sit though another classical ballet.)  On the other hand, the mystery lacks urgency and the conclusion is almost anticlimactic.<br />Some good things about the book:  Pall's portrayal of a regency romance writer at work (or tryng not to work as the case maybe.)  She breaks with the tradition of a lot of romance writers as portraying their profession as filled with sexually frustrated spinsters.  I also liked the relationship between Ms Bodine and her friend Ruth Renswick.  It's nice to see such an imperfect but clearly affectionate relationship between mature women.  As I said, Pall writes beautifully and sensually about the professional dancers.  They are not caricatures and there is almost a voyeuristic pleasure in watching them interact with one another.<br />On the downside, the romantic interest is not particularly interesting and, as I mentioned, the resolution lacks punch.	2003-01-12

In the prologue of that book the read is told that Revolution is fomenting among the humans.  The nonhuman Norda are also planning their own revolution.  In anticipation of this, Zar't'lac, the genetic messiah-- the ultimate warrior, flees to the human side to try to protect his people from human aggression during their time of political turbulence.<br />Now, it is four years later and nothing much has happened in the political arena.  In the prologue of this book the reader is told that an assassin is being sent from the Norda Homeworld to human space to dispose of Zar't'lac.  It doesn't improve the suspense that it is also stated in the prologue that the assassin sent against the ultimate warrior is a \\"Beta breeding cull\\" and not too bright.<br />Zar't'lac is second in command on a human starship captained by Eivaunee Dorlan, the Provincial Commissioner and the richest man in the galactic empire.  They are sent by the emperor to track down a serial killer on a pleasure and mining planet.  There's no suspense at all here, the reader is shown who the killer is.  Zar't'lac and Eivaunee go down to the planet and start picking up women in bars.  Eventually they stumble on the serial killer. The end.<br />Two things:<br /><br />  1. The Ancient Greeks and comic book authors both know that if you create a hero without any vulnerabilities it is boring. See Achilles heel and kyptonite.  Even a second string Norda can defeat a human so why should I feel any concern for Zar't'lac?<br /><br />  2. In fiction suspense is good.  Sometimes it's better to show the reader things as they happen rather than reveal everything in the beginning.<br />  Even if, like me, you really liked the first in this series, I would suggest giving this one a pass.	2003-01-08

Sometimes you get diamonds, sometimes you get mud.  I've very glad of two things, one is that I did not see a close up of the cover before I bought the book-- very amateurish with wrong proportions.  The second is that I didn't read the blurb on the back that suggest this was a cross between Star Wars and Star Trek. Someone has a tin ear for fiction because any similarities between these two works and this book are purely superficial. As long as you are not trying to find a cross between Star Wars and Star Trek this book is well worth buying.<br />This is a story of two empires on the verge of revolution.  One empire is human, descended from old Earth, destroyed in a bitter civil war.  The Emperor is mad, his Court depraved, his heir a daughter who is as mad and depraved as the Emperor and his Court could make her.  The other Empire is that of the Norda, a long lived humanoid appearing race who have been engaged in a centuries long breeding program to produce the perfect member of their warrior class, the genetic Messiah.  They have succeeded.<br />The Norda culture is quite well developed.  There is strict segregation of the sexes and the males of the warrior class tend to bond sexually with one another.  Blood and battle are considered foreplay.  However, there is enough variation to make this more than a caricature of a warrior culture.  The viewpoint character from this culture, Zar't'lac, the genetic messiah, is not at all what his breeders intended.  For one thing he is not under their control.  The Council who governs the Norda wants to invade the human empire and enslave it's members.  Zar't'lac refuses to lend his leadership to this proposal, but instead intends to travel to the human empire and attempt to influence events from within it.<br />On the human side is Eivaunee Dorlan, the object of the emperor's insane desire and hatred.  He has been emotionally and physically damaged by the emperor but he struggles to survive and keep the emperor from laying hands on his family's vast wealth.<br />For a first effort this is quite good, in places surpisingly good. I already have the sequel to hand and I hope that the author perservers.rvive and keep the emperor from laying hands on his family's vast wealth.<br />For a first effort this is quite good, in places surpisingly good.

However, Gellis also did some things that set her apart from many of the historical novelists writing then or since-- she tried to make the attitudes of the people she wrote about consistent with the period.  You won't find her characters spouting off about equality for serfs or other attitudes that won't appear in the aristocracy for centuries to come. She does not concentrate deliberately on the unpleasant, but she does not hesitate to be a little more graphic about bodily functions that the average book written in the time.<br />This then is the story of a man who did not quite fit his time--personal circumstances have rendered him both hardier and more sensitive than many of his peers--and a woman (a girl really, she is 15 at the time of their betrothal) who struggles to work out what her place is in society and her marriage.<br />One of the things I found fascinating about my rereading of this book was the reactions of the two main characters seem psychologically realistic.  Both of them were essentially abused children--although no one at the time would have considered their parents' actions to be &quot;abuse&quot;-- who developed various coping mechanisms for dealing with their situations.<br />A good early effort by an author who grew to be one of my favorite writers.	2002-12-28

In Lyda Morehouse's dark, dystopic future religion causes more harm than the devil and the only freedom is to be outside of the law one way or another.<br />Told from multiple view points, that of Morningstar (Satan); Emmaline, a papal Inquisitor; and Page, an artificial intelligence, the reader is swept into a complex world of hackers, mutant creatures, musicians and organized crime.  There are so called smart cookies that trigger personal hologramic advertisements, superstar fusion polka bands and the fabulous Dragon of the East.  Themes from pagan myths twine through Christian and Muslim theology.<br />The author, Lyda Morehouse has an interesting web site in which she says that her first book, Archangel Protocol was written and rewritten over a period of years, this book was written in a relatively short period of time, but I definitely felt that this book was the more demanding of the two, chock full of pleasurable moments and treasures for the reader to discover.<br />Oh, yeah, and it's real scary.  I'ver redicated myself to that Separation of Church and State thing.	2002-12-28

It is an intriguing mix of religion and technology.  In this post-apocalyptic world, the end of the old order came with the Medusa bomb.  The effects of this bomb were so horrific that the nations turned against secular humanism, preceived as the philosophy that allowed this science to flourish.  The new governments required that each person have a declared established religion in order to be a citizen and to be connected to the commerce and information web of the LINK.  One of the harshest punishments is to be deprived of this connection, which is implanted at birth (if the individual is born under comfortable circumstances).  The have-nots in this case are a combination of dissenters, criminals and the desperately poor.<br />Deirdre, the viewpoint character, was a police officer.  Now she is an excommunicate private detective eking out a bare existence doing work for barter.  The story is told in first person so the reader begins as cut off from information about the current state of the culture as Deirdre is.  As the story unfolds, Deirdre meets a cop named Michael who asks her to become involved in a risky investigation.<br />Deirdre already has her own risky connections though with the leader of a Jewish terrorist cell and Mouse, the owner of mouse.net, an illicit version of LINK that is available to the disenfrancised.  Mouse is also the programmer of Page, an Artificial Intelligence that is one of the two recognized as closest to humanity.  Page operates as Mouse's presense online hence the name-- as in Home Page.<br />Sly humor, fast paced action and the ability to convey suspence make this book one of the best reads I've had in Science Fiction this year.	2002-12-17

The other half you will probably wish you recognized.  Retired school teacher, Patricia Ann, and her sister, Sister plan a week at Sister's beachside condo in Destin Florida along with one of Patricia Ann's friends and her daughter.  There is also a writer's conference that Sister is attending.<br />The first surprise they encounter is that the manager of the condo has gone from a comfortable greying 160 pounds to a blonde streaked 110.  The next surprise is that they find her body washed up on the beach, obviously not a victim of drowning.<br />As the other women residents at the condo go into full southern comforting of the widower mode, Patricia Ann and Sister do a bit of sleuthing, including at look at the real estate development that the murdered woman was involved with.  Her death, it seemed, had left her husband a very wealthy man and the other investers much better off, while relieving them of her demands for environmental conservation.<br />There are some poignant moment in this book as well as some laugh out loud pages-- Sister's short story has to be read about to be believed.  While I can't say that I did not spot the villain right off I did enjoy the outing.<br />If you are a fan of this subgenre then this book it highly recommended.	2002-12-16

While it can stand alone and Cherryh gives a good review of the back story, it is impossible, I would think, to fully appreciate the nuances of the human/atevi interface without having read the previous volumes.<br />Cherryh's experience as a translater has clearly aided her in creating an interesting character in Bren Cameron and a fascinating society in the world of the Atevi/humans. Marooned by his dedication to the spirit of his job and his sense of justice in an alien culture, Bren manages to form attachments and create his own role in Atevi society.  That the relationships he develops with his alien hosts are easier for him to understand than his relationships with his family is a great piece of irony.<br />In this book the introduction of the second alien culture, the necessity of the association of Atevi and humans to withstand the stresses involved in contact with this new force, creates an engrossing storyline that expands on the previous themes introduced by Cherryh.<br />This is definitely the thinking being's science fiction.	2002-11-07

Hodgell has a small but dedicated group of fans and those of us who sweated the years after her previous publisher went belly up have been rewarded by Meisha Merlin (her new publisher) with handsome new editions of her three novels written about Jame and the world of the Kencyrath.  Now they have reprinted the four short stories previously published under this title and included four new stories.<br />Written by P. C. Hodgell over the course of a couple of decades, these short stories are of variable quality, however, they are a valuable tool to show the evolution of Jame and her world. (OK, there's also one Sherlock Holmes story which the publisher says they threw in just for fun.) The stories probably are of more interest to those who have read the novels and want to know more about the background, but if someone wants to know what Hodgell's writing is like without committing to a novel then these stories are a good place to start.<br />This is an extra nice tidbit to have on the bookshelf while waiting for her next Jame novel Meisha Merlin has promised us in the future.	2002-11-05

Unfortunately, after this chilling moment, the story goes back to business as usual-- body count.  Somehow I expected better from a Bram Stoker Award Winner.<br />An unexpected earthquake wakes up a monstrous creature who has been napping in a cave in the center of the country.  He starts looking for a late night snack.  20 cows, a bull, a deer, a dog, two rednecks, a farmer and a teenager later and I'm almost as comotose as the monster was for millenium. Very few of the characters are more than two dimensional targets set up for the monster to take down.<br />This book fails at sustained horror.  The best horror novels are first of all well written books with a tight plot, characterization, and good story telling.  The fear factor arises from a combination of many elements in the story, so there is not one path to scaring the reader, but the author cannot play one note over and over again and expect the reader to respond with the same amount of fear each time.	2002-11-03

The first one was My Lady's Tutor.  I thought it was rather stulifying with an over the top villain.  I had heard that this book, Schone's first, was liked by people who found her others tiresome.<br />Overall it was stulifying with an over the top villain.<br />Things I liked about the book:<br />1.  The heroine in the beginning.  Middle-aged, dumpy Elaine in a dull marriage gets a second chance in the body of Morrigan, a thin twenty-one year old upper class lady.  Yay, good for Elaine.<br />2.  The initial confusion that Elaine had after she was propelled into the past and a less than happy situation.  Elaine's attempt to edge into the role of Morrigan.  I can even accept Hattie the Harridan, which at first was a rather fun twist on the motherly old family retainer who protects the heroine.  Hattie is a beldame with a taste for the more punitive aspects of the Christian religion and clearly has dominated Morrigan.<br />Things I didn't like:<br />1.  Whether you are right or left handed has everything to do with the body and has nothing to do with who is living in your head.  This could have been an interesting situation, but instead it is just an annoying distraction.<br />2.  I do not believe that a 39 year old modern woman who has been married for 17 years has NEVER been french kissed.  I just do not believe it.<br />3.  Why does the hero put up with his wife's obnoxious relatives who clearly she does not even like?<br />4.  Oh, no, another over the top villain.  This one is really over the top.  Sorry, I don't buy the villain at all.  Schone's villians strongly suggest that she has some gender issues.<br />Why are all of the females in this book (aside from the heroine and her maid) two dimensional monsters?  Why does the author equate being overweight with either being sexually unfulfilled and/or ill mannered and evil?  Did it ever occur to Elaine while she was staring at her hairy legs that attacking those hairs with a straight razor might make everyone think she was, well, unhinged?<br />By the time it got to the climax, I just didn't care.  The author had made too many blunders, the plot was weak and the only character who appeared to be more than two dimensional was Elaine.ng those hairs with a straight razor might make everyone think she was, well, unhinged?  <br />By the time it got to the climax, I just didn't care.

By the time I had finished the top of the book was a forest of little white scraps.<br />If you are a reader who likes books that are strong on the history or the mystery this book is not for you. It actually begins with an entertaining and nonserious look at Richard the Lionhearted, who has a bit of a publicity problem in England. His mother, in an effort to improve his image, had ordered the release of certain prisoners. Now a young nun was found slain in dramatic circumstances that suggest one of the freed prisoner's performed the heinous act and Richard needed someone to take a look at the situation at Hawkenlye Abbey. The someone he chose was Sir Josse, a knight he had known briefly as a young page, who just happened to be in the right place at the right time. Sir Josse, on the other hand, is not too pleased to be sent to England. Nevertheless, he goes.<br />Hawkenlye Abbey is a very unusual medieval institution. It is a double institution, with both monks and nuns under the control of the Abbess. But that's not what is so unusual about it. The surprising part is that 1) Sir Josse appears to walk as freely in and out of the nunnery as he would a manor house, 2) nuns appear to be creeping in and out at all hours of the night, without being noticed, and 3)the Abbess appears to have no problem having unchaperoned meetings with Sir Josse. Also they run a retirement home for old monks and nuns--one home for both it seems. (I have this irrisistable image of aged monks and nuns playing shuffleboard) They also run a reformatory for repentent prostitutes, who are reclaimed from their sinful life by becoming mothers. (Don't ask.) And my favorite was the hospital where a nun was helping a man learn to walk on a crutch. A poacher, explains the Abbess serenely, who lost his foot in a mantrap. I think we are in Disney World.<br />As for the mystery, Sir Josse appears to think that the state of the sole of a leather shoe worn by a body that has been prepared for burial, encoffined and left in a subterranean crypt for a couple of weeks in the heat of the summer would help his solve a mystery. He also takes a cast of a footprint using melted wax from candle ends. I suppose it is possible but I would wonder why since he knew who the footprint belonged to and rules of evidence were somewhat sketchy at the time. No chain of custody or best evidence rule then. Finally, my favorite, when Sir Josse (who is staying at the guesthouse) stumbles on a body, takes off his tunic to covers its face then rushes bare chested into the Abbess' presence.<br />The resolution of the mystery in certain ways is telegraphed rather broadly, in other ways definitely violates some of the rules of fair play. But that is for the reader to discover.n Disney World.<br />As for the mystery, Sir Josse appears to think that the state of the sole of a leather shoe worn by a body that has been prepared for burial, encoffined and left in a subterranean crypt for a couple of weeks in the heat of the summer would help his solve a mystery.

There is a lot of backstory and while the authors do a good job with weaving explanations in the text, there were times when I found myself asea about certain points dealt with in the earlier books.  However, I read the two previous novels and I was delighted to find this one.<br />Moving in time between American Pre-history and the present, the authors touch on nearly every major controversy about the Anasazi, past and present.  Vicious scholarly infighting is contrasted against the swing of war clubs.  As the suspense builds, the authors do a good job at showing how the investigative skills of archaeologists are not that different from that of law enforcement (whether in the past or present)-- both are attempting to reconstruct past actions and draw conclusions about the actors.<br />Definitely recommended for a reading on a chilly evening with a pot of hot coffee and a few biscotti on a tray.	2002-10-11

Set in Florida this book is different from her two previous novels.  The suspense is still set high, but it shares center stage with the skullduggery involved when millions of dollars worth of horse flesh meets limitless greed.<br />Former cop Elena Estes is asked by a young girl to find her missing older sister who was working as a groom for a trainer with a bad reputation.  Elena is trying to physically and emotionally recover from the loss of her career.  During the course of the investigation Elena rediscovers qualities she thought she had lost.<br />While not as intense as some of her other books this is a good solid read for a lazy afternoon.	2002-09-28

Oliphant is the basic decency of her series characters.  Shirley McClintock, the protagonist in this series, her friends A.J. and Xianthippe and her foster daughter Alison, form a warm and loving extended family.  Their strong moral values at time contrast sharply with the selfish and willful people they encounter.  But don't take this to mean that their values are conservative.  They are more based on commen sense and kindness than any particular religious or political stance.<br />At the time of this story the guest ranch has a pair of selfish and annoying young newly weds as guests.  There is another wedding in the offing because Shirley has broken one of her rules and agreed to rent the ranch as the background for a society wedding.  The bride and the bride's obnoxious mother are adding to the disturbed atmosphere-- later to be joined by a couple hundred guests, a mariachi band, a dance band, a photographer, caterer and wedding coordinator.<br />Before this happens though, the first young couple decided to plant a tree to symbolize their relationship. They ask to borrow a spade and Shirley tells them they can have an old trenching tool to use. Instead they take her new shovel, a gift from A.J.  That, as much as anything, sends Shirley on their trail when they don't return to the guest house.<br />Oliphant starts out with what seems a simple crime, but investigation results in greater and greater complexity as characters and background are added.  Each addition helps to fill the puzzle out until at last a satisfactory conclusion is acheived.	2002-09-17

Not gritty as is determined but gritty as in sand in your shoes.  Glasgow as portrayed in this book is abysmally depressing and filled with predators and prey.  I couldn't put it down.<br />The theme the author builds the mystery around is abuse in its myriad forms.  The main character is Maureen, a survivor.  Her family definitely did not put the FUN in dysfunctional.  She has just found out that her lover is married.  She has a dead end job.  There doesn't seem to be much left to do but go out on a whizzer.  Then, she wakes up with a hang over and her troubles really start.<br />The language is probably a little rough for the more delicate mystery lover--it's definitely not a cozy. It does have an authentic edginess to it.  I can honestly say that the raw edges of Glasgow are similar to those in any urban area I've known.  Her description of Glasgow's mean streets, and even meaner inhabitants, is gripping and engaging.<br />It should probably be noted that this is the first of a series. The plot in the first one has a satisfactory resolution, but it's only a waystop, not a conclusion. The second, Exile, and the third, Resolution, are already available in the US.  So be prepared to enjoy this triptych of terror.	2002-09-11

One of the most important relationships she feels she losing is with her friend Lesley.  So when Lesley asks her help in finding out what happened to a client of the shelter for abused women she agrees for the sake of Lesley and the client's husband, who appears to be a most unlikely batterer.<br />Many of the characters from Garnethill reappear including the sympathetic and unsympathetic officers of the law, Maureen's protective brother Liam, and Lynn his first girlfriend.  New characters are introduced, notably Kilty Goldfarb, a disenchanted social worker and Vik, Maureen's new love interest.<br />The plot twists and turns between London and Glasgow, as Maureen tries to puzzle out exactly what happened to Ann Harris and why.

The current favorite is Waleran of Meulan who is in contest with William of Ypres, the protector of Magdalene la Batarde, for the king's ear.<br />William summons Magdalene, the mistress of the Old Priory Guesthouse, an upscale medieval brothal, to Oxford to help him with information gathering. Men may meet at a prostitute's lodgings without suspicion.  Magdalene travels to Oxford in the Company of Sir Bellamy, the Bishop of Winchester's knight and her particular friend.  In Oxford she seeks lodgings with an old friend who runs a brothel called the Soft Nest.<br />Then events start to escalate as a man is murdered and one of William's captains is implicated-- or is it all a plot to destroy William?  Magdalene meets old friends and new as she tries to unravel the mystery of who killed a drunken man at arms and why (and who was the highborn patron who had tried to help the dead man secure a marriage with a wealthy orphan in the King's wardship.)<br />Like the two previous books in this series, this is a great read with a good feel for the period and a good mystery.  And as an added inside joke for those of us who are Gellis fans there is even a reference to the hero of one of her previous historical novels (not a mystery).	2002-08-28

It reminded me a bit of the hit British television series Red Dwarf.  Drewcilia Qwah, a hard as nails Salvager who runs her ship (the Garbage Scow) with the aid of a tall, hairy alien named Van Gar, is asked to transport an important mission to return a captured Queen to her King.  Drewcilia, who is somewhat suspicious of the setup, lets her love of money overcome her good sense and agrees.  Thus begins a rather rollicking space opera.<br />Drewcilia has fun.  She thinks that every ship should have an ice chest full of beer on the bridge.  When not downing cold beer she likes mixed drinks with suggestive names that pack a hell of a hangover.  When it comes to trading her morals are somewhat lacking but she does not double cross her friends.  Her plans also tend to succeed, if everyone else would just keep out of the way and let her work.<br />For those of delicate sensibilities, yes the language is rough, but it's real language as used by real rednecks not toned down for a &quot;pg13&quot; rating. Lynn Abbey in her introduction talks about how well Rosen's writing lends itself to being read.  I agree.  It's not that Drew doesn't have some delicacy of feeling, it's just that she expresses it in actions and not words.	2002-08-28

However, Tessa brazens it out.<br />The character of Tessa Vance was created for an Australian TV series, but the book is more than an adaptation of a TV script into a novel. Jennifer Rowe created the story line herself so she can tell the story in more depth here. The book is not as strong as the Verity Birdsong series, but it is quite entertaining.<br />Recommended for those who enjoy police procedurals and a good puzzle plot.	2002-08-26

The interesting thing about the ring is a secret compartment containing a portrait of Anne Boleyn.  This lent my reading of this book about the relationship between the memory of Anne Boleyn and the life of Elizabeth I a certain poignancy it might not have otherwise had. What this ring suggests is that Elizabeth treasured the memory of her mother but knew that it could not be given public expression due to the circumstances surround Anne Boleyn's death.  This is pure speculation, the real reason that Elizabeth had the ring cannot be known. But this author does try to recreate the story as it might have been.<br />I found myself reading this book not as a fictional recitation of historical events, but as the story of a dysfunctional family and how the actions of one generation affect the next.  The author uses the relationship between Anne and Henry VIII to explain why Elizabeth made some of her early choices with regard to matrimony. I've seen this same theory expounded by other writers but Maxwell does a very good job by interpolating Anne Boleyn's diary entries with events in Elizabeth's life.<br />Even if you do know the story of Elizabeth's life, this version is worth reading.	2002-08-24

Helen Emerson is an entirely too mundane prosecutor who finds herself opening her door to Rafferty at 7 am one morning.  He's there to try to talk her into giving Billy Moretti one more chance on probation.<br />It's not just Rafferty who came back.  All of the men who were killed in the massacre found themselves back in the city on February 13, 1938 and once a year since.

Now it's down to Rafferty, although there's a couple more like Billy Moretti who he was trying to spring that morning of Friday, February the 13th, still alive and kicking. And some of the men who died in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre deserved killing more than others.<br />Rafferty realizes in those 48 hours that someone is trying to kill Helen Emerson and, more importantly, that maybe she is his ticket back to reality if they can both stay alive.<br />Fast, fun and breezy, Anne Stuart has cooked up a great little Valentine Day's gift here to please the most demanding taste.	2002-08-21

She is probably best known for her books published as Tepper, but her Shirley McClintock Mysteries should not be ignored.<br />Shirley McClintock is a retired high level government employee, who has retreated to Taos to own and operate a guest ranch.  The story opens with one of her guests having a medical emergency.  Shirley and her good friend J.Q. rush her to the hospital where they discover that they know almost nothing about Alicia Tremble.<br />Meanwhile, her peace is further threatened by the sudden reappearance of her foster daughter's aunt and uncle, who had heretofore been content to have Shirley take on the responsibility of raising their niece.<br />When Alicia Tremble dies, however, it suddenly becomes necessary that Shirley, J.Q., and their friend Xianthippe Minging discover who Alicia Tremble was and who might have wanted her dead.  Shirley discovers that her comfortable life on the Rancho del Valle is more vulnerable than she would have ever guessed.<br />Oliphant writes in an oblique style that gives the reader all of the information but demands some work on the reader's part. Everything is explained in the end, but what dedicated mystery reader wants to be spoonfed the answer?  It is a pleasure to watch the author draw together a handful of separate strands and twist a thick rope of a plot out of them.	2002-08-20

The winter is cold and wolves lurk in the forest, some on four legs, some on two.  Edward, King of England is dying  and the vultures gather around his bed waiting to see who will claim the crown.  Will it be William, Duke of Normandy, or Harold Godwineson-- in defiance of his oath to help William to the crown?  What about the claim of Norway?  Meanwhile in Wessex, Godfrey Hafwynder, shire reeve, strives to preserve his household against an uncertain future.<br />Stephen, a young Norman, on an errand to deliver a message from his uncle to Duke William's man at Pevensey is harried by outlaws and wolves.  Wounded, he seeks shelter at Godfrey's hall and is cared for by Godfrey's daughter, Alison, her foster sister Wildecent and their aunt, Ygurna.  Ygurna is one of the last of the priestesses of the ancient Celtic religion, Alison has been trained to be her sucessor.  Alison has the wild magic, Wildecent does not.<br />However, Stephen was accompanied into England by his former tutor, Ambrose, an unordained deacon of the Roman Church and an adept of sorcery, trained in its mysterious arts by the Magi of the east.  Ambrose using his talents to locate Stephen incidentally finds Ygurna and her apprentice.  However, it is Wildecent, the headblind, that he tempts with his offer of a power that does not require the wild magic she cannot control.<br />This story of the Christmas before the Conquest is a fine blending of fantasy and history.  Abbey does an excellent job of portraying the basic conflict faced by men like Godfrey, whose King abandoned his earthly responsibilities to seek religious solace.  This is also echoed in the conflict between the wild magic of the old gods and the disciplined sorcerous power of Ambrose.  Abbey skillfully weaves a tale of beginnings and endings, of the death of the old and the birth of the new.	2002-08-20

There are some good, suspenseful books out there about mishaps in space.  Unfortunately this is not one of them.<br />I would believe that the author knows a lot about NASA.  The editorializing about the mishaps of the space program was quite believable and interesting. However, once the story kicks in things go rapidly downhill. The characters are 2D, the author kept telling me things rather than showing me and somewhere bits of the explanation went missing.<br />The story opens with earth losing contact with the crew on the moonbase.  It didn't happen all at once though.  There was some broken communications suggestive of something going terribly wrong.  There was also some video footage taken earlier that suggested there was problems among the moonbase crew.  For instance one of the crewmembers was wearing a kimono on camera (who checked his luggage?), another, in the same scene was wearing a parka, while others were described as just wearing skimpy outfits.  All is not well, right?<br />The next mission crew, waiting to take off, is hurriedly reorganized as a rescue mission and the plot thickens.  In fact, the plot gets so thick at one point that it can't be stirred with a spoon.  Unfortunately, it is also uninteresting. The characters lack focus and motive and the interesting bits are not enough to carry a novel of this size.<br />Forget this disaster of a novel.  If you want a suspenseful, exciting, well told story set in a believeable space environment check out Tess Garritson's Gravity instead.  It's even got a believable romantic element.	2002-08-18

It's nicely illustrated with photographs of extant castles and period illustrations.  I would definitely recommend this as either a book for the casual reader who might have an interest in medieval social life or a beginning for a more serious study.<br />The authors try to do a fair assesment of such issues as medieval hygeine (where it is all too easy to overwhelm the readers with descriptions of how dirty and disgusting the medieval life would be to modern sensibilities, thus overlooking that there was concern about unpleasant smells from the privy chamber, and how to fix it). The discussion on the duties associated with the feudal relationship is also very clear and readable.  I particularly was interested in the mention at several points that physical blows were used as mnemonic aids.  The buffet given a squire upon being knight was no mere tap, but many times a hearty blow meant to make him remember his oath of knightood.  Also, beating the bounds was used to teach youngsters where the important landmarks were often by giving them a blow at the site of the landmark, or even bumping them against it.  Fascinating look at the medieval ideas about learning-- which does have some effectiveness, epecially in a largely illiterate society, although it would probably be cause for arrest in any state in the US if it was used today.<br />Libraries have been written on any one of the sujects that was mentioned in this book so don't expect it to hold the one answer to any question about medieval life in a castle, but it can't be beat for a clearly written overview.	2002-08-16

However the book also has some moments that pull me irresistably back into my own childhood-- making ice cream in the heat of the summer evening with a hand cranked ice cream churn packed in ice, getting caught at the top of an old wooden farris wheel, gigging for frogs on a moonlit night.  Just when I decide I'm going to put the book back on the shelf and pick up something else, the author throws in one of these moments and I find myself reading on into the next chapter and beyond.<br />The author does a good job of capturing details.  The plot could have used a stronger editorial hand.  However, the book is still worth reading.<br />I like New Orlean.  In fact I always thought of it as the anti-Disney World, a town with a surface gloss of tourism, but where they wash the streets of the French Quarter down early every morning to remove the puddles resulting from the previous night's excesses.<br />Step back now to 1927 when booze was illegal but available nearly for the asking, Freudian psychology was still a new topic of conversation, and racism was an accepted way of life.  A lawyer-- with a debauched way of life that raised no eyebrows and a practice of defending Blacks who had fallen afoul of the New Orleans legal system that caused some consternation among his peers-- is hacked to death in an old slave shack behind his home of Sans Souci.<br />Damon Roarke, a detective on the New Orleans Police force, is called to the scene.  Roarke was reared by his drunken abusive Irish father, who had died a hero's death while performing his job as a policeman.  Roarke's mother had deserted them when Roarke was 7 to live with her upper class Creole lover. Damon had grown up in poverty with three good friends.  At the time the story opens one friend had disappeared and was presumed dead, the second was his widow-- Roarke's sometime lover, and the third was a powerful bootlegger.

The second highest religious figure in the Celestrial Empire, she had fled Duvalpore years before after a failed coup against the throne inspired by a false vision.  Now,at the request of her superior and friend she is returning at a time of great signficance.  It is the time of the year rite and also a hundred year rite.  On this occasion the world is literally remade from a map of sand laid down on a circular wheel by the priests.  Since her false vision Maskelle has been cut off from the Ancestors, and specifically from the Adversary, the power she represented.<br />Now unchancy things are happening, not just in Duvalpore.  Her journey home has been dogged with misfortune.  When she uses her power it is like lighting a beacon to attract the darker elements of magic.  As she comes closer to the city she encounters unnatural creatures.  In Duvalpore itself there is more than one mystery waiting for a solution.<br />Maskalle is an interesting protagonist.  Quick tempered, generous, honorable.  I also liked the fact that she was in her mid 40's and learning to live with her past mistakes.<br />Rian is not your average barbarian sword swinger.  Betrayed by his first overlady, nearly killed by his second lord, he is attracted to both the power Maskalle wields as well as her sense of honor.  There's also an endearing moment of lack of confidence when he wonders how his appearance stacks up agains Maskalle's previous lovers.<br />Wells has a talent for combining action adventure with political intrigue.  The back story is slowly revealed piece by piece as Maskelle moves closer to a confrontation with an unknown enemy whose goal is far more than the destruction of Duvalpore.

He is accompanied by his wife, a wealthy heiress from the West Indies and her companion, an impoverished gentlewoman, Pamela Hervey, who has been hired to teach Lady St Just how to get along in society.<br />Hetty, Lady St. Just is a bad traveler and the trip had been punctuated by her hysterics, as she resisted being removed from the anticipated pleasures of London.  Dainty and delicate, she was the spoiled daughter of a wealthy planter, married to St. Just for his title and background.  This had not been a happy marriage of convenience though, and when his father and two older brothers died in a sailing accident he had inherited the title and returned to claim the estate.<br />Pamela Hervey is Lady St. Just's opposite.  She has a generous, passionate nature and a clear sense of wrong and right.<br />Waiting at Tremaire is St. Just's cousin and heir, George, an impecunious London dandy; Sarah, more than a servent but devoted to St. Just; and a coven or two of witches, who are looked to by the country people to aid in a good harvest and safety for their men at sea.<br />The party from London arrives at a time when there is a power struggle going on in the local coven.  There are mysterious accidents, evil potents and strange rituals.<br />Those who like a good gothic novel should really latch on to this one.  It also should not disappoint Regency fans.  And those who simply enjoy Roberta Gellis' books are in for a real treat.	2002-06-14

However, when a book very clearly connects with this world's history and plain old gets it wrong, it annoys me no end.<br />The front flap of the dust jacket said the book was set in 1909.  Then one of the characters quote Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry.  Saint-Exup&eacute;ry was born in 1900.  I don't think he was publishing at the age of 9. The Lord Peter character, as distinguished from the male romantic interest, is clearly Lord Peter Wimsey (Dorothy Sayers creation) and he (per his creator)was born in 1890, so he would have been 19 years old at the time of this story.  Not nearly old enough to be a trusted agent of the Foreign Office.<br />The hunger strike by Suffragettes only began in July 1909 and the first hunger striker was in fact released, not force fed.  The force feedings came later and no one actually died from one-- only one Suffragette (Emily Davison) died as a result of protest activities and she was savaged by a horse when she ran onto the track and grabbed it's bridle.<br />There was also a reference to King Tut and his Great Wife.  Tutankhamun's tomb was not discovered until 1922 and the archeaologist was Howard Carter not Harold Carter.  However, the author was right about Egyptomania being an influence on home decorations even before that event.  She was wrong in thinking that common household articles were not yet given Egyptian style.  Long before Tutmanis struck, it was possible to find home funishings and decorations inspired by Ancient Egypt.<br />While retelling fairy tales can result in interesting books, trying to force a book into the fairy tale mold is not necessarily a good idea.  I didn't even think of the fairy tale theme until the villain shows up dressed up as an old woman and by that time it seemed more of a casual add-on than an intregal part of the plot.  I also resented the fact that the heroine, until that point a competent person, suddenly has to be rescued by the hero.<br />A little more attention to detail would have made this a much pleasanter read.ttention to detail would have made this a much pleasanter read.	2002-06-03

She grabbed my interest right off.  I've read all three books in this series and thought this was miles away the best, probably because of the heroine's strength of character.<br />However, in every one of these books she has introduced some lapse of logic that I found irritating.  In this case it was right at the beginning.  An (admittedly inexperience) forensic team is examining and clearing a body dump site.  The body has been tentatively identified as a local teenager by a class ring and a gold tooth (teenager with a gold tooth?) There's a statement about how the remains wouldn't fill a shoe box.  But somehow it is determined that the body was the estimated height and weight! of the missing teen?  How did they estimate weight from a skeletized body in fragments?  That is never explained.<br />Shame-- carelessness like that detracted from a rather good book.	2002-05-19

The author quickly introduces an interesting cast of characters, many of them connected with either the art world or the wealthy who patronise the arts. An intriguing murder occurs at a party following the shoot, the situation is set up to bring in Davenport, an intricate set of relationships is revealed, then-- nothing.<br />Davenport meets old flames, lusts, wonders about what might have been, meets another old flame, lusts some more, etc.  It's like the back of a shampoo bottle.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Meeting are held, proactive strategies decided on, press conferences held.  Lather, rinse, repeat.<br />Meanwhile the bodies are stacking up as death after death occurs.  I found myself skimming Davenport's rather boring personal angst-- poor fellow too many women lusting after him while he lusts after them-- while I followed the twists and turns of the plot.<br />Finally I closed the book thoroughly mad.  How dare Sandford do something so cheap?  No sense of closure.  No feeling of having been outwitted by the author or satisfaction of having outwitted the author.  This was a total waste of paper and ink. It may be time for Lucas Davenport to retire and write computer games full time if Sandford is going to let the series peter out this way.  It would be kinder to the character and his fans to do so.	2002-05-11

I thought from the titles that they might be series characters. They are, of course, but in this book their characters are not as clearly defined as in the later book. The action in this book focuses on Kate, a former FBI agent, now a victim advocate, and John Quinn, a special agent from the FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit.<br />Kate and John have history, but that was five years ago, five years during which Kate has tried to rebuild her life and John has concentrated on his career. Now, due to the activities of a serial killer called the Creamator (or Smokey Joe to the cops) they are brought together again in the course of the investigation.<br />I could have gone another 150 to 200 pages. After the build up the ending seemed rushed. The initial suspense is good, the characters are riveting. Nothing is terribly orginal but Hoag uses her palet with a sure hand and I had a hard time putting the book down until the very last page was turned but still I just the least bit dissatisfied with the conclusion.  Authors and publishers should realize that a book on adrenalin like this one needs a big pay off and that was what was missing in this case.	2002-04-16

Martha is a fiftyish musician, Mayland is-- well, Mayland is unusual, as people who have read the first book in this set, Tea With the Black Dragon, know.  When the book opens Mayland, Martha, Martha's young granddaughter Marty, and an ill assorted group of egotistical musicians have been on tour for eight weeks, playing traditional (and not so traditional) Irish folk songs.  At this point tempers are frayed while insults (and the occasional fist) are flying.<br />Then Marty disappears, a member of the band is found hanged by a twisted grass rope off a Pacific pier, and it up to Martha and Mayland to solve the mystery of where Marty is and who the murderer is.<br />Written in the mid 80's this book is a great favorite of mine, an urban fantasy mystery that mixes Celtic and Eastern lore with some solid detection.  The scenes with the band seem very true to life and the fantasy elements are delightfully underplayed. The chapter titles, by the way, as well as the title Twisting the Rope are all titles of trad. Irish tunes.	2002-04-11

So I was inclined to be pleased with this book when I finally got around to ordering it. And it provides a satifying amount of what I really like in escapist fiction.<br />Roxanne is content enough in her marriage to a ship's captain. The war with the Trin has ended in an uneasy peace and things ought to be a bit easier on an empath with psychic healing skills working on a battle cruiser. Anyone else looking on can see that her husband is a manipulative jerk and she is clearly destined for bigger and better things. In fact, she's due to be pulled out of her comfortable berth and tossed into the middle of trying to halt a plague with political implications.<br />Pyr is the captain of a ship heavily indebted to the Pirate League. His crew is mutinous. They are all infected with Sag, a plague that is wreaking havoc on many inhabited worlds and, in an effort to control the plague, addicted to the drug Rust. Plague suffers who don't take Rust die. Rust is controlled by the drug lords. On top of that, Pyr has also been given a slow acting poison for which there is no cure. Is there anyone else in the universe who needs a healer more?<br />The pirates are ruthless. The United Systems Military are ruthless. The space drug dealers are ruthless. There's a lot of violence in this book--be warned. Also it probably could have used a stronger editorial hand when dealing with the psychic cavorting, but there's some real moments of mischievous humor in this book. I also have to admit, my favorite character was Martin Braithwaite, who got more than he bargained for out of his healing.<br />If you are looking for something to read until the next Liaden Universe novel comes out you might give this one a shot.for something to read until the next Liaden Universe novel comes out you might give this one a shot.	2002-04-07

Together they must face the forces of the Wild Magic, of Sorceries sent against them by enemies outside Britain, and the convolutions of their own too human hearts.  <br />If you liked Ms Tarr's earlier fantasies, if you have a fondness for Kipling's Puck of Pook's Hill and Reward and Fairies, if you just enjoy a good historical fantasy then grab a copy, curl up on the couch with a small dog or two (I recommend a Jack Russell terrier) and settle down to enjoy a rousing-- and touching-- fantasy.<br />(By the way, the title is a pun.  It refers to both the feeling of pride, and a collective noun for all the young lions who make up the actors in this book. Try to pick them all out.)	2002-03-22

She is also burdened with a group of civilian scientists, the civilian salvage hunter who discovered the ship adrift in space and a news team.  Staff Sergeant Kerr is not happy.<br />Never fear though, Torin Kerr is her usual cool, collected and competent self, as she copes with surprise inspections, interspecies politics and the unexpected interest of a member of the opposite sex.<br />Craig Ryder had been looking for space salvage when he discovered a huge yellow artifact that appears to be an alien spacecraft.  He takes his information to the authorities and bargains his knowledge for an opportunity to return with the authorities to the derelict.  A party made up of a group of scientists containing most of the species of the Confederation and a dozen top-notch marines is assembled.  The Scientists are there to figure out what the derelict is, the Marines are there to make sure the scientists survive, Torin is there to make sure the Marines survive.  Craig Ryder is there to protect his interest in the salvage.  Captain Travik, the glory hound commanding officer is there to appear heroic and a credit to his species.<br />Not surprisingly things blow up in everyone's face and it's up to the Staff Sergeant to put everything back together.<br />My only flicker of discontent with this book is the fact that Torin is too competent, too much in control.  Otherwise, it is a fun book with lots of twists and turns.  The ensemble cast of characters is familiar without being too cliched.  Just when you think you know what is going to happen Huff throws another grenade and the whole picture changes, which makes for some exciting reading.	2002-03-16

Runa spent the next eleven years on the run from those who would do the same to her because of her ability to wield magic.  Finally she is caught, imprisoned for five years and then exiled.  After two years wandering in the wilderness she enters a green and pleasant land.  At this time she is 32, she has never established a home or a lasting relationship of any depth because of the misfortunes in her life.<br />The story opens with Runa being stalked by a large, invisible beast.  When it appears it is a silver striped, sabetooth tiger, longer than Runa's horse.  This Silver cat announces that Runa is its \\"meat\\" but does not attack her.<br />Exploring further, Runa discovers a land where the skeletons of the plague dead remain unburied.  It is also infested with outlaws.  She rescues a young boy whose father has been killed and learns that the land was once under the care of \\"the Burdened Ones\\", the Silver Cat Mantic and Margrave.  The Margrave was the war leader and hunter, the Mantic a magic wielder.  Together they provided protection, sustenance and healing for the \\"Tiller Folk.\\"  But about 150 years earlier the Margrave and Mantic had been deposed and killed in an uprising.  Since that time the land had suffered.  Anyone who had attempted since then to take over the Castellum where the Burdened ones had ruled has been destroyed by the magical guardians.<br />Her interest piqued, Runa manages to establish herself in the Castellum and begins to surround herself with the Tiller folk, but she finds herself unable to perform the roles of both the Margrave and the Mantic.  The Silver Tiger is the guardian spirit of the land who chooses the Mantic and mMrgrave.<br />Then, one day, a bearded and braided barbarian, accompanied by a dozen followers pounds at the gate of the Silver cat castellum with the warning that there savage cannibals are coming their way.  The savages are being herded their way by the other local leaders because they do not recognize Runa as a proper Mantic despite her possession of two horses and her undoubted skill at sorcery.<br />This is the story of how Runa and her barbarian come to terms with one another and with the requirments of being burdened by responsibility for other people.  From two separate cultures, neither completely understands the other, but they are forced to learn to cooperate and respect one another abilities in order to survive.<br />This book, despite some small awkwardness in style is definitely a keeper.e other local leaders because they do not recognize Runa as a proper Mantic despite her possession of two horses and her undoubted skill at sorcery.<br />This is the story of how Runa and her barbarian come to terms with one another and with the requirments of being burdened by responsibility for other people.

Dragon Bones is more sprawling, its action covering a vast area as it moves from the small, impoverished estate of Hurog to the king's court to the front of an undeclared war in an unprotected land.<br />Fenwyck, the lord of Hurog, was half mad.  He abused his wife, his children, his servants and his animals.  His wife hid in a haze of drugs.  His daughter was mute.  His youngest son had run away and was presumed dead.  His heir, Wardwyck, was thought to be brain damaged since Fenwyck had beaten him nearly to death at the age of 12.  As the reader is told on nearly the first page, though, Ward was no fool at all and had used his supposed imbecility to escape his father's abuse.  Ward had lost his power of speech after the beating, had lost his ability to use magic to any great degree, had been forced to learn to reuse the left side of his body, but was not in the least stupid.  He was a large young man, though with bovine eyes and a practiced look of stupidity.<br />When the story opens Ward is returning from an expedition which had taken him to the monumental bronze doors of Hurog, set in a mountain side, they had wrought on them images of a dragon.  He overhears a discussion between his twin cousins Which leads him to conclude that they had been teasing his sister and she had taken refuge in the sewers of the castle.  Determined to protect his sister from his father's wrath should she not present herself for dinner, he undertakes to find her in the tunnels underlying the castle.<br />When he does locate her, he also finds evidence that an ancestor of his had muzzled and chained a dragon in a cavern under the keep.  He and his sister escape to the surface.  Before, however, he can decide what to do about the remains of the dragon, he is told that his father is dying, thrown by his stallion during a hunt. He is approached by the family ghost who passes to him the platinum ring that is the symbol of lordship.<br />His father, with his last strength declares that his brother Duraugh will have control over Hurog during Ward's minority.  Ward is afraid that his uncle will want to keep control and begins his own campaign to win over the victims, mundane and supernatural of his father's abuse.<br />Slowly, Ward starts to reveal that he is not as stupid as he has appeared over the years, but he is afraid to reveal everything to his uncle.  Just as he decides to do so, though, two lords from the king's court arrive chasing an escaped slave.  By ancient custom if a slave reached Hurog that slave was afterward free.  Ward and Duraugh refuse to give up the slave and the lord's reveal that they have authorization from the king to confine Ward in a lunatic assylum.<br />Thus begins an adventure where Ward is forced to prove himself suitable to rule Hurog after all, protect his siblings and escape entrapment in the toils of politics.  Ward's story, told in first person, is interwoven with the story of his twin cousins, the story of the King's favorite, and a threat from a neighboring kingdom.<br />Ms Briggs does a very good job of characerization.  Just as the reader thinks he or she has the characters neatly pigeonholed, the author reveals some other aspect. Nothing is as it seems.  There are betrayals and murders.  Ward finds his magic again, but magic is not enough.<br />While the conclusion is satisfying, it is noted in the back that the author is working on a sequel, which will hopefully be published soon.

After all, his motive for killing was bizarre to say the least-- he wanted to keep the men he picked up from leaving him. Then a few years later I picked up Brian Masters' Killing for Company almost by chance-- It was shocking: here was Dahmer's mirror image in a quiet British civil servant named Dennis Nilson. For some reason his crimes had not been publicized in the US.<br />Nilson's crimes had been discovered in 1983 when the plumbing in his apartment buildng started to back up. Workmen were called in and discovered what looked like human flesh was the problem. The police questioned Nilson who confessed to his crime. He had been actively killing young men for 4 years and using their bodies in bizarre tableaus of domesticity and no one had noticed--would probably not have noticed had it not been that his plumbing couldn't handle his method of body disposal.<br />Masters' book does a very good job of laying out Nilson's life. It is definitely not a quickie books churned out to take advantage of a sensational crime. If you are at all interesed in the darkest, most tabu areas of the human soul this is a very interesting read.	2002-02-20

These problems included corruption and mismanagement by the previously appointed governor, famine, disease and unchecked supernatural threats decimating the population. Many of the inhabitants still feel they owed allegiance to the Forest King, the heir of their deposed monarch.<br />Tevra, aided by her loyal and able second in command, Captain Hetwith, finds herself under magical and physical attack as she deals with bandits and less mundane threats. She had also not counted on the personal attraction she would feel for Prince Dard, the ci-devant Forest King, or the change in Hetwith's previously impeccable behavior toward her. She had, many years previously, taken Hetwith on as a soldier with a less than stellar reputation and by careful handling created a reliable tactician and her most valuable resource. She feels quite lost when his behavior causes a rift between them. Competent as she might be in military matter, Tevra has little experience in understanding her own emotions.<br />The character of Tevra as a career military officer who has been a very \\"by the rules\\" player, is well worked out. Her insecurities and strengths are both displayed as she copes with situations that threaten both her life and her loyalties. Her relationship with Hetwith, who she trusts implicitly to save her life, but whose inner workings confound her, is interesting. Their relationship as commanding officer and subordinate and the conflicts that arise in it are in keeping with both of their characters.<br />I can't comment on the military aspects of the book from experience, but from the presence of Jenny, the striker, to the uniform, the feel was very British colonial rather than American.<br />I have no idea what happened that this author stopped publishing, but that she did was fantasy's loss.an American.<br />I have no idea what happened that this author stopped publishing, but that she did was fantasy's loss.	2002-02-16

The Spinster in this book is Gillian, twenty-nine, possessor of &quot;an easy competance&quot;, who still allows her family to treat her like an unpaid servant.  Further, they have no hesitation in sending her to London in an unsafe leaking landau driven by an incompetent tippling groom. (Wait a minute, isn't a landau an open carriage with hoods at both ends drawn by two horses?)  Who is telling this story?  You or Ms. Stuart?  This landau is a closed traveling carriage drawn by four horses.  However, it doesn't much matter because it is in the ditch by page 12, having been put there in part by &quot;a smaller carriage traveling at a stupendous pace.&quot;<br />Inside the second carriage is the Rake.  The Rake is a former black sheep of the family who was cast off at age twenty to wander the continent gambling and doing whatever else rakes do.  Then in one of those streaks of bad luck noble families in Regency romances often suffer, a number of his male relatives are killed off and he finds himself inheriting the marquisate.  Now he has come home to assume his role as head of his family and to open a gaming hell with his best friend.  (But if he has inherited a fortune why does he want to open a gaming hell?)  Hush, it's one of the things rakes do.<br />It is worth noting that the Rake and His Friend are both not quite sober.  The Spinster decides that rather than waiting with her overturned leaky landau, she would climb into a coach with two strange, intoxicated men and catch a ride to London.<br />Of course she manages to pique the Rake's interest, of course there is a decades old rivalry between the Rake and Gillian's brother, of course the two men, once Gillian is out of the carriage, lay a wager about whether Gillian would &quot;fall under the fabled Marlowe charm.&quot;<br />Gillian has a niece in London named Felicity.  Felicity is in love with a poor minister who seems to be running the Regency version of a Salvation Army mission and soup kitchen.  He could use a cook because the the soup is described as disgusting enough to make Felicity unable to eat for 24 hours after she smells it.  Felicity and Liam (the poor minister) have a disagreement about whether Felicity wants to marry him and do good works or have lots of pretty dresses and not be made sick by the smell of bad soup.  She points out that there are worse things that could happen than marriage to a poor man and stalks off.<br />Meanwhile it is Gillian's birthday, but everyone has forgotten it.  Gillian's nephew, Bertram, who has been sitting around looking morose and twitching every time someone mentions gambling debts, and Felicity decide to help Gillian celebrate.  They get dressed up, drink too much champagne. Felicity goes to sleep and Bertram and Gillian decide to go out.  Where shall they go?  Oh, yes, didn't a new gaming hell just open up?  Of course they should go there.<br />Clearly Ms Stuart didn't do her homework.  There's echoes of Georgette Heyer's Black Sheep, Venetia and Grand Sophy, but none of Heyer's wit and plotting skill.  The story simply wanders around looking for a conclusion.  I have no idea how this book ever garnered the reputation it has.

His wife had died after producing one child, Eliza. Eliza was reared by various relatives then consigned by her father to Mrs. Winlock, a impecunious widow, to be presented to society. Mrs. Winlock immediately fixed on a young baronet with a need for money and a dragon of a mother as the most likely way of getting Eliza off her hands.<br />Eliza took a hard look at her staid and poker stiff prospective suitor, hacked off her hair, put on the hall boy's best suit of clothes and fled London desguised as a youth on his way home to Bath. It was Eliza's intention to seek refuge with a great aunt there. However, she had the misfortune to have her pocket picked at an inn and the innkeeper was rather menacingly demanding payment. This is where the story opens.<br />Enter Mr. Redmayne. Mr. Redmayne, a young man of impeccable appearance, stupendous wealth and great competence, happened to be breakfasting at the same inn. He rescues Eliza, who introduces herself as Mr. Smith, and invites her to join him at breakfast. However, he quickly penetrates her disguise and offers to help her on her reach.<br />Returned to England from India after an absence of two years, Mr. Redmayne was in pursuit of a woman, Corinna Mayfield, he had glimpsed on the prior occasion and fallen in love with at first sight. However, despite his vast wealth, inherited from an associate in India, he does not have an entre into society. Eliza does.  It is his idea after he hears Eliza's story that Eliza needs to return to London, face up to Mrs. Winlock and then tell Edward that she will not marry him. It was Mrs. Winlock's intention to spend the summer at Brighton, where Corinna Mayfield would also be spending time. Mr. Redmayne plans that Eliza should introduce him to Corinna.<br />However, Mr. Redmayne besides being handsome, rich and accomplished has a mysterious secret that could ruin him socially and prevent him ever forming a connection with Corinna. The question is, does he really want to form that connection, or was there a better one in the offing?<br />This one is handled with a very light hand.

When the story opens the first and third daughter are respectably engaged.  The oldest, Gwendolen has contracted a marriage with a naval captain-- in large part because she admired Lord Nelson.  The youngest is set to marry her childhood sweetheart.  They have just learned that the middle daughter, Jane, the acknowledged Beauty, is about to receive a very advantageous offer from a gentleman she met during her Season in London, the Marquis of Lyndale, who is coming to ask her father's permission to pay his addresses to her.<br />Mr. Quarters observed, &quot;I've never held with marquisates.  A jumped up sort of title.  Earls and barons were good enough for us in the old days.&quot;  Which would have done very well had Mr. Quarters stuck to this position, because Jane is in love with the impoverished but beautiful French emigre secretary of the Duke of Tardiff.  However, Mr. Quarters is also a wastral, and very heavily indebted to the notorious moneylenders Messers Smith and Brown.  Therefore even a Marquis with fifty thousand pounds a year is not to be whistled down the wind.<br />Into this situation Lyndale arrives with a flash of carriage wheels, sending Gwendolen who happened to be strolling along the same narrow lane tumbling into a ditch to avoid being run down.  This is symbolic of the way in which everyone's neat plans are overturned.<br />Jane is such a dutiful thing that if not managed correctly she might accept the Marquis as a well of salvaging the family fortunes.  Gwendolen discovers that her handsome heroic captain is really a pompous bore.  Campaspe, the third daughter, in an effort to save Jane alienates her fiance.  It hardly seems that all will come right in the end.<br />The main problem with the book and the reason I would have given it 3 1/2 stars instead of 4 if it were possible, was that Ms. Darcy has a problem getting all of her lovers situated for the denouement.  In fact the strategem is downright silly.  However, there are enough fun moments in this book to make up for this.<br />One of the things that I think might disturb readers used to recent Regency romances, is that the plot is not so much two people coming to understand they are in permanent ecstatic love, blah, blah, blah.  The plot instead involves overcoming all of the obstacles: familial, financial and social that stand between two people coming to an understanding.  Ms. Darcy is also really very knowledgeable about the Regency period, from the price of a post chaise to how bets were placed at a race, but her plots could have used a stronger editorial hand.em is downright silly.

The lead character, Shann Lantee, is the lowest ranking member of a survey team. When the team is attacked he escapes with two trained wolverines into the wilderness that is Warlock where he discovers the race of Wyvern who excel in illusions.<br />Ordeal in Otherwhere was Andre Norton's first juvenile where the the lead character was female. I understand her publisher was dubious about the idea. He shouldn't have been-- there was a population of readers who was ready to share the adventures of her heroine.<br />Brought to Warlock as a slave to communicate with the Wyvern who will not deal with men, Charis Nordholme finds herself stranded. However, there is more than surviving in a low tech world to worry about. The Wyverns, the warlock natives, are undergoing social unrest and a questioning of their matriarchal values as the Wyvern males attempt to throw off the control of the Wyvern matriachs.<br />One of Norton's enduring themes-- the ills of polarization of a society and the strength to be found in pulling together rather than pulling against one another, is worked out in these two books. The Wyverns, because of inequities in their society. have opened the door to greedy offworld interests, who definitely do not have the good of the Wvyerns at heart.<br />Forerunner Foray only has a tangential connection to the first two novels.  It was published about ten years later, but it is still an entertaining book about Ziantho, an employee of the Thieve's Guild, who during a covert raid stumbles onto a Forerunner gem which she is mysteriously drawn to, as she is drawn to the esper, Ris Lantree, who \\"hears\\" her first attempt to discover the secret of the gem by mental power.<br />The gem is a focus of power belonging to a long dead race and they find themselves fleeing across space and time as they follow the history of the gem back to it's beginning. Altogether a darker book, but well worth reading.	2002-02-08

Not for her the romantic starts of misses out of the schoolroom.  She knows exactly what she wants:  a man with a good fortune.  All else, she feels is negotiable.<br />Lydia, with her brother and her grandmother have left a decaying plantation in the Louisiana bayou country to come to London obstentibly to claim an inheritance left to her grandmother.  In reality she and her brother are on the look out for a way to improve their situation in life-- or at least prevent the need to return to Louisiana.  Lydia and her brother are attractive and accomplished.  Their social success is assured-- that is, if Lydia can keep her grandmother and brother from social ruin while skillfully casting her net for a wealthy husband.<br />One of the high points of this book is the hero.  Unlike Mr. Ranleigh in Cecily who was stated to be irresistible to women but whose presentation was harsh at best, the Viscount in Lydia is shown to have actual charm of manner and style.  His unexpected ascension to the peerage allows him to view the town scene as an outsider while giving him the right to participate.<br />All in all a very pleasurable read.<br />P.S.  I'm not sure why anyone would think there was supposed to be any doubt about who the hero was-- well maybe if the reader had never read a Regency or any other type of genre romance.  It was quite clear from the moment he steps on the stage that here is hero material of the finest kind.	2002-02-04

She was slipping more information into the intereaction of the characters rather than long paragraphs of exposition.<br />This novel had an unusual hero for it's time (or indeed since).  He is the illegitimate son of an Earl, who had been raised with the Earl's own children and given the task of running the Earl's estates.  After his father died he did not get along with the new heir so he was set on finding a new post.  Instead he chanced to meet an Irish heiress, marry her and go journeying on the continent.<br />When the novel opens, the heiress is dead (within a year of their marriage) and her estate has passed to the widower's hands adding the reputation of fortune hunter to his own significant social disabilities.  He is expected at any moment to arrive and claim his estate.  Meanwhile the relation who had been in charge of the estate in the absense of its owners, has let things get very much out of hand.  The Bailiff has the accounts in a muddle, the Butler has been in the Madeira and Arabella, who should have removed herself and her son months ago, has complicated the matter by inviting a young cousin, who was by way of being an heiress herself, to visit in the hopes that she would make a match with her son Brandon.<br />Georgina, who was sent to Ireland in disgrace because she would not marry a suitor approved by her tartar of a grandmother, is a headstrong miss with decided ideas about honor and family feeling.  She is quite determined to support her cousins against this interloper.  But when the interloper does appear to have some finer qualities she finds herself championing him against the prejudices of the neighborhood worthies instead.<br />Unfortunately the heroine is 18 and her social sense is not yet developed.  Her attempts at bringing Mr. Shannon into the County society are more well meaning than successful.<br />This book still bears reading.  The Regency era is more than wallpaper to the story.  The characters are interesting.  And if I spent a certain amount of time wanting to shake Georgina, it has to do with the 30 years that have passed since I last read this book, rather than any lack of skill on the author's part.  I have the same reaction to most of my friends' children at that age.g.  The Regency era is more than wallpaper to the story.  The characters are interesting.

There are huge blocks of expostion that might have been been better broken up into actual dialogue, but the writing is clear and grammatical and mainly a pleasure to read.<br />The story begins with Robert Ranleigh visiting the theatre at the invitation of a hopeful Mama whose daughter had been lately receiving marked attention from him.  Mr. Ranleigh, untitled but wealthy and well connected, is the quintessential regency beau-- the complete to a shade dresser, a dab hand at the reins, a lady's man and a crack shot.  Of course, for most of this, particularlly the lady's man part, we have to take the writer's word for it.  He presents himself as high handed, proud, and not sensitive at all.  He also clearly has problems understanding his own feelings.  On one hand, he is rather coldbloodedly contemplating marriage with a woman he does not care for and who he \\"knows\\" is not capable of a deep emotional attachement.  On the other, he capable of quixotically involving himself in the affairs of a complete stranger.<br />The heroine, Cecily, is about 13 years his junior.  She was raised by her aunt, a lady of strong mind, and an alcoholic, gamester father.  Her father dead and his entire estate taken for debt, Cecily and her aunt find themselves in dire straits with no more than the clothes on their backs.  Fortuitously, they meet Mr. Jilson, an actor,who sees in Cecily his ticket to fortune.  By mentoring her on the stage, he hopes to cash in on her striking looks.<br />Cecily, appearing in the play that night, proves immediately popular with the young male section of the play going population which leads directly to a wager among certain of the young bucks, that Mr. Ranleigh would not be able to convince Cecily to come to dinner with him.  Instead he ends up meeting Cecily and her aunt at the inn where they are staying the next day and discovers that Cecily is a connection of his by marriage.<br />In his typical high handed fashion Ranleigh decides to remove Cecily from the stage and try to find her some respectable occupation.  The first thought that occurs to him is to try to shame her disagreeable, disreputable, pinchpenny uncle into giving her a home.  When this does not work out, he convinces his mother to involve herself in trying to educate Cecily for the role of governess and find her a situation.<br />The plot then plays itself out in not unexpected fashion with the interference of various relatives, servants and a melodramatic (and thoroughly despicable villain).  The secondary characters for the most part are well drawn.  It might have been nice to see more of Ranleigh coming to terms with his feelings and maybe suffering a bit more.  However, the good end happily and the bad end unhappily as the reader would expect and it's a very pleasant ride getting there.his by marriage.  <br />In his typical high handed fashion Ranleigh decides to remove Cecily from the stage and try to find her some respectable occupation.

This is romance's loss.  Deana James took chances in her books.  She did not simply rehash the last historical romance by Johanna Lindsey or Jude Deveraux.  Her characters are well drawn and her plotting, although intentionally melodramatic, is original.  Her books are also multi-layered.<br />The heroine of Crimson Obsession is the only child of a Scottish earl who blew his brains out after he wasted his fortune at the gaming table.  Left alone to make her way, she disguises herself as a much older woman and seeks employment in London as a housekeeper.  Unfortunately, there is an shortage of available positions and she is nearing dispair when she is offered a position as housekeeper to the owner of a gaming house who lives in half of the house and runs a gaming hell in the other half.  This is particularly ironic because she blames gaming houses for her father's end and her own situation.<br />The hero is not at all well born.  He is the son of a prostitute, who was taught by one of his mother's clients, a well educated man before his descent into a gin sodden haze.  By dint of this teaching and his acquisition of a library thrown out by an ignorant landlord, he rose from street brat to the lofty eminence of gaming house keeper and writer of pornographic novels.  By day he writes, in the evening he makes theatrical appearances in the gaming hell as one of the devil's minions presiding over a fake orgiastic black mass.  He's bored by the whole thing and really just wants a reliable housekeeper to get his home back in shape.<br />I'm not going to describe the plot further, but if you are interested in how the son of a street prostitute and the daughter of an impecunius earl comes to terms with one another, you should read this book.<br />While it is definitely romantic fantasy and there are cliches galore, the fantasy is fun and the cliches are more often than not stood on their head for the entertainment of the reader.the fantasy is fun and the cliches are more often than not stood on their head for the entertainment of the reader.	2002-02-01

Charles Brandon was Henry's close friend and his emotional relationship with Henry's youngest sister began while they were both at Court between her 14th and 19th years.<br />A pawn in her brother's dynastic efforts, she was married at the age of 19 to the king of France, Louis XII, who was then in his 50's. He did not long survive the marriage though. Mary was forced into seclusion in order to determine if she was pregnant by the deceased king, her English waiting women were dismissed and she began to fear for her future.<br />Henry sent his old friend to France to bargain for the return of Mary and her jewels, plate, etc. With this, the situation becomes even more convoluted, because it would be in the French interest to have their Dowager Queen married to an Englishman and not one of the Hapburg Princes.<br />While Charles Brandon is not a wholly admirable man, he was certainly an interesting one and the story of his relationship with Mary Tudor makes for some lively reading.  Mary was just as determined to have her own way in love as Henry VIII, and was more successful in getting it.	2001-11-05

Wolf Hunt<br />combines a medieval setting and characters with Breton fantasy to<br />create a very satisfying read.<br />Based on the Lai de Bisclavret by the 12th century poet Marie de<br />France, Ms. Bradshaw takes the theme of the shape changer and<br />populates the story with interesting characters.  The heroine, Marie<br />Penthieve of Chalandrey, is the inmate of a convent when she hears<br />that her brother is dead.  This means that she is the heir to<br />Chalandrey, a rich manor in a strategic area between Brittany and<br />Normady.

Meanwhile there appears in the village a wolf with more than<br />natural abilities, a wolf that Alain is determined to hunt down and<br />destroy.<br />Marie, in the meantime, is trying to think of a way to prevent<br />herself from becoming a bone of contention between Duke Robert and<br />Duke Hoel, mourning Tiarnan and keeping at bay the attentions of<br />Alain's older and more honorable cousin.<br />Then Alain sends to Duke Hoel and suggests that he might enjoy<br />hunting the extraordinary wolf that is stalking Tiarnan's former<br />lands.<br />This is a book that can keep a reader up all night.  The harshness of<br />Medieval life is not overplayed, but it is also not downplayed.

I have read two:  The Tragedy at Tiverton and The Thomas Street Horror.  Both are based on true crimes which took place in New York in the early/mid 19th century and both, unfortunately, are out of print though you should be able to find them in most libraries.<br />I recently reread The Thomas Street Horror because I had finally finished a book about the crime that this novel was based on:  The Murder of Helen Jewett by  Patricia Cohen.  Helen Jewett (AKA Dorcas Doyen and many other pseudonyms) was a young popular prostitute working in New York City.  Early on the morning of April 10, 1836 she was discovered murdered in her smouldering bed.  Suspicion fell on one of her clients,  a young clerk, who was eventually tried for the murder.  Cohen's book deals not just with the crime and trial but also the attitudes toward prostitution, tabloid journalism (the murder became a nationwide sensation) and the criminal justice system.  While the book is very interesting, it is also hard going at times because the author would pause the narrative to delve into the fine points of various aspects of life during the period-- for instance I learned a lot more about the state of Maine than I would normally be interested in.  I actually put it down for several months before I  finished it.<br />The Thomas Street Horror is a much livelier, if fictionalized, account of the murder.  The veiwpoint character is a young reporter who has just arrived in New York City in November 1835 with a letter of introduction to the proprieter of the journal, the Sun, Benjamin Day.  New York journalism at the time was not concerned as much with reporting the news as garnering readers by any method available including elaborate hoaxes and pandering to mob mentality.  And the competition between the papers becomes red hot, as they choose up sides as to whether or not Helen Jewett was a wronged woman driven into her way of life or a degraded harpy who preyed on her young clients and was the young clerk accused of her murder guilty or not?  David Cordor (the journalist) is caught up in the center of events, both reporting on and participating in what was happening.  The fictional investigation into the events surrounding the murder is lead by Lon Quincannon, Paul's Irish attorney-detective who first made his appearance in The Tragedy at Tiverton.  Quincannon finds himself not just defending his client against the state, whose minions have no qualms about manufacturing evidence to support their case, but also against public opinion.<br />If you enjoy 19th century mayhem then I would definitely urge you to try this book.preyed on her young clients and was the young clerk accused of her murder guilty or not?

However, it also tended to make me go Eeeeuuuuwwwwww too often. I have a pretty high tolerance for nontraditional sex. I've enjoyed books where humans and nonhumans have relationships, even explicitly described sexual relationships, but this was a little too close to the bestiality edge for me to be completely comfortable with it. Which is odd because the hero is obviously sentient, and not an animal in the zoological sense at all. However, he certainly doesn't use his intelligence when it comes to sex-- apparently none of his species does.<br />As for the science fiction-- well, it's pretty hackneyed. Aliens who are last of their species and looking to propagate by kidnapping earthwomen used to be standard drive-in fare. Rush does not do anything to improve on that plot.<br />This book did not remind me of Beauty and the Beast-- not even-- (shudder) the Disney version. It reminded me more of the 3rd film of a triple feature in 1979 or maybe something that the MST3K cast would have enjoyed riffing on.	2001-09-11

The overwrought purple prose, the excessive digressions into 19th century minutiae, the classic &quot;gothick&quot; plot reminded me of both the gothic novels published in the mid victorian era-- LeFanu's Uncle Silas, anyone?  and the then current gothic romance market.<br />The beautiful pale Robert Whyte trips as lightly though this book as any nightgown clad governess clutching a candle, Donough is a master of brooding, more effective than most Owner of Gloomy Old Mansions, and their romance, littered with misunderstandings, has nearly every cliche belonging to the genre.  If ever there was a couple who deserved to be together!<br />I am very happy to see it back in print so I can at last replace my tattered old Avon copy.	2001-06-14

Her books tend to have a satisfying combination of action and emotion.<br />In this fantasy magic creatures (wildlings) were bound by Bloodmages who receive their power from death and suffering.  However this also brings madness and one day the binding is released by an insane bloodmage causing both physical upheaval of the landscape and social upheaval.<br />The heroine is mage born which means that she has some limited ability to see the future before the unbinding. Afterwards the presence of magic in the earth increases the scope of her powers. Had she been discovered before the unbinding she would have been either killed by the Bloodmages in search of power or killed by fanatical anti-mage elements in her village.  Afterwards, because of the circumstances the villagers find themeselves in, she is grudgingly accepted.<br />Within the first chapter her life is turned upside down by raiders.  She sets out on a quest for vengeance and to save her people.<br />One of the wildlings that has reappeared is the Hob, the last of his kind, who has the ability to help the villagers, if he could find some one of them who would be willing to accept the Hob's Bargain.<br />The lessons the heroine (and others) learn along the way are not preachy but sincere.  There is a good dollop of humor and a nice touch of romance.<br />Briggs is definitely growing as a fantasy author. She deserves a wider audience-- and more publicity (hear me, Ace?) In fact I enjoy her books more than I have enjoyed more ballyhooed books by some of the bigger names in fantasy.  Let's have some more, soon.	2001-06-05

This book is generally disliked by people who read genre romances because it doesn't fit in any of the tidy pigeon holes that romance has become.  It is wildly imaginative, wonderfully exuberant and not afraid to take chances.<br />I sincerely wish that she had written more like this before becoming absorbed into the romance mainstream.	2001-05-15

This book is one of the best fiction accounts of the time and culture that I have read.<br />The Mayan culture is very alien to our ways and mores, and yet the author has managed to make it very accessible.  While one may cringe at the idea of someone voluntarily going to a bloody and painful death in order to bring good fortune to the city, this book does an excellent job of portraying the necessity and the response of the people involved.<br />Sky Knife, the hero, takes on the roll of the Detective who must search out the root of the bad luck the city is suddenly plagued with in order to restore order and harmony.  A naieve young man at the beginning, he must learn to think outside the cultural box, as the reader must as well to fully appreciate this book.<br />I haven't read the sequel yet, but I've ordered it and am awaiting it breathlessly.	2001-05-07

This one really doesn't.  There's the trademark cute and intelligent animals, the wisewoman (wysen-wyf, a title that kept giving me a mental image of one of those dried apple dolls), the Sulcar--uh, Sea-Rovers, and some palace intigue.  But honestly there was too much happening and the authors did not draw it all together. The book lacked a sense of &quot;place&quot; which never happened with Witch World.  It was very hard to get a sense of when the actions were occurring in relation to one another.  And none of characters seem to come into focus.<br />I really had to push myself to finish this book, which has never happened with a book that Ms. Norton has done alone, and I really don't care what happens in the rest of the proposed series.<br />Guess I'll just have to wait for the second Edgehill/Norton book due out this month.  I thought Shadow of Albion was a real feast and I'm eagerly awaiting the next one.	2001-02-18

They were fun space romps with some nice twists.  This ebook has the same feel.<br />This is the future of Free Traders, Interstellar Patrol and Space Empires which should be familiar to those of us who grew up on Andre Norton. Cyn, the former Free Trader, has opted for security and a job with Overstars Mail.  Up until this trip things have been wonderfully peaceful.  But on this trip he has an unprecedented six passengers and a beast in a case, which turns out to be an innocent appearing, but less than innocent acting, failed nymph.  There's also a hint of Imperial politics, threats of space pirates and someone trying to take control of the ship.	2001-01-03

I hate the idea of  being cold, unwashed and underfed.  From my comfortable middleclass couch though I love to travel with her characters through the dreadful underbelly of their society.

Ms. Borchardt does a wonderful job in this book of drawing together Pagan and Christian sources.  She reaches into Celtic lore, 9th century chistian belief, shamanic ritual and Germanic myth to create a world where religion and forces of nature are in flux.  Part of this is the sacred marriage between the male and female principles (hieros gamos).  The various sexual acts in this story illustrate the uses of sex from the sacred to the profane.  That's not to say they aren't fun-- because they are.  But they are an integral and interesting part of the story.<br />It's not necessary that the reader know a lot about 9th century France, shamanism or pagan myth, but it doesn't hurt.	2000-11-21

I don't want angst, I don't want &quot;problem stories&quot;, I want a tale of fun characters working out a humorous solution to a social situation. This is one such book.<br />Miss Tolliver was well pleased with her life at 28.  She had a comfortable home near Yorkshire that she shared with her slightly batty Aunt Henrietta and her aunt's pet rooster, Lazarus.  She had a comfortable fortune safely invested by brother Charles, who was a dreadful stick in the mud, but reliable where money was concerned.<br />The Earl of Manseford was the eldest of four brothers.  When his third brother, Gillian was sent down from school due to a prank involving a pig, a nightshirt and a nob, he felt he should play the heavy.  This led to Gillian trying to think of some way to improve his brother's mood and drawing his younger brother Peter into a madcap scheme to kidnap an actress for his brother.<br />When the coach they accost is found not to contain an actess but Miss Tolliver, when the coachman shoots Gillian, when Peter comes down with a dreadful fever, when the inn they repair to is descended upon by the Earl, the dowager Countess, and the second eldest brother John as well as Miss Tolliver's brother Charles and the decidedly unwelcome Chuffy Marletonthorpe, all kinds of possibilities open up including a spurious engagement that the parties, all too soon begin to wish was real.<br />The writing is not overplayed.  The plot is outrageous but rarely descends to slapstick.  The eccentrics are nicely presented although the aunts Cassandra (a hypochondriac) and Caroline (who thinks tea the cure for all ills) are probably too much of a good thing, this book is head and shoulder above any regency I've read this past year and maybe long.<br />Run and find a copy and enjoy!	2000-10-29

But she has been having problems lately.  Someone has been hacking both LadyTech and her own computers-  She has also been having  blackouts that make her question her own sanity.  Then one of her partners  brings in Brodie Maxwell as a computer consultant and BJ's own personal  body guard.<br />Only BJ has no idea that she is caught in the middle of a  battle that has been going on for 800 years.  On one side is Brodie who has  been fighting for the right for 800 years.  On the other is-- well it's  easy enough to guess but I won't tell.  In fact, that's the whole problem  with this book.  The plot is relatively new to romance but it's been around  the block a few times.  The assumption seems to be that romance readers  will forgive  anything as long as the romance is there.  Well they don't.  And just to prove it, there is one real historical howler in here that  jarred me out of the story-- the hero makes BJ milky tea, just like his  mother made him.  800 years ago in England?  I don't think so.	2000-07-25
US	51741466	R1OX6LZOYTSTJA	0446401994	665599752	Strawgirl	Books	4	22	23	N	N	A Book About Survivors	I don't know how the novel of crime (no use calling it a mystery because this book does not follow the standard mystery format of crime, suspects, detective discovers identity of criminal, at all) has become a favored  method by which writers examine society.  It probably says something about  our society that here the killer and the bureaucrats seem equally souless.<br />Abigail Padgett has a message.  The message is that the mentally ill are  more often the victims than the perpetrators of criminal acts.  Her  positive characters are all survivors.  Bo, her main character is a manic  depressive, the sole surviving member of her family.  Eva Boussard, a  psychiatrist, is the survivor (so far) of breast cancer.  Rombo is a  surviver of alcoholism and hatred by his father.  Andy became a  pediatrician after his daughter drowned due to neglect.<br />And all of  these people go on doing the best that they can, sometimes getting side  tracked from their own purposes because of their basic humanity in an  effort to save a little girl whose sister was raped and whose mother  committed suicide, free an innocent man and stop the real killer.  And they  do it with grace, humor and much humanity.<br />Highly recommend.	2000-06-25

When a mystery writer leaves major loose ends I always feel cheated, as I did here.  Where was the body all that time?  And why didn't the murderer search or destroy the house  during the years it was empty?  Why didn't Paul Fischer make some better  provision for getting his secret out before he died-- it wasn't as if he  died suddenly and without warning?<br />Because this was a first novel some  mistakes are forgivable, but I would wish the editor had been a little more  on her toes when it came to catching these things.<br />I did have a favorite  character though and I don't think he got enough space.  Warren the  unrepentent Trekkie politician gave me the only laugh outloud moment in the  book.	2000-06-06

I mean I wanted to be able to rave about it as the most wonderful mystery of the year.  (D. R. Meredith has written mysteries in her other two series that are on my keeper shelf.)  But I can't.<br />It's a very workmanlike job.  The hero and heroine are  both attractive, interesting people but you may be somewhat puzzled about  their relationship if you haven't read the first book in this series.  And  I don't think the instructions for making string figures are quite the  right hook for a mystery.  I used to own the wonderful Dover reprint of  String Figures and How to Make Them which plays such a prominent role in  this story, and I could probably still do some of the easier and  intermediate ones.  But I evidently don't have the ability to translate the  instructions for string figures that start each chapture into a visual  image.  At least when the author includes recipes I can salivate over them.  I skipped the string figure instructions.<br />The part of this book that  works best are the quirky characters and the intereaction between the main  characters.  The part that works least is the mystery.  I really didn't  care about the murder victims and many of the suspects weren't strongly  drawn.  I kept hurrying through the detecting bits to get back to the funny  parts.<br />Read it if you are a D. R. Meredith fan, read it if you like  quirky fun people, read it if you like string figures but cross your  fingers and hope that there are going to be more and better books in this  series.<br />(The author does an amusing plug for one of her own books and I  agree, let's get the &quot;Murder By&quot; series back in print.)	2000-05-19

After all, his motive for killing was bizarre to say the least-- he wanted to keep the men he picked  up from leaving him.  Then a few years later I picked up Brian Masters'  Killing for Company almost by chance-- It was shocking: here was Dahmer's  mirror image in a quiet British civil servant named Dennis Nilson.  For  some reason his crimes had not been publicized in the US.<br />Nilson's  crimes had been discovered in 1983 when the plumbing in his apartment  buildng started to back up.  Workmen were called in and discovered what  looked like human flesh was the problem.  The police questioned Nilson who  confessed to his crime.  He had been actively killing young men for 4 years  and using their bodies in bizarre tableaus of domesticity and no one had  noticed--would probably not have noticed had it not been that his plumbing  couldn't handle his method of body disposal.<br />Masters' book does a very  good job of laying out Nilson's life.  It is definitely not a quickie books  churned out to take advantage of a sensational crime.  If you are at all  interesed in the darkest, most tabu areas of the human soul this is a very  interesting read.	2000-04-09

By continuing to do their job in the midst of intolerable  conditions, Ty and LaRue show that order can triumph over chaos, that there  is some hope of resolution of the larger problems, and (in their loyalty to  one another) that there is some interest other than self interest.<br />The  books could best be considered police procedurals set in hell.  They  should, by the way, should be read sequentially to appreciate the evolving  nature of Ty's lycanthropy.	2000-03-20
