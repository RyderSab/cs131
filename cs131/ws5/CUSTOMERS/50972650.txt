Since I'd read 'new-age' conspiracy books, I thought it would be interesting to get an opinion from the opposite end of the spectrum.  I did not find this book to have a balanced viewpoint.  The author lumps all religious traditions that are not fundamentalist Christian, Jewish, or Moslem as evil.  I was also unsure of her definition of what individuals, organizations and belief systems qualify as the dreaded 'New Age.  However, I thought her comparison of Nazism and the New Age movement intersting though twisted.  Also, she does share an interesting perspectives on some characters in her 'new age' movement;  Creme, Alice Bailey, Maitreya, David Spangler, Jim Jones.  Buy it used.	2005-09-21

I was looking for a resource on how to create different shapes, depths and sizes of hypertufa troughs.  This book focused on fairly shallow, square troughs.  Because most of the trough photographs were in black and white, it was difficult for a beginner to visualize how a finished product should look.  Too much of the book was focused on the type of plants you can grow in troughs. I feel a trough is just a container with unique characteristics and was hoping for information on the kinds of problems trough gardners face and how to deal with those problems.  I gave the book a 3 rating because chapter 2 - 'Constructing A Hypertufa Trough' was well done. Even with the lack of color photographs in this chapter, you will know how to create a small, square trough.  If you are looking for creative trough ideas this is not the book.	2005-09-03

I appreciated that the full color photographs showed different arrangements of containers in yards, on decks, stairs, foyers, and under windows.  There were also great tips on creating or modifying 'found' objects into planting containers.  The information in the individual plant care section was sparse.  However, but there was a key to foliage and fruit colors that is important in making beautiful displays.  The strengths of this book are the ideas and photographs.  Sometimes a good picture is the only motivation you need to get started!	2005-08-27

I hope someday this book is republished because it is one of the most creative books on the use of affirmations I've read.  In addition to information about the rebirthing process, it shares a philosphy of life that includes physical immortality, \\"integrating\\" instead of releasing negative belief patterns, and the \\"ecstasy principle\\".  My favorite quote is, \\"All statements are equally true because truth is a function of context.  Everything is the way it is but 'truth' is how the mind thinks about it.  Do not mistake truth for the thing itself.\\"  That quote may sound esoteric but the book is chock full of exercises to help us recognize our personal boundaries.  Get it!	2005-07-28

I am soooo glad that I finally invested in this 12CD set! I wanted it for a long time but was hesitant because it cost a little more. Now I feel that Amazon's price is a STEAL.  There are several things I found to be unique and valuable about this tape set.  One is that Mike Dooley explains the REASONS behind many metaphysical prosperity principles in clear, everyday language which occasionally includes current slang words!  Also, his delivery of the material is upbeat yet somehow calming.  He demonstrates a deep awareness of the diversity of his audience by using terms that are recognizable across cultures.  I like the idea that each CD focuses on a different subject so I can choose my focus.  Every single CD is quality without fluff.  Overall you get the feeling that Mike Dooley is a real-life, reluctant guru who believes in real world results.

However, I do believe there is truth in SOME of the information Stewart Swerdlow's reveals in this book.  Since publication of this book, some events in his \\"Illuminati timeline\\" have happened. This book also details his PERSONAL BELIEFS on the extraterrestrial origins of the human races and his experiences with a very strange woman who dominated his life for a period of time by accessing his previous mind control programming.  There are also some very gruesome details concerning Illuminati blood and sex rituals. I am not familiar with his previous books but it seems that he has suffered in his life and this has \\"colored\\" his views on many things.  I would have given this book a 2 because it is written as if his beliefs are reality and if you don't agree, you are blind.  However, I gave this book a 3 rating because of the excellent excerpt from his wife Janet Swerdlow called \\"Belief Systems Shattered\\". If you are interested in this type of information, start with David Icke's latest book to get background on some of the stuff in this book.	2005-02-20

I feel the real value in this book is in how Joe shares his learnings and experiences with many self-growth modalities.  In the beginning of the book, Joe shares a few difficult experiences he had in his youth related primarily to his father.  Then he moves into his experiences as a follower of Rajneesh.  This is followed by his many experiences interviewing and/or participating in some of the most effective and controversial people and organizations in the human potential movement of the 70's and 80's.

I really  liked the way the book is organized by subject, rather than  chronologically.  It is so important for African American women to read  self-help books from other women of color, because our experiences are  different and our style of expression is different than mainstream America.

I highly recommend this book from the channeled group of beings who call themselves &quot;ABRAHAM&quot;.  It gives specific techniques for focusing your life energy practical and often humorous ways. I was able to use the  principle and technique called &quot;segmenting&quot; immediately.  It's  worth the price of the book to read their explanation on how we draw things  to us with one thought and push things away with another! Worth reading  over and over!	1999-10-03
