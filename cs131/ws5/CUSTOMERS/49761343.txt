They were good for everyone else, but they lacked something for Linda Howard.  To Die For made up for everything in spades!  The fact that you can tell everything that goes on through Blair's head was hilarious since she does fall into the blond stereotype at times.  I loved Ms. Howard's return to the alpha male hero where actions are suppose to speak louder than words and the fact that he tried so hard to stay on top of things made everything more endearing to read.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good story with solid characters and is enjoyable till the very last page!	2004-12-29

I loved her earlier work - the Velvet Saga was awesome, the Princess was hilarious and Sweet Liar a treasure.  I have to say that I'm getting more and more disappointed in her new work.  I can't say I enjoyed this book at all - it was confusing and very dark, but I don't think that's how it was intended.  There is no real spark or connection between any of the characters and that just makes it disturbing to read.  I recommend you borrow this at your local library and save yourself the money.	2002-10-08

Mia and Sam have a great spark that you can feel leap off the pages.  Mia tries to fight her attraction and love for Sam not just for herself, but also for the fate of the island and those she loves.  Sam on the other hand, tries to gain the trust back from the woman that he left 11 years ago and will stop at nothing, even death, to get it.  It is a delightful book and fits in well with the other two.  I could not put it down and just had to finish it the night I got it.	2002-05-31

Sarah is really strong and shows it during all the turmoil going on all around her.  I loved how Cahill woos Sarah, but was somewhat disappointed in his reaction after the second murder.  I did hope that Sarah would make Cahill try harder to win her back after the second murder...the only thing that I did not really like is the abrupt rush Ms. Howard seemed to be in towards the end of the book.  Everything just kind of tied together rather quickly and there was no time to process what had happened and then it was the end of the story.  Besides that, great read and very creepy!	2002-05-01

This story takes you on a ride of romance, greed, and most of all, intrigue.  The three siblings, Malachi, Gideon, and Rebecca are determined to reclaim their stolen Fate from the charming and deadly Anita Gaye and also find the other two Fates.  On the way, they each find someone they are drawn to and eventually realize that they cannot live without.  Tia, the mythologist, is a scared, timid, hypochondriac; Cleo, the sexy exotic dancer, and Jack, the wealthly collector who is also a securities expert-all are connect in some way to the Fates and in turn, to the siblings and each other.  This is a highly enjoyable book, and I honestly could not put this down until I was done with the last page.	2002-04-12

Ben and Jillian really get to know each other under the harshest of circumstances.  Ben, being a ruffian, usually doesn't see anything special in prim and proper types, but he can't seem to help the pull that Jillian has at him.  Great book to curl up to and get pulled away to a different land.	2002-04-08

It totally fit into the series and focused on some issues that we all wanted answered for a while.  It didn't totally give anything away and all the close calls made the ending totally sweet!  Eve and Roarke make such a great couple, it's too bad that I'm going to have to wait another 6 months for the next book to come out.  Peabody and her family are a hoot and a half.  I loved how this book started playing on Eve's little insecurities and it showed how everyone has developed in the year that Eve's been married to Roarke!  Great read and can't wait for Purity in Death! =)	2002-03-05

Here, we see the sweet side of Ripley warring with her usual sarcastic and cynical self.  No matter how much Ripley is fighting it, she can't help but fall for Mac and his awesome bod.  I cannot wait for Mia and Sam's story.  All the little inuendoes in &quot;Heaven and Earth&quot; make me want to see Sam on his hands and knees begging and pleading for Mia to let him back in her life, but that's probably not going to happen.  Can't wait for the third story!	2001-12-03

First, there's the great description that Lori Foster offers, and then there's the steamy romance undertoning the whole story.  Mick and Del are quite the couple.  The attraction felt on both sides is just leaping from the pages.  I loved the fact that the main point of view is the Mick's.  Most romance books have some male insight, but the stories usually come from the female's point of view.  The only thing I didn't like was when Mick was faced with a new dilema, he didn't find out try to ask Del, but jumped to conclusions instead and ended up hurting her.  Overall, a great book to curl up with.	2001-11-21

The love everyone feels for Brian is clear, and the terror is felt through the pages when he turns up missing.  I loved the way the characters were portrayed.  Weaknesses were shown and each character had their own little battle, internally or physcially to overcome.  Highly recommended!  I could not put this book down.	2001-11-07

What I didn't really like though was the ending when it was apparent that both sides were hiding things from each other, but only Delanie had to go and practically &quot;beg&quot; Kyle to take her back.  I didn't like this scenario.  Both characters are strong and there should have been more of a mutual surrender.  Overall, though, a great book with lots of steamy romance and &quot;spy king&quot; adventure.  Still waiting for Huntington and Taylor!	2001-10-30

The dynamics between Marc and Karen just shoot out of the pages and it feels like you're right there watching the scenes unfold.  I loved the fact that Marc was suspicious of Karen and later, totally made up for the fact that he felt that way.  An all-around good book.	2001-09-18

Her words bring such vivid pictures to mind that I can see visually everything that is going on.  I love Mike's tireless pursuit of Samantha and how he gets when he finally gets her in his arms.  It's a very touching story of finding out who you truly are and it's done best when there's someone who loves you by your side.  A definate keeper.	2001-09-07

The scenes are so realistic that you feel like you're personally there standing over the bodies.  Also, it's very refreshing to see Eve and Roarke really getting into the &quot;married&quot; life.  I especially liked the fact that certain people that belonged together made up and are together.  Louise makes another appearance and also helps in Eve's investigation.  Her reward:  finding a guy that she just might be able to love.  Overall, a great book.  Can't wait for the next in the series.	2001-09-05

I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't a book with two unrelated storylines and no romance at all.  The spark between Sherlock and Savich are toned down to the point that you don't see the great chemistry between these 2 characters.  What you see is a struggle for the author to complete and tie in two unrelated storylines with too many main characters.  This book is mainly about Savich and his sister Lily, but since Savich has Sherloch, Lily has to have Simon, her hero.  You see no romance or chemistry between Lily and Simon until the last 20 pages.  All of a sudden, there's supposedly great love between the two...wait for the paperback or just borrow this book from the library.	2001-08-12

It was filled with mystery and you can see the struggle within each character.  I was kept in suspense till the very last page.  The characters seem so real and I love the fact that they're not totally infatuated with each other that they don't see the flaws.  It's because of the fact that in spite of these flaws the characters still get together that makes me love this book.	2001-08-12

Roarke and Eve are HOT!!!  Roarke's character just keeps getting better and better.  There's this new side of him that's vulnerable and especially in this book, you can see how Roarke needs Eve just as much as she needs him.  It's such a special relationship.  What did disappoint me, but added something to the book was the relationship between Peabody and McNab.  Hopefully, we can see things resolved between the two.

The ending makes you want to flip back to the front to see which twin was doing what, and which one was actually killed.  It makes really intense reading, and although a little confusing, it evens out in the end when the guy gets the girl that he fell in love with in the beginning.  Halfway through the book, you think that the hero is a cad for loving one sister and then loving the other.	2000-12-26
