Every book so far -- and I've read and re-read them several times -- is an absolute joy. This new one is simply delightful, a master's take on the world as it is, and about the possibilities for progress, and pitfalls. One would think that a steady diet of Friedman's column would sate a reader. But here comes yet another book that's filled with fresh insights. And it's beautifully written. What a joy!	2005-04-05

And he always writes splendidly: His earlier books, \\"Journey between Two Chinas,\\" and \\"The Peking Letter,\\" were an absolute delight, and little wonder that they received much critical acclaim. His new novel, \\"Fatal Crossroads: A Novel of Vietnam 1945,\\" is certain to do well. Topping always displays a great journalist's keen historical perspective, an eye for telling detail, and a marvelously fluid writing style. For his legions of fans, and for the general reader, what a lovely gift for the New Year!	2004-12-31

But I would recommend it even if I weren't the publisher. It offers great insights into how its Indian characters (and some Americans, too) cope with a globalized world and their own inner demons. Dr. Chatterjee has a promising career as a novelist ahead of him. He's made a noteworthy start.	2003-02-27

This is a superb collection of Tom Friedman's New York Times columns, plus personal commentaries on the circumstances behind those columns since 9/11. What an extraordinarily insightful book. I couldn't put it down, even though I'd read virtually all of Friedman's columns when they first appeared in The Times. His prose is wonderfully lucid and colloquial; it helps us understand the increasingly bewildering world around us--and within us. Friedman shares his interesting and intriguing experiences with his readers, and we are all wiser and humbler for it. Read Tom Friedman, then read him all over again!	2002-08-26

No other novelistic treatment of the Middle East in recent years comes anywhere close to this book. What Ms. Wilentz offers is an insightful look at age-old causes that simply aren't amenable to conventional political and diplomatic interventions. She's captured her characters--Jews and Arabs alike--just right. What a moving book.	2001-04-16

Alex von Bidder--a co-owner along with  Julian Niccolini--has teamed up with John Mariani to write this most  enjoyable history of the 41-year-old restaurant. The book bubbles over with  rich anecdotes, it captures the social drama of New York, it tells a  delightful story of success with a touch of humor and humility. The book  is, most of all, a great read.	2000-08-28

I think he's the best political journalist around, and an immensely gifted novelist. My bias re-asserts itself in my comment about &quot;The Running Mate&quot;: It is a hugely entertaining book, very wise, very sobering, and  just beautifully written.

Not being a &quot;China hand,&quot; I expected to have difficulty with the subject matter. But  Tyler writes in a lucid, entertaining style, and his book is filled with  revealing anecdotes and cogent analysis. There's meaty historical data as  well, and a lot of contemporaneous material not publicly revealed until  now. I'm awed by Tyler's research, and by his ability to synthesize the  sheer volume and expanse of the subject matter.	1999-09-15

Earlier, he was a wonderful foreign correspondent, winning a Pulitzer Prize for his  dispatches from Poland. This book, written when he was metropolitan editor  of The Times, is about one of the most gruesome urban tragedies to occur in  New York. This book needs no review. It simply needs to be read, and its  lessons remembered by all of us.	1999-08-27

Offering rich detail and flowing prose, they  capture the ethos of The New York Times and the remarkable men and women  who own the paper, who run it, and who serve unflaggingly in the public  interest. This is a book for media followers and general readers alike. It  tells you, with carefully chosen anecdotes and trenchant analysis, how  integral The Times is to American life.	1999-08-25

Seymour Topping writes with elegance and passion, and with the kind of savvy that can only come from deep experience. He knows his China, and he knows his journalism.

Kurt Anderson's novel goes beyond being funny--it's a modern-day morality tale that should be must-reading for every careerist and also for general audiences who want to understand how our chaotic, success-obsessed society  works (or doesn't). His construction of characters is just marvelous. Good  humor is difficult to write, but Anderson has achieved a tour de force.	1999-05-07

Tom Friedman's page-turner on globalization and its consequences (and discontents) is a delightful book, one that entertains, informs and educates. I've followed Friedman's career from the time he was a  wire-service correspondent sui generis in the Middle East, and I've always  thought him to possess an extraordinary, incisive intellect. He also has a  remarkable ability to read people, places and policies quickly and  accurately. His latest book is a wonderful gift to those of us who are  already Friedman's fans--and also are concerned about understanding better  how our interdependent world is evolving. His book features not only the  victors of globalization but also its victims: it's a book with both a head  and a heart.	1999-04-24

Hard to believe that novelist-lawyer Scott Turow wrote this extraordinary book while still at Harvard Law School -- hard to believe because it was his first book, written at the end of his turbulent first year at law  school; hard to believe because his writing skills are so well developed;  and hard to believe that such a young writer could capture the environment  and ethos of a formidable institution so perfectly.

This is a tribute to America  from a loving immigrant--a man who has gained international fame as an  editor and writer, first in his native Britain and later in the United  States. Evans has produced a superb history of 20th century America, but  his book starts in the last century so as to give us a perspective on what  was to follow. The research is prodigious; the selection of photographs is  stunning; the writing is elegant and unintrusive. This is a book meant to  be savored page by page--and to be handed down as a heirloom.	1998-10-02

It's beautifully written, with rarely a slack section. Coleridge displays awesome insider's knowledge of the publishing and fashion industries, and his action scenes similarly reveal detailed familiarity with locales in Europe, New York and Hong Kong. No wonder. The author is a well-traveled writer whose previous books dealt with the fashion industry, and international  publishing tycoons. &quot;With Friends Like These&quot; is an immensely enjoyable book, with enough action and romance, and suspense, to make it a page-turner.	1998-03-05
US	53061962	R5N2Y2RMWL2C6	0679415610	262130304	The Children	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	David Halberstam is at the height of his writing power.	It is impossible to say anything about David Halberstam's books without first saying how influential his journalism has been to an entire generation of journalists in the United States and overseas. When I was a young news clerk at The New York Times a long time ago, I read Halberstam's masterly &quot;The Best and The Brightest,&quot; and I wrote him a note applauding his detailed research, the flow of his narrative, and the sheer sweep of his story. To my surprise, he responded promptly; it is a note that I still treasure -- just as I treasure every book he has written since. &quot;The Children&quot; shows Halberstam at the peak of his writing ability. He recreates the human environment of the frenetic years of the civil rights struggles, telling the extraordinary stories of some of heralded and unheralded players in a manner that is both gripping and provocative. The reader shouldn't be daunted by the length of this book (800 pages) because there isn't a single section that flags. &quot;The Children&quot; is certain to become a landmark book. It deepens our understanding of a traumatic period in American history, and illustrates vividly that ultimately all social forces and causes are shaped by individual men and women -- in this case people who battled racism and the ever-present antagonism of foes determined not to yield ground. &quot;The Children&quot; dramatizes the triumph of goodness; it is definitely a triumph of a genre that might be called histojournalism. It is a superb book by a towering writer of great sensitivity and skill.	1998-02-08

Daniel Yergin provides the reader extraordinary insight into contemporary globalization. In a masterful, sweeping work that encompasses economic and social history of the post-war era, Yergin (who won the Pulitzer Prize for &quot;The Prize,&quot; his study of the oil industry) and his co-author Joseph Stanislaw help us understand how economies around the world, but especially in the third world, are abandoning the old faith in big government and are embracing the marketplace. But Yergin and Stanislaw also warn that the marketplace -- laissez-faire -- is fraught with perils for countries that don't have sound governance and indigenous institutions and entrepreneurs who are able to function responsibly in an increasingly interdependent world. I found the book's analysis particularly lucid; the chronology at the end, which details the evolution of economic theory as well as cites political trends, should be especially useful to students. This is a book I'd recommend highly for laymen and scholars alike.	1998-01-18

Even then, as a newcomer to foreign correspondence, he impressed us all by his sharp eye for detail, his energy and his ability to make connections between people and events. His knowing, insightful &quot;A Firing Offense,&quot; to me at least, represents an extension of Ignatius' marvelous journalism in foreign-affairs which began almost two decades ago. This is a novel of truths--sad truths about the journalism business, sordid truths about the world at large, sorry truths about the way we often treat the perceived losers in life. The plot is tight, the language spare. This is a must-read for lovers of spy-fiction, but I highly recommend &quot;A Firing Offense&quot; to general readers as well. David Ignatius has already proven that he's a master of the game in journalism (his career at The Washington Post is testimony to that); now he's shown that in fiction, too, he's at the top of his craft	1997-06-02
