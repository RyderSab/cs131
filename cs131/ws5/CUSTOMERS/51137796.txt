If you are looking for something like a cookbook where the specific questions you should ask and in what order are listed, you won't like this book.  If you are looking to develop your own interview style and want to pick and choose from a variety of methods, then you will find Brady's book an excellent source of information.  Brady covers everything from getting appointments to to research to notetaking to tape recorders to knowing when the interview is over.  He shows how different people handle interviews over the phone or by letter.  When you finish this book, the choice of what questions to ask and how you should go about the interview remain up to you, but Brady's book will have given you a solid base.<br />Just about the only topic that is uncovered (due to the date of the book) is how to conduct an interview by Internet Chat.  But a smart reader can easily adapt Brady's ideas to that situation.	2002-05-22

Hogshire's book is at once a sly critique of the system as it really operates and a survival guide for anyone unfortunate enough to be caught up by \\"the machine\\".<br />The book is insightful not only for the prisoner, but for those who love him or who just want to understand the world in which he exists.  Hogshire is not a preacher who will tell you that crime does not pay:  he freely admits that you are better off simply not being caught and provides a few pointers for minimizing the risk of being passed from the streets to the prison should you be arrested, detained in the county jail, and tried.  Even following his book to the letter, he further admits, you may find yourself inexorbably shuttled through the judicial process to that most horrible of places, the modern prison.<br />At each step along the way he discusses the legal and personal risks that a convict must face including physical violence, boredom, cravings for drugs, lonliness, and self defense.  Sometimes he injects his darkly funny observations about what people try to accomplish with prison and what actually happens there.  (See, for example, his comments about the likelihood of prison rapists getting \\"some of their own medicine\\".)  I don't think this guide is just for prisoners or their families.  I think it should be read by wardens, guards, voters, and politicians so that they can understand just what kind of unnecessary hell the American legal system has created.<br />It would not surprise me if this book was banned in some penal systems to keep prisoners from getting ideas.  Though I have no intentions of committing a crime, I am glad I read this if for no other reason than I now understand how to act in the event I am arrested and how I might survive should evil compound evil and I find myself in one of the darker worlds we have created in the name of light.ad I read this if for no other reason than I now understand how to act in the event I am arrested and how I might survive should evil compound evil and I find myself in one of the darker worlds we have created in the name of light.	2002-05-20

Stevens seems to have done his fieldwork by dispatching students with questionnaires to prisons.  The result is an insightful guide into the mind of serial rapist with some compelling advice for potential victims based on his findings.  The text is hampered by numerous typos (there is more than one reference to people \\"steeling\\" for example) and a few glaring grammatical mistakes.  He does, at least, rely more on what criminals have told him than on vague statistical studies and he is no dupe.  His strength is that he understands the complicated factors that go into making a predator, the difficulty of getting them to change, and the need for better programs to protect the public from the development of such hard core abusers.  You will have a better, less slanted insight into how a rapist thinks after you read this book.  Stephens, like Lonnie Athens, dares to look at the problem head on, refute the myths and political expediencies of the past, and suggest a program for both government and individual citizens that could go a long way towards reducing the incidence of predatory rape and pedophilia.	2002-05-09

The praise for this book is telling:  rather than confirming myths, it reinforces new ones that are dear to those who believe that we act without any reference to our surroundings.  There is better work in this field on the subject of how criminals make decisions that don't lean on simplications like \\"being born bad\\" or \\"society corrupted them\\".  This one merely replaces them as evidenced by chapter titles like \\"Parents don't turn children into criminals\\" and \\"conventional wisdom:  how wise?\\"  One wonders if Samenow has spent any real time talking and listening to violent criminals (which is true about Lonnie Athens who has also addressed many of these same issues in his groundbreaking work.)  Like the liberal knee jerks he criticizes, he simplifies the criminal mind too much.  He fails to recognize that \\"no man is an island\\".  The fact is that criminals make decisions, that parents can contribute mightilly to the development of the criminal mind by the attitudes they teach them and the way they treat others around them.  Samenow's program of suggested program of \\"habilitation\\" comes out as a self-refuting denial of the main premises of the book:  if criminals can be programmed not to be violent, how did they get programmed in the first place?  One gets the feeling that he fell into the trap with the parents that many of his opposites have fallen into with the criminals:  he failed to regard their statements critically.  What he suggests, therefore, is a program that continually cleans up the mess without fixing the leak.  He lacks the moral courage to look at the whole picture, including the role that self-appointed criminal experts such as himself play in perpetuatng institutions and parenting practices that help mold the future lawbreaker.  Attitudes do not come out of nowhere as Samenow and his supporters believe:  we live in society and we teach one another.  Rather than let anyone completely off the hook, we need to have the courage to understand what Lonnie Athens calls the process of \\"violentization\\", the way in which a child, born innocent, becomes a mugger, a brawler, a rapist, or a killer.  Samenow's analysis is shallow and statistical.  For those sincerely interested in understanding the problem of violence in American society, I recommend any book by Lonnie Athens (who grew up among violent people and wondered why, after witnessing all that horror and being beaten himself, he didn't end up in prison) or Why They Kill by Richard Reeves, a biography of Athens which rejects the simplications of \\"society corrupts\\" school of criminologists and lays out an intelligent, factual, and well researched description of the many ways that a person can come to choose violence as a way of life.  If you don't want it insinuated in the slightest that your choice of politicians, support for laws, etc. do nothing to ease the violent crime rate in this country, you will not want to leave the unaccountability that Samenow prescribes.  If you want change, read these other books and see how there's a way to change society without letting criminals deny their part in making the choice to harm others.thens calls the process of \\"violentization\\", the way in which a child, born innocent, becomes a mugger, a brawler, a rapist, or a killer.

Like many publications of the Ligourians, it hammers hard against abortion and is very wishy washy when describing the Church's equally strong testimony against capital punishment.  I've rated it down primarily because it attempts to fob off its views as \\"official\\" Catholicism, failing in many instances to recognize the presence of more moderate and radical elements within the Church.  The glossary of church terminology is incomplete:  there is no entry for \\"liberation theology\\" though it does find space for \\"terrorism\\" and \\"morality of war\\".  I think this book is an example of the kind of close-minded thinking that is all too common among the ecclesiastical hierarchy here in America, the same people, you will recall, who were recently revealed spending a lot of time and energy covering up the illegal sexual actions of certain priests.  I do, however, recommend the book as a material source of information about the Church and the views of its most conservative members.  Even the moderate, liberal, or fallen away Catholic will find it an informative and enlightening guide to current developments in church politics and theology.	2002-04-30

I especially found Solomon's comparison between the medieval perception of depression as a sin (sloth) and our modern medical understandings to be highly enlightening and explanatory of the hostile attitudes a depressive must face. Solomon, the son of a drug company magnate, realizes he is lucky, too: he has had access to all the best medicine.

The text is detailed and covers the subject in depth.  Several articles at the beginning of the book discuss the various uses of these signs and symbols around the world.  The book's key failure, IMHO, is that the author uses an indexing system that is hard to follow.  For example, you will found various kinds of crosses scattered through many categories.  It is hard to understand exactly what led him to group which symbols where.  On a few occasions, you will find symbols grouped with signs that seemingly bear no relationship in either shape or meaning.

Rhodes writes a personal and intellectual biography (the two are inseparable anyways) of a man who grew up in a violent home but didn't end up in prison.  He carries his narrative of Athens' life and works past a mere recounting of the criminologist's experiences and writings by comparing Athens' findings with other classic studies of violence, often finding in what appear to be contradictory studies evidence of the truth that Athens uncovered by his unconventional approach of actually interviewing men and women who had committed violent acts.

There seem to be two Stephen Jay Goulds out there.  One is this fellow who is being lambasted by other evolutionary theorists because he is a popularist and &quot;unscientific&quot;.  The other is the author of this book, a positive iconoclast and champion of the method of scientific inquiry who treats nonscientists as thinking persons.  &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; is written for the layman without descending to the usual levels common on the Fox Channel.  Gould does not talk down to his readers:  when explaining a scientific discovery or his own theories, he takes pains to outline and define the necessary background.  The reader can follow his complex argument with ease.<br />The book is divided into three parts:  The first examines the discovery of the Burgess Shale.  Gould recounts the legend, promulgated by Mr. Burgess himself, about how the find was discovered; he then returns to Burgess's own notebooks to expose what really happened.  Here, the theme is Science vs. Science Myth.  Gould's aim in this book is to cut through the mythology which evolutionary theorists have constructed around themselves and present an accurate version of a scientific investigation.<br />The second part examines the fossils found in the Shale themselves.  Classificatory scientists, Gould observes, practice what he calls &quot;the shoehorn&quot;:  the insertion of species into pre-existing categories where they might not belong.  He reconstructs the fauna that swam around in the seas that once submerged the bed and draws the conclusion that Burgess and other scientists have ignored the probability that many of the species which they catalogued left no descendants and so do not belong to any class of creature now living on the earth.  The problem Gould argues is that scientists put the system of classification ahead of actual observation.  The phylogenetic tree becomes a sacred plant that none can alter or question.<br />The third part is perhaps most disturbing to the scientist and to the layman.  It is taken as a given by many that human beings represent the pinnacle of evolution.  He examines many possibilities in the spirit of Frank Capra's &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;.  Gould not only observes that the process of evolution is continuing with us as part of it, but also that we're lucky to be here.  Our present being is contingent on certain events having happened in the past.  Were we to start evolution all over again, there's a good chance that we would not evolve at all, that our world would have a different type of fauna populating it.<br />One of the most interesting literary ploys Gould uses is to quote the Bible, affirming that what is important in our investigations is not the structure of our knowledge as we have outlined it, but the Truth itself.  Scientists like Gould make theories and remain open to the possibility that new evidence will overturn their models entirely.  I think &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; is an excellent work for examining how Science sometimes misleads itself; and how it can transcend human narrowness by a frank reappraisal of &quot;established facts&quot;.

To be truthful, some of the illustrations are so poorly drawn that you cannot really make out what they are.  The text is easy to read and the topics covered numerous.  I would use this book with caution, however, checking Williams' interpretations against other, more recent sources.  For the record, I am giving this book a two because the only other reviewer to write about it gave it a five and that is far too high for it.  I think this should yield an average of three, which is about right for this book.	2000-11-26

He also includes many individuals who have achieved only the designation of &quot;Blessed&quot;.  Where the Penguin and Oxford Dictionaries focus on those saints of importance to residents of the British isles, Delaney consciously selects (from his larger work) those who he feels have something to teach us by their lives (which is, after all, the primary reason for recognizing them as saints).  He includes a few saints of the Orthodox tradition and some popular saints, too.  (He is careful to debunk the legend of &quot;Little Saint Hugh&quot;.)<br />Delaney's faults include articles which are often too short and incomplete.  The entry for St. Francis Solano, for example, fails to recount the story of the missionary's arrival in the New World (he, alone, of a party of Europeans remained with eighty African slaves on a sinking ship and helped them to safety).  He often becomes too dry and this undermines his purpose of providing us with lives that will inspire.  You should also know that this volume was last revised in 1983, which means that a small number of recent saints  are not included.<br />The strongest points in favor of Delaney are his appendices of patron saints and their symbols, which are the most complete of the three which I have mentioned in this article.  I would not say that if you could only have a single dictionary of saints that this should be the one: I would, instead, advise owning it along with the Penguin and Oxford Dictionaries of Saints, to help add to the picture of those who the Christian Church has chosen to revere.	2000-11-16

If the book has any weakness, it is that the list of patron saints is too brief and incomplete.  (Delaney's appendix is the best of the three, but his work has other faults.)  Attwater and daughter also do not treat us to discussions of saintly relics (one of the joys of Stone's excellent work).

It contains pictures to keep the graphically inclined happy.  The marginalia directing readers to related topics is helpful.  The longer articles giving more general descriptions are fun to read.  On the other hand, Tressider seems to try too hard to come up with universal meanings for the symbols he describes, pointing out the common elements while ignoring instances where a symbol may have radically different meaning.  His articles are often short and incomplete.  This is not as comprehensive a book as Chevalier's Dictionary of Symbolism (which I would recommend for the serious student of art and literature over this one), but many readers will find it's clean format and short explanations entertaining and attractive.

Chevalier is not afraid to give contradictory or contrasting meanings of icons.  (He is not a universalist, but a relativist.)  He is usually careful to identify the culture in which a particular meaning is given.  I keep this in easy reach on my bookshelf, reminding myself, however, that no dictionary on this subject can possibly cover all the meanings a symbol may have.  It is worth having around.	2000-10-23

I dare not reveal to you what leads to Morris screaming at God &quot;Leave me alone forever!&quot;,  but when you reach that sentence you will have passed through a truly  amazing examination of two people in adultery, based on love for one party  and on dessicated lust for the other.  You will see Miracles as they might  have happened in this century.  You will also witness the stubbornness of  some who have been their beneficiaries.<br />Though you may not believe in  God, (I am an agnostic) you can hardly resist taking the side of Faith  under Greene's guidance.  That is his genius:  whether he writes tragedy or  comedy, Greene's mastery of irony appears to draw you to great truths.  You  need not be a Catholic to appreciate the God who enters the lives of Morris  and Sarah.  Even when punishing the wicked, Greene's God loves and  possesses an irresistable sense of humor.<br />This is a book that I recommend  happily to anyone, if for no other reason than to get a sense of a witty,  sensible Catholicism that few outsiders understand.  Skip the film.  Read  the book.	2000-05-20

He breaks important ground by making a home for two types who have been lately rejected by the  mainstreams of Skepticism and Religion:  those who believe in God even  though they know that they cannot prove God's existence empirically; and  those who simply refuse to answer the question.<br />Shermer makes an  excellent case for an alternative form of Skepticism with this book, based  on the premise that if there is a God, He/She/It is of such a character as  to be beyond human knowing.  God, Shermer reminds us, is supposed to be  omniscient (all-knowing), omnipresent (present everywhere), and omni-potent  (all-powerful).  We human beings are none of these things:  so how can any  of us claim to be certain of this other beings existence or nonexistence?<br />It is a premise which will make those who want empircal proof for their  beliefs unhappy:  neither the Creationist or the Atheist will be satisfied  with Shermer's formula.  Yet, I think, that thinking people of spirit and  nonspirit will appreciate Shermer's liberating observations.  He is  consciously trying to create a world-view about religion for the coming  millenium and, I dare say, his is the most realistic and sensible that I  have seen so far.<br />From this beginning, Shermer goes on to discuss the  human creation of religion, an artifact which is separate from the question  of whether or not God exists.  Shermer contends that we humans are, by the  grace of natural selection, pattern-seeking animals.  Religion is an  attempt by us to make sense of the chaos and the uncertainty which is  always there.  He concludes his discussion by establishing his view as an  independent theory of religion, offering it to religious scholars and  others who are seeking a common-sense position about the way we  believe.<br />The concluding section, about the theory of Evolution and its  relationship to issues of modern faith, has been cited by some as  superfluous and out of keeping with the rest of the book.  I contend,  however, that it is a logical conclusion to Shermer's epistemology given  that nowhere has the conflict between the Godless and the God-inspired been  so evident as it has been in this debate.  Shermer pulls evolution and  Science as a whole out of the political void created by this conflict and  sets it where it rightly belongs:  as an objective, well-grounded  explanation of the fossil evidence which does not tell us a thing about  whether or not God exists.  This question, Shermer believes, cannot be  answered by we mere humans.  We are best served by realizing our  limitations, he concludes, and accepting empirical Truth as limited to what  we can find out with our own senses.<br />It was appropriate that this book  appeared in the first month of the year 2000.  It is a book to guide  epistemological debate in the next millenium.nship to issues of modern faith, has been cited by some as  superfluous and out of keeping with the rest of the book.

He then proceeds to  use these principles, first to explore the contradictions of the most  &quot;unlikeliest cult of all&quot; (the followers of Ayn Rand who claim to  be disciples of objective reason) and then to explain the evidence for the  Holocaust and Evolution.<br />Anyone who needs a tune-up on her or his  objectivism can stand reading this book.

He is perhaps best known as the friend of Ishi and, sometimes, for his concept of  &quot;culture&quot; as &quot;superorganic&quot;, but it is this work that I  feel is his most lasting contribution.<br />Though some of the information has  been corrected by subsequent researchers (checking Kroeber's work against  more recent publications is reasonable), the Handbook remains useful to  anyone who wants an overview or details about the numerous peoples who  inhabited the state before the coming of the Spanish in 1769.<br />Where  Kroeber is sketchiest is, of course, where the peoples had been  exterminated before his investigations began shortly after the turn of the  century.  His work on the Yokuts and the Mojave, on the other hand, is  extensive and helps us to understand some of the culture of their now  missing neighbors.  He has left no people unaccounted for.  Thanks to this  volume, interest in the California Indians has been stimulated for all time  and with that interest has come a desire to preserve.<br />All California  history lovers and anthropologists need this book on their shelves.	2000-05-17

You may not agree with Nathan Miller's choices of the ten worst presidents, but I believe you will find this a very readable  and intelligent critique of ten different men who have attempted to lead  the country.  Though I remain one of those who felt last year's whole  impeachment sideshow was a waste of precious tax dollars, I have to admit  that I had to agree with much of what Miller has to say about Clinton's  character.  (Our current president is not on the list, though Miller has  reserved the right to include him in future editions.)  He also makes  excellent cases against presidents who have been revered, such as Andrew  Johnson who faced impeachment in 1868 for his undermining of  Reconstruction.  Calvin Coolidge is pilloried for refusing to forgive the  debts of our Great War allies and, indirectly, contributing to the rise of  Adolf Hitler.  Some of the choices are predictable (such as Richard Nixon),  but others like Jimmy Carter may (or may not) surprise you.  Miller doesn't  pick on people for party or ideology:  he seeks instead to define for each  man what exactly it was that made him so bad for the country.  Those who  are picking our nation's leaders this year should review this book before  selecting from the candidates.	2000-03-02

A glance over the contents quickly revealed  several ludicrous errors that should never have passed the proofreader, if  indeed there was one.  (For example, at one point it claims that Andrew  Jackson was the first president to be elected after being defeated for the  office.  In the very next sentence it mentions Thomas Jefferson as one of  the other men who share this honor!  There are other laughable errors,  too.)  Had the authors and their editor (was there one) concentrated more  on content control than on fancy typography and tedious Clinton-bashing,  this book might have been a worthy addition to the bathroom reading shelf.	2000-03-02

(The Alcatraz article, for example, contains numerous  erroneous claims about the Rock.)<br />Her research into the claims of various  spiritualists is often incomplete:  she claims, for example, that D.D. Home  was never found to be cheating even though contemporary stage magicians  often reproduced his effects.  She also says that Home levitated in the  presence of eyewitnesses, neglecting to mention that these witnesses were  blindfolded or sitting in darkened rooms.<br />I do find Guiley useful for her  recounting of various other ghost legends (the section on the Bell Witch,  for example, contains three complete legends about the haunting).  But it  falls short of a great reference work.  Any good reference on ghosts and  spirits needs more biographical information about those who have debunked  spirits, more counter-checking of facts, and more willingness to disappoint  the ghost groupies.  Despite her efforts to appear more balanced, it is  obvious that Guiley writes for the money and doesn't dare to challenge what  has become, in publishing, a major source of revenue.	2000-01-07

Notable are the extended articles for major religions ranging from African religions to Taoism.  The  text is richly illustrated.<br />It makes, however, the mistake of defining  religions by their official doctrine only.  Though there are numerous  photos of people worshipping, some of the articles take only the work of  theologians seriously.  Living institutions are often treated as mere  relics of the past rather than as contemporary expressions of belief.<br />I  was also disappointed by the section on Mythology, which only treats dead  religions and these not very well, preferring to discuss the way Myth is  studied rather than providing specific details and cross-references.  Where  it covers these old traditions in depth, (and only the ones which are  prominent in Western intellectual thought, alas!) it fails to flesh out the  tales of the gods and goddesses or to provide a handy reference to  different pantheons.<br />It often fails on the side of  &quot;neutrality&quot; by failing to present skeptical perspectives on  religion.  (There isn't even an article on Skepticism, which is, in this  century, as important a movement as Iconoclasm was in the 8th and 9th  centuries).  Secular humanism also receives short shrift.<br />The owner of  this volume who bears these failures in mind will nonetheless find it  useful.  There's a fascinating section on New Religions, an extensive  bibliography, and many fine, brief articles on the many facets of religion.  It is worth having this among your general reference books.	2000-01-01

Collectors of Dr. Seuss books will definitely want this volume.  I found it eerie to see creatures which later appeared in books like ~Horton Hears a Who~, ~How the Grinch Stole Christmas~, and other favorite books of my  childhood turning up in caricatures of Axis powers, racists, war  profiteers, and the Fifth Column.  But, upon reflection, I must admit that  these cartoons mark the origins of the themes of community awareness and  social consciousness that distinguish his comedic later works.  I would not  call this a book to be had on every shelf, but if you grew up with Dr.  Seuss and still sneak peeks at those slender volumes up in your attic (or  in the clutches of your own children and grandchildren), you will find  yourself fascinated by the obvious comparisons.<br />The book includes  explanatory commentary by Richard H.

Unlike the books written by the credible, Randi provides many valuable  accounts of how famous seers and magicians have hoodwinked the public.<br />Randi's research is sometimes flawed and his accounts sketchy, which  leads me to reduce the rating I give for this book.  For example, he does  not realize that the Necronomicon was a Twentieth Century invention of  horror author H.P. Lovecraft and he falsely implicates Increase Mather as a  proponent of the Salem Witchcraft trials.  (Increase was off in England  when the whole thing started and was shocked to find it underway upon his  return.)  He is also coy about revealing details of certain trade secrets  used by stage magicians and bunko spiritualists.  These flaws detract from  an otherwise marvellous and valuable reference.	1999-12-09

His is a strong case for  historical accuracy against a very old call for political correctness  masking as &quot;tradition&quot; and against the coveting of profitable  fame at the expense of the truth.<br />One of the concluding essays in the  book discusses the author's top ten candidates for &quot;toppling&quot;.  It is Loewen's hope that you will read the markers in your community more  carefully and, perhaps, do something to make sure that the facts are  properly recorded for future generations.	1999-12-05
