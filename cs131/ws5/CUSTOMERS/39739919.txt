Professors Cecilia Saccone and Graziano Pesole have not only provided us with a treasure trove of molecular, structural and compositional information, but more importantly, they have produced a scholarly exegesis of empirical, statistical, bioinformatical, computational, and evolutionary methodology. The Handbook contains both introductory and advanced material, and manages to maintain a degree of lucidity that is as rare as it is indispensable in scientific discourse.&quot;  (Dan Graur, Ph.D., Gordon Professor of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University)	2003-03-05
