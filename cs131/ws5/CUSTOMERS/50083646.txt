A few days ago I read and watched Silence of the Lambs for the first time ever and fell in love with both the book and the movie right off. So of course I just had to read the sequel to that wonderful book. It's strange; the man who wrote one of the best books I have ever read has also written one of the worst books I have ever read in my entire life. I absolutely loathed this book. The plot is ludicrous and absurd, the writing is sloppy and demented (why the heck does Harris change tenses with every freakin' paragraph?), new characters are bizarre and unpleasant, there is far too much gore, and worst of all, old characters from SOTL are transformed into flat caricatures of their previous selves.    One example of this is Harris's treatment of Hannibal Lecter in this novel. What happened to the evil, mocking, sarcastic, dangerous Lecter of SOTL? What happened to the Dr.Lecter who was so evil and so dangerous that he had to be kept in tons of restraints when he wasn't caged up? The Dr.Lecter who, when security was relaxed just a tiny bit at the asylum, attacked and mauled a nurses' face? The Dr. Lecter who gleefully tormented a grieving mother? What happened to the coolest, scariest villain in all literature and filmdom? Dr. Lecter is too busy shopping in this novel to do anything scary. In this novel Harris has decided that Dr.Lecter, instead of being a villain, is actually an ANTI-HERO. He's evil because of a CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. If Harris absolutely had to give a reason for Lecter's madness then it at least should have been something more original and interesting. Oh, and in this novel Lecter only kills people who are worse than he is or who have bad taste. Dr.Lecter is a fascinating villain but why the heck does Harris think we want to sympathize with him? Fascinating or not, Lecter's still an insane monster. And the whole Mischa thing is just stupid. In SOTL Lecter would have eaten Mischa for breakfast.    Not being content with only ruining Dr. Lecter's character,Harris also has to stomp Clarice Starling into the dirt. SPOILER ALERT: The coolest heroine in all of literature is turned into a passive cannibalistic consort at the end of this novel. I almost screamed when I read what Harris had done to Clarice. The Clarice in SOTL would never in a million years have done what she does in this book. Absolutely disgusting. I think Harris has been reading too many Anne Rice novels. There is not one redeeming feature in this novel. Mason Verger is a horrible villain, he's like a parody of a lame cartoon villain. His elaborate scheme with the pigs is unintentionally hilarious and absurd. Honestly I can't believe that someone who wrote such an intelligent, thrilling, haunting book like SOTL could come up with this mess. I do not recommend this book to anyone who likes SOTL. It is a very disappointing sequel.	2004-08-28

If it inspires teenage girls to get to know Jesus then that's great. I just hope that once they are serious about Jesus then they will pick up a copy of a different bible. Preferably one that doesn't have glossy pictures of skinny, glamorous models in it. Revolve does have some good advice in it, (the info about different charities is great) but I'm a bit concerned by its negative attitude towards teens. Are teens so shallow that they can't read holy scripture without glossy pretty pictures and like, totally cool quizzes? The Christian teens that I know are certainly more serous about their faith than this. They don't need a pretty exterior to get them interested in Christ and the bible. Like I said, some of the advice is good but other advice doesn't have much to do with the bible. Advice like, \\"Revolve girls don't chew with their mouths open\\" And that has what to do with the bible??? Sorry, I must have missed Jesus' sermon on table manners.	2004-04-12

Ill Met By Moonlight is an enchanting blending of fairylore, history, fantasy, the ballad Tam Lin and Shakespearean themes. It is chock full of quotes from Shakespeare and I love how cleverly Hoyt fits them in with the action of her tale. In Ill Met By Moonlight Hoyt daringly uses William Shakespeare as her main character. Shakespeare's wife and daughter have been stolen by the \\"good people\\" and with the help of a gender changing elf named Quicksilver, Shakespeare has to save them ala Tam Lin. The Hamlet like Quicksilver must also bring about the downfall of his traitorous brother who has stolen his throne from him. This is a wonderfully original story full of engaging, sympathetic characters, an exciting, compelling plot and a good dash of humor and sex. It's a fantastic first novel and I am eagerly awaiting the sequel.	2002-09-08

This sounded like it was going to be a really good, informative book but it was just so silly and unrealistic that it grew dull fast. Like most extremists Ms.Coulter is only able to see things in black and white. You are either an evil conniving unpatriotic liberal or you are a noble and patriotic conservative. Basically the Saturday morning cartoon way of thinking. I enjoy well written and thought out books about both parties. This wasn't that kind of book. There are just too many lies and inconsistencies, it's basically one long diatribe. Very very dull.	2002-06-27

I think everyone makes a mistake though of saying it's just a guys book. I'm a woman, and it was my mother who recommended Princess to me! I think any girl who's interested in science fiction or fantasy would really enjoy this book. Yeah, it was obviously written with adolescent boys in mind but I think anyone can enjoy this wildly imaginative page turner.<br />The characters are all extremely likable. John Carter is the perfect southern gentleman. Honorable, loyal, incredibly brave, respectful to women, extremely handsome; a perfect hero who is never boorish or conceited. Then there's Sola, one of the few green Martians to show compassion and kindness, and Tars Tarkas(aren't these names so cool?)a ferocious green martian warrior with a tragic past who is also able to feel compassion and love. And I dare anybody to tell me that they wouldn't want a Woola of their very own! Dejah Thoris though is mainly for the guys. Carter's love and devotion for her was really sweet. I didn't even know that this was part of a book series until I read it on amazon and now I am really eager to read the other books of the series. And wasn't the end cool? I don't think I've ever read an ending quite like that before. What Carter found in the cave at the end was very creepy and intriguing. (I won't give out a spoiler)<br />Although this is pulp fiction and sort of like a comic book in a way,(I can see mothers in 1912 scolding their kids, \\"That Edgar Rice Burroughs is going to rot your mind if you keep reading it!\\") it's still light science fiction at it's best! (I'll warn you right off though, please don't expect something deep and complex like Dune or Darkover and post a review whining about it. Princess is purely for fun.) And am I the only one that thinks Princess would make a really awesome movie?	2002-05-13

The plot sounded like it would be really good, the experiences of a young girl growing up in the south during the civil war, but the execution left much to be desired. For one thing, Evvy thinks and acts more like a very liberal, very politically correct modern feminist than she does a girl living in the south during the 1860s. I like heroines to be strong and independant, but you've got to be realistic when you're dealing with historical fiction. Evvy was so liberal that I kept expecting her to start defending gay rights and abortion. Brenaman could have wrote about a young girl's disatisfaction with the treatment of women during that time period and still made her character a realistic girl of that period. Ann Rinaldi does this to perfection. Instead Evvy comes off as just being a modern girl in 18th century costume.<br />This is also one of those historical fiction books where all of the bad guys have the prejudices and beliefs of that time period while all the good guys have  modern PC beliefs. A very simplistic way of looking at history. I also had a hard time believing that Evvy's Quaker cousins would be quite so blase about premaritial sex and adultery. Because all of the characters acted in such modern ways, I didn't get a good feel for the time period in this book. It didn't make me feel as if I was seeing a slice of the past. The book wasn't very well written also or thought out clearly. And even though it's called Evvy's Civil War hardly any of it is set during the war itself. And I won't even get into that horrible baby switching scene! Evvy's War is light and amusing but that's about all it is. If you want to read a good YA historical novel about the civil war then try something by Ann Rinaldi instead.	2002-05-02

It's one the most imaginative and original books I've ever read and I'm surprised that it's out of print, especially with interest in children's fantasy at an all time high. It's as good as Harry Potter, if not better! It has everything you'd want in a book. Wicked governesses, pirates, witches, wizards, highway men, talking animals, king arthur, lost treasure. It's an exciting, wonderful, magical book which I totally recommend to all those out there looking for some good, original fantasy. It's a children's book but grownups will love it too. Unfortuntly The Midnight Folk isn't in print in the United States, but I ordered my copy from amazon.co.uk for a pretty cheap price, which is what I recommend anyone who wants a copy of it to do. There's also an equally wonderful sequel called The Box of Delights: When the Wolves Were Running, which I also recommend and which you an also obtain from amazon.co.uk.	2001-12-20

How come books like these always assume that everyone lives in an extremely wealthy republican household, with plenty of money so the wife can just quit her job? I wouldn't mind being a stay at home mom, but thats never going to happen. Not in a million years. You see, I live in the REAL WORLD. Out in the real world it takes two salaries to survive. Out in the real world most wives have to work, its not because they have this &quot;power trip&quot; its so they can actually buy their kids enough food and clothes and get them through collage. My mother worked, her mother worked, and I'm sure my great grandmother worked too. And thats because we are part of a class that this book ignores, the &quot;untouchables&quot; aka working class. If you look throughout history, its only been the middle class wives who got the pleasure of staying at home and taking care of the kids. Everyone else was either doing factory work or farm work. But of course Ms. Graglia ignores this basic fact, preferring to see through rose tinted sun glasses at a world where everyone is rich and can survive on one little salary. And no, I'm not a raving feminist, I'm just a realist.<br />I would like to mention though that I find baking cakes, changing diapers, and house keeping about as interesting as a pyschic's lecture...	2001-10-28

I've just discovered the Angelique series(reading Angelique in Barbery just this minute) and I cannot believe such a brilliant series is out of print in the USA! Angelique:The Marquise of Angels is the first book of this series, and is about the childhood and first marriage of one of literatures greatest heroines, Angelique. The copy I read was actually an old library copy of it, and it was titled Angelique and combined this book and Road to Versailles as one. The Angelique books are excellent historical fiction and both Golons(Anne and Serge) were born storytellers. The Marquise of Angels is my favorite book of the series so far. Its really brought to life a time period I knew very little about, 1600s France. This book has everything. Intrigue,suspense,romance,action,wonderful historical detail,great and memorable characters, the works. I also love how Golon brings to life historical figures. Theres so many memorable scenes in just this one book, my favorite scene is probably Angelique and the poison(I won't give it away!) Like another reviewer has said, it is definitly a very cool scene. I just can't understand why these books are out of print, they are quality fiction! Theres 63 reviews for this book on Amazon, alot of books that are in print don't get that many! And all of them are positive five star reviews too! I know they did put the first 2 books in print again a few years ago, as special large print editions but alot of people(myself included) don't like large print. If only they would put the whole series out again(regular print) and get the last three books translated, I'd be a happy camper...	2001-07-27

In this version Robin Hood isn't such a perfect, superior guy. He was a bit overly cautious and insecure. It was ironic how McKinley made Robin the worst archer of the  group, I don't think any other author would have dared to do that, it is  what Robin is famed for after all. I also liked how the bad side of the  outlaw life was shown, like not having enough food and the paranoia about  being caught. I loved the character of Marion and wished that there would  have been more about her life, maybe McKinley could write a sequel starring  Marion? I didn't care much for the ending though. I would rather they had  been pardoned and allowed to live in England. Also, Richard the Lionheart  wasn't that great of a guy, he killed almost a million muslims once because  they wouldn't convert to christianity. Thankfully, McKinley doesn't turn  him into a saintly, better-than-thou character, we are left rather unsure  on how to feel about Richard. I also liked the romance between Cecil/Cecily  and Little John and the mystery surrounding Cecil when he first joins the  outlaws. My only complaint would be that it was much too short and a lot  was left out from the legends. I like Beauty and Hero and the Crown better  but The Outlaws of Sherwood is a great book too. I recommend it to anyone  in search of a good read, be they adult or children. One other thing:Why is  McKinleys books considered children books? They seem to be better written  and more complex than a lot of adult books I could name. I suppose because  there is no graphic sex or swearing(thank god)	2000-05-15

The only other two completely perfect books I can think of are The Last Unicorn and Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. Beauty and the Beast has always been my favorite fairy tale. I read Rose Daughter first and thought that it  was a lovely book, magical and delicatly written. When I found out that she  had written another book about Beauty and the Beast I couldn't wait to read  it. Beauty is much superior to Rose Daughter, the character of Beauty in  Rose Daughter is very quiet, pallid, and the tiniest bit dull. The  character of Beauty in Beauty however is wonderful, an awkward, boyish  teenager who values her intellegence more than her looks and who also loves  horses. The relationship between Beauty and the Beast is better written in  Beauty than Rose Daughter, The Beast in Rose Daughter wasn't too  interesting and was a bit too mild and limpid but I could feel real  sympathy for the beast in Beauty and he also had a stronger personality. I  also liked the ending of Beauty much better, I was so glad that he turned  into a handsome prince! In Rose Daughter he stayed a beast and that was  kind of a let down. This was a wonderful book, I couldn't put it down and  felt sad when it ended. Like all of Robin McKinleys books it is beautifully  written and imaginative. My goal has now become to buy and read all of her  books.	2000-05-15

Its good to find collections of their tales out there that are not just watered down versions. Jack Zipes, who has also translated wonderful editions of the  thousand and one nights and a collection of French Fairy Tales(both highly  recommended) does an excellent job with the Grimms and provides interesting  commentary about the orgins of the tales. My favorite story in particalar  was one about a tailor, I can't remember the name.(Yes, I know there are a  million stories about tailors but this was the one where the tailor gets  blinded and his traveling companion treats him horribly) This edition even  includes all of the stories that were even too violent for the Grimm  Brothers. One called &quot;How Some Children Played at Slaughtering&quot;  is especially unappetizing. All in all I recommend this book to anyone who  would like a little enchantment in their lives.

If you are a fan of Lewis  Carroll then this is the book for you. Gorgous illustrations and  photographs, an interesting and informative text, this is a wonderful  little book to own. It is also informative if you are interested in  Victorian England such as Iam (probably due to my Lewis Carroll fixation)  There are also examples of Lewis Carrolls photography and pictures of the  Liddle children.

It was a very engaging book but more like a collection of short  stories than a novel. The two unrelated stories didn't bother me too much,  my favorite story out of the whole bunch was the one about the woman and  the breast cancer although I thought it was kind of selfish of her to leave  him after he had stuck by her. This was a very interesting book but maybe  not as meaningful as it tried to be and not as much fun as Bridget Jones.  Still, the stories are worth a read and I recommend this book to anyone  with time on their hands. Just don't expect Bridget Jones.I did like the  main character Jane though. She was much more realistic than Bridget and I  liked her sense of humour.I just didn't find her to be terribly  interesting. The first story was probably the best.

Coming from a poor  area like Appalachia when I was young in the 50s I don't remember being too  well looked after by my men. My mother was beat every night by my father  and then he left her  when I was 14 and we both had to go out and get jobs.  Of course one of the problems back then was that it was so hard for women  to find good jobs and we just weren't educated for it. We had to work as  waitresses and that was about all we could do until we got married and then  when our husbands got layed off we had to find work again and I had to work  in a pencil factory while I was married anyway even when my husband wasnt  layed off, my husband wasn't making enough money for the both of us and all  our kids. So see, we weren't all rich little house wives back then and the  author herself doesn't say much about the poor. I will tell you this  though, if there weren't books like this around my daughter wouldn't be a  doctor today and having a secure future. Shed be working at some dead end  job like I was waiting for a guy to marry her and then probably still  having to keep a job to keep the kids clothed. I'm tired of anti feminist  rich republican wives putting down the feminist movement. It helped my life  and that is all I can say about it.	2000-04-18

This story blew my mind, it was so imaginative and  exciting and written so beautifully and I looked everywhere for some of his  books and couldn't find them. Luckily, Del Ray has put them back into  print. The King of Elflands Daughter is a wonderful novel, very beautiful  and dreamy. Lord Dunsany had a large imagination and it shows. His writing  is like reading poetry and his descriptions are very vivid. I loved the way  Elfland was described, I recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy  and is sick of pale Tolkein imitations.	2000-04-01

Yeah, I know Ulysses was chosen as number 1 but those guys who picked the best books of the 20th century don't know what  their missing. This book has everything, you will fall in love with Franci  Nolan and her family. Its realistic about poverty but not quite as  depressingly repetitive as Angela's Ashes(I liked AA but A Tree Grows in  brooklyn is much better) This is one of those books where you escape into  the world of the characters and become best friends with the main  character. I could read this book over and over again and not get bored,  its a remarkable book and I recommend it to everyone who would like to be  introduced to a wonderful book that they can  treasure forever.	2000-04-01
US	50083646	R35T9VKXXWT4E9	0441005837	937207660	Rose Daughter	Books	4	16	17	N	N	Rose Daughter	I have never read Beauty before (although I would love to) so I can't compare the two but I have  to say that Rose Daughter is one of the most magical and beautiful books that I've ever come across. It is very dreamy  and full of enchantment. I loved the fact that Beauty and her sisters were  close in this book and I don't think it was at all overly sweet as one  reviewer has said. The characters of the sisters were wonderful and I liked  Beauty's character too, very quiet and practical yet not too  much of a  goody two shoes. My only complaint (and the reason I'm only giving four  stars) would be that McKinley gives us a great atmosphere of suspense and  mystery and yet the end is rather hurried and weak. I was really getting  interested in the mystery of the palace and the beast and yet all the of  mystery is explained by the greenwitch in a very undramatic way. It seemed  the great buildup fizzled out. I was hoping for some great confrontation  between the evil sorcerer and beauty and the beast yet nothing really  happened and everything was not fully explained. I was also hoping for the  transformation of the beast to a handsome young man but I can kind of see  why McKinley's ending is just as good as the original fairy tale ending.  You normally don't want the person you've fallen in love with to turn into  somebody else, do you? Anyway, besides the weak ending I still think this a  very good book and I can't wait to read Beauty because it is suppose to be  even better.	2000-04-01

There was just too much hatred and bloodshed for me to really enjoy it but I can understand why she made it bloody, it wasn't  really a very happy time to be living in, with everyone so ambitious for  the crown, and the name of the book is Funearal Games after all. It was  still a very interesting book altough the violence did get kind of  repetitive. I recommend it to anyone who has read the previous two books  but if you haven't then you should read them first, especially The Persian  Boy.	2000-04-01
US	50083646	RR8I0PVWHSCOT	0345373707	183408691	Cry to Heaven	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Cry to Heaven	This is a very good book, it actually got me interested in opera! Iwas flipping through the channels the other day and suddenly came on to The Marriage of Figaro on PBS. Being bored and remembering Cry to Heaven I decided to listen to some of it and while I was watching it I kept thinking of Tonio and all of his voice excercises and how beautifully Anne described the music and I was really enjoying listening to it and this from someone whose usual musical perference is The Smashing Pumpkins and Tori Amos!  Anyway, back to the book. Its a great book and really wonderfully written and I think I may like it better than her vampire books (Feast of all Saints is probably my favorite book,or at least the one that kept me the most hooked while reading it) I was wondering though about the eunechs, were they really as supernaturally beautiful as she made them out to be?  They all seemed to be super tall and she said they had strange skin. The only complaint I would have against this book would be that while the beginning and the end are very fast paced and interesting the middle sort of drags and there is too much talk about Tonios relationships with other people. I also didn't like the way that he just seemed to drop Guido for &quot;real men&quot; like the cardinal. And Christina was not needed at all, she was boring and I hated every scene with her and Tonio's love for her didn't seem very realistic, not like his love for Guido or the cardinal. I got so sick of reading about her &quot;little darling wrists&quot; or her &quot;little nose.&quot; She could have been such an interesting and complex character (a woman painter from that period, a rebel against society) but she came off as flat and boring and I can't believe such a dull person could have been such a glorious painter. Besides that it is a really good book and I fully recommend it. even if you don't like her vampire books you will like Cry to Heaven.	2000-04-01

Very funny in parts, I would love to see the movie and compare the two. Maybe a bit too brief(I wish it would at least have been about 200  pages longer)but still a great book and one of my favorites.	2000-04-01

They always love classical music and have a deep appreciation for Renaissance Art. What  about a vampire who likes rap and hip hop and whose favorite artist is Andy  Warhol. What about a vampire with bad taste? Hey, what about a vampire who  watches Tom Green and whose favorite movie is Dumb and Dumber? And why are  they always gay or bi? I have nothing against gay people but what about a  straight vampire for once. Surely there must be some straight people made  into vampires! I was also wondering why all of her male characters are so  much more sympathetic and nice than her female characters. There wasn't one  nice female character in The Queen of the Damned. For some reason her  female characters are always kind of cold and distant while her male  characters are always very feeling, always weeping and stuff like that. And  why does she always use the word weep instead of cry? Iam going to weep  says Lestat. Anyway its a good book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys  vampires and other things that go bump in the night.<br />PS What about a  plain and not too good looking vampire? Even when their suppose to be 70  yrs old they still somehow keep their looks like  David Talbot. How about  Ernie, the 40 yr old redneck vampire with the buck teeth, beer belly and  thinning hair,  whose favorite type of music is Elvis and Hank Williams and  whose idols are Steve Austin and John Wayne.	2000-03-27

In The Tombs of Atuan Tenar frees herself from the superstition, hatred and darkness of her religon in order to find freedom and truth. Ged  helps her to make this journey from darkness to light. The reviewer who  said that it was a dark and brooding book is right  but afterwards when Ged  and Tenar escape from the tombs there is a feeling of hope and freedom.  This is a great book and I fully recommend it.	2000-03-10

I loved Fire From Heaven but The Persian Boy is even better. It is a very compelling book by a master storyteller. I didn't know much about Greek,Macedonian,or Persian  culture before I read these books but Mary Renault makes you feel as if you  are an eyewitness at Alexanders conquests. I loved the character of Bagoas  and was surprised to find that he was a real person. I fully recommend this  book to anyone who loves great books. It is thrilling, beautiful,  heartbreaking, and just plain wonderful.	2000-03-10

Iam 18 years old and it is still one of my favorite books. The Prydain Chronicles show a deph and sensitivity that a lot of fantasy for  adults does not have. The characters are also wonderful. Like many other  people who reviewed this book I was also disappointed with the cartoon  which seemed to take out all the deph and to make the characters more cute  and cuddely than they were in the book. The Black Cauldron is a great book  and I fully recommend it to one and all.	2000-03-10

Even if you don't like historical fiction (I love it) then you will still be drawn into the plot and come to love the characters. Mary Renaults writing style is very engaging and beautiful. If you are in a bad  mood and feeling depressed just read the first chapter of Fire From Heaven  and you will be drawn into another world and find that your troubles have  been forgotton. It is very engrossing and exciting and I recommend it to  anyone and everyone who loves to read.	2000-03-05

When I was taking it out of the library the librarian told me that she had never known anyone to check it  out before. This should have told me something right off. Eagerly I turned  to the first page and was hit with &quot;riverrun, past Eve and Adam's from  swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of  recirculation back to Howth Castle...&quot; Then I came on to  &quot;bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk!&quot;  I quickly scanned the rest of the book &quot;Surely it can't go on like  this for the whole thing!&quot; I thought in despair. It did. I tried to  read two pages of it then gave up in disgust. &quot;Whats the use of  reading it? It doesn't make any sense or mean anything at all.&quot; It was  like I was just reading a string of words that had nothing to do with each  other, I saw no use to waste my time with it. I'm not saying that just  because I couldn't read it doesn't mean its not readable. I'm sure a lot of  intellctuals have (fun?) reading it and also have fun telling other people  they are stupid oprah reading TV obssessed coach  potatos if they don't  like it also. Some of these reviews have shown the people that like this  book to be in this frame of mind. Anyway, if you like it then fine, but I  can't see the point in trying to decode it, it wasn't like Joyce was the  messenger of god, why should decoding nonsense passages like the above be  so important?	2000-03-05

His sentence structure is very different from anything I've ever  read before  and his writing style is very dense(somebody once told me that  it was like swimming through mayonaise) He is one of most original writers  of this century and certainly one of the most poetic. Reading Swanns Way  has made me hungry to read more of Proust. I've looked everywhere for the  whole set of In Search of Lost Time(or Rememberence of Things Past) luckily  Amazon has the whole set. Everybody should at least try to read Swanns Way.	2000-02-09

I agree with the reviewer who said that it was as if Dickens had a million jokes that he wanted to get off of his chest. And such wonderful  characters! The last part of the book though is more about  Mr. Pickwick  himself than about the club. He also becomes less of a doofus and more of a  lovealbe and sympathetic character as the novel progresses. If you are ever  down and feeling depressed then this is the book to read.Sam Weller is one  of Dickens greatest characters, the book really comes into its own when he  becomes Mr.Pickwicks servent.	2000-02-09

David Copperfields life paraells that of Dickens,they both had to work as children, both made bad marriages to very pretty yet very silly and flighty women, ect,ect. David  is also rather like Pip in Great Expectations, both novels are about  learning from your mistakes and growing up. David matures enough at the end  to realize that he wants a grownup marriage, not a silly childesh one such  as he had with Dora when his eyes triumphed over his mind and heart, but  now he wants a person who he can grow old with and so he realizes Agnes is  the one he should have married all along. The characters are wonderful,  probaly the greatest collection of characters from any of Dickens books. I  would count David Copperfield as being Dicken's greatest triump, a  masterful plot, wonderful characters, great storytelling, make this his  most perfect novel.<br />I was relieved to read in the end that Mr.Mell was  doing alright in Australia, Steerforths nasty treatment of him made me hate  Steerforth for the rest of the novel and not too sorry about his death.	2000-02-09

The debates about progress and religon were very  enlightening, as also were Mann's theories about time and space. You must  read this book two times though to really get the full benefit of it, I've  only read it once but I plan to read it again in the near future.	2000-02-09
