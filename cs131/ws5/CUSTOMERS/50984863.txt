It's got a bitter divorce, a Betty Broderick-type mom ripping the husband to the kids, an affair, alcoholism, poisoning, and a couple of murders.  It's a thick book, but it's so hard to put down, it's a fast read.  Totally worth every penny.  Thanks again, Ms. Rule!	2005-03-04

In this book, Jaine writes a sitcom script and works on the studio lot with best pal, Kandi, while it's being produced.  Of course someone is killed.  Kandi is blamed, and Jaine tries to clear Kandi so goes a-sleuthing.  Just as entertaining as the first book, Ms. Levine gives us laugh-out-loud fun.  She is GOOD.	2005-03-04

Actually not really a man - some sort of angel or spirit or something.  It's not clear what he's there for - to make sure Stephanie has a merry Christmas probably.  His 'mission' should have been made known to the reader earlier, and it might have made the book more enjoyable.  Still, we are dealing with a guy from the Great Beyond or something - a far cry from the realism the Plum novels are made of.  One of the people she is trying to capture as a bondsman is a guy named Sandy Claws, who runs a toy factory staffed by \\"elves\\", who are these mean \\"little people\\".  Hilarious stuff there, and the book is filled with the usual wonderful Evanovich sense of humor.  The Plum family is in the book (thank goodness - sometimes they are my favorite part).  And good old Lula is there, with a dash or two of Morelli thrown in.  Except for the Sci-Fi Guy, it's another Plum winner.	2005-01-23

Ryan, called \\"A Gilded Age Mystery\\".  The story takes place in 1868 Boston, which makes it immediately interesting.  Main character, Nell Sweeney, is a governess to a rich family.  When parents of a missing girl come to the mistress of the house for help in finding her, Nell takes on the task.  Characters are good and well-rounded.  The character of Nell strikes me as a bit far-fetched when she fights off a bad guy.  She's supposed to be this gorgeous lady, and how she overpowers him is frankly not believable.  The book lacks humor but is otherwise well written.  The author refers back to the first book in the series a lot, but I see no advantage in having to read Number One first.  Good climax at the end.	2005-01-23

But advertised as a \\"Queen-Size Manhattan PI\\", which is why I bought the book thinking 'here's something different', there wasn't much reference to her being fat.  The author could have done a lot more with that angle and should have since that is the series' signature mark.  Still, the plot was fine; characters pretty good; and it was a fairly fast read. It was easy to keep track of what was happening.  I found the writing to be charming, with a good sense of humor.  I'll read another.	2004-11-21

Written by youngest Lindbergh sibling, Reeve, she tells of living on her own farm in Vermont, with a smaller house on the property her mother lived in during that time.  Reeve Lindbergh is a wonderful writer - she doesn't need the famous last name to prove that.  When she isn't writing about her mother, which is riveting for some reason, her writing of anything else in the book has such a fresh, emotional spirit behind her words.  Anne Morrow Lindbergh, a legend in her own time both in flying, her husband,  and her many published works, did not talk much in her last years.  It is a story of how the family felt and coped with her condition, letting go of the vibrant mother they once knew.  An excellent book for those who have been a caregiver to a parent or sibling.  Anne M.L. was such a famous figure, it was both interesting and heartwrenching to have the privilege of reading about her day to day living. Thank you, Reeve Lindbergh, for sharing this story that you could have kept to yourself, but chose to share.  It's a book that will be remembered long after it's read.	2004-10-17

The sisters were raised in high society, two are widowed (there's three), and it makes for a different kind of cast.  The book is well written, and the plot easy enough to where it's an enjoyable page turner.  In this premiere novel, a wealthy newspaper publisher is murdered and Nora, who was hired by him to write part of the society page, is sure one of the wealthy suspects didn't do it.  When her sisters get strangely involved, she is thrust into the mystery.  Quite a climactic scene that's both exciting and surprising.	2004-10-11

We get a good dose of family, romance with Joe? or Ranger?, and Ms. Evanovich's trademark humor.  In this book, Stephanie steps into gang territory and there's a contract out on her.  A fast-paced page turner, with out loud laughs probably on every page (I didn't count - I just enjoyed), Plum fans will not be let down.  Though the climax at the end is a little short, it's easily overlooked with all the prime entertainment the novel gives us all the way through.  Even the hardcover price is worth shelling out for.

Cohen's 'Bad Hair Day' mystery series is better than the first ('Permed to Death').  Ms. Cohen writes well, as she did in the first.  But this one has a more interesting plot.  Marla Shore, hair salon owner/main character, is working on a committee to put together a fund raiser, featuring the best chefs around, to save some oceanfront land. I still don't feel there is enough substance to Marla's character.  And most attempts at humor fell flat, but the author scored in two or three places, which is better than her batting zero in humor with her first.  It doesn't help when someone is dumping medical waste in the preservation area, committing a murder or two, and going after Marla with everything from bullets to coconuts.  Good romance reading between Marla and the detective who doesn't want her involved in solving crimes.  Its well-done and surprising climactic scenes make this a worthwhile read.	2004-09-12

The suspects are all staying at a B & B, and since there are three couples involved it can get a little confusing, but Ms. Myers is good at differentiating between her interesting characters.  Some laughs are there, but not as plentiful as in her \\"Penn/Dutch\\" series books.  The main character, Abby, seems to be lacking something to flesh her out all the way.  She's not really likeable, and she is not disliked, but on the blah side. She's a short (4 foot-something) lady.  Okay, we got it Ms. Myers. It'd be nice to have more to go on.   Her fight with her husband in this book seemed based on little and does not warrant reader sympathy for either of them.  It only sounds like she's dumb for walking out on the great-looking husband he is supposed to be. The supporting cast of regular characters surpass Abby in charm and general characterization.  Still a very good read and not to be missed.	2004-08-27

This spurs Marla on to find the real killer.  Though the book was well written and good, the title and cover may mislead readers into thinking the story is full of laughs, and it's not.  If there were any attempts at humor, I missed them.  Marla is not a real interesting character.  She seems to just exist, and there is nothing to really like or dislike about her.  However, the author brings in other characters that have more of a personality (perhaps too many in this story).  Hopefully we will get to know Marla better in the second book.	2004-08-27

Jaine Austen is a freelance writer, writing brochures and resumes - whatever clients wish.  A nerd contacts her one day and wants her to write a hot blonde areobics instructor a letter asking her out on a date for him.  She does, and the blonde accepts!  But when the guy goes to pick her up, he finds her dead - or so he claims.  Jaine feels responsible for the whole mess, feeling her client could not have murdered anyone, so she begins to play detective to find out who the real killer is.  The plot is good, the characters are good, the climax is good.  It's a fast read because it's so entertaining.  Ms. Levine has an incredible sense of humor.  I think on the cover it says it's laugh-out-loud comedy.  Sure, I've read that before.  But this time it's really true.  Nearly every page is filled with fresh, on the mark, humor.

I loved it.  Magdalena, the owner of the inn, is in top form, as are all other characters.  The humor was on target, the plot fairly simple and suspense worked well when called for.  In this book, a guest at the inn named Colonel Custard checks in.  He is in Hernia (the town) because he plans to build a five-star hotel and make a tourist haven out of the quaint, Amish-Mennonite community.  Suspects abound, as no one wants him to ruin the town like that.  Custard recipes look great and are an extra bonus to this highly entertaining book. Magdalena admits she &quot;wails&quot; too much, which helps to validate all the other books that have her &quot;wail&quot;-ing too frequently.  One complaint, and that is how she solves this murder.  I think it was too far-fetched, even for Magdalena and even if she herself was the one to solve it, there was not enough evidence to convince me to take the suspect seriously.  It looked like, when her theory proved true, she just got lucky.<BR>But that tends to be a small thing when being entertained so with another winner from Ms. Myers.	2004-07-08

There is a wealth of information in those captions such as:  what year a structure was made, what year it was razed, what took its place, its location both old and new, etc.  It is an easy reference tool to historical Fall River, Massachusetts, in the sense that it would take a person poring over many other books to get all this information, if you even did then.  What I did not like about the book:  The author did not include a great variety of schools or churches, and had several on the same property.  Photos on Lizzie Borden are four:  Portrait of Lizzie; photo of murder house; arrest log; and the entrance to Oak Grove Cemetery.<BR>I enjoyed this well-done book.

Most of the usual beloved characters are here as well as a new one - attorney Kloughn (Clown) - who I'd like to see remain as a regular.  Stephanie's main task in this book is to find a missing woman and her daughter, as she is stalked by a relentless mobster. The problem I have with this book is that some of the situations are not believable.  The author does not give Stephanie a really good reason to keep seeking the woman after the mobster keeps trying to kill her.  The reader has to ask themselves, 'Why is she continuing with this??'  I think Ms. Evanovich went a little too far stretching our imaginations in this book in several situations, to the point where she brings us out of the novel back into reality, darn it.  On the other hand, things heat up between Stephanie and Ranger. That, and the general good read the book provides, as all of the &quot;Plum&quot; books thus far, makes this a must read.	2003-09-17

This is a story Ms. Evanovich had written earlier and resurrected it now that she's famous, adding some things to it for this publication.

Who was he?  What was he doing there?  Did he leave a safe desk job for adventure?  Or was he terrified of going?  Unfortunately, I did not learn much about Mr. Kellogg.  No fault of the author's, who did a fantastic job researching this man with a rather obscure background.  There just isn't much information about him as a person to be found.  Yet Mr. Barnard pieced together the best story he possibly could thru newspaper accounts, many sources he found and contact with the Kellogg descendants (who did not know they were related to him until the author told them!).  The book is not terribly entertaining, but it was not written for that purpose.  All four of Kellogg's columns he wrote on the Last Stand march are reprinted, along with what was left of his diary. We get a personal look at General Custer - the last written look at him in life.  And we learn some new things about that expedition, as we feel as if we are riding right along with them.

A movie was made of the novel in the 1960's with Elizabeth Hartman as Selina; Sidney Potier as Gordon; Shelley Winters as the mother; and Wallace Ford as &quot;Ole Pa&quot;, the grandfather.  The movie stays true to the book, which is wonderful as the book is so beautifully written.  It really made a statement for racial equality in its time and still does today.  It's a short book, and worth the investment of both time and money for a story you will never forget.	2003-05-13

Remembering Judy Carne and all the rest of the Laugh-in cast, this is quite a trip down memory lane.  The book tells how she got started in show business and her early marriage to Burt Reynolds.  She shares what it was like being married to him.  Let's just say they're not married anymore ... Her honesty with her heroin addiction is to be admired, along with all she went through physically when restrained to a steel neck cage after an accident.  Not only is her life interesting, but the little nuggets of Hollywood inside stories are just as good.  Pick up this juicy morsel if you can find it.	2003-05-13

I was glad, because I didn't enjoy this at all and that is rare for me to dislike something by Robert Bloch.  It's a most forgettable book.  It's good to obtain to see what it's like.  But for entertainment purposes, I'd watch the movie instead.  The movie takes us back to the Bates Motel with Norman getting out of the mental hospital after many years. And that's what we expect when we hear &quot;Psycho II&quot;.  Not this.	2003-05-13

When a pillar of Charleston's society invites Abby to tea and then dies, Abby tries to save her rep by finding the killer.  This is the first book that shows Abby in her new home, Charleston, and as a new bride.  Mom lives right in with Abby (how could we not have Mozella around?).  Friends CJ and the Rob-Bobs visit.  The plot is excellent and full of surprises.  Additional characters are kept few, interesting and uncomplicated.  Ms. Myers' humor does not seem to kick in until the last parts of the book.  Again she relies on past phrases that have gotten her laughs in prior books but are now old to us.  The paint shaker at the Home Depot &amp; a sandwich short of a picnic were worn and tired phrases several books ago.  Her repeated use of &quot;wailed&quot; can get irritating, and I don't know why she brings up &quot;my good friend, Madgalena Yoder&quot; (her main character from her other, Penn-Dutch, mystery series) so often.  Once would have been fun.  I may sound like an ungrateful reader, and I am not.  She continues to be a top favorite.  In spite of these flaws that keep me from giving it 5 stars, this is still one of her best.  Don't miss it.	2003-05-08

You can't read ahead. The writing is too good to miss a word of.  And the author has a way of sneaking up on you with the action when you don't expect it.

Though Ms. Ripley writes well enough, and she can follow a mystery plot formula, I was surprised at the sheer boredom of it all.  Unless you like plants.  Really like plants. The characters were one-dimensional, the dialogue stilted, and any attempts at humor fell flat.  Outside of a good climactic scene, the rest of the story had me sitting there wondering when something interesting was going to happen.  I think the author missed her chances at using the characters to make the book sparkle.  I couldn't wait to finish this one, but not because it was a page turner.	2002-12-21

This one was the worst yet.  Abby over-reacts a lot (as she does in several of the later books) and once again the humor is just not there.  The victim in this story is Tweetie, Abby's ex-husband's wife.  It took about 50 pages before we know there's been a murder, as the author takes us through chapters of unnecessary prose that went nowhere.  Abby's involvement in this murder sounds contrived, and we don't really care when there is a second victim.  Abby's sleuthing is poor, and her realization of who the killer is is barely sensible.  The killer him or herself is revealed at the end with not much to lead up to it, though Abby's face-off with him or her was enjoyable.  Abby moves to another town at the end of this book.  Let's hope her move benefits the entertainment value in the series.	2002-11-04

Although the book takes Abby to a different locale (Savannah) there isn't much action in it.  Ms. Myers' humor is not up to par in comparison to her other books.  Some of the plot and characters seem contrived - too coincidental, and it just didn't make her usual grade.  I downright dislike what she did with Abby's mother in this one.  It's way out there.

Told in a diary format, Daisy Fay shares with us her life from age 11 thru high school as she grows up in 1950's Mississippi.  You'd swear she's real. The book is hilarious, fast paced, and warm.  My only near-complaint is 'Who is the Miracle Man?'  I finished the book and stared at the cover for a long time, thinking back through the story,trying to figure out who is meant by that title, and I couldn't come up with an answer.  The book was previously published as &quot;Coming Attractions&quot;, and I think they should have left that title alone.

Though a good part of the book is about his time spent with Bonnie and Clyde, it's also about his own career in crime and the atrocities of the Texas prison system of the era.  The book is well written and also very well researched.  The author is to be applauded for his extensive list of resources.  Mr. Fults, the ex-gang member, does put a sympathetic spin on Barrow and Parker.  But he was there, and he got to know them in a different way than a lawman or reporter.  The book contains some good photos, many which were new to me.  Well done!	2002-07-07

I was pleasantly surprised to see that it's a reference book, comprised of everyone who was ever involved personally in the Lizzie Borden murder case.  Bios are listed alphabetically and I can't think of anyone Mr. Hoffman's left out.  I gave this book 4 stars because there are some errors here and there, and more photos of those we don't usually see would have been fantastic.  Still, it's a good piece of work and fascinating whether you're looking up a person or if you just want to sit and read it cover to cover.  Don't miss it before it becomes unavailable, as many Lizzie Borden books do.	2002-06-26

Abby takes part in a &quot;find the missing antique&quot; game weekend, given at a wealthy woman's mansion.  Someone ends up dead, and poor &quot;C.J.&quot; - an ongoing character who is at times hilarious - confesses.  Abby meets a new boyfriend, quite different from the drop-dead gorgeous types she always seems to get - a character I hope remains in the series in whatever capacity is his fictional fate.  It's starting to get just a little bit unbelievable that Abby keeps getting these fabulous looking guys one right after another.  This deviation from her usual path makes it a little more down to earth.  I have to say I don't like Abby as much as I do the heroine of Ms. Myers' &quot;Pennsylvania Dutch&quot; mysteries, Magdalena Yoder.  She is a little on the nasty side more times than I care for.  She gets sympathy for her husband having left her and taken everything from her.  Maybe that's why Ms. Myers makes her a little tough.  In any event, this book does not disappoint.  It's worth every penny.	2002-06-26

When Abby finds someone is selling reproductions as the real thing, her sleuthing takes her to Hernia, PA.  Abby meets Magdalena - the main character from her Penn/Dutch mysteries.  I couldn't wait till she got there.  The book is fun reading all the way thru, with Ms. Myers staying on top of her trademark humor.  However, a couple things are bothersome.  A look-alike for Abby is added into this book, which was better suited to save for another book - it seemed like too many coincidences in the story, having that plus Hernia.  The handling of Greg Washburn does not make a lot of sense and makes us like Abby less, which is not good for series writing.  This book also made me wonder if the editor was on vacation.  Quite a few typos, which were distracting.  Still it gets high points for the entertaining read that it is.  I hope Abby and Magdalena meet again some day.	2002-05-28

The plot was good.  But her trademark humor seemed lacking until the latter stages of the story.  A woman is driven through Abby's store window, leaving a mysterious Ming vase behind.  Joining a preservation committee to gain access to the mansion the deceased worked at opens up a whole new subplot where ghosts and the beautifully described areas of Charleston are a true treat.  Abby's mother has more of a role in this book, and it's a pleasure to get to know her.  Worth the read, but lacks the usual humor, darn it.	2002-05-24

Frankly I didn't expect a 9th book to be as strong in plot or humor as the others, but I was happily surprised to find \\"Crepes...\\" every bit as good as the rest.  Drugs come to Hernia (oh my!) and Melvin asks Magdalena's help in solving a murder as he runs his policital campaign. This book does not disappoint.	2002-05-24

When one of the town's writers gives Jacob his manuscript just before dropping dead, Jacob sees it as his responsibility to find out what the words in the notebooks mean and who might have killed him, if indeed he was killed.

Abby Timberlake is the owner of an antique shop in the south.  When her aunt is murdered, she sets about to find the killer.  You don't want to read ahead, because that would mean missing out on Ms. Myers' sparkling wit and humor that peppers each page.  The reading goes fast since it's a page-turner, and the time spent is truly a relaxing, enjoyable escape.  I won't even complain about the price of paperbacks with a book like this.  Worth every penny.  I've read all of Ms. Myers' Penn-Dutch mysteries.  I was happy to see that this series is quite unlike her other.  Characters are different, more liberal and not as restrained because of their religion as in the Penn-Dutch books.  The plot was thick enough, and the killer a real surprise.  A pure pleasure.	2002-04-05

The characterizations are well done with the group evolving into special friends.  The book has been compared to the Mitford Series, and I did not find it to be so.  Every  book taking place in the south and having a church as its background does not a Mitford book make.  The book lacks the sparkling characters, dialogue and for the most part deep-down warmth that the Mitford series brings us.  However, by book's end I found myself just getting to know the characters and liking them.  I would like to see a sequel to &quot;Friendship Cake&quot; with the same cast.	2002-03-25

The plot is thicker than some of the others, when Nazi war criminals are sought in Hernia.  Magdalena is perhaps at her best, as well as Freni.  When you see both of their names on the same page, you know you're in for a treat.  A couple neat, new characters come into play (hopefully they'll stay).

It's a victory for women everywhere who have been stalked by men they want to break up with. I find in many of Ms. Rule's books she gives a little too much detail on the lives of the good guys - cops &amp; detectives. But here she gives bare bones on them and concentrates on the main characters. A great book.	2001-09-25

The book deals with Lizzie and her life in the 'house of hate' with her father, step-mother and sister, Emma. Most books about Lizzie Borden mention the house as being bland, without 'modern' conveniences, closed-in, locked up, but they don't go into detail. Ms. Engstrom's book does an excellent job of making the reader feel that claustrophobic building around Lizzie and, therefore, giving us a better understanding of Lizzie's real life character. The character of Lizzie, however, is portrayed as &quot;too good&quot; - I was waiting for her to be made into a Saint at the end of the book. The character of Emma was made into an alcoholic slut who took mysterious trips to a nearby town, coming back with bruises on her covered face. The book suffers much from Emma's far out characterization. Ending with the murders, we are left with one of those politically correct guilt trips. Yeah, Lizzie did it. But it's OKAY!	2001-08-26

I simply loved every page. Even when nothing of note is happening, Ms. Myers keeps you entertained with her wonderful sense of humor. The second in this series, a murder occurs at the Penn/Dutch Inn when a Hollywood crew comes out to make a movie about the murder that occurred in the first book, &quot;Too Many Crooks Spoil the Broth&quot;. Ms. Myers doesn't need all that high tech and explicit sex that goes into so many books today. Her heroine, Magdalena Yoder, doesn't even have a computer and is still a virgin at 44. She's plucky, quick witted and has enough courage to win the reader's admiration. In this book, we meet Magdalena's telephone suitor who owns a fast food chicken &amp; shrimp place, &quot;Jumbo Jim's&quot;, while being pursued by an old schoolmate who grew up drop dead gorgeous, and an 84 year old veterinarian -who sometimes works on people. Being suspected of the crime by the police chief spurs Magdalena on to try to find the real killer. It's a page turner from start to finish. The woman has TALENT.	2001-08-26

Torme tells the story with frankness and reveals both a negative side of Miss Garland and a sad one.  Her middle-of-the-night calls to talk her insomnia away, her drug use, and dislike of Mr. Torme make for a juicy, nostalgic trip.  How, no matter what condition she was in or how little rehearsal she had, she still performed like the pro she was is shared with readers without bias (and we thought they looked so happy together in that Christmas show!).  The show has long been cancelled and both beloved performers are gone now.  But luckily this piece of them remains.  More than just a book, it's a piece of Americana - a piece of history - and a piece of time in the lives of all of us who remember them.  A must for any Garland or Torme fan.	2001-08-21

Books	5	0	0	N	Y	Flagg is Fabulous	You're made to feel welcome in this world immediately upon starting the first few pages of this wonderfully written novel.  Fanny Flagg shows that she can not only create characters who are down-home, charming and folksy but also complex ones that are self-destructive, in need of psycho-analysis.  (And I thought she was only a panelist on The Match Game!)  Part of the story takes place in New York, centering around a young  tv news anchorwoman (Deena); part takes place in Deena's home town.  Eventually the two come together, as Deena searches for clues to her past.  Get ready for many hours of entertainment with this one.	2001-08-18

But I must say that &quot;...Wary&quot; left me weary.  I found much of the narrative to be repeated from other books in the series.  The characters were for the most part uninteresting, and the plot line a bit thin.  Ms. Myers was not up to her usual standards on this one.  Buy it?  Yes!  How can we miss out on one, even if it's a little undercooked?	2001-08-16

From start to finish this page turner is full of kooky characters that we quickly cherish (well, most of them), a hilarious narrative, and a darned good mystery to boot.  Not to mention the recipes!  A pure pleasure to read.  Thank you, Ms. Myers!	2001-08-16

Who could ever be ready to have Bette Davis, in the flesh, come and stay in our own home?  What was supposed to be a few days turns into months for our admirable author, who tries to the best of her ability to do the impossible - please Ms. Davis.  <br />Ms. Fuller lives many of our dreams come true when she takes on what turns to be an arduous task.  It doesn't take long for the movie queen to wear out her welcome.  Though Bette keeps Ms. Fuller hopping, the end result is a beautiful book of an inside day to day look at one of our most beloved stars.  Davis fans should love it.	2001-08-16

Mm, mm, good!  &quot;The Hand that Rocks the Ladle&quot; had me hooked from the first page, when an old man claims to be pregnant.  A book like this, I thought, has to be different.  I was not disappointed.  Ms. Myers writes a most entertaining novel with lots of humor, charming characters, a good mystery and to top it all off includes recipes served at the main character's B &amp; B.  I was only saddened when the book was over.  This was my first in the series.  I immediately ordered all of her others.	2001-06-20

What otherwise was a most private family, Reeve opens the door to their New England home and lets us see the personal side of Charles and Anne.  She writes honestly, though at times it must hurt, and does address the subject of the kidnapping head on.  If you've ever had an interest in any facet of the Lindberghs' life, do not miss this important book.	2001-06-10

Books	3	7	9	N	N	No Style With Lyle	This book consists of transcripts of some phone conversations between Lyle Menendez and the author before and during the brothers' first trial.  You really need to be up on the case to know what's being said.  If you know who everyone was in the trial (Dr. Oziel, Judalon Smyth, etc.) then the book can be of some use to you.  Don't look here for a compelling description of the crime, the planning, or even life at home with the Menendez'.  What you will get is an insight into the character we know as Lyle - confirming the intelligent, cunning, cold hearted manipulator we knew gratis Court TV.  The book is historically important as a trial supplement and reading is recommended to those familiar with the case.	2001-03-27

It does not compare with Bella Stumbo's &quot;Until the Twelfth of Never&quot;, which should be top choice if you  want a very thorough (but not in the least boring) read on it. The author  gives a good representation of Betty's point of view, while at the same  time stressing the total wrongness of her acts.  With a double murder, high  society, and the intriguing character of Betty Broderick you can't go too  wrong picking this up. Can we ever get enough of this one?	2000-02-02

If you're looking for an in-depth bio on her, this is not it.  However &quot;Forever Lucy&quot;  would make a fine second book to read about Lucy, to fill in some cracks  others have left room for.<br />The book reads fast and does hold your  interest.  In most areas there is simply not enough detail.  Perhaps this  was intentional.  But when we get to the part of Desi's death, we do expect  more than a small paragraph stating that &quot;in recent years his health  had deteriorated rapidly&quot;.<br />The many interviews given by Lucy &amp;  Desi over the years the authors use may make this an important resource  material for Lucy researchers/fans if those sources are not readily  available elsewhere.  The authors do go into more detail than is usually  done on the accusation in the '50s of Lucy's supposed communist activities.  Also the business side of Lucy when she took over as head of Desilu are  more detailed than other books on her.  <br />Read it?  Yes.  But make it  second on your Lucy bio list.	2000-01-25

A page turner, the book is both easy to  read and gripping.  If you are looking for a Custer book that is factual  and makes you feel like you are there, you will not go wrong with this. You  can just about smell the gunpowder and hear the arrows whizzing by.   It's  hard to believe this is the author's first novel.  Hopefully he has  continued to write others since.  I could not put this down.	1999-12-27
