It gives you a number of ways to find a word including wildcards, Boolean searches, definition searches, and of course a good old A-Z search. What I found particularly useful was the 120,000+ audio pronunciations. Frankly, phonetic spelling has always given me a headache, especially with words like &quot;ennui&quot;. I also found the spot maps and illustrations helpful. What's more, you can run this dictionary without the CD-ROM in the drive. (providing you are willing to give up a couple of the bells and whistles)<br />The only thing I really don't like about this software is that it is a full on pain in the neck to get it to function as your Word Dictionary. (even thought it is supposed to) This could possibly been alleviated by at least some rudimentary instructions. There are some on the CD, but they are vague at best. Oh well, not a perfect world.<br />All in all a good product for what it does, although I must admit I do miss the weight of a hardcover unabridged dictionary..	2001-02-22

I bought this, not too long ago, for a friend of mine who is a high school English teacher. She raves about how helpful it is to her in class and how much the kids enjoy using it.<br />She has stressed its value so much that I now feel it is a must for my reference library. After all we've all been there, trying to find a rhymne for that odd word. It's like trying to think of a synonym something and there not a thesaurus to be found.	2001-02-22

What could be more gloriously pretentious that a book with this title. In its defense, however, there are some very viable synonyms that I have found useful. I does, as the author suggests, remind you of those little used words that bring descriptive writing a certain zest.<br />On the other hand, the book has a limited amount of entries, and some of the synonyms are a bit far fetched. If you are looking for a dependable thesaurus you can you in day-to-day writing try Roget's. But if you find you need a particularly noteworthy word this isn't a bad little addition.	2001-02-22

Not only are you provided with nearly half a million synonyms, but Rogets make the definition conise and meaningful.<br />You will find this book an essential part of your reference section be it 2 books or 200 books in volume. It makes little difference if you are writing a term paper or a business letter, you are foolish not to have this vital tool.	2001-02-22

Then I decided to see what other reviewers said about it. After seeing s number of positive reviews, I begrudgingly decided I'd give it a shot.<br />As it turns out Garrison is now one of my favorite authors. For me, Garrison has an energetic style of writing that makes the plotline of Red Sky fly along. I found the characters engrossing and easy to relate to. Garrison keeps you flipping the pages with an interesting mix of suspense and thriller action.<br />I would compare Garrison to M. Cricton or an abridged Clancy. While Red Sky will never win any great awards, I did find it more interesting that Branford's Red Sky, which is what I originally intended to buy.	2001-02-17

Most lack organization or detail that make them useful or user friendly.<br />This is one of the few books that I find myself referring to and recommending repeatedly. Students from 16-60 tell me that this books is easy to follow. The book is well organized, clear, and consistent. For instance, if you need to find out how to do a Works Cited Page, this book walks you through it in a nearly fool-proof example.<br />After using this book for awhile, I found not only did I prefer using it, but I didn't have to keep explaining to my students how to do basic writing skills. I would tell them where to find something and they would pick it up.<br />Besides basic research information there are a number of tips on writing, structure, and organizing that my students have found helpful. It might be silly, but one of the things I like best about this book is it is small, ring bound, and is tabbed to its major parts. It seems someone finally figured out the key to a good writing reference guide is &quot;easy access&quot;.	2001-02-17

I generally give out this book with a couple of others that i use for reference, because unlike the  others it doesn't stand real well all on its own.<br />I find the articles  interesting, and the annotated script is very useful, but that is about  where it ends. There really aren't any of the worksheet or quizzes that you  might expect. I like to use this book if I am going to look at the play in  great depth, but if you plan on covering it quickly (less than a month)  this should be a choice, but probably not the first one if you're on a  budget.	2000-05-19

I found his advice useful, and I still use a number of those ideas today. Coming from a department that didn't stress classroom  management very well, I found this book to be priceless.<br />This is a book  you need to read BEFORE the &quot;First Days of School&quot;. Some of the  ideas take awhile to implement and many of them need to be in place from  day one. You can't change you rules two or three times and not expect to  upset the apple cart (no pun intended).<br />The only real drawback I saw in  this book is, like so many things in education, this book is largely geared  toward elementary teaching. Although it is useful to a secondary teacher,  it really shines for the elementary teacher.<br />I don't have my original  copy anymore. It has been passed down to new teachers over the last couple  years, but each of them has found it useful.	2000-05-19

Nevertheless I love King's work despite the need to occasionally pace  myself with it. This book, however, was magnificent.

They provide not only  definitions and summaries, but analysis as well.<br />I found they did an  especially good job of breaking down the first 3 chapters that is so filled  with technical language that students often become lost and disinterested  in an otherwise wonderful book about the human condition.<br />I have found  more and more of my students that use these books perform better on my  tests, and have deeper and more meaningful papers than those that don't.

When a new teacher is  stuck, this is one of the books that I loan them.<br />For the experienced  teacher, or someone who considers themself well-versed in Shakespeare, this  book is a little elementary.

I think Gordon does a great job of catching the reader's attention while teaching  some very (I'm sorry but it's true) dry material. I teach it, and even I  hate reading about it!<br />By no stretch of the imagination is this the best  book on grammar out. Nor is this the best book written on the subject. I  would equate it to a grammar coffee break. It's useful, but also pleasant.  If you want a hyper-organized, get the answer quick reference book this is  a poor choice.
