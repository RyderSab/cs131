School reform has a long history over the past two centuries. It is usual to blame schools and teachers for any current perceived failures. Those who condemn current educational practices also believe schools can make a better society, and are a solution for individual failures and larger social problems.<br />&quot;Aside from the general lack of evidence concerning young children's experience using computers, there remains the pervasive belief among educators and parents about the inevitability of a future in which today's children will require technological competencies to succeed in the workplace. It is that belief, and not any research findings, that propels parents and educators to invest in preschools and computers&quot; (p.65).<br />The students who had substantial expertise with computers all gained their expertise outside of school, usually on home computers (p.91). That's because learning about a computer requires much more time than the hour or two a week available at school. The traditional method of teaching is for a knowledgeable person to lecture the students. This method dates back to ancient times: those who know, teach. &quot;In the schools we studied, we found no clear and substantial evidence of students increasing their academic achievement as a result of using information technologies&quot; (p.133).<br />&quot;Are teeachers' responses to computers similar to earlier technologies?&quot; Films, radio, and television showed no improvement over conventional practices; they also had logistical problems. This &quot;unexpected outcome&quot; resulted in blaming teachers, not poorly designed hardware and software and the political organizational structure. Pages 144 and 148 tell of real-world experiences.<br />Why was so much money pumped into schools in the 1990s? Was it a political decision to create markets and use up tax dollars? Page 157 says critics blamed schools for America's loss of global markets (!!!), which imagines some lost golden age. Page 158 tells of public opinion polls, which may only regurgitate the propaganda previously swallowed. Purchasing hardware and software or wiring schools were symbolic political gestures as much as attempts to acquire the right tools, even with little evidence that information technologies raise test scores or promote better teaching. Pages 159-166 give a short history of schooling since the late 19th century, and current practice. Page 168 gives a check-list on rating hardware and software for schools.<br />Chapter Six summarizes the book and should be read by everyone who is interested in this subject. Computers in classrooms have NOT led to higher teacher and student productivity, or transformed teaching and learning; they are oversold and underused.	2002-01-02

His father saved souls, Earl saved men from the hangman. Earl first worked as a newspaper reporter,  then learned law working for Senator Stephen M. White (another heavy drinker).<br />Earl Rogers invented many of the tactics that have become common criminal law stratagem. He was the first American lawyer to use the science of ballistics, and was at the leading edge of medical forensic science. Rogers assisted in performing over 30 autopsies, and been present for 70 others. He saved one client from hanging after an exhumation failed to find a shot to the head that several eyewitnesses testified to seeing. Rogers was among the first to use charts and blackboards in the courtroom, along with scale models, to get his point across to a jury. Out of 77 important murder cases he lost only 3. He always dressed in the height of fashion to make a good impression. The practice of law was like being an actor on a stage before an audience.<br />Rogers did extensive research into the background of the jurors. The practice of jury investigation was  long in use by the early twentieth century; it is not a recent phenomenon. His father Lowell once rebuked him for any attempt to save a man, known by him to be guilty, by dishonest or deceptive means.<br />When Clarence Darrow was indicted for bribery, Earl Rogers (who had worked for the &quot;Merchants and Manufacturers Association&quot;) defended him. Darrow's private detective bribed a juror, was arrested, then turned state's evidence. Later this private detective claimed the payoff came from Samuel Gompers himself! Page 189 tells how this detective previously worked with the US Marshals office, then went to the District Attorney's office before working for Darrow. When this detective left his meeting with the special federal prosecutor, he carried the bribe money (p.191)! (Was this detective a double agent? Did Earl Rogers learn this from his business friends?) Roger's defense was that Darrow was in the process of negotiating a plea bargain, and a stingy Darrow would not spend all that money on a bribe when the case would not go to trial: he had no motive (p.196)! The jury said &quot;not guilty&quot; after just 35 minutes of deliberation. Darrow had trouble on another case, and was forced to surrender his Calif. bar license, effectively removing him from any future cases.<br />As you read through these famous cases, how many of them remind you of stories seen on TV over the years? Adela R. St. Johns, eyewitness and journalist, wrote a longer and more colorful biography. Rogers could have gone on to higher national fame, except for his drinking and womanizing, Adela said. But given the scandals of Representatives, Senators, and Presidents, maybe it was only a lack of the right connections?	2001-12-26

New York was the most important city then, and is the center for finance, insurance, fashion, publishing, broadcasting, and other national businesses.<br />Our Revolution, and afterwards, put an end to any aristocracy of large landowners. DeTocqueville noted how the &quot;law of partition&quot; replaced entailment and did away with large estates by forcing their dissolution thru the inheritance laws. The author notes that few historical studies were written to document this &quot;upper class&quot; of that time, given its importance then, and now. He tells how a &quot;class culture&quot; was expressed in shared habits and manners (such as a dining room), interior design, gender roles, and the concept of &quot;society&quot;&quot; clubs, debutante balls, voluntary associations, etc. These habits all required wealth that excluded the majority of the people. The goal of this book is to explain the role of the &quot;upper class&quot; in the history of New York and the nation.<br />The author says that workers can only be powerful when they act collectively in trade unions or politics, while the &quot;upper class&quot; exert power through their wealth (p.13).<br />New York's preeminence in European trade gave its impetus to manufacturing that supplied much of the growing nation. Upper class New Yorkers represented the largest and most diverse of the economic elite, surpassing other cities. New York was most involved in the cotton trade then. Banking, extending credit for future crops, grew out of commerce; it became more profitable than merchandising. European capital was used.<br />Page 31 tells the reason why merchant houses could no then be incorporated for limited liability: they lacked a public purpose. Page 33 tells of the importance of proper marriages to merchant companies. Marrying the boss' daughter was not just Horatio Alger fiction. Most wealth then was due to inheritance (p.36). A display of luxury began to replace democratic simplicity (p.42). Funerals developed as a public ritual.<br />One feature of the expansion of the 1850s was the creation of socially exclusive neighborhoods (p.55). It continued the separation of workplace and home: commuting was invented! Political clubs, like the Chamber of Commerce, were formed to support the policies of the merchants and bankers. New social clubs, like the Union Club, were formed to unite the merchants and financial elite. Churches also became exclusive to the elites and shifted locations to follow the wealthy.<br />Page 78 tells how the merchants and bankers interests were allied with the Southern planters, while manufacturers were not. The increasing political power of ordinary people led to public works that benefitted ordinary people. He tells how the wealthy learned to influence a party by funding the organization in the 1850s. Page 81 tells of the effects of political decisions on commerce. The elites needed votes to get their agenda across; but since their agenda was against the interests of the voters it failed to win. So they resorted to lobbying and corruption to further their agenda (p.83). The merchants and financiers involved in the cotton trade supported the Democratic Party and its attempts to reconcile sectional differences. Manufacturers supported the new Republican Party. <br />New Yorks's banks were an enormous source of money for the federal government. In effect, they were the only source for bonds and loans. The federal government raised money with an excise tax and an income tax (p.118). The Civil War and high tariffs turned the US towards the West and away from cotton exports and European imports. It helped manufacturing, and not just for the war effort.<br />While the book's 330 pages of text seem aimed at a general audience, the 130 pages of notes is too long.	2001-12-20

And not because of its unimportance! There's the story of Peggy Eaton, and how she caused the Civil War (p.43). How William Chancellor's home was raided by Secret Service agents who forced him to burn his papers; later the FBI seized copies of his book from libraries, stores, and salesmen, even confiscating and destroying the publication plates without any legal authorization (p.127). How the Republican National Committee shipped Harding's mistress and husband on an all-expenses-paid trip to the Far East in 1920, and a $2000 monthly payoff in hush money.<br />The author says that newspapers of the 1920s kept the stories about Harding unpublished because &quot;there was no real appetite for that kind of story&quot; (p.130). I think its more likely that 1) we now had a &quot;secret police on the European model&quot;, and 2) the increasing monopolization of newspapers allowed more control and censorship. Some may think only some weekly newspapers market scandals, but don't recognize this as a niche market. The facts that supermarkets nationwide were told to market weekly tabloids around 1967 isn't mentioned, or the cause.<br />The book says movie stars replaced politicians (and the rich?) in the 1920s as objects of gossip. When Fatty Arbuckle was found not guilty of murder on the third trial after six minutes of deliberation the press wondered &quot;about what was wrong with the system of justice and whether it was possible for a celebrity to get a fair trial in America&quot; (p.140).<br />Pages 144-5 tell of the rumors and gossip about FDR: he was a drunk, going insane, addicted to drugs, even that he was a &quot;hopeless, helpless invalid&quot;. Pages 175-6 explain how memories become improved decades after the events: reading history backwards. <br />Pages 183-6 tell of the Walter Jenkins scandal of Oct 1964. The author omits the fact thatWalter Jenkins was a Colonel in the Air Force Reserve, and served under General Barry Goldwater. LBJ's first reaction was to assume a plot to affect the election. I wonder is there's a reason for Goldwater's later statements?<br />In 1972 Senator Thomas Eagleton was dropped as a VP candidate when they found he had been &quot;hospitalized three times for mental illness and depression&quot; (p.190). Watergate opened the door to printed political gossip that has pestered, or enriched, the news from Washington DC. One effect was a huge increase in college journalism students then.<br />Ronald Reagan was the first president who was divorced. There was no sexual gossip about the 70 year old Reagan; nobody told of his bad memory, either. He was the first president whose staff wrote tell-all books while he was still in the White house (p.224).<br />Pages 228-232 discuss Senator John Tower and his failure to be voted Secretary of Defense in 1989 due to his drinking and womanizing. I heard the real reason was Senator Tower's earlier whitewash of the &quot;Contragate&quot; investigation; he wasn't trusted.<br />Pages 247-8 tell how rumors and were used to try to influence the selection of Speaker of the House circa 1990. You can watch the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; to see how jokes and phony videos are used to shape people's thinking on current issues. The hired tongues on local &quot;talk radio&quot; may provide other examples or rumors from nearly anonymous sources.<br />Page 267 says that people react angrily to scandals about a famous person's private life only when the reality contradicts the image. A politician known for drinking, gambling, and kissing any woman within reach can't be ruined except by a Federal indictment and conviction. A Louisiana Governor said no scandal would harm him unless he was found in bed with a dead girl or a live boy.<br />The author says gossip meets human needs by sharing secrets that are normally hidden, etc. (p.6). I think its people's wayto bring down the high and mighty as just another human. To quote from a folksong of the 60s, &quot;even the President goes&quot;.	2001-12-20

The &quot;Selected Bibliography&quot; lists many of the books on the JFK Assassination; it does not have David E. Scheim's &quot;Contract on America&quot;, Mark North's &quot;Act of Treason&quot;, of Fletcher Prouty's book on the JFK Assassination Plot.<br />On page 273 Nixon says of Watergate &quot;the problem is it tracks back to the Bay of Pigs&quot;.... H.R. Haldeman's book said &quot;the Bay of Pigs&quot; was Nixon's code word for the JFK Assassination! Earlier pages tell of Nixon's connection to Murray Chotiner, Allen Dorfman, Charles Rebozo, etc. Pages 276-278 give a short history of Big Oil's influence.<br />JFK's Executive Order 11,110 called for the issuance of United States Notes by the Treasury, rather than borrowing currency from the Private Banking Cartel (&quot;Federal Reserve System&quot;) and paying about $100 million a year in interest (p.275). This would lead to a lower deficit and less in taxes. Jim Marrs' &quot;Rule By Secrecy&quot; tells how the Federal Reserve System was created in 1912.<br />Page 303 tells about the &quot;Training Under the Mutual Training Program&quot; document. Its plan was to encourage coup d'etat by foreign military controlled by America. The 1960s saw many examples in South America, Burma, South Vietnam, etc. The purpose was to create reserves of cheap labor for use by American corporations after they shut down and dismantled domestic factories, or, captive markets for the products if these corporations.<br />Pages 340-345 discuss the murder of Officer J.D. Tippit, and the problems in claiming Oswald did it. Officer J.M. Poe stated he put his initials on two cartridge cases found there; they were missing from the inventoried evidence. One of the bullets did not match its case, and none of the bullets could be matched to Oswald's revolver! Page 353 tells of two witnesses present at the Texas Theater who say Oswald was there at 1PM,before Tippit was killed. Page 354 tells of another young man arrested and taken out the rear door.<br />Pages 363-365 tell about the finding of Commission Exhibit 399, the &quot;magic bullet&quot; that provided a link to Oswald's rifle. The Parkland chief of security said the bullet had a pointed tip, not the round nose of CE 399. Newsman Seth Kantor said Jack Ruby was there at the hospital (p.366).<br />Pages 373-376 tell of the &quot;alterations&quot; in the President's wounds: the shots from the front witnessed in Dallas became shots from the rear in Bethesda! The Dallas doctors said the right rear portion of the head was missing. The Bethesda doctors said the wound stretched from the upper side of the rear to the right front. Instead of &quot;alterations&quot;, could they have used a &quot;body double&quot;?<br />Dorothy Kilgallen, a syndicated columnist for Hearst, had a private interview with Jack Ruby; she told friends &quot;I'm going to break the real story and have the biggest scoop of the century&quot;. But she was soon found dead of an overdose of alcohol and pills (p.424-426). No trace of her notes or writings about Jack Ruby were ever found.<br />When Jack Ruby was interviewed by the Warren Commission on 6-7-64, he said his life was in danger in Dallas, and he could tell more if he was brought to Washington. Earl Warren refused (p.427). Ruby's secrets died with him; he developed lung cancer in prison.<br />Pages 435-436 tell of the witnesses's stories about the origins of the shots. Do different sources show unreliability, or shots from different locations?<br />&quot;All in all, there is not one single piece of physical evidence used against Oswald that cannot be called into question. This evidence must be considered in light of the possibility that much of it could have been planted for the purpose of incriminating Oswald in the assassination&quot; (p.458).	2001-12-09

Simpson Trial (Famous Trials Series)	Books	2	3	6	N	N	A Simplified Story of the Trial	The trial of OJ Simpson was one of the famous and controversial events of the 1990s. Now that it is past, we can better see it in perspective. If OJ was guilty, he would have to quickly dispose of the bloody clothes, shoes, knives so they would never be found, yet take home the socks and glove! I don't believe this. The red liquid blood from the two victims says they were murdered around 11:30PM. The limousine driver was there at 10:45 and drove OJ to the airport at this time. OJ was \\"100 per cent not guilty\\". The coroner who did the autopsies said \\"the forensic evidence says the murders occurred after 11PM\\".<br />The \\"Foreword\\" says laws contain the rules of a society in written (or unwritten) form. They are subject to change, like the conditions that create them. Cicero said \\"true law is right reason in agreement with nature\\". But reason varies with people over time, and \\"nature\\" is but a name given to a particular set of facts. A better definition of \\"law\\" is the power of some groups to use the tool of government to serve their purpose. \\"Cui bono\\" said the Romans - \\"for whose benefit\\"?<br />Just at midnight Sunday June 12, 1994 a couple saw the bleeding body of Nicole Brown Simpson. The police were called, and they found the body of Ron Goldman. The Medical Examiner was NOT called, so important evidence vanished forever! That Friday while OJ waited at lawyer Kardashian's home, AC Cowlings came over in his white Bronco and took OJ for a ride. <br />Page 52 has the claim that Nicole was killed due to jealousy, and Ron because he showed up. The 25-30 stab wounds on Ron suggests a personal hatred, the quick killing of Nicole implies she was the bystander. If Ron physically resembled Nicole's current boyfriend Keith, could it have been a case of mistaken identity?<br />Page 62 tells that Ron Goldman's work clothing was found in his apartment. This means he walked home to change before leaving again around 10:30PM! The book doesn't tell that he had earlier filed for bankruptcy to discharge $100,000 in debts; who would lend him money to buy a restaurant?<br />Pages 73-74 summarize the County Coroner's testimony at the trial. You can read the autopsy reports yourself for the description of two knives\\" single-edged knife, double-edged stilleto. The stab wounds on Ron's right front chest suggest left-handed killer, the wounds on Ron's right back suggest right-handed killer. You can read \\"Tainting Evidence\\" by Kelly and Wearnes for more details on the DNA testing in this case.<br />The highlight of the prosecution was the trying on of the crime scene gloves - they didn't fit! The gloves contained Caucasian limb hair from its previous owner. The Fuhrman tapes, and his refusal to testify again, marked the end of the trial.<br />Page 101 quotes Darden saying Paula broke up with OJ; her book says she visited him daily in jail, and through the second trial. Pages 107-108 does NOT tell the jury asked for a re-reading of the limousine driver's testimony; this convinced them to vote \\"not guilty\\".<br />Pages 111-113 tell how the trial and verdict was a litmus test of attitudes by blacks and whites. He doesn't say anything about the biased reporting by the media ('TIME' magazine darkened OJ's picture to hide the fact that OJ had no scratches or bruises). Nothing has happened since 1995 to contradict the jury's verdict. The whiney complaints about the verdict and jury system have ceased. ....	2001-12-01

Pearson was &quot;one of the best trial and crime reporters&quot; in the 1920s-30s. &quot;In all five cases, the determination of guilt or innocence rested on circumstantial evidence&quot;.<br />&quot;The Borden Case&quot; attracted national attention, and divided public opinion as no criminal prosecution had ever done before, or since. Families were divided, and argued over this fascinating case. The Bordens were not of a class where these crimes are common. The verdict did not solve this puzzle. On that &quot;intensely hot morning of Thursday, August 4, 1892&quot; (p.9) Andrew Jackson Borden walked back to his house. In half an hour he was dead; later the body of his pre-deceased wife Abby was found. His youngest daughter Lizzie was charged with these crimes, and found &quot;Not Guilty&quot;. This crime remained a mystery until Arnold R. Brown's &quot;Lizzie Borden: The Legend, the Truth, the Final Chapter&quot; was published in 1991 with its solution.<br />&quot;The Twenty-Third Street Murder&quot; of Friday, July 29, 1870 was of Benjamin Nathan, a New York financier. He was beaten to death in his own room, while his two sons slept in their house. The blood spattered walls and door spoke of a violent struggle; the open safe and empty cash box spoke to the motive (p.132). A newspaper pointed suspicion to one son of irregular morals. The inquest named no one. A convict in Sing Sing named a burglar. This burglar was found in Texas and brought to New York. But a case could not be made (p.155), and the suspect returned to jail in Illinois. It was never solved.<br />&quot;Mate Bram&quot; concerns the voyage of the barkentine 'Herbert Fuller' from Boston on July 3, 1896. Most of the crew was new to the ship and each other. The boat carried a load of lumber below and on top of the deck. There were some quarrels between the first and second mate. Early on the morning of July 14 the captain and his wife, along with the second mate, were murdered. The Grand Jury indicted Thomas Bram, the first mate (no bloodstains were found on him). Seaman Charley Brown testified he saw Bram kill the captain. Cross-examination revealed incidents from Brown's past that lessened his credibility. Bram was sentenced to life in prison; he served 15 years before being paroled. Six years later he was granted a full pardon. He became a prosperous businessman (p.224).<br />&quot;The Hunting Knife&quot; is about the murder of Mabel Page on March 31, 1904. Her retired father came home at 2:10PM and found her dead; money was missing from her purse. The police questioned all who had been in the neighborhood. One of these had his picture in the newspaper. A driver who gave him a ride saw this; he found a leather sheath for a knife afterwards. Charles Tucker was taken to the police station and given the usual warning of having his words used against him (p.241). While examining his overcoat, the police asked if this sheath was his; he admitted it was (!), then denied owning a knife. When his house was searched they found a pin of Mabel Page, and parts of a knife; he now admitted it was his. He was then arrested, tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death. No plea for mercy was considered (p.255).<br />&quot;Uncle Amos Dreams a Dream&quot; is about the Boorn case. Russell Colvin disappeared on May 10, 1812 from Manchester, Vermont. Seven years later his Uncle Amos dreamed that Russell was murdered by his brothers-in-law, and buried in a filled-up cellar hole. A dog began to dig by a hollow stump; bones were found. Some physicians said they were human, one didn't agree. Jesse Boorn was arrested, jailed, then admitted his brother did the killing. Stephen Boorn was arrested, but protested his innocence; he was chained in the &quot;inner dungeon&quot;. The Grand Jury indicted them both. Russell's son described a fight; a forger in jail testified to a confession from Stephen. Stephen then confessed and said it was self-defense. Both were found guilty and sentenced to death. The brothers protested their innocence, people petitioned the State Legislature. Jesse's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, Stephen was left to the gallows. The Rutland Herald printed an advertisement for Russell Colvin, and the death sentence of Stephen. The NY Evening Post reprinted an article from the Albany Daily Advertiser. A man from Shrewsbury NJ said a Russel Colvin from Manchester Vermont was living there. This person was asked to visit New York, then taken to Troy, then to Bennington. He was recognized and identified beyond all doubt. The Court was criticized for allowing a conviction without a dead body. A new trial was held, the charges dropped, and the Boorn brothers freed. They later moved to Ohio. People wondered why they would confess to a crime they didn't commit, but no answers were given except an &quot;Act of God&quot; (p.285).	2001-11-30

The failure of the German military to win the war by 1918 produced mutinies, revolution, and the end of their Second Empire by October 1918. A new republic was proclaimed, and the Armistice led to the treaty of Versailles. While the Kaiser fled to Holland, his military remained as a wanted burden to the new republic: it alone could suppress the revolutions breaking out all over Germany. This left them as the striking force fro a republic that they despised; eventually they came to support the Nazis (p.527) and a new European War. This seems like the inevitable result from the Allied failure to overthrow and purge the German ruling class, or divide the German Reich into separate nations, as was correctly done after World War II. Denazification and partition, plus grouping the small nations into large blocks, kept the peace for 50 years. But nothing lasts forever.<br />Woodrow Wilson gave many speeches on &quot;Democracy&quot;, but he was appointed President of Princeton, Governor of NJ, then President of the US through his personal ambition. Pages 15-20 tell of the contradictions and complexities in his personality. His dictatorial rule at Princeton led to his firing. A personal friendship allowed him to be nominated as the Democratic candidate for Governor of NJ. He promised to work with the &quot;organization&quot;, then reneged on his promises! He drafted a torrent of liberal legislation (as did Bismarck in the 1880s). He met Edward House, and insider and power broker in the national party. House's technique&quot; get a clean candidate and let the party organization do its job; it still works today! Jim  Marr's &quot;Rule By Secrecy&quot; tells how and why the 1912 election was fixed to create the private banking cartel that controls our economy. Running a third party candidate helped in 1980 and 1992.<br />Wilson's dictatorial personality abraded many in Congress; he lectured them, he didn't talk to them. His cabinet had few men of first caliber; it was as if he could only work with subordinates. But Edward House knew how to manipulate him (p.22). <br />Wilson declared war as a fight to make the world safe for democracy, an idealistic crusade that overlooks the fact that wars are waged for loot: markets, provinces, colonies, etc.<br />Perhaps Wilson's greatest fault was that everything was handed to him; he didn't have to claw his way to the top by competitive elections (p.27). Page 36 tallies the triumphs of Woodrow Wilson. Perhaps the &quot;errors in judgment&quot; were due to his pride and his refusal to take expert advice (p.37), complicated by his arteriosclerosis or some other disease (&quot;megalomania&quot;?). Wilson gained fame and recognition through his speeches; a rhetorician, not a manager.	2001-11-27

The verdict of acquittal has never stopped interest in this case, or new solutions.<br />The rooms where the bodies lay were in perfect order; doors locked, windows closed.  The victims showed no signs of struggle, their blood had not bespattered the rooms and furniture as it generally does under these circumstances.  The assassin had left absolutely no trace of himself (p.13).  A sudden unforeseen attack that killed with the first blow.  The house had not been robbed, nor was any enemy known of with such hatred as to commit these assassinations.<br />Special officer Philip Harrington questioned Lizzie; suspicions were raised in the minds of the police that she knew more than she cared to tell.  The police and the mayor searched the house from cellar to attic, delved into every nook and corner; every particle of hay in the barn loft and every blade of grass was turned over.  Nothing was found.<br />The autopsy found 13 blows on the head of Mr. Borden, 18 on the skull of Mrs. Borden.  The cuts were deep and long and any one would have produced instant death.  Could any but a madman have struck so ruthlessly and unerringly, time and time again?<br />The Government side presumed that Lizzie would desire to bring the butcher to the gallows (p.76).  It was either him or Lizzie. It was supposed she would answer every question, and volunteer every particle of information in her possession.  She had everything to gain, and nothing to lose.  But the Government must have known that this charge would leave a blotch on her name, and if acquitted, would forever blight her life.  After Lizzie's arrest the Woman's Auxiliary of the YMCA held a prayer for her, the WCTU and religious societies all over the country did the same (p.80).<br />Mr. Jennings describes the murder on page 126.  &quot;There is an unnecessary brutality about this that suggests nothing but insanity or brutalhatred.&quot;  &quot;Every blow showed that the person who wielded that hatchet was a person of experience with the instrument.&quot;  &quot;... no hand could strike these blows that had not a powerful wrist and experience in handling a hatchet.&quot;<br />Regarding the claimed attempt to purchase poison, Jennings says &quot;If there is one thing which is weakest in criminal cases it is the matter of mistaken identity.  The books are full of such references&quot; (p. 130).  Page 195 gives the testimony of Prof. Edward S. Wood; he tested the Bordens' stomachs and found no prussic acid, or other poisonous substances.  He calculated the difference in time of death at about one and a half hours.<br />Page 137 Knowlton discusses Lizzie's changed stories about what she was doing that morning.  He then asks why the sender of the note to Mrs. Borden never came forward, and concludes it never was sent.  Knowlton also claimed the absence of bloodstained clothing is proof of her guilty concealment!  Lizzie was indicted and held for the Grand Jury.  Hilliard and Seaver posted bond for Bridget, ex-Congressman Davis for Mr. Morse (as material witnesses).<br />Chapter XXI tells of the Trickey-McHenry affair that resulted in one of the most famous hoaxes of the time.  False information was given to a reporter, who rushed this scoop into print.  The reporter was then indicted as a result of this plot; he fled the country, and died accidentally.  McHenry had been hired to watch the Pinkerton men, who had been hired by Jennings to watch the police.  McHenry had previous trouble with Trickey's reporting on a trial in Denver, and another case.  McHenry claimed Trickey was reporting to the Pinkertons in Boston.<br />Pages 212-213 quote George D. Robinson as to the killer &quot;a maniac or fiend&quot;, &quot;not a man in his senses ... but a lunatic or a devil&quot;.  &quot;They were well-directed blows.... They were aimed steadily and constantly for a purpose, each one finding its placewhere it was aimed, and none going amiss on the one side of the other.&quot; &quot;The perpetrator of that act knew how to handle the instrument, was experienced in its control, had directed it before or others like it, and it was not the sudden, untrained doing of somebody who had been unfamiliar with such implements.&quot;<br />Pages 266-267 tell how Lizzie shielded Bridget and Andrew's workmen from suspicion (they were checked out anyway).  This left her as the remaining suspect; but she never told!  Page 280 says &quot;there is a skeleton in the household of every man, but the Borden skeleton - if there was one - was fairly well locked up from view.  They were a close-mouthed family.&quot;<br />Pages 304-311 contain part of Justice Dewey's charge to the jury.  Robert Sullivan's &quot;Goodbye, Lizzie Borden&quot; has it all. After an hour the jury returned with its verdict of &quot;Not Guilty&quot;.  &quot;Lizzie Andrew Borden returned guiltless to her friends and home in Fall River.&quot;  <br />Lizzie Borden took a walk,<BR>To let her Dad have his talk;<BR>When she came back to the room,<BR>She found Dear Dad met his doom.	2001-11-26

Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr.<br />Herb MacDonnell teaches a course on bloodstain evidence.  He wields a hatchet, casting off drops of blood in the direction of his thrust and backswing (p.37).  He is the world's leading authority on blood pattern analysis.  He tells his students to save their homework for future reference.  They didn't read about it in a book, this is firsthand knowledge (p.56).<br />Page 62 tells the story of a couple who went wandering into the woods; the girlfriend never returned.  When a hand was found, the boyfriend was indicted and tried for murder.  Fortunately for him, she showed up at the trial with both hands intact!<br />Some people are born with large arteries, which gives an advantage in longevity over people with narrow ones.  This does not correlate with physical height (p.107).  There is no study to see if this size is hereditary, or is the result of chance.<br />Since 90% of what we eat moves out of the stomach in 2 to 3 hours, time of death is estimated from the last meal (p.109).<br />After the Nicole Brown Simpson - Ron Goldman murders were discovered the medical examiner wasn't notified until ten hours later.  By then critical evidence had vanished forever.  Pages 150-153 discuss this topic.  The low-velocity blood droplets on Nicole's back could have come from the killer, but were lost. A medical examiner doesn't know what he is looking for until he finds it.<br />Certain bugs can tell us when and where someone was killed, and they do it with an accuracy that no man-made system will ever reproduce (p.162).  Traffic deaths in NY resulting from people swatting at bees in their cars will disappearin winter and reappear in summer (p.163).<br />Since the late 18th century when Paul Revere identified the body of Dr. Joseph Warren (killed on Bunker Hill), teeth have been used to identify bodies (p.212).  Dental insurance has generated millions of X-rays and a database of identification for forensic odontologists.  Pages 220-225 tell how faces are recreated from skulls, a technique that originated in 1960s Russia.<br />English police are compiling the largest computer database of ear prints, and plan to use them like fingerprints in identification.  This is a modernization of the Bertillon System, which measured specific parts of the body (p.224).  Lip prints are also unique to each individual.<br />Chapter Ten discusses the obverse side of this science.  What if the forensic scientist cheats and lies about the evidence? Fingerprints can be created, a glove and blood evidence planted, etc.  This shows the need for an assigned forensic scientist, like a Public Defender, for the indicted.  Or an independent crime lab that can be trusted by both Prosecution and Defense. &quot;Man prefers to believe what he wants to be true&quot; said Francis Bacon.  &quot;Emotion in numerous, often imperceptible ways pervades and infects our understanding&quot; (p.231).  Forensic scientists, as humans, can be motivated by greed, stress, naivete, ambition, fear, money, or just following orders (&quot;a team player&quot;).  Dr. Baden recommends using medical examiners in all counties of all states, who should all be forensic pathologists (p.235).  This sounds true, but what if the low bidder chosen is like Fred Zain or Ralph Erdmann?  All rules do not ensure equal results.  Bad science can contaminate evidence by creating an assumption of guilt.  The real perpetrator will escape, and prosecution will claim the accused was &quot;let off on a technicality&quot;!  As Randall Dale Adams, who spent twelve years in prison for a murder he didn't commit.  &quot;Forensic Animation&quot; is used to recreate an event for viewing by a jury; but it is only as reliable as its assumptions.  It can be manipulated as easily as any other evidence (p.246).<br />A 1996 DOJ report said DNA evidence excluded 25% of those charged in rape and rape-and-murder cases!  And other crimes do not involce DNA evidence.  Prosecutors conceal evidence of innocence, or present knowingly false evidence, in many cases.<br />This is a very readable and educational book.  The first sentence of the second paragraph on p.167 has a misspelled word.	2001-11-19

Those who died of exposure, injuries, or typhoid after the first day were not counted.<br />The arrival of the canal around 1820s made Johnstown the busiest place in Cambria county.  In the 1850s the Pennsylvania Railroad came through, the Cambria Iron Company began, and the population increased.  There were about 30,000 people in the area before the flood.   Life was simple, pleasures few.  On Sunday people would go walking out to neighboring boroughs.  There were 123 saloons in the greater Johnstown area, as in other steel towns.<br />The Western Reservoir was built in the 1840s, but became generally known as the South Fork dam.  It was to supply extra water for the Main Line canal from Johnstown to Pittsburgh.  By saving the spring floods, water could be released during the dry summers.  The Portage Railroad lifted the canal boats over the Alleghany Mountain to the canal to Philadelphia.<br />The dam was built on successive layers of &quot;puddled&quot; clay.  The outer wall was riprapped with loose rocks, the inner face with stones.  Five cast iron pipes two feet in diameter, set in a stone culvert, released the water to flow to the South Fork and the Little Conemaugh to Johnstown.  Earth dams were used for thousands of years; they work as long as no water spills over the top, or no internal seepage develops.<br />When the dam was completed in 1852, the Pennsylvania Railroad completed the track from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, and the canal business began its decline.  The state offered to sell the canal, the Penna RR bought it for the right of ways.  The neglected dam broke for the first time in 1862.  The repair work<BR>was done by unqualified people; the discharge pipes were blocked up!  Rains in 1879 and 1881 caused damage.<br />Floods were a recurring problem in Johnstownduring the 19th century.  A growing population needed space, trees disappeared from the hills and mountains, the river channels were narrowed for more buildings and bridges.  The forests retain enormous amounts of water in the soil (800 tons per acre), the soil itself, and snow.  Spring thaws and summer thunderstorms would<BR>send torrents down the hills; flooding became worse each year (p.65-66).  But people believed that a dam break would not cause much trouble.<br />In 1880 the manager of the Cambria Iron Works (a competitor of Carnegie) had the dam inspected.  Two problems were found: there was no discharge pipe to reduce water in the dam, and, the previous repair left a leak that cut into the dam.  This advice was rejected, even after their offer to pay for repairs.  The Cambria Iron Works was bigger than any in Pittsburgh before the Civil War (p.61).<br />There were four other changes to the dam that were crucial.  The height of the dam was lowered, reducing the height between the crest and the spillway.  A screen of iron rods were put across the spillway, which would decrease the its capacity when clogged by debris.  The dam sagged in the center so it was lower than at<BR>the ends; the center should have been highest and strongest.  Lastly, the club brought the level of the lake nearly to the top; there was no reserve capacity for a severe storm.<br />On the morning of May 31, 1889 flooding began after heavy rains; it seemed to be worse than the 1887 flood.  A man was sent to South Fork to warn the people that the dam might give way, and to telegraph a warning to Johnstown.  It was not heeded - they heard<BR>that before!  Three warnings were telegraphed down the valley.  By 12:30PM a 50 to 60 foot wide sheet of water started to flow over the dam.  By 2PM the waters had cut a notch in the center of the dam.  The dam seemed to push out all at once, not break, at 3:10PM (p.100).  It took about 40 minutes for the lake to empty, with the force of Niagara at the Falls, flowing at about 40 MPH (p.102).  The rest of the book tells of the flood and the investigations.<br />The picture of Andrew Carnegie makes me wonder if he had been used as the model for &quot;Santa Claus&quot;.  Building and paving hills  and mountains will increase the flood risk, then or now.	2001-11-15

Oswald, at Parkland Hospital. He<BR>had firsthand personal experience with the crime; he saw that JFK was struck twice from the front: once in the neck, and once in the right side of the head. President LBJ called him to ask for a &quot;deathbed confession&quot; from Oswald. Dr. Crenshaw and the other personnel in the emergency room were ordered not to speak about the events, citing the standard medical confidentiality.<br />Charles A. Crenshaw was a surgeon for over thirty years. He watched thousands of trauma victims enter the emergency room. Trauma is the greatest killer of America's youth, and can affect anyone regardless of age, race, sex, occupation, or status. It also has psychological after effects on survivors.<br />When Oliver Stone's &quot;JFK&quot; was filmed in Dallas the doctors were again warned to keep quiet. The hundreds of similar gunshot cases seen by Dr. Crenshaw since 1963 have confirmed his conclusions on JFK's wounds. He finally decided to write his story in November 1990 when his career was over and he no longer feared the &quot;men in suits&quot;. Dr. Crenshaw saw photos of JFK's Bethesda autopsy - it showed a different wound to the back of the head, one that would support a theory of a lone gunman firing from the back. The front of JFK's neck showed a larger and jagged opening than was seen in Dallas (p.111). According to reports, JFK's body was wrapped in a white cloth and placed in a bronze casket in Dallas. At Bethesda the body was in a zippered body bag in a gray casket. This book was written to present his witness to the events.<br />There is one thing that I remember from that time. Right after the assassination the first newspaper reports said JFK was shot from the front. J. Edgar Hoover then said that JFK was shot while the limousine was heading towards the School Book Depository Building. When photos were printed to show that didn't happen, this story was changed. To learn more about this, read &quot;Act of Treason&quot; by Mark North.<br />Could the &quot;alterations&quot; in the wounds between Dallas and Bethesda be explained by use of a &quot;body double&quot;?	2001-11-08

The AAF recruited and trained the world's<BR>largest air force.  Their men had about 360 hours of<BR>flying time before going into combat, three times more<BR>than Germany, even more that other air forces (p.75). <BR>This practice showed up in the results of air combat. <BR>Any man who flew over enemy territory was either an<BR>officer or a sergeant; that was to ensure better<BR>treatment if taken prisoner. Pilot candidates who<BR>washed out were recruited for flight crews. The flight<BR>crews were recruited from all over the country, and<BR>they saw various parts of the country as they traveled<BR>between their stations.  This mingling was reflected<BR>in Hollywood movies.<br />More B-24s were built than any other airplane. <BR>Consolidated Aircraft Company designed the<BR>&quot;Liberator&quot;, and produced it with other companies<BR>(p.22).  After the war ended nearly all were cut up<BR>for scrap.  The B-17 was easier to take-off, fly,<BR>land, and didn't break up or sink if crash-landed at<BR>sea, compared to a B-24.  The B-24 wing had a tendency<BR>to fold and break off when hit by a shell; but it<BR>carried about 50% more bomb load, and could fly<BR>farther and higher than a B-17 (p.80).<br />World War II was the greatest catastrophe in history:<BR>the most people and buildings were destroyed.  This<BR>was caused by airpower, which was developed to escape<BR>the slaughter in the World War I trenches (p.105). <BR>This book tells the history of one B-24 crew.  For one<BR>account about the civilians on the ground read the<BR>story on pages 262-3.<br />Strategic bombing of the armaments industry and oil<BR>production led to shortages for the enemy.  While the<BR>AAF suffered heavy losses, the Luftwaffe losses were<BR>even higher.  The fuel shortages caused the Wehrmacht<BR>to abandon motorized vehicles and revert back to a<BR>horse-drawnarmy.  It also reduced the training time<BR>for pilots, and lowered their effectiveness.  Only<BR>anti-aircraft guns could be relied upon for defense.<br />Pages 247-251 discusses the strategic bombing campaign<BR>issue. Could the time and effort have been better<BR>spent on fighters, ground troops, and the Navy?  Would<BR>it have avoided killing hundreds of thousands of<BR>civilians and destroying historic buildings,<BR>factories, and residences?

He concluded that Stonehenge was a sophisticated astronomical observatory designed to predict eclipses. The positioning of the stones provides a wealth of information, as does the choice of the site itself. If you can see the alignment, general relationship, and the use of these stones then you will know the reason for the construction. The author, and other astronomers, discovered the 56-year cycle of eclipses by decoding Stonehenge!<br />Stonehenge was constructed from about 1900BC to 1600BC. Appendix B tells how the movement of stones once each year from an initial fixed position will predict accurately every important lunar event for hundreds of years. This computer would need resetting about once every 300 years by advancing the stones by one space. Mankind generally used the cycle of the moon as a unit of timekeeping.<br />The most significant Stonehenge positions line up to point to some unique sun of moon position (Figure 12). Chapter 7 tell how they used an IBM 704 computer in 1961 to plot the Stonehenge positions (120 pairs of points) and calculated where the lines would hit the sky (p.105). Chapter 9 asks if the Aubrey holes can be proved to have been used as a computer? No, but it is the most reasonable solution proposed so far.<br />This entertaining and educational book tells about the author's investigations and conclusions. It is a classic science book for the general reader.	2001-10-25

By August 1994 somebody knew Fuhrman planted the glove (see Steven Singular's &quot;Legacy of Deception&quot;). The 'LA Times' reported on June 7, 1996 that Vannatter collected blood from the victims before the evidence was turned over for analysis.<br />Marcia Clark previously prosecuted twenty murder trials winning all but one (p.2). Teresa Carpenter made this a very readable book. <br />Page 62 says the killer had been in a frenzy to kill Ron Goldman, but killed Nicole swiftly and efficiently. Doesn't this suggest Ron was the target, and Nicole was an innocent bystander? On page 76 she quotes Keith Z. as to stalking by OJ; since they had appeared in public, couldn't someone have tipped off OJ with the news? Didn't Ron Goldman resemble Keith Z. enough to be mistaken for him in the dark? Did this cause Keith Z. to go into hiding for many months afterwards?<br />Page 105 says Nicole's bed had blankets and sheets in a rumpled heap. Would Nicole leave it like that from Saturday night? If not, does this suggest that something else happened? Page 123 says &quot;the FBI found a single Caucasian hair on the glove from Rockingham&quot;. It could not be traced to the victims, or the police officers there. Whose glove was it then?<br />Page 144 discusses asking for the death penalty: &quot;it would have been immoral to seek his death&quot;. <br />Pages 240-1 tell of the strategy to use domestic violence. &quot;One, to strip the jury of their illusions about the defendant; two, to give us the opportunity to present a compelling motive for murder&quot;. In other words, if you can demonize the defendant, then it'll be easier to convict him. Note that there is no question of actual guilt here. Page 242 claims Paula Barbieri left a &quot;Dear John&quot; message for OJ that fatal Sunday. But other books say she visited OJ in jail regularly.<br />Marcia speaks highly of Allan Park, the limousine driver. He arrived at 10:22, but saw nobody until 10:53 (p.369). He left for the airport after 11PM. His testimony convinced the jury to vote &quot;not guilty&quot;.<br />On page 396 she talks about the odds for a match on DNA, &quot;one in 57 billion&quot;. Doesn't she know that these figures are made-up and have no scientific basis? Read &quot;Tainted Evidence&quot; for the details.<br />Pages 405-8 tell of the attempt to have OJ try on the killer's gloves.  Later, a new pair of gloves were produced, they fit perfectly. New gloves fit snugly, but after wearing they develop a looser fit. Here new gloves fit easily, but older worn gloves are too tight? Something's wrong here!<br />Page 411 tells of the Silga sole that was sold to Bruno Magli (and other shoe manufacturers). No one could locate any store, salesman, witness, or receipt that would show OJ bought a pair of Bruno Magli shoes.<br />On page 413 she says you &quot;can see the similarities between the defendant's head hair, for example, and what the killer left behind&quot;. Similar-looking hair is NOT proof they're the same. Read the book &quot;Tainted Evidence&quot; for more details.<br />Pages 437-441 describe what happened when the Fuhrman tapes surfaces, like a 'deus ex machina'.

The author pieced together this story from a variety of sources; he had been a diplomatic correspondent and foreign editor.<br />Th Potsdam Treaty carved up the world just like the Versailles Treaty after an earlier war. But unlike the latter, a new Cold War began (p.19). America shed its traditional isolationism and began its long march towards a New World Order - to replace and surpass the now declining British Empire.<br />The death and destruction in Eastern Europe fixated their leader's minds on security from another war. Their leaders were composed of two dissimilar type: those who spent years in underground activities (Tito), and those beholden to Moscow. It also included adventurers who joined the winning side, those with experience from the pre-war regimes, and some double agents.<br />Jan Masaryk said that Czechoslovakia's votes with Poland and Yugoslavia had not harmed the United States but benefitted Czechoslovakia by preventing Soviet interference there (p.26). But the Soviets demanded political support in return for noninterference in internal affairs, and America demanded political support in exchange for aid. Can a servant serve two masters?<br />Page 30 makes two mistakes in talking about disbanding the OSS by Truman, and a decoding organization by Stimson. The former was due to bureaucratic struggles within government, the latter to drop a high-cost unofficial group. You can be sure the regular agencies continued with this work!<br />Page 37 tells of the activities of &quot;Michael Sullivan&quot;, the head of a British relief agency who set up a spy network in Poland. Prisoners were extracted, incidents of sabotage and terrorism were created, rumors of shortages created runs on shops, rural riots were created by rumors of collectivization. In 1945 agents incited anti-semitic riots in Kielce and Krakow. The purpose of all this was to create a revolution; it failed. But he recruited the deputy director of Department Ten (Jozef Swiatlo), whose function was to police the policemen of the police state; it had unlimited powers.<br />The devil in all these details was Allen Welsh Dulles, grandson and nephew of Secretaries of State, senior partner of the law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, and head of the OSS mission in Berne during World War II. From 1946 to 1948 Allen Dulles ran private intelligence operations in Eastern Europe, using funds from companies and the wealthy (page 53 does not list their special interests). Like his brother John he was involved with a number of religious and charitable institutions which were used to cover and conceal their secret activities.<br />Dulles chose to use Noel Field as a pawn to taint national Communists as US spies, ensuring their destruction by Stalin. Dulles would use Swiatlo to help incriminate many with planted evidence (p.99). Evidence would show that Field recruited Communists as American agents, that others were followers of Tito or Trotsky. Stalin checked out these stories with their double agent in Washington - it was verified. But their double agent was a triple agent! Recruited in the 1930s, he was being saved for an event like this (p.101). To complete the deception, Dulles &quot;leaked&quot; the news that the CIA had agents in the Communist governments of Eastern Europe. The result was widespread investigations, purges, imprisonment, and executions. Years later the victims would be &quot;posthumously rehabilitated&quot;.<br />Didn't DeTocqueville once say that a regime is likely to be overthrown once it begins to liberalize its rule?<br />&quot;The Spy Who Came in From the Cold&quot; was a fictional story based upon this real incident. They made it appear that an important Eastern government official was a spy for the West in order to get him purged, and his rival promoted; but the rival was the real spy!	2001-10-19

The Ingalls family left their homestead in wooded Wisconsin to travel to the grassy prairies of the new lands out west. Their grandparents, aunt, uncles, and cousins all came to say goodbye; they might never see them again.<br />This book will give you an idea of what it was like to live and travel in the 1870s. Before airplanes, automobiles, even trains; before television, radio, electricity, and indoor plumbing. No maps or roadsigns either. What was it like to cross a creek in those days? What was it like to build your own house? How did people eat without a butcher, baker, or grocery store? Where did they get furniture? They settled on the prairie, far away from the woods. For Christmas, Mary and Laura got their very own tin cups; how happy they were! But then things changed in the spring - they had to move away to a new land again.<br />The illustrations usually show the people without hats or sunbonnets, historically inaccurate.	2001-10-18

By August 1994 somebody knew who planted the glove (see Steven Singular's &quot;Legacy of Deception&quot;). The 'LA Times' reported on June 7, 1996 that Vannatter collected blood from the victims before the evidence was turned over for analysis.<br />Marcia Clark previously prosecuted twenty murder trials winning all but one (p.2). Teresa Carpenter made this a very readable book. Page 3 says there &quot;was enough physical evidence to convict O.J. twenty times times over&quot;. Does this mean it was too good to be true?<br />Page 62 says the killer had been in a frenzy to kill Ron Goldman, but killed Nicole swiftly and efficiently. Doesn't this suggest Ron was the target, and Nicole was an innocent bystander? On page 76 she quotes Keith Z. as to stalking by OJ; since they had appeared in public, couldn't someone have tipped off OJ with the news? Didn't Ron Goldman resemble Keith Z. enough to be mistaken for him in the dark? Did this cause Keith Z. to go into hiding for many months afterwards?<br />Page 105 says Nicole's be had blankets and sheets in a rumpled heap. Would Nicole leave it like that from Saturday night? If not, does this suggest that something else happened? Page 123 says &quot;the FBI found a single Caucasian hair on the glove from Rockingham&quot;. It could not be traced to the victims, or the police officers there. Whose glove was it then?<br />Page 144 discusses asking for the death penalty: &quot;it would have been immoral to seek his death&quot;. Because of his innocence?<br />Pages 157-9 and 163-7 tell of her youthful experiences, and her first marriage; a husband who &quot;displayed&quot; physical aggression. Page 205 tells of Faye Resnick's book, which told of beatings and abuse of Nicole. But these had never come to the attention of the DA's investigators! Faye made other statements which could not be corroborated.<br/>Page 228 says Nicole's family needed OJ's financial support, and discouraged Nicole from leaving OJ! I don't remember the media reporting this. Page 230 says Fred Goldman would check with Marcia before talking to Geraldo. Didn't Joe Bosco write that Fred was sent to the press as a diversion? She also says &quot;the Goldmans and the Browns were simply beyond out control&quot;?<br />Pages 240-1 tell of the strategy to use domestic violence. &quot;One, to strip the jury of their illusions about the defendant; two, to give us the opportunity to present a compelling motive for murder&quot;. In other words, if you can demonize the defendant, then it'll be easier to convict him. Note that there is no mention of actual guilt here. Page 242 claims Paula Barbieri left a &quot;Dear John&quot; message for OJ that fatal Sunday. But other books say she visited OJ in jail regularly.<br />On page 308 she criticizes Tom Lange for appearing &quot;cool and unbiased&quot;. Did she want him angry and emotional? On pages 334-7 she discusses the Fuhrman problem. But Marcia does not tell what was causing the problem between Chris and Mark. Or why Chris refused to deal with Mark.<br />Marcia speaks highly of Allan Park, the limousine driver. He arrived at 10:22, but saw nobody until 10:53 (p.369). He left for the airport after 11PM. His testimony convinced the jury to vote &quot;not guilty&quot;.<br />On page 396 she talks about the odds for a match on DNA, &quot;one in 57 billion&quot;. Doesn't she know that these figures are made-up and have no scientific basis?<br />Pages 405-8 tell of the attempt to have OJ try on the killer's gloves. If they don't fit, you must explain it. Later, a new pair of gloves were produced, they fit perfectly. New gloves fit snugly, but after wearing they develop a looser fit. Here new gloves fit easily, but older worn gloves tighten up? Something's wrong here!<br />Page 411 tells of the Silga sole that was sold to Bruno Magli (and other shoe manufacturers).You can visit a store and see if each style has a different sole. Marcia wonders where all those photographs were during her trial. Perhaps they were waiting for photo-editing software that would run on a 486 (see &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; for December 1997). No one could locate any store, salesman, witness, or receipt that would show OJ bought a pair of Bruno Magli shoes.<br />Marcia says OJ is the guy &quot;who wears cashmere-lined gloves&quot;. Don't they cost the same as fur-lined gloves? On page 413 she says you &quot;can see the similarities between the defendant's head hair, for example, and what the killer left behind&quot;. Similar-looking hair is NOT proof they're the same. Read the book &quot;Tainting Evidence&quot; for more details.<br />Pages 437-441 describe what happened when the Fuhrman tapes surfaces, like a deus ex machina.<br />Page 451 tells of Fuhrman's testimony: to be convicted of perjury, the lie had to be material to the case. If he lied about racial slurs, it was not material to the murders. But if he planted evidence, then he had the right against self-incrimination.

CBS	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Elementary School Teacher Flunks General	A school teacher received a summons to jury service. Did CBS' &quot;Sixty Minutes&quot; libel General Westmoreland by saying he altered reports to present a more favorable political picture? The author tells of her experience as a juror, from initial summons to final verdict. The book has no index.<br />The &quot;Introduction&quot; (pp. 11-12) concisely tells the simple facts behind the case. It does NOT tell who was behind the &quot;Capital Legal Foundation&quot; and put up the millions of dollars for this unnecessary trial.<br />Page 131 gives an example of the problem. The defense lawyer would ask General Westmoreland if he made certain statements. The General would vehemently deny doing so. Then the lawyer would bring up several documents proving that the General had indeed said so.<br />Page 191 has a deposition: they &quot;deliberately manipulated the figures of enemy strength to misguide the public, the press, and Congress. The documents they supplied were irrefutable proof that there was a conspiracy ... no one knew how high the conspiracy went.&quot;<br />Page 195 tells of Richard McArthur: when he complained about the changes to his figures he was transferred out to the field!<br />A number of witnesses said Westmoreland had a ceiling on enemy figures, no matter what the facts were (&quot;One Little Lie&quot;). The trial ended when Westmoreland dropped his charges.<br />Page 153 tells how the documentaries are staged. They record the subject with all questions and answers. Then they record the interviewer asking questions that have been answered previously. The questioner can change the tone and questions for the desired effect.	2001-10-09

It is about people, justice, the law, and truth as a jury sees it. The jury decides the facts in the case, as presented by the prosecutor and defense attorney.<br />Chapter 2 tells of his attempt to avoid jury duty: bring along a copy of &quot;The NY Review of Books&quot;; it didn't work. The Senior Court Clerk asked &quot;anybody not understand English?&quot;, and those who understood this question were released from jury service! Page 27 tells of the standard of proof: reasonable doubt. As a student of intellectual history he knows how variable was its definition over the ages. But his knowledge seems to come from books, as on page 30 &quot;soy tan macho ...&quot;.<br />Chapter 3 starts by questioning the evolution of the justice system into a jury, judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney. What would he say about the alternative: one person as judge, jury, and executioner? The police searched for the attacker among patients treated by hospitals. &quot;It is hard to stab someone many times, in haste and agitation, and avoid a slip or two&quot; (p.38). The police found a suspicious case, searched for the bloodstained clothes, and find the evidence to make an arrest.<br />In Chapter 4 (p.70) he says &quot;defendants in murder trials seldom take the stand&quot;. In early 19th Century England they were NOT allowed to speak at all. He also wonders about withholding the prior history of the defendant. This is to prevent prejudice by lazy jurors, and insure they only consider the facts in this case.<br />After the defendant testified, the prosecutor cross-examined him in a badgering and belligerent manner. The defendant answered calmly. The author &quot;felt a deep desire to see the prosecutor lose the case&quot; (p.73). No motive was proven, so the claim of self-defense seemed reasonable. They didn't believe the prosecutor's theory.<br />The unexplained mystery is why this slight book of little importance was published. Read &quot;The Juror and the General&quot;, or &quot;The Private Diary of an O.J. Juror&quot; for more important (and educational) cases.	2001-10-04

This NOVEL uses fictional characters to tell the reader what life was like in 1830s Texas.

Yallop wrote four previous works (one caused the British government to reopen a twenty-year old murder case, another freed a man serving a life sentence for murder).  This investigates the mysterious death of Albino Luciani, Pope John Paul I.  He spent three years of intensive investigation using various sources in Rome, New York, London, and South America; they cannot be publicly identified.<br />Luciano Albini opposed the looting of Banco Ambrosiano while Bishop of Venice.  As Pope he would rid the Vatican Bank of swindlers, money launderers, drug dealers, and their allies.  But these had connections with organized crime and certain intelligence agencies.  Pope John Paul I was as doomed as President John F. Kennedy's attempts to curtail the military-industrial complex, and Big Oil.<br />In 1981 there was an attempt to poison the Foreign Minister of El Salvador: the poison was to be put into his alcoholic drink.  Nothing would happen for a week, then he would develop a flu-like disease, and die the next day.  This poison could not be detected unless the coroner knew what to look for.  This plot was exposed by the double agent recruited for the job, and a US diplomat was expelled from the country.  The newspapers did NOT compare this to the death of Pope John Paul I.<br />Pages 40-49 tell of a swindle using counterfeit bonds worth $635 million.  They would be sold to the Vatican Bank, and the money used for payoffs, and buying control of a company.  The bank would write this off as a loss.  You can be sure of high-level corruption and collusion in the bank!<br />The murder of Pope John Paul I may never be solved officially.  Perhaps another Pope would continue his proposed reforms; we'll see in the near future.	2001-09-07

If you liked &quot;Quincy ME&quot; or &quot;CSI&quot; you'll love reading true stories about his pioneering work in the first half of the 20th century.  He is an outstanding writer as well.  This book shows how legal medicine can convict the guilty and exonerate the innocent.  Most of these cases deal with murder, and tell how the doctor let the dead bones speak to the living.<br />Erle Stanley Gardner says a successful practitioner of forensic medicine must not only be outstanding in his field, but most be quick-thinking and keen of mind: a real version of Sherlock Holmes.  A good medical expert should search for the truth, not the facts to support a pre-conceived theory; this usually results in a miscarriage of justice; chapter 20 illustrates this.<br />Page 90 tells of his analysis of the British .303 cartridge.  The bullet had an &quot;aluminium tip enclosed in a strong cupro-nickel jacket&quot;.  This tip often broke off when the bullet entered a body.  This could result in a blunt-edged bullet that could tumble in a body and create more damage; in effect, a dum-dum bullet.<br />On page 152 he says that in the British legal system, expert witnesses are made available to the defendants, and paid when the defendant is without means.  This is an improvement over just providing a public defender.  &quot;While the life of a scoundrel may not be worth saving, the principles of justice always are.&quot;<br />Sir Sydney Smith writes with a dry, subtle sense of humor, and with understatements.  This book cannot be easily summarized, except to say: get it and read it!	2001-08-31

But Ned Beaumont (nee Schoenberg?) gets fixed up as a special investigator to look into the murder of the Senator's son. Ned tracks down the bookmaker who welshed and skipped town, and uses &quot;the hat trick&quot; to claim his winnings; money is power. Afterwards he acts like a private detective as well as a political crony. Disagreeing with Paul Madvig, he meets Shad O'Rory; Shad tries bribery and torture to get Ned to betray his friend Paul. Ned escapes this trap, and helps to solve the murder of an eye-witness. In telling this, the book shows how a newspaper can slant the news: &quot;they wouldn't print it if it wasn't true&quot;!<BR>This novel seems to be a variation on Hammett's detective stories, using &quot;politics&quot; as the &quot;root of evil&quot;. But there is a relationship between political power and the love of money. This book shows government functioning as a feudal system: a ruler accepts loyalty from his subjects, and in turn helps and supports them. But the ruler may accept an election loss if that will punish disloyalty and keep his personal power. Could a blue-blooded aristocratic politician sacrifice his son, pimp his daughter, and attempt murder to keep political power? You can judge how this novel approximates the real world.

They then gained control of the town, going from servants to masters; but no one gang gained control. The company owner then used his newspaper to try to advocate a &quot;civic reform&quot; campaign to regain control. His newspaper publisher son hired the Continental Op, but was killed before they meet. (Was this similar to Robert F. Kennedy's prosecution of organized crime?) Machiavelli's Letter to the Prince of Florence (p.9) tells of the problems with a mercenary army: they can takeover the government that hired them. Only a citizen army is proper to a republic. Creating a militia by arming the cirtizens of &quot;Personville&quot; could have put an end to these gangs, but the political control of &quot;Elihu Willsson&quot; would have ended as well. The 1877 strike in Pittsburgh's coal and iron industry led to the abolishment of the traditional local militia and its replacement by a state-controlled militia. Newly powerful corporations now controlled the state government, and the new &quot;National Guard&quot; developed into a strike-breaking force with the power of law. The Continental Op purges &quot;Personville&quot; and leaves, but the book doesn't tell how quickly new gangs re-appear. The corporate control continues, with its need for strike-breaking gunmen; they pop up like teeth in a shark. Corporate control of politicians and government may only be possible with this corruption. The politics of this novel guarantees that it will never be faithfully filmed by Hollywood, unlike some of his other novels. But this made it a best sell in 1929 and afterwards.	2001-08-27

It then discusses the parable of &quot;Flitcraft&quot;, a story that may mock the philosophy of Charles S. Pierce. The editor notes Hammett's notion of organized criminals running society; is this only an exaggeration of Corporate America in the early 20th century? Do these events only happen in fiction?<br />The editor claims Hammett's creative career ended when he could not handle the contradictions of his work. Wasn't it due to his drinking, partying, and womanizing that kept him away from writing? Could his fame have prevented him from renewed contacts with Agency detectives and their stories?

He followed leads, found answers to questions, and interviewed anyone who claimed to have known Dash. SDH worked at different jobs before joining Pinkerton as a detective. He joined the Army in 1917, and contracted a lung disease and TB during the 1918 Flue Pandemic. His disability pension wasn't enough for his family; he studied at a Business College and started to work in advertising. He then began to write for publication. In spite of his lung disease he smoked and he drank.<br />SDH began to gain success by 1923 with his short stories; he was too sick for any other work. His advertising job ended when he collapsed with bleeding lungs; he also had hepatitis. He renewed his literary efforts, and success followed. He then wrote longer novels, and gained more wealth and fame. He left his family and moved to New York's literary milieu. He indulged in liquor, women, money, and fame; he was &quot;Nick Charles&quot;, not &quot;Sam Spade&quot;. Drinking handicapped his Hollywood career, and flushed away his talents. Recycling his writings on radio during the 1940s earned him money; this ended after his refusal to testify in 1951. The next ten years were spent in poverty.

He says a police chief isn't doing his job unless the police union complains (p.235), but the chief must depend on the support of the mayor and an aroused citizenry.<br />After a new mayor ended his job as police chief, Tony Bouza was given a job as President of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence Inc. (p.186). His comments on the 'TODAY' show (President Bush can see homeless people across the street) led to his firing the next day. But no one had complained! Could CPHV Inc. be indirectly funded by Federal subsidies? If not, who really controls it?<br />The author mentions the shooting (but not the attempted bombing) at Columbine high school. These tragedies have led to garrison schools, guarded by cops and security devices, leading to a climate of paranoia and public hysteria (p.243). But the reality is that schools are the safest havens, and the home the most dangerous! Most violence occurs from people we know. (The author doesn't ask if there is a hidden agenda in publicizing these rare occurrences.) Violence often results &quot;from drugs, alcohol, disordered homes, and mental illness&quot; he says' but he disregards the economic factors behind them. He claims (p.245) that in an unarmed society criminals lack access to firearms but can cite no examples!<br />On page 250 he notes the widening chasms between rich and poor, but seems to not understand the politics of this. Perhaps our &quot;overclass&quot; want to turn America into a banana republic where a tiny percentage live in fabulous wealth and luxury, and the many live in poverty? He talks about the &quot;enormous building boom&quot; in prisons in the 1990s and wonders what will happen in the future. But isn't the prison boom the obverse of the reduction in public housing and welfare? Or an example of forced relocation of the &quot;underclass&quot;?<br />Chapter 20 &quot;Issues Across the Landscape&quot; summarizes his viewpoints. He questions the policy of mandatory sentences for non-violent crimes, since they fill up prisons and result in the release of violent criminals. He also questions the policy of releasing the mentally ill while hoping they will take their daily medicine. He recommends combatting crime with stakeouts, decoy operations, stings, and infiltration. Aren't these labor and capital intensive operations that may not work in small towns? He says the underlaying causes of crime are poverty and racism, which remain largely untouched by the rulers of society; it will continue.<br />The author's early years with the &quot;Red Squad&quot; must have given him the connections needed for his success, but little is said about it.	2001-08-01

This book recreates the life and times at the Jersey Shore during that fateful summer of 1916. The scientists of that era did not believe the legends of man-eating sharks in temperate waters; it was just a &quot;fisherman's tale&quot;. The new fasion of ocean bathing drew thousands to the hotels along the shore. The fresh sea air allowed people to escape their smoky, humid cities where horse-drawn wagons still predominated. The author did a great amount of research into the facts, as in the history of the Vansant family.<br />The offshore waters were teeming with fish; when caught and cleaned the offal was discarded offshore. This fed and drew predators to the beaches, where people were in the waters. The very high tides of a full moon correspond to increased shark attacks. Swimming with a dog also increases the chances of a shark attack. In July 1916 people found out that shark attacks were more than &quot;fisherman's tales&quot;. After the Beach Haven attack the officials there sent out no warnings - to protect the tourist trade! Thousands of tourists and their dollars were at stake (this was one facet of reality in the movie &quot;Jaws&quot;). This concern ended up at the Wilson White House.	2001-07-25

The author says a profound shift in power occurred in politics, economics, and culture. But the preceding years 1953 to 1968 also recorded many changes in the country in politics, economics, and culture. It seems arbitrary to pick &quot;the seventies&quot; and avoid the earlier times that led to it. The book provides an entertaining review of these years.<br />One interesting part is the section dealing with the tax revolt in California (Proposition 13) and Massachusetts (Proposition 2 1/2). The devaluation of the dollar by Nixon (&quot;monetarizing the debt&quot;) led to double-digit rises in prices. Fixed income tax rates led to higher taxes for most people. Proposition 13 limited the tax rate to 1% of market value; this reduced California property taxes from 58% above the national average. Proposition 2 1/2 capped property taxes at 2.5% of the fair market value, and limited increases to 2.5% a year. Neither mentioned the sales and income taxes, whose amount rises with increased prices and wages. There was no consideration of a depression, where sales and wages fall.<br />To keep property taxes low and stable, the county must get a share of the sales tax, and the municipality or township must get part of the income tax of the residents. This allows increased costs to be met by increases in the sales and income taxes. There is a limit on cutting and controlling spending by any county or municipality, since they can't control prices. You can consider why the other options won't work as well.	2001-07-23

Simpson	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Take His Class or Read This Book	This book reviews some famous crimes of the twentieth century. It suggests: the same forensic errors from the past are still being made today; public opinion can influence the outcome of criminal cases; human error or misconduct can degrade criminal investigations; modern technology might have solved past cases.<br />Section 1 deals with the Sacco-Vanzetti case. He points out discrepancies in the Plymouth trial of Vanzetti. He tells of the $50,000 bribery attempt. He says some witness swore Sacco drove, others Vanzetti; but neither owned a car or knew how to drive (p.62). The gate tender said Vanzetti spoke in clear English; but Vanzetti's English was accented!<br />The author points to a problem in tracing the chain of custody for the fatal bullets and shells (p.78-81). The fatal bullet had a different twist from the other three, although all were supposed to have come from the same gun! Pages 82-85 tell how testimony was elicited to obscure this fact. Pages 90-91 tell that Vanzetti's revolver (#G-825810 was not taken from the slain guard (#394717). This infers gross misconduct from the presiding judge and others. He suggest the fingerprints taken from the car used in the crime did not match Sacco or Vanzetti.<br />Section 2 deals with five other cases: Lindbergh, Dr. Sam Sheppard, JFK, Vincent Foster, and Jon Benet Ramsay. On the Lindbergh kidnapping, document examiners concluded that Hauptmann did NOT write the ransom notes (p.118). There was the curious incident of the dog in the night - it did nothing! Initially, time sheets showed Hauptmann worked in NY city until 5PM (p.127).<br />Section 3 deals with the trial of O.J.Simpson. Page 204 says white towels were used to soak up the blood after the murders - the blood had not dried. Page 205 tells of finding unmelted ice cream, which can measure the passage of time. Page 219 quotes deputy coroner Dr. Irwin Golden: &quot;75 percent of the forensic criteria would set the time after 11PM&quot;. To believe OJ guilty you must believe that he was able to dispose of the bloody clothes, shoes, and knives so they would never be found, yet take the socks and glove back to his house!<br />The flesh and blood under Nicole's fingernails, and the bruised fists of Ron could have helped identify the murderer. Someone who had scratches and bruises on his face, or disappeared the next day for weeks (until the wounds healed). He may have then returned with a beard to cover any scars.	2001-07-23

Gambling means wagering money on events which are beyond your control. (But sometimes the events can be controlled!) Gambling can encourage a reckless disregard for two precious commodities: time and money. As often as there is gambling, there are ways to fix the results. &quot;Don't bet on anything that talks&quot; is what some gamblers say. But the house figures the odds so they have the advantage.<br />It is commonly believed that compulsive gamblers have an unconscious desire to lose. They also tend to be tense, irritable, suffer from insomnia, and think of suicide. They come from all levels of society and have many different backgrounds, but the overwhelming majority are men. Knowing that the odds are against them rarely stops people from gambling. Compulsive gamblers are a danger to themselves and to society.	2001-07-20

Books	1	6	11	N	N	Attempting to Revise History	The author is a professor of history who has written about four murder cases as a &quot;scholarly inquiry&quot;.  He claims the verdicts in all four cases were wrong!  The author is wrong about Lizzie and OJ; the jury verdicts were correct.<br />Page 24 does not mention the other suspects: Brayton, Carpenter, etc.  Page 41 quotes Lizzie as saying &quot;she heard her (Abby) come in&quot;, but misdirects the reader to think of the guest bedroom.  But if Abby did come in she would take the back stairs to her room, not the front stairs to the girls' rooms; Andrew did just that.  Page 42 repeats the lie about the &quot;broken handle&quot; of the hatchet; it was sawn off!  Page 44 quotes Fleet as to a cursory search; in fact they searched the house &quot;down to a bump in the wallpaper&quot;.  Page 47 tells that the new hatchet did not fit the wounds, but doesn't tell about the shred of gilt paint found.  Page 48 quotes two boys as saying the barn was &quot;nice and cool&quot;; perhaps lightly dressed boys had a different experience from adults?<br />The author claims Lizzie was &quot;guilty beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; (p.56) but can give no proof.  Only Bridget and Lizzie were known to be present from 9AM to after 11AM. Bridget was seen outside around 9:30 when Abby was killed; Lizzie was seen outside at 11AM when Andrew was killed. If one person killed them both then neither Bridget or Lizzie did it. No bloodstains on dresses, no murder weapon found. Lizzie said &quot;it wasn't Bridget or anyone who worked for Father&quot;; the jury said it wasn't Lizzie. The author knows Bridget was ordered to wash the windows that morning (p.57) but doesn't know its significance. Page 59 mentions that the testimony about an attempted poison purchase was barred; could it be that they knew it wasn't Lizzie? It is dishonest to say Arnold R. Brown &quot;insists that (WSB) dropped into the Second Street home to murder the Bordens&quot; (p.265). Hixson should have read David Kent's &quot;Forty Whacks&quot;.<br />The last murder case seems to be the reason for this book. It is an attempt to rewrite the historical facts on the trial of OJ Simpson.<br />Page 207 tells why a preliminary hearing was used rather than a grand jury. This put all the witnesses on the record just after the murders, and prevented the prosecution from concocting a story months later. It was not a mistake to hold the case in downtown LA where the facilities were superior, and closer to the command post. Page 210 tells of &quot;TIME&quot; magazine's darkened mug shot of OJ, but does not realize this was done to hide the fact that OJ had no scratches or bruises on his face! Page 214 does NOT mention that Johnnie Cochran Jr. was an Assistant DA in the 60s, and the #3 DA in the late 70s; why? Page 215 says &quot;media coverage ... had now become more favorable to the defense&quot;; how was that measured? One page 219 he talks about DNA tests, but doesn't say the flesh and blood found under Nicole's fingernails did not match the blood type and DNA of OJ Simpson, Ron Goldman, or Nicole herself! Page 229 says the limousine driver saw no white Bronco when he came to pick up OJ, but claims he saw the Bronco obstructing his view when he left; is the author inventing facts? The truth is that rehearing the limo driver's testimony convinced the jury to acquit. Page 233 says &quot;brown leather gloves&quot; but the crime scene photos show black leather gloves (with Caucasian limb hair!).<br />Why is OJ Simpson innocent of the murders? When the police arrived at 12:15AM they found two bodies whose red blood was trickling down the sidewalk. The photos taken showed this red blood. This means the murders occurred after 11:30PM, because the blood would be black and clotted if they were dead for over an hour. Since the limo driver left for the airport with OJ at 11PM, he could not have been present at the murders. In 1999 Herb MacDonnell said this in a newspaper interview, and discussed other facts in this case. Perhaps the author should show more regard for these facts?	2001-07-16

He has a doctorate in political science. This book tells how the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign helped to delay the release of 52 American hostages in Iran until after the election, and made illegal arms shipments. It tells how the national security complex of the government kept William Casey informed of highly classified military movements, diplomatic initiatives, and policy decisions. It tells of the connection to the Iran-Contra Affair.<br />Page 109 tells of the investigation into the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103; there were many suspicious characters on that single transatlantic flight, apparently quite by chance. There was a hidden layer below the surface of events that is still unknown, due to the many dubious or dangerous passengers!<br />The fundamental question is: did William Casey travel to Paris during October 15-20 1980 and meet with Iranian representatives to arrange a delayed release of the American hostages in return for promises of military equipment? The answer is yes! The Carter administration's negotiations with Iran collapsed, even though the Iranians had shown great interest in obtaining military equipment from the US (pp.155-7). It was not due to Khomeinin's unremitting hatred of Jimmy Carter, but to a better offer. A group of private citizens entered into diplomatic negotiations with a hostile foreign power to undercut their own government in a ruthless quest for political power (p.175).<br />Why was the Reagan-Bush campaign afraid of an early release for the hostages held in Iran (p.168)? Perhaps they did background polling and learned this would increase Carter's votes. The October polls showed the candidates in &quot;a dead heat&quot;. If the hostages were released, Carter would get a 10% boost (p.170). President Carter's briefing book, with his answers to questions, was stolen and handed to the Reagan-Bush campaign; this allowed them to prepare their responses. The Republican disinformation campaign also predicted an imminent hostage release (p.173) just before the election. This would create a disappointment.<br />Page 214 discusses the policy on &quot;contract employees&quot;. They recruit those who have the needed skills, and a propensity for exaggeration. After a couple of assignments, the contractor is arrested. This, with his boasting, ensures his record will discredit his testimony.<br />Barbara Honegger's book was published first and is longer. I found it to be more readable and better organized. One chapter lists the fates of those involved in the deal.	2001-07-12

Nicolo Machiavelli came from an old but impoverished family, yet was named Second Chancellor, and Secretary to the Council of Ten for War at age 29. He was commissioned to undertake diplomatic missions to many countries, which influenced his belief in political pragmatism. His travels thru Switzerland inspired his famous remark &quot;only those countries where the people are well-armed are free from foreign or domestic tyranny&quot;. The Gonfalonier of Florence insisted on a policy of neutrality, and the peace treaty with Louis XII. After the French army was driven out, the Holy League invaded Florence and restored the Medici as rulers. Perhaps this showed that a treaty between states should only be kept when it is in their interest to do so? Machiavelli was now out of a job; he retired to a small village and wrote his political, historical, and literary works. Just as many out-of-office politicians also do.<br />Books offering advice to rulers were common in Medieval and Renaissance times; self-help books are still best sellers today. Machiavelli said it is better for a ruler to be feared than loved, but never be hated. His book, unlike Erasmus' &quot;The Education of a Christian Prince&quot;, was kept by the bed of Charles V.<br />Should the moral laws that apply to ordinary people also apply to the ruler of a sovereign state? The history of our Presidents suggest what that answer is. &quot;Watch what we do, not what we say&quot; was not from a 16th century ruler! By describing how rulers acted, Machiavelli produced a warning so their subjects would not be taken in by their promises; &quot;don't get fooled again&quot;.	2001-07-05

Kennedy Assassination: New Revelations on the Conspiracy and Cover-Up, 1968-1991	Books	5	34	34	N	N	An Expose of the Cover-Up of the Conspiracy	Philip H. Melanson is a professor of political science and a specialist in the study of political violence. This book is an authoritative expose of brazen official manipulation of the legal process used to cover-up the conspiracy to kill RFK. The numerous glaring and unanswered questions in this case, with the simplistic official solution, caused the author to research for additional unexamined evidence. He spent many years investigating the facts, interviewed dozens of witnesses, law enforcement officials and other sources, and analyzed hundreds of LAPD and FBI files released by 1991.<br />Philip H. Melanson provides evidence that Sirhan did not act alone, and, the official investigation authorities (LAPD, FBI) covered up evidence that suggested conspiracy (p.4). He was the first author to have access to most of the existing LAPD files on the case. He and his team found that the LAPD had altered, suppressed, and destroyed vital evidence in the case (p.6).<br />The investigation assumed a &quot;lone gunman&quot; immediately. The trial was only concerned with Sirhan's state of mind (pp.24-25). The number of shots fired, the bullets matched to the wrong gun, were all skipped over. The LAPD's conclusions, its methods and its competence were not tested in an adversarial proceeding. The tapes of Sirhan's interrogations were never released to the defense. The profound discrepancies and conflicts in the evidence were suppressed or ignored by the LAPD and were never addressed by the judicial process.<br />What made this case so hot that the 1997 Congressional Investigation wouldn't touch it? Will the assassination of RFK ever be reinvestigated by a Congressional Committee? We've also learned a lot since 1991 about the LAPD and the FBI: the Trial of OJ Simpson, and the Inspector General's report on the FBI.

This book is definitely worth reading. The twenty countries of Latin America share a common history of conquest, slavery, colonization, and revolution. It has a youthful population, and is a land inhabited for over a thousand years. It is part of the developing world, and has a European culture. It has a few large countries, and a lot of small ones. All of Latin America is about twice the size of the US in land area and population, but the US economy is six times larger.<br />After independence the countries faced enormous difficulties due to economic devastation, and unfair trade. Government funding depended on import/export tariffs, and had professional armies to maintain. Politicians used the spoils system and patronage to govern, and rigged elections. (This was similar to the US of yesteryear, or today.) Liberalism and neocolonialism worsened the lives of most rural peoples in the late 19th century. Nationalism helped to unite the countries against foreign imperialism. The Great Depression resulted in increased industrialization in response to lost exports. After WW II the US forced South America countries back to its neocolonial past as commodity producers. A country that resisted this saw its government overthrown, and ruled by a military junta.<br />The Cuban revolution led to the overthrow of most governments by military juntas. The faults and failures of military rule brought their end. The small countries of Central America continued to have large landowners and masses of peons, as in the 19th century. Neoliberalism now reigns supreme in Latin America. The state-run corporations were sold off to foreign interests; subsidies and public services for the poor were reduced or eliminated. It was a return to the late 19th century: foreign banks profited while many people suffered and starved. Foreign companies exploited cheap labor. Any gains as consumers were wiped out by losses as producers. What will occur next?	2001-06-27

He is the only lawyer and judge to write about this case, based on the trial transcript. He also provides more historical details about the Fall River of 1892. He interviewed Abby Borden Whitehead Potter (the niece) who was born in 1883 and recalled the events in 1972. His conclusion was that there could be no other murderer than Lizzie Borden. But no bloodstained dress or hatchet was ever found! This book is based on the known facts; Arnold R. Brown solved the murders by getting the unknown facts.<br />Robert Sullivan is puzzled by the trial, and the actions of the judges and prosecutors. He believes the judges were &quot;incorrupt&quot;. Public opinion came to believe that Lizzie was guilty, and paid off the judges and prosecutors to be found &quot;not guilty&quot;. Arnold R. Brown showed that Lizzie was truly guiltless of the murders, and paid off the judges and prosecutors to be found not guilty! The book reprints Judge Justin Dewey's charge to the jury; it is as true today as then.<br />&quot;... In direct evidence witnesses testify that they have actual and immediate knowledge of the matter to be proved, so the main thing to be determined is whether the witnesses are worthy of belief. The chief difficulty with this kind of evidence is that the witnesses may be false or mistaken, while the nature of the case may be such that there are no means of discovering the falsehood or mistake. <br />In circumstantial evidence the facts relied upon are usually various and testified to by a large number of witnesses.... When the evidence comes from several witnesses and different sources, it is thought that there is more difficulty in arranging it so as to exscape detection if it is false or founded on mistake....<br />... expert testimony constitutes a class of evidence which the law requires you to subject to careful scrutiny. It is a matter of frequent observation to see experts of good standing expressing conflicting and irreconcilable views upon questions arising at a trial. They sometimes manifest a strong bias or partisan spirit in favor of the party employing them. They often exhibit a disposition to put forward theories rather than to verify or establish or illustrate the facts.... The jury has the full right to consider them, .., to give to the testimony of the experts such value and weight as it seems to deserve.&quot;	2001-06-25

Edgar Hoover	Books	4	11	16	N	N	Hoover's Secret Life Publicized	The 35 unlisted chapters tell of J.Edgar Hoover's secret life while ruling the FBI for 48 years. William Hitz, a relative, helped him to get a job with the Library of Congress after high school (his father was put into an asylum, his mother received no pension, and JEH became the sole support of the family). JEH attended George Washington University Las School at night. After graduation he joined the Dept. of Justice. GWU graduates and his Kappa Alpha fraternity were among his closest associates (p.61). (The author did not mention his Masonic Lodge or the connection with General Ralph Van Deman.) JEH attracted favorable notice by A. Bruce Bielaski, head of the Bureau of Investigation.<br />JEH's first action, after becoming Director, was to clean up the Bureau. During his reign corruption among FBI agents was unheard of - a rare achievement in any police force. But he also avoided policing drug traffic because of the risk of corruption (p.50). JEH also denied the existence of organized crime; Chpaters 21-23 explain why.<br />JEH benefited greatly under FDR, a fellow Mason. From the Civil War the Secret Service (as its name implies) handled counter-intelligence; FDR re-assigned this to the FBI for reasons of state and his own political benefit (p.105). The FBI soon began to conduct political intelligence: investigating striking mill workers (whose benefit?), the ACLU, the American Nazi movement, etc. These matters had nothing to do with law enforcement. (When the FBI was created in 1908, those who voted against it said it would become a Secret Police on the European model.) Spying on Americans would be pursued &quot;with the utmost degree of secrecy&quot;; there was no written official memorandum. JEH created a &quot;Custodial Detention List&quot; of people who would be jailed in time of war. It included Harrison Salisbury of the New York Times - as an alleged Nazi employee (p.108)! FDR also authorized uncontrolled wiretapping by the FBI (p.113). Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon also used his wiretaps (p.115).<br />Pages 122-129 retell the story of Dusan Popov and his 1941 interview with JEH. Popov was a Nazi spy and British double agent who was sent to Pearl Harbor to gather information for the Japanese attack. The failure to use this information is presented as a great mistake. But the publication of Robert B. Stinnett's &quot;Day of Deceit&quot; shows a reason  for this seeming mistake.<br />Pages 145-147 tell about the surveillance on Joseph Lash. When FDR was informed of his alleged affair with Eleanor, he ordered the soldiers in the unit sent to fight in the front lines!<br />Chapter 20 tells how Hoover and Tolson were guilty of federal offenses: private use of government property, accepting gifts from lesser-paid employees. They could have been dismissed and given ten years.<br />Pages 270-273 tell how JFK chose LBJ as vice-president. Pages 290-294 discusses the rumors about JFK's first marriage. Page 335 quotes high-level officials who suggest JEH was senile in his late 60s; to justify the mandatory retirement at 70?<br />Page 365 discusses the evidence in Senator RF Kennedy's assassination: &quot;twelve or more bullets were fired. Sirhan's gun was capable of firing only eight&quot;. Two gunmen were involved! The autopsy of RFK said he was killed by a bullet fired into the back of his head from a distance of 2.5 inches; all the eyewitnesses said Sirhan was firing from the front and never closer than 6 feet.<br />Chapter 34 tells of Nixon's attempts to fire JEH; Nixon couldn't. Nixon denied that it was due to blackmail, but Kissinger tells a different story (p.405). JEH was bugging Nixon in more ways that one (p.407).<br />This book gives the backstage view to people who only saw it from the audience.	2001-06-22

He was trained as an MD, and started writing to supplement his income. His literary skills brought him great wealth and fame. He had enormous self-confidence, the courage of his convictions, and was never afraid of controversy. He vigorously campaigned on behalf of prisoners wrongly convicted. This book is well worth reading about this paradoxical and versatile man.<br />His experiences in the Boer War showed him the British Army was antiquated and in need of immediate and drastic reform. The cavalry was outdated; artillery should be diversified and camouflaged; rifle drill was more important than parade drill. Officers should not wear distinctive uniforms, and should end their luxorious habits that made it hard for a poor man to accept a commission (p.237). He advocated a civilian military reserve of well-trained citizens, and nationwide rifle clubs. By 1906 there was a national federation of rifle clubs. The British won the Boer War thru a scorched earth policy, and placing Boer women and children in concentration camps. ACD defended the British in a pamphlet that was widely distributed. He was later made a knight bachelor and Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Surrey (p.241).<br />ACD introduced Norwegian skiing to Switzerland in 1894 (p.172), memorialized in a plaque in Davos. When he visited America he just missed meeting Oliver Wendell Holmes, who he admired (p.200). He introduced golf to New England (p.201).<br />In 1886 he got the idea of writing about a detective who would solve cases by his scientific methods, and not by the folly of the criminal. He was inspired by the works of Edgar Allen Poe and Emile Gaboriau, and the vast number of murders and crimes reported in the national press.

It gives a good overview of the case, comparable to Rick Geary's illustrated book, and is a simple introduction to this case.<br />The author lists many sources in the &quot;Chapter Notes&quot;, some of which may not be readily available.  Some of the sources are Internet sites. There is no rating on the quality of the books on this case.  &quot;Further Reading&quot; does not list Arnold R. Brown's book, or David Kent's &quot;Forty Whacks&quot;.<br />There is a problem in the quality of the books, as shown on page 98.  Everyone before spoke of the sweltering hear of those August 1892 days. But one writer claims that this was a &quot;myth&quot; because of one newspaper report! No corroboration is given for this claim.  Can you believe everything you read in the newspapers, then or now?  Eyewitness testimony is more reliable than hearsay.<br />The books on the case fall into two categories: she did it (Pearson, Sullivan, etc.), or she didn't (Radin, Spiering, Brown, etc.).  The jury said &quot;not guilty&quot; and no one can ever prove otherwise.  Arnold R. Brown's book explains it all.	2001-06-18

Is there a worldwide conspiracy bent on subversion of freedom and democracy?  Or is it just the irrational ramblings of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;?  This book attempts to answer these questions.<br />Do people believe that individuals with vast wealth and power, and unknown to the public, are the real masters in the U.S.?  Are key political, economic, and social decisions made by a tiny minority?  We know that very few people own most of the net financial assets, and their share has been increasing during the 1990s.  Is this natural evolution, or planning for a New World Order?<br />The chapter on &quot;Secrets of Money and the Federal Reserve System&quot; is a good example to show how this racket works.  He writes how private bankers conspired to create the Federal Reserve System - which gave them control over the nation's money supply.  The U.S. borrows money from them, and pays interest on it - the national debt.  Its like your paycheck being deposited into your employer's bank, and you being charged to borrow your own money!  In effect, the U.S. taxes everybody to benefit these private bankers.  In June 1963 President Kennedy authorized the issuance of &quot;United States Notes&quot; through the U.S. Treasury (as the Constitution requires) to lower the national debt (p.129).  The next President soon reversed this order (p.131).<br />The 1996 &quot;Report from Iron Mountain&quot; seems like a blueprint for the events leading to today's society (pp. 113-117).	2001-06-11

Dershowitz seems to think that OJ was guilty, but the Prosecution could not prove it.  The testimony of the two witnesses who cannot lie say that OJ Simpson is not guilty.  <br />Blood and flesh were found under Nicole Brown's fingernails; the blood type did not match OJ (or Nicole or Ron). Ron Goldman walked to work, worked out, and practiced karate; his hands showed bruises from punching someone in the face or head more than once. OJ had no scratches or bruises on his hands, arms, face, or body: he could not have been a lone murderer.<br />The newspapers said that when the bodies were found after 12:15 AM their red blood was trickling down the sidewalk. The crime scene pictures printed in the National Enquirer showed the red blood.  This says they were freshly killed, around 11:30, because their blood would be black and clotted if dead for over an hour (as in the Borden Murders).<br />The above physical evidence proves OJ Simpson to be innocent of these murders. Some say the 25 to 30 stab wounds on Ron Goldman suggest an emotional frenzy from a personal enemy, and Nicole Brown was the innocent bystander. The book &quot;Killing Time&quot; is the first and only objective book (arguments for both sides) to discuss all the evidence.<br />I hope that people will reconsider any prejudgments that they made in June 1994.	2001-06-11

James Michener loved sports: they made the difference between life and death.  As a youth he drifted into a bad crowd, but was saved by athletics.  His skill in basketball led to a scholarship to college, rather than prison.  Later in life he suffered a heart attack, and was delayed in getting to a hospital.  He survived because his robust exercise helped his heart to develop alternate feed lines (p.8).<br />Chapter IX discusses &quot;The Inescapable Problem&quot; of aging and the decline in physical ability.  Walking, swimming, and tennis are doable from ages 5 to 85 (pp.274-5).  Most other sports peak at ages 24 to 32;  forty is the usual limit. The author notes that athletes are provably in better shape than the general public; but their life expectancy is worse.  Could this be a side effect from the fame and glory?<br />He discusses the case of those who get a sports scholarship.  They spend their college time in sports, play professionally for a few years, then disappear.  He shows that those who study in college (like accounting) can earn far more onver a lifetime than those who quickly burn out.	2001-06-08

The bottom of p.9 telegraphs the purpose of this book: &quot;what if we discover that early American men did not have that special bond with their guns?&quot;  This book is written to disprove the known historical reality.  Keep this in mind as you read this book.<br />On p.4 he claims &quot;an astounding high level of personal violence separates the U.S. from every other industrial nation&quot;, but he gives no proof for his claim.  It seems like the &quot;argument from ignorance&quot; logical fallacy.  More violence than in Brazil, Argentina, or Mexico?  They all had similar historical development in this hemisphere.  Or is he talking about western Europe, where Social Democratic policies have long be in use?<br />On p.5 he argues that guns only became common in the mid-nineteenth century, and were concentrated in urban areas!  Could it be that people own guns, and people were concentrated in urban areas?  He also claims the U.S. government worked to arm its citizens, but gives no proof on this page.<br />On p.6 he claims &quot;car magazines ... often publish articles highly critical of the automotive industry&quot; but can give no proof.  When I read these magazines I saw they lavishly praised the products advertised in their pages.  Do they condemn products NOT advertised?  Don't the other hobby magazines operate the same way?<br />On p.7 he mentions the &quot;view that citizens have a constitutionally protected right to own machine guns&quot;.  But don't the citizens of Sweden and Switzerland have that right, even without a Second Amendment?  Perhaps it has something to do with being peaceful and neutral?<br />On p.12 he seems to use the lack of records for proof that there was no &quot;American gun culture&quot;. (But who invented this phrase?)  Some of the reviews say his research can not be duplicated, and he destroyed or discarded his notes.  Was that a responsible scholarly act?<br />On p.13 he says he examined more than a thousand probate records from northern New England and western Pennsylvania.  The vagueness of these locations makes it difficult to check his research.  On p.14 he claims there was no &quot;well-armed public&quot; before 1850!  Did Patrick Henry or Eldridge Gerry say so?<br />On p.15 he talks about deer hunters in New York.  He compares the PERCENTAGE of muzzle-loader hunters to the NUMBERS of deer culled by archers!  He ignores the length and timing of these seasons; would a truth-seeking scholar do this?  He doesn't say if the archers later went hunting with guns.<br />On pages 20-22 he tells of the need to keep firearms from the hands of the common people.  And THAT is today's motive for &quot;gun control&quot; - you can't oppress a well-armed people either in Aristotle's time or today.  And you don't have to ban a product if people don't want it.<br />Reading the rest of the book is left as an exercise to the student.  Will it be as good, or bad, as the first pages?	2001-06-06

Mark Olshaker is a novelist and filmmaker; this book is very readable and entertaining.  The book lists no sources or footnotes for their chapters.<br />The book's chapters are: &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;, &quot;Lizzie Borden&quot;, &quot;The Lindbergh Kidnapping&quot;, &quot;The Zodiac&quot;, &quot;The JonBenet Ramsey Murder&quot;, and a catch-all chapter.  There is no &quot;Trail of OJ Simpson&quot; but references to it are sprinkled in some chapters; why not?  My comments are on the the trial of Lizzie Borden.<br />On pages 114-116 JD imagines how he could get Lizzie Borden to confess - to a crime she didn't commit!  His invention of a scandalous past for LB reminds me of those stories of &quot;recovered memories&quot;.  He says this trick works if he can keep a dialogue going - which could mean he puts ideas in their minds and words in their mouths.  He would try to use a compliant press to present himself as one who &quot;might understand&quot;.  The fact of LB's innocence of the murders seems to be irrelevant.<br />What I learned from this book is not to talk to the police unless your lawyer is present.  JD makes this point perfectly clear for Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ramsey.  It also helps if you're rich enough to hire the best lawyers in town, and then move to another state.  JD correctly recommends making the FBI Crime Lab independent.  Read &quot;Tainting Evidence&quot; by J. Kelly and P. Wearne to learn why.	2001-06-04

Only the mission chapel remains today; the former convent or &quot;long barrack&quot; was torn down before 1913.  That's where most of the fighting and dying occurred in March 1836.  It was never a military fort, altho the high walls gave protection against any Comanche raid against the settlement.<br />The captured guns at the Alamo needed 300 men to service them; only half that number was there.  It may have been better to send half the guns north to reinforce General Sam Houston's army.<br />In 1824 the federal democratic republics of Mexico and the US were about equal in area and population (p.7).  One thrived, the other didn't.  Mexican history is full of coups, revolts, and bloody repressions; the legacy of the Spanish reconquista and imperialism?  George Washington warned us of &quot;factions&quot;, and we took his advice.  While our federal system has worked well, it could depend on factors outside of the written constitution.<br />Chapter 1 explains the background of Mexican history.  Conservative elements of society helped to denounce the liberal federal constitution of 1824.  They wanted a centralized and dictatorial government.  State governments and legislatures would be appointed by the central government; a uniform tax, civil, and criminal code was imposed.  The state militias would be suppressed.  This aroused instant bitter resentment throughout Mexico, and rebellion in Zacatecas and Texas.  The Zacatecan militia was the largest in Mexico: 24,000 on the muster rolls, 4,000 armed and uniformed men.  Since it had the valuable silver mines, Santa Anna attacked them first.  The legislature of Coahuila y Texas proclaimed the civic militia to be &quot;the only bulwark of liberty protecting the rights of the community&quot;.  Santa Anna's regime reminded the Anglos in Texas of King George and Royal Britain.<br />Zacatecans had more liberty because property there was more evenly divided, and had a strong middle class.  There were few large landowners left; some large haciendas had been divided and distributed to small property holders.  On paper, their militia were a match to Santa Anna's army; but not in reality.  General Santa Anna was experienced, and his troops well trained.  The Zacatecans were businessmen, peasants, artisans, and farmers who worked every day and spent little time on drills.  Santa Anna developed a plan: when the infantry attacked from the front, artillery would attack from the flanks, and the cavalry attack from the rear.  His cazadore sharpshooters silenced the Zacatecan artillery.  In two hours it was all over, and the slaughter and looting followed.  His troops plundered Zacatecas for two days.  He also ordered the death of all Anglos - engineers, accountants, and the military advisors to the Zacatecan militia.  Then it was north to Texas.<br />If Santa Anna imagined himself the &quot;Napoleon of the West&quot;, the Anglo settlers of Texas considered themselves the heirs of the War of Independence, fighting for freedom against arbitrary and dictatorial royal rule.  Their fathers and grandfathers fought in the Revolutionary War, the Second War of Independence, and the Indian Wars.  While the Mexican Army had dusty gunpowder (due to corruption?), the Anglos had hard-grain DuPont.  The Mexican Army used conscript convicts; the Anglos were all volunteers who believed in their cause.  Didn't Napoleon say morale is one of the most important weapons in an army?<br />This book also covers the 20th century battles to preserve this historic place.  It tells how and why the actual site of most of the fighting was torn down.  And of the revisionist history books recently published.  It is worth reading as the one book on the subject.	2001-05-24

FBI lab management failed to check examinations and lab reports, allowed and inadequate record system, and had covered up incompetence instead of investigating them.  This book goes beyond the IG's report thru reporting documents released under the Freedom of Information Act.  The FBI lab has never agreed to real external scrutiny, never published the research data used for its forensic tests, never revealed the results of its own internal proficiency tests.  This book is both educational and entertaining.<br />Most forensic scientists are not independent experts; most are affiliated with police or prosecutions agencies.  Their job is to build a case for the prosecution.  The authors mention the TV show &quot;Quincy&quot;; &quot;CSI&quot; is a better and current example, though a drama.<br />One example given is &quot;voiceprints&quot; - a unique pattern for any single individual's speech.  But research by the National Academy of Sciences concluded there is no validity to this claim.  Another fault is to use overstated conclusions using undefined terms such as &quot;match&quot; or &quot;identical to&quot;.  Its purpose is to hide information that is &quot;discoverable&quot;.  The FBI interpretation of the adversarial approach of the justice system serves neither science nor truth.<br />The FBI system is to let a civilian scientist do the tests, but have an FBI agent testify about them in court.  This prevents a defendant from confronting the witness!  And their lab does not meet ASCLD/LAB accreditation criteria.<br />Chapter 7 says that DNA typing is NOT a genetic fingerprint; to portray is as such is scientific fraud.Fingerprints are unique, DNA profiles are not.  DNA typing produces a random probability match, not a definitive match.  There are 3 problems in its use.  It came out of regulated, pristine medical labs, but was adapted to unregulated crime labs; making a match is far from scientifically certain, it can be highly subjective; and, the means of computing statistical probability of a match was disputed.  And evidence could have been both contaminated and planted.  The odds of a match are created subjectively.<br />Chapter 4 on Ruby Ridge explains it all.	2001-05-24

It is NOT a muck-raking investigation into the meat processing industry!  It is a novel about an immigrant European family that comes to Chicago (at the end of the century) and is destroyed in that urban jungle.  Drugs, crime, and prostitution are not new problems.<br />A few pages in that book describe the workings of a meat processing plant.  All too true, as the later investigations proved.  The character who worked there was later hospitalized, and found out where the market was for sub-standard goods: institutions where the consumers have no choice!  Remember, there had been scandals about &quot;embalmed beef&quot; during the Spanish-American War.<br />The book is still as entertaining and educational today as it was when it was first published.

Potato processors add sugar in the fall, and remove it in the spring for a uniform taste and appearance.<br />Fast food workers are the largest group of minimum wage earners in America.  Only migrant farm workers earn less.  The fast food industry exploits children, both as workers and as customers.<br />Chapter 2 (p.54) tells of the profit margin on soda:...Twenty years ago teenagers drank twice as much milk as soda; now its the reverse.  This can lead to calcium deficiencies and more bone fractures; the \\"liquid candy\\" leads to an epidemic of obesity.<br />Chapter 3 notes that there is nothing in a fast food kitchen that requires young, lo-paid workers in place of stable, well-paid and well-trained workers.  The \\"Work Opportunity Tax Credit\\" gives tax credits...for each new worker hired for at least 400 hours.  It is repeated when a worker is replaced. Could this explain the high turnover rates?<br />Chapter 4 explains the franchise business.  The franchiser can expand an existing company without spending his own money; the franchisee can start his business with going alone and risking everything on a new idea.  When the profits roll in, both are happy; when things go bad the franchiser usually wins.  Franchising is not new; car manufacturers have done it for a century. It uses the money of small investors, not banks or Wall Street.<br />...The rest of the book is filled with nourishing information.<br />The book tells of the problems due to industrial processing of ground meat....<br />I will continue to order a baked potato instead of french fries!	2001-05-21

He repeats the claim that only &quot;one third&quot; wanted to separate from Britain (p.xii).  Can this ever be true then or now?  I would estimate that about 3 out of 4 would be a more realistic figure (from what I read about other countries).  John Adams history of the Revolution was flawed by his notoriously bad memory (p.293).  Or the way he wanted to remember it?<br />It tells how the Stamp Act resulted in the colonies forming a Congress and asking for its repeal, a direct tax.  Americans did not have the gold and silver to pay the stamp duty (p.30).  They raised their own food, and bartered; they could not print paper money.<br />On p.60 he says there is no &quot;Butcher's Hall&quot; on the site of the Boston Massacre (as depicted in Paul Revere's engraving)!  Isn't that a symbol for the British barracks?<br />On p.64 he claims that a &quot;guinea&quot; is a pound (it is 21 shillings), and only worth about $1.35!  That's way too low!  Compare the price of homes, wages, etc. to find out its worth then.  Page 82 repeats this mistake in currency evaluation (&quot;$81&quot;).  Page 101 tells of Tom Paine's suggested old age pension of &quot;ten pounds a year&quot;; that would make their pound worth about $1000.  He also mentions a great increase in the poor before the revolution, but doesn't go into the cause.<br />Tradition tells of suffering, starvation, and death at Valley Forge (p.205).  A National Park Service survey in the 1970s claimed differently; each month the 10,000 man army received a million pounds of flour, and a million pounds of meat and fish (3 pounds each a day).  Surely the tradition is correct, and not the paper figures.  But the winters in Morristown NJ were worse.<br />He notes that 18th century usage of words differs from the 20th century meanings.  I read that &quot;well-regulated&quot; then meant &quot;well-trained&quot; or &quot;well-practiced&quot;.<br />Chapter 8 discusses the East India Company's near bankruptcy in 1771.  It got a government monopoly in the American market; no one could buy from any other source.  This resulted in a 50% rise in price!  Americans refused to buy it; in New York and Charleston they threw the tea into the river, and the bay in Boston.  This led to hoarding weapons and gunpowder in the country, and the Battles of Lexington and Concord when the British tried to seize these weapons (a violation of their Bill of Rights).<br />Another factor was the Quebec Act, which extended Canada's southern boundary to the Ohio River.  Forbidding emigration west of the Allegheny Mountains would prevent veterans of the French and Indian War from gaining their promised lands.<br />But the closing of the port of Boston resulted in uniting the colonies; they sent food to Boston.  Committees of Correspondence were created to communicate between the colonies.  Then the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia; we know the rest.<br />The author tells how the military trainers had to explain the purpose of the actions (the big picture).  And how one of the most important military skills taught was bayonet drill.  Is this still true today?	2001-05-17

If he punched out at 9:58, walked home a half-mile (10:10), changed clothes, walked to that borrowed car (10:15), drove to Nicole's house and found a parking spot on the next block (10:30), then the earliest time he could have been attacked was 10:35.

This &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; attitude stacked the deck against OJ.  (Shouldn't the side presenting the evince should authenticate it?)

Thirteen chapters cover various topics from that century, and tells you things left out of the movies and TV shows.<br />Those over forty remember various movies and TV shows about cowboys and cattle herds (&quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, etc.).  But this era lasted only about 25 years.  A cow sold for $4 in TX, $40 in KS; we would call them arbitrageurs nowadays.  People preferred the taste of longhorn cattle over domestic beeves.  Is there something to be relearned here?  Free-range meat?<br />It retells the importance of the railroads in the history of the 19th century America, and the Chicago stockyards (another memory).  Railroads long ago spent their Govt. subsidies; trucking still benefits from Govt. super-highway system.<br />Mike Wright questions Wild Bill Hickok's claim to having killed &quot;a hundred men&quot;, saying it was maybe 15 or so as a cattle town lawman.  But Wm. Hickok had been a Jayhawker, Civil War soldier, Army scout, etc.  I wouldn't dispute that claim, exaggerated or not.	2001-05-02

The subjects covered (&quot;Interview in Weehawken&quot;) will tell you more than what you learned in school about these events. Depth of coverage, not breadth. And you will NEVER read &quot;The War on Powder River&quot; in a schoolbook!<br />The &quot;Foreward&quot; contrasts American myths with those from classic times as a reflection of popular culture. The Ancients had Thermopylae, we have the Alamo.<br />The murder rate in America is higher than in Europe, Canada, or Australia. But the latter  countries did not have 300 years of Indian Wars, or anything like them, since the Dark Ages. They did not have waves of immigration, or slavery of another race. You have to look at South American countries for similar historical backgrounds. The author cites Medellin Columbia  and Rio de Janeiro for high murder rates; these  countries had similar development, if different cultural backgrounds, from America. Those who point to Europe as a peaceful place avoid their wars, revolutions, purges, and civil wars. Is this ignorance or dishonesty?<br />In Europe violence tends to be collective; in America it is individual. Americans don't want the government to do what can be done by private individuals!	2001-04-30

He is a native Virginian which  gives him better insight into this topic.  If the &quot;Civil War&quot; only means dates, names, and battles to you, this book gives concrete facts that helps you to understand those times.  The book is well worth reading, as entertaining as it is educational.<br />Mike Wright says &quot;no one has yet determined just where 'yankee' originated&quot; (p.xx). James Fenimoore Cooper had  the Indians speak of the &quot;yengeese&quot;.  I think this word is the Indian pronunciation of &quot;English&quot; (soft vowel, dropped &quot;l&quot;, hard &quot;s&quot;). It was first used to differentiate the rebel Colonials from the loyalist Englishmen.  Then to describe the Union supporters.  Often derogatory, as slang often is.<br />The only complaint I have is that the book isn't longer!	2001-04-30

This is his story of his career, including his anecdotes about his American allies. He joined MI5 as a scientist who specialized in tools for espionage. He had been promised credit for his years as a civilian scientist. When this promise was broken at retirement, he wrote this book to even out things.<br />This is an interesting book that can't be summarized in a few paragraphs. It is definitely worth reading for the details on government activities in a &quot;democracy&quot;. Watergate was a notable failure of such activities. Do these activities continue? Of course!<br />Pages 158-9 tell of his proposal for a &quot;Bolshevik model&quot; for former colonial countries: let a political party control the army and secret police so that neither the army or another political party could gain control of the government. He pointed out that only those newly created countries that adopted this principle have escaped military dictatorships and civil war.<br />Does the above advice seem to cynical and radical? But our Establishment DOES control the army and secret police so that neither the military or a populist political party (one not controlled by corporate interests) can gain control.<br />Yet the classic solution for democracies, from Aristotle to Machiavelli to our Founding Fathers was well-armed citizens and  their militia. It has worked well for over over a century, and the idea still survives today.	2001-04-24

John R. Lott Jr. studied the results from states that passed &quot;shall issue&quot; (or &quot;right to carry&quot;) laws and compared the results: personal crimes (murder, rape, assault) decreased, property crimes (auto theft, etc.) increased. Since personal crimes cost mush more than property crimes, billions of dollars were saved!  <br />Also, none of those states have ever seen a mass killing (like Columbine High School). The author points out that &quot;gun-free school zones&quot; create targets for madmen. Could this be the unstated hope of anti-gun fanatics like Handgun Control Inc.?  <br />He notes that crimes are reported by state level, but everyone lives in counties; crime rates vary widely by county in most states. His book lists facts about gun owners: rich and conservative are more likely that poor and liberals. But a family with a union member is more likely than a family with none.  <br />The &quot;Epilogue&quot; discusses the events that followed publication of the first edition. Anti-gun fanatics refused to review his book, but immediately announced that the book was &quot;flawed&quot;. Verdict first, trial afterwards? He notes that increased licensing fees and training costs reduce the benefits of more guns.  <br />A short review can not summarize this important book. My advice is to borrow and browse, or buy and study it; you won't be disappointed. But he does not discuss the political bent of the anti-gun fanatics, or the hidden forces behind them. You could read other books for insight on the need for armed citizens for democracy.	2001-03-02

Peterson joined Word Perfect in 1980 as a part-time office manager, and left as Executive VP of Sales in 1992. He says their success was based partly on luck: the right circumstances at the right time. They depended on their own efforts and finances, not on burning up borrowed money; did this concentrate their efforts on success?  <br />He says &quot;reliability was more important than price&quot; (p.41). A word processor is a means to an end, not an end in itself. A $1500 product can be less costly than a $500 product that breaks down more, once you include the effect of losses.  <br />Page 60 says the demise of word processing departments in the mid 1980s was unexpected. This happened to key-punch departments a decade earlier. Will Internet E-mail reduce the market for word processors in turn?  <br />The problem of printer support in WP was solved by the use of tables; but this resulted in slower printing. Isn't it better to use separate executable modules for each printer family?  <br />One very important item of their success was their evaluation of their product by consulting with the secretaries who used it. This is much better than an ad-hoc committee of non-users.  <br />His evaluation of other companies (p.100) is interesting. Using a &quot;lines of code&quot; rule alone may result in bloated and redundant code, which can lead to higher maintenance, overhead, and support costs.  <br />His story of the &quot;free Hawaii trip&quot; (pp.131-2) illustrates the difference between &quot;goals&quot; and &quot;objectives&quot;. A fixed cash bonus is a goal, a Hawaii trip an objective.  <br />In July 1991 Pete was informed that he &quot;was too hard on people and too many people were afraid&quot; of him. He seems to have ignored this warning. The stress of the delayed release may have been affecting a lot of people. If the VP of Development was giving lectures from a book, could this have caused the delay? Does this show a problem in a &quot;flat management&quot; philosophy? Is it correct for any large company? Can reading a book safeguard a company from Microsoft? Note that this clash of personalities did not occur when WP was profitable. &quot;Victory has a thousand fathers&quot;, falling sales has a thousand finger pointers.	2001-02-16

When I visited POK in May 1965 the area was abuzz with the story about the high-ranking manager who was fired and disgraced. (It was unusual to hear any talk about top management.)  Fifteen months later I heard about the success of a new management technique used there.  Six years later, after years of practical experience) the results were published. I wonder how much good it did since?  <br />In 1975 F.P.Brooks Jr. published his essays. The first edition explicitly noted his failure, and there was no mention of his successor. The second edition censored the details of his failure, and mentioned his successor in a footnote. He does not explain why one manager succeeded when another failed.  <br />The book does not mention a topic of discussion in the early 1960s: should a manager of programming also be a programmer?  GE and RCA said &quot;no&quot;, IBM said &quot;yes&quot;. By 1970 that question was no longer discussed.  When the programmers assigned to OS/360 refused to sign-off on the specifications and schedules, IBM turned to a Director of Engineering to head the project. Within a year the project was further behind schedule than when it started, and grossly over budget! has any other project before or since used an engineer to manage a  programming project?  <br />The most quoted essay is the chapter that repeats the title. It starts out by noting that most software projects go over schedule - as if this never happens in other areas! The correct answer is that most schedules are not based on reality, but on the wishes (fantasies?) of upper management. But no one dares to mention this fact!  <br />F.P. Brooks Jr. claims the term &quot;man-month&quot; is fallacious. Forty-two centuries of human experience says it it NOT - if the project is competently managed.  Doesn't he know that &quot;reaping wheat or picking cotton&quot; also has sequential constraints?  Most buildings start with detailed plans from experienced builders, and proceed from excavation for the foundation to the roof, sequential constraints.   <br />He fantasizes about &quot;pairwise intercommunication&quot;, an exercise that is a demonstration of deliberate poor judgment, or an attempt to explain away failure.  <br />In the &quot;Sharp Tools&quot; chapter F.P. Brooks says &quot;I am convinced that interactive systems will never displace batch systems for many applications&quot;. The response is&quot; word processors, spreadsheets, and the internet.  Does he lack &quot;the vision thing&quot;? Since 1965 he has never held another programming management job, or even in engineering, his area of expertise. Any reason why?  <br />Around 1942 Henry Kaiser revolutionized ship-building with his modular approach. Could this technique ever be used for computers and software?	2001-02-13

He invented a surprise solution: Emma did it!  I can't believe his conclusion.  <br />His book is worth reading because of all the background information he provides about the case, including some pictures not seen in earlier books.  It provides more information on Emma and the aftermath of the trial than in previous books.  It tells of the vicious campaign by the Fall River GLOBE against Lizzie, altho the Providence JOURNAL's editorial after the trial was more damning: &quot;if she knows who did it, why doesn't she speak out?&quot;.  Spieing (p.197) repeats the story of the 1897 confession altho E. Radin's book exposed it as a forgery in 1961, which he admits in his Notes (p.237).  <br />The best books are still Arnold R. Brown's masterpiece (which solved the crime), and David Kent's book of background material.

His sources list numerous manuscripts, interviews, newspapers, and published materials.  It is highly readable, too.  <br />    (William) Henry McCarty/Antrim/Bonney was a &quot;scrawny little fellow with delicate hands and an artistic nature always willing to help with chores around the school house&quot;. He was fond of music, and loved to sing and dance, and read books; then &quot;Police Gazette&quot; with its adventures and fantasies. After his mother's TB death and his step-father's departure to a mining camp, Henry fell into bad company and turned to petty thievery. He was caught and sent to jail. He showed his cunning by escaping thru the chimney, and into a life of crime. The Kid did not smoke or drink whiskey, he loved singing and dancing, gambling, gunmanship, and horsemanship; he also charmed young women.  <br />     For nearly fifty years after his death Billy the Kid was infamous as a murdering outlaw. In 1926 Walter Noble Burns (viewers of &quot;The Front Page&quot; may wonder if art imitates life) wrote &quot;The Saga of Billy the Kid&quot; and portrayed him as the Robin Hood of the Southwest.   <br />    More than forty Hollywood films have portrayed the Kid somewhere between hero to villain, depending on the times. Many Western films from yesteryear had a standard plot: powerful, greedy rancher or merchant, crooked sheriff and mayor, pliant judge, witnesses scared to testify, a land of sudden and violent death; and a hero to lead the fight against them.  Not unlike the Lincoln County War of 1878 (and others less well known) in the dramatized Hollywood version.   <br />     The above story symbolized not just the frontier, but the attitudes and values of the entire nation in the Gilded Age. Is this state of corruption unknown today? Do corporations, governments, and the law serve selfish interests and personal ambitions today? Are political, legal,and economic systems perverted for individual benefits? You can read the newspapers and judge for yourself.	2001-01-08

Nixon's 1962 &quot;Six Crises&quot;, he told how they &quot;built a machine&quot; in the Hiss case.  When this was publicized, this book was quickly changed.  In A. Hiss's book (p.304) &quot;we still had no idea that it was possible to construct a typewriter which duplicated the typographical imperfections of another machine.&quot;  &quot;The Quiet Canadian&quot;, published in 1963, had a few pages that told how this was done circa 1936.<br />Pages 403-4 states the scientific proof why the Hiss machine was a forgery:  the types on the Woodstock were soldered in a careless fashion;  the solder used on the types had a different metallic content from that used on other machines;  the typeface metal contained elements not used at the date of manufacture;  the altered types show tool marks unlike that found on normal types.   The photos between pages 374-5 show the unusual soldering of type onto the typebars.<br />The book tells how they wanted to get W. Chambers' 1935 passport and photo, but were prevented by the Govt.  W. Chambers' photo shows his sandy blonde hair, moustache, and about 145 pounds.  In 1948 he was bald, gray, and about 300 pounds - they look like two different people!<br />After his release from prison, AH spent many decades as a &quot;stationery salesman&quot;, but the press never revealed any more details.  Was his customer then a proprietary company of a Defense Dept. agency? If so, the truth is that AH was not guilty, but only a victim of inter-governmental rivalry.  This job was his reward for being a stand-up guy who took the hit and didn't squeal.<br />Hiss was very talented, but from a poor family (unlike the Dulles); his rise in the State Dept. was unusual, and he must have had rivals.  He later joined the &quot;Carnegie Endowment for International Peace&quot; (which sounds like a refuge for ex-OSS agents).<br />From the Civil War to the 1930s the Secret Service was in charge of counter-intelligence; then FDR turnedit over to the FBI.  J. Edgar Hoover hated William Donovan and his OSS.  He probably wanted to include their function as part of his empire.  So a false witness was created to destroy AH, and the rest of the secret operations (alluded to in p.414).  But the Establishment went on to found the CIA.	2001-01-05

Kennedy	Books	5	16	19	N	N	Complete Documentation on Part of the Picture	The author is on the Board of Advisors of the Assassination Archives and Research Center in Washington DC. His book contains many references and citations for his sources, and documentation. It is very good as far as it goes, but only gives part of the big picture. Organized crime can kill anybody, but they can't cover it up without Establishment collusion. Mark North's &quot;Act of Treason&quot; documents this collusion, and complements and extends this work. <br />The empire of organized crime struck back at the author. A few years ago the Republican Congress reorganized the National Institutes of Health and used the usual bureaucratic tricks to end his employment. But his book continues to educate people. <br />Chapter 22 discusses Richard Nixon. Around 20 years ago I saw him on TV; when asked about the 19 minute gap on the tape, he smiled and said it was about the &quot;Bay of Pigs&quot; operation. I thought he seemed to be lying, but didn't know why. Years later I read Henry Haldeman's thin book. In it he concluded that the &quot;Bay of Pigs' operation was a code word for the assassination of JFK. You can look it up.	2000-12-01

Simpson is not guilty of the murders.  The autopsy of Nicole Brown found blood and flesh under her fingernails; the blood type did not match O.J. Simpson (or Ron Goldman or Nicole Brown). Ron Goldman worked out and practiced karate a couple of times a week, he played tennis, and walked to work. At 25 he was in prime physical shape; his hands showed bruises from punching someone in the face and head more than once. O.J. Simpson had no scratches or bruises on his face or hands or body after the murders; he could not have been a lone murderer.<br />The newspapers reported that when the victims were found after 12:15 AM their red blood was trickling down the sidewalk. The color photographs printed in the National Enquirer showed the bodies covered in red blood. This means they were freshly killed, around 11:30 PM, because their blood would be black and clotted if dead for over an hour (as in the Borden murders). Since the limousine driver picked up O.J. Simpson at 11 PM he could not have been present at the murders. This proves him innocent of murder.<br />The O.J. Simpson case received more publicity absolutely and relatively than the impeachment of the President, or even the Oklahoma City bombing. The National Association of Editors and Publishers has never explained why. You could ask the rumor mongers on talk radio why they were told to publicize and prejudge this case before the facts came out at the trial, and why some continue to ignore these facts. I think this is more than the gossip of idle tongues. This case could become a textbook example in the use of propaganda by the news media.<br />The book &quot;Killing Time&quot; by D. Freed and R. Briggs, which covers this case, also tells about the &quot;Black Dahlia&quot; crime which was never solved even after the murderer confessed! Will the Brown-Goldman murders forever remain an unsolved mystery?<br />Logically and legally a person is considered innocent until proven guilty. If not found guilty, the accused is innocent. People do not always understand or accept this in all cases. But a jury is always told to wait until all the testimony is given before deciding on a verdict. Many people will form an opinion when they hear the first news, and ignore newer facts.	2000-11-29

It has no index; but you should not read it as a sole source.  After the arrest of OJ, they both agreed &quot;the overwhelming physical evidence makes this case appear more solid than any they had ever seen before&quot; in their entire careers (p.193).  Was this too good to be true?<br />They interviewed the General Manager of Mezzaluna Trattoria, who had &quot;admonished Goldman to use caution in his relationship with Nicole Brown&quot;, but didn't state the reason - another overlooked clue?  They say both victims frequented the Mark Stevens Gym, but don't explain the implications (p.59).<br />They talk about the blood sample freely given by OJ - about 8.5cc according to the preliminary hearing.  When the amount became controversial, the testimony was later changed to 6.5cc!  Could a 20+ year experienced nurse make this mistake?<br />Vannatter picked up the two blood samples from the Coroner and carried them to the Scientific Investigation Division; but this was &quot;unusual for a lead detective&quot; (p.126).  Could another irregularity have occurred?  Steven Singular's &quot;Legacy of Deception&quot; says that &quot;all the blood evidence is suspect&quot;.  He also tells who planted the glove.  Were the socks also planted?  If a guilty OJ could get rid of the bloody clothes, shoes, and knives then the glove and socks would have disappeared as well.<br />Dominique Brown pointed to a &quot;black low-cut pair of shoes&quot; as seen on OJ in Easter 1994; these are the Bruno Magli shoes with the Silga soles (p.215).  No pictures of these shoes are given.  Is this because they don't match any of those publicized photos?<br />The prosecution claimed that the attack was quick and deadly, with little blood on the killer.  If so, wouldn't that mean that the blood found at OJ's house had to be planted?  The 25 to 30 stab wounds say it wasn't a short, quick fight.  The stab wounds on Ron Goldman's right front and right back imply both a left-handed and a right-handed killers.  This corresponds to the two different knife wounds noted in Nicole's autopsy: a single-edged hunting knife, and a double-edged stiletto.  You can read it for yourself.	2000-11-09

Why do we have 1,500,000 sailors and soldiers with no major threat to our country?  This book tries to answer these questions.<br />The US historically had two armies: a Regular Army of professional soldiers, and a citizen army variously known as militia, National Guard, Organized Reserves, selectees.  Each represents a political outlook: centralized national government for the first, a decentralized popular government for the latter.<br />A permanent standing military seeks causes for its continued existence, and resources to maintain itself. An army of the people would debate its purpose and use; and will be anxious to return to civilian life.<br />Historically, standing armies have resulted in military coups, civil wars, and oppression of the common people.  You can read about this in the history books, or in today's newspapers that carry foreign news.<br />In 1783 Congress requested Washington's views for a peacetime military establishment.  Washington relied on the advice of Von Steuben, who advocated a Swiss system of citizen soldiers as most appropriate to democracies. J.M. Palmer also recommended that the national defense force should be well-trained citizens rather than standing army professionals in keeping the military establishment democratic.<br />A quote from J.M. Palmer is important. &quot;A free state cannot continue to be democratic in peace and autocratic in war.  Standing armies threaten government by the people, not because they consciously seek to pervert liberty, but because they relieve the people themselves of the duty of self-defense.  A people accustomed to let a special class defend them must sooner of later become unfit for liberty.&quot;	2000-11-01

Alexis DeTocqueville's &quot;Democracy in America&quot; explained why there are two chambers.  A yearly elected Assembly to respond to the people's wants; a triannually elected Senate to provide a more farsighted view as to the people's needs.  The Senate would also impeach judges, state officials, and the governor as needed.  The one state with a unicameral legislature may also have an egalitarian and homogenous population with similar interests.<br />The cure for too-powerful representatives is simple: select committees and chairman by lot.  Once these elections can't be fixed the power of the special interests will be greatly reduced.<br />The correct campaign reform law is to ban all broadcast political advertising; they are either lies or half-truths.  Printed literature will last long enough to check the promises against the achievements.  Candidates will not have to sell their souls to the devils of special interests.  The next step should be to ban any contributions from corporate entities; they are not real people.  This will return campaigns to a very level playing field.<br />In &quot;Tort Reform: Civilizing Our Civil Courts&quot; he asks why so many lawyers are politicians.  That was answered by DeTocqueville in Volume I.  That's like asking why so many people in rural areas go hunting.<br />In &quot;Tax Reform&quot; he complains about the income tax, and high property taxes.  (Isn't an income tax just a type of property tax?)  To lower property taxes you must either give localities and counties part of the state sales tax, or part of the income tax.  You can't do anything else!<br />There are many other topics covered in this book.  Most are common-sense proposals that are unusual to hear from a politician; but J.V. is not an ordinary politician.  You should read the chapter on &quot;Education&quot;.	2000-10-27

It tells of his efforts to neutralize and defeat the Nazis in South and North America, before America entered the war.  After &quot;A Man Called Intrepid&quot; became a best-seller in 1976, it was republished.  It provides more history than the few pages in the later book.  There are many interesting stories in this book.<br />One of them is how they forged a typewritten document to create a political scandal.  The document was on microfilm; this prevents authentication thru fingerprints, ink and paper composition, etc.  A picture of a thing is not the thing.<br />Another is the use of created gossip, and other dirty tricks, to harass the opposition.  Watergate was an example of this: Nixon's agents originally broke in to plant forged documents; they were caught when they broke in a second time to retrieve these false documents.<br />Perhaps the most important is &quot;how to use polling techniques to predetermine elections&quot;, a method used by our federal government &quot;both overtly and secretly&quot;.  Details are lacking in this book because this was still classified information.  But you can read more in the &quot;Propaganda At Work&quot; chapter.<br />The most revealing fact is how Sir William Stephenson used these efforts to gain commerce for his own business.	2000-10-25

He has not lost a criminal case in his forty-year career, nor a civil case before a jury in twenty-five years. He is the Earl Rogers of our generation. He refuses to represent banks, insurance companies, big business, big corporations, and the rich and famous (unless there is a public issue involved). <br />This book contains his comments on the trial, and much more on the justice system, and other events of the times. OJ Simpson first wanted him as his defense lawyer; he talked to R. Shapiro , and then viewed the trial. He has many comments on this event. The &quot;experts&quot; who never tried a murder case, never saw the inside of a jail, never worked in a courtroom, but were interviewed by the media. He compares them to professors of surgery who have never used a scalpel! Gerry Spence writes about many things that need more discussion. He says that the collective wisdom of a jury is superior to any one judge or lawyer; I think this would be due to the dialogues involved in summing up different viewpoints. He noted that the OJ Trial was used to attack the jury system, and the rights of all citizens; but this has failed too. <br />Gerry Spence believes that OJ was guilty; but the evidence (and the jury) said otherwise. He mentions the person who claimed to have seen OJ at 10:45 driving north on Bundy, and sold her story for $5000 (she needed the money). This witness was never used by the prosecution or the defense. Since OJ was talking on the intercom to the limo driver at this time, he could not have been the driver of the &quot;white vehicle&quot;. How reliable could this witness be? &quot;Too good to be true&quot;? The author doesn't discuss the possibility of &quot;false witnessing&quot; in this or other cases: e.g., &quot;Tom Mooney&quot; by Curt Gentry. <br />Gerry Spence notes that the jury system is a defense agains prosecutorial and judicial tyranny. If you have never read anyof his books, this is a good one to start with. Chapter 19 discusses the mass psychology of people on the guilt of OJ (and others). It is well worth reading. Stephen Singular's &quot;Legacy of Deception&quot; said &quot;all the blood evidence is suspect&quot;. I believe the socks and the glove were planted. If a guilty OJ could dispose of the bloody clothes, shoes, knives, etc. then the socks and glove would also be gone.	2000-10-23

In 1977 Frederick William Winterbotham published &quot;The Ultra Secret&quot;, about the decryption of the German Enigma systems. In 1978 &quot;Room 3603&quot; was reprinted. They all are important books about WW2, altho &quot;Room 3603&quot; starts in the 1930s and has important information about intelligence activities. Did you know that they knew how to forge typewritten documents in the 1930s? <br />This book tells about FWW's involvment in solving the Enigma encryption system. Like any good history, it is well written. I would recommend it highly to anyone. A later book tells more of his personal history in the 1930s. Working for the Air Ministry, he travelled to Germany to sell aircraft parts, and met many high Nazi officials. He was such a good friend of Goering that he was the only foreigner allowed to fly his airplane thru the Third Reich! He was one of the top British Nazi sympathizers at the time, until 1937: he was summoned to the Berlin Foreign Office, and given 48 hours to leave the country, &quot;or else&quot;. They finally discovered that FWW really worked for Military Intelligence!	2000-10-20

He doesn't say why this was done now, or the purpose of the grant.  But this book is important for two new facts.<br />The first edition that I saw in June 1997 had a picture of W.C. in 1935: blond hair, mustache, and about 145 pounds.  Compare it to the 1948 picture: bald, gray hair, and about 300 pounds.  Do they look like the same person?  When Alger Hiss said he didn't recognize the name of the person in the 1949 picture, that appears to have been true.  W.C. also used a false name at the time.<br />Another is the statement that W.C. dropped out to the Communist Party around 1929 during the purge of the Lovestone faction; he then soon rejoined.  I suspect he was recruited as a double agent, and sent back to get information about their activities.  That would be why he dropped out permanently during the 1937 purges; a double agent would be targeted by Stalin's secret service.  This explains why he was available as a false witness to destroy A.H. (a victim of Byzantium intrigue?).<br />Why is W.C.'s testimony false?  As a spy involved in illegal activity, he would have spent little time with his sources.  Any random surveillance could have ledt to his investigations and arrest.  He could not have spent so much time together as he later testified.  This is just my opinion.  But events in the news tell how information is passed in empty cigarette packs, etc. so there is no human contact involved when passing information.<br />After W.C. met high State Dept. officials and accused A.H. of being a secret Communist in 1939, no action was taken.  Could Hiss, like F.W. Winterbotham, had job duties that were not part of his job description?<br />Some people seemed to be impressed by the testimony that recollected details of the Hiss' room furnishings from ten years before; doesn't that show a well-rehearsed and well-researched testimony?  How many people could perform this trick without outside help?	2000-10-16

Goldberg is the Deputy District Attorney of Los Angeles County.  He presented the bulk of the forensic and scientific evidence, and tells the story of the prosecution of OJ Simpson, one of the &quot;most extraordinary events in legal history&quot;.<br />He says that the prosecution chose the best available option in virtually every major tactical decision, and how each decision made sense in the context of the trail as a whole.  He did reread the transcript to write the book, unlike the unfounded criticisms of an outrageous author.<br />Hank explains why the jury said &quot;not guilty&quot;.  You can take this all with a tablespoon of salt!  He claims that &quot;the jury did not consider the prosecution's evidence&quot; because they delivered their verdict in less than four hours.  If he can lie about this, can he believed about the rest?  Any jury that is not convinced of the prosecution's case will come to a quick acquittal.<br />Hank M. Goldberg should discard his sour grape and take an objective look at the prosecution, as in Chapter 39.  They made a list of things that proved  OJ guilty, such as: &quot;they took the Bentley, not the Bronco&quot;, &quot;he was seen outside at night ... entering the house&quot;, &quot;the gloves are twice as expensive as average men's gloves&quot;, &quot;the motive for the killing was rage&quot;, &quot;no evidence of theft or burglary&quot;, &quot;the victims did not scream&quot;, &quot;little evidence that Nicole resisted&quot;, &quot;Simpson forgot to set the security alarm&quot;, &quot;staring out the window when others were sleeping&quot;, &quot;one of the first people he calls is Kato&quot;.

(Solve the Crime)	The author is a retired chemistry professor who wrote many textbooks on chemistry. He had been interested in the Borden Murders for decades. After he retired, he began his research by reading the microfilmed Fall River newspapers from that time, and other sources. His book is his solution to the mystery; but you can &quot;come to your own conclusions&quot;. <br />The index has an entry for &quot;Simpson trial&quot;, but not one for &quot;Eagan, Ellan&quot;. His sources do not list Edmund Pearson's 1935 book (which is not generally available); it was the first book to renew interest in this unsolved crime. The book contains some reproductions from those newspapers, but some of the photographs are of low quality. He imagined a &quot;simple logical explanation&quot; for the missing note to Abby. In Chapter 14 he created a new theory: Andrew was killed first, then Abby! This goes against all known facts of the case, and the testimony of those who were present. He did not explain the purpose of his theory; could it have been caused by a more recent event where the time of death could be calculated by the fresh red liquid blood of the victims? The author attempted a solution to the mystery; I think he should have done more research. <br />Arnold R. Brown's book is still the best solution; he did more research, and had the hometown advantage. A number of minor spelling mistakes suggest that this book was rushed to publication.	2000-10-02

Knox was plucked from obscurity for the OJ trial. This book  tells about his experience as a juror, until he was  removed because of an  unreported arrest (charges were dismissed). He argues against the  sequestering of a jury (unless its for their own physical safety), and  tells of the problems that ensued.  (Sounds like that Survivor TV  show?)<br />The most harmful event was how he was downgraded and reduced in  pay after being selected for the jury.  Can't Federal Express  correct this  injustice?  <br />&quot;If all the jurors were of the same color, there would  be squabbles about hair color.  If all had the same hair color, there would  be clashes between those who wore glasses and those who didn't.&quot;   Putting a lot of strangers together causes strains and conflict.   <br />California then rushed a new law restricting jurors from selling their  story.  A Court case resulted in an injunction, and this book was  published.  Its an interesting book, but overtaken by events.  After  hearing the Prosecution's case (March 1995) he predicted that there would  not be a full jury at the end, and OJ would be found guilty.

Stinnett served in the Navy during World War II, then worked for  three decades as a photographer for an Oakland CA newspaper (navy base  there).  Around 1986 he began his research into the events preceding Pearl  Harbor.<br />Searching through piles of documents, he found a paper written in  1940 by a Lt.Commander (later Admiral).  This listed the things that had to  be done to provoke a war with Japan.  For example: &quot;station the fleet  at Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;declare the North Pacific an open, unpatrolled  sea&quot;, etc.  After the actions listed  were done, Pearl Harbor was  attacked and we were in the war.  Does anybody believe that we could have  stayed out?<br />Some now claim that this was not guaranteed.  But the Govt.  knew things, particularly that declaring war with Japan would bring in   Germany and Italy.  They were not fooled by the trick where the radiomen  from warships were kept in port so their &quot;fist&quot; would be  recognized.  Radios then were built with discrete parts (tubes, condensor,  resistors) whose minute differences were analyzed with an oscilloscope!   They knew something was up.<br />The objection of some people seems to be that  it &quot;wasn't proved&quot;, as if they expect a videotaped confession.   They can read other books on the subject of breaking the Japanese codes.   Note that the carrier fleet was kept out of Pearl Harbor, but the old (coal  burning?) warships were lined up as they were at Otranto.<br />Curt Gentry's  &quot;J. Edgar Hoover, the Man and the Myth&quot; told how in July 1941  British Intelligence (Ian Fleming and Dusko Popov) knew of plans for  attacking Pearl Harbor.  So somebody knew.	2000-08-10

Books	5	10	15	N	N	The First Break into the Investigation	This was one of the first books published about the crime.  When the synopsis was turned over to the LAPD his cover was blown and he could not  continue his investigation.  His source was well informed, the results from  the trial showed this.<br />The following may provide a short review of the  case.<br />The testimony of the two witnesses who cannot lie says that O.J.  Simpson is not guilty of the murders.  The autopsy of Nicole Brown found  blood and flesh under her fingernails; the blood type did not match O.J.  Simpson (or Ron Goldman or Nicole Brown).  Ron Goldman worked out and  practiced karate a couple of times a week, he played tennis, and walked to  work.  At 25 he was in prime physical shape; his hands showed bruises from  punching someone in the face and head more than once.  O.J. Simpson had no  scratches or bruises on his face or hands or body after the murders; he  could not have been a lone murderer.<br />The newspapers reported that when  the victims were found after 12:15 AM their red blood was trickling down  the sidewalk.  The color photographs printed in the National Enquirer  showed the bodies covered in red blood.  This means they were freshly  killed, around 11:30 PM, because their blood would be black and clotted if  dead for over an hour (as in the Borden murders).  Since the limousine  driver picked up O.J. Simpson at 11 PM he could not have been present at  the murders.  This proves him innocent of murder.<br />The O.J. Simpson case  received more publicity absolutely and relatively than the impeachment of  the President, or even the Oklahoma City bombing.  The National Association  of Editors and Publishers has never explained why.  You could ask the rumor  mongers on talk radio why they were told to publicize and prejudge this  case before the facts came out at the trial, and why some continue to  ignore these facts.  I think this is more than the gossip of idle tongues.   This case could become a textbook example in the use of propaganda by the  news media.<br />The book &quot;Killing Time&quot; by D. Freed and R. Briggs,  which covers this case, also tells about the &quot;Black Dahlia&quot; crime  which was never solved even after the murderer confessed!  Will the  Brown-Goldman murders forever remain an unsolved mystery?<br />Logically and  legally a person is considered innocent until proven guilty.  If not found  guilty, the accused is innocent.  People do not always understand or accept  this in all cases.  But a jury is always told to wait until all the  testimony is given before deciding on a verdict.  Many people will form an  opinion when they hear the first news, and ignore newer facts.	2000-08-07

In 1983 she was the first resignation of conscience from the  Reagan-Bush Administration.  &quot;Their guiding principles were that  loyalty to a royalist version of the Presidency was more important than the  Constitution, and that the truth was a 'problem' to be solved.&quot;<br />She  began to investigate the 1980 deal between the Reagan-Bush team and the  Iran: if the Iranians held their Americans captive until Reagan was  President, they would be better rewarded.  And they were!  Releasing the  captives in October 1980 would have given President Carter a boost in the  polls, and re-election in November.<br />Her book is filled with a many  details, and their references.  It lacks any pictures of the individuals  involved; there is no index, which lessens its use as a reference book  (deliberate?).<br />Chapter X, &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; tells of her  attempts to break through the censorship of Network Television.  The  Congressional Committee that investigated the selling of arms to Iran also  refused to look into anything that occurred before 1984.  No reason was  ever given.<br />Barbara Honegger was first to write an excellent book on the  subject.  She noted that Richard Allen was also involved in the 1968 affair  where Nixon's people tried to sabotage the American-Vietnamese talks in  Paris.  That trick also worked.  If truce was declared in 1968, only 22,000  would have died, not 33,000 more.<br />But the real, unreported scandal of  1980 was the sabotage of the Desert One rescue attempt.  Helicopters were  sent out over the desert without air filters; the sand and dust soon ruined  their engines.  Also, no backup or reserves were sent on this critical  mission.  The failure of this rescue mission prevented the rest of the plan  from being carried out.  Its success would surely have resulted in  President Carter's re-election.  Some think that the military-industrial  complex was amply rewarded by the greatly increased spending of the  Reagan-Bush administration.<br />Yet some of this arms buildup was not for our  forces.  The author notes that the arms sold to Iran came from the Reforger  stores, which were only to be used in repelling a Soviet Bloc invasion.   But could this scenario have been only a fantasy used to justify increased  military spending?<br />Did the US encourage Iraq to attack Iran?  Did we then  sell arms to both sides?  What was the effect of all this in the end?  Fomenting wars to sell arms to both sides, and to mediate a &quot;balance  of power&quot;?  Isn't this what put a former Empire into world-wide  disrepute before its demise?	2000-08-07

The book provides an analysis of the background of the Bill  of Rights and of current legal understanding of each of its provisions.   &quot;The people of the United States, aided by a persistent James Madison  and by traditions of freedom&quot; supported both the Constitution and the  Bill of Rights&quot;.<br />The theory that the Second Amendment vests only a  collective right to bear arms (state militias) would only mean that  soldiers are allowed to bear arms - which doesn't need a Constitutional  Amendment for that!  The history of the last two centuries shows that this  is an individual right.  To &quot;keep and bear arms&quot; refers to  individuals; soldiers' weapons are government property.  No &quot;National  Guard&quot; soldier can keep his arms - that would be &quot;theft of  Government Property&quot;.<br />The book explains how the Bill of Rights had  its origins in centuries old laws and customs, and Colonial  experiences.<br />Refer also to William Weir's &quot;A Well Regulated Militia:  The Battle Over Gun Control&quot; for more information.	2000-07-28

A few years later another revolt overthrew the Prince, and the Republic  was re-established.  But Machiavelli was out of a job again; the Republic  refused him because of his collaboration with the Prince (who was put into  power after the Holy League invaded the Republic).  Machiavelli's death  left his family penniless; his son published what had been a private letter  to earn money.  &quot;The Prince&quot; has been in continual publication  for the last five centuries.<br />The reason is the brilliance of his writing;  he wrote what many knew to be the truth.  His book is descriptive, not  prescriptive; it describes what rulers have done, and explains the results  of their actions.  Most people instinctively choose &quot;the lesser  evil&quot;; Machiavelli was the first to clearly define this  choice.<br />Machiavelli's books were well-read though out the 18th century.   His claim that &quot;Rome fell because it depended on auxiliaries&quot; is  true, but that is more effect than cause.  His works were well- known to  those who wrote the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the  Bill of Rights.<br />While addressed to a ruler, it should be read by many  people to understand their rulers.  &quot;Watch what I do, not what I  say&quot; could have been said by one of Machiavelli's  contemporaries.<br />The most notable thing about this book is Machiavelli's  devotion to a republican form of government, contrary to his reputation as  a tool of despotism.  Or could that be a form of censorship?  He did not  claim &quot;the end justifies the means&quot; as a general rule, or a  license for the powerful, altho some will read it that way.<br />Just as the  feudalsystem survives today thru patronage and &quot;politics&quot;  (really &quot;personal relationships&quot;), so too the examples cited by  Machiavelli will always be relevant to &quot;Western  Civilization&quot;.<br />Machiavelli says that a citizen army is superior to  mercenaries (professionals) or auxiliaries (foreign troops).  Does the  history of the last 250 years prove his claim?  I wonder what he would say  about our government's policy of using a professional army and disarming  the citizens?<br />(This is based on the &quot;Penguin Classics&quot; version  translated by George Ball.)	2000-07-06

The  &quot;tattooing&quot; marks on Robert Kennedy's right ear prove that he was  shot in the right rear of his head by a gun held about 2 inches from  behind.   Yet Sirhan was no closer than 4-5 feet from his front.  He thinks  a better attorney would have gotten him off.<br />Both of the above cases had  political effects that continue to affect us to this day.  Dr. Wecht was a  consultant to the movie &quot;JFK&quot; by Oliver Stone.<br />Dr. Wecht is  from the Pittsburgh area, was involved in politics, and held various  elected (Democratic) offices as Penna. Coroner and County Commissioner....   <br />The book tells of some of the other interesting local  cases that he was involved with.  It is entertaining and educational.<br />The  book is worth reading because of the chapters on JFK and RFK, and the other  stories are educational and entertaining.  He also consulted with the Los  Angeles medical examiner who was the model for &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, a  usually entertaining TV series from the early 80's.  (I think it was one of  the few that realistically showed the &quot;personality conflicts&quot;  that occur between allied departments, and because of budgets.)	2000-06-29

Perhaps they couldn't find any in these places, at least none that could be printed by  their publications.<br />The book lacks pictures of any of the people  mentioned; that's a drawback in case you might see them again.<br />The book  tells about the half-dozen reporters who were responsible for the many  claims that are now known to be false; the small groups that generated the  false claims; and the cabal of rich Clinton haters who paid for their  lies.<br />After his mother died of lung cancer (a life-long cigarette smoker)  the Clinton Administration prosecuted Big Tobacco like no other President  before him.  Note that Faircloth and Helms, who picked Starr, were from  North Carolina; a state heavily influenced (if not controlled) by Big  Tobacco.<br />The book should have been longer.  It didn't tell about Monica's  step-father: an advertising executive whose biggest client is Big Tobacco.   Or why he got Monica an intern's job.  Given her past history, was she used  as an unwitting double agent to entrap Clinton?  Also, her apartment in  Washington was next to Bob Dole's.  Can anyone believe that to be a mere  coincidence?<br />On page 384 (the notes for Chapter Seven) [p.108] they write  &quot;on the CIA's role in destabilizing the government of New York&quot;.   Shouldn't that read &quot;Great Britain&quot;?<br />Back in the early 1960s,  when JFK experience a policy failure that was followed by increased ratings  in the polls, he said &quot;Its just like with Eisenhower, the bigger the  foul-up, the higher the ratings&quot;.  Clinton's growing support in 1998  showed that the people still rallied to a besieged President.  I wonder if  Macchiavelli addressed this phenomenon?	2000-06-27

Edgar Hoover in the Assassination of President Kennedy	Books	5	47	59	N	N	The Final Chapter on the JFK Assassination	This book is one of the most important books that I have read on the JFK assassination - and I have read over a dozen since 1964.  It is the &quot;final chapter&quot; as it provides the &quot;big picture&quot;  answer.<br />It uses the information that came out since the 1970s.  The  Congressional Investigation in 1977 resulted in a number of books  afterwards.<br />If you read Curt Gentry's &quot;J. Edgar Hoover, The Man and  the Myth&quot; you would know that Hoover had been filing false expense  reports for decades, and built up a small fortune.  (He stayed at hotels  and ate at restaurants for free, then collected expenses as if he had  paid.)  If he ever left office, he would have been convicted for fraud, and  died in jail.  He had no other option but to die in office, since he could  not (or would not) get a &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card.  (The  Watergate Burglary came apart when one of the burglars did not get this, as  promised.)<br />You should know that this GOOJF card is not just an invented  scene in the movie &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;.  Back in the 1940s  the four-star General who headed the CIA went to President Truman with a  complaint about an assignment: it clearly crossed the line into a felony.   But Harry just wrote out a signed but undated full Presidential Pardon!   Read the biography of Allen Dulles, &quot;Gentleman Spy&quot; for more  details.<br />And LBJ's crony was implicated in various frauds, some of which  were said to be in complicity with organized crime.  LBJ was likely to be  dumped as vice-president, and would also face prosecution, disgrace, and  jail.<br />Mark North has collected a number of letters that passed between  LBJ and JEH.  Surely no one would expect either of them to put their plans  in writing?	2000-06-20

The &quot;Harvard Perjury&quot; was the testimony preceded by  &quot;I believe that ...&quot; the old hatchet was the murder weapon.  The  common sense jury knew that the hatchet head was SAWN off, not broken  off.<br />The chapter on rumors carries the full text of the  anonymous letter  from Albany (most likely Joseph Carpenter?) sent to both the Prosecutor and  the Marshall.  The misspelled &quot;Bordon&quot; name is just a sample of  &quot;plausible denial&quot;, in case somebody (with a hatchet) came to  talk to him.  The letter that was later found on a Rome NY street pointing   to J. Carpenter was a way to get even; somebody connected with the case  wasn't fooled.<br />This book is a very good complementary to Arnold R.  Brown's &quot;final chapter&quot; on the case - as good a solution as you  can find after a century.<br />Edward Radin's 1961 book re-investigated the  case, and talked to some contemporaries who knew Lizzie.  He was the first  to show Pearson's biased reporting, and had his own solution (based on his  own experiences as a crime reporter).<br />The 1973 book by Robert Sullivan,  lawyer and judge, provides another point of view.  His opinion that  &quot;there was enough evidence to convict&quot; shows prejudgment of the  case.  His book  quotes Judge Justin Dewey's charge to the jury, as true  and important today as a century ago.  He interviewed Abby Borden Whitehead  Potter, Abby's niece (and Godchild?).<br />The most important thing about this  case was the condition of the blood of the victims.  Red and liquid for  freshly-killed Andrew, black and clotted for Abby (predeceased for over an  hour). Think about that in a more recent case!	2000-05-05

This book is important for solving a century-old mystery, based on the available evidence. It sets a good example for any other non-writer to follow.<br />A R Brown was born and raised in Fall River. He retired to Florida, and met Lewis Peterson (also from Fall River). When the subject of Lizzie Borden came up, Lewis said his father-in-law Henry Hawthorne knew the real killer. Hawthorne's mother-in-law Ellan Eagan passed by the Borden house that morning. <br />Before Henry Hawthorne died in 1978 he left notebooks filled with his memories of that event. A R Brown read them, then checked those facts for historical verification. His book is the result of his investigation.  The &quot;Acknowledgments&quot; list the many people who helped with the book, which provides the &quot;best evidence&quot; for its solution to this famous unsolved mystery.<br />Little or no documentation is available, as the author stated, for any further proof. He noted that there was a work stoppage, which put pressure on the local establishment to find a solution. The Mellen House Gang would not leave documents for their actions in 1892, as with most current politicians. (We still don't have an official legal solution to the JFK assassination.)<br />The book &quot;Forty Whacks&quot; provides complementary information on the events of the time. Note the &quot;anonymous&quot; letter from Albany (Joseph Carpenter?) who seemed to know something about the crime. Like today, people may know things but do not wish to get involved with powerful authorities who have their own agenda.<br />I think there may have been more information left out of the book. <br />One important but little known fact mentioned in this book is the condition of the blood for a freshly killed body (red and liquid) compared to one dead for over an hour (black and clotted). Think about that in a more recent double murder case.	2000-04-19
