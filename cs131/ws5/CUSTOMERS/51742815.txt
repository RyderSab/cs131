US	51742815	R15TQPRRPSUXDB	1880410230	787121584	A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) -- 2000 Edition	Books	3	8	8	N	Y	Outdated as of September 2005	I feel that it is important to mention that I have had little project management experience.  I purchased the CD-ROM version of this book in preparation to take the CAPM exam given by PMI.  The 2000 version of the PMBOK guide is obsolete as of September 2005.  The PMI exams are now based on the Third edition of this guide.<br /><br />I found this book to be as exciting to read as the Yellow Pages, though I will admit that if I were an experienced project manager, I would find the book much better reading.  The book has a simple layout, with three sections.<br /><br />The first section is on project management framework.  This section is comprised of three chapters that discuss appropriate definitions, parts of a project, and processes used in project management.<br /><br />The second section is the main portion of the book.  Section 2 covers the project management knowledge area.  Comprised of 9 chapters, each chapter covers a knowledge area.  These knowledge areas are Project Integration Management, Project Scope Management, Project Time Management, Project Cost Management, Project Quality Management, Project Human Resources Management, Project Risk Management, and Project Procurement Management.<br /><br />The final section is a series of appendices that I did not find applicable to the passing the PMP or CAPM exam.<br /><br />Unfortunately, everything that is on the certification exams is not in this book.  While the PMBOK creates an excellent framework for the proper techniques to use in project management, this book alone is not sufficient to pass the certification exams.  I would highly recommend the \\"PMP Exam Prep by Rita Mulcahy\\" if you are going to take either of the certification exams.<br /><br />This book was an incredibly painful read.  The information provided is in a very uninteresting list format similar to an outline used to write speeches and papers.  If you are new to the world of project management and are looking for a guide, while this book is necessary to manage projects effectively, there are probably better books to get started with.  I would recommend this book to experienced project managers or people going for the PMP or CAPM certifications.his book is necessary to manage projects effectively, there are probably better books to get started with.

I've been yelled at by a tourist for clapping and making noise to alert bears to my presence while hiking because they were concerned they would not see a bear with all the noise I was making (well, that is the point).  With my experience with how dumb tourists can be in Alaska, I was interested to find out stories of tourists and others in Yellowstone.<br /><br />This was a book that I had mixed feelings about.  The first three chapters were the best.  These chapters were on deaths from hot springs, death by park animals (except bears), and death by bears.  The remaining 22 chapters range from death by poison gasses to death by vehicles.  I felt these chapters while factual, were not very exciting.<br /><br />Overall, I found the book decently researched, but overall I found it kind of depressing.  I found the first chapter on the hot springs quite horrific (especially when some of the victims were young kids like my children and a couple involved dogs that just wanted to go swimming).  As I read the book, I kept thinking the victims were someone's children, spouse, SO, friends, or other loved one.  With this being said, I did find the book respectful and tasteful.<br /><br />This is a book I think people can take a lesson from.  Nature is real and while it should be enjoyed, people need to be reminded that it can be dangerous.	2005-09-03

Since I was old enough to get my Hunter's Safety Certificate, I have been actively hunting Whitetail deer in Wisconsin and Sitka Blacktail deer in Alaska.  After 16 years of hunting deer, I wanted to pursue another big game species.  I decided that the Pronghorn would be my next pursuit.  Despite extensive hunting experience in Southeast Alaska and Wisconsin, I did not have the slightest clue how to hunt Pronghorn.  I saw this book and thought it would be a great place to begin to learn.<br /><br />I would summarize this book as a cross between \\"everything you ever wanted to know about Pronghorn\\" and a \\"how-to\\" book on hunting.  The book is divided into four sections.  The first section, Understanding Pronghorns, covers biological and social information about Pronghorns.  This section talks about eating habits, travel habits, basic history of Pronghorn populations, etc.  The second section is entitled \\"Hunting Equipment.\\"  Not surprising, this section covers equipment needed to hunt Pronghorn including rifles, optics, clothing, and other items for muzzleloaders and bowhunters.  The third section, Pronghorn Hunting, discusses various hunting strategies such as decoying, blinds, spot and stalk, as well as how to field judge Pronghorn.  The final section, Hunts to Remember, is a collection of a few stories by each of the co-authors.<br /><br />Parts of the book were extremely useful.  I thought the section on field judging Pronghorns was very valuable.  The section on hunting clothing is also very handy for the novice Pronghorn hunter.  A majority of the book simplifies Pronghorn hunting with rifles to simply be glassing a prairie, see a Pronghorn, stalk it, and shoot it.  For close range weapons, find a place Pronghorns will go (a fence crossing or a water hole), set up a blind, and wait.  While some other methods are talked about (I thought the cow story was great.  I felt like building one myself.), a huge chunk of the book is spent talking about the two methods I mentioned.  To the authors credit, while they make the hunting process sound simple, they do convey the point that a lot of the time, a Pronghorn will spot you and run all the way to the next county before the hunter can even think of shooting, letting the reader know it is much more difficult than it sounds.<br /><br />Personally, I felt the authors or editors could have cut out a lot of the data in the \\"Understanding Pronghorns\\" section of the book.  I think the book could have highly benefited by discussing how to find a place to hunt, or rules on using BLM land.  As the majority of Pronghorn hunters are from out of state, I think some elaboration on preparing and transporting the meat and a trophy head and cape over long distances taking a day or two would have been highly beneficial as well.<br /><br />The book was an easy read.  Despite its shortcomings, the book is still an acceptable place to start learning for the novice Pronghorn hunter.  An experienced Pronghorn hunter may get a tidbit or two of information, but I would not expect they would learn much.  Happy Hunting!I mentioned.

Despite partaking in one of the biggest heists in American history, Henry Hill should have been another anonymous person that people would not have guessed was a gangster.  Immortalized in the movie Goodfellas, Hill's claim to fame, was not the infamous Lufthansa heist, but rather ratting out multiple associates in the world of organized crime and evaporating into the federal witness protection program.<br /><br />Wiseguy is an easy to read book that delves into the world of organized crime.  Many movies have shown mafia life to be easy and luxurious.  This book portrays the people in the mafia as extremely hard working individuals, many of whom have real jobs or own their own legitimate businesses, who just happen to have talents for hustling, conning, or violence.  The book provides intimate details on Hill's journey through the world of organized crime, starting with a part-time job at a cab stand after school, rising to the heights of stealing millions through participating in robberies and hijackings, then finally how his world rapidly disintegrate after creating a large narcotics empire.  A better story could not have been made up.  The life of Henry has everything, love, deceit, murder, drugs, corruption, and mystery.<br /><br />Like most books turned movies, I found Wiseguy to be better than the movie, but not by much (both were incredible).  There were several topics covered in the book that were not discussed in detail in the movie (personally, I found the section on Henry's prison life to be quite interesting, but it is not covered in a lot of detail in the movie).  The only complaint I had about this book is that some of the chapters seemed to be a little long, giving the reader no good place to stop and take a break.  If you are interested in organized crime or true crime, I would highly recommend this book.  However, the book and the movie are almost exactly the same.  For this reason, if you only pick up a few books a year, I would recommend watching Goodfellas instead.nized crime or true crime, I would highly recommend this book.

US	51742815	R2D8S8602CXYB7	0140390839	474714897	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Adventuresome Tale About Being Young	I believe that one of the factors that makes a piece of literature or even a movie a masterpiece is how well the reader can relate to the story.  This is definitely a book everyone can relate to.<br /><br />The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a literary masterpieces, written in 1876 by the famous author Mark Twain.  Tom Sawyer is a mischievous young boy who lives in the small town on the Mississippi River called St. Petersburg.  The story line is simple, the book reads like a biography or a memoir of a summer in Tom Sawyer's life.<br /><br />Tom Sawyer seems to be the precursor of and the template for misfit kids such as Dennis the Menace, Malcolm in the Middle, and Calvin and Hobbs. What makes this story great is that Tom Sawyer represents everything that is great about childhood.  The book is filled with Tom's adventures playing pirates and war with his friend Joe Harper.  Tom has a trusted friend, Huck Finn, who few of the adults approve of.  The book is filled with ideas of how the world works, such as how pirates and robbers work, that are so innocent, they could only come from a child.  It is a story filled with action, adventure, ingenious ideas, love, and schoolyard politics.  The whole story is seemingly a complication of what people did or wish they did during their childhood.<br /><br />The book is a little difficult to read at first.  Personally, it takes me a little while to get used to the 19th century dialect in the book.  Other than referring to persons of African decent in derogatory terms (which I'm sure uses terms even young children already know), the book would be an enjoyable read for people of all ages.  I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to feel young again, if just for a few hundred pages.	2005-07-13

I am not very interested in the war itself, but rather the stories of the people who fight the wars.<br /><br />This book is a biography of Carlos Hathcock.  Being born after the Vietnam War, the name typically would have meant nothing to me except I ran into the son of one of Hathcock's \\"trainees\\" and Hathcock's name always stuck with me.<br /><br />Hathcock was just another Marine in Vietnam.  He was an elite marksman with a rifle, yet this was ignored and upon arriving in Vietnam, Hathcock was assigned to a desk job in an MP battalion as a watch commander.  After serving as an MP for a while, a \\"freak\\" occurrence required Hathcock to use his marksmanship skills to take out an enemy shooter who had attacked the base.  The enemy solider was to be taken out at his village.  From there, Hathcock's career rapidly progresses into becoming a sniper.  The book covers Hathcock's legendary career as a sniper.  During two tours of duty, Hathcock racked up almost 100 confirmed kills and numerous other unconfirmed kills.  Hathcock became so good at what he did, the enemy offered a $20,000 bounty to the person who killed Hathcock or his partner.  The enemy formulated several special groups and executed some brilliant strategies to try and take out the \\"white feather\\".<br /><br />My meager words could never do justice to the author.  Reading the book is like watching a poetic war drama.  The eloquence the author uses in this book is mesmerizing.  The scenes are described in such vivid detail, I felt like I was there, hearing bullets buzz above my head, listening to my heart pounding, watching the blood of an unfortunate soldier soak into the earth, as I see the person next to me squeeze the trigger to silence the enemy soldier's rifle.  The stories in the book range from humorous, victorious, heroic, then to disheartening.  To the people who are unfamiliar with Hathcock's story, the end of Hathcock's days in Vietnam is shocking, but not surprising.  I was most impressed by the humanity Hathcock expressed.  He never looked at it as killing an enemy solder, rather he saw his job as saving the lives of American soldiers.  I also found some of the stories in the book familiar, as I recognized bits and pieces I've seen in movies over the years (probably the most well-known being the \\"scope\\" episode, which is in the movie \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".  I'm guessing this is based on Hathcock's story).<br /><br />This is by far one of the best books I have read that cover the life of a soldier.  I would highly recommend this book to people interested in the life of a sniper or are interested in soldiers of the Vietnam War.Hathcock's days in Vietnam is shocking, but not surprising.

The main idea behind \\"The Garbage Project\\" is to gain information about society by analyzing garbage patterns in various locations.<br /><br />Despite being a book about garbage, the contents of the book are quite diverse.  The book is divided into 4 parts.  The first section, An Introduction to the Garbage Project, gives the background of \\"The Garbage Project\\", why it started, what they do, and what they hope to accomplish.  This section also discusses how anthropologists use garbage to learn about ancient civilizations.  The second section, The Landfill Excavations, discuss the basic theories of landfills, how the team takes samples from landfills, and discusses why biodegradation does not work in landfills.  The third section, Interlude: Diapers and Demographics, I found to be highly entertaining.  This section has a fascinating chapter on estimating the population of a neighborhood (as well as sex and age) based on the garbage collected from this neighborhood (a study done to initially help the Census Bureau).  This section is also filled with useless information such as \\"There is a link between owning a cat and reading \\"The National Enquirer\\"\\".  There is also a detailed discussion about disposable diapers in landfills.  The final section, Garbage and the Future, was the most educational by far.  This part discusses the serious shortcomings of citywide recycling programs and side effects people never hear about.  There are also discussions on alternate garbage disposal methods, such as high tech incinerators used to generate electricity, as well as several other attempts at using technology to turn garbage into a useful product.  The section and the book end with a chapter on reducing and addressing garbage disposal.<br /><br />I think this book will not be for everyone.  The book reads like a Master's Thesis at times, rather long and seems to ramble.  However, some parts of the book are exceptional (such as the chapter on recycling or \\"Closing the Loop\\") and are really an eye opener.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in Environmental Sciences.  Also, if you can manage to wade through pages of various scientific theories and facts, I'd highly recommend picking this book up!

However, this is one of those books that tell several stories.  This is a book on government bureaucracy, terrorism, a visionary to whom no one will listen, and a man who people love and despise at the same time.<br /><br />\\"The Man Who Warned America\\" is an excellent book on the life of John O'Neill, who was probably one of the FBI's best counterterrorism agents.  John O'Neill is a name that I had never heard before until this book.<br /><br />O'Neill would probably be no more memorable than any other FBI agent, except for a man named Osama Bin Laden.  O'Neill had partaken in the investigation of almost every America related terrorist event in recent history, including Oklahoma City, the USS Cole in Yemen, the embassy bombings in Africa, and the bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia.  Yet what made O'Neill noteworthy was the fact he fingered Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda as a terrorist threat to the United States in 1995, six years before the infamous attack on the World Trade Center.  However, just like a painter without a canvas, O'Neill was a man with an answer to a question no one had the foresight to ask, and no one would listen until it was too late.<br /><br />The book explores enigma and duality that is O'Neill's personal and professional life.  As an FBI agent, O'Neill was second to no one.  If it weren't for two indiscretions (one accidental, one the type of thing probably everyone does anyway), O'Neill might have made it to the top spot in the FBI.  The book also tells a different side of O'Neill, a womanizer, a chronic liar, and a person who seemingly had no regard for his financial future.  Yet, he was a caring father, an insecure mate, and a typical fun-loving American.<br /><br />The book also explores the government's role (or lack of one) in the bin Laden attacks on American interests.  While O'Neill tried to warn America about bin Laden, a scandal riddled Clinton administration seemingly did not want to put their reputation on the line over a terrorist unknown to the American public.  O'Neill's issues and frustration with government bureaucracy climaxes in Yemen, with the introduction of Ambassador Bodine.  Bodine is portrayed as a bully who symbolizes everything people hate in their government and in a person, whose actions could have cost further American casualties.<br /><br />I found the book to be an excellent read on the life of an FBI agent, terrorism, and how government bureaucracy might one day cost many people's lives.  Despite the complex and outrageous lifestyle of John O'Neill, I think he is a person who most can identify with on a personal level.  I think with the way O'Neill is portrayed, some people will find his actions heroic and some people will find him a despicable person.  I though the book was a little slow reading in the beginning, but overall it was excellent.  However, I think some people will hate the book because they hate the person.  I'd highly recommend the book to anyone interested in the life of an FBI agent or people interested in terrorism.andal riddled Clinton administration seemingly did not want to put their reputation on the line over a terrorist unknown to the American public.

Normally I am able to tell a person why I like a book or why I like a movie.  However, in this case, I am really not able to say why I thought this book was excellent.<br /><br />Requiem is a series of photos and stories from various wars in the Indochina region (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia mainly) from the 1950's to the 1970's.  Most of the photos were taken by photographers that lost their lives during the various conflicts.  The book reads like a magazine, a series of short stories about the region, the war, or about a deceased photographer augmented by photographs of the subject or by the subject.<br /><br />I was confused about my feelings about the pictures in the book.  I do not find any beauty in death, yet I found the photographs in the book are hauntingly beautiful.  The pictures in the beginning of the book show calm, surreal scenes from the region.  As the book progressed from the 1950's to the Vietnam war, the pictures became more destructive and consumed with death.  Some pictures were unbelievable such as the photo by Hiromichi Mine of the plane hit in midair by an artillery shell.  Other photos left images burned in my mind such as the photo of the last rights being given to Dixey Chapelle.<br /><br />After searching for a few days as to why I thought the book was beautiful, I decided on the following:  Personally, I have always been intrigued with war.  I was never fascinated with the violence much as I was with the people who fought it and why it was fought.  I've read a lot of first person accounts from various wars, but in the end, they were all stories.  I believe Requiem and its photos tell the story of the people on both sides as well as the civilians caught in the middle.  I thought it brought the concept of war out of the world of words on paper and into reality.  The people killed were no longer statistics in an encyclopedia, their pictures shows young people with fear in their eyes.  Like I mentioned before, it brought the soldiers from the world of words on paper to reality.  It showed soldiers helping one another, fighting, tired after the battle, and deceased.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book for people interested in the Indochina wars or people interested in the Vietnam War.  I think the book serves its purpose better in the hands of a mature audience, where people can look beyond the blood and violence to its hidden meanings.from the world of words on paper to reality.

However, I obtained a copy of this novel and I must say I was quite surprised.<br /><br />The story is about a former military intelligence officer turned investment banker named Trey Miller.  A former classmate of Trey's named Dennis Willingham is killed.  The police perform a half-hearted investigation, concluding that the death was drug related.  Trey begins to investigate the murder of his friend and cannot figure out if the Puerto Rican gang who Dennis bought drugs from killed him, or if it was the Russian Mafia for whom Dennis laundered money for.  The remainder of the book is a thrilling read of Trey's story of trying to find the murderer.  Trey sets the murderer up to be executed, but a pregnant woman who was in the wrong place at the wrong time spoils Trey's plan to execute the suspected killer in a park.  The book then goes into a suspenseful game of cat and mouse, with Trey after the killer, the killer after Trey, the rival criminal enterprise after Trey and the other criminal organization, the police after Trey, and Trey trying to return his kidnap victim to safety.<br /><br />I must say that the book description on Amazon does not do the book justice.  When I first read the book summary on Amazon, I thought the book was going to be terrible.  However, this is one of the greatest suspense thrillers I have read.  The book is not filled with \\"fluff\\" and gets right to the point, thus trimming the book down to a very quick reading 200 pages.<br /><br />The events of the book seem to be very believable with the exception of a few scenes.  In the park scene, a witness to the crime says that Trey throws a Kevlar wrap around the kidnap victim.  Personally, at a distance of greater than 5 feet, I cannot tell the difference between Kevlar and another thin cloth, such as Nylon.  Also in the same scene, Trey manages to conceal and transport a .50 caliber rifle to the top of an apartment building in a crowded city.  Rifles that big are heavy and usually on the large/long side compared to a \\"typical\\" hunting rifle.  Finally, I personally didn't care for the whole \\"life force\\" scene at the end of the book, but it wasn't enough to ruin the ending by any means.<br /><br />Despite a couple of unrealistic details and a few grammatical errors, the book was an excellent read.  The book starts off a little slow but picks up rapidly.  The ending is fast paced and very exciting.  I would highly recommend this novel for anyone who is looking for a fast-paced, on the edge of your seat suspense novel.  While I think this author is still fine-tuning his style somewhat, I definitely would not hesitate to read another book from this author.es that big are heavy and usually on the large/long side compared to a \\"typical\\" hunting rifle.

To be honest, I am not even sure where this book came from.  While I am not obese, I could stand to lose 20 pounds (I'm about 5'10 and around 200 pounds), so I figured I'd read through it.<br /><br />This is one of those books that I am not sure how to describe.  The book is a series of 40 weight loss stories.  The book reminds me a lot of a daytime talk show.  Each one of the people in this book had a story to tell.  Most of the stories were quite touching.  It was great to read real life people actually being able to go from obese to a healthy, attractive weight.  However, the book did read like an infomercial for Deal-A-Meal.<br /><br />Most of all, I was touched by the type of person Richard Simmons himself is.  After reading the book, I was of the opinion that Mr. Simmons is one of the few people in this world who will sacrifice his time, money, and travel to almost anywhere to help a complete stranger.  While I am sure Mr. Simmons has made millions from his fitness empire, I truly believe he is in it to help him and others with their weight.<br /><br />This is not a book I would recommend running out and buying unless you get a deal on it.  I did find the stories somewhat inspiring, but not overly inspirational (In all due fairness. I'm not sure if this is because my weight problems in life have been what I would call terrible).  After finishing the book, I did not have the urge to exercise and throw out any junk food in the house.  Rather, the book made me shrug my shoulders and say \\"that was interesting\\".	2005-05-31

A murder case required a witness or a \\"smoking gun\\".  Battered Child Syndrome was a term that was still just an idea in someone's mind.  These two facts meant that justice might never come for a three-year-old boy named Dennis Jurgens.<br /><br />\\"Death in White Bear Lake\\" is a meticulously researched story of Dennis Jurgens.  Dennis was adopted at the age of one and placed with a seemingly average family in White Bear Lake, Minnesota.  Despite scattered clues that the Jurgens' family may be unsuitable to have children, Dennis was placed in their apparently warm and loving home.  The decision proved fatal after Dennis fell down a flight of stairs leading to the basement.<br /><br />But is that what really happened?  The book does an excellent job telling the horrific story of how the system failed Dennis, as well as five other children adopted by this family.  It also tells of how politics in a small town as well as the way the laws worked in the 1960's almost prevented Dennis from ever getting justice as well as how people turned a blind eye to child abuse rather than standing up for the defenseless victims.  Finally, it tells the story of Jerry Sherwood, the natural mother of Dennis who has not seen him on over 20 years, only to find out he was allowed to die by the society who felt she could not provide the life that Dennis deserved.<br /><br />The book is meticulously researched and well written.  The book is so detailed that it seems that it was written as a movie script rather than a novel.  Sometimes the book felt more like reading a long news article.  I found the beginning of the book rather slow reading, to the point where I actually put the book down for awhile.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend the book to people interested in a sad story of true crime.  I am not sure if the paperback version contains the photographs in the center, but I would recommend not looking at the pictures until finishing the book.  The pictures actually will give away the ending of the book.pictures actually will give away the ending of the book. <br />	2005-04-26

Did you graduate college a decade ago and do not remember how to write an effective resume anymore?  How do I grab a recruiter's attention to get my foot in the door for an interview?<br /><br />I work in the telecommunications industry, which has been volatile over the last several years.  I looked at my resume one-day and realized that despite a great career history, my resume was rather plain and uninteresting.  I had long forgotten my classes on resume writing I was required to take in college 8 years ago.  I was looking for help in my professional writing ability.<br /><br />This book took my resume from boring to outstanding.  In all due fairness, I am not actively looking for work, so I am unable to comment on if the improved resume would help me get a job, but the book provided me with confidence.  The book provides invaluable tips on writing, interviewing, negotiating, as well as tips on making your life better through the jobs you choose.<br /><br />Monster Careers is one of the greatest comprehensive job guides I have written.  Monster Careers is divided into 4 parts, The New Job Search Basics, Preparing Your Search, Into the Marketplace, and Landing the job.<br /><br />The New Job Search Basics section discusses several general topics, such as thinking like a free agent, finding what type of job and environment you are looking for, what happens behind the scenes of a recruiter, and finding people who will help you find work.<br /><br />The Preparing your Job Search section was the most beneficial section in my opinion.  This section discusses planning a job search, gathering your information (the book calls it creating a job search portfolio), creating a sales pitch for yourself, and writing resumes and cover letters.<br /><br />Into the Market place discusses researching a prospective company to gain a competitive edge in an interview, finding and creating job opportunities, and creating a personal network.<br /><br />The last section, Landing the Job, discusses what to do in the job interview, negotiating salary and benefits, transitioning to a new job, and how to address special issues during a job search (such as criminal records, finding the first job, transitioning from military life, old age, etc..).<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this book to people like me, whose resume is plain and whose writing ability is average at best.  While I would not go as far as to say this should be a must read for all jobseekers, I will say that I personally found this book highly beneficial.nities, and creating a personal network. <br /> <br />The last section, Landing the Job, discusses what to do in the job interview, negotiating salary and benefits, transitioning to a new job, and how to address special issues during a job search (such as criminal records, finding the first job, transitioning from military life, old age, etc..). <br /> <br />I'd highly recommend this book to people like me, whose resume is plain and whose writing ability is average at best.

The book is a memoir of Corporal Buzz Williams, a Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) operator/gunner in the Marine Corps Reserves.  The book is a thorough summary of Cpl. Williams' experience in the Marine Corps reserves, mostly covering boot camp, MOS training, weekend drills, and deployment in Operation Desert Storm.<br /><br />The book gives a high level overview of Cpl. Williams' boot camp experience.  I found this section neat, but I have seen much more thorough accounts of boot camp in other places.  I thought the book really picked up after boot camp.  I had found few if any accounts of reservist life and life in modern warfare.  Cpl. Williams discusses the experience of MOS training, including the shortcomings of the training the military provided in LAV school.  The chapters on the weekend drills I thought were invaluable to a potential reservist.  This book is the first place I found an excellent, written account of what a training weekend is like.  Finally, the end of the book discussed what life during a modern war is like and what it is like to come home afterward.  The writing of Cpl. Williams is frank and discusses both the positives and negatives of military life and military procedures.<br /><br />The book is a quick and an easy read.  I would highly recommend this book to people considering potentially enlisting in the military reserves.  The book sheds a sobering light on reservist life that I thought really helped me see the military from another perspective.  I would also highly recommend this book to persons interested in military memoirs or life in the military.	2005-01-05

A year after this death, the boy's Mother (Tina) begins experiencing paranormal phenomena.  Suddenly, Tina gets a premonition that Danny is alive.  The rest of the book is a danger-laden journey, trying to determine if Danny is alive and if he is, where is he?<br /><br /> I felt that the overall plot of this book is very amateurish and it seems that it has been done in several of the fiction novels that I have read.  However, despite the conventional plot, I did feel that the book was awesomely suspenseful, even though the ending seemed appallingly predictable (especially the scene with the helicopter).<br /><br />The book is easy to follow and is a fast read.  As this book is just average, I'd recommend it to people who have nothing better to read or nothing better to do.  If you have the book lying around or if you can get it cheap, pick it up as it is a pretty good story.  However, this is not a book that I would recommend people run out and purchase a copy as soon as they can.	2004-12-18

The book title sounds like an infomercial that I would see at 3 AM in the morning.  However, common sense told me that this book would not contain the road map to financial independence.  I was intrigued however.  To borrow a line from the book \\"The Wealthy Barber\\", \\"if you want to learn to do something right, watch someone who does it successfully.\\"  Who better to learn about money than \\"The Donald\\" himself.<br /><br />I will begin by saying that I think the title of this book is misleading, but I do feel the book is somewhat useful.  The book is not a roadmap to get rich, but rather a collection of philosophies and tidbits of advice on how to survive and succeed in the business world.  The book is divided into six sections:  The Donald J. Trump School of Business and Management, Your personal Apprenticeship, \\"Money, Money, Money, Money\\", The Secrets of Negotiation, The Trump Lifestyle, and Inside the Apprentice.<br /><br />The first chapter on the \\"School of Business\\" is inspiring and useful for aspiring managers.  The chapter provides common sense tips that people should already know after being in the business world a couple of years, but sometimes forget.  The second chapter on \\"Your Personal Apprenticeship\\" seems to have some good advice on people new to the business world, new to their current field, or considering exiting their comfort zone.  Once again, mostly common sense tips that people sometimes forget.<br /><br />Starting with the third chapter, the book rapidly falls apart.  The chapter on \\"Money\\" covers a mere 12 pages (including some suggestions on personal finance, not just business finance).  There are people who dedicate an entire lifetime of constant learning to cover one aspect of money, personal finance, and business finance.  I found it appalling that only 12 pages were dedicated to the subject.  The Negotiation chapter was better, but still on the weak side.  The chapter on the \\"Trump Lifestyle\\" was useful, but only because it showed what a day in a billionaire like Trump is like.  It is not fun and games.  The final chapter on The Apprentice was pretty useless and is hardly worth comment.<br /><br />While I hate to criticize an author, especially an author who has proven himself in the world of business, this book was average at best (and that would be insulting a lot of \\"average\\" books).  The book seems to over advertise Trump's properties and The Apprentice.  Much of the information is common sense or learned by people who have been in the world of management for a few years.  This book might be useful to young people new to the world of management (though some of the information could backfire in the hands of an overzealous, naïve person).

In the end, I was somewhat disappointed in my purchase.  The book is a dazzling compilation of photos of caribou.  People used to viewing whitetail deer photos in books and magazines may not appreciate the photos.  While this book is short and it seems there are not a lot of pictures, the pictures in the book are splendid.  Due to the nomadic nature of caribou and the amount of ground they cover, it would not surprise me if it took a decade to get all the photos to put this 80 page book together.<br /><br />While I could never express the beauty of the pictures in this book, I was disappointed in the text in the book.  I was hoping for some details about the life and habits of caribou.  The book does discuss the general life of caribou a little bit, but most of the text is a collection of short stories about event the author/photographer saw to describe the accompanying photos in the book.  The stories were okay and were a decent accompaniment to the photos, it just wasn't what I was looking for.  This book is a quick read.  I was able to get through the entire book in about 2 hours (and I am a slow reader).<br /><br />The book is filled with top-notch photos of scene few of us will be lucky enough to see in our lifetime.  If you are looking for pictures of caribou, this is the book for you.  If you are looking for detailed text on the life, habits, and movements of caribou, I would try another book.	2004-11-10

An example of an imponderable is \\"Why don't birds tip over when they sleep on a telephone wire?\\" or the like the title, \\"When do fish sleep?\\"<br /><br />As with any book that covers a myriad of information, there are fascinating parts and there are parts that seem to drag on.  I felt some of the imponderables in the book seemed a little elementary, such as \\"Why is one side of a halibut dark and the other side light?\\" (the dark side is for camouflage and the light side is down so it does not need to be camouflaged), \\"What is the purpose of corn silk?\\" (for pollination), and \\"Why are bowling shoes ugly?\\" (so people don't steal them).  Other questions were fascinating such as \\"Why do roaches always die on their backs?\\" (this is not always true, but it has a lot to do with the shape of the roach) and \\"Why do recipes warn us not to use fresh kiwi or pineapple in gelatin?\\" (the fruits contain an enzyme that break protein down).  The book even has a section of \\"Frustables\\", questions where readers have mailed in theories or questions that do not yet have an answer.  The author even provides a way to contact them to answer frustables or to propose new imponderables.<br /><br />As a geek that likes to learn, even useless information, I enjoyed the book.  However, the book had no format.  I felt the book could have benefited from a table of contents or have the questions divided into related sections instead of aimlessly wander from topic to topic in the book.<br /><br />If you have a friend who sits and reads the cards from a \\"Trivial Pursuit\\" game, this is definitely a book for them.  I'd recommend the book for people whose joy in life is the pursuit of knowledge or a teenager/young adult that is curious about the world around them.  The book is not really a thrilling read, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to a person who is looking for an interesting read.<br /><br />While I think the content of the book was worth a solid 4 stars, I found the lack of structure in the book distracting enough to deduct a star.lly a thrilling read, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to a person who is looking for an interesting read. <br /> <br />While I think the content of the book was worth a solid 4 stars, I found the lack of structure in the book distracting enough to deduct a star.	2004-11-10

The book covers a several topics on improving whitetail habitat on your land.  The book discusses property evaluation, using a chainsaw to improve cover and browse, the importance of access to the property and the food plots, logging, creating food plots, and several other minor topics.  The authors cover each one of the subjects in thorough detail.  For people who cannot afford ATV's and/or tractors to build food plots, the chainsaw chapter is excellent; the chapter discusses how to clear trees to grow deer browse and how to use the \\"waste\\" to funnel deer movements.  The deep plot chapters discuss the best plants to use in the northern United States, and how (including what shape) to construct food plots.  The book is not filled with theory, but rather the real world experience of the authors.  The authors' experience shows as the book is also filled with tips and things to avoid.<br /><br />On the flip side, much of the food plot information is basic.  Having read numerous articles about food plots on the internet prior to purchasing this book, the food plot section was a lot of review.  The book also seems to be an advertisement for BioLogic products (the authors Center is a test area for BioLogic, so I am not sure if they truly think BioLogic is the best or if they just do not have experience with other brands).  I would have liked to see a section on growing food plots with no or with minimal equipment.  While reading the section on food plots, I got the feeling that the authors assume the readers will have access to $5,000 + worth of equipment.<br /><br />This book is filled with information that is useful people who are interested in habitat management for whitetail deer.  While I have not had the chance to practice any of the techniques described, everything in the book seems easy to understand.

The book is a first person account of a outsider observing the Makah Indian hunt for a gray whale off the Olympic peninsula in Northwestern Washington state.<br /><br />The book is the greatest memoir I have ever read.  The book gets a little wordy, but the writing is full of vivid details.  I think the author provides thoughtful insight into the whale hunt through numerous conversations and interactions with local Makah Indians.  I do agree with a previous reviewer that the author's viewpoint did seem slightly biased toward the Makah, but not enough to ruin the book.  Some previous reviewers commented on the accuracy of the book.  To be honest, I do not know enough about the topic to note whether the author's story is inaccurate or not.<br /><br />I purchased the book as I wanted to find out more about the Makah whale hunt, as I did not realize the significance of the hunt to the Northwest Indians at the time it happened.  Judging by the title of the book and the previous reviews, this did not seem like a bad choice.  However, while the book is an excellent memoir, in the end it is a memoir of some journalist I have never heard of.  I admire the author's dedication to the story as he followed it for well over a year while other reporters only seemed to appear when they though something will happen.  In the end, I really did not care if the author slept in a tent or a plywood shack and I really did not find the type of car he rented to be especially relevant.  While I am sure the trip to see the gray whales in the Baja Peninsula in Mexico was a moving experience, I really did not feel it fit into the overall storyline of the book.  Also, I personally found the whole Moby Dick parallel to be incredibly irritating.<br /><br />The book is an excellent read, though it does get wordy at times and some of the subjects do not seem to have much relevance to the storyline.  The author had a lot of interaction with the Makah Indians who were on the whaling crew.  For this reason, I would recommend the book to anyone who is interested in the Makah gray whale hunt.  I would also recommend the book for anyone who is interested in the modern life of Northwest coastal Indians or who are bored and just looking for some decent non-fiction to read.ction with the Makah Indians who were on the whaling crew.

Being a person trained in the physical sciences, I must say I had a difficult time reading this book.  I like equations and concepts that are right or wrong or a question I can calculate an answer that is either correct or incorrect.  This book is a highly academic and philosophic view of violence, forgiveness, repentance, and vengeance.<br /><br />In the authors own words (or at least paraphrased), the book sets out to show that it is possible vindictiveness and vengeance possess some positive value, the relationship between repentance and legitimate forgiveness, explore self-forgiveness, how these issues play out in criminal law and psychotherapy, and the role of Christianity in the previously mentioned topics.<br /><br />Personally, I found parts of the book to drag on (Remember, I studied Engineering.  Philosophy is a new concept to me), but overall I found the book to be unique and intriguing.  The author conveys the point that forgiveness is great, but the victim has every right to be vindictive.  The vindictive side of the victim is just as legitimate as feelings of forgiveness.  I was also very intrigued at the author examination of the topic of Christianity and forgiveness.  In a nutshell, for every story of forgiveness Christianity preaches, there is a story of raw rage and vengeance.<br /><br />The book is a well thought out view of violence, forgiveness, and vengeance.  The author does not pretend to have all the answers, just offer his personal view.  I believe that anyone who is trained in the physical sciences will have a difficult time reading this book (at least I did).  I would recommend this book as an advanced reference on the topic of forgiveness and vengeance.  I would also recommend the book to someone who enjoys reading philosophic views of today's issues in society.	2004-10-07

Also being slightly familiar with the antics of Motley Crue, the story was exactly what I expected it was, the story of four Rock `N Roll degenerates.  However, as I read on, the book became much more than sex, drugs, and rock `n roll.<br /><br />\\"The Dirt\\" is a unique biography on the band Motley Crue.  The book mostly follows a chronological timeline of the history of the band, just like every other biography for the most part.  What makes this book unique is that the story is being told by different people, mainly the band members with some stories from managers and promoters.  I enjoyed this unique aspect as I found it very interesting the way the band members had very different views of the same situation.  It seems that the band could not agree on if the sky was blue.<br /><br />I personally found the beginning of the book repetitive.  Actually, the first half of the book revolves around wild parties, lots of booze, enough drugs to keep South America in business for a year, and countless women performing demeaning sexual acts.  While I initially found the story shocking and intriguing, it was the same thing over and over.  The only thing that changes was the cities.<br /><br />The story picks up again right about the time Vince Neil kills the passenger in this car as the band begins approaching rock bottom.  As the band begins rehab, their life stories really seem to come out.  As the book progresses, the reader can clearly see the members of the band quickly grow from die hard partied young adult to grown men on a mission.  While I thought the stories of the partying and the drugs would be the high point of the book, I felt that the stories of the band members acting like men (such as Nikki and his sister and Tommy taking this son to school) was actually the shocking part of the book.<br /><br />The following is a brief summary of the 4 original members of the band:<br /><br />Nikki Sixx:  While it seemed he would take enough drugs to kill a horse, he was a surprisingly sensitive man.  He blamed much of his problems on abandonment issues that he had with his Dad.<br /><br />Mick Mars:  Mick seemed to be the outsider of the band.  It seemed to Mick that the band was just a job, not something really personal like the other members felt.  Surprisingly, he seemed to be the brains of the band.  I did find his medical problem to be a big surprise.  No matter how big the band got, it always seemed that he was broke.<br /><br />Vince Neil:  I found Vince to be the most intriguing member of the group.  Most any person familiar with Motley Crue knows of Vince's fatal car accident involving Razzle (of Hanoi Rocks I think), for which Vince was sentenced to thirty days in jail.  For an event I thought would be the cornerstone of the guys life, the car accident didn't even cover 10 pages.  However, later in the book, Vince did tell the heartbreaking story of Skylar, this daughter who died at a very young age.  If nothing else, the story of this brave little girl who knew she was never coming home made the whole book worth reading; this is the one part of the book that actually brought me to tears.<br /><br />Tommy Lee:  Throughout most of the book, he seemed like the stereotypical mindless stoner.  However, right around the time his first child was born, Tommy seemed to grow up in a huge hurry.  His last couple chapters of the book I felt were intelligent.  I even though the chapter about taking his son to school was heart-warming, definitely something I would not expect from Motley Crue.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who grew up with music from the \\"hairband era\\".  I would highly encourage any person who was a fan of Motley Crue to definitely read this book.  However, this book is definitely not for young readers or other \\"impressionable\\" people as this book is full of bad things that they could get ideas from.x:  While it seemed he would take enough drugs to kill a horse, he was a surprisingly sensitive man.

Not long ago, I read my first Tom Clancy novel (Without Remorse) and thought it was one of the best things I have ever read.  My wife had gotten me a copy of \\"Op-Center: Games of State\\".  After reading the novel, I really had to wonder if the same author wrote both books.<br /><br />Not to be overly simplistic, but the book can be divided to three sections, the beginning, middle, and ending.  As to try not to ruin the book for anyone who has not read it, I will omit \\"key\\" details.<br /><br />The beginning of the book gives the reader high hopes for what follows.  The book has a heart-pounding beginning in Germany where a Neo-Nazi terrorist organization performed a terrorist raid on an American movie set.  There are people killed and a person kidnapped.  All of a sudden, the book cuts out to the \\"middle\\" (I would estimate the beginning is about 30 pages).<br /><br />The middle of the book, approximately the next 400 pages is dedicated to the pursuit of a leader of a billion dollar a year business in France, who plans on crashing the European economy and encourage civil disorder in America through video games.  Granted the idea is not as foolish as I am making it sound, but it is still a heck of a stretch.  This part of the book revolves around Op-Center finding this person and battling the problem of White Supremacy groups (Op-Center can be thought of as being similar to the CIA or NSA in America).<br /><br />The end of the book begins with a high-speed car chase as an Op-Center agent, who is in a wheel chair, is pursued and fired upon by members of the Neo-Nazi organization after he attempts to crash a Neo-Nazi party.  Narrowly escaping with their life, the agent decides to crash a Neo-Nazi rally.  Along the way, they meet up with a person, who is introduced in the beginning of the book during the terrorist attack, who has no concept of self-preservation.  After a ridiculous statement by the person who the agent met to several hundred armed Neo-Nazis, the wheelchair bound agent and the person (who knows little about combat tactics and easily succumbs to stress) make a run for it.  The ending involves several hundred healthy, armed Neo-Nazis pursuing a person in a wheelchair and their companion.  All I can say without giving too much away is that the ending left me saying \\"alrighty then\\" and shaking my head.  Also in the end, French and Nato commandos take down the video game guy in his factory.<br /><br />This book is a little on the dull side and in parts is highly unrealistic.  I think that 200 pages of \\"fluff\\" could have been easily cut out this book.  Rather than reading like a novel written by a first rate writer, the book read more like a Junior High paper where the student inserts paragraphs of pointless information to make the paper look longer.  The ending (especially with the Op-Center agent in the forest) was ridiculous.<br /><br />I would only recommend this book to people truly interested in the Op-Center series or people who have nothing better to read.  The book is like a marble cake is to someone who only likes chocolate.  Parts of the book are really good and parts are foolish or pointless.ent by the person who the agent met to several hundred armed Neo-Nazis, the wheelchair bound agent and the person (who knows little about combat tactics and easily succumbs to stress) make a run for it.

US	51742815	R35DIFZD3VCLZ6	0312182961	104824053	4,000 Days: My Life and Survival in a Bangkok Prison	Books	3	13	17	N	Y	Would be captivating if better written	This book is, to some extent, a memoir of Warren Fellows' experience with being imprisoned in Thailand for 12 years.  Mr. Fellows, a native of Australia, was sentenced to life in prison for attempting to smuggle heroin out of Thailand to Australia.  During his trail and imprisonment, Mr. Fellows serves time at several different facilities in Thailand.  Finally after 12 years of a life sentence, he is pardoned by the King and deported back to Australia.<br /><br />The prologue of the book begins by describing a scene involving a French prisoner who had a \\"problem\\" with the local insects.  The scene, which is something right out of a horror movie, is described in excellent detail, enough to make my stomach churn.  However, the book went downhill fast from there.  The writing in the book is below average.  I did not feel that the chapters flowed together at all.  While I am sure that prison life is repetitive, Mr. Fellows described how he got into drugs, 12 years in prison, and what it was like to go home in 200 pages.  I expected the book to contain more detail of what a day at a Thai prison was like.  However, the book seemed to concentrate more on several randomly selected stories from those 12 years.<br /><br />Some of the stories in the book were atrocious.  The physical and mental terror that went on in the Thai prison system was astounding.  For example, in retaliation for not ratting out a prisoner, a Thai guard made a group of prisoners who were playing dice stand in a tank of sewage for hours.  There are other graphic stories of mental torture, such as the guards walking circles around a blindfolded prisoner, stopping for a minute, beating the prisoner, and repeating the whole procedure for a hour.<br /><br />There are a couple of scenes in the book that do not seem to add up to me.  First, the author mentions the dirty water in prison and how he thought it came from the river outside.  In top of it, the water intake was supposedly a short ways downstream from the sewage outlet for the prison.  Coming from a first-world country as Australia, which has clean water, then being forced to drink untreated river water contaminated with sewage, I suspect that the water would have made him mighty sick (coming from personal experience).  However, there is no mention of that in the book (granted it could have been left out intentionally).  I found it curious that the author would mention the dirty water in detail, but leave out how sick it made him.<br /><br />Also, the author described a game (though he admits he never witnessed it) where the guards would make a \\"ball\\" out of bamboo, insert a prisoner, lock the \\"ball\\", and use it to try an teach an elephant to play soccer.  Eventually, the elephant would get bored, and crush the ball with the person inside.  I would think it would take a long time to make a \\"ball\\" out of a material such as bamboo (which does not have a consistent thickness, thus increasing the difficulty) that would be able to hold a prisoner securely, and be able to take a few kicks from an elephant before the elephant crushes it (granted the guards could be really bored and have time on their hands).  These two events could very well be possible, but I just found them suspicious.<br /><br />What the author describes of prison life in Thailand is definitely inhumane.  While there was a lot of physical torture, it seemed that the mental torture was what drove prisoners over the edge.  The book kept me reading as I was anticipating a climax to the book that never really came.  By the title of the book alone, any reader knows the ending.  In the end of the book, the author talks about how no one should have to go though this.  While I do have sympathy for the author, if I am scared to go to prison in a certain country, I do not commit a crime in that country, as simple as that.<br /><br />The book is a quick read and I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in foreign prison life.  I felt the book was just average.  If you are bored and need something different to read, by all means pick it up.  If you are looking for a white knuckle, on the edge of your seat experience, I'd recommend something else.he book was just average.

Kelly is an ex-Navy SEAL who is now an underwater demolitionist.  The book takes place in the early 1970's during the fading years of the Vietnam War.  Kelly's wife is killed in an automobile accident.  The book begins by describing his dealing with the loss of his wife.  Kelly then falls in love with Pam, a prostitute, who has escaped from her pimp, who works for an up and coming drug lord.  The pimp/drug lord has a hit done on Kelly and kidnaps Pam.  Though Kelly is left for dead, he is taken to the hospital and recovers.  In the meantime, Pam is brutally tortured and murdered.  As I do not want to give away the rest of the book, all I will say is that the rest of the book deals with vigilante justice.<br /><br />The length of the book is extremely intimidating when you first start reading.  However, the book reads like an excellent movie.  The story is told from three main viewpoints, Kelly's , the police, and the drug ring's.  Clancy does an excellent job of tying the three views of the same story together at the end.  The chapters get a little lengthy at times, thus not leaving a convenient place to stop reading.<br /><br />I would highly recommend anyone who likes reading fiction revolving around the military or vigilante justice.  The book gets a little lengthy, but stick with it.  I though the ending was a little predictable, but it was still a splendid read.  The book had me on the edge of my seat the entire time I read it.	2004-08-28

While I have been successfully in the sense that I usually get a deer even when a majority of the other people in my party goes home empty handed, I have yet to have a big buck mounted on the wall.  While I measure my hunting success based on the wildlife goals of the area, which usually means shooting does of which I am just as proud to get, I wanted to hone my skills to increase my chances to at least see bigger bucks.  While I have bagged deer 12 of 14 hunting seasons, I have only seen 2 trophy class bucks in that time, one of which I was young, got excited and missed, and the other was a poor shot with the weapon I had, so I did not shoot.<br /><br />My first surprise with this book is that the author has the eloquence of a fine poet.  The text in the book flows together flawlessly.  The book takes a no nonsense approach to hunting big bucks.  Virtually every facet of whitetail hunting is covered in this book except review of hunting equipment.  The book consists of 22 well-developed chapters.  Each chapter builds on the previous chapter.  By the time the complete book is read, the author has laid out a detailed outline of how to bag a big whitetail buck.  The author brings up points that I would have never though of before, such as why scents may be bad, what survival equipment is important to carry, and the idea of using a sleeping bag while hunting.  The author has well thought out chapters on various hunting techniques including stand-hunting, still-hunting, deer drives, snow tracking, and stalking.  Each of these chapters discusses the benefits and limitations of each technique.  I felt the best chapters were the chapters on finding whitetails, after the shot, and sportsmanship.  The book ends with a fabulous story about sportsmanship that reminded me that there are still true hunters out there who respect the art of hunting.<br /><br />I feel this book can benefit any whitetail hunter.  The book will help lay out a plan for the inexperienced hunter as well as fine tune the plans of the experienced hunter.  The author has an abundance of hunting knowledge to share with the reader, and is able to do so in a clear manner.  If nothing else, I felt the book built confidence in my hunting abilities.  My words cannot do this book justice; it is really an undiscovered treasure.

The book is an excellent beginners guide to financial planning. The format of the book can either be pleasing and interesting or wordy and rather boring, depending on the background of the reader.<br /><br />  Unlike many financial planning books, this book has a plot. The plot revolves around 3 people, the main character (Dave, a teacher), his self-employed, wealthy sister (Cathy, Landscape Business owner), and their friend (Tom, a plant worker). Dave goes looking for financial advice and after asking his father, he is pointed to Roy, the town barber. The 4 of them have monthly meetings as they get their hair cut, where Roy teaches them a tidbit on financial planning at each meeting. The topics covered include The Ten Percent Solution (fun money for retirement), Wills and Life Insurance, Planning for Retirement, Real Estate Investment, Saving, and Taxes.<br /><br />The book is somewhat like giving an appetizer to a person who has not eaten in a week, it helps, but it is not enough. The book does cover many excellent points, such as compound interest, one of the most important concepts in saving. The idea of a Ten Percent Fund is outstanding and is something I would not have thought of. The book then does an admirable job explaining why a person should have a will. The book begins to trail off with the life insurance section. This is the first point in the book where the reader should be calculating numbers. However, there are no worksheets, poor and insufficient examples, several suggestions, and no equations to make your own calculations; in short, if I was not aware of how to calculate how much life insurance to get, I think I would have still been clueless after this chapter. The planning for retirement section does an admirable job explaining various retirement savings vehicles, but there is little or no mention on figuring out how much a person should save. Once again, there are no worksheets or equations to walk a person though calculating or estimating how much they should be saving for retirement. The chapters on real estate and taxes were informative and were definitely worth reading. The chapter on saving was ho hum; it covered some points, but was mostly common sense.<br /><br />I think the book could have benefited from a chapter dedicated to changing your investment types as the date of a goal approaches, such as retirement. The information on asset allocation is spread throughout the entire book. I also think the book could also greatly benefit from some detailed examples, especially on the life insurance sections and retirement sections.<br /><br />The book starts out making it sound like life could be good if a person could save 10% and invest is wisely. By the end of the book, the ten percent fund is separate from retirement savings and saving for your children's education. Though no numbers are used after introducing the ten percent fund, I estimate a person needs to save and invest 20% of their income to save for play money, retirement, and children's college education. I think most people would have difficulties saving that much.<br /><br />The book is an excellent beginning point in the world of financial planning. I feel the book discusses the items most people would be interested in; however, I think the book could benefit from more detail. The plot makes the reading interesting, but slow and inconvenient to locate information in past chapters. I think the book is definitely worth reading for people who are inexperienced in planning their finances for the future, especially young people just getting out into the world.

This book is unique in that rather than focusing on the entire war, or a specific aspect of the war, this book floods the reader with a myriad of little known facts from numerous facets of the war.<br /><br />The book is divided into 27 chapters.  One of the nice aspects of the book is that each chapter is short enough so that they can be read in 15 minutes or under, thus giving the reader many opportunities to stop reading without stopping in the middle of the story.  The chapters cover a plethora of topics including critters of the Civil War, the role of horses, stories of people before they were famous, the view of both sides regarding the use of Negro soldiers, and an amusing chapter on military officer appraisals.  Some chapters I enjoyed immensely such as the chapters on new and outmoded weapons, how the abolition of slavery was not the North's goal initially, and the chapter on fate/chance.  However, as with any book with this many subjects in it, there are chapters that an individual will not be as interested in.  For this reason, occasionally the book seemed to drag on.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking for non-conventional stories on the Civil War or anyone who is interested in American history in general.  This book would be an excellent academic reference for a paper; however, I would think finding specific information might be difficult without reading the entire book.  The book has a thorough index, but the chapters are organized in such a way that they do not have a specific timeline or geographical location, just information about the general subject described by the chapter's title.	2004-07-30

The book contains a series of short stories and poems, most less than two pages in length.<br /><br />This book is a very unique piece of literature.  It is not a story of the siege, the fighting, and the dodging of snipers bullets the author experienced.  The book does not tell a complete story of the war from beginning to end.  I would equate the book to looking at a photo album and trying to piece together the details of a person?s life from the pictures.<br /><br />The stories seem to be from the perspective of a photographer crossed with a stand-up comedian.  By mentioning a comedian, I am not suggesting that the author tells funny tails of a tragic event, but rather the author seems to have unique observational skills that I have seen in comics.  He is able to capture a moment in time like a photographer and analyze the ?photo? and observe events that most people would not even realized occurred (much like a stand-up comic).  The result is a series of bone-chilling short writings that (to me) showed a side of war that I never thought about.  One story discusses the idea that the enemy may wear the same sweater that you do.  Another story discusses how casual war has become as the author writes about seeing a woman sunbathing, getting up occasionally to launch an artillery shell into the city, then resume sunbathing, just to repeat the process minutes later.  Another, one line poem shows how casual humans take war when a person is called into the house because it is ?grenading outside?.  One of my favorite writings, the author discusses the idea of photographers trading in death to make their livelihood.<br /><br />This book is definitely not for everyone.  If you are looking to research in the war in Sarajevo for an academic project, I would look elsewhere unless you have solid research on the topic completed already.  I think this book can be compared to cognac.  People who can savor its complexity will enjoy this book; to other people, the book will just be brandy.  It is an excellent alternative viewpoint on war in general.  The author does a splendid job bringing rarely addressed perspectives of war to light.leted already.

Looking at the front cover, the basic story of the book is simple to figure out; the book is a memoir that follows Smoke Jumper Murry Taylor though a season of firefighting.  Most of the action takes place in Alaska, but part of the book is spent in the Pacific Northwest as well.<br />The story flows together with the grace and beauty of a world-class composer.  The writing is extraordinarily well articulated and the stories are told in vivid detail.  The author's writing painted remarkable pictures in my mind that rivaled any motion picture I have ever seen.  The author's writing created the same emotions in me that he was feeling at the time.  It really felt as if I was seeing the world through the author's eyes.  I cannot put into words how well this story is told.  I can not give the author enough credit.<br />The book was a roller coaster of emotions; the book made me laugh, it made me cry in parts, and it always had me on the edge of my seat.  This is not a book that covers wilderness firefighting in general.  It is one season, with one particular person who was a Smoke Jumper.  The book contains numerous amusing stories, such as how the author got the name \\"Old Leathersack\\" and the story of the fuel pod dropping out of the plane and re-igniting a fire that was under control.  There were stories of sheer terror such as when the Smoke Jumpers almost got consumed in a fire, and \\"lost\\" several people, not knowing if they were dead or alive and the black bear that invaded the camp (which I thought was funny personally, but I'm sure it was terrifying at the time).  There was also Sally, the love element of the book.  I think Sally helped break up the book, changing the story slightly, while giving an element to the book that everyone can relate to.<br />Some reviewers have said that this book is full of testosterone.  I agree, but this is not a bad thing.  Some \\"literary classics\\" are filled with testosterone and manliness (for example, read Chushingura, written in 1748).<br />I would highly recommend this book for anyone looking for an adventure.  While the topic seems exotic, there are topics in the book that everyone can relate to (anyone who has been in love, felt the isolating loneliness of a long business trip away from loved ones, anyone who feels the need to put their life on the line for reasons others feel are meaningless, or someone who knows the feeling of looking over a gorgeous Alaskan meadow miles from nowhere).  Initially, the length of the book seems intimidating, but it is a fast and enjoyable read.estosterone and manliness (for example, read Chushingura, written in 1748).<br />I would highly recommend this book for anyone looking for an adventure.

I have always had a desire to hunt bear.  I pondered hunting black bear in Northern Wisconsin.  My thought was that it could not be a much harder than hunting whitetails, right?<br />Having never hunted bear, I cannot base my comments on experience, but the information in the book seems to be based on rock solid hunting theories and personal experience of the author.  The book is separated into eight chapters.  The subjects of these chapters include general information on black bears, locating stand/bait sites, stand/bait site preparation, baits and baiting tactics, preparing to hunt, hunting over bait, after the shot, and harvesting the bear.<br />Prior to reading this book, I did not realize the skill and work involved in black bear hunting.  The book points out that bear sign is difficult to spot and offers tips on spotting bear sign.  It also discusses various baits that can be used, depending on local hunting regulations.  For me, the most helpful portion of the book is harvesting a killed bear.  The book points out that bear are difficult to move and will spoil quickly.  It mentions issues that I never would have though of otherwise, such as the fact that bear needed to be cooled within hours and that the hunter should find a butcher who will take a bear \\"after hours\\" as most bear are shot in early evening and the hunter will likely not get the bear out of the woods until after dark.  The book also discusses what can be done to try and keep a bear from spoiling in the event the hunter cannot get it to a refrigerated cooler.<br />I would greatly recommend this book to anyone who is new to black bear hunting.  It really opened my eyes to how much work is involved and the issues that must be addressed after killing a black bear.  I think some of the suggestions in this book would also benefit experienced bear hunters looking to fine tune their hunting techniques.hniques.	2004-07-09

The \\"Kanun\\" dictates revenge in the society.  The \\"Kanun\\" is a seemingly sacred set of rules, laws, and applicable punishments that apply to the values of society and what happens if the values are broken.  However, the rules of the \\"Kanun\\" create a vicious cycle of murder and mayhem in the society it is supposed to be protecting.  If person \\"A\\" kills person \\"B\\", person \\"C\\" (brother of \\"B\\") must kill \\"A\\".  After \\"A\\" is killed, person \\"D\\" (brother of \\"A\\") must kill \\"C\\".  In the meantime, \\"C\\" is in hiding, thus leaving his family to fend for themselves, leaving his fields unattended, etc.<br />The cycle of violence is described from 3 points of view, Gjorg's, Bessian and Diana's, and Mark Ukacierra.  Part of the beauty of this novel is the telling of the tale from three unique and unrelated view points.  Gjorg is a highland Albanian who is caught up in the blood feud and kills a man to avenge his brother.  Bessian and Diana are honeymooners who traveled to the highlands from the city who are foreign to the culture of the highlanders, even though Bessian is knowledgeable of the Kanun and the basics of revenge violence in the highland Albanian society.  Mark Ukacierra is first cousin to the prince, whose job it is to collect death taxes, to collect a tax due to the prince after each killing.  This tax is collected from people like Gjorg.  The author does a remarkable job pulling the three stories together into one.<br /> The only real issue I had with the book was that the chapters seemed long in the middle and there were few natural places to stop reading.  The beginning of the novel was beyond my expectations and the ending was shocking.  However, after the second chapter, the book seemed a little long-winded.  Nonetheless, the story was terrific overall.  This would be a great book to learn about and understand cultures whose existence depended on honor and revenge violence.  This book is not my typical read, but it was still well worth the time.overall.

While Iceland has a system of laws and a judiciary system, there is no law enforement.  This leave Icelandic society to reply on oaths and vigilante justice.<br />The reading is long, and sometimes dull.  The violence scenes are usually short, non-descriptive, and seemingly unrealistic by todays standards.  The tale can be hard to read as characters enter and leave the saga seemingly at random.  However, the saga is well written and suspenseful.  To me, the saga seemed to be comprised or 3 or 4 short stories rather than 1 long story.  Because of this, the ending is kind of anti-climatic.  However, if you are interested in old literature from around the world, this is a book well worth reading.	2003-10-06

There is a story on rabbit hunting on horseback with a stick to riding a bear (inintentionally of course).  Between each story is a humerous &quot;Tall but Short&quot;, a one page tall tale, that reminds me of stories I'd hear from old timers, as we would sit around a campfire in hunting camp.<br />Why is there a &quot;but&quot; in my title?  The only downfall I found with this book is the fact that the stories are taken directly from the magazine for the most part.  If you are a religious reader of &quot;Outdoor Life&quot;, then you have likely seen these stories before.  As only a casual rader of the magazine, I quickly remembered several stories.  Some of the stories were worth a good laugh, most were worth at least a chuckle.  A couple of the stories were worth nothing more than a shake of the head.<br />If you are looking for book of humerous outdoor tales, this is definately a book to get.  I was by no means dissappointed.  However, if you are an avid reader of the magazine, I would spend your money elsewhere.  Enjoy!	2002-11-12

The book does not cover the scandal as much as the people behind the scandal.  The book portrays Ms. Lewinsky as a lost young woman who happened to fall in love with a married man, who happened to be the president.  Ms. Lewinsky portrays President Clinton not as the womanizer Judge Starr and the media portrayed him as, but as a man, who had a poor marriage and was lonely.  Judge Starr was portrayed not as the man looking for truth and justice as I though he was, but as a cold, thoughtless person only looking after his own personal, political agenda.<br />The only downfall to the book is that everyone knows how the story ends.  However, I became so engrossed in the book because it focused on the people of the scandal, not the scandal itself.  It changed how I thought about the major players in the whole affair.<br />While I found the book fascinating, the book is not for everyone.  The story is yesterday's news, and many people would rather the whole thing just went away.  However, if you want to see the scandal from a point of view other than the mass media's, I would highly recommend this book.	2002-02-25
US	51742815	R110W5V1XFH2EX	0553580191	294009896	Seize the Night	Books	3	1	3	N	N	Long &amp; Drawn Out	The book is a memoir type account of the character Christopher Snow.<br />Snow is a young man who suffers from xeroderma pigmentosum (XP).  The bodies of people who suffer from XP are unable to repair the damage done by light, thus their life is restricted to the darkness.  The book revolves around a simple plot with some pretty cool, but commonplace science fiction type twists.  A friend of Christopher's son is kidnapped.  Chris along with a couple friends set out to look for the missing child, several other missing children, and Chris' missing dog.  The town in which they live is the site of a closed military base, in which the children and dog are suspected of being in.  The catch is that the base was the site of many advanced scientific and biological research projects.<br />While the ending of the book was good, most of the time the book was a slow, pointless read.  It takes about the first 350 pages for a kidnapping to take place and 75 pages for a rescue.  The ending kind of left you hanging, similar to a movie trying to leave the possibility of a sequel open.<br />I though the book was just OK.  I cannot say NOT to read the book, but it is not a book that I highly recommend.	2002-02-14

The way the book came together, you can feel emotionally everything Dr. Hargrove goes through.  In the beginning, the diary entries seem slightly upbeat as it seems the ordeal will not last long.  As you read on, boredom and sickness set in.  As the days drag by, there are many highs and moments of hope as well as many lows and letdowns that could crush a person's will to live.  This book has it all!<br />This book gives the reader a sense of what it is like to be kidnapped and held against your will.  As you read, when Dr. Hargrove is happy, the reader is happy.  When Dr. Hargrove is bored, the diary entries are boring and the reader gets kind of bored.  When crushing blows are dealt to Dr. Hargrove, it makes you feel sick inside.<br />The only thing I would have liked to see in the book is a little more detail on the ransom negotiations.  It would have been great to read from the point of his wife and children, what happened during negotiations, how it happened, and what they were feeling.<br />If you want to read about the story of a captive who was held for 300+ days, this is a tremendous book.  However, just as I said before, when days get long in captivity, the diary entries are not that interesting.  Even so, it was well worth reading the book from cover to cover.	2002-01-08

Indianapolis	Books	4	9	9	N	Y	Highly factual yet captures the horror of what happened	The book is simply a detailed story of the sailors aboard the USS Indianapolis.  It would be an excellent reference for someone researching the tragedy of the USS Indianapolis' last voyage, and the book is also great for someone who wants to know what happened.<br />The book is well thought out and very through.  It covers the tragedy from beginning to end.  It talks about the sailing orders, the route on the vessel's last journey, what happened from the US and the Japanese point of view, stories from sailors who survived the attack, the alleged errors made by the Navy, and the trial of Captain McVay.<br />While I perceived the book as highly factual, it was hard not to be saddened by the stories told by the surviving crew.  My heart felt heavy while reading stories of sailors wounded during the initial torpedoing of the ship who never had a chance as the ship sank beneath them, stories of sailors who made it out only to suffer from sun exposure, dehydration, starvation, and photophobia.  The book had stories of men who died heroically trying to save others and men who died as they lost their mental reasoning and tried to swim to far away places.<br />This book is great!  It has the facts behind what happened so you can draw your own conclusions about who was at fault, and it had the testimonies of horror experienced by the people who survived	2002-01-07

The McPhersons do an excellent job of explaining the topics so that even people with no outdoor experience could perform the task almost immediately.  The only exception I found was the chapter on making baskets.  Even though I read the chapter several times, I do not feel I could not weave a basket (in all do fairness, it may be easier when I actually attempt the task).<br />I can not stress enough how easy this book makes a seemingly impossible task for people who lack the basic knowledge of wilderness survival skills.  The McPhersons don't just give you the instructions, they also explain the physics or logic behind what they are writing about.  I recommend this book to anyone who needs/wants a firm foundation in basic survival skills.	2000-12-21

Having lived in Alaska, I enjoyed scenic hiking.  However, it seems that no one knew anything about hiking or bike trails in the area with the exception of a few forest preserves.<br />Mr. Hochgesang's book has a thorough list of places to hike and bike in DuPage county.  Mr. Hochgesang also gives various other pieces of useful information such as maps, parking areas, facilities, what you might see on a particular hike, area history, etc.<br />The book has 23 sections, each describing at least one place and the various trails (some sections describe several if they are close to each other).  The book is slightly outdated, with the information being from around 1994.  Despite this, it is still an excellent book to get acquainted with the various parks, forest preserves, and trailes in DuPage County, Illinois.	2000-12-07

I was quite surprised that the book was a photojournal rather than a hunting  book.<br />However, the book is filled with lots of extraordinary pictures of  whitetails.  The book does contain a lot of information on whitetail deer.  Some of it can be applied to hunting, a lot of it is  &quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;nice to know&quot; type  information.<br />Despite this book not being what I expected, it is still a  very fine book.  I did learn a lot about whitetail deer in this book and  the photography was excellent.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who  enjoys the beauty of a whitetail deer, hunters and non-hunters alike.	2000-08-18

Wanting to  learn more about Quality Deer Management (QDM), I found this  book.<br />Reading this book was the best possible thing I could have done for  myself and the sport of deer hunting.  It teaches you the basics of QDM and  explains why you should do it.  This book addresses old myths like why it  is bad to shoot anterless deer.  It explains that QDM is about deer heard  health, not just antler size.  It expains how to set up a program on your  property, explaining how to do deer density counts, why deer weight is  important to get, how to age a deer, types of food plots, etc..<br />I feel  this is an important book for whitetail hunters to read.  I hunt on public  land, and before reading this book, I would have shot the first buck I saw.  Now, I've learned that where I hunt, it is more important to let the buck  walk on by.	2000-08-16

This book is a charming series of 50 articles written for Reminisce magazine.  These articles each cover a topic  from sometime between the 1930s to the 1960s.  Mr. Strock covers seemingly  every relatable topic from what it was like being a kid during the  depression, what Chirstmas and Halloween was like many years ago, the  difficulty of finding a house after returning from World War II,  etc..<br />Being a younger person (24), I did not think I would enjoy this  book too much; I expected it to be long and boring.  I expected it to be  nothing more than a bunch of stories beginning with &quot;Back when I was a  kid..&quot;  However, each story seems to have its own charm.  Mr. Strock  brought to light was life was like 60 years ago to someone like me who does  not know.  The book is written in such a way that even someone as young as  me can feel and understand the thrills and pains of life many years ago, as  I read each short story.<br />If Amazon.com can not find this book, there is  an address and a number on the inside cover for the publisher: Reminisce  Books P.O.

I found this book to be rather disappointing.  However, in all due fairness, the book is exactly what the author, Sebastian Junger, said it was in the introduction, a  factual book about doomed ships during one of the worst storms of the  century.<br />The book was suspensful, but left me with a &quot;that's  it?&quot; feeling when I finished reading it.  The first 100 pages was the  necessary background of who was who in Gloucester, MA as well as the  prepartations fisherman make before the set sail, what an average day is  like, etc.  The rest of the book consists of various encounters of  people/ships in the storm.  However, Mr. Junger keeps jumping from ship to  ship and I very often kept losing track of who was on what ship and which  ship the Coast Guard was looking for.  The vocabulary could be somewhat  difficult for someone who is not familiar with boating, fishing, or the  ocean.<br />My heart goes out to the families that lost family members in this  storm.  This book does give a reasonable account of what happened in the  storm.  Personally, I feel it would have been a better book if it focused  on one particular ship or write the book from a single person's perspective  rather than keep jumping around as the author did.	2000-07-12
US	51742815	RPNZPHQAIQFZY	0345378482	855829988	The Andromeda Strain	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Way ahead of its time	This is the first Crichton book that I ever read.  The book is a thrilling account of the introduction of a space-borne bacteria into the earths atmosphere.  The bacteria wipes everyone in a small town except a drunk and  a crying baby.  The book is a life-like account of what the scientists  found, how they tried to find what the bacteria is, why these two people  survived, and how do they find a cure.  I felt the fictional technology was  incredible by todays standards, much less in 1969 when this book was  originally copywrited.<br />As an Engineer, I found this book absolutely  awsome.  The way the book was written in general was excellent.  They way  the story was layed out for the reader made it so that I never wanted to  put it down.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes  science/science fiction based work.	2000-07-06

Indeed the book does cover, in pretty good detail, about 5 or 6 cannibal killers.  However, the book also spends  several chapters talking about the psychology behind cannibal and serial  killers.<br />The various stories of the killers were chilling and a must  read.  The psychological portion of the book is a little &quot;dry&quot; to  read, but explains a lot about cannibal and serial killers.	2000-06-23

I'm not one for sappy, emotional, tear jerker books, but this is one of the greatest books that I have read.  I very much disagree with other reviews I have read saying that nothing happens, or Mr. Albom did a poor  job writing the book.<br />I feel Mr. Albom did a terrific job writing a  simple book on a complicated topic.  To me the book is exactly what I  expected it to be.  It was a journal of the last days between not only a  student and a teacher, but two wonderful friends.  However, I felt the book  also did a great job of addressing the bond felt between the two as well as  share some of Morrie's wisdom with the rest of the world.	2000-06-22

The book was pretty good, but it seemed to be long a drawn out on some of the encounteres referenced in this book.  However,  this book did bring to light on how many close calls there really have been  between the US and Russia.  It was kind of shocking to see events and dates  that I remember growing up and did not think twice about at the time appear  in this book as &quot;close calls&quot; between the US and Russia.	2000-06-22

All I can say is what a waste of money.<br />The book did not interest me whatsoever.  I never got past the first couple chapters.  It was written in a format that did  not make sence to me at all.<br />Reading the reviews, if you are a die hard  conspiracy buff, I guess this is the book for you.  If you are looking for  something different to read at night or on the airplane, get something  else.	2000-06-22
