Great photography, lots of good information. It's dreamy, and I know I'll use it a lot as we plan our new home. It cost a little over $20. On the other hand, with that new home in mind I also bought this Pocket Decorator, and I was so disappointed with it. For about the same money, the Pocket Decorator is small and has only a few no-color illustrations of furniture pieces in it. It's a kind of illustrated glossary of  furnishings. How can one publisher afford to give me so much for my money while another one gives me what amounts to a glossary for about the same money? I truly believe I was cheated by the Pocket Decorator, and now I understand why some amazon book buyers are angry about having purchased it.	2004-07-09

A waste of $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$	The rooms in this book are attractive enough but they don't fit the book's title or premise. I feel cheated because I wanted a book that does what it promises by telling me how to create 'luxurious, livable spaces.' I knew I hated the photo on the cover but bought the book anyway, which was my mistake. (A room with one ottoman in it? Is that 'livability?') After I bought the book, I read that the author is a designer who is big in New York.  That explains a lot about the stiffness and unreality of the rooms shown in the book.  Some of those New York designers should get out and see the rest of America some time. This book is not what it is cracked up to be.	2003-10-08

I have bought many decorating books in the last few years, and most of them are a disappointment but this color book is wonderful. I'm getting idea after idea from the book. I really like the setup they used of having questions and then more than one answer or solution. Multiple ideas or solutions helps me work out my own decorating plans. This is a book I keep going back to. It's worth more than www.amazon.com charges for it in my opinion. Uniquely helpful.	2003-05-28

It comes off as trite (no new ideas here) and more than a little tacky and cheap in tone.  And the authors, if one can call them that, come off as snooty and self-satisfied. Sounds like a snooty little book for Yuppies in the 1980s -- definitely  not the right book for TODAY. There are so many great decorating books out there. This is NOT one of them.

I was disappointed in the book, however. It's a nice collection of pretty pictures, but that's about it.  I expect more than that from a book.

Maybe it's the old southern thing, but the book has a dated, fussy feeling about it. It's overwhelmingly traditional and lacking the kind of spark that homes in other parts of the country have. Good idea but not inspiring (unless you live in the south, I suppose). Over-done rooms just don't feel right for most of us today.	2003-05-13

I just bought it, but I have to say that the cover looks different than the one amazon is showing. Better. This is a great book for anyone who loves to decorate with collections. The book shows great houses of REAL people who obviously are into their \\"stuff\\" and know how to decorate with it. It's really great that the book shows lots of different decorating styles and different collectibles. Everything from fine antiques to Deco, Mid-Century, Fifties Funk. It's fun to look at, fun to read, has tips on specific collectibles, and LOTS of information on decorating with all that stuff you can't help but buy. The homes are realistic but unusual, so the book shows some surprises as you flip through it. If you love flea markets and garage sales and antique stores and ebay  (et cetera, et cetera) chances are you will love this book. I find it inspiring and refreshing because it also gets away from the predictable, picture-perfect kinds of homes that are so been-there-done-that.

It's empowering me to make my home &quot;happy&quot; and a lot more fun. I saw the author on a Christopher Lowell rerun and jotted down the book's name, which I promptly forgot. But then I walked into the bookstore and came face to face with the same book on a display, so I knew I had to buy it. It's my decorating fate! This book defines various cottage looks, all the while talking about how to use those colors, furnishings, fabrics, and so on to turn your home into a cottage getaway. An interesting approach. I want to escape when I go home, so I am using this book as one of my guides in creating that &quot;great escape&quot; look in the suburbs. What I love is that my husband is getting into it, too. He talks about going away to his &quot;cottage&quot; on the weekends. This book doesn't focus on kitsch or clutter (but it did help me organize the teapots I collect) but on creating a look that can make a home seem like a farmhouse or a log house or a nautical seashore cottage in simple, tasteful ways.	2002-02-18

Great for thumbing through on a weekend afternoon. The author has tapped into my psyche by fueling my dream of having a getaway cottage. We want a dreamy place not in Europe but close enough to home so that we can escape every weekend if we want to. Fortunately, that is possible in our part of the country where vacation homes are common. I've searched for vacation homes and cottage books, and the best are:<BR> SECOND HOME. Rating: 10. This gorgeous coffee table book is also practical. Great houses, dreamy photos of locations, but the homes, which are in all styles from cabins in the woods to big family homes on the Atlantic, aren't out of reach. The book has tips on finding a location and that sort of thing as well as decorating. Nice resource list with internet sites for more information. Blends dreamy beauty with information.<BR> THE CABIN. Rating: 6. Another pretty coffee table book. Not practical in any way but nice to look at. More of an architecture book than anything else.<BR> COTTAGE STYLE. Rating: 8. All about decorating any home so it looks like a weekend cottkage. My decorating &quot;bible.&quot;<BR> ADIRONDACK STYLE. Rating: 5. Good pictures of homes and interiors. But it's limited to one rustic style, of course.	2002-01-10

What I like about this book is that it blends the practical and pragmatic with the dreamy and romantic. It's a book I keep going back to, either simply to look at and dream with or to get specific tips from. Although the book doesn't go into great detail on any one topic, it covers all the bases about deciding on a cottage/vacation home location and style, gives tips on how to shop around, touches on fianances and taxes, and then shows one glorious yet somehow believable vacation home after another. This is a gorgeous book, but it's more than a dream book. It seems to be written for real people (not the rich and famous!) who are sincerely interested in finding, decorating, even building or remodeling a great getaway home. I &quot;gifted&quot; myself with this, but I now find I'm buying copies as gifts for friends who, like me, long to have a retreat.	2001-11-30

Wrong. The book doesn't deliver what it promises. Common stains are not always included.

Certainly I found the photos lovely, but somehow the overall package does not convey the excitement, spirituality, and drama of the region. In other words, the book is a little flat.

The book comes off as a cold report on what is in fact a fabulously exciting and inspiring region.	2001-11-12

This book simply shows one junked-up place after another, missing the point that finding cool castoffs and so-called junk from the curb or flea market can produce really personal, really interesting living spaces. The places in this book disappoint because what are touted as real places to live come off as unedited junkyards, not to mention unlivable so-called &quot;homes&quot; created simply for effect and not for life. A stupid book on which I wasted my money. I'd give this a minus 2 if I could.	2001-11-12

Not worth 5 cents	I am so sorry to see that Jan Karon, a writer who started out with a lovely vision for her Mitford books, has reached the point of simply cashing in on her success by publishing absolute utter junk. I have enjoyed the Mitford books, even though I know they are schmaltzy and predictable. I immerse myself in the charm of the settings and just follow the stories along, learning something about faith along the way. This Snowmen book is NOT worthy of Ms. Karon, of the Mitford series, or of Ms. Karon's devoted fans. In fact, it is an INSULT. It has nothing to say, it isn't even a short story (much less a book), and you can whip through it about as quickly as reading a story aloud to a toddler. I advise the author to wait until she has a real plot in mind before coming out with a new book, and then she should make it a book that an adult can spend at least several evenings reading. In the meantime, if Ms. Karon needs money this badly, perhaps she should get a job like the rest of us.	2001-11-05

We love the houses and all the different locations, we're getting lots of ideas for what to look for in a location, and the book is a pleasure to look at. A wonderful package. I may even get an extra copy as a Christmas gift for friends who have talked about wanting to find a second home too.	2001-11-05
