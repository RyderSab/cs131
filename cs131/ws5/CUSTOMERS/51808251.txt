This was really interesting.  This is the first-hand account of a lower level professional at Enron who worked there for about 8 months before the bankruptcy and scandal erupted.  This was not a real &quot;insider&quot; as far as the people he dealt with and what he did there.  It's still interesting as far as learning how the day-to-day worked at Enron for the &quot;normal&quot; employee.  You get peeks into the hiring process, training, how quarterly evaluations were handled, basically a bird's eye view of the typical joe at Enron.  The rest is his recount of basically what's in public records, appeared in newstories, and a few things about what higher-up revealed to him about Enron.  I really knew little about Enron before reading this, so I didn't mind that probably 60-70% of this was recanting media stories.  For someone with good knowledge of the key players and issues, this probably will not hold your interest.  If you want to know what the average guy at Enron observed and how Enron operated from his view, this is very good and funny.<br />The title is a real misnomer.  The author witnessed no greed first-hand at Enron, but pontificates on greed based on the news stories, etc., that any of us could in any event.  Coming from someone who while not appearing greedy, but pretty close, selling Enron items on E-Bay that he took with him, he wasn't necessarily the best person to discuss greed.  Rationalizing that Enron owed him falls a little short.<br />A good insider's view from the ranks.	2004-07-02
US	51808251	R3G73C0FD2EEOK	0739313118	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	3	25	35	N	N	Nancy Drew goes to the Louvre	This novel read like a bad Nancy Drew.  It is full of cliches and melodrama that aren't really necessary.  It is also impossible for any lay-person to participate in solving the mystery.  Finally, the characters are terrible.  There is almost no character development, every character is a total stereotype cardboard cut-out.  Eventually, some of them really grate on your nerves.  I found the protagonist Robert Langdon as barely tolerable almost from the beginning.  I despised Sofia Neveau equally, though she grew on me a little at the end.  And these were the central characters.  It is possible I just didn't like the reader's voice or something, but you really have no empathy with any of the characters.  You don't believe they are real for a moment.<br />Despite all this, it is a good mystery that is very fast paced.  The last 1/4 of the book or so are particularly good, fast, and tight.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I really was sort of sad when it ended, the plot and mystery were that good.  This is despite hokey dialogue, terrible characters, silly get-aways, and the overly melodramatic elements.<br />This novel is not for the easily offended.  It passes off a lot of alternative theories and thoughts on the life of Christ, and the early Church in particular, as fact. If you take it as fiction or something interesting, it is fine and actually pretty good.  If you are easily offended about alternative theories on your faith, this book is not for you.  The author also tends to have some sort of obsession with male nudity.  How many times was Silas partially nude or nude when there was nothing about the plot that necessitated such nudity?  I mean, the author goes out of his way numerous times to describe Silas' nudity all the time in scenes.  Huh?  Why?  With all this talk of nudity, I was hoping Langdon and Neveau would do their own Proiry of Scion worship routine at the end and we might be treated to some hot action.  No such luck, at least within the book's pages.<br />Do I recommend this book?  Yes, but don't expect it to be as amazing as it has been hyped.  It's a good basic plot and mystery, but certain elements will make you laugh out loud at the hokiness.  You might want to borrow it from someone, or check it out from the library instead of buying it.  It did keep my full attention for the whole 11 tapes of the unabridged version, so that is quite a feat.  But it has many, many flaws as well.ook's pages.<br />Do I recommend this book?

It is very educational, but done in such a way that it seems as if you're listening to a novel, and not historical biographies.  It also covers a lot more than the wives themselves, the author gives historical backdrops to the time of each, what was going on and the like.  Some have criticized it as not being as scholarly as previous works on these women.  That may be true, but those aren't on an audio cd, which is what I wanted.  I don't necessarily have the time to read, so sometimes I have to cover my interests with an audio cd.  This fit the bill.  I learned a lot about this time and it was an entertaining and informing disc.   If you are looking for something more strictly scholarly, then you probably are better off with the books by others that are recommended here.  There are times when the author imparts motives and beliefs on people, with a disclaimer, but I'm not sure there's much proof or evidence in this regard.  But it makes it read like a novel a lot better, or a story really, and does make it more interesting.<br />It is 6 discs, each runs an hour or so.  The first 3-4 discs are all Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn.  There is more known about them, I guess, and on a historical scale, they are the more important wives.  There's not much on Jane Seymour and Catherine Howard.  Anne of Cleves is covered a bit better.  The Katherine Parr section was fine and actually pretty thorough as well, almost one disc to herself.  It takes some getting used to listening to the woman who reads, but I grew to like her.  It is a little funny to hear her lower her voice when trying imitate Henry VIII when reading a line of his, or lighten and soften her voice when doing the same for one of the women.  She did a really nice job mimicing the long speach apparently given by Howard at the block, I really felt like I was listening to the doomed woman herself.<br />If you need a six hour entertaining and interesting history lesson on Henry VIII's six wives, this is it and fits the bill perfectly.	2004-03-31
US	51808251	R1KZ6TOX26ILW6	0967282233	886940629	Split Image: The Life of Anthony Perkins	Books	2	11	13	N	N	Grim portrait, perhaps not entirely accurate	This book makes Anthony Perkins appear as a self-centered, mean, drug addict who had little good in him at all.  The book goes into paintstaking detail about a lot of really ugly aspects of this man's life.  The author appears to have gone out of his way to make Perkins look like an absolute idiot in every way possible.  He succeeds.  The man is completely unlikable if this book is the only thing you read.  The book is written in a very gossipy fashion, which might turn some people off, content aside.<br />While I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the book, it seems extremely one-sided.  I cannot imagine Perkins could have been this bad.  I cannot figure out whether the author had a vendetta against Perkins, or no good stories were told because those closest to Perkins who knew those good facts declined to participate in the book.  There is ample evidence for either proposition.  Though he denies this, the author really appears to dislike Perkins and enjoys ridiculing him.  The author even has a hard time admitted that Perkins was, in fact, a great actor.  It's like the author feels forced to mention after smearing him about some off-stage antic, that Perkins actually was good in a production.  Regardless of his personal life, it cannot really be disputed that Perkins was a top actor, not even for a second.  But why would one write a biography of someone you don't like?  <br />None of Perkins' family or friends participated in this book.  Whether this made the author angry and he turned it into a hatchet job (it is a hatchet job) for revenge, or whether Perkins really was this horrible, we will never know.  The alternative is, his family could have made it a more balanced book as they may have known an entirely different man, and their non-involvement in this book left it lop-sided.  Those who liked Perkins or were friendly with him did not contribute to this book.  It shows.<br />Whatever was going on, this is a must-read for any fan.  Be warned, however, itis a very negative portrait that I do not think is entirely accurate.  What is in the book I do believe to be true, but it is not balanced with anything.  Was there anything to balance these recounts?  We will never know.	2004-03-19
US	51808251	R3IGNFHF4NU9TZ	0316724459	718240166	Celebrity	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Beautiful, interesting, really great	This is a book of beautiful photography featuring a wide range of really great celebrities.  The photographs run from Queen Elizabeth II to Joan Rivers.  You have the Beatles, Rod Stewart, Peter Sellers, supermodels of yesterday and today, Woody and Mia, Dame Edna, and even the great Diva herself, Miss Faye Dunaway.  Terry O'Neill has photographed all the greats of the second half of the 20th century, and we find them here.  Terry O'Neill tells a brief history behind some of the select photographs.  Those are really interesting.  Gill does the introduction.  This is a beautiful book if you are interested in celebrity photography.<br />The Gill introduction is too long and too overdone.  It also has some pretty glaring mistakes.  William Holden was floating in the pool at the beginning of Sunset Boulevard, not Joseph Cotten.  When Gill is waxing on about what is means to be a celebrity for pages and pages, this is a really bad mistake.  O'Neill messes up a few dates.  The famous photograph of Faye Dunaway was Spring of 1977, not 1976.  It was the night after her Oscar win, and O'Neill was married to her for several years after that, you'd think that would be an easy date to remember.  It is one of his most famous photographs.  <br />But this book is not about the introduction or exact dates, it is about the photographs.  Each one is truly a pleasure to look at and study.  The only &quot;complaint&quot; I have about this fabulous book is that it could have been physically larger.  Some of the photographs spill across the spine because they are too large for one page.  It's minor, but it made a few of the photographs slightly less enjoyable to look at.  All in all, this is an A+ book and for a book of this nature, it is extremely low priced.  Buy at once!	2004-02-09

Being a long-time fan of Miss Dunaway, I bought this the day it was released and read it straight through when I got home.  Frankly, I wasn't expecting much.  I always got the impression she has no sense of humor, particularly about herself.  I also figured she was writing this for the money, and it would be a typical take-the-money-and-run, say-nothing bland autobiography like most of the other celebrity junk that's out there.  Boy was I wrong!  While Miss Dunaway is certainly a very serious person, the book was pretty candid, the good and the bad, covering topics I didn't think she'd cover much like Mommie Dearest, Marcello Mastriani, her two marriages, etc.  She covers it all pretty thoroughly and candidly.  While this book is certainly not a &quot;tell-all&quot; or at the Shelley Winters level (thank goodness), it's pretty thorough.  She also covers a lot of her early career, college, and her growing up in rural Florida, a lot of information you can't get from magazine articles or prior media materials about her.  It was very, very well done, well written, and is obviously must-read material for any fan or someone interested in the premier actresses of her generation.  You won't be disappointed.  It also has some great photographs in the center section, and Terry O'Neill did the cover.  Great stuff!	2004-01-30

I know virtually nothing about Andy Warhol and the Factory, except for what I got in art history classes, which was pretty bland.  I *think* I got a lot of this book, but who knows.  It was tremendously interesting, and some parts are really, really funny.  Others are really, really scary.  For anyone interested in Andy Warhol and the people who made up the Factory, this book is for you.  Mary Woronov was there and there is a chapter about many of the main people.  It didn't mean much to me apart from entertainment because I had/have no idea who these people were/are, but for someone more serious about these people, this would be a must-read book.  For the casual fan of Mary Woronov, you get a sense of her funny personality and stuff, her youth and college are covered, but there's nothing after the Factory.  Whatever your interests, the book keeps your attention and is a great read.	2004-01-30

There's not much about this in there at all, and he hardly talks about his film career.  It is introspective and interesting, but he doesn't really discuss his career much at all.

This is a nice white-wash book that is trying to soften her up to run in 2008 and to cash in on a lucritive book deal.  It is well done, but there's nothing really here.  I doubt she wrote it, it is an attempt to make her look saint-like.  Like most books of this ilk, if you like her, you'll like the book.  If you don't like her, you'll hate the book.  Very little substance here, but for her fans, a must-read.	2004-01-15

Everyone knows the story: wealthy alcoholic crazed movie star adopts orphan girl and abuses her for a lifetime.  And abuse her she does, if the book is accurate.  There are some savage beating, some very cruel mental games, and some totally irrational behavior.  But a lot of it was just JC's strange adherence to formality, manners, and the like.  Everyone has some strange quirks, and BOY OH BOY did JC have them.  Much of it fell far short of abuse.  I don't think Christina meant to convey this, but she taunted her mother, A LOT.  If your mother is manic about Christmas card lists, THEN DO THEM ON TIME!  It doesn't take a genius.  If your mother is drunk and trying to pick a fight, lay low and act nice, don't stand up for yourself and try to make a point!  And Christina talks about money and her entitlement to it from her mother, A LOT.  She complains about being impoverished after she dropped out of college and JC stopped supporting her.  Well, she was an adult, and she did drop out of college.  JC did tell her if she dropped out of college, she was on her own financially.  You can't blame a woman for keeping her word.  And then Christina whines that JC harldy ever gave her any cash while she was in college, even though JC was paying for evertything and poor Christina had to, to, to, TYPE TERM PAPERS to make a few extra bucks!  Again, not exactly abuse material.  The best one was when JC gave Christina Al Steele's 1955 Thunderbird.  All Christina complains about is how expensive it was to park and fill with gas, like JC was supposed to pay for that, too.  You get the impression that Christina was very, very greedy and wanted very much to be a movie star like her mother and to live the rich life like her mother.  She clearly missed the obscene birthday parties, the limelight, and being publicly associated with her mother, all of which diminished when she got older.  Well, this bookput her right back next to her mother.  JC was phyically abusive and sick in many ways, but I don't see JC as the total villain here either.  Christina had a lot of annoying personality traits that would have led many to disinherit her and shun her as an adult also.  It was a battle of the wills between them.  Christina gets the last word.  I think it's probably true, but I also get the impression that had JC had a lot of money when she died (she actually didn't have much) and had left a lot of it to Christina, this book would never had hit the shelves.<br />BTW, it made for a great movie.	2003-10-26

And, yes, I sent her a couple of bucks when she needed it, because the site was hilarious, so she earned it and then some.  The book gives some background on some specifics of her &quot;glory days&quot; of insane shopping and spending and some of her rises and falls with her jobs.  It was never clear to me from the webpage where she had worked, what she did, and the like.  Some gaps on the webpage are answered in the book.  The book is not War and Peace and it isn't life changing, but it's a book you will highly enjoy if you like(d) her website.  If you think Karyn is irritating or think she's a rip-off artist, then don't read the book.  This isn't a book that will make Karyn-haters like her, it is just like her webpage.  <br />If you have never seen her webpage, this is the true story of an upper middle class girl from Chicago who moved to NYC in her late 20's to sort of find herself and start a new life.  New to Manhattan, she got totally carried away with crazy spending on clothes and lifestyle spending and ended up about $25K in the hole on credit cards.  She details several purchases, a lot of the crazy stuff she blew dough on, and does it in a very funny way.  Some of the rationalizations she used on herself to justify things like $300 sunglasses are pretty funny.  There's nothing wrong with purchasing $300 sunglasses if you can afford them, but it's items like these.  Anyway, at the height of her insane spending, she lost her job.  So, broke Karyn puts up a webpage sort of as a joke, explaining her plight and asking people to send her money if they want to, being totally honest about what it is for.  She does &quot;Daily Buck&quot; stuff where she tells a story of each day about how she saved money that day, and insights as to why cheaper shampoo, etc., works just as well as the expensive stuff.  And you know what, folks, Karyn is right.  You also get to know some of her friends, neighbors, her roommate, and her cat and dog.  The webpage ends up being a real hit, Karyn becomes somewhat of a celebrity, and then eventually gets enough money from the webpage and selling her crazy items on e-bay and is now debt-free.  It's a fun and interesting book if you're into this kind of story-line.  I found it very, very funny.  If this sounds dumb to you, you probably won't like the book.	2003-09-17

But, wow, what a couple of dingbats.  They put a lot of people's lives at risk, though, so I would like to say they are harmless, but they are not really harmless.  You can tell by looking at their pictures on the cover that nothing will stop their missionary works and they totally don't care about the lives of the people they endangered.  I honestly don't think they are bright enough to realize that their actions actually endanger a lot of people and their actions may be doing more harm than good on a global level.  Nothing will stop these girls, that much is clear.  They say at the end that they are planning a missionary trip to the Sudan by way of Lybia.  Good grief!!  The book is not well written, a little rambly at times.  These girls, I don't know, something is missing upstairs if you catch my drift.  Also, I was sorely disappointed.

She befriends an underaged pregnant woman, finds out the real deal, and helps her.  It was life-changing.  She cannot get over her mother's death.  That's about it.  There is nothing else here.  She seems scarily odd, also, almost insane.  If you love Rosie and want to learn about her, go for it.  For the casual fan on down, it is a complete waste of time and money.  I have read pamplets at the doctor's office that have more substance.	2003-01-02

I was really excited about reading about Cher's sexcapades over the years, all the men, all the wild times, to get to know the real woman who is the diva we all know as Cher.  Who better to tell it than her daughter?  All the reviews here talked about Chastity's \\"honesty.\\"  What a bust!  Chastity was honest all right, honest about her own boring life.  Who cares!  There was hardly any content on Cher at all.  At least she could have tossed in some Greg Allman stuff, or a few tid-bits on Rob Camiletti a/k/a the Bagel Boy.  No!  Not a word!  All it was was some boring tale about Chastity's life as a lesbian.  Sorry, that holds no interest for me.  If you don't have any interest in Cher, this book is for you.  Otherwise, stay away!	2003-01-02

The heroism and courage of the passengers and crew go without saying.  The story was inspiring and reflects the true depth of character of those aboard and their final sacrifice.  That said, I could not help to feel in much of the book that I was invading the privacy of these courageous individuals and the manner in which some of the book is handled perhaps could have been handled differently.  There were many, many details about the victims' lives, both years before September 11, the days leading up to it, and the day itself.  At times I felt like there was almost too much detail that was really not necessary.  I am not certain the details of some of them the day before and getting to the airport that day really have much relevance to the actual events aboard or the people they were.  Is it really important to know who almost missed the flight but did not, who ended up getting on the flight by standby, or who had missed another missed flight only to end up on this one, and who had booked it for months?  It almost plays to morbid curiosity that perhaps has little to no relevance about the actions on board.  In a way, it became well, voyeuristic, in this regard.  It made the theme almost too sensational or almost too commercialized.  The various portions of the premonitions of some of the passengers and families I feel were handled poorly as well.  As someone who is scared to fly, I have &quot;premonitions&quot; that my planes will crash almost every time before I get on one.  I do not believe this is uncommon.  Again, it bordered on the almost too sensational, the too voyeuristic.  One passenger had such a premonition the night before but did not change the flight.  Is it really pertinent to the actions taken on board and the sacrifice taken?  <br />This is the definitive book on Flight 93 for those interested and the theme of the book and what it reflects are extremely powerful and well done.  Just be aware that the book contains a lot more information than you might really want to know or are comforable with knowing.	2002-09-23

This book has everything for the Rafter fan, match results, insights, quotes from fellow players, and even a revealing centerfold that will leave any woman satisfied.<br />I highly recommend this book!	2001-12-27

This is a great story of the goddesses of Ancient Greece, all of whom want to be the Goddess of Love, Venus.  Hence the title.  First there's Hera, the Queen of the Goddesses.  Even though she's the Queen of the Goddesses, she's jealous because she hasn't done anything significant in almost 3 years.  Then there's Diana the Goddess of the Dumptrucks who's tough but gets injured a lot so she's jealous of Venus.  Venus' sister Isis only comes out of Hades a few months of the year, so she's not really a top contender among the Goddesses.  Artemitis spent years hanging out with Bacchus, but has now cleaned up her act and is in contention for Top Goddess.  However, she loses her nerve in the presence of the almighty Venus, though she has Hera's and Isis' numbers.  Finally, there's Andromeda, who was attacked by the Cracken years ago, and can't quite get her powers back.  If you like mythology, this book is for you.	2001-11-29

I loved the first two (Rita Will, Sudden Death).  The premise in this novel is hilarious, and about the first third of the book does not disappoint.  I'll admit, I could not put it down, but after the first third, it seemed to lose some steam.  In other words, the great premise doesn't carry the whole novel.  It may have been better as a short story.  Anyway, all we're left with when the premise poops out are very one-dimensional characters who are either lovable 100% tolerant saints, or 100% prejudiced, narrow-minded bigots whom you can't choose but to hate.  No character falls in between.  A few of the plot lines ended up very unrealistic, at least to me.  Unlike some of these other reviews, I absolutely loved the sequence in the painting, but I wouldn't have ended the book with it either.  The problem is, by the time you get to the painting sequence, the plot has pretty much fallen apart anyway into either the mundane or the wholly unreal.  Don't get me wrong, it is an interesting read and the author's humor stays with you throughout, but once the premise wears off, the novel falls apart a little.	2001-10-24

It's just I've seen the same scenario in so many other books and Lifetime TV movies.  While her tale is terrible, it doesn't make for particuilarly interesting reading, at least for me.  Her father sexually molested her for years, her mother didn't care, she grew up poor and unloved, she never felt love from her parents, and it made her nuts as an adult.  *YAWN*  As for the &quot;amusing&quot; sections of her thinking she's the Second Coming, her hearing God, being Celestia, and tracking down that spaceship in the desert, that was probably less than 5% of the book!  We're talking 15-20 pages, tops.  I was eagerly awaiting those &quot;entertaining&quot; parts.  Trust me, the &quot;good&quot; passages are the ones that have already been reprinted in articles.  You're to page 187 or so of a 245 page book before you even read the word &quot;Celestia.&quot;  Up to then, it's details about her dysfunctional childhood, her early career and inability to enter into healthy adult relationships, which hardly makes her unique.  Also, I wanted good dish on her relationships with Ellen and Steve Martin.  Once again, there was VERY little of that.  She covers Steve Martin in about 2 pages.  She gives Ellen about 10, but it's equally vapid.  If you're a die-hard fan of Heche, go for it.  If you want to read her whacky Celestia stories and have a laugh, save your money, they are few and far between.	2001-09-28

What I ended up with was a tremendously interesting and engaging book.  Rita Mae Brown has perspectives and experiences unlike my own and I could not put the book down.  I liked the parts about her family also.  Certainly there are political messages here, but they are based on her own experiences and are not \\"preachy\\" or coming from someone who lives in theories only.  If you are a fan of her books, this will be a big treat for you.  If you don't know her, read this book for a different life perspective, particuarly about women's issues, including lesbian issues.  If these issues offend you, or you don't like reading about them, then this book is probably not for you.  It's not an integral part of the book, but it is there.  The book is about a person.  The book reads like you are talking to her, and she is very interesting.  Also, I always suspected Billie Jean King was wretched personally, so I really liked the parts where my opinion is all but supported by someone in the know!<BR>This is an autobiography.  Of course the book is about her.  Dah!  There are a few instances where she comes off a little haughty in my opinion, but I haven't published books or earned the money to have a farm in Virginia, and I didn't struggle through poverty for years to get there either, so I think she's entitled to a little license, folks.  The only part I didn't like was when she discussed Fannie Flagg's former lover and only gave her a pseudonym with a vague but \\"see if you can guess\\" description.  I'm a born gossip and love stuff like that!  I think I figured out her hints, but I hate having to do that.  It's such a silly exercise.  Maybe that was the point in doing that, who knows.  Anyone in the closet ought to read this regarding her depiction of Jerry Pfeiffer.  I think the silliness of that lifestyle is well exposed simply by recounting the facts.  Anyway, very good read!	2001-09-25

I have read a great deal of Bette Davis-related books over the years, and this book contain about 80% fresh materials, which is nothing short of a miracle more than 10 years after her death.  The style  of the book is simply the text of several extended interviews the author  had with Miss Davis, as well as with others who had worked with her.  The  questions are interesting (as are the answers), and the style makes the  information seem much more interesting and believable.  A must for any fan,  and, once again, I was particularly impressed with many fresh topics.   Excellent!	2000-04-27
