I bought this book in my latter years as general manager of engineering & production operations. I consider it as a handy companion to 'Managerial Problem Solving' by Charles Margerison, which I have reviewed earlier.<br /><br />Essentially, this book is quite stimulating to read as it is packed with 60 proven strategies to facilitate group meetings. The authors walk the reader through the entire problem solving process, although I must add that the breadth & depth of which is not as comprehensive as 'Managerial Problem Solving'.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the 60 tools are simple. They have been quite well-designed to deal with many basic group meeting obstacles: personality clashes, time-watsers & procedural wrangling. In my work, I have found many of them to be quite practical & effective.	2005-09-20

When I first embarked in the late 80's on a quest to start my own small strategy consulting business, after spending twenty-four years in the corporate world, I actually acquired this wonderful book, after a deliberate search, to help me to think through all the potential problems & opportunities.<br /><br />What attacted me to this book was the anatomy of asking questions in the prologue of the book. According to the two authors, both business consultants, every successful ideas passes through three phases. Each phase involves a different perspective. To implement an idea, all three need to be integrated. They label them as follows:<br /><br />- Visualising What to Do: Seeing & painting a clear picture of my company: identity, resources;<br />- Charting the Position: Aiming & drawing up a blueprint for action: strategic objectives, trends;<br />- Activating the Plan: Doing & implementing my objectives: tactics, role expectations;<br /><br />As you can see from the above, the first one refers to the process of conceptualisation. The second one refers to the process of strategising i.e. formulating the strategic blueprint. The final one refers to operationalising i.e. putting the strategic blueprint to work.<br /><br />The full value of seeing, aiming, & doing comes when they are integrated. Questions like (adapted for my own personal application):<br /><br />- what business am I really in?<br />- what are my strategic objectives?<br />- what are my tactics?<br /><br />are part of a larger mosaic. The answer to any question affects the others.<br /><br />The next part of the book comprises the integration model. It starts off with the development of a Questioning Mindset. The authors emphasise that the same question can be asked in many different ways, depending on the intended results. Answers alone may not be the only objective. Just right questions can affect attitudes & perceptions. They can be asked to get the process started. Here the authors outlined the three basic question-asking techniques:<br /><br />1. Startling: The Surprise Question:<br /><br />The intent is to be creatively upsetting. The authors illustrate with a classic business question: What business am I in? To make it startling or confrontational, the question could be re-stated: What makes me think I am still in the business I say I am?<br /><br />Questions asked this way are confrontational. The intent is to open my eyes & undermine outdated assumptions.<br /><br />2. Supporting: The Helping Question:<br /><br />I call this the Discovery Question. The authors draw an analogy of a trial lawyer. An experienced trial lawyer avoids asking questions whose answers he/she is not certain of. In a trial, lawyers use questions to promote their own understanding of the case to the judge & jury. Any discovery of information should happen before the trial starts. In my case, the purpose of such questions e.g. 'what business am I in?' is to discover what I already know.<br /><br />3. Searching The Inquisitive Question:<br /><br />Example: what business am I really in? The purpose is to find out what I don't know but need to know. The emphasis is the spirit of inquiry.<br /><br />The authors stress that the best answers are open-ended, thereby resulting in useful answers that keep evolving.<br /><br />The rest of the book comprises a series of well-thought question units covering every aspect of business management. , There are a total of forty four units, & each is supported by a brief rationale. They are logically allocated to the three foregoing distinct phases. Each unit is designed to develop a broad \\"just right question\\" such as:<br /><br />- what business am I really in?<br /><br />& expands its implications through a series of \\"follow-up questions\\" such as:<br /><br />- what business will I be in a few years from now?<br />- what business could I be in?<br /><br />As you can see from the foregoing examples, the whole exercise of the questioning processes is intended to facilitate understanding of the implications of the question & pondering of the answers. In other words, to facilitate a question-asking approach for an answer-producing payoff.<br /><br />By the time I have gone through all the question units under each distinct phase, I have finally painted a constructive & enlightening picture of my dreams-come-true.<br /><br />This book really stands up to its title, A Question of Business: Questions for Managers Looking for Answers. Until today, I have yet to come across another business book under this particular genre.<br /><br />Even today, despite the torn yellowing pages & stained dog-ears, I still dip into the question list of the book to refresh my strategic thinking on emerging issues.<br /><br />To sum up my review, I am proud to say that I am still running my own small strategy consulting business today. Today is my 15th year in business.<br /><br />I am very happy to share this wonderful gem with readers. This book will definitely help you to develop useful answers by learning to ask incisive questions.<br /><br />[READERS!

(*responsible, respectful, and resourceful)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	I highly recommend this book to all parents & teachers! Packed with real-world savvy advice!	For some strange reasons, I am always attracted by books with the magical number `7' (seven) in the titles or sub-titles. Remarkably, they often turn out to be great stuff. Some of these books have already been reviewed here & there are more to come. Partly, my obsession with the number has probably to do with my impressionable exposure since I was a kid.<br /><br />When I was twelve in the early 60's, my first `blood-thirsty' movie was the Japanese cult classic, The Seven Samurais, which reportedly inspired the Hollywood epic, The Magnificent Seven. Both movies became my perennial favourites & I have seen them countless times. In both movies, a ragtag group of fearless fighters helped a poor village to deal with & outsmart a gang of marauding rogues.<br /><br />In this book, the magical `7' (seven) takes on a more serious & sober stance. It refers to the critical attributes that are embodied in the seven resources & skills necessary for your kids/teens to become capable - responsible, respectful, & resourceful - in dealing with today's complex world.<br /><br />Firstly, let me reveal the author's Significant Seven resources & skills of capable students:<br /><br />- strong perceptions of personal capabilities;<br />- strong perceptions of personal significance;<br />- strong perceptions of personal influence;<br />- strong interpersonal skills;<br />- strong intrapersonal skills;<br />- strong systemic skills;<br />- strong judgment skills;<br /><br />I have always hold the view that understanding perception is the key to peak performance.<br /><br />Maxwell Maltz started the ball rolling by coining the term as `psycho-cybernetics', even though ancient masters in the East have known about it for a very long time. Edward de Bono, the guru of lateral thinking, calls it 'First Order Thinking'. Steven Covey relates some insightful anecdotes about perception in his `7 Habits for Highly Effective People.' Joel Arthur Barker, a process futurist/consultant, considers perceptual understanding as one of five strategic tools necessary for navigating your future. Other consultants, like Mark Brown, Philip Kirby, to name a few, have talked at length about the intricacies of perception & their impact on personal as well as business (or organizational) performance. In the field of stress management, the research people at Institute of HeartMath, creator of the cutting-edge Freeze-Framer Technology,  have linked `stress' to `perception'. Even in the world of esoteric practices, Harry Palmer, creator of the expensive Avatar training program, thinks along the same lines, as far as reality creation is concerned.<br /><br />Henceforth, it is exciting for me to note that these two authors have drawn an excellent & compelling parallel in the academic arena.<br /><br />I fully concur with the authors that, in the case of our children,  strong perceptions of one's personal capabilities, personal significance & personal influence are the precursors to building one's strong assets in dealing with a world that is hurtling at us with breakneck speed, & compounded by hurricane-force changes.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the book, written by two educators by profession, is presented in very clear, easy-to-understand language.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to all parents & teachers. This book can help you develop the resources & skills for your children/students to become capable adults.<br /><br />I would go further to recommend parents & teachers to take a look at the following books, as supplementary reading:<br /><br />1. What Kids Need to Succeed: Proven, Practical Ways to Raise Good Kids, by Peter Benson;<br />2. What Young Children Need to Succeed: Working Together to Build Assets from Birth to Age 11, by Jolene Roehlkapartain;<br />3.

Having read Jennifer James' 'Thinking in the Future Tense: A Workout for the Mind', I naturally would want to compare the former book with this one.<br /><br />In the former book, she outlines specific strategies for dealing with change and preparing for the future. They include:<br /><br />- Seeing new things from a different perspective;<br /><br />- Recognizing the trends & driving forces, & predicting what the future holds;<br /><br />- Harnessing the power to switch & change one's myths, symbols & stories;<br /><br />- Speeding up your response time to change & react quickly;<br /><br />- Understanding the past to know the future & develop positive leadership skills for the future;<br /><br />- Doing more with more or less by keeping a balanced lifestyle & maintaining positive energy in your life & workplace;<br /><br />- Mastering new forms of intelligence e.g. unlocking the power of one's thinking to allow for future tasking;<br /><br />- Profiting from diversity by recognising its power to bring broader perspectives to a problem;<br /><br />which are very clear-cut to me. However, in this book, the twenty strategies (or guideposts) she wants to share with readers are apparently - & very deeply - enshrined in the world's great spiritual traditions - Christian, Judaic, Buddhlist, Muslim, Native American, Hindu.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed reading this book, I find pinning down the twenty strategies into precise forms take temendous mental effort, even though the author has specified at the onset that there are twenty steps, from awakening to transformation. I have to keep playing with my mind's responses as I read each chapter. A real workout for the mind! The examples given in some chapters also not that illuminating, when compared to the first book.<br /><br />Maybe the author is right: Some of us like to start out with armchair journeys rather than real ones. I may have to join a group that explores the twenty steps & prepares people for vision quests or seek a personal guide from my own school. I may have to ponder over these issues.<br /><br />Frankly, I still prefer the former book.still prefer the former book.	2005-09-19

It is written in crisp language - clear, concise & succinct. As you read each 'advice', you may have to ponder a little.<br /><br />For example, #189: The doorway is part of the Wall<br /><br />\\"Opportunity often appears as part of the run of things. It is easily overlooked, for it does not stand apart or call attention to itself. What seems to be an obstacle, a limitation, contains within it the opportunity you want. Look carefully at that wall. Study it until it reveals its openings to you. The best opening goes through, not around, the limitations & challenges you perceive.\\"<br /><br />I had some illuminations & revelations while going through this pocket book, which I jot them down dutifully in the margins.	2005-09-19

A truly masterpiece!	As part of my relentless pursuit of tools & strategies to turbo-charge my own reading performance, & ultimately, to improve my success coaching to kids/teens/adults, I am constantly on the lookout for books & other resources in bookstores as well as on the net. I came across this amazing book while straying into the website of ASCD (Association for Supervision & Curriculum Development), a worldwide, non-profit educational association dedicated to the success of every learner. Not only I bought the book from them, but also became a member of ASCD.<br /><br />I already know how to summarize, & am proud to say that I am pretty good at it, too, but I didn't know there are 50 ways to do it. They are systematically arranged in an alphabetical order for easy & quick reference. Each & every technique is fully described & with varied forms in the pages that follow. In fact, the author has even provided a reference Chart of Summarisation Techniques.<br /><br />In a nutshell, summarization is the act of restating essential information from text or an experience in as few words as possible or in a new, yet efficient, manner. I have always thought that summarization must be done in writing. This book tells me:  YES! it can be done in writing, but also orally, dramatically, artistically, visually, physically, musically, in groups or individually.<br /><br />The author, a teacher with twenty-four years of teaching experience, has contributed a masterpiece to the world of reading.<br /><br />The book, printed in large format, is written primarily as a comprehensive instruction & resource guide for English & reading teachers. For the teacher, this is definitely a great tool for enhancing not only their own lecturing methods, but their students' learning & performance.<br /><br />For the student, relating what has been observed or experienced in a clear, succinct manner, orally or in written form, is a helpful skill to master. More critically, when they attend lecture or read or writing news articles, identifying the salient information, no matter what subject they pursue & structuring that information for meaning & successful application, are not only part of effective study skills, but will serve as effective life skills in the long term.<br /><br />In a knowledge-based economy, workers must be able to read or perceive something, then make sense of it by manipulating the information, reorganize it, & applying it to a new situation. They must constantly & freely explore new ideas & analyse them. This process is similar to the one journalists use to relate the daily news.<br /><br />Summarisation is indeed a real world skill.<br /><br />Learning the 50 techniques may be daunting at first, but the payoff is great. As a success coach to kids/teens, I can testify to this.<br /><br />Most of the techniques can be adapted & enhanced, with a little imagination, for use with non-academic materials, so professionals in business & industry can learn & master them, too.<br /><br />To help the reader in summarization savvy, the author has included special instructional practices for teachers in the beginning chapter. In addition, the author has also presented a special section on paraphrasing. I concur with the author that paraphrasing is fundamental to creating summaries. I must highlight that these additions are truly excellent pieces of work by the author.<br /><br />At the end of the book, there are sample texts & summarization practice activities. The Resources is also a goldmine of information.<br /><br />This is not a book that you can just read in one go. You have to work on it as you read. You have to do a lot of thinking & reflecting. The author puts this in perspective at the onset: \\"AS YOU READ THIS BOOK, PLEASE STOP AT REGULAR INTERVALS & SUMMARISE WHAT YOU'VE READ.\\"<br /><br />Attention readers, irrespective of whether you are a student or a teacher, or a working professional in business & industry, I strongly urge you to get hold of this book. You will be summarization-savvy in no time, just like what I have achieved.urge you to get hold of this book.

Daydreaming is a very fascinating phenomenon. For as long as I can remember, I have been a daydreamer. According to experts, daydreams are \\"coded communications\\" which can yield abundant clues, when examined, about ourselves & our hidden needs, desires & potential.<br /><br />Ever since I have read about Albert Einstein's daydreaming ventures which eventually inspired him to fine-tune his famous Theory of Relativity, I have been hooked by this subject.<br /><br />This book is one of my first books on the subject. I acquired it because, firstly, it was written by a highly-respected psychoanalyst & psychotherapist, which gives the book some credibility. Secondly, I was trying to tie up some \\"loose ends\\" in my understanding - & further application - of strategic thinking & scenario planning.<br /><br />In the three leading books, among many others, on strategic thinking & scenario planning, namely, `The Art of the Long View:  Planning for the Future in an Uncertain World', by Peter Schwartz, 'Scenarios: the Art of Strategic Conversations', by Kees van der Heijden, & `The Living Company: Habits for Survival in a Turbulent Business Environment', by Arie de Geus, there was specific mention about the work of Dr. David Ingvar, a neuro-scientist in Sweden, concerning `memories of the future.' In short, he talked about the brain's innate ability to anticipate the future through imagined stories (or scenarios).<br /><br />Parallel in my relentless pursuit, I have read & digested a few brain books by another neuro-scientist, Dr. William Calvin. He talked about `ballistic prowess\\": in short, the brain's natural propensity for strategic visioning (thinking about the future).<br /><br />This book, especially Part 1:<br /><br />- what is a daydream;<br />- understanding the symbols in your daydreams;<br />-  searching for the familiar in the unfamiliar;<br />- using daydreams to cope with fears;<br />- how day dreams & night dreams connect;<br />- using your daydreams at work;<br /><br />has enlightened me tremendously, particularly to the application of daydreaming at work & to its practical connection to strategic thinking & scenario planning processes.<br /><br />Now I know, daydreaming is more subtle, whereas strategic thinking & scenario planning are more deliberate attempts. Combining all these approaches in a systematic manner & synconvergently (with apologies to Michael Gelb), & as part of further experimentation, I want to make more deliberate conscious as well as subtle unconscious attempts to allow the more vital, hidden clues to surface. This will serve as my work in progress as I continue to pursue better understanding of these subjects through reading & experimentation.<br /><br />The author's suggested practice exercises are well-thought of & the recommended personal dream journal is certainly a helpful aid.<br /><br />Despite the `new-agey' connotations of daydreaming, I am impressed that the author has blessed readers with a straight-forward, comprehensible, intelligent exposition of the value of daydreams. With my personal inputs on strategic thinking & scenario planning, as outlined above, I trust readers will now have a better perspective.tion of daydreaming at work & to its practical connection to strategic thinking & scenario planning processes.

The Art of Napping, by William Anthony;<br /><br />Ever since I have read Jeff Davidson's Breathing Space: Living & Working @ a Confortable Space in a Sped Up Society, many years ago, I have always valued - & benefitted tremendously from - the power of time-out.

In a nutshell, these are his fun stuff:<br /><br />- profiles in napping (stories of legendary nappers, including JFK, Winston Churchill, Thomas Edision, Napoleon Bonaparte, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan!);<br />- napping strategies (noice to advanced levels);<br />- nap management (getting the most from your naps);<br />- the future of napping;<br /><br />In some way, this book reinforces the chapter on 'The Art of Napping' in the first book. While the first book is beautifully illustrated by the co-author's photographs, the second book has several funny & bone-tickling cartoons.<br /><br />To sum up my review, I want to say that these two books (plus, Jeff Davidson's book)are excellent handy guides for the time-pressed, over-achieving generation.	2005-09-17

This book is actually part of a ten-book series on 'achieving high performance' for young adults. They come under Learning-a-Living Library, which comprises core subjects of, among others, understanding systems, self-management, leadership & organising information. These focused areas are very useful for todays' young adults to learn, develop & adopt as part of their lifestyles.<br /><br />Despite its compact size, only 64 pages, this book gives a good grounding to the subject of organising yourself i.e. finding, organising, presenting & using information to your best advantage, as follows:<br /><br />- finding information in school;<br /><br />- organising information in school;<br /><br />- organising your life;<br /><br />- organising your work environment;<br /><br />- keeping on top of jobs;<br /><br />- getting your job;<br /><br />- organising for performance;<br /><br />The young adult examples used are also very appropriate.<br /><br />Unfortunately, like all the other books in the series, the publisher has done a lousy job in picking photographs, mostly black & white, for illustrations in the book. Even the colour photograph on the front cover is visually unappealing. In today's multimedia savvy world, I just wonder how young readers can be quickly attracted by this good book. This is my only complaint about this book.<br /><br />I like the 'Questions to Ask Yourself' at the end of each chapter. They help the reader to focus on key points & then ponder, prior to personal application.<br /><br />The resource bibliography at the end of the book is quite useful for young readers to pursue further on the subject.<br /><br />On the whole, I rate a score of 4 for this book.<br /><br />I would recommend young readers to also peruse the following titles in the series:<br /><br />- High Performance through Understanding Systems;<br /><br />- High Perrformance through Self Management;<br /><br />- High Performance through Leadership;<br /><br />- High Performance through Effective Scheduling;ive Scheduling;  <br /> <br />	2005-09-17

I picked up this book in a used bookstore, again instinctively, after having read Veronique's The Art of Doing Nothing & William Anthony's The Art of Napping. Although the book does not offer really cutting-edge stuff, I find it fascinating, as it offers some useful advice for the peak performer.<br /><br />The subject of optimum performance technologies always intrigue me. Imagine we spend a third of our lives on sleeping. So naturally I want to find out how to do it better so that I can stay awake longer.<br /><br />Despite the author's tendency for mundane rambling throughout the book, I find the chapters explaining the golden rules of sleep & introducing the twenty great sleep strategies are the most interesting.<br /><br />I recommend this book, as complementary reading to the books mentioned at the beginning of this review. Another book to read is Jeff Davidson's Breathing Space. They offer great (stress relieving) stuff for our time-pressed, over-achieving society.	2005-09-17

This is a syntopic review of two books with similar topics but diverse approaches:<br /><br />1. Taking the Anxiety Out of Taking Tests: A Step by Step Guide, by Susan Johnson;<br />2. Addressing Test Anxiety in High Stakes Environment: Strategies for Classroom & Schools, by Gregory Cizek & Samantha Burg;<br /><br />The first book is written by a pracitising Buddhist & student of Eastern thought. So her book contains, in some areas, seemingly esoteric stuff (or `new agey' as some people may want to call it). Her book is targeted at laymen.<br /><br />The second book is written by two testing specialists, better known in scientific circles as psychometicians.(They love tests!)  Naturally, their approach is more methodical & clinical (despite the authors' denial at the onset). Their book is apparently targeted at fellow educators & school professionals.<br /><br />My purpose of acquiring (& reviewing) these two books is to learn more about strategies to tackle test anxiety, as part of my work as a success coach to kids/teens/adults.<br /><br />In the first book, the author has done a marvelous job of gathering the most effective awareness & relaxation techniques (a mixture of cognitive & behavioural) combined with effective study skills into one small paperback volume. The repertoire of techniques offered is very comprehensive. They are described in Chapters 2, 3, 4 & 5. Readers may find some of the techniques to be quite esoteric. The best way is to experiment with them & stick to those that work best for you.<br /><br />In Chapter 6, she describes the process of procrastination. I like the author's opening paragraph in this chapter: \\"Almost everyone who suffers from test testing anxiety had developed the practice of procrastination into a fine art...\\" This is a very important chapter. The author continues by showing how the reader can more effectively manage self, set goals, organize priorities, plan strategy & take action to deal with procrastination.<br /><br />In chapter 7, she describes the learning process & memory management. Her treatment of this area is excellent. I concur with her statement that the most important study technique is tracking your thoughts & the key to working though test taking is to develop awareness of your thoughts & physical sensations moment by moment. Her dovetailing of information to suit the student's intents & purposes is marvelous. This particular chapter should be read in conjunction with & by reflecting on the opening chapter 1, as the author talks about working with anxiety & fear.<br /><br />At the end of the book, there is a goldmine of information, but the reader needs to acquire or maybe browse the Further Resources in a public library.<br /><br />What I like about this whole book, on top of an unique distillation of proven techniques, is the author's logically structured exercises for stress management, as well as her step-by-step instructions to combat test anxiety. For the student reader, this is a boon.<br /><br />In the second book, & in line with its intents & purposes set out by the authors, the treatment of the topic is very much broader as well as very much deeper. For a layman, this may seem to be a scholarly piece of work, in which the authors describe:<br /><br />- Testing in a high stakes environment (chapter 1);<br />- What test anxiety is...& isn't (chapter 2);<br />- The effects of text anxiety on students & teachers (chapter 3);<br />- The causes of test anxiety (chapter 4);<br />- The measurement of test anxiety (chapter 5)(YES! there are tests for test anxiety! More details are given by the authors in the companion appendix);<br /><br />In this respect, readers may have to contend with plenty statistical correlations.<br /><br />Only in chapter 6 do the authors outline the tips & strategies for reducing test anxiety. Although the authors start off with a good overview of interventions for test anxiety, their treatment on study & test-taking skills as an interventionstrategy is more of a broad-brush, when compared with the first book. Nevertheless, the author's exposition of Thirteen Testing Myths in this chapter is an excellent piece of work. In the eyes of the teacher or educator, I reckon this chapter would be highly rated, as the authors move on to highlight strategies for promoting a healthy (test) assessment environment.<br /><br />In the concluding chapter 7, the authors provide useful checklists of intervention strategies, one for teachers, & one for parents.<br /><br />The Appendix & References pages are a goldmine of useful information for the teacher or educator.<br /><br />What I like about this book, on top of its straightforward explanations, practical suggestions & reasonable recommendations for addressing test anxiety, is the spotlight of key ideas, a total of eighteen, captured in boxed selections, & interspersed throughout the whole book. These help the reader to zero-in quickly on to the essentials.<br /><br />To sum up my syntopic review, I would like to rate both books a 5 each for their respective content strength & reader friendliness. As far I am concerned, I have enjoyed perusing both books. In my view, they also meet the intents & purposes of the respective author - & definitely my expectations as a success coach to kids/teens/adults.<br /><br />I therefore strongly recommend the first book for the student &/or parent (who wants to be a learning facilitator at home); whereas the second book is more appropriate for the teacher or educator.en Testing Myths in this chapter is an excellent piece of work.

This book, printed in large format, is originally intended as a comprehensive instructional guide for teachers & reading instructors, to teach students (in grades 9 to12) how to extract & comprehend information from simple passages as well as complex or advanced reading materials.<br /><br />I did not peruse this book in its entirety as my primary interest is only to find out, learn more about,  & then master the seven reading strategies, since I have a passion for reading. Also, I am always looking out for new ways to enhance my own reading pursuits.<br /><br />In a nut shell, with the execution of the seven strategies, it is designed to help teachers to become strategic teachers & students to become strategic readers. To put in simple terms, a strategic teacher/reader employs a repertoire of effective strategies in his/her respective pursuits. The seven strategies have their deep roots in scientifically based research.<br /><br />In reality, I have read & reviewed only the first three chapters, as follows:<br /><br />Chapter 1: The Power of Strategy Reading Instruction;<br />Chapter 2: Becoming a Strategic Teacher;<br />Chapter 3: Understanding the Seven Strategies;<br /><br />& have a quick scan of the remaining chapters, particularly those pages with instructional templates, instructional activities & reproducible forms.<br /><br />So, essentially, chapter 3 is my prime target, which outlines at great length & in depth, the critical attributes of the seven strategies, as follows: (Chapter 3 is actually a crash course for me!)<br /><br />Strategy #1: Activating prior knowledge;<br />Strategy #2: Inferring - reading the lines, between the lines & beyond the lines;<br />Strategy #3: Monitoring-Clarifying - probing the text, thinking & reflecting;<br />Strategy #4: Questioning the author, peers & teachers through self-questioning & formulating questions;<br />Strategy #5: Searching sources - Selecting responses;<br />Strategy #6: Summarising the reading;<br />Strategy #7: Visualising-Organising - constructing mental images &/or graphics organisers;<br /><br />These are the real gems of this book & I have benefited tremendously as a strategic reader as well as a strategic reading coach. I have in fact adapted many of the cognitive strategies in my coaching of kids/teens/adults in the areas of mastering information as well as effective study skills.<br /><br />For the teacher (or parent who yearns to be a learning facilitator at home), & in the light of my own personal & professional experiences, I dare to say this book is a very pragmatic instructional guide. I seldom see a book so packed with instructional aids. Chapter 5 shows you how to organize for strategic reading instruction in your classroom. The last chapter lays out a school-wide implementation model. The references at the back of the book are a goldmine of information.<br /><br />The author, with an impeccable track record (teacher, librarian, principal, superintendent, author of 35 books for parents & educators, consultant)  has certainly contributed a masterpiece to the world of reading!These are the real gems of this book & I have benefited tremendously as a strategic reader as well as a strategic reading coach.

I am quite disappointed by this new book & with the two authors, whose past work I am most familiar with. Having read (& reviewed with gusto!) the principal author's two earlier pieces of work i.e. Mapping InnerSpace, I find this book to be somewhat of a letdown.<br /><br />It is natural that I would compare this book with `Mapping InnerSpace.'  Much of the material in the new book has apparently been rehashed from the earlier work.  The only new stuff I can find is the `symbolary' of easy-to-draw iconographs, which is now been re-organized from A to Z, & a handful of new `Mindscaping' application templates in the last chapter. That's it.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the authors even continue to make use of the same Foreword, which goes back to the late 80's & which appeared in the first book.<br /><br />I get this funny feeling that the new book has been based on perfunctory desk research & no attempt has been exerted to conduct some real field research to cover new developments or advancements. Worst of all, & sad to say, the material is still restricted to the authors' own limited field of work.<br /><br />Based on my own exploration, the field of visual thinking has obviously made tremendous progress in the last few years, in both the educational & business arenas. A quick search & browse across the net will give readers a good appreciation of what has happened/is happening out there.<br /><br />I actually expect the authors to provide a quick round-up (or snapshot) of developments & happenings with regard to new & exciting visual thinking applications across the educational as well as business realms. There have been abundant application variations as well as radical enhancements in the field of visual thinking for business professionals. I am well aware that field research is no easy task in the light of many proprietary methods, but with a little ingenuity & persistent legwork, it would have been rewarding for both authors to go the extra mile. The new book, taking into consideration the prevailing developments outside their own sphere, would have been great for all the readers, especially the professionals.<br /><br />For examples, the creative work of heavy weights in the field of visual thinking as applied to business & industry, like Jim Channon (large system imagineering with Advanced Visual Language), David Sibbet (graphical visualisation of organisational change with template-based methodology) & Matt Taylor (creative augmentation, with artful integration of visual space technologies, collaborative environments, & knowledge-intensive work processes), to name a few, have not been captured &/or exemplified. Not even in the Resources page.

The Mind-manager software quickly comes to mind. Xplanations is another innovative one. There are many others, too.<br /><br />In these respects, the book does not stand up to its title, Visual Thinking: Tools for Mapping Your Ideas.<br /><br />For the beginner, particularly a teacher or a parent or a student, who is currently looking for plain visual thinking approaches, this book still stands as great work. I would attribute this to the wonderful symbolary.<br /><br />To sum up my review, I reluctantly rate this book a 3 in the light of my foregoing comments, although it deserves a 5 in terms of useful & practical learning for the beginner in the field of visual thinking.evelopments outside their own sphere, would have been great for all the readers, especially the professionals.

I bought this great book more as a reference book to complement as well as supplement many of the author's wonderful study skill books, e.g. Winning the Study Game, Study Max & Study Wise currently in my possession.<br /><br />In a nut shell, it explains more than seventy types of learning difficulties & disruptive behaviours to learning.<br /><br />For the parent who yearns to be a learning facilitator at home, I strongly recommend it. It's a comprehensive guide to understanding your child's interests & needs as well as reasons for strugling in school, if any.<br /><br />The whole book is packed with vital information & invaluable insights, which are very systematically organised for quick reference. It's also very well written. All the definitions of terminology & professional jargon used in the book are very clear, concise & succinct.<br /><br />With 30 years of teaching in the field of learning & learning difficulties, & a stable of 18 books, the author is certainly knowledgeable.<br /><br />As a success coach to kids/teens/adults, I often use the author's works as my supporting aids.	2005-09-13

Over the years, I note that most of the pocket books (which I have acquired!) published by Barron's Educational Series, Inc., for students often turn out to be very useful & practical for their intents & purposes. To name a few: Student Success Secrets, B's & A's in 30 Days, both by Eric Jensen; Creative Problem Solving by Donald Noone; Maximising Your Memory Power by Danielle Lapp.<br /><br />This pocket book is no exception. It's very well written. It's also now in its fifth edition & expanded to over 400 pages.<br /><br />Although I am still intrigued by the fact that the goal setting aspect is missing from this book, the treatment of all the other aspects of study skills is excellent. All the chapters are well-organised. They are clear, concise & succinct. The specific chapters on writing, vocabulary building, spelling & punctuation, research, library usage & test taking are relatively good. There is also a chapter on using technology. The last chapter on motivation (How to find it; How to use it) is a must read for students!<br /><br />I would recommend students in high school & college to get hold of this pocket book, as well as Sean Covey's 'Seven Habits for Highly Effective Teens'! The latter, in addition to enhancing your priority management, is to help you fill up the missing variable in the study (success) equation: goal setting!!!<br /><br />On the whole, & for a handy pocket guide, I rate it a 5.	2005-09-13

I often buy bulk copies of this wonderful book to give away to young kids who attend my 5-Day hands-on learning camp, aptly entitled 'Science & The Art of Discovery.' My principal objective is to teach young kids how to think scientifically, inventively & productively.<br /><br />The two authors have done a great job in producing this excellent piece of work. Although it has only 44 pages, the contents are comprehensively rich. It is also very well-illustrated with a simple story format & systematically organised as follows:<br /><br />How do you answer questions?<br /><br />Using the scientific method<br /><br />What do you want to know?<br /><br />What do you think?<br /><br />If you want to get your young kids to understand & appreciate the scientific method or simply 'how to think like a scientist', go for this book!	2005-09-13

At first glance, the book gives the cursory impression that it is a detective novel.<br /><br />Drawing an analogy, i.e. applying the principles taught by this book, the reader's initial impression is not totally wrong.<br /><br />If I am allowed to play with key words, this book shows you how to become a \\"detective\\": to detect what is around you, your backyard, on this Planet Earth. It provides you with \\"novel\\" approaches, with the use of the accompanying jeweler's loupe (5x magnification), to help you to observe & think about the world around you, draw an analogy, theorise a model, solve  a(ny) problem(s), compose & write a report, stay in focus, communicate to & discuss your findings & with others.<br /><br />It then takes the reader on a journey of discovery that incorporates mathematics, science, social sciences, art, literature, and creative writing & inventive thinking, plus some wit & humour, which encapsulates the intended inter-disciplinary curriculum.<br /><br />In comparison with `How to Think Like a Scientist', by Stephen Kramer, which I have reviewed earlier,  I would say this pleasant book puts (or pushes) the scientific thinking processes to work, right in your backyard. The book, not only explains the scientific method in greater depth, and demonstrates real-world applications with simple everyday tools, it helps the reader to develop a multi-disciplinary mind towards understanding & appreciating our beautiful planet.<br /><br />There are plenty of photographs & illustrations in the book. At this particular juncture, I disagreed with one reviewer who lamented that this book was \\"messy.\\" Bear in mind, \\"messy\\" is the starting (or flash) point for problem solving & creative thinking. A springboard for the Private Eye Program!<br /><br />To share with readers who are teachers (or parents who want to be learning facilitators at home), I would like to add that this book actually provides me with the terrific framework to design my 5-day learning camp for young kids (from primary four to six), aptly entitled, `Science & The Art of Discovery.' In addition to the jeweler's loupe, each participating kid gets a copy of `How to Think like a Scientist', as well as a disposable camera, a Einstein note-pad, a 4-colour writing pen, a large pack of colour markers, 100-gm A3 size multi-colour art blocks, sticker labels, scissors & glue sticks, together with unlimited access to Googolplex & K'nex construction components.<br /><br />To sum up, & if you are just looking for a simple working or implementation model to put the scientific method to work, right in your own backyard, this is it!

The two authors, who apparently have impeccable track records from the exciting world of inventions & innovations, have done an marvellous job in producing this excellent piece of work.<br /><br />The subject of inventing has always fascinated me. I have even amassed a large collection of books & other resources on inventing. This is also partly due to my own training as a mechanical engineer. On inventions, I am one who is always keen to find out & study what goes inside the heads (i.e the thinking processes) of inventors & innovators.<br /><br />This book is very rich & comprehensively detailed in its contents, pertaining to all the 'what you need to know about inventing & inventions'. It is full of useful advice & fascinating ideas for the novice inventor. It teaches you to invent & innovate.<br /><br />In the introductory chapter 1, the authors posed this question: Can You be an Inventor.\\" In their own words, \\"Yes, you can. Almost anyone can. Your talent may be hidden, but we are going to show you how to use it.\\"<br /><br />In a nutshell, let me extract the essence of this book by using one of the authors (Bob Symes) Combined Rules of Invention:<br /><br />Rule 1:<br /><br />Identify the problem.<br /><br />Invent for tommorow.<br /><br />Rule 2:<br /><br />Meet a need.<br /><br />Don't be before your time.<br /><br />Rule 3:<br /><br />Keep on learning.<br /><br />Experience is never wasted.<br /><br />Rule 4:<br /><br />Check for originality.<br /><br />Join a network.<br /><br />Rule 5:<br /><br />Build a working model.<br /><br />Prove your invention works.<br /><br />Rule 6:<br /><br />Don't attack established inteest.<br /><br />Don't become a dead hero.<br /><br />Rule 7:<br /><br />Learn the patent system.<br /><br />Operate the system.<br /><br />Rule 8:<br /><br />Find a product champion.<br /><br />Get a manufacturer's backing.<br /><br />Rule 9:<br /><br />Sell yourself as well as the invention.<br /><br />Success depends on the inventor.<br /><br />Rule 10:<br /><br />Persevere.<br /><br />Persistence leads to success.<br /><br />These combined rules serve as practical guiding principles if you want to embark on a journey into inventions. The entire book goes about explaining, elaborating, substantiating & illustrating these ten combined rules, by using real-world case studies, in all the following chapters. Throughout the book, it is also packed with inspiring stories as real inventors struggled to get their work acknowledged by the world.<br /><br />The authors' writing is basically conversational style, so reading the book is quite a breeze.<br /><br />The last two chapters provide some valuable resources & contacts.<br /><br />I have personally adapted some of the inventing stuff here (& of course, from elsewhere) in a hands-on course I have created & conducted for young kids, in the form of a 5-day camp, aptly called 'Science & The Art of Discovery'. My purpose was to teach young kids how to think scientifically, inventively & productively.<br /><br />In summing up, I like to rate this wonderful book a 5.<br /> <br />These combined rules serve as practical guiding principles if you want to embark on a journey into inventions.

This book is actually a Student Workbook. On its own, it is almost useless, unless you combine its use with the Teachers Manual. Then, this workbook will make some sense. In combination, they are supposed to serve as integral part of the Cambridge Stratford Study Skills Course, designated as the 10-Hour Course, targetted primarily at pre-college students.<br /><br />Content-wise, it is relatively similar to  'Study Wise: A Program for Maximising Your Learning Potential' by Lawrence Greene, which I have reviewed earlier. I strongly suggest readers to get hold of this latter book, which is a complete study skills book on its own. Its coverage on critical thinking skills is also more indepth & comprehensive.<br /><br />If you are still in the middle to high school grades, then 'Study Max: Improving Study Skills,' also by Lawrence Greene, would be a better choice.<br /><br />I want to add that, across the board, treatment of each aspect of study skills: goal setting, time management, memorisation, speed reading, reading for comprehension, vocabulary building, listening skills, note taking & test taking, by the author (Greene) in both books (Study Wise & Study Max) is more finely detailed.<br /><br />In terms of reader friendliness & action-packed learning, both books are also excellent.	2005-09-11

Somehow, I managed to lay my hands on an used copy of this book, which I have found by chance on the net. It was written in the 1970s & based on some fourteen years' of teaching experience by the staff of Baldridge Reading & Study Skills Inc. In other words, its origins may go back to mid-1950s, but I note that the inside stuff are still very relevant in today's information-rich world.<br /><br />Frankly, I am very impressed by the contents of this book. Prior to this, & in the light of my deep passion for reading & books, I have not seen a book on reading strategies so finely detailed & systematically organized.<br /><br />The seven basic strategies (some of which are broken down into component techniques) in the book refer to:<br /><br />- survey reading (as a pre-reading technique);<br /><br />- speed reading (reading for specific information);<br /><br />- phrase reading (reading for thematic ideas within paragraphs or sections);<br /><br />- close reading (reading with annotations, focusing on summarizing & paraphrasing ideas);<br /><br />- inquiry (questioning the author);<br /><br />- critical reading (reading the lines, reading between the lines & reading beyond the lines);<br /><br />- esthetic reading (for the enjoyment of literature);<br /><br />with each strategy covered in a specific chapter. Since reading is a complex activity, & no single approach, not even the seven strategies, can meet the demands of all reading situations, the author has generously shared his expert tips on developing a reading approach, i.e. combining component techniques with basic strategies. This is obviously a marvelous idea.<br /><br />In addition, there are seven supplementary chapters that touch on study skills (e.g. study scheduling, overcoming reading obstacles, test taking, research writing & vocabulary development). Also, suggestions for applying some of the reading strategies to several different academic disciplines (social sciences, physical sciences, languages, linguistics & humanities) are illustrated in the form of easy-to-read, quick-reference charts. For the college student, these are real gems. There are also practice exercises & a summary at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />As part of vocabulary development, the book even lists out 1,000 words which every college student must know. Cool!<br /><br />I get this funny feeling that many of the current speed reading books in the marketplace may have drawn their material, in some way, from this wonderful book.) are illustrated in the form of easy-to-read, quick-reference charts.

For the purpose of a syntopic review, I will classify this book as the other half of a pair of parenting books from the same publisher that also includes A Parent's Guide: help your Teenager succeed at School, by Michael Papworth. Thus, I will write a review of this latter book separately.<br /><br />This book helps the reader make sense of primary schools today by providing practical advice & information, through real-life examples & interviews with parents, teachers & education experts.<br /><br />In a nut shell, this is the layout of chapters:<br /><br />- 1. The Education System;<br />- 2. Pre-school Education;<br />- 3. Choosing a School;<br />- 4. Your Relationship with the School;<br />- 5. What Your Child Learns;<br />- 6.

Resources;<br /><br />As you can see from the foregoing, the coverage is relatively extensive & yet comprehensive enough for a book of this size, about 150 odd pages. Each & every conceivable parenting aspect (or need) is consistently well treated by the author.<br /><br />There are a quick review, as well as action exercises, at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />I would like to add that Chapter 5, 6 & 7 give parents a pretty good understanding of your kid from the learning perspective. Chapter 8, although it is limited in scope,  is targeted at teachers. Nevertheless, it gives you some insight into a teacher's job & how you as a parent can work with teachers to support your child's education.<br /><br />Chapter 9, on Special Needs, also limited in scope in the light of the current book size, is also quite enlightening for parents who are facing such difficulties.<br /><br />The resources at the end of the book are commendable, but they are tied to the British system. The same applies to Chapter 11: Getting Ready for Secondary School<br /><br />In my PTA talks, & because of the abundant tips & useful strategies, I often recommend this book, together with the other mentioned above, among others, to parents & guardians.<br /><br />To sum up, & if you are often confronted with these issues:<br /><br />- how can I choose the best primary school for my kid?<br />- What kind I do to become more involved in their education?<br />- Where should I go for help I fmy kid is having problems in school?<br /><br />Read this book & you will be better informed & happier as parents.other mentioned above, among others, to parents & guardians.

This whole book could easily be scaled-down into a magazine article. It is packed with too many personal anecdotes & other people's stories, the quantum of which seems to be an over-kill. To use the exact words of one reviewer, \\"a lot of irrelevant filler information\\".<br /><br />A close-up scrutiny of the `5 Easy Steps for Creating Wealth' reveals no big secrets.  These are the summary of the 5 Easy Steps (extracted from Page 176):<br /><br />- Know what you don't want;<br />- Select what you do want;<br />- Clear all negative or limiting beliefs;<br />- Feel what it would be like to have, do, or be what you want;<br />- Let go as you act on your intuitive impulses, & allow the results to manifest.<br /><br />Yes, that's it.<br /><br />In comparison, Napoleon Hill, in the 'Laws of Success', which outlined seventeen success principles, had already revealed them a long time ago. The 'Laws of Success' was based on the author's personal quest that spreaded over twenty years to study the most successful people around his time. It has even been highly acknowledged by Anthony Robbins & Stephen Covey, whose respective works adapted many of the author's original ideas.	2005-09-08

The title is somewhat a bit of a misnomer because it is a book about general study skills. The \\"exam secret\\" is confined to only one small chapter, i.e. Chapter 11, Examinations.<br /><br />To some extent, I reckon the book meets the intents & purposes as the author sets out clearly \\"the right ways\\" to plan your study time, read actively, make effective notes, & remember what you have learned. I would have expected the author to put in more meat in Chapter 11; Examinations. From this standpoint, this book fails in my expectations.<br /><br />The topics of Goal Setting, Lesson Revision & Stress Management are, surprisingly, missing from the book.<br /><br />Reading-wise, the book is relatively organized with a summary at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />Chapter 8: Minding Your Language,  is particularly useful for those readers who want to hone their mastery of the English language. Quite a good piece of work, I must add.<br /><br />As this is a British publication, some of the stuff, particularly the last chapter, applies to the British examination context.<br /><br />If I were to compare this book with Smart Learning: A Study Skills Guide for Teens, by William Christen, which I have reviewed earlier, the latter is a much better book to read.<br /><br />For \\"The Exam Secret\\", I would suggest to readers to pursue any of the following books:<br /><br />- Passing Exams without Anxiety, by David Aces;<br /><br />- How to Pass Your Exams, by Dominic O'Brien;<br /><br />- How to Pass Your Exams Every Time, by Mike Evans;<br /><br />- Passing Exams, by Dawn Hamilton;	2005-09-08

Thus, I will write the review of this latter book separately.<br /><br />This particular book helps the reader make sense of secondary schools today by providing practical advice & information, through real-life examples & interviews with parents, teachers & education experts.<br /><br />At the onset, the author reveals three basic ideas that run through this book:<br /><br />- Love conquers all i.e. parents must feel a deep love & affection for their children;<br />- Parents don't make their children do good by making them feel bad about themselves; with empathy & understanding, they must blend with their children & try to see the world through their eyes;<br />- The only way for parents to get their children to do what they want them to do is to help them want to do it;<br /><br />Against this backdrop of idea streams, the layout of chapters is organized as follows:<br /><br />- 1.

For the uninitiated, the lead author of this particular book (i.e. Neil Browne)  is actually the same author of `Asking the Right Questions (ARQ): A Guide to Critical Thinking', which has gone through seven editions to become, I believe, a highly successful critical thinking guide for students. Its primary focus is critical analysis & synthesis of information. If you have read the ARQ book, then reading this particular book is quite a breeze.<br /><br />In a nutshell, & with the deliberate merging of two synonymous areas - `critical thinking' with `active learning' -, this book strives to improve your mental performance in college. In essence, it strives to help you to become a strategic learner. A strategic learner always pursues excellence in his/her learning. He/she also always thinks through what he/she has learned.<br /><br />The authors have very skillfully elaborated & artfully illustrated the pursuit of excellence in learning along  the following three premises:<br /><br />- your attitude affect your learning;<br /><br />- your focus on knowledge about how to learn more effectively;<br /><br />- your role in maximizing the external environment;<br /><br />Under these three premises, the book chapters have been laid out as follows:<br /><br />- Taking charge of your own learning (Chapter 2);<br /><br />- Resisting the need to be entertained (Chapter 3);<br /><br />- Resisting mental habits that interfere with active learning (Chapter 4);<br /><br />- Taking pride in doubt (Chapter 5);<br /><br />- Asking questions to help make sense of the reasoning (Chapter 6);<br /><br />- Asking questions to evaluate the reasoning (Chapter 7);<br /><br />- Asking questions that make connections (Chapter 8);<br /><br />- Preparing for class where active learning takes place (Chapter 9);<br /><br />- Taking notes for active learning (Chapter 10);<br /><br />- Searching for clarity in texts, lectures, discussion & assignments (Chapter 11);<br /><br />- Finding peers who respect active learning (Chapter 12);<br /><br />- Adjusting to professors who seem not to encourage active learning (Chapter 13);<br /><br />- Discovering multiple perspectives (Chapter 14);<br /><br />As you can see from the chapter layout, there is natural progression as you learn & build on skills & knowledge, starting from the first chapter.  The author is very generous with expert tips. I find them very practical indeed, even for working professionals. There is also quick review box at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />For students, this is definitely a very good book to have with you.<br /><br />This book is targeted at college students. I want to add that it is also useful for any adult pursuing academic work.<br /><br />The authors' approach in writing this book is commendable: firstly, they give you a self-assessment; then help you to identify potential obstacles as you negotiate through college; & then, show you how to overcome them & finally, provide you with many possible solutions (tips) so that you can choose the ones that you think will work for you.<br /><br />Chapters 5, 6, 7 & 8 are superbly written, as most of the materials have been drawn from the lead author's earlier work. For the student, Chapter 9, 10 & 11 will be most useful in helping you to enhance & reinforce your study habits in college. Chapter 12, 13 & 14 show you how to maximize your external environment.<br /><br />My only adverse comment of this book is that Chapter 14 should have been expanded.  In my view, this chapter is too brief. The authors should have put in more meat here. From the standpoint of mental performance, holding multiple perspectives (including contrary & conflicting ones) in one's mind at all times is a very important success trait, not only in college but also in the working world. I am often reminded by this quotation of F Scott Fitzgerald: \\" The test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, & still retain the ability to function.\\"	2005-09-07

This is an excellent guide for those readers who want to adopt powerful study habits & who also want to pass their exams with flying colours.<br /><br />I am very impressed by the author's opening approach. At the onset, he starts off with a unique preamble as outlined in Chapter 1: How to Use This Book. He stresses the importance of asking questions as an initial guiding principle in reading his book (or any other books &/or reading materials), as follows:<br /><br />- Formulating questions about the topic as you read;<br />- Formulating questions about what you are doing & how you are proceeding with your reading;<br /><br />He even goes beyond by showing you how to formulate questions from the headings/sub-headings/first or last sentences of paragraphs in printed or written reading materials, using the well-know Rudyard Kipling method.<br /><br />In the same opening chapter, he even demonstrates, with two working examples, the process of asking questions as a technique for analyzing assignment question.  This is a very powerful technique to acquire for dissecting exam questions. (This technique is part of a larger process known by learning experts as the Question Dissection Protocol.)<br /><br />Other useful techniques are outlined by the author in the other chapters:<br /><br />- Chapter 2: Tackling coursework deadlines;<br />- Chapter 3: Organising your revision;<br />- Chapter 4: Improving your memory;<br />- Chapter 5: Taking exams;<br />- Chapter 6: Coping with anxiety;<br />- Chapter 7: Using others as supporting aids;<br /><br />Each chapter is prefaced with a problem checklist, which is a quick way for the reader to access specific information (pertaining to the appropriate technique to use) immediately from the respective chapter.  This makes the book a handy reference.<br /><br />As you can see, a full-scale chapter on lesson revision is incorporated in this book.  This chapter is beautifully crafted, covering the entire spectrum of the lesson revision process. This is definitely a rare occurrence for a study skill book, since I often notice that most authors of such kind of book tend to skip (or maybe they themselves are not aware of) this important aspect of the effective study process.<br /><br />Chapter 5 (Taking exams) & Chapter 6 (Coping with anxiety) are very well-researched & carefully thought of expositions by the author, backed with a vast array of techniques, tools & hints, although a few of which in Chapter 6 seem to be somewhat esoteric.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the techniques outlined by the author in both chapters are wide-ranging & all-encompassing. I have never seen a DIY Guide to Muscular Relaxation so finely detailed & systematically illustrated in a study skill book.<br /><br />The last chapter provides many useful guidelines for getting help from supporting aids in your academic pursuits.<br /><br />There is also a very rich bibliography & further reading list at the end of the book.<br /><br />Attention Readers: If you are a student, & you want to ace your exams with flying colours, grab hold of this book! The book is targeted as secondary students but I feel that the techniques can also be applied for adults preparing for further academic work.ice that most authors of such kind of book tend to skip (or maybe they themselves are not aware of) this important aspect of the effective study process.

I bought this book (used copy) on the net as part of my desk research into 'developing test/exam mastery', without realising that it is actually a cigarette-box size booklet. I was attracted by the sub-title 'how to pass exams the easy way'. It's written in a tongue-in-cheek way & I read it in less than 3 minutes. The treatment is very superficial. My advice to readers is DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this one. Please go for more serious books, like any one of the following:<br /><br />- How to Pass Your Exams Every Time, by Mike Evans;<br />- Passing Exams without Anxiety, by David Acres;<br />- How to Pass Exams, by Dominic O'Brien;<br />- Passing Exams, by Dawn Hamilton	2005-09-07

Most of the publications that come out of CCL (or Center for Creative Leadership), which I have acquired for my personal library, are seemingly well-supported by research findings & concisely written by the respective authors, who apparently hold impeccable track records in their fields. This particular book is one of them. (CCL has earned its #1 Rank in Leadership Education by Business Week).<br /><br />My primary interest in strategic leadership stems from my relentless search for better understanding of the thinking processes that go inside the heads of leaders. To be more precise, the strategy formulation processes!  This has been by burning passion for more than two decades.<br /><br />In this book, the authors have artfully as well as  logically demonstrated how readers can exercise effective strategic leadership through their distinctive & systematic approach:<br /><br />- strategic thinking (Chapter 2);<br />- strategic acting (Chapter 3);<br />- strategic influencing (Chapter 4);<br /><br />These serve as the synergistic driving forces. In the authors' own words: Driving strategy as a learning process.  (I am actually quite tempted to use the term, `syn-vergent' instead of `synergistic' [driving forces] as the former term was originally coined by Michael Gelb, in Thinking for a Change, which means `the art of balancing convergent and divergent thinking modes, logic and imagination, reason and intuition.' In the current book under review, the authors contend that strategic thinking engages the heart as well as the head.)<br /><br />With an excellent introduction in Chapter 1, Chapter 6 shows how readers can apply the above approach in the broader organizational context.<br /><br />Chapter 7 sums up the book: Becoming a Strategic Leader, using surfing as a metaphorical platform (I like it!) - keeping your balance while learning the best path to follow amid constantly changing conditions.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the authors discuss in depth the specific competencies & perspectives related to each of the above driving forces, as well as their interdependency in producing a more wholistic (or more appropriately, `syn-vergent', as explained above) & meaningful strategy.<br /><br />In conclusion as a whole from the standpoint of reader friendliness & action-packed learning, I rate this wonderful book a 5.<br /><br />So, readers, please add this book to your Strategic Thinker's Bookshelf.<br /><br />Attention Readers: To complement as well as to reinforce your understanding of Chapter 2 of this book, please read `Choosing the Future: The Power of Strategic Thinking', by Stuart Wells.ing forces, as well as their interdependency in producing a more wholistic (or more appropriately, `syn-vergent', as explained above) & meaningful strategy.

This is an excellent guide for those readers who want to adopt powerful study habits & who also want to pass their exams with flying colours.<br /><br />I am very impressed by the author's opening approach. At the onset, he starts off with a unique preamble as outlined in Chapter 1: How to Use This Book. He stresses the importance of asking questions as an initial guiding principle in reading his book (or any other books &/or reading materials), as follows:<br /><br />- Formulating questions about the topic as you read;<br />- Formulating questions about what you are doing & how you are proceeding with your reading;<br /><br />He even goes beyond by showing you how to formulate questions from the headings/sub-headings/first or last sentences of paragraphs in printed or written reading materials, using the well-know Rudyard Kipling method.<br /><br />In the same opening chapter, he even demonstrates, with two working examples, the process of asking questions as a technique for analyzing assignment question.  This is a very powerful technique to acquire for dissecting exam questions. (This technique is part of a larger process known by learning experts as the Question Dissection Protocol.)<br /><br />Other useful techniques are outlined by the author in the other chapters:<br /><br />- Chapter 2: Tackling coursework deadlines;<br />- Chapter 3: Organising your revision;<br />- Chapter 4: Improving your memory;<br />- Chapter 5: Taking exams;<br />- Chapter 6: Coping with anxiety;<br />- Chapter 7: Using others as supporting aids;<br /><br />Each chapter is prefaced with a problem checklist, which is a quick way for the reader to access specific information (pertaining to the appropriate technique to use) immediately from the respective chapter.  This makes the book a handy reference.<br /><br />As you can see, a full-scale chapter on lesson revision is incorporated in this book.  This chapter is beautifully crafted, covering the entire spectrum of the lesson revision process. This is definitely a rare occurrence for a study skill book, since I often notice that most authors of such kind of book tend to skip (or maybe they themselves are not aware of) this important aspect of the effective study process.<br /><br />Chapter 5 (Taking exams) & Chapter 6 (Coping with anxiety) are very well-researched & carefully thought of expositions by the author, backed with a vast as well as broad array of techniques, tools & hints, although a few of which in Chapter 6 seem to be somewhat esoteric.<br /><br />I must add that I have never seen a DIY Guide to Muscular Relaxation so finely detailed & systematically illustrated in a study skill book.<br /><br />The last chapter provides many useful guidelines for getting help from supporting aids in your academic pursuits.<br /><br />There is also a very rich bibliography & further reading list at the end of the book.<br /><br />Attention Readers: If you are a student, & you want to ace your exams with flying colours, grab hold of this book!

As a compact, handy, quick reference guide, this book certainly meets the intents & purposes of the authors, who are teachers, but who also happen to be parents themselves.<br /><br />The coverage is pretty broad-based, as readers can see from the chapter layout, as follows:<br /><br />- Back to School Tips;<br /><br />- Home-School Communication;<br /><br />- Routines to live by;<br /><br />- Health & Safety;<br /><br />- Homework & Tests;<br /><br />- Talents & Learning Styles;<br /><br />- Setting Goals;<br /><br />- Enrichment;<br /><br />- Personal Responsibility;<br /><br />- Getting along with Others;<br /><br />- Volunteering;<br /><br />- Holidays & Breaks;<br /><br />The practical  insider tips are written in short bursts to the many questions parents would often want to ask about their children's school experiences. In this respect, the authors have done quite a good job.<br /><br />However, parenting is a very serious affair. It is an accepted fact that parents are their children's first teachers & their homes are their children's first classrooms. The insider tips from this book alone cannot solve your parenting problems or issues. You have to read more seriously written books. Some of the books listed as further reading resources under FYI in this particular book are worth exploring.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, the publisher of this particular book, Free Spirit Publishing (website: [...] happens to have excellent books for the serious parent/reader. I would recommend a few:<br /><br />- What Young Children Need to Succeed, by Jolene Roehkepartain;<br /><br />- Playing Smart, by Susan Perry;<br /><br />- How to Help Your Child with Homework, by Jeanne Shay Schumm;<br /><br />Once you have peruse these serious books, then the insider tips from this particular book will become more useful & meaningful.<br /><br />For the purpose of scoring, I would rate this book a 4.	2005-09-06

I generally share most of the sentiments expressed by earlier reviewers who gave positive responses to this book.<br /><br />In the light of my own consultancy work, understanding the Opportunity Grid (Chapter 6) alone, with its many diverse applications in business, is worth the value of the whole book.<br /><br />Let me share a little secret with readers.  If you synergise the power of this Opportunity Grid (with some adaptation, of course) with the power tools introduced in 'Innovation Formula' by Michel Robert, your analytical as well as opportunity sensing capabilities become exponential. Trust me!<br /><br />The Opportunity Grid is really a brilliant piece of work by the author (even though it has its origins from George Steiner's pioneering work). Kudos!<br /><br />The author's artful illustration of Pareto's Law or the 80/20 Rule in business, although it is not a new concept, is refreshing.<br /><br />This wonderful book can be best summed up by using the author's own approach to strategic thinking, as outlined below:<br /><br />\\"Successful managers or succesful mangement teams focus on the four critical pieces of the strategic puzzle:<br /><br />- rather than try to accomplish \\"everything,\\" they diligently maintain F-O-C-U-S;<br />- they develop & maintain intimate understanding of their M-A-R-K-E-T-S;<br />- they truly care about their P-E-O-P-L-E;<br />- they carefully manage their P-R-O-C-E-S-S-E-S;<br /><br />This is one more good book to be added on to your Strategic Thinker's Bookshelf.<br /><br />As a conclusion, & without hesitation, I rate this book a 5.	2005-09-05

After several years of intensive search on the internet, I finally managed to lay my hands  on this wonderful book. It's a compact paperback, with only 160 odd pages, & packed with practice exercises.<br /><br />I consider it to be the best questioning toolkit for educational applications I have read so far.<br /><br />The book is written primarily for educational professionals. However, with some ingenuity, it can be easily adapted for business applications, as proven in my case as a strategic explorer.<br /><br />At the onset, the author says that the goal of the book is to help you become an effective, strategic questioner. This goal has been achieved in my case. The tools & strategies I have picked up from the author have helped me to produce excellent results in my consultancy work as well as facilitation practices.<br /><br />The most exciting section of the book is The Twenty Five Questioning Dialogues: A Manual of Questioning Techniques (Chapter 6). In essence, this section serves as the core taining manual for strategic questioning. They provide numerous, wide-ranging scenarios to improve your teaching, probing, learning & dialoguing skills. In addition, the Fifteen Specific Questioning Strategies (Chapter 5) & Five Overarching Ways to organise your Questions (Chapter 4) are real gems. You can use them to:<br /><br />- develop concepts;<br />- generalise observations/experiences;<br />- analyse a document;<br />- make predictions;<br />- explain working procedures;<br />- explain events;<br />- explain situations;<br />- analyse values & resolve value conflicts;<br />- clarify feelings or attitudes;<br />- take a stand on issues;<br /><br />Among all the books on questioning processes for educational applications in my personal library, this one book has been my prized catch.<br /><br />Readers can well understand why I rate it a 5 (unfortunately, the maximum available) although I want to rate it much higher.<br /><br />So, if you want to turbo-charge your questioning skills to the highest order, go for this book, even if you have to spend time, effort & money searching for it.money searching for it.	2005-09-05

This is the first time I have come across a student survival guide for PhD as well post-graduate students. I wish I had this book with me when I was doing a management course at London Business School two decades ago.<br /><br />The book actually consists of contributory chapters by expert lecturers (from the Institute of Cancer Research, all of whom have supervised students working towards their PhDs), as follows:<br /><br />- Effective Organisation & Time Management;<br />- Personal & Interpersonal Skills;<br />- Information Retrieval;<br />- Critical Reading;<br />- Presentations;<br />- Writing a Paper;<br />- Writing & defending your Thesis;<br /><br />According to the Preface, this book started life as a website for PhD students at the Institute of Cancer Research, the content of which has gone through some evolutions. In other words, the contents have been reviewed by many active PhD students. This revelation certainly makes the book more meaningful & useful for students with similar academic pursuits.<br /><br />All the chapters are well-crafted by the respective experts & systematically organised by the Editor, & are packed with practical advice & quick reference tips, as well as specific points to remember. Kudos to the editor & the respective authors!<br /><br />The text format & page layout used are quick-&-easy to read, which make the book very handy for research students with busy schedules.<br /><br />At the end of each chapter, there is also a checklist, a reading list & a list of web resources.<br /><br />For me as a strategic explorer & prolific reader, the most rewarding chapters are those on Information Retrieval & Critical Reading. They are superb stuff.<br /><br />On the whole, I rate it a 5 & I wish I could rate it higher.	2005-09-05

This book is targeted at teen students. It draws a lot of material from the `pop psychology' world of Norman Vincent Peale, Earl Nightingale, Napoleon Hill & Maxwell Maltz. So intended readers have to contend with a series of typical `mind-programming' pitches. They range from confidence/faith building to imagination/visualization practices. Nothing wrong with these, except that I feel the 50 odd pages dedicated to them are an over-kill, after considering that the book has 200 odd pages.<br /><br />On the whole, the requisite study strategies are appropriately covered, with the bulk in the second half of the book, as follows:<br /><br />- goal setting;<br /><br />- scheduling;<br /><br />- reading (with SQ3R) & vocabulary building;<br /><br />- mnemonics;<br /><br />- note taking (with Cornell method as well as mind-mapping);<br /><br />- test preparation & taking;<br /><br />However, the author only gives a perfunctory treatment on writing (only in the context of essay exams) & stress management (with a chapter on the goodness of sleep & the dangers of drugs, alcohol & other stimulants.)<br /><br />Nothing is mentioned about information gathering & lesson revision/rehearsal, which I believe are important components in the entire study process.<br /><br />When compared to Smart Learning: A Study Skills Guide for Teens, by William Christen, which I have reviewed earlier, the former book has an edge, in spite of the fact it has only 100 odd pages. Reading-wise, this book is definitely easier, because there are plenty of white spaces between paragraphs as well as sentences.<br /><br />To sum up my review, I rate this book a 3.	2005-09-05

Somehow, I managed to lay my hands on this little book which was originally written/published in the mid-60s. My copy is dated late 70s. The sub-title (How to shine in exams & life!)intrigues me.<br /><br />It's (i.e. my copy) actually a 'Melvin Powers' publication, so you can imagine the typical paper quality & text print that normally comes with it.<br /><br />From the start, I knew it would be a challenging task for me to read this book.<br /><br />Content-wise, I must admit the stuff inside is good. The whole gamut of strategies for test/exam preparation & test/exam taking, is appropriately covered. There is a brisk treatment of general study skills e.g. note-taking, building concentration. The only problem is that you have to literally use a magnifying glass to search for them, admist the small print & unattractive page layout.<br /><br />One more adverse comment: The story telling approach by the author from the beginning chapter is really boring!<br /><br />Here are the chapters in this rather hard-to-read book:<br /><br />- Open Sesame to Exams;<br />- Passing School Leaving Exams;<br />- Shining in Higher Education;<br />- The Essay in the English Paper;<br />- The Essay in Exams;<br />- A Hobby that helps (e.g. publish your article);<br />- A Year before the Exams;<br />- Long Term Planning;<br />- Notes on Notes;<br />- A Marvellous Memory;<br />- Cast Iron Concentration;<br />- The Night before the Exams;<br />- The Big Day;<br />- Treasure House (a colection of some 50 maxims);<br /><br />The book is targetted at teen students, although most of the strategies are applicable for those at higher education.<br /><br />Overall, from the standpoint of reading difficulty, I rate it a 3, although it deserves a 4, content-wise!	2005-09-05

I would rank this book in the same genre of books that include `Million Dollar Habits' (by Robert Ringer), `Seven Habits for Highly Effective People' (by Stephen Covey),  `Mastering the Rockefeller Habits' (by Verne Harnish) & `Developing the 21st Century Mind', by Marsha Sinetar.<br /><br />In the case of this book, the author has added fun practices, discovery exercises & many inspiring stories (as well as abundant `success' quotations, which help to fill up text space) to maximize & leverage on your innate habitual traits, as follows:<br /><br />- Awareness;<br />- Curiosity;<br />- Focus;<br />- Initiative;<br /><br />These are nothing new or exciting, if readers have been pursuing & exploring self-mastery principles.<br /><br />According to the author, all these four habitual traits, when developed further & honed properly, can be the catalysts for achieving our personal best. The secret is in consistently applying these four `habits of mind.\\"<br /><br />To each key trait, content-wise, the author devotes from two to four solid chapters. They are consistently well-treated. I really marvel at the author's narrative ability, by being able to explain, describe & illustrate in both scope & depth, just on these four habits. He certainly knows how to profit from his personal knowledge & field experiences as an executive advisor & success coach.<br /><br />At the end of each chapter, the author offers many useful strategies in developing & enhancing the habits as well as dealing with personal barriers.  I particularly like the author's attitude towards barriers: \\"Barriers provide us with important information about who we are & how we function under challenging conditions. Every time we confront a barrier, we improve our problem solving skills.\\"<br /><br />From my personal perspective, I definitely enjoyed perusing  - as well as playing with the exercises - chapters 7 to 10, on the Curiosity habit.<br /><br />The author's writing is also crisp & succinct, almost in a friendly conversational style.<br /><br />The author also invites the reader to take a live \\"Personal Brilliance Quotient Assessment\\" on his website. There are twenty assessment questions. My own score is 84, & am now classified as a Prospector. An explorer, to be exact, just  as I have expected, as the questions are too simplistic.<br /><br />Upon completion of the assessment, the author leads me subtly to `procure' more stuff from the website.  Frankly, the author's website is still incomplete. There are still many areas under construction. To me, this is almost like selling vapour-ware! Undoubtedly, a smooth operator, with a slick marketing move!<br /><br />Overall, it is still a worthwhile book to read.

For all intents & purposes, this book meets the requirements of a good study skill book for teens. The various topics covered are relevant & the eight chapters are organized, as follows:<br /><br />1. Introduction<br />2. Active Learning<br />3. The Writing Process<br />4. Introducing PREPsteps<br />5. Taking & Making Notes<br />6. Time Management<br />7. Test Taking Strategy<br />8. Goal Setting<br /><br />However, I am intrigued by the authors' arrangement of the chapters, particularly Chapter 6 & Chapter 8 pertaining to time management & goal setting respectively.<br /><br />In any kind of endeavours, goals & priorities must always take precedence. In the case of learning & studying for the student, goal setting & priority (as opposed to time) management must come first.<br /><br />Goals set the purpose & direction in life, & priorities set everything (i.e. all the tasks toward goal achievement) in motion. Without setting goals & managing priorities, everything one does become random activities.<br /><br />For example, in the introductory Chapter 1, the authors write in the first paragraph, \\"All kids - & that includes you - can become smart learners. But you won't get there by wishing....\\" If `goals setting & priority management' has been set as the introductory chapters, the contents of this particular chapter would make more sense for the teen reader, because smart learners are always goal-oriented!<br /><br />Again in Chapter 2: Active Reading & Chapter 3: The Writing Process, one very important element is missing. Active readers/writers always set a purpose (or goal) for reading/writing. With a purpose or goal in mind, the brain can search for/produce important information relevant to the purpose or goal during the reading/writing process. In fact, goal setting is paramount in setting all the four communication skills in motion: reading the textbooks, listening in class, speaking during discussions, & writing essays or reports.<br /><br />With a focus on goals (or the end in mind) & priorities (or first things first), (to paraphrase Sean Covey's & his 'Seven Habits for Highly Effective Teens'), Chapter 4: PREPsteps would become much more meaningful for the teen reader.<br /><br />Therefore, it would have been more appropriate for the authors to set Chapter 8 (goals) and Chapter 6 (priorities) as lead chapters accordingly in the book.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the authors give good instructions as well as appropriate examples for the above chapters.<br /><br />In Chapter 5: Taking & Making Notes, the authors outline three note-taking/making  methods. The first one, which the authors call it the `i' note method, using the symbolic alphabet `i' as a platform. Correspondingly, on a sheet of note-paper, the top half of the dot denotes an area for `topic' & the bottom half denotes an area for `main idea', & the stem denotes an area for `details'. `Summary' is located below the stem, with `vocabulary (new words or terms) as well as study questions are to be arranged on the left side of `i'. This is a refreshing approach to note-taking/making, which I have not come across before. Kudos to the authors!<br /><br />The second method, which the authors call `mapping', & judging by their description & instructions, is actually mind-mapping, a technique created by Tony Buzan. I don't quite understand why the authors don't call an apple `an apple' & also why they don't have the professional courtesy to credit Tony Buzan.<br /><br />The third method, which the authors call `Split-Summary-System' (or Triple S), is actually a replica of the famous Cornell Method, believed to have been developed by Prof. Walter Pauk of Cornell University. Again, the authors did not call an apple `an apple' & also did not credit Prof Walter Pauk.<br /><br />In most instances, I firmly believe that authors, whether they are experts or otherwise, often ride on the shoulders of giants. They should therefore always acknowledge where credit is due.<br /><br />Even in Chapter 4: PREPsteps, the steps & instructions given by the author, are actually a deliberate variation of the famous SQ3R Method, originally developed by a psychologist/teacher from Ohio State University, Francis Robinson, in the 1940s.  I know most authors want to coin something they can claim to be their proprietary methods, but they should not refrain from giving some due credit to the early pioneers.<br /><br />The lack of a bibliography at the end of the book says something about the authors' unwillingness to credit other authors.<br /><br />I note that `Memory Management' is not considered as a topical chapter, but the authors put a lot of emphasis on the subject of  organizing information at three levels for fast recall & the formulation of different type of questions, especially higher-order,  to aid fast recall.  These are reflected in the authors' detailed treatment of these aspects in the various chapters, particularly Chapter 2, 4 (The Process of Gathering, Recording, Organising, Retrieving & Using Information)) & 5. Kudos to the authors!<br /><br />I also note that `Lesson Revision/Rehearsal' should have been one topical chapter in this book. This is a very important topic for students. It plays a very vital role in academic success. The lack of this in study planning often results in cramming when the test/exam is near.  This leads to unnecessary test/exam anxiety buildup. In the case of this book, this aspect is only perfunctorily covered by the author in `Homework' under Chapter 7.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, a topical chapter on Stress Management would have completed this book very well for teens.<br /><br />In the last chapter, which should have been the preceding chapter, I concur with the authors' view that goal setting goes hand in hand with decision making. They recommend the simple PRACTAS decision making method, with a working example.<br /><br />On the whole, despite the shortcomings as I have just illustrated in the foregoing, I rate it a score of 4 (although I am inclined to rate it 3.5) for this book.<br /><br />For the teen reader, it is still a good study skill book.

They recommend the simple PRACTAS decision making method, with a working example.    On the whole, despite the shortcomings as I have just illustrated in the foregoing, I rate it a score of 4 (although I am inclined to rate it 3.5) for this book.    For the teen reader, it is still a good study skill book. There are many useful checklists e.g. Study SkillsQuestionnaire, & working examples in the book, in spite of the fact that this book has only about 100 odd pages.	2005-09-04

This book is actually part of a ten-book series on 'achieving high performance' for young adults. They come under Learning-a-Living Library, which comprises core subjects of, among others, understanding systems, self-management, leadership & organising information. These focused areas are very useful for todays' young adults to learn, develop & adopt as part of their lifestyles.<br /><br />Despite its compact size, only 64 pages, this book gives a good grounding to the subject of scheduling i.e. using time to your best advantage, as follows:<br /><br />- scheduling at school;<br /><br />- scheduling at work;<br /><br />- scheduling & your career;<br /><br />- scheduling & your future;<br /><br />The young adult examples used are also very appropriate.<br /><br />Unfortunately, like all the other books in the series, the publisher has done a lousy job in picking photographs, mostly black & white, for illustrations in the book. Even the colour photograph on the front cover is visually unappealing. In today's multimedia savvy world, I just wonder how young readers can be quickly attracted by this good book. This is my only complaint about this book.<br /><br />I like the 'Questions to Ask Yourself' at the end of each chapter. They help the reader to focus on key points & then ponder, prior to personal application.<br /><br />The resource bibliography at the end of the book is quite useful for young readers to pursue further on the subject.<br /><br />On the whole, I rate a score of 4 for this book.<br /><br />I would recommend young readers to also peruse the following titles in the series:<br /><br />- High Performance through Understanding Systems;<br /><br />- High Perrformance through Self Management;<br /><br />- High Performance through Leadership;<br /><br />- High Performance through Organising Information;	2005-09-02

This book is targetted primarily at young adults. It provides an excellent introduction to the concept of self management, which is a very important skill to acquire for peak performance & success in school, in work activities & ultimately, in life.<br /><br />Self  management, as the book explains, involves the following steps:<br /><br />- taking personal responsibility for all your choices, decisions & actions,;<br />- setting goals in all areas of your life;<br />- prioritising & scheduling all your activites;<br />- checking, monitoring & evaluating your progress toward goal achievment;<br /><br />There are only 64 pages in this book. Hence you can read it very quickly. However, at the end of each chapter (there are seven) the author has systematically posed the reader with some review/reflection questions. These questions have been crafted for the reader to think through the steps prior to personal application. I always enjoy reading books with questions like these.<br /><br />My only complaint about this book is that the photographs used in this book, some of which are in black & white, are very dull indeed. Even the colour photograph on the front cover is visually disappointing. In today's internet age, the publisher could have done a much better job here.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the author has provided a useful resource bibliography at the end of the book. They are worth further reading &/or exploration by the reader. In this context, I would like to add that this book is actually part of a 10-book-The Learning-a-Living Library series. Among the many titles, I particularly enjoy reading & exploring the following: (which I may review separately):<br /><br />- High Performance through Understanding Systems;<br />- High Performance through Leadership;<br />- High Performance through Effective Scheduling;<br />- High Performance through Organising Information;	2005-08-30

This is the author's first pioneering book, which he wrote after leaving the teaching world to embark on a career as a strategy consultant/process futurist in the early 80's. This was also one of the very first few books that propelled me into the world of strategic exploration.<br /><br />Drawing essentially from the scholarly work of Thomas Kuhn, who wrote the classic, The Theory of Scientific Revolutions, in the 70's, this author has very artfully expounded the concept of paradigm shift & pliancy in the world of business, in contrast to the world of science. From a strategic exploration viewpoint, this is an excellent guide book.<br /><br />Understanding and mastering your paradigms is one important thing for making progress in life and in business, but I personaly feel that the real essence of this book is succinctly captured by the author in the five  strategic exploration tools outlined in the book. They are the real gems of  the book. [Bear in mind that the author is a process futurist, unlike most other futurists who write books & who are primarily content futurists. The five specific tools mentioned in the book are the exact process tools to aid & enhance your strategic exploration. Do not get carried away by the content part of the book pertaining to some perceived trends illustrated by the author.]<br /><br />In addition, the author defines the concept of paradigm very well & also elaborates at length on its key characteristics & effects, with illuminating examples, as well as enlightening comparison/contrast of paradigm pliancy vs> paradigm paralysis.<br /><br />He highlights the importance of paradigm shift, pliancy & anticipation. I particularly enjoyed exploring the two specific thought-provoking questions posed by the author:<br /><br />(1) What do I believe is impossible to do in my field, but, if it could be done, would fundamentally change my business?<br /><br />(2) Who, outside my field, might be interested in my unsolved problems?<br /><br />By thinking about & answering these two challenging questions on your own, & against your own background, you will begin to understand the essence of the author's proposition. This will be the beginning of your own paradigm shift, as it has happened in my own life design for the second half.<br /><br />I would recommend readers to buy and read this book jointly with  Wayne Burkan's Wide-Angle Vision. Wayne Burkan has been a collaborator of  Joel Barker, and he introduces some more new ideas to the paradigm  phenomenon.<br /><br />Better still, view also and learn more from the videos (in  which both authors are the lead facilitators), The Paradigm Prism and The  Implications Wheel, which bring the whole paradigm concept to life and  which showcase some more real-world business examples.<br /><br />If you want to  explore your future, read this book!

I have perused all of them & have, in fact, made use of most of his strategies in capturing ideas & visualising concepts on paper (or on my computer, using the SmartDraw software).<br /><br />I am quite disappointed with this book because it is not a toolkit per se as claimed, but just a ragtag collection of the author's fancy drawings & zany sketches.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this book is that the author has systemically organised all his drawings & sketches into some appropriate categories (for quick reference). I must add, in fairness, that author has indeed put in some good efforts to illustrate in step by step fashion how he has created some of those stuff in the book. This approach, in a sense, gives readers, especially beginners, a wide range of possibilities to play & explore with the Rapid Visualisation process.<br /><br />If you have perused all his earlier books, like Draw, Design Yourself, Rapid Viz, then I would suggest you stay away from this book. In other words, you don't have to buy this book.<br /><br />However, if you just want to add this new book to your private collection, as I have actually done so, then, it is your personal choice.<br /><br />If you have not read any of the author's earlier books & you want to know about rapid visualisation, please get hold of his Rapid Viz book.

This book is essentially a simplified version of the author's earlier scholarly work, The Art of the Question, (under her maiden name), which is primarily written from a psycho-therapeutic perspective. The latter book expounds all the core concepts found in the new book. In this respect, there isn't anything new or exciting to offer. If you have already read the author's earlier book, then you don't have to waste money in getting this book.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for a much broader perspective & also deeper & systematic treatment on the art & discipline of questioning, I reckon the following books will give readers more value for money:<br /><br />for the business professional:<br />- Smart Questions, by Gerald Nadler;<br />- Asking Just Right Business Questions (especially, if you are planning to start your own business);<br />- Key Management Questions, by Tom Lambert (if you want to improve your managerial analysis);<br />- 78 Important Questions Every Leader Should Ask & Answer, by Chris Clarke-Epstein (if you want to sharpen your managerial skills);<br />- Leading with Questions, by Michael Marquardt (if you want to refine your strategic leadership skills);<br /><br />for the layman as well as business professional:<br />- Questions that Work, Andrew Finlayson;<br />- Dorothy Leeds' Smart Questions is also worth exploring;<br /><br />for those working in the academic arena, please get hold of Jamie McKenzie's books on the Questioning Technology (as the author calls it); a series of educational instruction books by Nancy Johnson (e.g. Questioning Makes the Difference) is worth exploring too!<br /><br />In fairness to the author, & if you are basically a beginner, the current book still gives quite an excellent & yet simple introduction to the subject. However, readers will have to contend with her storytelling approach, which I find somewhat taxing & boring. The author's unique model, 'QuestionThinking',  encompassing seven simple exploration tools, & her 'Top Twelve Questions for Change,' on the other hand, are still worth exploring.<br /><br />On the whole, it is relatively good work by the author, but there are other much better books as I have illustrated above.still worth exploring.

It is primarily targetted at organisational professionals sitting on the board - \\"direction givers\\" as the author calls them. It has since become one of my favourite strategic thinking books.<br /><br />In essence, it is a very well-organised collection of articles/essays written by a ragtag list of renowned practising experts (including Henry Mintzberg, Jerry Rhodes, Phil Hanford) in the field of strategic thinking & strategy consulting. The Editor is Bob Garratt, who runs a global strategy consultancy.<br /><br />Out of the many chapters, I enjoyed reading chapter 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 14. From a strategy formulation standpoints, the specific articles (chapters) are superb stuff with immediate application pliancy.<br /><br />Chapter 2 explains why it is imperative for board-level professionals to embrace strategic thinking.<br /><br />Chapter 5 is a real gem. It illustrates strategic thinking as visioning (or seeing) from multiple perspectives. A masterpiece by Henry Minzberg.<br /><br />Chapter 6 covers mindsets - the stumbling blocks to strategic thinking. Very well written/presented by the author.<br /><br />Chapter 7 is also a real gem. It introduces one enlightening perspective on strategic thinking processes. Although it gives a relatively broad brush, readers are recommended to pursue the contributing author (Jerry Rhodes)'s other books on the subject (specifically, The Colours of Your Mind & Conceptual Toolmaking).<br /><br />Chapter 10 is an eye opener on exploring various strategic options, using a multitude of practical tools (as outlined in the resources)introduced by the author. The author is the late Phil Hanford. For beginners & veterans, his one article/essay alone is worth more than the price of the book. My only 'complaint' is that Bob Garratt did not name the above contributing author's book on strategic management, where most of the concepts & technqiues mentioned in the article were originally developed. I could not trace the book at amazon.com.<br /><br />Chapter 14 introduces the ten steps to strategic thinking, among other interesting ideas for direction givers.<br /><br />To sum up my review, & if readers are looking for a quick short-cut to understanding strategic thinking from many different perspectives, as well as achieving a solid foundation on the subject (through further exploration, of course), this book is definitely a good starter. It is very succinctly & concisely written, with an all-encompassing introduction as the beginning chapter. Kudos to Bob Garratt!were originally developed. I could not trace the book at amazon.com.

Surprisingly, this book has been out in the market for more than a decade & yet I have not come across any reviews. This book is, in fact, one of the very first few pragmatic books that touched on the subject of mindsets & what to do about them.<br /><br />I have read it, in fact many times, in the early 90s when I first embarked on my relentless search for better understanding of peak performance in both personal & professional arenas.<br /><br />It is essentially a book about first understanding & then resetting your mindsets - & shifting your paradigms. The author (a British consultant) shares a gamut of practical strategies on how to work with & to reset them. Like cancer, mindsets, especially the dogmatic ones, if not removed &/or resetted, can kill you - to be more prescise, your personal as well as professional productivity!<br /><br />It is very well written, in crisp & concise language - quite a brilliant piece of work, - & packed with interesting ideas (especially the Ideas into Action & The Leading Edge chapters, with the author's proprietary AGISA Model) as well as excellent anecdotes. The author does not bombard you with fancy theories. He is very straight-forward. There are also many fun exercises (especially the perplexing optical illusions) to do, too.

I was attracted to this book firstly because of the authors' earlier book, The 2000 per cent Solution, in which they shared some very interesting insights about creative problem solving. Secondly, it has a primary focus on business innovation...business model innovation, to be more precise. Thirdly, while doing a quick browsing, I noted that at the onset, the authors have deliberately outlined the success sequence of the model in the introduction. From my personal experience, the latter often makes the reading assimilation like a breeze! Unfortunately, I noted that very few authors do this.<br />Again, I must say this book did not disappoint me after my perusal.  This book has really lived up to the authors' purpose of writing their book: ..to re-direct your PERCEPTION of what must be done to lead...to help shift your FOCUS into more productive directions....<br />I would have thought that a more appropriate secondary title for this book should have been `Secrets of Continually Developing a Disciplined Business Opportunity Sensitivity Model'.<br />It is exactly from this standpoint that I have enjoyed reading this book and have ranked it as an excellent guide.<br />In fact, on page 255, under Chapter 8, the authors have even quoted Edward de Bono: \\"Everyone is surrounded by opportunities. But they only exist once they have been seen. And they will only be seen if they are looked for.\\"<br />There is a very broad spectrum of business examples, and most of them are very well-illustrated. There are also numerous self-probing questions at the end of some chapters to help the reader to think through some critical issues. The questions are very discerning and disciplined: well-structured and yet open-ended. All these have been beautifully crafted to help the reader to develop direct observation skills - they resonates fully with de Bono's contention as illustrated above.<br />From my personal perspective, I would have expected the authors to give a more detailed and in-depth treatment of the closing chapters, particularly Chapters 7 and 8.  This would have been an added punch to the book. For example, I fancy the `Look at the Orchard as well as the Tree' section was somewhat perfunctorily treated. This would have given the reader a more systems-perspective of the business model innovation. This is my only adverse comment about this book.<br />On the whole, in terms of learning points and application orientation from the opportunity sensitivity standpoint,  I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Among the numerous examples, I particularly enjoyed reading the anecdotes about Peter Drucker and Frank Wright.<br />If you need help in identifying opportunity-sensitive areas in your business, I strongly recommend readers to get hold of this book - and if you desire to enhance your opportunity sensitivity capability further, I would strongly suggest you `syntopicalise' your reading with the following books:<br />Edward de Bono's Opportunities;<br />Peter Drucker's Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship;<br />Michel Robert's Innovation Formula;<br />Peter Skat-Rordam's Changing Strategic Direction;<br />Art Turock's Invent Business Opportunities;<br /><br />Enjoy your assimilation!pth treatment of the closing chapters, particularly Chapters 7 and 8.

It has already taken me some ten weeks to digest and complete almost all the suggested exercises, alternating between reading, hands-on computer activities, and off-screen sketching on paper, plus various cycles of deep reflection and intellectual pursuit on the net. As of today, I am still working on some of the suggested activities. In fact, many of the completed activities led me to a lot of other new explorations, beyond the originally intended curriculum. My only complaint is that the interactive CD-ROM was not as exciting as I would have expected. This was probably due to the fact that the product was released in the mid-90s. Among the many visual thinking toolkits in my personal library, this one demanded the most of my brain and physical power.

Actually, I was intrigued by the main title: Problems are the Solution. When I got hold of the book, and at first browse, I was a bit disappointed. It was a ragtag collection of articles, and the presentation layout was somewhat horrendous, probably due to the fact that it was self-published.<br />Of course, I knew at the onset that the book was primarily geared towards teaching professionals in an educational setting. After browsing through the table of contents, somehow my unconscious instincts drove me to peruse the book from cover to cover.<br />As usual, I read the book from the standpoint of a business professional. I was glad I did it.<br />I found Chapter 1: Snapshots of Information Literacy, Chapter 2: Developing a Learning Culture, Chapter 3: The Affective Dimension of Information Literacy, and Chapter 4: Transforming Scribes into Thinkers quite interesting. They gave me some fresh perspectives, with regard to developing understanding and insight from information glut to guide decisions, solve problems and navigate complexity in today's information economy. I reckon Chapter 4 would be useful in enlightening those business professionals who are doing evening MBAs.<br />I found Chapter 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 to be more relevant towards teaching professionals, especially if they want to gain more practical insights into problem-based learning in an educational setting. Chapter 10 shared some school examples.<br />I particularly enjoyed Chapter 8: Questioning Toolkit. This chapter blew my mind about the questioning process. I never knew one could have access to so many directions in posing questions, moving from the Essential Question (this provides the organizing focus)  right down to detailed, deeper and disparate questions (they help illuminate and build answers to the EQ.)<br />To satisfy curiosity, I append below the cluster of questions (different type of questions accomplish different tasks):<br />Telling Q<br />Sorting &amp; Sifting Q<br />Clarification Q<br />Organising Q<br />Probing Q<br />Hypothetical Q<br />Planning Q<br />Elaborating Q<br />Strategic Q<br />Inventive Q<br />Irrelevant Q<br />Divergent Q<br />Irreverent Q<br />Provocative Q<br />Unanswerable Q<br />Subsidiary Q<br />From my personal perspective as a knowledge adventurer, the value of this chapter was worth the price of the entire book. I even took the next step of ordering the book, Beyond Technology: Questioning, Research &amp; The Information Literacy School, by Jamie McKenzie who wrote the chapter 8. After reading it, I strongly recommend readers to get hold of both books, if you have a deep personal interest in understanding information literacy.<br />To sum up, the gist of both books is actually how to navigate through information glut, how to convert learning tasks into problem scenarios (in the form of probing questions) and how to adopt a critical approach in all our reading - to be more precise, information gathering -  tasks so as to create abundant opportunities for the development of original ideas and insights.

I have always been fascinated by all kinds of questioning processes, and have amassed a huge library of books in this arena. This is one of my favourites in terms of application possibilities. Questions serve as thinking prompts! Questions activate your answering reflex to problems (= opportunities)! Questions strengthen your focus! Questions expedite your navigation through information overload! In this respect, this book is very useful for business professionals - with a little bit of adaptation, of course - as I myself have used many of the approaches recommended by the author in the field of business and marketing. For teachers, this is an excellent manual/resource to help enhance classroom interaction with students, and eventually their own mental development as well as performance. It covers some twelve questioning processes in great depth as well as comprehensive breadth from the perspectives of gathering, sorting, organising and interpretation. It is also packed with many concrete examples and explicit directions. For the business professional, this book may at the very beginning be a little bit dry, and also needs some really creative juices to convert some of the stuff for application in the business world. Your effort, I must add, will be ambly rewarded. For the teaching professional I would strongly recommend the author's other book - Learning to Question, Questioning to Learn. The business professional is welcome to get hold of this book, too.	2003-02-04

I bought this book as part of my own relentless search for better understanding of effective reading processes for business professionals. It is designed primarily for the academic professional in an educational setting. The authors are academic researchers/lecturers.<br /><br />The writing style is therefore a little bit dry and somewhat boring, but I must add that it has some interesting ideas, especially Chapter 2 (The Skilled Adult Reader). It provides some useful perspectives about becoming a skilled reader. Chapters 5 and 6 were quite relevant, too, in my personal context of understanding the psychological processes of reading.<br /><br />I guess for teaching professionals, this book will definitely serve its intended purpose.<br /><br />For the general and business reader like me, it takes a lot of personal effort to digest the material. I only wish that the author had put in some schematic illustrations or diagramatic aids and/or more spaced textual layout to bring out the key learning points. That would have made the book much more palatable, especially for a visual learner like me.<br /><br />On this basis & on the whole, I rate it a 3.	2003-02-04

I have always been impressed by the work of the Kepner-Tregoe team because their methodologies really work.<br /><br />My first encounter with their work was the mastering - and application - of their Problem Solving & Decision Making (PSDM)strategies in the late 70's/early 80's, while I was a practising engineer. Subsequent fruitful encounters include reading - and assimilating - Tregoe's Vision at Work and Top Management Strategy (both of which are great works) when I was a General Manager.<br /><br />This book should have been available when I was still working in the corporate world. Anyway, I am very pleased to have bought and perused this wonderful book, which I will now add to my Strategic Thinking and Strategic Leadership bookshelf.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed digesting the authors' practical approach to strategy formulation, which has been extensively covered in the book. The attendant case studies - field-tested - have been well selected and the process of working out their integrated model to help readers to understand - and eventually apply - has also been well crafted.<br /><br />I also like their way of posing pertinent questions to think through some of the process steps.<br /><br />All practising managers must get hold of this book. In terms of depth and breadth in the strategic thinking process, as well as the clarity in writing and presentation, I would rate this book in the same genre as Michel Robert's strategic thinking books. Across the board, the authors' writing in the book is crisp and succinct, and I really appreciate authors who write this way.	2003-01-30

This is a small, little 'no-frills' book...more precisely, a booklet! My copy is actually a badly-stitched photostatic copy from the publisher. Fortunately, the contents of the book outweighed the book's poor aesthetics.<br />The 32 pages of the book are jam-packed with appropriate advice for anyone who wants to go into business for himself as fast as possible with the least risk, time and money.<br />In 9 easy steps, and the help of many thoughtful questions as a checklist, the author shows you how to spot and evaluate simple business opportunities, in addition to explaining to you the various types or configurations of business opportunities available in today's marketplace.<br />1: What are the available facts?<br />2: How to give it an acid test?<br />3: Who will buy the product or service?<br />4: Who are my competitors?<br />5: What and how do I need to invest?<br />6: How to avoid front loading?<br />7: What are the supports available?<br />8: Who are these people?<br />9: How are they financially?<br />In a nut shell, the whole system from the author is actually very simple and straight-forward.<br />Get a copy.

From my personal perspective, I think this book will serve as an useful reading companion to the other reading strategy books I have reviewed so far.<br />As the author contends, the primary objective of this book is to help you become an independent, strategic and effective learner in your college studies.<br />In a nutshell, her substantial content is arranged in three stages as follows:<br />Introduction:<br />- getting to know yourself;<br />- getting to know your textbooks;<br />- getting to know your instructors;<br />Empowerment:<br />- taking notes from college textbooks;<br />- identifying & learning new words;<br />- comprehending textual material;<br />- extracting key information;<br />- recoding key information;<br />- preparing for & taking college level test;<br />- beoming a critical readers;<br />Refinement (with study guides):<br />- sample chapter from Psychology;<br />- sample chapter from Biology;<br />- sample chapter from History;<br />- sample chapter from Music;<br />Although she has provided with a bank of powerful reading & study strategies for reading comprehension, vocabulary, note taking & test taking in the empowerment stage of the book, I feel she should have also provided more reading samples & study guides from the other disciplines in her refinement stage.<br />For beginners, I feel she has done a great job in her introduction stage by helping readers to get acquainted, at the onset, with themselves (Know Thyself, to paraphrase Socrates), their textbooks and even their instructors. This important stage can also serve as a goal setting & time management platform for students/readers.<br />For readers who want to learn how to do marginal notations or annotations in their textbooks, the author provides many excellent hands-on examples. In terms of information gathering from textbooks, this is a very important skill for college students to acquire.<br />The author's creative concepts of using FLIP and SCORE approaches in the reading processes are interesting, as opposed to the traditional SQ3R method...even though they share many similarities.<br />On the whole, I have enjoyed reading - and learning from this book. To sum up, this book can serve as a useful reading companion to:<br />Adam Robinson's What Smart Students Know;<br />Anne Dye Phillips/Peter Sotiriou's Steps to Reading Proficiency;<br />Eleanor Leo's Powerful Reading Efficient Reading;<br />Kathleen McWhorter's Academic Reading;<br />Dave Ellis' Becoming a Master Student;opposed to the traditional SQ3R method...even though they share many similarities.<br />On the whole, I have enjoyed reading - and learning from this book.

Among the many books I have acquired on effective study strategies over the years, this one book is the simplest and easiest to read. It gives direct-to-the-point instructions in:<br />- notetaking;<br />- listening;<br />- time management;<br />- memory techniques;<br />- test preparation;<br />- reading &amp; studying;<br />So, if you are a beginner into study strategies, and you want a quick one, grab hold of this book!<br />The author's writing style is crisp, uncluttered and clear. It has some interesting margin graphics, to ease your reading, especially if you are a visual reader.<br />At the end of the book, the author provides a simple yet handy chart to help you organise your new skills into an effective personal study strategy.<br />If you are looking for a substantially 'heavier' (in scholarlistic terms) book on study strategies, go for James Semones' 'Effective Study Skills'. I must warn you though, as it is somewhat 'heavy' stuff. For an 'in-between book', I would recommend Judy Roberts' Effective Study Skills.	2002-03-25

I have a burning fascination for books on effective study strategies. I am always searching for better and more effective strategies to help kids and teens to excell in their school life...also, to help professional adults navigate text information overload as part of their evening academic pursuits.<br />Judy Roberts's Effective Study Skills is one of these books I have acquired as part of my lifelong search. It is comprehensive...also presents a broad range of study strategies, with quite extensive coverage of reading skills needed to process college textbooks...but still not the best.<br />However, looking from the standpoint of a beginner in acquiring study strategies, I reckon this book can still serve as a useful strategy guide.<br />For beginners, the layout of the book's substantial content runs as follows:<br />- Time Management;<br />- Concentration & Memory;<br />- Learning Styles;<br />- Critical Reading & Thinking;<br />- Gathering Main Ideas;<br />- Reading Graphic Illustrations;<br />- Understanding Organisational Patterns;<br />- Adopting Vocabulary Acquisition Strategies;<br />- Study Methods for Textbooks;<br />- Notetaking, Annotating & Underlining;<br />- Writing in College;<br />- Test Taking Skills;<br />The main reason why I rate it as 'not the best' is because I am comparing it with James Semones's 'Effective Study Skills'. Although the latter book is somewhat long-winded to some extent, I strongly feel it has a much broader scope and also farther depth than Judy Roberts' book. It is also written in a scholarly - albeit serious - manner, very unlike Roberts' book, which is written in an informal and conversational style.<br />For beginner readers into study strategies - and those who simply don't like long-winded books -, George Usova's 'Efficient Study Strategies' is worth exploring! It gives direct-to-the-point instructions...and also the easiest to read, especially for beginners!	2002-03-25

I particularly like her creative concept of learning word parts to generate the multiplier effect.<br />Like any other reading techniques book, this book also has plenty of reading assignments and practical exercises across the disciplines.<br />When compared to Shirley Quinn's 'Active Reading in the Arts &amp; Sciences', which also covered disciplne-specific reading skills, and which I had also reviewed, this book definitely has a much broader scope and also a much farther depth.<br />Strategy-wise, I would add that this book is an excellent reading companion to Eleanor Leo's 'Powerful Reading, Efficient Learning' and Anne Phillips/Peter Sotiriou's 'Steps to Reading Proficiency', which I had reviewed earlier.

This excellent book is among my personal collection of selected books written by Jeffry Timmons, who is internationally renowned and respected in the field of entrepreneurship education and research. It follows Timmons' earlier book, The Entrepreneurial Mind, which I had already reviewed. In some way, it is linked to also Timmons' earlier (now revised/expanded for the 21st Century) pioneering book, New Venture Creation.<br />What I like about this book is that it helps you to understand the critical difference between 'idea' and 'opportunity', and also how to evaluate each and pursue them. It has a focus on execution as opposed to just having ideas.<br />For an entrepreneur wannabe, a clear understanding of the distinctions between an 'idea' and an 'opportunity' can make or break the business or project success. As the saying goes, Clarity is Power!<br />In a nutshell, it helps you to answer many crucial questions at the onset, prior to embarking on your venture, for example:<br />- what is a good opportunity?<br />- why do a selected few opportunities inherently have much greater upside potential than all the rest?<br />- why and how do winning entrepreneurs often find the best opportunities?<br />- how can you find such opportunities? or create one?<br />- would you recognise an opportunity when you see it?<br />- how can you determine whether the opportunity will last?<br />- is it the right opportunity for you?<br />- can you determine to what extent it will add or create value, and thereby actually fill a customer need?<br />All the chapters in the book are well organised and systematically structured for easy follow-up reading.<br />The core chapters, which I find very useful, are as follows:<br />Chapter 1: what is an idea?<br />Chapter 2: enhancing creativity (tickles your brain!);<br />Chapter 3: sources of new business ideas:<br />Chapter 4: recognising opportunities (wow!);<br />Chapter 5: sources for opportunity screening (wow!);<br />Chapter 7: opportunity screening guide ( a real gem!);<br />Chapter 8: using other peoples resources or OPR (very interesting insight!);<br />The opportunity screening guide illustrated in the book is a real gem. It can really help you to determine whether you want to continue your initial pursuit and develop a complete business plan.<br />The remaining chapters, chapter 13, 14, 15 16 and 17 show how the three essentials of venture creation: opportunities, people and resources come together to face the many difficulties, which arise for entrepreneurs. With these enlightening chapters covering entrepreneurs in action, this book is deeply rooted in real-world applications plus 20 years of classroom refinement by the author as an entrepreneurship educator/academic.<br />Best of all and on the whole, the book is very easy to read and follow.

Starting and launching a new business or project venture is always risky, especially when experts are not around to guide and assist you readily.<br />Oftentimes, we turn to books and other resources that are readily available to help in our decision making process.<br />There are many entrepreneurship and business/project start-up books out there in the marketplace. Unfortunately, it is not easy to find a good one that can really help you. Very few authors of such books make the effort and spend the time to help you reflect on your idea(s) and test it/them before putting into action.<br />I am very glad to have found, among other few good books, David Bang's 'Smart Steps to Smart Choices,' to be a well-written guide. Also, very user-friendly!<br />Most entrepreneurship and business/project startup books concentrate too much time on the 'implementation-execution' end, and not at the 'thinking-planning' end i.e. the evaluation & testing phase, which comprises the critical decision making process, and which to me is far more important.<br />This book contains a well-structured series of 'personal workshops' (to me, these are an excellent form of planning checklists, with thought-provoking questions & hands-on activities) which have been designed specifically to help you develop practial insights about your business/project idea & also help you face and work out your answers to critical issues that may make or break your business/project success. Systematically, with this book, you can determine:<br />- whether entreprenership is right for you in the first place;<br />- whether your idea makes business sense;<br />- whether your idea makes market sense;<br />- whether your idea makes money sense;<br />This is one book that you have to work through it to appreciate its latent power and usable value. With this book, you will also find learning about entreprenership fun, interesting and meaningful.<br />As a matter of fact, I use a small pilot project of mine to test run it. Upon completion, I found that I have a better sense of my project direction, in terms of business, market and financial implications. Not many books can achieve such feats for the reader.<br />What I also like about this book is that it is graphically driven. It is packed with many margin icons to help you stay on track while you read and work through your answers. I love books written in this manner. They really make your life easier as a reader.<br />Although the author has written many other books on business and market planning, I find only this one book from him that has impressed me very much, in terms of learning points and application value in the field of opportunity recognition and evaluation.<br />Lastly, this book can also serve as an excellent reading companion to Jeffry Timmons' and Karl Vesper's books on entrepreneurship & new venture strategies!pon completion, I found that I have a better sense of my project direction, in terms of business, market and financial implications.

When I embarked on my private research into entrepreneurship education, as part of the design & development of an entrepreneurship program for kids, I narrowed down my personal selection of books written by excellent authors/academics. At the same time, I also wanted to learn from the personal - and professional - learning experiences of entrepreneurs, who had gone through the venture jungle, and widen my working knowledge, particularly on the subject of opportunity recognition.<br />One author/academic I have selected is Jeffry Timmons, who wrote, among other excellent books, The Entrepreneurial Mind. I had already reviewed this title.<br />The other author/academic I have selected is Karl Vesper. I have bought & also read practically all the books that have been written by him.  I must add that I am very impressed by the work of this author.<br />From time to time, I will share with readers all my hand-picked authors/academics as I write my other reviews.<br />This is one of Vesper's earlier books. I am very glad to have bought & read it. The main topics include:<br />- perspectives on entrepreneurship;<br />- success & failure factors;<br />- career departure points;<br />- sequences in shartup;<br />- sources of venture ideas;<br />- evaluating venture ideas;<br />- main competitive entry wedges;<br />- other entry wedges;<br />- acquisition finding;<br />- acquisition dealing;<br />In esssence, this book stresses the cultivation of learnable skills in the foregoing areas that can raise the odds of venturing successfully.<br />When compared with Timmons, Vesper's books are more scholarly in content approach. So, Vesper's books are often a bit heavy going.<br />In this book, there are a lot of real-world examples of how entrepreneurs enter the venture jungle, how they select their ventures,  how they explore lines of action, and how they build their businesses. The book explores the various strategies of these entrepreneurs, from both personal as well as commercial perspectives.<br />I particularly enjoyed chapter 2, which touches on the success & failure factors (wannabes, please pay attention here!); chapter 3, on career departure points; chapter 4, on sequences in startup (this is a real gem to read!); chapter 5, on sources of venture ideas (another gem!); chapter 6, on evaluating venture ideas (another gem!). From the commercial persepctive, the remaining chapters provide many interesting insights.<br />In terms of writing style, I am more comfortable with Timmons' books, but I am not saying Vesper does not write well.<br />At the end of each chapter, there is a summary. I like books written in this way. It makes reading & review easy & fast.<br />For entrepreneur wannabes, this is a superbly researched book for your learning pursuit!br />I particularly enjoyed chapter 2, which touches on the success & failure factors (wannabes, please pay attention here!); chapter 3, on career departure points; chapter 4, on sequences in startup (this is a real gem to read!); chapter 5, on sources of venture ideas (another gem!); chapter 6, on evaluating venture ideas (another gem!).

Getting an idea or ideas out of your head is often not a difficult task. Most people can do it easily and fast too, even if they are put under time pressure. Sometimes, under time pressures, surprisingly many people can even come up with whacky and yet brilliant ideas.<br />However, idea generation or creativity for that matter, is only a small part of the whole equation. There is no dispute ideas come from individual minds, but innovation will only take place when you are able to promote or sell your idea or ideas to your or other people. It takes teams or a group of interested people to make your ideas to work i.e to make innovation to happen.<br />There are a lot of idea generation and/or creativity books out in the markeptplace, but very hard to find books touching on the promotion and selling of ideas. From my personal pursuit over the years, I have found only a small handful of good books in this genre.<br />I am very glad to have found this one book. The four authors are well qualified, as all of them are business communication professionals.<br />As the authors contend: \\"There are three phases in getting an idea off the ground:<br />1. Get an idea...and sell it!<br />2. Develop the idea..and sell it!<br />3. Move the idea to market...and really sell it!\\"<br />This book describes, in a step-by-step process, the strategic and tactical elements of the promotion and selling proposition, as follows:<br />- research your ideas from all standpoints;<br />- develop a compehensive plan;<br />- build a support network;<br />- develop a winning presentation;<br />- prepare to present;<br />- deliver your winning case;<br />- celebrate;<br />I am very impressed by this book partly because the authors took a comprehensive, broad-based approach to the subject at hand. They wrote it in the context of both organisational and personal perspectives. In the process, the authors covered every conceivable angle of promoting and selling your idea or ideas - from understanding your organisation, educating yourself right through building your case, gaining allies, assessing your audience, and all the way to designing and preparing your case and presenting your information/ideas.<br />The chapter pertaining to 'Building a Business Case' is a gem to read and follow. This is a very important area to note in promoting and selling your idea. Oftentimes, people get carried away by their whacky ideas and they forget that the numbers or bottom-line are also important considerations, especially when you want to get support.

In the course of designing and developing an entrepreneurship program for kids, and also expanding further my working knowledge on opportunity creation, I surfed through several online bookstores, including www.amazon.com to scout and pursue good books on entrepreneurship and new venture creation. I perused practically every book review in this genre, and I managed to narrow down my selections to a handful of highly respected authors. Jeffry Timmons is one of them, and I bought practically all the books that have been written by him.<br />In the case of Jeffrey Timmons, who is internationally renowned for his pioneering research work in new ventures, venture capital, venture financing and entrepreneurship, he is also a well respected academic.<br />This is my first entrepreneurship book by the author.<br />This book addresses what makes winning entrepreneurs strategise -think, plan and act - in the marketplace. Although it was written in the late 1980s, it still offers a tremendous wealth of information. It also addresses what they do and avoid doing to get the odds of success in their favour. It also focuses on the founders of new ventures as well as entrepreneurial managers, and provides many interesting answers that help to unlock the mystery - and mythology - of entrepreneurship.<br />Stretched over 187 pages, this book is really an insightful study of entrepreneurs, be they budding or mature, particularly from the standpoint of opportunity/new venture creation.<br />I rate this book with only four stars because when I compare it with Rita Gunther McGrath & Ian MacMillan's 'The Entrepreneurial Mindset,' the latter enjoys a much greater edge, in terms of the depth and breadth of coverage. The latter is quite a scholarly work and is also stretched over 380 pages.<br />In some way, because of its size, I feel this book can be excellent preamble to 'The Entrepreneurial Mindset.' If you seriously want to know how winning entrepreneurs strategise, read both books - and start with this one first!d start with this one first!	2002-03-06

Also, I was attracted to the book because of an introduction by Robert Kiyosaki, whose work I am very familiar.<br />Although the book gives a broad brush about intellectual property (IP) protection from many different perspectives, and offers some useful guidelines to help protect your intellectual interests, it is somewhat incomplete as far as the protection of ideas or intellectual capital is concerned.<br />It does not give any specific illustration and/or example on how to protect your intellectual capital from the standpoint of goodwill, reputation, expertise, (especially accumulated practical skills), data and know-how...more specifically, your ideas and/or \\"working methodologies\\" which are embodied in products and services.<br />Take an example from the book, on page 58, under Utility Patent Protection, the author talked about:<br />\\"Business method is patentable if:<br />- it produces a useful, concrete, and tangible result; and<br />- it is novel and not obvious;<br />but the book stops short of giving specific business cases or product examples to illustrate this key point. This is, to me, intellectual capital, and I want to know how to protect it!<br />As a matter of fact, the author talked about how he came to know Robert Kiyosaki...from the CashFlow game. Funny enough, the author did not even bother to give any detailed account on the IP protection scheme pertaining to the game. Nothing at all, period. I thought this would have been a very appropriate subject, because of the need for the protection of intellectual capital behind the development of the game - and the gameplay procedure - from pirates.<br />The book listed a lot of other IP stuff, which were not covered in the book, but the author directed the reader to his website. For example, the author introduced his IP self-audit checklist, among other things, which sounds interesting. When I checked his website, I realised I had to fork out US$129/- to buy a CD-ROM containing the stuff.<br />My overall personal impression of the book is that both Michael Lechter and Robert Kiyosaki are using each other to sell each other's products and services! (which are well-illustrated on many end pages of the book!) The poor reader is expected to fork out more effort and money...maybe that's why the Rich Dad series of products are so lucrative for the author.<br />On the whole, this book falls short of my personal expectations. I am very disappointed with the author and also, Robert Kiyosaki.<br />To be fair to the author, I feel that the book, even though it is incomplete from my personal viewpoint, still provides a broad-brush about IP, - especially on copyrights, patents,and trademarks, -  from many different perspectives.t, among other things, which sounds interesting.

Reading has been...and will always be...my passion, and I read voraciously. Hence, I always scout for and pursue high-performance reading techniques. It is now my lifelong learning pursuit. I approach them with an open mind as my primary focus is on what works for me, with playing, exploring and experimenting as my evaluation tools.<br />This is one book, I must say, contains the best and most comprehensive collection of text organisational (writing) patterns I have seen so far. In a nut shell, understanding and mastering text organisational (writing) patterns at the onset after your initial preview allow you to navigate the given text at very high speeds.<br />In total, this book introduces eleven (11) patterns:<br />- enumeration pattern (listing);<br />- time sequence;<br />- example pattern;<br />- cause & effect pattern;<br />- problem & solution pattern;<br />- compare & contrast pattern;<br />- spatial pattern;<br />- definition pattern;<br />- process pattern;<br />- classification pattern;<br />- description pattern;<br />In any kind of reading, a quick preview is imperative. This book also introduces you to a variety of preview techniques, just like any other reading technique books.<br />Understanding the text organisational (writing) patterns makes your preview much more efficient and effective.<br />All information has shape. Just take a close look at the word INFORMATION. The root word is FORM. So, if you want to read fast, you must learn to shape or form your understanding quickly. If you can see this FORM at the onset, it becomes much more easier for you to understand how the information in the given text is organised. With this understanding, it become easier and also faster for you to pick out the key ideas or details.<br />The author has done an excellent job in illustrating all the eleven text organisation (writing) patterns. There are also a lot of reading exercises or practices for you to play, explore and experiment with the patterns. They are really worth the cover price for the book.<br />I teach kids and teens as well as adults how to read at very high speeds. In other words, I help them to survive...and thrive in...the information overload! From my own personal and professional experiences, the purpose of reading is to GATHER INFORMATION...IDEAS to be more precise. I always advise them ...using Pareto' Law...that 80% of the meaning of any given paragraph are often captured in only 20% of the words...these are the key ideas! (In fact, I have read from somewhere...an empirical study...that 4 to 11 % of any given text contains the key ideas!)<br />Knowing how to discern text organisational (writing) patterns in the first instance gives you the turbo boost to locate the key ideas very quickly and eventually navigate the reading texts at very high speeds.<br />If you combine these reading techniques with mindmapping or using graphic organisers and/or other visual tools, your ability to organise and synthesise ideas...and generating insights...from all your reading become very powerful.<br />So, if you want to be a masterful reader, just like me...this book is a must read!over price for the book.<br />I teach kids and teens as well as adults how to read at very high speeds.

When compared with 'Steps to Reading Proficiency', by Anne Phillips & Peter Sotiriou, the former has a greater edge. Nevertheless, this book is definitely still worth reading.<br />In terms of text organisational (writing) patterns, it has seven, namely:<br />- definition;<br />- exemplification;<br />- cause & effect;<br />- comparison & contrast;<br />- sequence;<br />- classification;<br />- division;<br />There are some slight variations to those illustrated by the former book in comparison.<br />Understanding these patterns can improve both your comprehension and your retention.<br />What I like about this book is that it introduces MAPPING (it can be mind-mapping or the use of graphic organisers & other visual tools e.g. clustering) as a PRE-READING as well as a POST-READING activity. These are very good reading strategies.<br />Mapping BEFORE YOUR READ gets you thinking about the topic, and more important, gets you thinking about what you already know about the topic. This helps you use what information you already have to your best advantage.<br />Mapping AFTER YOU READ helps you to process the information more deeply than you would if you did nothing to review the material. It helps you find relationships among ideas and terms; it helps you determine the organisation of the material, it forces you to pull it together in a way that makes learning more efficient for you.<br />Another interesting approach introduced in this book is the concept of synthesising ideas i.e. the pulling together pieces of information into overall ideas. This is often one of the most difficult skills for readers. The author addressed the skills you need to learn to synthesise information by using both PRE-READING and POST-READING MAPPING activities, in conjuction with the formulation of questions. On the issue of questions, the author also addressed it very well, with the formulation of questions BEFORE/DURING/AFTER reading. She gave an excellent hand-holding application example, and plenty of exercises to help you build this important skill.<br />Just like the other reading technique books, it has also excellent reading practices and assignments.<br />If you are looking for better and more ways to boost your reading performance, this book is still worth your time and effort.of exercises to help you build this important skill.<br />Just like the other reading technique books, it has also excellent reading practices and assignments.<br />If you are looking for better and more ways to boost your reading performance, this book is still worth your time and effort.	2002-03-03

It is also the most comprehensive &amp; yet indepth! It has assisted my professional work while I was working in the corporate world.<br />In a nut shell, this book has a very practical, well-structured &amp; clearly-defined numerical rating system, ranging from rough processing to full evaluation, to help you in your exploration &amp; evaluation, covering:<br />four (4) broad facets, namely:<br />- your product/service/activity (in terms of prospective performance, salability, defensibility);<br />- yourself or your company (in terms of personal traits &amp; relative strengths/weaknesses);<br />- your environment (in terms of possible effects);<br />- your venture (in terms of investment considerations &amp; strategic possibilities;<br />These are broken down into:<br />- thirteen (13) general aspects;<br />These are further broken down into:<br />- sixty nine (69) individual factors;<br />The authors coin the acronym 'SAVE' (hence the book title, Strategic Analysis Venture Evaluation) to sum up their wonderful model. The model approach will definitely save you from potential failure.<br />Packed with forms, checklists, questions, it will compel your careful attention to all the factors involved in a new venture, thus preventing dangerous blindspots. It also help to prevent over-valueing a few dominant factors that tend to distort decision/judgement.<br />As the authors contend in the inside cover of this book: &quot;This is the only book that provide you with immediate answers to such complex questions as, How attractive is this proposed venture, to this company, organisation or individual, at this time, and under this set of conditions.&quot;<br />I highly recommend this book to all project managers!authors contend in the inside cover of this book: &quot;This is the only book that provide you with immediate answers to such complex questions as, How attractive is this proposed venture, to this company, organisation or individual, at this time, and under this set of conditions.&quot;<br />I highly recommend this book to all project managers!	2002-03-01

Another indispensable opportunity management guide!	Following my personal review of the latest opportunity management book, Harnessing the Unicorn, by Pat O'Reilly, I came across this wonderful book, actually by accident, while surfing through the www.amazon.com website for other books in the same genre. Again, I was very happy to have obtained - and perused - the book.<br />This book is for any business professional who is involved in conceptualising, developing and/or launching new product ideas. The entire new product development cycle is well-captured. It is based on the author's personal/professional experiences and also her interviews with 20 other professionals.<br />This book contains a potent, streamlined, idea screening process, with six most important criteria: strategic fit, customer, competition, market, resources and profit. Each criterum is illustrated extensively, with examples, guidelines and discrete steps, by a separate chapter of the book. These chapters are worth the cover price of the book. To me, these areas are the most critical part of the new product development cycle.<br />The author also shares her many business models, which give you a refreshing look at strategy and planning for new products.<br />In the remaining chapters, the author touches on launching your new products and maintaining the momentum in the marketplace.<br />The accompanying CD contains many customisable templates, checklists and other tools. The author also has a website.<br />Throughout the book, the author emphasises two strategic parameters: agility (in the decision-making processes) and profitability, without which new product ideas are simply useless! All her evaluation frameworks and screening tools in the book are designed for this purpose in mind.<br />My only complaint about this book: it has a very scanty bibliography. To others, this may seem trivial but to me, it is important as I often like to know more about what or who has influenced the author's thinking processes.<br />Nevertheless, I like this book very much, particularly for all the realistic process frameworks. The author's writing style is crisp and succinct.

First of all, the title is intriguing. When I read the subtitle, I was immediately attracted to this book.<br />I have always been very fascinated by the subject \\"opportunity management\\" and will scout for and pursue books, used and new, that touch on this subject. I am very keen to find out how different people recognise it, seize it, and deal with it in disparate environments.<br />When I read the inside jacket cover: \\"...is for any project manager, change agent, team leader, systems and product developer who needs to identify and exploit opportunities and, at the same time, to manage risk and uncertainty...\\",  I knew I had found another good book on \\"opportunity management.\\"<br />The author has spent 36 years in industry, first as a scientist, project manager, and R & D head, and for the past 16 years as a management consultant.<br />I must say he approached the subject very well,  and he used a situational story in a corporate environment, involving a project executive (who is suffering from a daily diet of blame and shame for failed targets and missed deadlines; an irritating boss, irrational staff and irate customers; a job backlog, all of which are either emergencies, panics or mad crises - sound familiar?) and his mentor/colleague.<br />Written in a conversational style between the two, it is interspersed with  real-world problem cases and helpful checklists. Frankly, I did not enjoy the \\"story-line\\". I thought it was quite boring to some extent. In fact, I did not even finish reading the whole story.<br />However, I just browsed through some 250 pages quickly and randomly,  but noted down all the key points highlighted in bold print, and perused the summary at the end of every chapter, and also the consolidating summary at the end of the book. As a fast reader, I was more interested in the author's personal and/or professional experiences, and what his book can offer me in terms of learning points.<br />In a nutshell, I have not been disappointed.<br />In our fast-paced, rapidly-changing and constantly demanding world, this book offers refreshing insights about opportunity - and risk - management.  I like particularly the author's specific  categorisation of opportunities: copycat, windfall, hidden and imagineered opportunities, and his practical strategies for dealing with each of them. His perspectives about risk management are also very illuminating. The checklists offered by the author are very helpful and also very useful. I would recommend this book to every corporate executive, who wants to learn how to spot, to create and to manage opportunities in a high-risk, change-oriented environment.<br />I rank this absorbing book in the same genre as Art Turock's 'Invent Business Opportunties'; Edward de Bono's 'Opportunities'; Michel Robert's 'The Innovation Formula' & Peter Drucker's 'Innovation & Entrepreneurship'.n our fast-paced, rapidly-changing and constantly demanding world, this book offers refreshing insights about opportunity - and risk - management.

Of all the books I have read about the effective study process, this is the BEST!<br /><br />It is written in a clear, well-organized fashion, & the author does a marvellous job of doing what he sets out to do.<br /><br />I reckon the principal theme of this wonderful book is anchored on two premises:<br /><br />- school is a game;<br />- winning this game is only a question of strategy;<br /><br />The author, co-founder of the Princeton Review & developer of a revolutionary method for tackling the SAT since the early 80's, introduces an innovative & strategic approach to studying, which accentuates the core value of this book. It lies in the twelve powerful 'Cyberlearning Questions' which have been skillfully crafted by the author. These well-constructed questions will help you to think through and navigate the information overload in your text materials. The author gives a lot of specific study/reading examples to guide the reader.<br /><br />Most students treat reading/studying as a regurgitating process. In essence, reading/studying is a thinking - and reflective - process. Questions help you think and reflect better - and faster. Not only that, they help you retain and recall the learnt information faster.<br /><br />Think about it, a 'question mark' when inverted looks exactly like a 'fishing hook'. It 'hooks' into your memory banks. The 'Cyberlearning Questions' have been specifically designed for this purpose.<br /><br />For any student who wants to master his life in school and in college (or even in the university), and if you can just learn and then master these twelve questions, your life will be a breeze. Guaranteed!<br /><br />In fact, I would strongly recommend all teachers to read this book if they really want to help their students to excel in school. The twelve questions will greatly enhance their repertoire of teaching tools.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, I have incorporated (with some adaptations) all the twelve questions in my own training programs with teachers and school kids across all levels. For working professionals who want to read faster, these twelve questions can be easily adapted to cater to their reading needs. I have proven them in my own workshops with entrepreneurs, professionals and managers.<br /><br />In other words, this great book is also suitable for all working professionals, especially those taking evening MBA programs.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I would still recommend young readers to read this book jointly with Sean Covey's Seven Habits for Highly Effective Teens. This is my reason: The first three habits, namely, Be Proactive, Having the End in Mind, and First Things First, as outlined in the book, must come first for any student who wants to achieve personal success in school life.<br /><br />To put into perspective, once you exercise personal initiative, take consistent and prioritised action - and with a specific purpose in your mind, the strategy of using the twelve questions will easily fall into place.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, the author argues that successful students are not necessarily any more brilliant than the less successful ones, but have simply mastered powerful habits.<br /><br />In the case of matured students, please read Stephen Covey (the author's father)'s book.ionals who want to read faster, these twelve questions can be easily adapted to cater to their reading needs.

It has been fully expanded to cater to professional and businesspeople, and is now packed with many colourful illustrations.<br />I am very confident businesspeople will find this book useful in enhancing and expanding their visual-perceptual mode of thinking and problem solving.<br />In this book, the author stretches the traditional boundary of mindmapping as created by Tony Buzan in his many proprietary &quot;Mindmapping&quot; books since the mid-70s.<br />The author breaks some traditional &quot;Mindmapping&quot; rules in the process, which she now calls &quot;Mindscaping.&quot; This enables the reader to exercise the untapped and unlimited potential of the mind to create new working maps in the process of learning and thinking.<br />For professionals and businesspeople, her 'mindscaping' approaches can be adapted to suit any 'focused conversations' in a group or organisational setting.<br />I find Tony Buzan somewhat structured in his proprietary approach, and it is good that Nancy has done an excellent job to take a refreshing and &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; approach to traditional mindmapping. This gives much more meaning to the mindmapping process as it should be in the first place, and now makes it much easier to learn and apply in the real world.<br />For those readers who still think 'mindmapping' (or Tony Buzan) is great stuff, wait till you get hold of this book!<br />For beginners, Nancy's book is also a great help as she shows how to do simple iconic pictures.<br />For further exploration, I would recommend readers to buy and read Larry Raymond's Reinventing Communication, which showcases more business applications, particularly in the area of strategic planning. Milli Sonneman's Beyond Words is also worth exploring, especially in the area of group problem solving.<br />Kathy Mason's Going Beyond Words and David Hyerle's Visual Tools for Constructing Knowledge are also worth pursuing, especially if you are in the teaching/academic environment.are also worth pursuing, especially if you are in the teaching/academic environment.	2001-10-24

First of all, I think the title 'Biz Dev' is a misnomer. I reckon, to the author, Biz Dev is an eye catcher, and his book caught my eye while browsing it in a book store.<br />The book is more a ragtag collection of the author's generalised statements about building strategic relationships in our networked economy. He has artfully put his generalised statements into a 9-step process, each of which is appropriately packed with bullet points, for easy reading, across the many pages of the book.<br />Unfortunately, the author did not give specific and detailed information about 'how to go about it' of building the relationships. He talks a lot about 'continual dealing with the future', 'embracing chaos', 'speed and simplicity' and 'pro-active partner - and customer - orientations' but he skips the prescriptive guidelines. If he has put in more personal time and efforts in building his cases and then writing them here, I think the book would be substantially a much better read.<br />He outlines a lot of business cases to substantiate some of his generalised statements, and at the end each chapter, he also packs with a lot of website resources. In a way, he expects readers to do a lot of home work, in order to read his book.<br />In fairness to the author, I reckon his book may still be worth exploring by readers who are just beginners. This is because the book can still easily serve as an up-to-date but broad-brushed introduction to building strategic relationships in a knowledge-based economy.<br />For serious readers into business development, I believe Peter Skat-Rordam's Changing Strategic Direction: Practical Insights into Opportunity Drive Business Development would be an excellent choice.<br />In my personal view, one of the excellent books to explore about building strategic relationships is Developing Knowledge-Based Client Relationships - The Future of Professional Services by Ross Dawson.<br />Both books are my personal favourites.al favourites.	2001-10-23

Over the years, I have perused many, many books on entrepreneurial creativity, but this book is the only one that really covers the evaluating and testing of your ideas with great depth.

This is a really wonderful book. I bought this book strictly because I was fascinated by the work of one of the authors, Dr James Wandersee, even though biology is not my cup of tea. By chance, I \\"strayed\\" into his web-site, aptly called The 15 Degree Laboratory, while surfing the internet one day. (If you are curious to find out more, go to his web-site.) When I learnt, also by chance, that he had co-authored a book, I ordered it immediately from Amazon.com. Wow! What a great book!<br /><br />As a strategic explorer of knowledge and a very active practitioner in visual tools, I am always looking for other and better ways (or learning tools to be more precise) to build understanding, simplify complexity, map ideas and construct knowledge.<br /><br />Out of the book's table of contents, the following chapters (out of ten) attracted me the most at first glance:<br /><br />Chapter 1: overview of knowledge mapping; Chapter 5: meaningful and mindful learning; Chapter 7: using concept !circle diagramming as a knowledge mapping tool; Chapter 8: using concept mapping as a knowledge mapping tool; (the rest pertains to biology stuff)<br /><br />and I must say, I have learnt a lot from the authors.<br /><br />The above first two chapters give an excellent foundation to the book, and also examine the issue of meaning-making and meaning-building (the starting point of learning and understanding anything) from multiple perspectives. Kudos to the authors!<br /><br />The authors have very masterfully spin together an excellent exposition on knowledge mapping, with the proposition and application of two powerful visual tools, among many others in the book. I have deliberately picked these two tools because of my own personal and professional interests.<br /><br />One is concept circle diagramming, which to me is a terrific enhancement of the innocuous Venn Diagram (or its predecessor, the Euler Circle, if you are familiar with mathematics).<br /><br />The other is concept mapping, origi!nally made famous by Dr Joseph Novak, who wrote two excellent books on it - 'Learning How to Learn' and 'Learning, Creating & Using Knowledge.'<br /><br />Surprisingly, as academics, the authors write pretty well - crisp, succinct, and most of all, not boring.<br /><br />Although the authors have expounded them in the context of biology i.e. in the educational setting, I personally feel that the visual tools as propounded are very relevant to the corporate world. This is because, in understanding and simplifying complexity in a knowledge-based economy, the visual tools can serve as a powerful support system for the mind, create an arena in which we can make our knowledge explicit, reflect on its organisation and polish its edges. They are also useful for building and assessing our content and cognitive skills.<br /><br />I wish I have learnt these tools while I was in school or college. Learning would have been fun! And, life through the years would have been easier.<br /><br />For some reade!rs who think mind-mapping as created by Tony Buzan is great stuff, wait till you read this book and use the tools. If you are already familiar with mind-mapping, I would strongly recommend you to learn these visual tools, as a valuable supplement of your skill repertoire.<br /><br />It is my fervent hope that the authors of this book would sit down one day to re-write the book for the corporate world. - without the biology stuff, of course.

US	53057129	R3K1VYRSVAKWGN	0805835059	10151765	Creativity in the Classroom: Schools of Curious Delight	Books	5	27	27	N	N	A valuable resource for teachers, students, &amp; parents	I am always fascinated by creativity. Whenever I come across a creativity book, irrespective of whether it is intended for the business or academic world, I will always scan it first and if it appears \\"intriguing\\" judging from the front/back covers, table of contents and index page, I will often  peruse - and reflect on - it. I will often adapt the ideas to my consulting work. In this case, this book did not disappoint me.<br />In a nut shell, this is a book about practical strategies for teaching and learning creative thinking skills. Although it has been written primarily for teachers and students, I find that  many of the information on theory, strategies and assessment covered by the book are applicable and useful for anyone who is interested in exploring creativity, even in non-academic areas.<br />The main bulk of the book pertains to approaches to teaching the basic curriculum - mathematics, science, social studies, language - that encourage creative problem solving, and information on how research on motivation and creativity applies to decisions about classroom management, organisation and assessment.<br />The book is divided into two parts: \\"Understanding Creative People &amp; Processes\\" and \\"Creativity &amp; Classroom Life.\\".  The first part gives an excellent grounding in creativity fundamentals. The second part gives practical suggestions for creativity design, development &amp; assessment in a classroom setting.  For teachers, this part, especially the assessment tools,  is a real gem.<br />Very fortunately, the author's fluid writing style, coupled with her interesting case studies and numerous applications, makes the book easy-to-follow.<br />The author has very masterfully organised practical activities, such as \\"Thinking about the Classroom\\" and \\"Journeying and Journalling\\" in every chapter.  For readers, there are a lot of points to ponder, several questions to ask and many things to do. This is the part I enjoyed \\"playing\\" with them the most.<br />At the end of each chapter, and also in the bibliography, the author has listed many useful references for further exploration. For research purposes, this is a gold mine.<br />For parents, who are looking for simple ideas and practical strategies to develop creative activities for their children, I dare say this book is definitely a very helpful guide.<br />As a matter of fact, if you are just looking for creative opportunities in your own life, this book (particularly chapter 6) can be a valuable source of curious delight.r />At the end of each chapter, and also in the bibliography, the author has listed many useful references for further exploration.

I was attracted by the book's cover title, and also by the fact that Tony Buzan had a part in it.<br /><br />Although it was refreshing to follow the author's career path and some of his strategic decision-making processes, using a host of tools including mind-mapping and de Bono's stuff, I end up quite disappointed with the book. In fairness to the author, there are some small parts I really enjoyed.<br /><br />Let me start with the good points:<br /><br />The use of a \\"natural landscape\\" by the author to put de Bono's Six Thinking Hats in a total perspective is a very innovative and visually appealing approach. For example, this is how he illustrates de Bono's concept:<br /><br />Sun, to represent 'Yellow Hat' - for positives; Open Field to represent 'Green Hat' - for creative ideas; Blue Sky, to represent 'Blue Hat\\" - for overview; White Clouds, to represent 'White Hat\\" - for facts; Black Clouds, to represent 'Black Hat' - for negatives; Earth Fire, to represent 'Red Hat' - for fee!lings & emotions;<br /><br />This reinforces the argument that man has a natural proclivity towards visual metaphors. Kudos to the author!<br /><br />On page 115 of the book, the author shows a flow chart of how to use a combination of his own favourite thinking tools - mind-mapping, forced field analysis, cluster, brainstorming, 6 Thinking Hats - to solve a problem. The surrounding pages describe the step-by-step process in detail. Another kudos!<br /><br />Now, the not-so-good points:<br /><br />The 'leadership and change management' part in the book lacks strategic depth. The author was too perfunctory in these important aspects. A bit more research by the author would have made it more palatable for serious readers.<br /><br />It was good that the author lists out a good number of other thinking tools under the Appendix to Chapter 7. Unfortunately, I feel he does not do justice to those tools by adding sweeping personal statements of one or two-liners to each tool. Worst of all, he even a!dds that mind-mapping does it better, without a proper explanation (or compare & contrast). This to me reflects the author's vague understanding of the tools. e.g. cognitive mapping, flow chart and rich pictures. Even his one or two-liner description of 'scenario planning' is somewhat faulty.<br /><br />A quick browse of the author's scanty bibliography tells me that the author has not done enough homework and research.<br /><br />There were a lot of glaring mistakes in the book, Let me highlight a few.<br /><br />On page 80, under 'Some Facts about the brain' which reads 'The brain contains approx. 1 billion cells i.e. equivalent to 150 times the population of the planet.'<br /><br />Any 7-year-old internet-savvy kid can easily tell you that the numbers don't match!!!<br /><br />Also, on page 207 to 208, under 'Final review by Tony Buzan:<br /><br />'Leif Edmunsen' is a wrong name. The correct name is 'Leif Edvinsson,' who at one time was the Chief Intellectual Officer of Skandia, mentioned in t!he paragraph.<br /><br />The Prime Minister of Singapore is not Mr Ton. He is Mr Goh Chok Tong.<br /><br />Such silly mistakes reflect very poor editing work on the part of the author and the publishers.<br /><br />On the whole, I can only sum up that this book is still useful to any first-time manager, looking for a systematic approach to organisational decision making, with a hands-on feel.<br /><br />This book reminds me of another book, John O'Keeffe's Business Beyond the Box: Applying Your Mind for Breakthrough Results, from which I can draw a parallel here. In quite a similar vein, the author had built a successful career path through Procter & Gamble in Europe when he wrote the book. Likewise, the book offers a field-proven set of 8 thinking strategies, including mind-mapping.<br /><br />For serious readers, looking for solid leadership and change management strategies with an entrepreneurial perspective, it will be worthwhile for them to pursue 'The Individualised Corporation' by Sumantra! Ghosal & Chris Bartlett as well as 'First, Break All the Rules' by Marcus Buckingham & Curt Coffman.rst, Break All the Rules' by Marcus Buckingham & Curt Coffman.	2001-03-22

I was not enlightened very much. A couple of years ago,  I read Margaret Wheatley's Leadership &amp; The New Science, and also A Simpler Way.  I got a much better picture of the subject, and I began to take an earnest interest in the New Science. I read a few other authors' books but they did not strike a common chord with me, although they fueled my pursuit. I stumbled on to Irene Sanders' book by chance because of its cover title.<br />I was intrigued when I scanned the book index and found many interesting stuff: insight, foresight, geographic intelligence, Futurescape vs. Mindmap, imagery, new planning paradigm,  new science, perking information, scenario building, thinking in pictures, visual models, whole-brain functioning, etc.  All my kind of stuff.<br />I have read the book many times because of my deep personal interest in Strategic Thinking, and I have not been disappointed.<br />I love the author's break down of the Strategic Thinking process into two components:<br />- insight about the present; - foresight about the future;<br />and her argument that visual thinking stimulates both processes. She also defines and makes very clear distinctions between the terms `insight' and `foresight' as well as `forecast.' She then moves on to introduce her seven principles of Strategic Thinking in the context of the New Science, and elaborates at length her ten-step Futurescape mapping process.  To me, her Futurescaping is an extremely innovative expansion of the Mindscaping process created by Nancy Margulies in her book, Mapping Innerspace, which I had reviewed earlier.<br />She goes on further to  differentiate her Futurescape from the traditional mind-mapping process, developed by Tony Buzan. I thought that was great, as I have always felt that mind-mapping is  only good for organising personal notes and dumping quick ideas on to paper.  I love to play with the Futurescape mapping process, in the light of its ability to present the big visual picture, showing the dynamic interactions and inter-relationships of abstract concepts as well as complex issues.<br />With hindsight from my own consulting work, I am firmly convinced that Futurescaping can be a very powerful tool for strategic visioning by companies/organisations,  as part of their annual business planning exercise. It will allow \\"left-brain thinkers\\" to work harmoniously with \\"right-brain thinkers\\" to form a whole-brain approach for designing the preferred company future.<br />Frankly, just learning - and mastering - the Futurescaping process in your life and/or business will be worth more than the money you are going to spend on this book!<br />The book is divided into two equal parts: with Part 1: Understanding the New Science, and Part 2: The Art &amp; Science of Visual Thinking.  In the first part, she outlines and explains many of the New Science terms very well.  For once, \\"butterflies and hurricanes\\" make some real sense to me.  The second part is essentially the application part of the author's visual models. As the author puts it, it is also the framework for the new planning paradigm, as defined by the New Science.<br />While reading this book, it reminds me of another good book, The Next Common Sense, by Michael Lissack. There seems to be a common thread among the two books. Both authors argue and support very strongly the visual thinking metaphors as powerful tools for comprehending complexity. I strongly recommend readers to get hold of the book.<br />Again, this is another good book that you just can't read it in one go and put it on your shelf.  You have to peruse it, think about it, reflect, and then make use of the Futurescape mapping process. To paraphrase the author, `The present is the future in its most creative state.' Futurescaping will allow you to put  your creativity to work. On the whole, the author's writing style is very easy-going.ape mapping process, in the light of its ability to present the big visual picture, showing the dynamic interactions and inter-relationships of abstract concepts as well as complex issues.<br />With hindsight from my own consulting work, I am firmly convinced that Futurescaping can be a very powerful tool for strategic visioning by companies/organisations,  as part of their annual business planning exercise.

When I first saw the book cover/title, Thoughtware, on the Amazon.com website, I was very fascinated. It brought back sweet memories of a part of my corporate life.<br />It was back in the late 80's that I had the privilege to be associated professionally with two very innovative Swedish consultants: Jan-Erik Lundstrom and Leif Edvinsson.  I was then working under them in the development of software for real-time man-machine communications, known as EYESCREAM, created by Jan-Erik. It was then that I believed Leif actuallly coined the term \\"Thoughtware\\" for the first time, as he had already delivered papers on it in international conferences. (Leif subsequently went on to co-author two excellent books, Intellectual Capital: Realising Your Company's True Value by Finding its Hidden Brainpower in March 1997, and Intellectual Capital: Navigating the New Business Landscape in June 1998. I would recommend readers to explore these two books, as they documented the pioneering knowledge management work at Scandia, the largest financial services group in Sweden.)<br />It was my initial experimentation work with EYESCREAM in the late 80's that I began my life-long journey in understanding the intricacies - and the idiosyncracies - of the human mind, in the context of strategy formulation and development. I started gathering all kinds of books, magazine articles, newsletters  and research papers on the subject, to help in enhancing my life-long learning and real-world understanding.<br />In the mid-90s, came Amazon.com website, which actually helped me in sourcing the main bulk of the best books and other hard-to-get stuff on the brain/mind, learning, creativity, innovation, peak performance, change management, intellectual capital, strategic exploration, opportunity discovery, etc.<br />Now, back to the Thoughtware book, I must say this has become one of my favourite books. (Readers are welcome to explore some of my favourites in `Strategic Thinking Bookshelf,' `Opportunity Pathfinding Bookshelf,'  `Visual Thinking Toolkits for Business,' and `Business Blindspots, Illusions Mind-sets &amp; Paradigms' on the Amazom.com website).<br />Using the analogy of computer software, the authors of Thoughtware had very masterfully crafted a book in a creative and engaging style, with 3 major parts, against a smorgasbord of real-world business cases.:<br />Part 1: Context, introducing the performance drivers; Part 2: New Thoughtware, introducing the dynamics of intellectual capital; Part 3: Installation, introducing the installation framework for new thoughtware, involving 8 modules;<br />This is one good book which you just can't just read it in one go and put it on your shelf. You have to read it, think about it, reflect on it, synthesise it with your other reading stuffs, research your own experience, add what is specifically your own, come back to it and then plot out your next steps.<br />In a nut shell, let me recapitulate the essence of the book: What we do is rooted in our thoughtware.  This is the ancestor of  all our thinking and actions. The sum of the  people's thinking in an organisation and their collective interaction is the mastermind of the organization's performance. It is the underlying platform on which every organization operates. First, change the thoughtware in our heads, and we will automatically change our behaviour. We can then move on to create capability to manage the future.  We must constantly invest in new thoughtware, new operating platforms that become the foundation from which we generate learning, knowledge, innovation, change and growth.<br />The authors' contention in Thoughtware is exactly in line with the pioneering work of Edward de Bono, who wrote about the urgent need for FIRST ORDER THINKING in whatever we do, and who also coined the term 'LATERAL THINKING,' in the 70's. For more information about FIRST ORDER THINKING, read his books.<br />  I enjoy reading and working with this Thoughtware book very much, and appreciate also the authors in affirming their book at the onset as \\"a work in progress.\\"  The human mind is too vast and too complex to be explored and understood completely, and then captured in a 200-page book. I expect the authors to come out with their new work soon.and appreciate also the authors in affirming their book at the onset as \\"a work in progress.\\"  The human mind is too vast and too complex to be explored and understood completely, and then captured in a 200-page book.

Of so many business planning books, which I hold in high regard, this one is the simplest to read and follow, and yet still packed with useful tools and powerful tips.  To some extent, I would consider it to be  a no-frills, straight-to-the-point, hands-on kind of planning book.<br />In a nut shell, it provides a step by step approach, with a total of 9 steps, and involves 3 critical stages: gathering information, formulating ideas, and planning actions.<br />In fact, it has many thought-provoking  Prompt Questions and clearly-defined Checklists to help you execute your thinking and planning work - starting from scanning the environment (to find out what's out there), measuring your organisational health,  creating more options, right up to implementing an action plan with a monitoring system, using Gantt Charts.  These unique features are intended to stimulate and guide all your thinking processes, with each of the nine steps involving a different thinking process.<br />As a mater of fact, by the time you have gone through all the Prompt Questions and completed all the Checklists, you would have already thought through analytically, numerically, reflectively, predictively, imaginatively, visually, creatively, critically, empathetically, ethically, pragmatically and politically. Also, they have been structured in such a way that you would have developed strategic conversations skills with your people across all levels of the organisation, in the course of the planning exercise.<br />From a strategic thinking standpoint, this book really scores high marks from me, in spite of its simplicity.  When reading this book, it reminds me of two other good business planning books with practical \\"hands-on\\" features: `Breakaway Planning,' by Paul Levesque, whose book I have also reviewed earlier. In comparison, `Breakaway Planning' gives a more detailed treatment.

So, when I first browsed this book in a local bookstore, I was intrigued by several terms found in the Index page: strategic hypotheses, opportunity creation &amp; exploitation (OCE), business strategy as falsifiable hypothesis, falsification vs verification, asymmetries (natural, created), web of belief. I was even more surprised when I found terms like astrology and guided imagery in a mainstream book intended for general managers.  I bought the book and I have not been disappointed after reading it.<br />It took me quite a while to appreciate the author's intellectually provocative ideas about strategy formulation.<br />I find it quite informative to read the author's masterfully intertwining of contemporary models of breakthrough corporate strategies (real-life cases) with revolutionary concepts drawn from science, philosophy, military, political history as well as business history. However,  I still think he was a little bit too long-winded in the process.<br />The author's artful usage of the \\"Hammer and Pivot\\" metaphor (drawn from a successful historical military battle formation) in the Strategic Anatomy chapter (3) as a tool for internal capability assessment was quite a gem. This will definitely help to enhance the traditional SWOT Analysis in a company strategy formulation exercise. Overall, I find his insights refreshing.<br />In a nutshell, his brilliant arguments in the context of strategy formulation, can be summarised as follows:<br />1. A strategy is a hypothesis.<br />2. A strategy is a testable and falsifiable hypothesis.<br />3. Goals and mission statements are only the starting points for strategic hypotheses.<br />4. A falsifiable strategy has two basic elements for testing and verification: Conditions and Outcomes/Consequences. (The author puts a lot of emphasis here, and also shows how to use IF and THEN statements.)<br />5. To craft a successful strategic hypothesis, begin by asking questions. (The author provides some penetrating questions. They will help to spell out the conditions and consequences.)<br />6. When experience or experimentation falsifies a theory, learning naturally takes place, by doing, of course.<br />7. Strategy formulation is a work of constant refinement.<br />I enjoyed very much perusing the four chapters (5,6,7, &amp; 8) covering opportunity creation and exploitation (OCE), the two chapters (9,10) on corporate cultures and the web of belief, and the last chapter (11), which summarised the book in the form of Do's and Don'ts.<br />At the end of each chapter, the author provides many points to ponder (P2P),  several questions to ask (Q2A) and some things to do (T2D) in the form of \\"Consequences, Implications and Checklists.\\" I find these summariser/activator features to be very useful for readers, especially for me. They make the book so much easier to read and digest.<br />Summing up, this is a MUST-READ and MUST-DO book to be included in your Strategic Thinking Library.

I bought this book actually out of curiosity. It was pocket-size, and also visually very appealing. After perusing it, I have this feeling that this book is more intended for very young executives and/or new supervisors.<br /><br />In terms of basic steps, the book is just fine. In a nutshell, there are some two dozen of \\"strategic thinking\\" topics, which have been artfully rolled into the 72 brightly designed and easy-to-read pages, studded along the way with colurful boxed tips, 101 of them to be exact. It is designed for easy reading. There is even a simple but fun test at the end pages.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all beginners into the management field, as well as for older kids, who wants to learn how to think strategically. I wish I had this book when I was a young corporate rat.<br /><br />For a deeper treatment on the subject, I would suggest a quick browse of books in my Strategic Thinking Bookshelf (listmania).	2001-03-13

This is actually the paperback version of \\"Future Edge: Discovering the New Paradigms of Success,\\" by the same author. In fact, both books are sort of brief updates of the author's earlier book, entitled \\"Discovering the Business of Paradigms,\\" written in the mid-80s.<br /><br />Drawing essentially from the pioneering work of Thomas Kuhn, who wrote the classic, The Theory of Scientific Revolutions, in the 70's, this author has very artfully expounded the concept of paradigm shifting in the world of business, in contrast to the world of science. From a strategic exploration viewpoint, this is an excellent guide book.<br /><br />Understanding - and mastering - your paradigms is one important thing for making progress in life and in business, but I personaly feel that the real essence of this book is succinctly captured by the author in the five strategic exploration tools outlined in the book. The five tools are intended to help you to enhance your anticipation skills. They are the real gems of the book. [Bear in mind that the author is a process futurist, unlike most other futurists who write books & who are primarily content futurists. The five specific tools mentioned in the book are the exact process tools to aid & enhance your strategic exploration. Do not get carried away by the content part of the book pertaining to some perceived trends illustrated by the author.]<br /><br />In addition, the author defines the concept of paradigm very well & also elaborates at length on its key characteristics & effects, with illuminating examples.<br /><br />He highlights the importance of paradigm shift & anticipation. I particularly enjoyed exploring the two specific thought-provoking questions posed by the author:<br /><br />(1) What do I believe is impossible to do in my field, but, if it could be done, would fundamentally change my business?<br /><br />(2) Who, outside my field, might be interested in my unsolved problems?<br /><br />By thinking about & answering these two questions on your own, & against your own background, you will begin to understand the essence of the author's proposition. This will be the beginning of your own paradigm shift, as it has happened in my own life design for the second half.<br /><br />I would recommend readers to buy and read this book jointly with Wayne Burkan's Wide-Angle Vision. Wayne Burkan has been a collaborator of Joel Barker, and he introduces some more new and practical ideas to the paradigm phenomenon.<br /><br />Better still, view also and learn more from the videos (in which both authors are the lead facilitators), The Paradigm Prism and The Implications Wheel, which bring the whole paradigm concept to life and which showcase some more real-world business examples.<br /><br />If you want to explore your future, read this book!

I presume this is partly due to the author's training as a computer scientist. I find the book too strongly logic-oriented.

It gives a relatively good overview of opportunity discovery concepts/ideas but does not give much detailed information regarding the systematic process of decision-making and action planning. By comparison, Edward de Bono's Opportunities (or even Michel Robert's The Innovation Formula) is a much better book, especially its detailed coverage on the startpoint, endpoint strategies and evaluation strategies towards opportunity discovery. Also, the latter's coverage of the If-box opportunity mapping process is a gem. Nevertheless, Opportunity Spotting is still a worthwhile book to be included in an opportunity pathfinder's library.	2001-02-04

A very, well-written resource book on strategic thinking and decision making in the field of business development.<br /><br />For business owners, it makes fine distinctions between \\"business ownership\\" and \\"business leadership,\\" \\"strategic decisions\\" and \\"operational decisions,\\" and \\"driving forces\\" and \\"strategic choices.\\"<br /><br />In a nut shell, it is actually a business planning guide, but without all the usual jargon and mundane theories.<br /><br />I like the book's crisp and easy writing style as it provides broad perspectives and useful solutions to turn your preferred vision into your anticipated reality. The book is jam-packed with 8 worksheets, containing thought-provoking questions to set your mind into strategic thinking mode. I have always enjoyed reading books, where questions are interspersed in the pages by the authors. Henceforth, reading automatically becomes a very interactive exercise.<br /><br />Personally, I also feel that the entire essence of book is vis!ually captured in the strategic decision-making flowchart across Page 23 of the book, which is printed in large format. This will make your reading rather light and easy to follow.<br /><br />My only sore-point about this book is that it lacks an annotated bibliography at the end pages.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I would strongly recommend readers to get hold of a copy of the authors' workbook, Chart Your Own Course, which is an excellent companion to this book - for real-life, hands-on guided utilisation of the strategies. It is available from the authors' website mentioned in the book.<br /><br />Winding up, this is a really worthwhile resource book to be included in your Strategic Planning Library.	2000-10-31

This particular business book is one of the very few business titles I have come across so far.<br /><br />Although written from a strategic thinking perspective, it emphasises on the systematic pursuit of business opportunities as a way of generating company growth and establishing strategic direction. It also provides a very clear distinction between the traditional strategy approach and the new opportunity approach to strategic thinking.<br /><br />Backed by practice-based field research, and some relevant business cases, it has a lot of useful ideas and hints on how to spot and pursue opportunities systematically, from discovering, refining, evaluating, funding them to managing and controlling them.<br /><br />After perusing it, I would have thought that the sub-title of this book, \\"Practical Insights into Opportunity Driven Business Development,\\" should have been the main title, instead of \\"Changing St!rategic Direction.\\" If you are a business opportunity seeker, or if you just want to try a different approach to business development, this is an excelent guide and toolkit.<br /><br />On the whole, I also like the author's writing style - crisp, succinct and easy-going. This is generally reflective of Scandinavian business authors/consultants, even though English is not their first language.	2000-08-23

To me, this is the most simplest and yet  powerful creativity book. Better still, a powerful creativity toolkit. He  uses over 20 animal metaphors to explain and illustrate how we can learn  from nature to be creative. Nature has always been man's greatest teacher.  The author' extensive illustrations from nature show his power of acute  observation, which to me is also an important yet learnable tool in  creative thinking. For example, he says &quot;Observe Like a Lion&quot; as  a starter. A lion will always observe closely its target prey from a  distance before going for the kill. Metaphorically, one should always study  a problem closely from various angles or perspectives and then plan out a  strategy before attempting to solve it. With over 20 metaphors - thinking  tools to be precise - and tightly written in a crisp and succinct style,  this small book is  a recommended must-read for everybody - adults and kids  alike - who wants to improve - and enhance - their everyday thinking  processes.	2000-05-24

This author does very well and quite in depth. Also, he outlines the scenario building process (a seemingly complex thinking process according to several business/management books) in only 7 simple steps. He has a website which readers can access using a password code given in the book but unfortunately his does not have much new stuff other that what is already in the book.<br />The book is also interspersed with insightful interviews with leading thinkers, whose books I have also enjoyed reading, e.g. Alvin Toffler, Richard Saul Wurman, Thoedore Modis, and Andrew Garvin.<br />On the whole, this is a very light, easy-to-read and no-frills book, and I strongly recommend it to all entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs.	2000-05-18

This is one book that shows you the tactical and yet practical approaches to gaining a strategic advantage in your business.<br /><br />One of the best learning tools I got out of this book is the power of observation through the application of peripheral vision. The author calls it \\"splatter vision\\" or \\"wide angle vision\\" which he uses  as the book's main title. I understand from my American friends that this is an age-old technique practised by native North American Indians. Henceforth, it is now practised by nature observers, bird watchers and animal trackers.

The ideas and techniques expounded can also be applied to group project planning and management.<br /><br />Compared to David Straker's Rapid Problem Solving with Post-It Notes, this is a much better book, because of its depth of coverage and many real-world examples, including nonprofit outfits. I must add that David S!traker's book, though also well-written and illustrated, is geared primarily towards more and other innovative uses of the common Post-It Notes in the field of problem solving, business or otherwise.	2000-04-05

This gives much more meaning to the mindmapping process as it should be in the first place, and now makes it much easier to learn and apply in the real world.<br /><br />For beginners, Nancy's book is also a great help as she shows how to do simple iconic pictures.<br /><br />For more interesting ideas, I would recommend readers to buy and read Milli S!onnenman's Beyond Words, which showcases some business applications.<br /><br />Kathy Mason's Going Beyond Words and David Hyerle's Visual Tools for Constructing Knowledge are also worth pursuing, especially if you are in the teaching/academic environment.<br /><br />I understand that the author is coming up with an expanded version for business applications. Watch out for it at Amazon.com.	2000-04-04

I enjoyed reading this book very much - not only from the strategic exploration standpoint.<br /><br />On top of sharing his own personal and professional experiences of applying the strategies in Royal Dutch/Shell group, the author gives an excellent explanation about our innate human ability to strategise, since our caveman days. Once you understand his explanation, you will begin to realise why scenario building is quite a piece of cake.<br /><br />Neverthesless, I would strongly recommend readers to read this book in conjunction with Peter Schwartz's The Art of the Long View. The reason is this: this book gives you only the WHAT? and the WHY? while Peter Schwartz's gives you the WHAT? and the HOW?. Both books complement each other.<br /><br />If you want to be a strategic explorer, - and also to reclaim/maximise your innate ability to build scenarios - buy & read both books!	2000-04-03

I would rank this book side by side with Edward de Bono's \\"Opportunities: A Handbook of Business Opportunity Search\\". I have read both books in the late 80's.<br /><br />In the field of deliberate opportunity search, these are the only three books that have been written on the subject, as far as I know. This is one of them.<br /><br />Strategy-wise, and from the strategic business/competitive perspective, this book has an EDGE over the other two books in the genre.<br /><br />The theme of the book is making innovation a learnable, repeatable & disciplined business practice. In this respect, the author has done a great job. Additionally, he has also identified the ten opportunity-sensitive areas (or windows of opportunity) in business, and also outlined strategies and tips to help you work out your action plans to pursue them systematically. In a way, he has expanded on what Peter Drucker has covered earlier in the latter's book, 'Innovation and Entrepreneurship' in which the latter has identified only seven sources of innovative opportunities.<br /><br />I have also read most of the author's other books. His forte is strategic thinking - more precisely, strategic exploration. Excellent stuff throughout, with penetrating insights and real-world examples to follow, and the author's writing is very crisp, succinct and clear, just like his other books.<br /><br />If you want to be an opportunity seeker, please read this book!	2000-04-03

The real monetary value of this book lies in the detailed and yet comprehensive QUESTIONING process, which the book outlines in strategic depth. Not only it breaks down the questioning process into three consecutive phases - status-quo, brainstorming,&amp; activity planning -  with specific examples of real-world questions to ask in each planning  phase, it sort of holds the reader's hand (and his attention) all the way  to addressing all the EIGHT strategic questions (another good monetary  value) in designing and actualisng a company's long-term future. It's  really a field-tested, practice-oriented book for strategic visionising.  Not many strategic visionising books can do that well. I particularly like  the author's writing style - very crisp, succinct and clear. A MUST READ!	2000-04-03

To be more precise, it's about visual perceptual thinking - the often untapped resource mode of our brain. It is an excellent resource - not only from the visual thinking perspective  but - for those who wants a deeper, fundamental understanding about  whole-brain thinking. Unlike Kurt Hanks' books, and ironically, it's full  of heavy text. Nevertheless, it's worth your perusal and also for having it  in your personal library. The author had a second book, a strategy manual,  which, unfortunately, is now out of print.	2000-04-03

This is the first book I have read about scenario planning. I was led to this wonderful book as a reader of Whole Earth Review.<br /><br />I reckon it would be worthwhile to read this book jointly with Arie de Geus's The Living Company. Both books explain very well our innate human ability to strategise - to build future scenarios in our heads - since our caveman days!<br /><br />With this understanding and insight, you will now begin to reclaim and maximise your inborn ability to explore and create your own future, in business or otherwise.<br /><br />In Peter's book, the scenario building process is explained at length, with quite easy-to-follow steps.<br /><br />The two books complement each other. One point I want make very clear: In some way, Peter gives you only the WHAT? and the HOW? while Arie's gives you the WHAT? and the WHY? about scenario building in their respective books.<br /><br />I particularly like Peter's book because he urges you to REPERCEIVE - a much more powerful !word than RETHINK - whatever you think & do, and also to stay abreast of trends and changes by perusing all kinds of stuff from the FRINGES, on top of your mainstream stuff. A true strategic explorer does both!<br /><br />I always feel that reading fringe stuff gives you an edge. This is also one of similar major themes (pertaining to secondary sources for reading) pursued by Joel Arthur Barker and Faith Popcorn in their respective books.<br /><br />It is also worthwhile to explore the author's website, Global Business Network (GBN), especially about further books to read.<br /><br />To sum up, this is a MUST READ book for your strategic exploration!	2000-04-03

From a opportunity finding viewpoint, it's quite disappointing, personally speaking. Although the coverage on the aspect of creative thinking is very broad and somewhat deep in many respects, with good,  useful strategies/techniques and examples to follow, it does not offer much  in terms of opportunity finding approaches for the business reader. For  that, you need to buy and read Michel Robert's &quot;Innovation  Formula&quot;, and/or Edward de Bono's &quot;Opportunities&quot;, and/or  &amp; Nigel MacLennan &quot;Opportunity Finding.&quot; Neverthesless, this  book is still worthwhile to be bought/read and kept in your personal  library. Reading it is like reading many creative thinking books in one go.  The author drew a lot - I mean really a lot - of creativity stuff from  other books.	2000-04-03

I particularly like the authors' use of powerful  visual metaphors to understand &amp; to master the complexity all around  us, and to chart out new strategic directions, whether in business or in  life. If you are planning what you want to do with the rest of your life in  our constantly changing &amp; uncertain world - or planning the next  strategic moves for your company- read this book and use the ideas. The  authors' website is also worth exploring.	2000-04-02

It uses the long-successful, field-tested, somewhat structured  but proven effective Creative Problem Solving (CPS) method. Sid is a  veteren in the creativity field.

For examples, a story grid - which is not covered in the book - would be more appropriate to shape understanding of literature texts; a time line or time series - also not overed - would be more appropriate to track chronological events in history textbooks.<br /><br />For the businessman, this book can be somewhat boring, although one or two of the tools e.g. cluster and fishbone diagrams, can be used to organise visually one's thoughts or ideas while reading business books.<br /><br />For bu!siness use, I would strongly recommend Terry Richley's The Marketer's Visual Toolkit (Amacom)and/or Larry Raymond's Reiventing Communication. Both titles offer a very broad range of powerful visual tools for strategic thinking, planning, communication and problem solving. There are gems for the business user.<br /><br />Even Nancy Margulies' Mapping Inner Space book (which I have also reviewed) is worth exploring.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this book is still worth reading, especially if you want a deep understanding of why we are 'visual'. Also, David Hyerle's tools and ideas are still useful for the business reader, especially if one is pursuing business management studies e.g. MBA, in the evenings. The visual tools can be useful in that respect, particularly for probing understanding through the text, and taking/making personal notes.	1999-10-10

This is so far the best book I have come cross on visual thinking for sales and marketing professionals. It covers a very broad range of visual tools for strategic thinking, planning, communication and problem solving in the field of sales and marketing.<br /><br />My only complaint about the book is that some of the business examples given are somewhat perfunctory. A more detailed treatment of each \\"businesss problem case\\" in the book would have given the book much more depth, and make it easier for business readers to follow and adopt the concepts/approaches. Nevertheless, the amount of visual thinking concepts/approaches introduced in the book are well worth your money spent to buy the book. Apparently, it is now a classic, and sadly, out of print.<br /><br />I would recommend readers to explore Larry Raymond's Reinventing Communication, which has a slant towards strategic planning, but nevertheless gives a more detailed treatment on the same subject.	1999-10-10

It is easy to read and/or refer to, and it does give a relatively good overview of opportunity spotting concepts/ideas but  does not give much detailed information regarding the process of  decision-making and evaluating actions to be taken. By comparison, Edward  de Bono's Opportunities book is a much better book, especially its detailed  coverage on the startpoint, endpoint strategies and evaluation strategies  towards opportunity spotting. Also, the latter's coverage of the In-box  opportunity mapping process is a gem.  Nevertheless, Opportunity Spotting  is still a worthwhile book to be included in an opportunity spotter's  reference library.	1999-10-10
