If you are interested in what is really happening on the Front Lines of our President's War on Terror, this book will hit the mark.  Unfortunately, given the tenuous relationship between Iraq and Terrorism, you won't find much information on the causes of and remedies for terrorist acts.  What this book delivers is a hard-hitting and gripping account of day to day life as a National Guard soldier in Iraq.  From crappy, hand-me-down equipment to drug abuse and moral decay, John Crawford's personal story should be read by anyone contemplating a career in the military and anyone who wants to look beyond our Government's sugar-coated views and the Media's sanitized views of the conflict in Iraq.  This book is excellent.	2005-10-09

This book left me with a vague feeling of unease.  It was as if I were on the edge of a great enlightenment and then...the book ended.  There is some interesting material on Remote Viewing, but you should note that you need at least one partner to practice for the most part.  Since this is not a topic of much interest in the Midwest, I don't think I'll be able to practice much.<br /><br />I purchased this book because I was looking for a scientific examination of psychic experiences.  I got some of what I was looking for, but I also got a lot of personal stories and anecdotes that were interesting, but not necessarily enlightening.  I enjoyed this book and would recommend it as an introduction to the techniques for Remote Viewing.  If you are looking for a more broad-ranging work, try \\"The Field,\\" by Lynne McTaggart.	2005-10-04

His ideas have always intrigued me, but I found his writing style to be rambling and confusing.  This book, however, is an excellent introduction to Fuller's life and ideas, without the confusing detritus.  I don't have a strong math or science background, so I appreciated the fact that the author was able to explain Fuller's ideas without resorting to complex equations or formulas.  The biographical aspects of this book are also quite interesting.  It is chronologically arranged so that the reader can track the evolution of Fuller's thoughts as he progressed through life.	2005-09-18

Beowulf is a wonderful epic story, but if you've read a poor translation you won't appreciate that fact.  Mr. Heaney has created a terrific translation that reads smoothly and coherently. As a result of reading this version, I developed a new appreciation for the story on account of being able to understand nuances that I had missed before.  Beowulf's journey from his struggle with Grendel to his final battle with the Dragon can be viewed as a metaphor for almost any life, and this translation allows the reader to appreciate what the story says about how life should be lived and about how one should approach death.  The fact that the book is split with the original text on the left and the translation on the right, illustrates how much our language has changed in a thousand years.  I enjoyed the diversion of trying to interpret the orignal text on my own.	2005-09-10

The premise of this book is to look at your interactions with the world from a different perspective than what most people exercise.  Rather than thinking that the whole world is out to get you, the author suggests the idea that maybe the universe is working in a vast conspiracy to help you.  When you get right down to it, the thought is both liberating and uplifting.  As someone who is still trying to shake off the prudishness of 20 years in the Lutheran Church, portions of the book concerning sexuality were a little disturbing, but not so much as to sour the whole experience.  This is an innovative piece that isn't really easy to characterize.  Sometimes it rambles a little, but it still ranks highly as a uniquely exhilarating book.  If you are weary of news of war and destruction, this is the antidote.	2005-08-29

The imagery of the end of a life is stark in this book, but the message is quite profound.  There is nothing to be romanticized about Ivan Ilyich's death.  It is a slow spiral into decay, that actually begins long before the physical symptoms of his illness arise.<br /><br />  If you ever feel like you're caught on a treadmill of materialism, this book will hit you like a splash of cold water in the face.  There aren't many books with the potential to be truly life-changing, but this is certainly one of them.	2005-08-21

Needless to say, my mathematical skills are minimal.  I have read many books on Quantum Physics and have been frustrated by my failure to understand much of what I had read due to my mathematical limitations.  The Field was a welcome exception to this problem for me and I really enjoyed it.  If you have ever wondered about the Universal forces that connect all of us, this is a great place to begin your exploration.  The book is heavily footnoted and has an extensive bibliography for readers who want to explore the subjects further.  While some may take issue with the theories expounded in this book, I think it is an excellent scientific companion piece to the works of Deepak Chopra and Wayne Dyer.	2005-08-18

I really enjoyed this book, especially the first few chapters.  The author does a good job of explaining cell biology and makes a compelling argument that the cell membrane is the functional equivalent to the brain in multi-cellular entities.  He cites fascinating evidence to demonstrate the importance of belief in our health and psychological well-being.  However, I expected some practical advice on how to apply this knowledge to my own personal experience and I was somewhat disappointed.  There is a very good chapter regarding the ways parents can have a positive impact on the development of their children, starting as early as conception, but that is essentially the final chapter and I was left wondering how to apply this information outside the parenting arena.  This complaint aside, the book is well documented and has some very interesting things to say about the pharmaceutical industry and health care in general.  I consider it a very good investment of my reading time, but I hoped for more.	2005-07-30

I enjoyed this book in that it caused me to think about how something relatively unimportant in the grand scheme of things can have such a tremendous impact on world history.  Mr. Coulombe does an excellent job of tracing the history of rum from its origins in the 1600's through to the present day.  The importance of rum in the Triangle Trade and the development of Colonial America is detailed in an interesting, yet scholarly manner.  As an added bonus, the author includes rum-based recipes for mixed drinks and food items.  If you are interested in the development of the American Colonial economic base, slavery, piracy on the high seas, or just how rum is made, this book will fill the bill.	2005-07-20

If you haven't been exposed to these ideas in another form, the book might be just a little confusing, but still certainly worth your trouble.

Mr. Weissman does an excellent job of breaking down the Art of thinking on your feet and turning it into a Science.  Utilizing real-life examples that most everyone will remember from past political campaigns, the author analyzes what went right and what went wrong, and then tells you how to replicate the successes and eliminate the failures.  If you are involved in politics, law, business or public relations, this book will be a great investment.  It is concise, to the point, and pulls no punches. The methods are adaptable to most every situation and don't require a lifetime of study to learn.	2005-06-29

I gave it 4 Stars since it was interesting and informative, but I didn't think it covered both aspects well enough.  Mr. Gonzalez starts with his own Father's story of being shot down during World War II, but doesn't finish the story until later in the book, after discussing many scientific aspects of survival and other survival stories as well.  I personally would have preferred to read about entire stories, followed by scientific information.  The chosen technique was disjointed.  Aside from that criticism, I found that the book contained useful information on steps that could be taken to develop a survivor mindset.  I'm not saying that you could learn to cut your own arm off if you were trapped under a boulder in the wilderness, but it is possible that you could learn about behaviors and techniques that might keep you out of trouble in the first place and help you make better decisions in a crisis.	2005-06-12

Absent an inheritance from a rich uncle, I just don't think it is possible to be a success in any endeavor unless you develop your mindset in a manner similiar to that advocated here.  This book teaches workable techniques to allow you to rein in your thought processes.  Some of the techniques are based upon affirmations/declarations and some are based upon goal setting and visualization, but the bottom line is that your ACTIONS have to follow your thoughts.  This book can give you the means to translate thought into action.  It is easy to read, but sometimes hyperbolic.  If you can get past the hyperbole, you'll find many useful gems.	2005-05-12

This isn't a textbook on economics, but rather a brilliant example of what kinds of things economics can teach us, if we are willing to put aside the esoteric ramblings about supply and demand and marginal utility that bored us to death in college.  The authors answer interesting questions, such as: \\"What attributes of a parent signal an academically successful child?\\" and uses regression analysis and other tools to develop a list of those attributes.  These are explained without a single mathematical formula in the entire book.  Other interesting questions include: \\"Why do most crack dealers live with their mothers?\\" and \\"Can a parent's selection of a child's name impact the future of a child?\\"<br /><br />  This book was extremely readable and interesting.  I finished it in about a weekend and it gave me lots of interesting things to think about and talk about.  Some people are dismayed about the authors' conclusion that the legalization of abortion caused a decrease in the crime rate, but you should note that the authors take pains to point out that this analysis does not constitute a justification of either side of the abortion debate.  The correlations are explained and are difficult to dispute.  In any event, I think this is a fabulous book.	2005-05-01

I would probably give the book 4.5 stars, since too much of it is devoted to name dropping, but this small flaw does not detract from the value of the book.  Mr. Ferrazzi takes the approach of building meaningful relationships with others, even when time is short.  He doesn't advocate carpet bombing a room with your business cards or hanging out with people you despise as a means of getting ahead.  I appreciate the fact that the author came from humble beginnings and was able to reach such heights in the world of business.

Dave Ramsey makes a compelling argument for the elimination of all debt by rather extreme means.  He exposes the common myths spread by the credit industry and offers a solution for eliminating debt through something he calls The Debt Snowball.  My only complaints center around the fact that he advocates mutual funds as a means to achieving 12% returns over the long run and that he advocates National Guard service as a means of paying for college.  I'm not sure that mutual funds can be counted on for 12% in the long run, and National Guard service these days can involve exciting times in far away locations like Iraq,  which make the cost/benefit analysis a bit unappealing.  However, this isn't a book about investing and the college financing advice is otherwise quite helpful.  I'm sold on the concept of The Total Money Makeover!	2005-02-11

This book contains 7 chapters that are designed to be read on a weekly basis, with blank pages for notes and observations between each chapter.  There is some good advice in this book, that should fit pretty well into many belief systems.  Although much of the book can be described as monotheistic, the philosophy is fairly inclusive.  Some of the terminology is a bit dated, since the book is based on workshops that Lester Levinson conducted around 30 years ago.  If you want a more comprehensive approach to this topic, you might explore the book, The Sedona Method, by the same authors.	2005-01-30

It is an attempt to examine an important life, that was lived over 2,500 years ago.  Given the fact that The Buddha and his followers didn't choose to create a cult of personality, there aren't many available sources for information about the human side of The Buddha.  As such, I think the author did a good job of examining the world that The Buddha experienced and piecing together limited information to add a human element to an enlightened being.  I was especially touched by the account of The Buddha's final days, when he was venerated by many, but chose to pass on in relative isolation as a means of furthering his message.  If you are looking for philosophical insights, you should look elsewhere, but if you want to know about the world from which The Buddha sprang, this is a good, readable choice.	2005-01-22

This is Frightening	This book has caused me to re-examine my thinking about eating non-organic meat.  First of all, let me state that I am not a vegetarian and, having been raised on a farm, have always been a beef eater.  However, this book's analysis of the possiblity of a prion-tainted meat supply has caused me to explore other options to store purchased meat.  While much of the evidence is anectdotal, it is compelling nonetheless.  The author looks at brain wasting diseases among humans in New Guinea, sheep and cattle in Britain and deer and elk in America.  He demonstrates a potential link between Mad Cow-like illnesses and the increase in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in the United States, and has an interesting theory on outbreaks of cattle mutilations.  Given the fact that these brain wasting diseases can take years to manifest themselves and that we are relying on a testing scheme by the USDA that covers less than one percent of the beef supply, it seems prudent to look for alternatives and press for more safeguards.  The author points out that by turning herbivore cattle into cannibals by feeding them rendered beef byproducts as a low cost protein source, we may be responsible for an epidemic of Biblical proportions.

I had heard about Krishnamurti for years before I took the plunge with this book.  It is probably one of the best introductions to his work since it consists of introductory material and question and answer sessions with Indian students.  As such, the complex web of ideas is made a little easier to see.  The book is broken down into short chapters related to everyday issues such as Freedom, Ambition and the Quest for Knowledge.  I especially enjoyed the discussions regarding the purpose of education.  Krishnamurti would not be a fan of our system of emphasis on test results over all else.  The purpose of education is not rote learning and ticket punching, but rather the development of the ability to think in a critical fashion for yourself and develop your own path.  This is a great book to read from start to finish and then leave in a convenient spot to pick up and peruse as the mood hits.	2005-01-02

By releasing your emotional baggage, a person can experience the freedom to enjoy life in the moment.  This is excellent advice that is explained in meticulous detail.  While I think the level of detail is necessary to truly grasp and practice the concept, I did find it difficult to complete all of the exercises in the book.  I found that I got the most out of the book if I set aside at least a half hour at a time to read and do the exercises.  I found it interesting that the release of positive emotions, as well as negative ones was advocated.  On a personal level, I found the techniques to be helpful, but not yet life transforming.

However, the Chinese and the Europeans are in the early stages of teaching us a hard lesson.  This book addresses the myth that \\"Old Europe,\\" is irrelevant.  The economic and social power that is emerging in the European Union will have to be dealt with by our children, who will still be paying the bill for our misguided imperialism.  This book highlights the history of the unification efforts and discusses the factors that are emerging which are drawing the European people together.  I found the book to be highly readable and compelling, although I didn't necessarily agree with all of the author's assertions.	2004-12-06

This book is truly compelling and completely enjoyable.  The descriptions of the Battles of Issus and Gaugamela are the best that I've ever read concerning Alexander's field generalship. Figuring out how an ancient battle might have unfolded is difficult, but the descriptions in this book are clear and exciting.  My only complaint is that the book is too short, leaving out much of Alexander's siege work and activities in Egypt.  The portrait of this leader that emerges is probably more sympathetic than some treatments, but Pressfield makes a good attempt to get inside Alexander's head in this first-person account.  From today's perspective, It was interesting to note that Alexander was able to triumph over numerically superior forces with ease, while it took him 3 years of brutal struggle to confront guerilla warriors in what is now Afghanistan.  Even genius has its limits.	2004-11-21

Our culture has twisted the image of what constitutes a healthy weight into a standard that would be considered anorexic from just about any historical viewpoint.  The scientific evidence that obesity is a health risk is largely without merit.  Mr. Campos exposes the flawed methodology of the flagship studies on obesity that tout the concept of health that begins at a Body Mass Index below 25.  If you've agonized over losing twenty or thirty pounds and if you've fallen for the low carb, low fat, low calorie hype, you may find comfort and perhaps the ability to accept yourself after reading this book.	2004-10-16

Tolkien	Books	4	51	52	N	Y	Not Always Flattering, but Very Revealing	If you have an idealized view of JRR Tolkien that you want to protect, you might want to avoid this book.  The letters can be funny and extremely interesting, but sometimes I felt as if I were reading about matters that Mr. Tolkien considered private and that he might have wanted kept that way.  He writes several letters about money being tight and taxes being high (\\"progressive tax rates in England at the time were around 90%), and he also has several letters that aren't necessarily flattering to American taste.  However, there are also magically insightful letters dealing with linguistic issues and filling out some questions from The Lord of the Rings.  Many common assumptions about Tolkien are challenged by this book.  For instance, I always assumed that Tolkien and C.S. Lewis were quite close until Lewis passed away, but some of the letters reveal a distance that emerged between them as Lewis became involved with the woman he ultimately married.  I also enjoyed Tolkien's views on Catholicism, although I am not Catholic.	2004-10-14

The are interesting chapters on using probiotics to treat cancer and autism, but I was more interested from the standpoint of maintaining healthy digestion.  If you have taken any antibiotics, there is a good chance that your intestinal flora is out of whack and that probiotics can help.<br /><br />  In any event, my only complaint is that the information is rather sparse in terms of general health questions given the price of the book.

If you struggle with your weight and have all the information you can swallow about limiting carbs or reducing fat, this program is for you!  This isn't just a hypnotic script about positive thinking; it's a well-reasoned program that uses hypnosis to recruit the power of your subconscious mind to help you reach your goals.  By following the program, I lost fifteen pounds before I was half way through it.  I noticed that I didn't seem to have the same degree of discipline problems that I had experienced before.  I was able to stop mindless, comfort eating and begin an exercise program that continues to keep my interest.<br /><br />  Victoria Wizell has a great voice and all of the sessions are quite pleasant.  I have benefited from other programs that she has produced and have found the technical quality of her programs to be quite high.	2004-10-01

It covers critical stories about civil rights, the electronic voting scam and the real dangers to our troops in Iraq with candor that is unmatched.  While most of the criticism is leveled at the Bush Administration, I consider this book to be a truly fair and balanced look at the issues the media refuses to cover on account of rampant corporate control over the major networks and the failure of journalists to do anything more than report what they are told by their corporate/governmental masters.  I'm an Independent voter and found this book to be extremely enlightening.  Don't read it if you have anger management issues.	2004-10-01

I'm not from Hawaii, so I don't know anything about whether Huna has a Hawaiian origin or not and, as a practical matter, the origins of the concept don't really concern me.  This book offers practical advice on expanding your spiritual life in a way that is not tied down by the strictures of the Christian Church (I'm not attacking the Church, but some people want the freedom to seek an alternative).  In my opinion, the best part of the book is the extended, final chapter entitled \\"Huna for Everyday.\\"  This chapter contains 80 pages of practical advice on using Huna techniques to address everyday problems.	2004-09-11

This book contains a series of aphorisms ranging from a couple of lines to a couple of pages.  As such, it is easy to pick and choose things that interest you.  The problem is that Nietzsche wrote the aphorisms in a deliberate order, so looking at one passage in isolation is an express route to misunderstanding.  This is especially true with respect to the sections that discuss Women and Jews.  I found that I had the best success in understanding the book when I ignored the footnotes (they usually refer to German translation issues that are lost on non-German speakers) and simply plowed through several sections at a time.  I think this work really sheds some light on the issues facing the European Union today.  Nietzsche had an interesting perspective on the differences among Europeans and his observations are quite relevant to the struggle to unify the continent.	2004-09-11

Before using these CDs I had trouble recalling any of my dreams in more than a fragmentary sense.  The first night I listened to the initial session, I was able to remember a good portion of my dreams in vivid detail.  I'm not particularly susceptible to hypnotic suggestion, but this product was the most effective that I have ever used.<br /><br />  Ms. Wizell has a pleasing voice and manner, buttressed by a superb hypnotic script.  She structures the sessions to be utilized at any time of day, giving you the option of stopping the recording if you simply want to drift off to sleep.  I used these CDs once I was ready for bed and stopped before the final \\"alert and awake\\" suggestions were given.  As a result, I was able to drift off into a peaceful slumber minutes after the CD, as opposed to the half hour that I usually need to fall asleep.<br /><br />  As I have progressed through the sessions I have been able to utilize my dreams to help process and interpret items within my own psyche.  I feel a closer connection to my subconscious and I feel like I have a better handle on what is going on in my mind and how I can effectively address conflicts.  Highly recommended!	2004-09-10

As other reviewers have stated, this book is one of two that Jung meant for public consumption.  It makes for an excellent introduction to dream interpretation and symbolism, but isn't meant to help you interpret your own dreams by providing a list of symbolic meanings as some texts do.  Rather, Jung (who wrote the initial essay) and the other authors provide the basic framework for understanding the mechanics of dream interpretation. The concluding piece on Science and the Unconscious, although the shortest essay, is very interesting and provides tantalizing insights into the relationship between physics and psychology.  The book was still a challenging work to read and took me quite some time to finish.  It was worth the effort.	2004-08-16

Unfortunatly, as this excellent book details, it was all a fabrication. Mr. Bovard takes the major initiatives of the President and demonstrates with sickening detail that this administration is built upon a foundation of lies, bringing us closer to a totalitarian state than I would have believed possible from a Republican president. The author exposes the &quot;Leave No Child Behind&quot; boondoggle as a blatant attempt to wrest the education of our children from local control in favor of federal control. From the Patriot Act to the War on Drugs, Bovard demonstrates that our civil liberties are in jeopardy like never before. This book is extensively end-noted with references for every damning fact. Lest you think this is a Democratic Party sponsored hatchet job, please note that the author takes great pains to point out the complicity of the Democrats in Bush's march to a police state. The fundamental difference between Democrats and Republicans these days is slight. The results of that fact are frightening.	2004-07-25

However, the title had led me to believe that this book focused on material advancement, whereas the author actually focuses upon being rich within the totality of circumstances.  While there is a good deal of discussion about material prosperity, there is a decidedly spiritual slant to the message.  Like other Murphy books, there are many scriptural references to be found here, but I want to emphasize that this isn't a dogmatic, religious approach to prosperity.  The book contains many anecdotal stories that illustrate the points the author is making.  In a nutshell, positive self talk, coupled with the ability to truly forgive others can lead to great things.	2004-07-18

This book puts forth a tremendously powerful approach to dealing with interpersonal, as well as international, problems.  The Buddhist teachings on compassion are numerous and complex.  However, this book provides a clear discussion of the benefits of compassion and the use of specific meditation techniques to foster it.  It seems that these teachings integrate well with Christian, Islamic and other religious frameworks.  If more religious fundamentalists took these teachings to heart, terrorism would wither and die of neglect.	2004-07-18

Actually, I don't know where you could look, in light of the times.  In any event, this is a funny, light and easy to read book that examines hot zones aroung the world with a lighter perspective.  Oddly enough, the author makes quite a few valid points about the foundational aspects of conflict around the world.  As Americans, it would be good for us to learn that we can't solve the world's problems with the fast-food approach that we find so satisfying to apply to other aspects of life.  I especially enjoyed Mr. O'Rourke's descriptions of his interaction with common people in the Middle East, since it drives home the fact that most people just want to be left alone to make a decent living; without much regard for the politics of hatred that our leaders tend to focus upon.	2004-07-18

My personal favorite is &quot;Telepsychics,&quot; but this book is a nice introduction to the benefits of controlling your own thought patterns.  In today's society, everyone has ample opportunity to consider themselves victimized in some way.  If you are tired of these types of defeatist thought patterns, read this book to learn a new way.  Although the author utilizes many Biblical references, this is not a book that is exclusively for Christians.  This philosophy is extremely inclusive.  My only complaint is that some of the material is naturally a bit dated, since the book was originally published 40 years ago.	2004-07-17

This book goes into great detail on everything from types of alarm sensors to how locks are picked.  I wouldn't advise reading this book straight through; you would be better served to use it as a resource to explore specific areas of interest.  I think the most useful chapter is the one that covers how burglars break into homes.  It covers the bad guy's tactics and what you can do to thwart them.  This chapter alone is worth the price of the book and I personally found it very useful in making decisions in the construction of my home security system.	2004-05-31

Some of these ideas make appearances in popular self-help books from time to time, but no one can match the force of the entire work.

Some of the statements the author makes are along the lines of; &quot;I've heard that machines can be programmed to give better hands to lower bets.&quot;  These make for interesting anecdotes, but not much in terms of substance.  However, the author provides good information for introductory strategy that will definitely save the novice player money.  In a book of this nature, I think it is essential that there be information on which machines are statistically full-pay machines and which are not.  For instance, if a jacks or better machine pays 9 to 1 for a full house and 6 to 1 for a flush, perfect play over the long run will yield close to full paybacks, while a machine that pays 8 and 5 to 1 respectively, is only a 94% payback machine.  This information is critical if you want to play for very long, but isn't found in this book.	2004-05-19

Other books by this author focus more on the attainment of material wealth.  Dr. Murphy had some innovative ideas on the symbolism contained in the Bible and quotes many scriptures.  However, he is not exclusive of other creeds and has a more Universalist perspective than is common in philosophical works these days.

The author uses theories of applied kinesiology to develop a philosophical framework which develops a heirarchy of emotional states that reflect varying degrees of truth or goodness based upon muscular responses to various substances or agents.  The basic theory is that we are all attached to a universal consciousness which knows what is good for us and what isn't.  As such, muscle response will be strong when the subject is exposed to classical music and weak when exposed to rap music.  The book has interesting things to say about what emotions can do to build you up or pull you down.  I have to take exception with some reviewers' fixation with this book's references to Wal-Mart as an example of a business that operates on a higher spiritual level.  Yes, the book does talk about Wal-Mart for a couple of pages as an example of an enlightened business model.  However, at the time the book was written, Wal-Mart was personally run by Sam Walton and was not the small-town crushing behemoth that it is today.  Praise of Wal-Mart is NOT a major portion of this book.  I haven't had the chance to personally verify the methodology myself, but the conclusions of the book are hard to dispute.	2004-04-20

The author used hypnosis to guide her patients through past life regressions all the way to the beginning of time.  The various descriptions are basically congruent, but they are tough to validate in any meaningful sense.  Having said this, I enjoyed this book because it offers an alternative viewpoint of Creation from that which I learned in the Lutheran Church.  The final chapter, which offers advice on lifestyle changes that can enhance spirituality was quite interesting and I wish it were expanded. In short, the book tackles a subject that hasn't been adequately addressed in a creative and inspirational manner.	2004-04-16

Although first published in 1973, Telepsychics is a wonderful classic in this field that can change your life.  Although written with many Biblical references, this is a book for all spiritual paths.  Dr. Murphy doesn't preach or seek to exclude anyone.  He simply lays the foundation for self-improvement through the scientific use of prayer concepts as a means of tapping your subconscious powers.  The techniques that the author advocates probably aren't like the way you were taught to pray in church, but it seems to me that they are more effective than anything I've ever experienced.

I really enjoyed this book, which contains the poetic musings of our current Secretary of Defense.  Portions of his speeches, interviews and press confereces are placed, verbatim, within the structure of sonnets, haikus and other poetic devices.  The results are often hilarious.  My only complaint is that sometimes, there isn't a meaningful mention of the context in which the words were spoken.

The author dispels many common myths and provides a good historical overview.  The portions of the book on self-hypnosis probably aren't comprehensive enough to allow for mastery, but they are certainly a good beginning.

I thought the chapters on body image and aging were excellent.  My only complaint is that the section on business ethics is somewhat dated.  The book trumpets the success of the Levi Strauss Company as an example of attitudinal healing in practice.

It was difficult for me to read more than a chapter or so of this book at one sitting.  The reports of corruption and influence peddling are extremely difficult to read without getting very angry at the system and our elected officials and corporate CEOs who are determined to exploit the entire planet.  With his background in journalism, Greg Palast is able to write in an extremely lucid fashion and the book seems to be well-researched, in spite of what some of the other right-wing reviewers have said.  Sometimes, the truth hurts.  I think one of the best attributes of the book is that the author lays out a number of problems, but then devotes a few pages at the end to things the reader can do to address those problems.  If you are disinclined to buy the company line from our government or big business, this book is for you.	2004-02-23

The book is broken down into chapters on Wealth, Health, and Relationships among others.  There are good examples of affirmations in each chapter, but I think that it is best to customize your own affirmations, using the examples in the book as guidelines.  Although controlling your own thoughts through the use of affirmations is a central principle in this book, there is also some good information here with respect to the impact of negative thoughts as well.  The book makes good use of real-life examples which serve to illustrate the central principles.  I have read many works on positive thinking and the use of affirmations, but this is one of the best since it explains the flip-side of negativity and unforgiveness that can sabotage your efforts to improve yourself.  This aspect sets the book apart from the others.  It is also a very smooth and readable resource that goes by quickly, unlike others that can be a struggle to finish.	2004-01-19

This book provides great insight into investment bubbles and the madness of crowds.  My only complaint is that the subtitle, &quot;Surviving the Soft Depression of the 21st Century,&quot; is somewhat misleading. There isn't much investment advice to be found here, other than &quot;Sell the DOW and buy GOLD.&quot;  This is excellent advice as far as it goes, but in this book it doesn't go much farther.  Having said this, I think the author does a great job of drawing parallels between the Japanese economy of 1989 and the U.S. economy of 1999.  There are compelling arguments to be made that our economy is destined to decline in much the same way that Japan's did ten years earlier, but in greater magnitudes. I also enjoyed the political discussions about democracy and freedom, and how the first doesn't necessarily guarantee the second.  The fact that the author is also a copywriter, makes the book a pretty easy read.	2004-01-03

Some of the statements just end a little too abruptly.  This small issue aside, I think this book is a good introduction to manifesting the things that you want out of life.  By following the guidelines that are set forth and tailoring the process to your own personality, you can make substantive improvements to every aspect of your life from the interpersonal to the financial.  Since I tend to struggle with lingering doubt, it's best for me to start small.  A generally positive person would be able to start with larger requests. The instructions are clear and manageable.	2003-12-17

The author provides several affirmations and a framework for developing your own personal affirmations based upon what you want to accomplish.  I finished the book 2 weeks ago and haven't had any earth shattering experiences, but I have felt a higher sense of well-being.  Although the book can be finished quickly, it's format is such that you can pick it up later and find something useful.  I wrote some of the affirmations on 3x5 cards that I use as bookmarks, just to remind me to stay positive.	2003-12-17

From the outset, King states that this book shouldn't be read as a stand alone volume and that you should read volumes 1 through 4 before tackling \\"The Wolves of Calla.\\"  The only thing I can say is; \\"Amen to that!\\"  I read the first 4 volumes over the course of about a year, finishing the 4th installment about 2 or maybe 3 years ago.  I've read the first hundred pages of this book and I've decided to go back and read 1 through 4 again before proceeding.  Maybe I'm slipping into early senility, but there is simply too much backstory to sort through without having it fresh in your mind.  Even with this problem, I'm giving the book 4 stars, because it is starting out nicely, personal memory problems aside.  I will edit my review after I backtrack through the series in order.  By that time, I'm sure the final volumes will already be in print.	2003-12-01

When I ordered this book from Amazon, I received no less than 3 backorder notices before it arrived, but it was worth the wait.  The tragic story of the publication of this book is interesting in itself, involving corporate cowardice on the part of the publisher and brazen political bullying on the part of the Bush Campaign.  Kudos to Soft Skull Press for having the courage to publish a stunning indictment of the Post-911 Tyrant who bought his way into the White House.  This is a textbook in political corruption and influence peddling that is well-researched and completely substantiated.  Any coke addict born with a silver spoon in his mouth should take heart at the success of Dubya.	2003-11-27

My only complaint (a very small one) is that the book is probably more targeted to a female audience with several references to finding a husband or handling children.  As a man, I found most of the exercises too introspective for my taste.  Primitive that I am, I don't like to recollect big mistakes that I have made or probe deeply into my own psyche.  I guess I'm just not wired that way.  These small issues aside.  I thought the book was fun to read and worthwhile.  I probably enjoyed Dr. Wiseman's &quot;The Luck Factor,&quot; a little more.	2003-11-24

I read this book while I was searching for answers to an unfulfilling legal career and it helped to motivate me to leave a firm that I hated and open my own practice with 2 friends.  You can read this book in fifteen minutes, but the ideas will stay with you.  Generally, each page contains a sentence or two dealing with a progression of thought about the meaning of life and finding your calling.  Each page also contains a humorous animal photograph that illustrates the point of the text on that page.  In a way, a book about philosophy that is short and to the point like this one can be more useful than a lengthy, more developed presentation.	2003-11-15

Don't expect much in the way of introspective philosophy if you buy this book.  Phil Esposito played the game because he loved the game and loved having fun...end of story.  In any event, this book is a fun and fast paced page-turner.  Espo dishes the dirt on everyone, but doesn't gloss over his own faults and problems.  If you want to know how hockey has developed into the game it is today, read this book.  My only complaint is that I don't think the co-author did much to address transitions between the different stories and, thus, the finished product here is a bit rough and appears somewhat disorganized, even though the events are basically recounted in chronological order.	2003-11-14

Wayne Dyer is a talented writer and this is a worthy subject, but the principles that he discusses can't be put into practice overnight unless you already have the spiritual strengths of the Dalai Lama.  However, if you focus on taking the small steps that are outlined first (such as developing a daily meditation practice), I think that this book can be quite helpful.  There are also good chapters addressing issues such as Forgiveness and Dealing with Anger.  The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars, was the fact that the book isn't a real page-turner and it was difficult to keep my interest high enough to keep reading.  As such, it took me a couple of weeks of night-time reading to complete.	2003-11-14

After 3 weeks, I lost around 15 pounds, but I really didn't feel right.  I was really tired while I was on the plan.  In addition, my thought process seemed to become sluggish.  Ultimately, I quit the plan and am feeling much better.  I think this plan is great if you just want to shed a few pounds, but like any other diet it is HARD to stay with.  To me, meals just didn't seem to be complete without having bread.  The recipes and the meal plan itself sound good, but if you don't have a personal chef, they are time-consuming and a bit unrealistic.	2003-11-13

Even if you don't buy that inductive leap, Icke does an excellent job of exposing the ties that bind the Bush Family, the Rockefellers, Henry Kissinger and the British Royal Family together (just to name a few).  The only thing that stopped me from giving this book 5 stars is what I view to be an annoying tendecy for Icke to rehash some of the same info from his previous books.  This detriment only comes into play, of course, if you have read his other works.  In any event, the book is compelling, even if you just believe ten percent of it.  It is a very enjoyable work.	2003-09-27

The author does an excellent job of exposing the devastating socio-economic impacts of corporate farming.  However, he doesn't sink to the level of political diatribe.  He examines his subject through the eyes of people that the reader can identify with and care about.  As an aside, being from Pueblo, Colorado, I was intrigued to discover that a large portion of this book centers on people in and around Colorado Springs.	2003-09-21

However, it seems like you could read the chapters in any order you wished and still end up in the same place.  Along similar lines, I guess my only complaint is that the book gives you enough information on a subject so that you become really interested (Occult Elements of the Son Of Sam shootings, for instance) and then simply moves on to something else.  I think if the book were 100 pages longer, I would have given it 5 stars.  Having said that, I should note that Mr. Hoffman has a rare gift for utilizing the English language and I enjoyed this book.	2003-09-04

If just a portion of the allegations in this book are true, you might as well throw out every &quot;history&quot; book in your library.  Although I liked the author's &quot;Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster,&quot; better, this book is impressive in scope and represents a mind-expanding experience.  The author's basic premise is that a race of reptilian extraterrestrials has controlled the course of human events for thousands of years and continues to do so to this day.  Many of the statements made in the book are objectively verifiable, but inductive leaps are made that are certainly a stretch.  The chapter on the death of Princess Diana is probably the most interesting in the entire book and raises the prospect that she was ritually assassinated by The Brotherhood.	2003-08-31

I've never been much of a conspiracy theory supporter, but this book opened my eyes to several issues regarding 9-11 that I hadn't really noticed before.  This is a very controversial subject and the author does a great job of presenting evidence that our government may have known about the attacks in advance, or maybe even had a role in them.  If you have an open mind and follow the book through to its conclusion, you will at least have another perspective on the current &quot;War on Terrorism.&quot;  The book is extensively footnoted and many of the author's conclusions are hard to believe, but plausible.	2003-08-07

Within the context of examining a grisly murder, it presents an unvarnished overview of the history of the Latter Day Saints, incorporating both the good and the bad.  One can't help but be sympathetic to the persecution the Mormons have endured, especially prior to their settlement in Utah.  However, one is equally taken aback by the apparent bloodlust of the early church leaders and fundamentalist adherents of today.  The book also details the current state of polygamy in North America along with the sexual abuse of young girls that is rampant in communities where polygamy is practiced without much in the way of challenge by state or federal authorities.  The book is well-written, well-researched and entertaining.	2003-08-02

It is a startling expose' on the manner in which our government has sold out the interests of the nation in exchange for big $$$$.  Although I am a conservative by nature, I found the details about the relationship between the Bush Administrations and the Saudi Royal Family to be appalling.  This book details those relationships as well as the historical framework behind the current state of affairs in the Middle East.  The fact that our national economy could be brought to its knees in a single coordinated terrorist assault on the Saudi oil fields is absolutely chilling.

The Mystery of Capital posits the theory that development of capitalist economies is a function of the ability to accurately record and protect the private ownership of property as a means of allowing that property to function as capital.  Once the nature of ownership passes beyond just the realm of physical possession, property can be synthesized into non-physical forms that can be sold, rented or borrowed against to generate more economic activity.  The problem in Developing Nations isn't a lack of property, but rather an inability to convert property into its most productive uses.  The author includes numerous statistics to substantiate his hypothesis, but not so many that your eyes glaze over.	2003-07-19

If you are looking for tabulations of double-blind studies on luck, this isn't the book for you.

The premise of this work rests on the idea that voting is simply a way of oppressing those who are disenfranchised either by circumstance or by choice.

Rogers blames government corruption for most of the problems in the world and views anti-American sentiment as the product of our idiotic governmental policies that alienate everyone.

The author's advice with respect to issues of sexuality would be frightening to most parents.	2002-03-18

Some of the techniques are workable if you have a high tolerance for risk, but I would not recommend this book from a legal standpoint.	2002-03-18

Bernard Goldberg simply and eloquently demonstrates the fact that the liberal slant in network news and other mainstream media outlets is a direct result of the complete detachment of the press corps from everyday American existence.  All of these people are from the same areas, went to the same schools and share the same political views. Is it any wonder why they put the same spin on the nightly news?  The book is well written and puts forward an interesting premise that is hard to dispute.	2002-03-17

Thomas has written an easy-to-follow, yet useful resource for the beginning investor in real estate.  While other works may be more comprehensive in scope, they can also be more confusing and less helpful, in that they tend to give the reader too many choices.  &quot;Rental Houses,&quot; provides great advice without the usual pie-in-the-sky that is common in this genre.  If I had to select one book as an introduction to rental properties, this would be it.	2002-03-17
