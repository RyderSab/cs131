You'd have to be a hermit so as not to see one of his books at a bookstore, corner drug store or your supermarket. It was nothing personal, I just never had the desire to read his stuff. <br /> <br />Then I picked this one up. It was on a whim. I wanted to read a fun and entertaining book. Well, I got what I wished for. The plot of the book is like the title. It races along at an almost breathless pace. Six hours after picking it up, I was nearly done. It's a quick easy read. The plot is one of sheer momentum and the characters are solid and believable. <br /> <br />I won't give away the plot. A lot of reviewers have done that here already and I'd simply rehash what they've so eloquently stated. Needless to say, if you're a long time Koontz fan, I'm sure you'll love this one. If you're a newbie like me, you'll be instantly hooked and thirsty for more. <br /> <br />Bravo Mr. Koontz. <br /> <br />Signed,  <br /> <br />A New Fan.	2005-07-17

His specialty was fighting the Soviet partisans which operated behind the German lines. After the war, he and some comrades escaped into France and joined the Foreign Legion where they were eventually sent to Indochina to combat the escallating war there. As they spoke into the night, Elford asked the man if he would tape his story, the man obliged with the proviso that his real identity would not be revealed. Elford agreed. Four years later, Devil's Guard was published. <br /> <br />In the thirty plus years since it's publication, this book has been surrounded by myth, hype and Lord knows what else. It has been denounced as neo-Nazi text and a manual for professional military men in fighting insurgency among other things. Others have disputed it's authenticity. <br /> <br />I will say this though; it's one heck of a read. If you've read this book, then you already know. If you haven't, well, let's just say that you don't pick this book up, you unholster it like you would a weapon. <br /> <br />It's got enough action in it to satisfy the most bloodthirsty reader. But it isn't all action. There's enough off battlefield incidents to save the book from being a third rate actioner. Yes, there are some sentiments uttered from the narrator (not Elford, but the SS man) that might be unsettling (none of it antisemitic), but one can say he stands by his convictions. <br /> <br />If you should spot a copy for cheap, don't think twice, just get it. You won't be sorry.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-06

Published in 1976 when Conroy was 30, The Great Santini marked the debut of a talented writer and born storyteller. <br />To those who are well acquainted with Conroy, this novel (like all his others) is autobiographical in content. This is the story of Lt. Col. Bull Meecham, United States Marine Corps fighter pilot and his family. Meecham runs his family like a squadron. His word is law and he is the ultimate authority. Any family who dare dissents from Bull's view will suffer his wrath. The novel is, at the core, a family story. Bull, his lovely wife Lillian and their four children, Ben the oldest, Mary Ann, Karen and young Matt. Ben feels all the pressure as the Colonel pushes his son to be the best and will not tolerate any backtalk. <br />The story moves along at a fine pace and the characters are fully developed whether they are the main characters or supporting ones. <br />It is interesting to note that it is Conroy's only novel that was written in the third person, and, unlike other first novels, it does not suffer from the standard problems that usually go with debuts. <br />The one thing that impresses me the most is that Conroy's Marine Corps scenes ring with absolute authority. A difficult achievment for a writer who didn't serve in the Corps. No doubt he had witnessed much Marine Corps activity when going to bases in the company of his father (Col. Don Conroy, USMC Ret. dec.). <br />Pick this book up if you can. It's a genuine slice of life book that both entertains and enlarges your view of the world.	2005-04-11

Despite it's brevity, author John Irwin has penned one of the best WWII memoirs I have ever read. He's honest, humorous, and pulls no punches. He was only in combat for a brief period (March-April 1945). In this time, the Rhine had been crossed and the German forces were rapidly disintegrating. Still, it was no picnic as some WWII histories try to paint. There were always some Germans trying to destroy a tank with one of their vaunted Panzerfausts. Plus, one can say honestly that in combat, time takes on a different meaning. This book in a ideal read for World War II buffs of all ages. Enthusiastically recommended!	2005-01-31

Yes, there are similarities, but there are differences too. <br /> <br />In The Gunslinger we meet Roland, but Drawing of the Three introduces us to others who are fated to accompany him and his quest for the mysterious Dark Tower. This is where the story (and King) finds its voice. If Gunslinger has some slow spots, this one has a much stronger narrative. The pace is swifter and you find yourself turning the pages furiously to see what happens next. I read 180 pages in one evening, I was so hooked. <br /> <br />This was a fun book. I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to the further adventures of Roland and his Ka-Tet.	2004-11-16

(Confessions of a New DT Junkie)	I found a copy of this book at a local thrift shop. I plopped down my thirty-seven cents, opened it to the first page and damnit if King didn't get me! <br /> <br />Now here I am, I have all seven books (I even have the Donald Grant Artist editions of the last three books) and I'm hopelessly addicted to Roland Deschain and the wonders of Mid-World.  <br /> <br />I have to new edition of the Gunslinger and I do intend of reading it some day (but not until I finish all seven) and I do think that the first version definitely had some slow parts to it. But when King gets to the action, strap yourself in and hold on tight! <br /> <br />Originally, I thought the idea of a pseudo-western set on another world ludicrous. But once again, I underestimated King's skills as a storyteller and writer. I will not make the same mistake again. <br /> <br />His imagination propels Roland on his mysterious quest. If you've read the Gunslinger, then  you already know. But if you haven't embarked on the journey, I strongly urge you do so. I'm sure you won't regret it.	2004-11-16

It's dated in many ways (something that King himself acknowledges in the new introduction), but in the end it's still a fine, gripping read.    There are no weepy self loathing vampires here (ne-Anne Rice). But rather, King's vampires are vicious, evil predators with an insatiable appetite for blood and are willing to stop at nothing to slake their thirst.     I think the greatest thing King does to make the atmosphere even spookier is that Barlow is only used in a handful of scenes. A wise move. By doing this, he makes Barlow a truly frightening character with a terrifying malevolence that dominates the novel. Had he been in more scenes, I don't think he would be as menacing (don't believe me? Then let me ask you this: Is Dr. Lecter more frightening in Silence of the Lambs or Hannibal?) In short, Kurt Barlow is one of the greatest vampire characters ever created.    I enjoyed the novel very much. It didn't scare me (very little does these days), but it's a taut, well written thriller. If you like vampire stories with no BS then this is the book for you.	2004-11-13

I snorted like an elitist when I heard he was working on this book. How can a man who writes so much really CARE about his craft, I wondered.<br />Boy, was I wrong. I have looked at myriads of books about writing and this is, by all odds, the best ever done. A blurb on the back of the book said, &quot;This is the best book on writing. Ever.&quot; <br />I find it hard to disagree with that. King speaks to the reader his enthusiasm and care for the language. He also uses superb examples of writing both positive and negative to wonderful effect.<br />If you desire to write fiction (regardless of genre) then this book should be mandatory. It's clear, fun and highly motivational. If this doesn't make you want to pick up a pen or run to your word processor, then there's something wrong with you!<br />Oh, by the way, this is the first book of Mr. King that I ever read. I intend on reading others.<br />Enjoy.	2004-04-24

This is the best combat novel of World War II infantry ever written. The second of an autobiographical trilogy planned by Jones (with &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; being the first, and &quot;Whistle&quot; planned to finish the storyline) it covers the shortest span of time, and it is also the shortest. But it is probably the most intense and I think, the most gripping. Avoid Terrence Malick's cinematic version which I think missed Jones' vision by a mile.<br />In this novel, we see &quot;C for Charlie&quot; company's struggle for some fictional territory on Guadalcanal in late 1942. It carries some of the most intense sequences of infantry combat ever committed to paper (one of the most harrowing is the company clerk, Bead and his run-in with a roving Japanese soldier while attempting to relieve himself is particularly effecting to make it all the more remarkable, it's based on Jones' own personal experience). <br />I can't recommend this masterpiece highly enough. Jones has captured for all time, the sights and smells of infantry combat better than anyone before or since. Read it. You won't be disappointed.	2004-01-24

First off, let's dismiss the &quot;Untold Story&quot; bit which is part of the book's title. The fact is that the 10th Mountain has received its share of books and &quot;Climb to Conquer&quot; in that respect, is no different.<br />That said, along with McKay Jenkins &quot;The Last Ridge&quot; and Bob Bishop's and Flint Whitlock's &quot;Soldiers on Skis&quot; you have what I think is a wonderful tryptych on America's Mountain Soldiers.<br />&quot;Climb to Conquer&quot; compares favorably with &quot;Last Ridge.&quot; Shelton's book is I think, a touch more readable. Shelton moves the action along quickly. The photo section isn't as good as &quot;Last Ridge&quot; (though neither can compare to &quot;Soldiers on Skis&quot; for that matter). The book also suffers for lack of maps. Shelton does a wonderful job describing the 10th's objectives and obstacles and how they overcome them, but some maps would help keep readers abreast of what is going on.<br />&quot;The Last Ridge&quot; is, I think more conforming of a straight narrative historical account and &quot;Climb to Conquer&quot; is written much like a catchy magazine article (but in this case, it's a good thing).<br />Each book has it's strengths. Jenkins' book is highly informative, but Shelton's will probably read faster. Both are warmly recommended. I can't pick out which is better. That is best left to the readers. However, it's nice to see America's Mountain troops get the recognition they long deserve.<br />Grant Waara	2003-11-08

The brainchild of &quot;Minnie&quot; Dole (no relation to later 10th Member and future senator Robert Dole) who struggled against the stodgy Army bureaucracy before gaining General Marshall's ear. Marshall, seeing that mountain troops were being used by all the belligerent armies, decided that a Mountain unit would be useful to the U.S. Army. So the 87th Mountain Regiment was born. Later, the 85th and 86th Regiments were added and thus, the 10th Mountain Division was born. After over two years of rigorous training, they finally saw action in Italy in 1945. Passed over by Ike's Chief of Staff Walter Bedell Smith, Mark Clark, the commander of the Allied field armies in Italy snapped up the 10th. It was one of his greatest moves.<br />The 10th, in a series of daring maneuvers and risky night climbing seized enemy held ridges and finished 114 days in combat suffering higher casualty percentages than other divisions.<br />Jenkins' book views the 10th's actions from both the high command and the soldiers who did the fighting. He mainly sticks to the fighting men for most of the book. Minor errors creep into the text. General Truscott's first name was Lucian, not Lucien and it's General Walter Bedell Smith, not just Bedell.<br />Still, it's a solid, fast moving story and a first rate war adventure.

Geoffrey Perret has taken on a daunting task to tell the United States Army's massive and pivotal role in World War II and somehow against all odds, he succeeds.<br />His stories on how the Army developed its tactical doctrine, how the weapons like the M-1 and the Bazooka were created and adapted into the Army's arsenal are well written and seem like the stuff of fiction and are as interesting as the accounts of the campaigns.<br />I did not find myself agreeing with all of his conclusions (particularly when it regards the Marines), but that's the sign of a good historian. <br />Other information abounds in the book. What happened to battlefield casualties (both wounded and dead), what happens to POWs, how medals were distributed, how the Army developed it's dreaded artillery fire method, how C-rations were created. In fact, I can't really think of anything that Perret didn't cover.<br />I disagree with the reviewer who said the book was &quot;spin.&quot; It's the superior force makes the enemy fight on his terms, not on those of the opponent. The fact stands that time and time again, the U.S. Army forced its German and Japanese enemies to fight on its choosing, not theirs.<br />My only gripe about the book is the notes. They are lumped into the back of the book and there isn't a bibliography. Had these been added, I think that it would have made a great book even better.<br />I will let Perret conclude for me:  <br />&quot;The German Army of World War II has many admirers and defenders. 'No one has ever met them on their terms ever defeated them' is how Eric Larrabee, who fought in North Africa puts it. Larrabee is absolutely right. At the same time, it is equally true that no one who met the U.S. Army of World War II on ITS terms ever defeated it either.&quot;	2003-10-19

Since the passing of the late Stephen Ambrose, Carlo D'Este has probably assumed the mantle of America's leading World War II historian and author. This work was his fourth dealing with military events in the European theater (and in this case, the third dealing with the Mediterranean). You probably won't find a better, more detailed account of the Anzio battle than in this book. It's well researched, very detailed and a quick moving read.<BR>I gathered that D'Este believed that the Allies weren't all that allied and the Germans, outnumbered and outsupplied, simply took advantage of Allied mistakes and blunders and nearly made &quot;Operation Shingle&quot; a total disaster.<BR>D'Este clearly admires Mark Clark's bravery, but questions his strategic abilities. He finds Alexander personally likeable, but one of the least decisive theater commanders of the war and Kesselring, daring, resourceful and opportunistic. The General he admires most is without a doubt, Lucian K. Truscott Jr, first commander of the famous U. S. Third Infantry Division, then is elevated to 6th Corps command when Lucas is relieved. The way the author marshalls his facts, you will find it hard to disagree.<BR>But to me, the hero of the book is the ordinary land soldier, the men who endured the barbarous fighting, the nightmarish stalemate and the eventual breakout of the beachhead. This is a superb piece of military history and well worth the time it will take to read it.	2003-09-27

To start off with, the author's real name is: Asa Earl Carter. Carter was known to be a racist. He was with George Wallace and left him when Wallace began to change his views. He wrote \\"Outlaw Josey Wales\\" (It's first title was: 'The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales,\\") and was printed by an obscure publisher in Alabama. He sent a copy to Clint Eastwood, hoping that he might be interested in securing the film rights. What happened was that producer Robert Daley got it instead and then one weekend, having nothing to read, he saw Carter's book and decided to read it. He read it in one sitting. Then Eastwood read it. They met Carter to negotiate the rights. Carter showed up to the meeting drunk.<br />Despite Carter's myriad of character flaws, this can be certainly said: the man could write. \\"Outlaw Josey Wales\\" is one of the best westerns I've ever read. It's a fast moving tale, packed with action and incident. The movie follows the story quite faithfully (though the timeline is compressed) and Eastwood made at least my favorite of all of his westerns (yes, I think it's better than \\"Unforgiven).<br />Back to the book. I can't speak for the politics of the book. Yes, if you're aren't a fan of big government, I suppose this book will speak to you. But if you've ever lost all that mattered to you, if you've been left with nothing, then this book will speak to you. That's where the book's genius truly lies. It struck a universal note, not just some political rambling. That's why I think Mr. Daley and Eastwood were so taken with it. When the book begins, Josey has nothing to live for and thus lives a life of vengeance; but as the book ends, he truly has something to live for, and he sees how hollow vengeance truly is.<br />A great western. A great book.<br />How the heck did Carter do it?	2003-09-10

The movie that was based on this is altogether a different creature, yet both are enjoyable. Stachel realizes his shortcomings in the film, yet is carried away by all the glory that is swept over him. In the novel, Stachel is a full time passenger on the low self esteem bandwagon and his winning the Blue Max seems not to change him a wit. Only near the end does he seem to glimpse hope, yet all runs afoul due to his own selfishness.<br />The aerial action scenes are good (though I had a problem with one scene where Stachel and Von Klugermann are jumped by five SPADS, Stachel is flying a Pfalz {a sluggish aircraft at best}, and Von Klugermann, an Albatros, but during the melee, they shoot down three, yet they seem to suffer nary a scratch which I'm sorry seems unlikely, one of them would have been brought down or at the very least, shot up), and there's plenty of them. Sometimes I get the feeling that Mr. Hunter held the RAF in low esteem, but that's just me being analytical. His characterizations are first rate, and the novel moves along briskly.  His observations into alcoholism are fantastic. His description of Stachel's need for alcohol and the release he believes that it gives is harrowing.<br />A good read.	2003-07-22

It's been nearly five years since I've read &quot;Into Thin Air,&quot; but Krakauer's book is the kind that remains with you long after you've closed it. This book is probably one the author himself wishes he had never had to write. I'm sure he wished that he could have written a different one, one that is to say, where there are no deaths, one where everyone successfully completes their ascents to Everest's peak. However as we all know things didn't go that way. Instead, bad luck and death hounded them and Krakauer, one of the lucky few to survive managed to tell us his side of the story. It's elegantly written, cleanly reported and above all, haunting. <BR>I usually don't read books on the outdoors, but this one was clearly worth it. I think it will long remain an adventure classic.	2003-07-20

In the 1950's and 60's, Japanese memoirs of the Pacific War flooded forth from the publishers. Saburo Sakai's \\"Samurai\\", Hara's \\"Japanese Destroyer Captain,\\" Mochitsura Hashimoto's \\"Sunk!\\" are just the tip of the spear. But Yoshida's \\"Requiem for Battleship Yamato\\" is simply in a class by itself. The youngest officer on board the mighty battleship, he was present when the giant was ordered on her suicide sortie. Escorted by the anti-aircraft cruiser Yahagi and numerous destroyers in April 1945, Yamato's mission was sublimely ridiculous: sail down toward the Ryuku Islands (where a massive American task force was staging the invasion of Okinawa), attack the landing force, beach itself, expend all weapons and ammunition, then the surviving crew members would join the garrison in Okinawa's defense. It was no surprise that the force didn't even make it halfway before being annihilated by U.S. planes. Yoshida's book is poetic and is beautifully translated by Richard Minnear who also provides a superb introduction as well. Yoshida's account of the American air attacks which inevitably shattered the Yamato, the Yahagi and most of the escorting destroyers come off as not combat, but high slaughter. Veterans who survived idiotic orders and suicide charges will find a spiritual brother in Yoshida. Don't be surprised if you have a tear in your eye for the brave crews of these ships as you close this book for the last time.<br />Written as a tribute to his shipmates, \\"Requiem\\" is also a powerful anti-war book.	2003-07-19

Lamb asked what his next book was going to be, and Ambrose didn't hold back and said that he was working on a biography of Meriwether Lewis. &quot;Oh, wait'll you read my Meriwether Lewis book,&quot; he said. I hardly knew of the L&amp;C expedition, but his hook worked. I knew that I was going to read it when it came out. When it did come out, I grabbed a first edition. And if you care to know, this was the first Ambrose book I ever read.<br />I don't profess to know much about the great expedition, but this book was a genuine eye opener. I learned so much about the expedition, Lewis and Clark, Thomas Jefferson, I devoured it in a few days' time.<br />If you're like me and don't know much about the subject, this is the book for you. You'll come away not only informed, but entertained as well.<br />I personally believe that this is Ambrose's last great work. His other books published afterwards were good, but they weren't as sharp or, as Michael Beschloss said on the jacket blurb, as &quot;lyrical&quot; as this.<br />Will someone PLEASE make a movie of this? It demands it!	2003-07-06

First off, let's say that any book that is using Richard Cole and Pamela Des Barres as actual SOURCES, well pardon the pun, but it makes me wonder....<br />Anyway, this is a fun book. Make my review three and a half stars. The pluses, it's well written and the story chugs along with the pace of &quot;Communication Breakdown.&quot; The negatives? Well, Cole and Des Barres (both &quot;wrote&quot; their own books later) to begin with and Davis's Bibliography is thin. But then again, Led Zeppelin's relationship with the media were like the Korean DMZ. Rarely did the two peacefully co-exist, so you can't blame the author for thin reference sources.<br />I've read this book three times, it's admittedly my favorite Rock Bio, but I certainly recognize its flaws. But the thing that I admire most is that Davis never forgets Zeppelin's music. One can see that he so obviously loves their music and admires their musicianship and prowess, it's just that he is less enamored with their personal conduct.<br />It's been almost 20 years since it's publication and it is still the best Zep bio by all odds.	2003-06-02

I was in Kilo Company, 3/7 (3rd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment for those not in the know), some five years before the events experienced by Mr. Swofford. I also knew some of the guys in our own Battalion's STA platoon. While I don't know anything of their indoctrination, their training regiment or what else, it seemed to me like they spent a lot of time on working parties or just plain skating their way through their enlistments.<br />Gulf War memoirs are beginning to pour forth from publishers. I wonder about the timing sometimes, but it wouldn't surprise me that Swofford's slim volume is the best of the lot. Like James Webb's classic \\"Fields of Fire\\" Swofford catches the lingo of Marines perfectly, but he also discusses the ups and the many downs of being one of the Few and the Proud (sometimes I felt like pride had little to anything to do with my own enlistment). I don't necessarily agree with whomever wrote the dust jacket in comparing this book to Caputo's \\"A Rumor of War\\" or \\"The Things They Carried,\\" by Tim O'Brien. \\"A Rumor of War\\" is still probably the best Vietnam memoir out there, and Caputo's experiences are as far from Mr. Swofford's as they get. Tim O'Brien's book is a work of fiction, something \\"Jarhead\\" is not. If they tried to compare it to say, \\"If I Die in a Combat Zone,\\" I feel that would have been more appropriate.<br />Swofford's book entails his peacetime experience as well as the Gulf War. He shows how his fellow Marines wage war on each other long before the Iraqis intrude. The deployment (\\"Desert Shield\\") is a long and monotonous one, and despite some brief but terrifying moments, 2/7 STA platoon's war is frustratingly short. These men have spent years readying themselves for this moment and the war ends before they really experience it. The end feeling is one of curiosity and frustration. Swofford is wonderful in describing the almost Dantesque Kuwaiti landscape that is littered with shatteredIraqi Army vehicles, and dead Iraqi soldiers.<br />I found myself seeing my own experience in reading Swofford's chronicle. It's well written, humorous (the deepest most black sense of humor pervades this narrative) and moves briskly. In the tradition of other Marine memoirists like William Manchester and Lewis B. Puller Jr., Swofford seems to be highly ambivalent about his service. No doubt he, like the others previously mentioned (as well as myself) could tear the Corps a new one up and down, for their pettiness, for their abuses, for their ridiculous obssession with small details, but to hear an outsider try to do the same thing only invites annoyance and scorn.<br />Jarhead is a good read. I hope Mr. Swofford's novel will deliver more on the excellent promise his memoir affords us.<br />Semper Fi, Mr. Swofford...	2003-03-15

Here, in just over 200 pages, he paints a highly evocative picture of the British Tommy slugging his way through Burma and to victory in 1945. His memory he admits, has its gaps. He recalls meeting General Slim, the famed commander of the 14th Army, but cannot recall the day. He can't remember what he was doing on V-J day. But he recalls details, but not the dates of them; a 15 inch centipede in his tent, when his canoe floundered on the Sittang, when Nine section captured its first Japanese POW, he definitely remembers a section member taking the man's watch. <BR>These are probably fallible memories, but it's their honesty that makes Fraser human, and it's what makes this memoir worth reading.<br />Fraser has captured the enlisted man's war in Burma for all time. It would be nice to see an 8th Army veteran recall the Desert War.<br />Fraser also like Audie Murphy's &quot;To Hell and Back&quot; uses a great deal of dialogue in catching the eccentrities of the Cumbrian borderers of his section. He changes their names (Murphy did too) something common in war memoirs. However, American readers might stumble over what the men are saying, but while GMF admits that it's not an exact reconstruction of what was spoken, &quot;most of it {the dialogue) obviously is not...it is entirely faithful in gist, subject and style.&quot; This is of course, true, but one feels that GMF caught the higher truth of what life was like and as it was lived in the British Army in Burma. The eminent historian John Keegan rates &quot;Quartered Safe Out Here&quot; better than Manchester's &quot;Goodbye Darkness&quot; and E.B. Sledge's &quot;With the Old Breed,&quot; an opinion I do not necessarily share, but I do admire this book tremendously.<br />This is a great introduction to the war in Burma and a wonderful glimpse into life in the British Army in World War II.	2003-03-09

Carlo D'Este after publishing works on Normandy, Sicily, Anzio and a brief work on the war in the Mediterranean, tries his hand at biography. And what an effort! <br />Patton is an out and out classic. Not since Farago's Patton: Ordeal and Triumph, has someone attempted a complete and thorough work on this controversial, complicated and charismatic figure. Most Patton bios tend to go lightly over the General's beginnings, not so D'Este. Here, he gives the reader a full treatment of Patton's origins. From his Confederate ancestry and the famous Don Benito Wilson, we see Patton go from a struggling youth, to a young man obssessed with wanting to be a career soldier.  Other wonderful stories abound. My personal favorite is the one where Patton's daughters shock the family by reciting a profanity laced poem (carefully instructed by Daddy).<br />World War II takes up nearly half the book, but that's not surprising. All facets of his WWII career are gone over. Third Army buffs may be disappointed that Patton's tenure with his fabled Army is only given 100 pages, but considering how much of his life was spent with Third Army, it's understandable.<br />Well, written, carefully researched, entertaining, this is what all military biographies should shoot for.<br />\\"They'll lose their fear of the Germans, I hope to God they'll never lose their fear of me.\\"  Lieutenant General George S.

What can be said that hasn't already been said about this great book?<br />Joseph Balkoski has crafted (to me, not just written, but crafted like a gem) a superb history which will stand as a tribute to all those who not only served in the Blue and Gray Division, but to all who served in the infantry divisions in the Normandy campaign.<br />We see the 29ers from their training camps in Maryland and Virginia, to deployment in England, to Omaha Beach to the bloody, but triumphant entry into St. Lo. Along the way, we see the personalities, General Gehrhardt, Major Tom Howie, Glover Johns and Charles Cawthon endure the training, D-Day and the hedgerow slaughter. <br />But Balkoski just doesn't rehash old facts. He compares the 29th to its German counterpart, the 352nd Infanterie Division. He shows German methods and compares the weapons used by both sides and explains why the fighting in Normandy was an attacker's nightmare and a defender's dream. <br />In the end, the 29ers bested their foemen, but not without cost. Mr. Balkoski has written a tribute to them that will stand the test of time.	2003-02-23

I've read it a few times and I marvel at the every day heroism displayed by the hungry, sex-starved men of Stalag Luft III.<br />My own copy is the First Edition, printed by Norton in 1950 and signed by George Harsh who wrote the Introduction. I got it for an astonishing $12 and it's one of the most treasured books in my collection.<br />It's part memoir and historical account. You read as the POWs begin their audacious plan and despite for many of them, what would be a tragic ending, you marvel at what these men had to endure and go through.<br />Despite the tragedy, this is no weepy account. This is a testimony to the human spirit which triumphs in the face of human isolation. They are prisoners true, but they in the end, are the ones to triumph over nazism.<br />The movie of course, inspired me to read the book, but just remember that the movie's characters are fictional composites of the real men. It would do well to remember the old cliche, \\"the book is always better than the movie,\\" which is entirely true in this case.<br />A Wonderful Book.<br />Read It.	2003-02-23

It's a fun book, but at times, I thought I was reading a magazine article that was fleshed out to make it into a book. <br />Mr. Sides writes well and his book kept me going. But I didn't like the shifting chapters. One chapter was on the ordeal of the POWs, the next on the mission to raid the Cabanatuan POW camp. Not all of the veterans interviewed were at Cabanatuan when the Rangers attacked it. I personally think he should have stuck to a standard story line, first, follow the POWs and their terrible odyssey, then go to the Rangers and their daring rescue of these starved and emaciated heroes. <br />But again, it was nice to see a book about the Pacific capture the public's imagination after all these ETO books, get so much publicity.<br />It's a fun, exciting read, but I believe far from the best. Try reading Dorothy Cave's Beyond Courage, One Regiment against Japan 1941-1945. That is a superb work.	2003-02-22

The Angry Hills, QB VII, Armageddon, but Battle Cry is my favorite. It's the only Uris novel I've read more than once. Plus, being a former Marine, well, my views are a little biased here.<br />Why four and a half stars? Well, the books is a touch slow in a few places, but it's such a fast moving read, that the slower parts don't last all that long.<br />Based on Uris's own experiences with 2/6 (2nd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division), this novel follows the radio section of the battalion from Guadalcanal (the Canal in WWII Marine lingo) to Tarawa and climaxes with the bloody invasion of Saipan. There's plenty of combat action to satisfy the most blood thirsty reader, and enough romance to keep readers of a more gentle nature to keep turning the pages.<br />It's interesting to note that many former World War II Marines said Battle Cry truly echoed their own wartime experiences. Uris's focus is not only combat, but the training and what the Marines did when they got liberty.<br />What also makes Battle Cry unique is that it's told in BOTH first and third person. A most difficult thing to try to do, but Uris pulls it off.<br />Marines past and present will see similarities of their service time here whether they were in Vietnam, Korea or the Gulf. There's a universal quality to this novel which explains why it's one of Uris's most popular books. The movie isn't bad either.<br />Semper Fidelis Mr. Uris.	2003-02-12

Chester Wilmot was uniquely qualified to write this exhaustive history. He was a war correspondent who made the jump on June 6, so in some ways his narrative of D-Day's opening is a memoir, a trained historian and an exhaustive researcher. This book occupied him for six years and even though it was published in 1952, it was and still is, a remarkably objective history of the war in Europe.<br />First, the flaws. It's not complete. There's no account on the fall of France or Poland or Norway for that matter. It opens when the Germans have the BEF trapped in the channel ports in May 1940. But this is understandable. Wilmot's assertion that Hitler's letting the BEF get away sowed the the seeds for it's eventual return to the continent. Second, the Russian Front (which actually WON the war in Europe by the way) is dealt with only summarily and the Pacific is only discussed in terms of overall Grand Strategy. He also only mentions the war in the Mediterranean in passing. His Cold War conclusions were off as well, but this is said of course with hindsight. But considering when this was published (1952 originally), it's understandable for Wilmot for feeling that way. <br />The strengths of this book is that if you want a first rate narrative of the whats, the hows and the whys on how the War in Western Europe was fought, then this is the book.<br />Wilmot covers every possible aspect of the Western European campaign. From grand strategy, to desperate battles to blunders committed on both sides.<br />American readers might be peeved the way Wilmot praises Montgomery and not enough flattering comments are given Eisenhower and Patton (though both do receive their share). Frankly, I think it's high time Monty gets some good recognition over here. You don't become a Field Marshal in any Army by being incompetent. He was a good general, maybe even a great one. He gave the British Army its first real victory over the Germans, something no other British general had yet to do.<br />Wilmot also discusses the political machinations of both sides. The Allies were far superior to Hitler when it came to this. Also he discusses the economics of the war; something few if any military historians did at the time. Today, it's a common practice, but in 1952, it was a radical new approach.<br />John Keegan's recommendation of this in his history of the Second World War got me to purchasing a copy. He still believes it's unsurpassed in many ways. I have to agree.<br />I don't agree with everything Wilmot said, but I think that's what makes a good history book. You have points to debate and discuss. After all, history is always interpretive.	2003-02-12

This is a highly informative book. Col. Doubler basically analyzes the obstacles faced by the GI's in the ETO and how they overcame them; bocage, fortifications, urban warfare, river crossings, the massacre in the Hurtgen Forest, the defense as used in the Ardennes and how the GIs made effective use of air support. Doubler states the possible problems, the possible doctrine the Army had at the time and how the GIs eventually found a solution. <BR>His focus in this case is the American Army from June 6 1944 to May 8, 1945, the lessons learned in North Africa and Italy are dealt with only summarily, but Doubler's focus is on the ETO. He calls into question some of Russell Weigley's conclusions which he published in Eisenhower's Lieutenants, as well as Martin VanCreveld's opinions of Fighting Power. The GIs were adaptable and quick learners. They were much tougher than believed, and could improvise much better than the British or the Germans. If the enemy came upon a problem not covered by their manuals, they were usually helpless, not so the Americans.<BR>The problem with the book is that each chapter reads like an article for a professional military man's magazine. His writing style is quite dry, so you won't get through this as you would say, like Stephen Ambrose or Peter Mansoor.<br />Still, an essential book on the GIs in Europe. Definitely worth the effort and time to read it.	2003-02-09

Since the appearance in 1980 of Russel Weigley's Eisenhower's Lieutenants, many books, critical of the U.S. Army's performance in the ETO have appeared. Martin VanCreveld's Fighting Power, whose thesis was that the German units were better than the American, Max Hasting's Overlord, which practically ignored the GIs. The one main theme was not only were the German units superior, but that the Allies used their air superiority and their numerical superiority on the ground to grind down the German units, thus achieving victory.<BR>Now, since the 1990s, another school has been emerging. Most of this school are professional soldiers writing and supporting their own theses. Michael Doubler, Robert Sterling Rush and of course, Colonel Mansoor.<BR>His book focuses on the US infantry divisions, not on the airborne or other such elite outfits. His view is also comprehensive, focusing not only on the ETO, but North Africa and Italy as well and now American infantry divisions eventually surpassed their German counterparts in efficiency and fighting ability. The ETO, starting on 6 June, is where the schooling in Italy and North Africa and their lessons came into play and was used most effectively in France and Belgium.<BR>He does criticize certain portions of Army policy, calling into question the replacement system and never rotating units out of the line to rest and refit as well as the 90 division limit. Still on the whole, Mansoor believes and shows credible evidence that the American infantry divisions performed better than not only their German opponents, but that of their Allies as well.<BR>Mansoor should also get credit in that his book is always engaging and never dull, especially when tossing figures and facts around, you run the risk of writing a really dull book, but Mansoor's a good writer and you stay with him.<br />This is a good analysis and a broad overview of the GI and his magnificent triumph against not only the enemy to his front, but those from behind as well.	2003-02-09

What a superb book. Featherston, a journalist by trade, made himself into a first rate military historian with this, his first published work. He even outdoes the mighty Stephen Ambrose here. His focus is the 30th Infantry Division's lone stand at Mortain, as it bore the brunt of the German last great Panzer assault in France.<BR>Much has been written about Mortain, how the Germans threw away their last bit of armored strength in this hopeless, Hitler ordered counterattack (Operation 'Luttich', the German word for Liege, a city in Belgium) and its subsequent repulse. Far too much credit has been given the Allied air forces in this battle and not enough to the infantrymen who faced the onslaught on the ground. <BR>That fact was, that despite air support, the Old Hickory Division met the Germans head on, and this was some of the best German military units, the Waffen SS in addition to other Panzer divisions, and it beat them cold.<BR>Featherston, interviews the veterans and they tell their story with pride, as I think they should. They took on the best Hitler had, and stopped the vaunted German Panzer force dead in its tracks.<br />This is a must have for any ETO fan.	2003-02-08

It reminds me very much of Bruce Catton's &quot;A Stillness at Appomattox,&quot; one of the most powerful Civil War books ever written.<BR>However, some sloppy research (like Fritz Bayerlein commanding the 12th SS Panzer Division, he commanded the Panzer Lehr-though to Ambrose's and Simon and Schuster's credit, was corrected in subsequent printings) creeped into the text, thus marring what I thought was an excellent work overall. The end result was a wonderful portrait of the U.S. Army from June 1944 to May 1945.<BR>What I liked most is that Ambrose rarely stayed at the Generals' level instead, his interest is in the men who did the dirty work. He stays with the GI's, thus, we see the ETO as they experienced it; what it smelled and above all else, felt like.<BR>Those looking for a complete portrait of the Western European campaign are advised to look elsewhere. Ambrose's interest is with the American Army and that is exactly where he stays. He differs with stalwarts like Russell Weigley and believes that the GIs were a fierce enemy in the field. Ambrose also gets the German side of the story so we don't get a skewed view of events (it's nice to see what's happening on the other side of the hill for a change).<BR>For specialists of the ETO, I believe Ambrose is nothing new. Those who want more books of a specialist nature might wish to read Michael Doubler (whom Ambrose cites in his work) or Peter Mansoor or Robert Sterling Rush. Each has written works on the GIs in the ETO and each is excellent.<BR>For those getting started on their WWII reading, I think Citizen Soldiers is an excellent place to start.	2003-02-05

'A Bridge Too Far' is the best account of Market-Garden ever written. And, just like his prior two works, 'The Longest Day' and 'The Last Battle' Ryan takes more of an interest in what happened to the people who experienced the greatest airborne operation of the war and its terrible aftermath.<br />I always gathered that 'A Bridge Too Far' is a monument to human courage and that Ryan used Market-Garden as his canvas to make his eloquent point.<br />The book starts of with the little town of Driel (as well as ends there) and we see the drama open and unfold as the Germans, having been routed from Normandy and France altogether, are withdrawing from Holland in chaotic fashion. The Dutch begin to wonder if the Allies are coming. The Germans eventually stabilize their lines in time to receive the landings. When the paratroopers finally land, they are in the fight for their lives as the Germans attack them ceaselessly. <br />You will read with wonderment at the bravery of the Dutch who aid both liberators and occupiers with humanity, the valor of the troopers of Julian Cook's battalion as they cross the Waal River in rickety boats under heavy German fire, the magnificent stand of John Frost's battalion at Arnhem Bridge, the steadfast determination of Roy Urquhart's Red Devils, the dedication of the troops of Bittrich's II Panzer Korps in protecting what they believed was the direst threat to their homes.<br />I can't praise this book highly enough. It completes an epic trilogy Mr. Ryan started with the Longest Day. It's tragic, but never weepy, it never engages in 'could have, should have' discussions, but let's the story do the talking (a sign of first rate reporting).<br />This is the finest monument of Market-Garden we are ever likely to have.	2003-02-01

In just a little over 300 pages, Mr. Ryan caught the epic drama and sweep of the Normandy invasion. But the reader should be reminded that while D-Day is the focus, the book starts on June 4, then follows both the Allied and German sides. <br />What really struck me is that Mr. Ryan wrote it so soon after the war (first published in 1959) and yet there isn't a note of triumphalism in the whole thing or a note of bragging as victors are sometimes wont to do. He is wonderfully objective and whatever biases he may have had, he subordinates to the story. He also never engages in what each side should have done as many historians do.<br />While this was written and published prior to the revelation of Ultra and the Enigma codes, it fails to diminish the book's power and readability.<br />If you want a good primer on D-Day what it felt like, then this is the best book to start.	2003-02-01

It's hard to say or add to what has already been said about Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning masterpiece. His son Jeff recalled once that on the visit to Gettysburg that inspired Shaara to begin writing Killer Angels was when somehow, Shaara was seeing something else that no one else could see. He was on a different plane. He could actually see the titanic struggle whereas others could only see stone markers. Soon after the visit, he began to write and research his novel.<BR>To keep his book at a managable length, he had to choose judiciously. Culp's Hill was left out almost completely as was General Custer (who stopped Jeb Stuart east of Gettysburg on the third day) as a character.<BR>Still, I think it's the best Civil War novel ever written. <BR>I owe Shaara a debt. His novel was read by Ken Burns who was so inspired by it that he undertook his Civil War documentary, which then got me interested in the period.<BR>A great novel.

Her blurb on the back jacket of Cold Mountain said it was the best CW novel since Killer Angels (a personal favorite of mine) and that the writing compares favorably to that of Shelby Foote. Well, that worked on me. I just had to read it then.<br />Since then, I've read the novel twice. It's very good and its long residence on the bestseller list I thought warranted and it was nice to see a novel high in literary quality and originality garner a large readership.<br />Despite its excellence, I thought that there were some things Frazier could and should have done differently. Bear in mind that my suggestions probably wouldn't have much if any effect on the overall story.<br />My differences derive mainly from Inman's war service, while a minor thing, but it still bothers me. Inman's regiment is never identified and his skepticism of the leaders of the Army of Northern Virginia don't ring true. Also Frazier uses &quot;withering fire&quot; which in the words of Stephen Cushman in Bloody Promenade, is &quot;one of the top five cliches in Civil War battle writing.&quot; But the thing that bothers me most is that Frazier never mentions is if Inman has a close friend. Being a veteran, I know that friends and comrades are what makes service life bearable and the idea of a man, a veritable loner, making it through three plus years of war without friends is stretching the limits of credibility. Also if Frazier had mentioned this friend being killed at Gettysburg or the Wilderness, I think Inman's disillusionment and his reasons for deserting would have been much more believeable.<br />Again, it's a minor thing. All in all, I found myself enjoying Inman's physical journey as well as Ada's own internal journey to self discovery.<br />I myself can't wait for Frazier's next offering.	2003-01-18

Published in 1952, Shelby Foote's fourth novel, attracted minimal public attention, but the critics and individuals in publishing took notice.  One of them was Bennett Cerf of Random House who then afforded Foote the oppurtunity to write a short, one volume history of the Civil War. The rest, as they say, is history.<br />Back to the novel. Shiloh is simple enough, a relatively short novel which is simply about what the title says, a story of the April 1862 battle which produced the first battle where the casualties equalled that of Waterloo, some 47 years earlier. Foote does what Michael Shaara would do in his Pulitzer Prize winning Killer Angels nearly 20 years later; view the battle with altering Union and Confederate viewpoints. The difference is that when Foote has a historical character speak (like Ulysses Grant or Nathan Bedford Forrest) it's the words they were definitely known to use at the battle. Nothing on the real life characters is made up. Not that Killer Angels comes up short. It's arguably the greatest Civil War novel ever written, but you can see the blueprint of it in Shiloh.<br />I enjoyed this novel very much. It got me to want to read the three volume narrative. I think that this is probably better than most historical accounts of Shiloh. It's certainly more entertaining.	2003-01-18

The Civil War will never lack for authors, both fiction and historical. Only a handful will leave a reader with an indellible impression. Among these few: Douglas Southall Freeman, Shelby Foote and James M. McPherson. Each has written outstanding works on the war: Freeman; R.E. Lee and Lee's Lieutenants, Foote; Shiloh and his magisterial three volume narrative and McPherson, his brilliant Battle Cry of Freedom.<BR>Magnificent works all, but in a class by himself is Bruce Catton. <BR>I recall my father raving about Catton; \\"When you read him, it's like you're there,\\" he said. Unfortunately, I wasn't so quick to take his advice. Then, in 2000, I saw David McCullough on C-Span 2 and he raved about \\"A Stillness at Appomattox.\\" Then, I decided to give it a try.<BR>Lucky for me. I've read many accounts regarding the last agonizing year of the war, but none has matched Catton for sheer storytelling power. One marches with the Army of the Potomac as it seeks out Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia. You witness and somehow, almost take part as these, the war's two military giants, Grant and Lee collide. You see the mistakes and agonize with the men yet, you always stand in awe of the everyday valor these heroes of the Blue and the Gray make. But despite battlefield blunders and poor leadership, draftees who are more likely to desert than face the enemy, the men of the Army of the Potomac never lose their faith in themselves and it is this spirit that drives the Army to ultimate victory.<BR>Words fail me to describe how awesome this book is. I thought it would have aged badly, but it hasn't. It's truly a timeless work. This book, along with Mr. Lincoln's Army and Glory Road constitute the greatest tribute to the men of the Army of the Potomac and in a way, the Army of Northern Virginia as well. <br />Enjoy.	2003-01-11

This three volume set is, without a doubt, one of the greatest literary and historical achievements ever. I think it's one of the five most important works ever written on the Civil War. Flawlessly written, carefully paced and plotted, it's weds the art and craft of a novelist along with the meticulous research of an exacting historian.<br />Approached by Bennet Cerf in 1954 about writing a short one volume history of the war, Foote accepted and like Douglas Southall Freeman, discovered that a much longer treatment would be the only way he could do the subject justice . He asked Cerf if he could \\"go spread eagle, whole hog\\" on it. Cerf gave him the go ahead. Twenty years later, he completed the third volume, \\"Red River to Appomattox\\" in 1974.<br />His narrative reads quickly, it's detailed, yet never in a flogging way. Foote reveals his characters in pieces. He never bogs the reader down with five pages of background on a particular character, but instead, he gives them snapshots which serve to illuminate them.<br />\\"The Civil War: A Narrative\\" is probably 75% military and 25% political. Foote is a southerner, yet I don't think the books lean in any particular direction. Foote also doesn't divulge in opinions on any figures. He usually let's the story do the talking, a difficult thing to do in such an opinionated war- and he pulls it off.<br />If you've read Companion Volume to the PBS series, then to McPherson, you're then ready for Foote. I can't imagine a better, more thorough and detailed treatment that is so gripping. This masterpiece deserves no less than five stars. SUPERB!	2003-01-02

Foote doesn't overwhelm the reader the details, but instead, and with careful literary design, catches the ebb and flow of a great battle as it opens and occurs.<BR>If you've read the trilogy, then you probably don't need this, but it certainly is a lot easier to tote around than the rather ponderous size of the others. Also, if you're quite familiar with Gettysburg, then Foote may not be anything new, but I do think his mastery of the language eclipses most of what's out there (how historians drain the life out of such an exciting subject I'll never know).<BR>If you enjoyed this, I heartily recommend you pick up \\"Stars in Their Courses\\" in the audio where Foote reads the book himself. You listen to his voice and I'd hazard a guess that it's like listening to Homer read the Iliad or the Odyssey. Foote's melodious voice is mesmerizing and becomes a performance in itself.<br />Foote deserves a 21 gun salute.	2003-01-02

Anyone who says otherwise I think, is utter nonsense. <br />If you want to know how the war started, the status of the economies of both North and South, the politicians, the Generals, this simply is the book.<br />It is utterly free of bias. Perhaps some southerners might quibble with McPherson's view that slavery was one of the primary causes, but the way he writes his argument, it is hard to disagree with him.<br />Perhaps another grievance those might have is that it's not just a military history, but rather, a political one as well. This, I think is absolutely essential. Each had an effect on the other. If, let's say, a General appointed by Lincoln suffers a defeat (like John Pope for instance) at the hands of R. E. Lee, it had definite political consequences on how Lincoln will carry out his policy and war aims. McPherson shows this clearly.<br />Aside from superb analysis, McPherson is a outstanding writer. You never have to reread passages to understand his or his point. All political and military figures get their due here.<br />The only thing one might have a problem with is the maps. Hugh Brogan said orginally in the New York Times Book Review, that the Confederate movements are a bit difficult to see, but that's about it.<br />For the uninitiated, start with the Ken and Ric Burns/Geoffrey War Civil War book, then McPherson. If you want more, then move on to the master, Shelby Foote.	2002-12-24

The story is well told how Douglas Southall Freeman went on to write this four volume magnum opus. Born in 1886, the son of Confederate veteran Walker Burford Freeman, young Douglas grew up in the sunny remembrances of Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia. He received his Ph.D in history at the tender age of 22 and earned an early reputation as a Confederae scholar with Calendar of Confederate Papers. Then followed Lee's Dispatches, which he edited. He wrote an introduction to Lee's Dispatches that was so brilliant, Scribner's signed him on to write a biography of Lee. Freeman believed he could complete the job in two years.<br />20 years later, he was finished. In that time, America fought in a world war, women won the right to vote, and the original editor who signed Freeman on died and left the legendary Maxwell Perkins in charge.<BR>All through it, Freeman labored on the biography like a demon. He discovered early on that most of the major sources were either never consulted or only skimmed over. He searched far and wide. He carried on a schedule that would have killed a lesser man. He awoke at 2:30 every morning, put a full day in at the Richmond Newspaper where he was an editor at, delivered two radio addresses each day, then back home to work on the biography.<br />After twenty years and four massive volumes, he was done. Unanimous praise was heaped on his book and rightly so. It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in biography in 1935. It was and still remains the most thorough biography of Lee ever done and will probably never be surpassed.<br />Readers looking for a book that will take R. E. Lee to task will be disappointed. Freeman is an unabashed admirer of Lee. Longstreet admirers will find Freeman's highly critical remarks of him in volume 3 during the Gettysburg Campaign aggravating. Freeman's Lee is a great man. Plus, why spend 20 years of your life reading and writing about a man you loathe?<br />I never believed Lee was the saint certain Confederate veterans painted him to be. He was a human being and he had his share of flaws. But he was a good man who did what he thought was right and a great general. Freeman's research is awesome and his writing style (which Shelby Foote once described as a sort of \\"jog trot prose\\") while dated in some aspects (Freeman loves to use \\"whither\\" and \\"tither\\" whereas \\"where\\" and \\"there\\" would have been better), and the Freeman's overly critical treatment of Longstreet not withstanding, it is still an awesome book. Lee's campaigns are exhaustively detailed, and the maps are profuse and always keep the reader informed as to what the Army of Northern Virginia was doing at any given time.<br />I would strongly recommend readers use Ezra Warner's \\"Generals in Gray\\" in conjunction with this work. I did and when Freeman parades the various personalities of the Army of Northern Virgina in front of the reader, the names can be confusing. Warner's book will give you illustrations of the men of Lee's command, and you will glad you got it. The book will come alive which is the purpose of all biographies.<br />Lastly, Thomas Connelly's \\"The Marble Man\\" will give the reader a good counterbalance to Freeman. Still even Connelly admitted to someone once that \\"R. E. Lee\\" was still \\"the greatest biography ever written.\\" I have to agree. At four volumes, I didn't want to stop. Give Freeman a chance, you'll be glad you did.<br />One last note. You might also wish to start with \\"Lee\\" a one volume abridgement. Freeman's understudy, Richard Harwell did a painstaking abridgement and it is a wonderful one volume work. Of course, the superb maps that went with the 4 volume set are gone and replaced by more general maps, still it's a good bet in case 4 volumes are too daunting.	2002-11-29

Avoid the Vintage quality paperback edition which is simply the text of the book without the wonderful illustrations. <br />I think the illustrations and the text are made for each other and Knopf did a wonderful job pairing them together. Ward and the Burns brothers (remember, Ric Burns had a hand in this project too so Ken shouldn't get all the credit) chose judiciously and well. The book admittedly doesn't match the overall power of the series but it certainly does well on it's own. The end result is a big, beautiful book you'd be proud to have on your coffee table.<br />If there is a downside to this volume, it's probably in the tone in which it was written. It's definitely got a Yankee bias to it. The idea that either McClellan or Meade could have \\"destroyed\\" Lee at any time seems a bit absurd given Lee's military gifts and leadership. No doubt they could have possibly inflicted grievous losses on Lee (McClellan prior to and during Sharpsburg, and Meade following Gettysburg), but that was highly unlikely and only on the condition that the Army of Northern Virginia would have been placed in a do or die fight (except possibly Chancellorsville).<br />Other flaws I'd have to say is the typical slavery argument and  Barbara J. Fields. Slavery was a major cause, but that isn't all. Frankly, I'd like to think that the War started simply because there was too much antagonistic feelings between North and South. They simply didn't like each other anymore. Fields' essay is utterly dismissable. Her comments on the series were annoying and her \\"knowledge\\" of the war shallow. There was much more to the war than that.<br />Despite these flaws, the book has far more strengths. James McPherson contributes a good essay as does C. Van Woodward. Ken Burns' two day interview with Shelby Foote (which gave the series the majority of its warmth) is included in here albeit in edited form and to me, is nearly worth the price alone.<br />If you're just starting out reading about the Civil War, buy this or borrow it. It's worth the time. Certainly worth the money if you can afford it.	2002-11-15

It was an instant bestseller and later made into a movie with Donald Sutherland and Kate Nelligan. <br />The premise: Henry Faber (codename: \\"Die Nadel\\") an individualistic and ruthless German agent (one of the last German spies not scooped up by MI5) is assigned to investigate whether or not Lt. General Patton's First United States Army Group is massing in East Anglia for the expected invasion of Calais, the area the German High Command expects the Allies to assault. Faber discovers that Patton's Army is a phony. The Allies are deceiving German intelligence with fake messages, troop concentrations and dummy barracks (which look real to German reconnaisance aircraft).<br />However careful as Faber is, the British counterintelligence agents Percival Godliman and Fred Bloggs, a history professor and policeman respectively, are a brilliant team that discover \\"Die Nadel\\" and are hot on his trail.<br />Eluding the police and the Home Guard and killing any and all who suspect his identity, Faber heads north to make a rendezvouz with a U-boat. His escape is thwarted by bad weather and he is washed ashore on Storm Island, a nearly deserted piece of rock in the North Sea, where Lucy Rose, a beautiful, but frustrated wife of a legless RAF pilot lives. In time, she discovers Faber's true identity....<br />I don't usually like thrillers, but this one kept me up. I read it over 20 years ago and have read it a few times since. Follett is a good story teller and his research for the story is wonderful. His portrayals of the German leaders, Hitler, Rundstedt and Rommel are superb.<br />I liked the film version too, though I believe it would be ideal for a remake (my choices for Faber would be Ralph Fiennes and for Lucy Kate Winslett or Helena Bonham Carter).<br />Time hasn't dimmed this book. It still holds up and is a classic of World War II espionage. Enjoy.	2002-10-24

John Le Carre (David Cornwell) took the espionage novel away from the ridiculous and campy world of James Bond and the Man from U.N.C.L.E. and made it into serious literature with this, his third published novel.<BR>Readers may be struck by how bleak Le Carre's world is in this book. The story, Alec Leamas, a veteran agent goes on his last mission into the Zone (East Germany) in an effort to combat the East German intelligence (The Abteilung) from discovering a deeply planted British agent. Le Carre's staple character, George Smiley makes an appearance here, but it's Leamas who dominates the book. He's angry and cynical, but a dedicated agent. The other characters, Liz, Fiedler and Mundt are also wonderfully drawn and believeable. Le Carre keeps the plot moving without sacrificing his characters (sometimes difficult to do in the thriller genre). The result is a deeply felt, wonderfully written thriller. The final twist (if you're smart, you'll figure it out) is very satisfying and reveals the hypocrisy of the Communists and Western Powers and the callous regard for human life and dedication to one's cause. A core of high intelligence runs through this novel, yet you never have to reread passages to find out what happened. It's beautifully written and highly controlled. Le Carre is in total control of the reader and we're seduced by his dazzling prose. The most amazing thing is forty years later with the end of the Cold War, this ageless work still holds up. It has gone from a commentary piece to historical literature and retains it's power. What more can be said for a classic than that? <br />I noticed that Cliff's Notes has a companion to this work. That, I think shows what a classic Mr. Cornwell has penned. It's that good. This is a novel to read, digest and ponder.	2002-10-24

Commander Stafford's book in an action packed account of the Navy's most decorated ship. The Enterprise's story is in many ways, the story of the Navy in the Pacific.

Commander Stafford's book is a perfect example of what good history is all about. It's gripping, easily read and best of all, always clear. You never have to reread passages to understand what he had written. To wrap this review up, if you're a World War II navy buff, you simply HAVE to read this book. You'll be glad you did.<BR>One last thing. Commander Stafford also wrote Little Ship, Big War: the Saga of the U.S.S. Abercrombie DE343. This is a history/memoir of the destroyer he served on during the war. This too is recommended.

It should be noted that Murphy wrote less than 10 percent of the book himself. In fact, the bulk of the book was written buy a fellow veteran and Hollywood screenwriter (and full-time alcoholic) David \\"Spec\\" McClure. Their collaborative process in writing the book is interesting. McClure would use Murphy's medal citations and Donald Taggart's classic \\"History of the Third Infantry Division in World War II,\\" for solid reference, then he would interview Murphy, that is, provided if he was so inclined to speak. If the session was fruitful, much was done. If it wasn't, it went slow. Murphy would then read over what was done and either he would approve it or send it back. Sometimes, McClure would get so annoyed when Audie would send a passage back he'd yell at Murphy, \\"Well what DID happen?\\" then Murphy would tell him. It took them a year, but they finally completed it. The result was a bestseller and a future movie adaptation.<br />One thing about this book for a more contemporary reader: this book is packed with a lot of dialogue much of which borders on the hokey. Still, that doesn't lessen the impact of Murphy's story. Also he never mentions his medals. His tone at times screams of modesty. Sometimes, you don't even know he's there, he lets his friends and comrades-in-arms do most of the talking (in here, their names are fictionalized). The book's dedication to two of his buddies who were killed in action should come off as no surprise.<br />I'm glad to see this classic being reprinted. Let's hope it never goes out of print.	2002-04-21

It remained with me then and it remains with me now. I've now read it at least three times and I had forgotten what a wonderfully powerful novel Mr. Hasford crafted. I heard that it took him seven years effort and though it's only a brief 180 pages, it's simple, yet dense. You can read and re-read passages for the pure mastery of the english language Mr. Hasford has so painstakingly done here.<br />Kubrick's \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is a wonderful film, but reading the \\"Short-timers,\\" I came away with a different vision. Nowhere is this more true that the recruit training sequence (\\"The Spirit of the Bayonet\\") where the training Joker and Cowboy go through is particularly sadistic. I only thank God that my own boot camp experience wasn't anywhere near as harrowing.<br />One last thing, some reviewers say that the novel's ending is even more bleak than \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" and they are right. To tell more would, I think, spoil the book's effect. If you can find this, read it. I got lucky and found a copy for very cheap. If you're a former Marine, don't be surprised if you find many similarities between the Corps of '68 and whenever you served. Don't be further surprised and find yourself rereading it again and again. <br />I've since found out that Mr. Hasford died in 1993. What a shame. While he has co-authored the screenplay as well as wrote two other novels, none has ever approached \\"The Short-timers.\\" At least with this masterpiece, he wrote one for the ages.<br />Get some Mr. Hasford.

Marine, gentleman, journalist, scholar, novelist, author, Manchester earned each of these and no doubt deserved them all.     If any writer had \\"the touch,\\" it truly was Manchester. His narrative power would snare you and it didn't even matter what the subject was. Here was a writer to envy. His prose was that lyrical, that seductive.    \\"Goodbye, Darkness\\" is hands down, my all time favorite memoir of World War II. There is no idiotic flag waving in this book. Nor any preaching. Rather, we see a man struggling and finally coming to terms with the most visceral experience of his life.    You probably won't find a gorier book on the savagery of the fighting in the Pacific. From beginning to end, Manchester shoves the reader's nose into the mud, death and horror that was his war.     Yet, one also finds Manchester was clearly proud of being a Marine (though like many \\"former active duty Marines,\\" he also has highly ambivalent feelings towards his former branch of service as do I), and in his nation's accomplishments during the war.    The book does have a complicated structure. So be advised. MANCHESTER ONLY FOUGHT ON OKINAWA. Any combat reminiscences in the book whether it be from Guadalcanal or Tarawa are reflected from Manchester's Okinawa experience.    Forget any negative reviews of the book you read here. Those who posted them are ignorant or worse, biased. Goodbye Darkness is a masterpiece of literature. It should be etched in marble.	2002-03-21

The book has the stinging ring of authenticity and no wonder, Webb was a Marine officer in Vietnam himself and won the Navy Cross, a Silver Star and two Bronze Stars so he definitely knows of what he writes. <br />But this isn't just a book written by an officer about officers. His portraits of the enlisted men are just as real and are full blooded characters. Some are tough, mean and unlikeable, but hey, that's real life for you.<br />And just like real life, you'll find yourself bonding and getting close to these characters and when some are killed, you are affected.<br />Be warned: \\"Fields of Fire\\" isn't a happy story. The ending is tragic but given the setting of the story, it's entirely appropriate. <br />Mr. Webb has done himself and the Marines who served in Vietnam a great honor.<br />Semper Fi Mr. Webb.	2002-03-21

It came out when most books on World War II were about generals, or not even about the fighting. Burgett's book was a reminder that war is essentially about young men trying to kill other young men and the hell of it all. I purchased this book when Bantam reissued it under the title \\"As Eagles Screamed.\\" I still have that copy and have read it several times. <BR>All I can say is that if you're picking up this book for the first time, you're in for a treat. If you've already read it, well then you know how good it is. Burgett's books are a fine companion piece to Ambrose's \\"Band of Brothers.\\" In some ways, it's even better because we see the whole war through the eyes of one man who survived it's most horrible moments.	2002-02-26

But one thing should be kept in mind; even if you got Spielberg to direct it, Tom Hanks to produce it, and the most authentic WWII gear to make it look real, it would be missing the one thing the original movie has: Audie Murphy himself.<br />This cinematic treatment of his ghostwritten World War II memoir of the same name differs in many ways from the book. Novak is killed when Murphy was in the hospital according to the book, but in the movie, he dies before Murphy's eyes. Audie is seen at the film's beginning taking care of the family; in truth, he was in orphanages. But again, the movie has Murphy.<br />And for me, that's enough. Not too many heroes get to portray themselves on the screen. And Audie had enough acting ability to play himself on the screen (something Mickey Mantle or Jackie Robinson couldn't really do with all due respect).<br />Still, it's a fun movie and it does give viewers Murphy's war experiences in a nice digestible hour and a half. Heck, even if half of what is portrayed on the screen was true, Murphy's war experiences would eclipse 99% of all the others (the guys of E Company in Band of Brothers are included here too).<br />It's a good intro to Murphy's war career if somehow his book is too daunting or if one doesn't have the time.	2002-02-26

Bios of Audie Murphy are either too worshipful or try to highlight his all too obvious flaws. Mr. Graham to his credit does neither. No doubt he clearly admires Murphy's accomplishments as a soldier but he is less than enamored with his postwar record. Murphy fans will either love or hate this book. I enjoyed it, though I had to deduct a star when Mr. Graham wrote that the Battle of the Bulge began on December 18 (it opened on the 16th). If you make a basic mistake on that level, your book might have other such errors. Still, it's a good book and if you want an honest portrait of this tragically flawed hero, you won't do any better than this.	2002-02-08

I waited four years before I finally picked up a copy in a used bookstore, by chance, a hard cover first edition. I devoured it over the next week. I didn't want to finish it too quickly. Instead, I wanted to savor it. Even after all this time, the book still resonates with me.<BR>General Moore's book will remain a classic of not only Vietnam, but of infantry warfare. That the book has drawn comparisons to some of the greatest books ever written about warfare and warriors should surprise no one who has read it and it is certainly deserving of them. It's tone is mournful, sad, and the General still is in awe of those heroes who went with him into the Ia Drang. Anyone whoever doubts the fighting ability and dedication of the American soldier (even if it's in a place as morally ambiguous as Vietnam) should read this book and thank God that this country is so blessed to have such young men who make such sacrifices.<br />General Moore, I salute you and the heroes you have lead. God Bless.	2002-02-03

One of the best and most prolific historians has produced another epic account of &quot;The Greatest Generation,&quot; this time from the airmen's point of view. Centering on George McGovern's service with the 455th Bomb Group which was part of the 15th Air Force stationed in Italy. Ambrose transcends the boundaries and his book manages to show the day to day grind of the airmen, where one day they're flying through flak and dying horrible deaths, the next day, they're sitting in their tents utterly bored. The men who crewed the B-24s were truly the &quot;dogfaces&quot; of the air, and their contributions to the Allied victory cannot be denied. Even when the air war seemed won, there was much danger, whether it was from flak, the Luftwaffe, flying accidents, mishandling of bombs or just plain fate, these men, boys really, served their country well. Stephen Ambrose has given them a beautiful tribute that will stand the test of time.	2001-08-15

Four years ago, Ambrose declared during an interview on C-SPAN that he wasn't going to write about war any more. Fortunately, he broke that promise. The Wild Blue is a stirring tribute not only to George McGovern, but the men of the 455th Bomb Group as well as the nearly forgotten 15th Air Force which flew out of Italy.<br />Following their training in flight school, to flight training on the B-24, we see these young men, boys really, take on the awesome job of learning how to fly one of the war's best, but most difficult to fly, bombers. What makes their journey particularly harrowing is that men were dying even in flight school. So by the time they reached Italy, death was something they were already acquainted with.<br />The &quot;Dakota Queen's&quot; combat tour is a series of long range missions into Germany, Austria, Hungary and even Poland. The Luftwaffe is pretty much a spent force, but flak made the missions dangerous endeavours nonetheless. Milk runs were treasured but not all that frequent. The men of the 455th become the dogfaces of the airwar.<br />Buy this. Read it and treasure it. It's superbly written and one of Ambrose's most moving works.	2001-08-14
US	49699385	R32LH61QNBCN7U	0553279610	395697793	WAKE ISLAND	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Devereux's Own Personal Account	Brigadier General James Devereux's &quot;Story of Wake Island,&quot; is based on his own recollection and the few records available at the time. It's less than 200 pages and is the ideal book for the beginner who wants to learn about the struggle for the tiny atoll. Devereux never pretends to speak for anybody but himself, so we see the Wake Island fight unfold in his eyes and at his command post. Still, the author pays heady tribute to the other Marines with whom he served and he illustrates his account with many amusing sidebar stories. For readers who are politically and culturally sensitive, be warned: Devereux uses the epithets &quot;Japs&quot; and &quot;Jap,&quot; countless times. However, considering his ordeal in Japanese prison camps, his feelings are well understood. Still, this is a fast read and the General tells his story with simplicity and clarity. Definitely worth looking for if you care to read a good introductory yet concise account of the Battle of Wake Island.	2001-07-27

When it was finally published in 1970, it was immediately acclaimed as one of the better titles published on the Battle of the Bulge. Now, over 30 years after it's initial publication, this superb work still holds up. She accomplishes the impossible here. She manages to convey the closeness of a military unit as well as the fearful atmosphere that shrouded the Ardennes in the early days of the battle. It's like there's something personal happening here.<br />And well it should. The author's husband was a member of the 291st Engineer Battalion, so she had a personal investment in her book. She unfolds her story carefully, and as the story progresses, the impossible becomes more a reality and soon, these men, who were trained to build, not to kill or destroy, are thrown into the line in what would seem a vain attempt to derail the seemingly invincible German juggernaut. Yet despite what would seem an overwhelming assignment, they succeeded. They brought Hitler's ambitious offensive to a thudding halt by guile, tenacity and just plain guts.<br />When you read this, you'll get to know the men of the 291st and soon you'll see that they're not only a unit, but a family as well. This is Mrs. Giles' achievement. This book is out of print, but is definitely worth seeking out. Read it. Enjoy it. Treasure it. I certainly will.	2001-05-03

Donald Burgett's memoir is one of the few memoirs of the Bulge as seen from the &quot;Sharp end.&quot; Here, what became a legend is brought vividly to life. Burgett's Bastogne is a violent place, where men die quickly and violently. His account of the German assault on Noville is particularly harrowing. Burgett confesses to the reader his own amazement at having survived the maelstrom. There is no sugar coating or glossing over the details here. The soldiers' language is recreated faithfully and honestly (in short, plenty of profanity), and so are the bonds that the men develop in such atrocious circumstances.<br />Be warned: &quot;Seven Roads&quot; isn't a pleasant read. It's graphic and Burgett holds nothing back in telling his story. After reading this, the reader might wish to rent or buy the movie, &quot;Battleground,&quot; which also takes place in Bastogne. Burgett's words and &quot;Battleground's&quot; visuals will give as complete a picture of the siege as possible for one not having been there.	2001-04-23

Johns relates the stress, the worry, the fear, the exhaustion, the humor and the camaraderie with the ease of a seasoned storyteller. For the unseasoned reader, Johns's device of telling his story in the third person will take some getting use to, but that's done after only a few pages. More telling was Johns' own reasons for using third person, &quot;people who fight wars up close to the enemy are not the same while they are fighting as they were before and after...His (Johns) life during that time always seemed that of another person.&quot; After that, &quot;Clay Pigeons&quot; is a fast read. Sadly, Bantam books never reprinted this now forgotten classic. Let's hope someone will do such a service and bring this book back. It demands a reprint.	2001-02-17
