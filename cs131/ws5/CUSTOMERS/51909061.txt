Cornwell does a superb job, but for some reason I was not overwhelmed as I  have been with the other books.

Davis has pulled off quite a coup - a marriage of history and intrigue. How these three individual lives converged at the Alamo is the plot and the mystery and Davis held me spellbound, even though we all know how it ends. Stripped of the myths actually makes these three stand taller, even though they were far from perfect (even felonious at times). This lengthy treat moves very quickly. Great, great read!	1998-07-18

One of Peters's best plots. Despite Cadfael's absence in the middle of the narrative, this chronicle kept my attention.  This is a deeply religious experience as Peters examines some of the origins of Christian dogma through her characters. As always it is Peters's style that sets it above the common mystery. Trurly one of the best of the Cadfael series.	1998-07-12

The book also bogs down in tedious defenses of some of the controversal accusations levelled against Davis after the CW. It fact some of the more interesting parts are what are left out of the book as it appears Varina could not bear to discuss some topics, but  at the beginning of the book she does honestly discuss some of her husband's shortcomings.	1998-06-22

These three short stories that make up the book are good, but lack the intrigue of the novels. The first story, A Light on the Road to Woodstock, is particularly interesting in that it tells how Bro.

Not unexpectedly Jefferson Davis is portayed in too heroic a  light which dims the qualities he possessed.  The book is written as a counterpoint to the villification Davis endured in the defeat of the Confederacy. More interesting than the testimonials to Jeff Davis's character are the  pre-Civil War national and southern figures who  swirl in and out of the Davis's lives.  Also the book provides some insight from the slaveholders' view that the abolitionists were constantly harassing them with proposed legislation in the Congress.   The book is a dry read, but I recommend to anyone interested in the pre-Civil War atmosphere.  Craig Symonds's introduction errs in placing Beauvoir in Louisiana rather than rightfully in Mississippi.	1998-05-12
