This book focuses on excellent techniques that are needed for convincing upper management of the value of Six Sigma. The target audience seems to be CEOs and their top assistants. In fact the authors pretty much concede that implementing Six Sigma is impossible without CEO intervention. Little can be found to help line managers implement a culture appropriate for Six Sigma. This fine book would have been even better had they addressed line issues more aggressively and had more on how to communicate Six Sigma in a manner that would not leave the \\"rank and file\\" thinking Six Sigma is just \\"old water in new bottles\\".<br />I dare say in many companies, the rank and file will assume that Six Sigma is ineffective jargon. Further, this will to a large extent be due to oversimplified misunderstandings of Six Sigma. Most Six Sigma training emphasizes that Six Sigma is used when the solution is unknown. Yet I only hear people mention Six Sigma when they have a solution (sometimes a solution in search of a problem). \\"We need to finish this project to improve our Six Sigmas\\" and \\"we should [insert project goal] so we can all get our green belts\\" are typical of the comments I hear that are laughable to someone who understands Six Sigma.<br />This book's weakest sections are the first few chapters. The authors compare companies who had successfully adopted Six Sigma and those who did not. The authors believe that the successful adopters shared (and the unsuccessful companies did not have) the following characteristics:<BR>- committed leadership<BR>- use of top talent<BR>- supporting infrastructure<br />The authors eventually come out and say that the CEO should dedicate a percentage of his/her time to Six Sigma: money is not sufficient! Having worked at GE, this conclusion seems inevitable: Jack Welch did, in fact, put a lot of personal attention into adopting Six Sigma. However, we don't all work for someone likeJack Welch. <br />In his autobiography, Welch describes not giving bonuses to those who were not working on Six Sigma. This was his way of ensuring that all the top talent were working on Six Sigma projects because otherwise managers would be unable to reward their top talent. <br />GE had another thing going for it that set the stage of Six Sigma: a culture of managing by facts and numbers and not opinion. Remember, when other companies were \\"focusing on core strengths\\" in the mid 1980s, GE was expanding in finance, particularly leasing. Why? It supported their other businesses and created tax shelters that saved tremendous amounts of cash. As long as these subsidiaries could demonstrate ever-increasing profits, they could get ever-increasing resources. Subsidiaries that could not come up with the numbers were sold or shut down, debates about \\"core\\" or not core did not enter into the picture. In this environment, if Six Sigma could demonstrate results, the corporate culture would adopt it. Certainly, Welch's actions made Six Sigma happen more quickly, but he had won the battle long before when he fostered a results-oriented culture. <br />Being able to briefly and clearly describe what you are trying to do has become a critical tactic in modern leadership. In business we call this a \\"mission statement\\", in politics, its called, somewhat derisively, a sound bite. The next edition would benefit from the reworking of one of the early chapters to one that would help management create a Six Sigma mission statement.<br />I've read some other books NOT on Six Sigma that by analogy bring home the weakness of Six Sigma literature. To learn how to create a mission statement, I recommend Carville and Begala (2002). They used a passage in the Bible, John 3:16, as an excellent example: \\"For God so loved the world, He gave His only begotten son so that whoever believes in Him shall not die but have everlasting life.\\" They assert that this passage summarizes in 25 words the essentials of Christian theology. To paraphrase Carville and Begala, if the Bible can explain all the important tenets of Christianity in 25 words, surely 25 a word sample mission statement for Six Sigma can be provided for those who want to convince an organization to adopt it.<br />I would also recommend Michael Lewis' \\"Moneyball\\" as a companion book. Lewis (author of \\"Liar's Poker\\") uses Wall Street trading as an analogy to explain why the Oakland Athletics baseball team is one of the successful franchises with much less money than most. But I also see an analogy relevant to the topic of Six Sigma. \\"Moneyball\\" shows how one can achieve superior results by testing what everyone thinks they know with fact gathering and rigorous analyses. Moneyball will inspire anyone trying to implement Six Sigma to value testing assumptions with measurement.<br />A quick read of the reviews on Amazon will give you a feel for why people are skeptical of 6 Sigma: the feel-good tone of most writing on 6 Sigma and the insistence that it \\"is not a flavor-of-the-month management trend\\" make many of us suspect that 6 Sigma is not much more than hollow jargon and acronyms. The readers are left with the essential difficulties of positive change in any organization: you need to overcome assumptions that your organization's subculture may not even realize it has. What a corporation does by accepting Six Sigma is that it empowers people to gather data to challenge what \\"everybody knows\\". Most importantly, it sets a standard of very high quality, which reinforces the sanctioning of data-driven change.<br />I feel that this book comes up short in this regard, as do the other books I've read on Six Sigma, but otherwise is a good description on how an upper-level manager can bring about organizational change in general and implement Six Sigma in particular.	2004-01-13

In addition to an introduction to Six Sigma (albeit not as efficient introduction as \\"What Is Six Sigma?\\"), the authors go into depth on team dynamics and other project management information. <br />While the project management information is good and an excellent refresher for those who are only peripherally involved with project management, it helps to feed the Achilles heal of Six Sigma: the perception that it's the same old stuff repackaged and given inflated value.<br />A quick read of the reviews on Amazon will give you a feel for why people are skeptical of 6 Sigma: the feel-good tone of most writing on 6 Sigma and the insistence that it \\"is not a flavor-of-the-month management trend\\" make many of us suspect that 6 Sigma is not much more than hollow jargon and acronyms. <br />Lets accept that these criticisms are valid and further that many \\"practitioners\\" are just self-aggrandizing or worse. But that still leaves us with the essential difficulties of positive change in any organization: you need to overcome assumptions that your organization's subculture may not even realize it has. What a corporation does by accepting Six Sigma is that it empowers people to gather data to challenge what \\"everybody knows\\". Most importantly, it sets a very high quality standard, which further sanctions data-driven change.<br />I was not surprised to see that this book was used successfully in a college-level course on Six Sigma. That audience is less cynical that many in the corporate world and certainly could use exposure to project management.<br />I feel that the greatest flaw in Six Sigma is that many practitioners and even the books permit the basics to be lost in the shuffle. If one listens to people talk about Six Sigma, its easy to forget that a critical part of Six Sigma is that the data comes first, not the solution. I often hear co-workers say \\"we need to finish this project toimprove our six sigmas\\" or \\"if we could get rid of this server we'll all get our green belts\\".<br />The term Six Sigma is derived from statistics. This book covers all the necessary statistics and other \\"tools\\".<br />If you just want an introduction to Six Sigma, I would recommend \\"What Is Six Sigma?\\" (by some of the same authors). If you'd also like to read about project management, this book will serve you well. But be warned, you'll see feel-good digressions such as an explanation of why Sherlock Holmes would have made a great Six Sigma Black Belt. Some will find these digressions annoying. <br />I would also recommend Michael Lewis' Moneyball as a companion book. Lewis (author of \\"Liar's Poker\\") uses Wall Street trading as an analogy to explain why the Oakland As baseball team is one of the successful teams with much less money than most. But I also see an analogy relevant to the topic of Six Sigma. \\"Moneyball\\" also shows how one can achieve superior results by testing what everyone thinks they know with fact gathering and rigorous analyses. \\"Moneyball\\" may prove to be an inspiring book for those about to measure processes and look for opportunities for dramatic improvement: precisely what Six Sigma practitioners SHOULD be doing.	2004-01-08

It will give you the basic \\"tools\\" of Six Sigma in a compact, useable form. I feel that this would be an excellent text for corporate training on Six Sigma, certainly for an introductory course.<br />A quick read of the reviews on Amazon will give you a feel for why people are skeptical of 6 Sigma: the feel-good tone of most writing on 6 Sigma and the insistence that it \\"is not a flavor-of-the-month management trend\\" make many of us suspect that 6 Sigma is not much more than hollow jargon and acronyms. <br />Lets accept that these criticisms are valid and further that many \\"practitioners\\" are just self-aggrandizing or worse.

What a corporation does by accepting Six Sigma is that it empowers people to gather data to challenge what \\"everybody knows\\". Most importantly, it sets a very high quality standard, which reinforces the sanctioning of data-driven change.<br />The authors of \\"What is Six Sigma\\" put it very well early on: \\"proactive management means making habits out of what are, too often, neglected business practices: defining ambitious goals and reviewing them frequently, setting clear priorities, focusing on problem prevention rather than firefighting, and questioning why we do things instead of blindly defending them.\\"<br />I feel that the greatest flaw in Six Sigma is that many practitioners and even the books permit the basics to be lost in the shuffle. If one listens to people talk about Six Sigma, its easy to forget that a critical part of Six Sigma is that the data comes first, not the solution. I often hear co-workers say \\"we need to finish this project to improve our six sigmas\\" or \\"if we could get rid of this server we'll all get our green belts\\".<br />The term Six Sigma is derived from statistics and many books gloss over the statistics and move right on to basic project management techniques or how to overcome objections to Six Sigma. This book gives a clear and brief explanation of how to calculate standard deviations and includes a handy table to help with determine \\"sigma levels\\". Every Six Sigma book should respond to the challenge raised by this book and also include this information in the first 10 pages.<br />Finally, I recommend this book because it is concise and to-the-point. I feel that the fluff and/or Machiavellian advice in many of the other books just feed into people's healthy skepticism and distract people from the beauty of Six Sigma: the challenge to strive for near-perfect quality and the sanction to use statistics to cut through the inertia in our work lives.<br />I would also recommend Michael Lewis' \\"Moneyball\\" (ISBN 0393057658) as a companion book. Lewis (author of \\"Liar's Poker\\") uses Wall Street trading as an analogy to explain why the Oakland As baseball team is one of the successful teams with much less money than most. But I also see an analogy relevant to the topic of Six Sigma. \\"Moneyball\\" shows how one can achieve superior results by testing what everyone thinks they know with fact gathering and rigorous analyses.

There are so many names and so many details. When I read the Killer Angels, I found I had a little bit of trouble following who was who. Afterwards, when I visited the battlefield I realized I had imagined the battlefield a bit incorrectly.<br />That was a little more than ten years ago. Now I read about the Civil War like some follow soap operas. I'm no longer overwhelmed with detail and I enjoy rereading familiar events from slightly different points of view. The Killer Angels had helped me along quite a bit. After all, half the war was before Gettysburg and half was afterwards, giving me a nice way to organize. <br />But this book was also very helpful. While the National Park Service map provides an excellent tour, so does this book. It also breaks down the action into appropriate time intervals.<br />I particularly recommend this book to those who've read Killer Angels and want to read it again or read more on Gettysburg. Lots of details will fit into place.	2003-12-16

It would be a nice inexpensive gift for someone who likes the Sierras, particularly someone who has not gotten around to visiting these parks yet.<br />Many of the items a regular tourist can see in these parks is pictured, including some of the Sequoia trees and Mount Whitney (from the east). This magazine-sized booklet also includes many pictures of the spectacular Sierra High Country in Kings Canyon that can only be reached after 2-3 days of hiking, including Dusy Basin, Rae Lakes and Evolution Valley. The pictures are good enough to give you a feel of what you'd see in the high country, but the picture of Rae Lakes, one of my favorite spots, does not do the spot justice. Perhaps no photograph can.<br />King Canyon is a Rodney Dangerfield among national parks. While I lived in California, I noticed that relatively few people have heard of it. The Grant Grove entrance is exactly 250 miles from San Francisco and I dare say that many people have driven through the entrance on their way to Sequoia National Park without realizing they were in another park. Most people coming from a distance will not even consider visiting Kings Canyon when the more famous Yosemite is a bit more accessible.<br />Kings Canyon was founded in 1940, but upon its creation absorbed one of the first national parks, General Grant National Park, which was founded in 1890. While Kings Canyon is the deepest canyon in the United States, its no Grand Canyon. And visiting Kings Canyon is no substitute for visiting Yosemite. Kings Canyon (and Sequoia) are best savored by hikers in the know who'll gladly hike for days to see alpine scenery most people will never experience.<br />The largest wilderness unbroken by roads in the lower 48 states extends from Cedar Grove in Kings Canyon to the popular Yosemite Valley. The John Muir Trail(which includes perhaps the most beautiful section of the Pacific Crest Trail) extends in this wilderness. Any person who enjoys multi-day hikes should consider hiking in Kings Canyon.<br />This is no coffee table book, but the quality of the paper and the pictures is very good for the price.	2003-12-15

To loan to users<br />You are perceived to be a UNIX guru. People regularly come to you with great deference to ask you for advice and help. Someone apologizes for his/her lack of knowledge for the third or fourth time and asks about a basic command. You grab a thin book from the shelf. \\"Take a look at this book\\", you say, \\"You probably know most of what's in here, but maybe some of it will help you. Just give it back when you're done.\\" With relief he/she clutches the book and thanks you several times. He/she almost bumps into your neighbor's cubicle wall as he/she walks away reading this book... <br />Buy this thin book and this may happen to you. Well, the first part you'll have to manage yourself, but no self-styled UNIX novice has been ungrateful to borrow this book. Anyone seen as a guru will find that this book will pay for itself as a time-saving loaner. <br />I must say, that perception plays a great deal in this case. The book is amazingly thin and sports an O'Reilly animal on the cover. Anyone in corporate IT will associate this book with the O'Reilly books the in-house experts have on their shelves. I have another book that I feel may be a bit better for UNIX beginners, but given a choice, people will grab this one. <br />One can't help but notice sections that are probably unnecessary for computer-savvy UNIX beginners, such as \\"working with a mouse\\" and the description of a directory structure. But these sections are brief and clear and the authors move on quickly to UNIX-specific items such as \\"Redirecting I/O\\".<br />I definitely prefer \\"UNIX: Visual QuickStart Guide\\" from Peachpit Press, so I'm compelled to give this book less than a perfect score. I must admit that people who borrow this book seem much more enthusiastic when they borrow it than when they return it.

Details that did not make their way into the books that summarize campaigns (or the entire war) pop up like Easter eggs. When you read a particularly outstanding account, like this one, there's also the pleasure in reading often-quoted descriptions in their original context. <br />This collection of a Union staff officer's letters to his wife is a primary source of detail about the Grant versus Lee period of the American Civil War (1864-5). The author, Theodore Lyman, was on Meade's staff for roughly the last 18 months of the war and his letters give us an insider's view from the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac. <br />A Civil War buff interested in this period of the war will find this book not only very interesting, but a fun read as well. <br />Lyman, a biologist, met Meade, an engineer, in Florida, where Lyman was collecting specimens and Meade was building a lighthouse. They remained friends and during the war, after one of Meade's promotions before Gettysburg, he offered Lyman a position on his staff. Lyman joined immediately before the Mine Run campaign. His letters comment on the period of the Army of the Potomac's impotency in the months after Gettysburg to Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House. He writes about Grant's arrival, the Wilderness campaign, Petersburg and the Appomattox campaign.<br />Lyman, well educated and well traveled, makes many interesting observations and passing references that add color to the reader's knowledge of the period. I was under the impression that \\"doughboy\\" originated in WWI, but Lyman uses it in 1863: \\"There was a piercing cold wind, the roads were frozen, and ice was on the pools; but the night was beautiful, with a lovely moon, that rose over the pine trees, and really seemed to me to be laughing derisively at our poor doughboys.\\" <br />Lyman's extensive travels with his wife before the war led to his making many interesting comparisons. For example: \\"Our people are very different from the Europeans in their care for the dead, and mark each grave with its name; even in the heat of battle.\\"<br />Most enjoyable for me is Lyman's clever and often amusing phrases, such as this reference to Shakespeare's MacBeth: \\"...so I was up at 4:30 - rain pitchforks! Dark as a box - everything but `enter three witches.'\\"<br />Lyman's letters are sprinkled with mentions of secondary Civil War figures such as this of the man who later teamed with his father to build the Brooklyn Bridge: \\"Captain Roebling, from General Warren's staff, galloped up. He is the most immovable of men, but had, at that moment, rather a troubled air. He handed a scrap of paper. General Meade opened it and his face changed. `My God!' he said, `General Warren has half my army!' Roebling shrugged his shoulders.\\"<br />Lyman's descriptions give a lot of color to the war. Here are two more examples of what you can expect from this book:<br />\\"The houses that have not actually burnt usually look almost worse than those that have: so dreary are they with their windows without sashes, and their open doors, and their walls half stripped of boards.\\"<br />\\"Headed by General Webb, we gave three cheers, and three more for General Meade. Then he mounted and rode through the 2d and 6th Corps. Such a scene followed as I can never see again. The soldiers rushed, perfectly crazy, to the roadside, and there crowding in dense masses, shouted, screamed, yelled, threw up their hats and hopped madly up and down! The batteries were run out and began firing, the bands played the flags waved. The noise of the cheering was such that my ears rang. And there was General Meade galloping about and waving his cap with the best of them! Poor old Robert Lee!\\"<br />Lyman's letters have been a gold mine for historians. Someone well read in civil war histories will recognize at least a few some of his descriptions, such as this one of Grant: \\"He habitually wears an expression as if he had determined to drive his head through a brick wall, and was about to do it.\\" His description of Custer is also memorable: \\"This officer is one of the funniest looking beings you ever saw, and looks like a circus rider gone mad! He wears a huzzar jacket and tight trousers, of faded black velvet trimmed with tarnished gold lace.\\"<br />Its very difficult to find the perfect gift for the fanatic. After all, what could you get a fanatic that he doesn't already have? When I am buying a gift for a Civil War buff who has not yet discovered first-person accounts, this is my first choice. I am writing this review in the hopes that someone will give this book (sections of which I've reread many times) to that hard-to-buy-for Civil War buff on their gift list. <BR>petervtamas@mail.com	2003-12-13

There's the backyard birder who enjoys feeding and otherwise attracting birds to his/her backyard. Then there's the lister, who keeps a list of species seen (whether in a time period such as a year or in a lifetime) and is always trying to see the next new bird. I feel that among listers there are several types, some who chase the rare (pronounced \\"lost\\") birds that blunder to a \\"migrant trap\\" near the birders' home, and others who'd rather travel to where the birds should be. This book is for the later group.<br />There are quite a few bird finding books out there, many good but perhaps none of them perfect. Some of them give detailed lists of what can be seen at each location covered. This one does not. However, that's not necessarily a strong negative because some of the lists in the other books seem to list lots of rarities. If you follow the lists blindly, you may find yourself searching for rarities rather than what is common at that locale. <br />This book is first and foremost a book for daydreaming. Sure, the advice is practical and you get a good idea of what to expect at each location. But the scope of the chapters range from specific sanctuaries to countries. You may end up getting practical advice about an outstanding sanctuary not terribly far from you and start day dreaming about a trip to Kenya \\"someday\\". <br />If you are a bird watcher who likes to travel, you will probably enjoy this book very much. In fact, you don't need to be an expert birder to enjoy this book.	2003-12-10

The descriptions not only cover all you need to know to be prepared to hike a certain section, but there's lots of history and local color as well.<br />I've used this book successfully to plan hikes for a youth group. I must admit I disregarded the advice that a certain section (Knife's Edge) was not for those suffering from vertigo and sure enough, the group of kids I took on this section included one who suffered severely from fear of heights. But the kids worked together to get through that section and all was very well in the end.<br />This book is by no means dry. Sprinkled here and there are humorous passages, like the classification of vampire rocks versus jumping rocks. A pollution-damaged section is described as \\"shaved clean.\\" <br />An experienced hiker who has decided to hike section-hike or day-hike the trail between Harper's Ferry and the New York / Connecticut state line needs no other guide.

The photographer claimed that it was a picture of a confederate sharpshooter who had been mortally wounded during the battle. The soldier evidently made himself comfortable before he died. The sign explains that the photograph was staged, the soldier was not a sharpshooter and that the body was dragged some 40 yards to the spot. The sign credits William Frassanito with having made this discovery after careful study of Gettysburg photographs.<br />This is the book that describes this and many other pictures of the Gettysburg battlefield, many depicting dead men or horses. Many of these photographs are famous in the sense that they are used frequently in civil books and now in documentaries. Frassanito demonstrates convincingly that several of these frequently used photographs are mislabeled, generally to make the photographs seem more interesting and therefore more saleable. <br />Frassanito was an intelligence analyst during the Vietnam War and won the Bronze Star. I feel that only from a lot of practice analyzing photographs during the war could he have developed the skill needed to make the many clever observations in this book. Clearly, his wartime experiences left their mark in other ways as well. He frequently loses the detached air of a historian and reminds his readers of the horrors the subjects of the photographs must have experience. For example, he describes how rapid decomposition bloated the bodies immediately after the battle and how in some instances forced open the corpses' trouser buttons. \\"Thus the trousers on the soldier seen here were most likely open before his body was dragged to this position, the dragging action forcing them down below his hips. Here then was a young man who, only three days prior... full of life...But by July 5... was just another nameless corpse, his faced pressed against the earth, his exposed buttocks, once carefully hidden in accordance with the vanities of civilization, a sign of war's ultimate glory.\\"<br />This book has the potential to make you feel like an expert on the battle of Gettysburg. If you read this book, you will recognize misidentified photographs in even some of the best documentaries. Further, you will be able to find the locations most of these photos with the aid of this book, even those in less frequently visited portions of the battlefield.<br />I would recommend all of Frassanito's books to Civil War buffs, but this one above all. The section on the Rose Woods photographs is brilliant, more so than even the passage that earned a marker at Devil's Den.	2003-12-07

So, we usually have two bird guides with us and one of them is the Lone Pine field guide of the area.<br />The Lone Pine field guides all cover roughly 300 species with one page per species. A map showing where the species can be seen within the area covered by the field guide accompanies every description. <br />In some cases, the drawings of the birds are more accurate than that of the more comprehensive field guides.<br />This is my favorite of the Lone Pine field guides because in the description it also includes best sites to see the species. For example, for Snowy Owl, Toronto's Pearson International Airport is mentioned. So, this book is not only an excellent beginner/intermediate field guide, but also and excellent basic bird finder's guide as well.	2003-12-07

One is a full length of Lee standing in his best uniform hat in his right hand staring at the camera. If you know the story behind the photograph, you can see the fatigue in his eyes but also his fiery eyes that his contemporaries often mentioned. The one of Grant shows him leaning against a tree with his right hand, a tent behind him and his left hand on his hip. This photo is often used in documentaries when Grant's doggedness (bordering on stubbornness) is mentioned. <br />This book describes these and many other photographs of this period of the war, some frequently used, many others less so. The history of each photograph is described in careful detail. For example, you can read here that the Lee photograph was taken on his back porch, within a week of his having surrendered his army to Grant, probably on April 16. Frassanito also indicates that this photograph is part of a series taken in one session including photographs with Lee's staff officer (and biographer) Walter Taylor and Lee's eldest son Custis Lee. The photograph of Grant was taken near Cold Harbor and is part of a series of photographs taken of several generals and their staffs.<br />Other frequently used photographs are of a wagon train leaving Petersburg (often erroneously associated with Lee's withdrawal from that city, the dead southern soldiers in Petersburg's trenches and Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. Particularly interesting is the description of a series taken at Massaponax Baptist Church near the intersection of present-day route 1 and the road to the Spotsylvania battlefield. The pews had been taken out of the church to the yard and three photographs were taken of Grant, Meade and their staff officers while supply wagons rolled by in the background. Frassanito explains that Grant and Meade discuss a message brought by a cavalryofficer in one photo, Grant writes a dispatch in the second and all relax in the third. Frassanito even identifies the message that Grant probably wrote while the photograph was taken.<br />As in his other books, Frassanito explains how many of the photographs were misidentified over the years. Further, Frassanito always indicates when he's making an educated guess and why he made that guess. However, these errors are not as dramatic as the instances covered in his \\"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time\\". But they do give you further insight to this period of the war.<br />Frassanito was an intelligence analyst during the Vietnam War and won the Bronze Star. I feel that only from a lot of practice analyzing photographs during the war could he have developed the skill needed to make the many insightful observations in his books. <br />I would recommend all of Frassanito's books to Civil War buffs, but this one in particular to those interested in the last year of the war, the period where Grant and Lee faced off against each other in Virginia.	2003-12-07
US	50979524	R1K06KKLZSPJWI	1565108256	923683705	Readings on All Quiet on the Western Front (Greenhaven Press Literary Companion to World Literature)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Not Just for Scholars	The Greenhaven Press Literary Companion Series stated goal is to provide \\"an accessible resource for students researching America's and the world's greatest literary lives and works.\\" This collection of essays succeeds in providing thought-provoking essays on Remarque's \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" without being so challenging that only a scholar of literature would wish to read it. While this book is not for the average reader by any means, I feel that a motivated undergraduate or high school student with a strong interest in literature will find several articles of interest. Certainly someone who's enjoyed a few college courses in literature will find this collection of essays interesting.<br />If feel that an adult reader wanting to gain further understanding of the novel will enjoy this book more than a student. Certainly, the article \\"'All Quiet' is an immature novel of adolescent self-pity\\" will be more interesting to someone beyond his/her teens or twenties. I must point out that this novel was written at least in part as an attempt at therapy, so the self-pity critique may not be entirely fair. Perhaps the \\"self-pity\\" essay will inspire someone to write a book entitled \\"The Immature Jerk in Literature.\\" If so, I urge this reader to start looking for adolescent self-pity in \\"Red Badge of Courage\\", where this theme seems to be part of the author's intent rather than here, where it's a product of the author's genuine angst and the critics cynicism.<br />Ultimately, this collection says more about reactions to the novel than the novel itself. One essay is on how the author learned that he can empathize with a German. Another reflects reactions to Book of The Month Club's self-censoring the novel before releasing it. Literary analyses is also in the collection, such as \\"Paul Bäumer is a Christ Figure\\". <br />No one will agree with the conclusions of all the essays. Certainly \\"All Quiet is false and seditious\\" will not reflect the opinions of most readers ofthe novel. Certainly someone uninterested in critical thinking may not enjoy the selection. But someone who remembers the excitement of literature class in the distant past may enjoy this collection and reread some of these essays several times.	2003-11-15

S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien used to walk together, the coffee shop where J. K. Rowling began her work on the Harry Potter series, the house that inspired the Borrowers, the locations of The 101 Dalmatians... <br />It is apparent from reading this book that the author spent a great deal of time researching the topics covered. The byline indicates that she spent a year with her family exploring England and Scotland. <br />Fans of the books covered will enjoy the brief (1-2 page) biographies and the descriptions of the locations. This is what some call an \\"armchair travel\\" book: you can enjoy it without ever traveling to the locations.<br />I can't comment on the accuracy, because I have not visited any of the locations described. This is not a slick travel book brimming with pictures; it's a soft-cover printed on relatively inexpensive paper. I enjoyed the biographies and site descriptions and I'm sure there are many others out there who will as well.	2003-11-12

Even wayside stops (picnic areas) are marked. In addition to the master index and national mileage chart, every state has at least a local mileage chart and index printed next to the map. <br />Thanks to the spiral binding, this atlas is easy to handle. Now that I have two road atlases with spiral binding I wonder why I bothered with road atlases without spiral binding. Not only is it easier to use, wear and tear is less because I'm not folding it back on itself.<br />There are also descriptions of \\"travel adventures\\" provided by discover.com. Not necessarily very practical, but does inspire a little day-dreaming. This is the same exact set of descriptions that's in the large-print American Map Road Atlas of US<br />I recommend this road atlas, but I prefer the large-print version. However, I doubt you'll find a better atlas in this format.<br />This atlas covers Canada and Mexico. However, as it only covers 1 page for most of the provinces and 2 pages for Mexico, you'll probably want additional maps when traveling in these countries.	2003-11-11

According to the back cover, \\"It consistently ranks No. 1 among the publications long-distance hikers take with them.\\" I have no doubt this is so. Its is a small book filled with easily accessed information condensed from the 11 official Trail guidebooks.<br />This book is essentially a long chart listing what a hiker will encounter along the Appalachian Trail with mileage listed to one-tenth mile exactness. For example, in a matter of minutes, you can determine, that the distance along the trail from Pennsylvania route 309 to Hawk Mountain Road is 11.5 miles. If you wish to plan a hike on the Trail in, say, New Jersey, you simply find the NJ border (marked as 97.8 miles from NY/CT border and 63.1 miles from the PA/NJ border) and read down until you find a section that meets your needs. The locations of springs, shelters, privies, roads and other landmarks are listed in the order you will encounter them. For the hikers who need re-supply information, restaurants, stores and post offices (with zip code to send yourself supplies) are included.<br />Gleaning the same information from a normal guidebook will take much longer. Also, a normal guide book may be geared to day hikes while the reader of this book will be concerned more with multi-day hikes requiring springs and spots that the Trail crosses a road. This guide will help you consider starting/ending points other than that picked by the authors of the day-hike guide books.<br />On a recent (October 18, 2003) hike, I noticed a group of teenaged boys and a frustrated-looking adult. They had been unable to find the Eckville shelter. Their guide had indicated it was .2 miles along the trail southbound from Hawk Mountain Road. This guide indicated it was .2 miles EAST, rather than associating a specific mileage. The terse but accurate information in the Data Book helped us to find the shelter (its along Hawk Mountain Road east bound, downhill, from the trail).<br />If you need detailed descriptions of the Trail, you should consider the \\"Exploring the Appalachian Trail\\" series from Stackpole books, such as the one covering Maryland, PA, NJ, and NY by Scherer and Hopey. But even with that excellent guidebook, I found I referred back to the Data Book frequently and carried a photocopied page of the Data Book with me while hiking.<br />Note that this book will not describe the difficulty of a specific section of the trail. For that you will need other sources of information as well. On the other hand, if you frequently hike sections of the Appalachian Trail and will purchase more than one book on the topic, you will find this to be well worth its inexpensive cost.	2003-11-09

Not everyone who spends a lot of time reading about American politics will find this book very informative, but for someone casually interested or for a young adult, this will be an excellent read.<br />Hatch describes how a Senator goes about passing or defeating legislation. Particularly interesting is his description of the defeat of labor law reform in 1977.<br />Senator Hatch comes across as very reasonable throughout his book. His description of his friendship with Ted Kennedy is an excellent example of how and why professionals should be able to work together and even be friends even if they choose to disagree about topics they hold to be important.<br />Fans of Clinton and opponents of some Republican nominees to the Supreme Court may find this book tiresome in parts. But a liberal who wishes to read the point of view of someone who disagrees on these issues will enjoy  this book because of Hatch's reasonable, thoughtful approach. Conservatives will, of course, enjoy this book and may consider giving this book to as a gift to provide a good example to young adult readers.<br />petervtamas@mail.com	2003-11-07

The title may appear, at first glance, to be a typo. It is not. As the authors explain on the first page: \\"Sign refers to all the possible signs of their passing: sign of feeding, gathering material for nesting, the nests or cavity holes themselves, pellets, droppings, feathers lost during molt, or kill sites.\\"<br />This book appears to be packed with too much information for a beginner to digest. But its actually quite good for anyone who is interested in birds and would use such a book more than once or twice. The information is organized by types of sign - tracks, feathers, feeding signs, droppings, nests and roosts, etc., rather than by species. This allows you to read about whichever subject you're interested in and to take in the basics behind, say, interpreting signs of feeding, rather than getting bogged down by details specific to a certain species.<BR> <BR>Due to the nature of the topic, the squeamish may not enjoy all the pictures. However, the pictures are certainly not as gruesome as they could have been.<br />In the introduction, one of the authors writes: \\"real tracking is bigger than one lifetime. Tracking, as our ancestors knew it, was a body of knowledge handed down from generation to generation. Each person added to this knowledge...\\" The authors clearly see themselves as a continuation if this process, referring to and giving credit to other excellent books, such a Rezendes' \\"Tracking and the Art of Seeing\\". <br />To my knowledge, this is the only book like this specific to birds. I feel this would be an excellent gift idea for that hard-to-buy-for bird watcher.<br />petervtamas@mail.com	2003-11-07

This is a decent, enjoyable biography of the author of \\"All's Quiet on the Western Front.\\" I originally acquired this book because I saw quotes from Remarque's \\"The Road Back\\" in a book on posttraumatic stress syndrome (Shay's \\"Odysseus in America: Combat Trauma and the Trials of Homecoming\\"). I decided to read about and from Remarque, which led me to this biography.<br />Remarque wrote \\"In Westen Nichts Neues\\" in 5 weeks with the aid of large quantities of caffeine and tobacco. At this point, he was discouraged by the commercial failures of his first two novels and did not realize he had a future in writing.  Remarque just put the manuscript away, with \\"no idea of the bombshell waiting to detonate in the desk drawer to which he had consigned his new manuscript.\\" When he did publish it, it was an immediate success and was published in America under the more well-known name \\"All's Quiet on the Western Front\\". (I have read speculation elsewhere that the American title was based on the frequent Civil War era newspaper line \\"all's quiet along the Rappahannock.\\")<br />Remarque is a much better-known author than many realize. The Nazis were forever trying to use him for propaganda purposes. At the beginning, his books were burned. Later, the Nazis offered to give Remarque a prominent government role if he would just move back from Switzerland to Germany. Remarque's not only declined the Nazi's offer, he kept a suitcase packed most of his life so he could leave at a moment's notice.<br />As the Nazis gained power, Remarque left Europe for America. He worked in Hollywood for some time, mostly as a writer, but also playing a small but significant role in the film of his novel \\"A Time to Love and a Time to Die.\\"<br />A large portion of the book is about Remarque's personal life. He dated an astonishing number of Hollywood actresses, and had a friendship with Marlene Dietrich until the end of his life.<br />My only disappointment is the gossipy feel of large sections of the book. Remarque's alleged impotence is mentioned entirely too often. The author quotes one of Remarque's friends, Luise Rainer: \\"I don't believe for one moment that he was impotent. It would be just like Erich to say that. A joke. One reason I think he didn't totally go for me in those days was that he liked demanding women and I didn't come into that category. I distinctly remember him telling me, with the greatest glee, how Lupe Valez had... taken off one of her shoes in an tantrum and hit him hard with it, and he thought that was wonderful.\\" Remarque also allegedly impregnated a famous starlet while she was married to someone else. You don't need to dwell on his alleged impotence any more than this.<br />In contrast, the author mentions that Remarque's childhood friend Kristen Kranzb&uuml;hler was the model for Western Front's Kemerich. If some effort had been put into describing why scholars believe this, that would have been more interesting and more valuable than explorations of alleged impotency.<br />I predict that someday we'll have a much better biography of Remarque. This one is an interesting and memorable read and held my attention during my commute. The author does not pretend to write a book on literature. This is written for general audiences and he succeeds. Had the author not dwelled on Remarque's sexual life so much, I'd recommend it for teenaged readers who wanted a biography to dovetail with \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\".<br />petervtamas@mail.combook.

I wish I had had a copy on my cross-country trip earlier this year.<br />The large scale and large type edition gives a lot of detail without being cluttered or overwhelming.

Even Rhode Island and Delaware have two pages each.<br />In addition to the master index and national mileage chart, every state has at least a local mileage chart and index printed next to the map. Almost every right-hand page has one. The large type makes it easy to read in a moving car, even if its dark outside and you're reading by the car's light or a flashlight. <br />Thanks to the spiral binding, this atlas is easy to handle. Now that I have two road atlases with spiral binding I wonder why I bothered with road atlases without spiral binding.

US	50979524	R1C2OJHXRQ4DY4	0803279353	527224873	With Grant and Meade from the Wilderness to Appomattox (Bison Book)	Books	5	12	12	N	N	One of the Best First Person Accounts of the Civil War	First-person historical accounts can be a lot of fun for the frequent reader of history. Details that did not make their way into the books that summarize campaigns (or the entire war) pop up like Easter eggs. When you read a particularly outstanding account, like this one, there's also the pleasure in reading often-quoted descriptions in their original context.<br />This collection of a Union staff officer's letters to his wife is a primary source of detail about the Grant versus Lee period of the American Civil War (1864-5). The author, Theodore Lyman, was on Meade's staff for roughly the last 18 months of the war and his letters give us an insider's view from the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac.<br />A Civil War buff interested in this period of the war will find this book not only very interesting, but a fun read as well.<br />Lyman, a biologist, met Meade, an engineer, in Florida, where Lyman was collecting specimens and Meade was building a lighthouse. They remained friends and during the war, after one of Meade's promotions before Gettysburg, he offered Lyman a position on his staff. Lyman joined immediately before the Mine Run campaign. His letters comment on the period of the Army of the Potomac's impotency in the months after Gettysburg to Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House. He writes about Grant's arrival, the Wilderness campaign, Petersburg and the Appomattox campaign.<br />Lyman, well educated and well traveled, makes many interesting observations and passing references that add color to the reader's knowledge of the period. I was under the impression that \\"doughboy\\" originated in WWI, but Lyman uses it in 1863: \\"There was a piercing cold wind, the roads were frozen, and ice was on the pools; but the night was beautiful, with a lovely moon, that rose over the pine trees, and really seemed to me to be laughing derisively at our poor doughboys.\\"<br />Lyman's extensive travels with his wife before the war led to his making many interesting comparisons. For example: \\"Our people are very different from the Europeans in their care for the dead, and mark each grave with its name; even in the heat of battle.\\"<br />Most enjoyable for me is Lyman's clever and often amusing phrases, such as this reference to Shakespeare's MacBeth: \\"...so I was up at 4:30 - rain pitchforks! Dark as a box - everything but `enter three witches.'\\"<br />Lyman's letters are sprinkled with mentions of secondary Civil War figures such as this of the man who later teamed with his father to build the Brooklyn Bridge: \\"Captain Roebling, from General Warren's staff, galloped up. He is the most immovable of men, but had, at that moment, rather a troubled air. He handed a scrap of paper. General Meade opened it and his face changed. `My God!' he said, `General Warren has half my army!' Roebling shrugged his shoulders.\\"<br />Lyman's descriptions give a lot of color to the war. Here are two more examples of what you can expect from this book:<br />\\"The houses that have not actually burnt usually look almost worse than those that have: so dreary are they with their windows without sashes, and their open doors, and their walls half stripped of boards.\\"<br />\\"Headed by General Webb, we gave three cheers, and three more for General Meade. Then he mounted and rode through the 2d and 6th Corps. Such a scene followed as I can never see again. The soldiers rushed, perfectly crazy, to the roadside, and there crowding in dense masses, shouted, screamed, yelled, threw up their hats and hopped madly up and down! The batteries were run out and began firing, the bands played the flags waved. The noise of the cheering was such that my ears rang. And there was General Meade galloping about and waving his cap with the best of them! Poor old Robert Lee!\\"<br />Lyman's letters have been a gold mine for historians. Someone well read in civil war histories will recognize at least a few some of his descriptions, such as this one of Grant: \\"He habitually wears an expression as if he had determined to drive his head through a brick wall, and was about to do it.\\" His description of Custer is also memorable: \\"This officer is one of the funniest looking beings you ever saw, and looks like a circus rider gone mad! He wears a huzzar jacket and tight trousers, of faded black velvet trimmed with tarnished gold lace.\\"<br />Its very difficult to find the perfect gift for the fanatic. After all, what could you get a fanatic that he doesn't already have? When I am buying a gift for a Civil War buff who has not yet discovered first-person accounts, this is my first choice. I am writing this review in the hopes that someone will give this book (sections of which I've reread many times) to that hard-to-buy-for Civil War buff on their gift list.<br />petervtamas@mail.comn expression as if he had determined to drive his head through a brick wall, and was about to do it.\\" His description of Custer is also memorable: \\"This officer is one of the funniest looking beings you ever saw, and looks like a circus rider gone mad!
