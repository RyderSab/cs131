A fascinating read for those who have been following this story for the past 30+ years.  The reader, like Woodward himself, may be somewhat frustrated by the \\"one that got away;\\" i.e. the \\"why\\" of the story.  Why did Felt share this information with a newspaper.  Was he afraid to do so?  Did he have a vendetta against Nixon and Nixon's paranoid circle?  Did he no longer trust justice officials?  We may never know, unless it is to be discovered that Felt kept detailed diaries of this time.  Unfortunately, dementia or extreme memory loss has taken the story away from Deep Throat himself.<br /><br />Woodward's telling of this story is his most personal writing to date.  He speaks of self-doubt, self-questioning, and mistakes made, making this a very engaging story.  That differs widely from his other books.  Although extremely well-researched and well-documented, those books can, for those exact reasons, be somewhat dry.  He avoids \\"just the facts, Ma'am\\" and makes one of America's greatest mysteries a wonderfully human tale.	2005-08-15

It's an interesting installment, especially in this day and age, given the fear expressed within it about the crazy man who can fit an atomic bomb within a suitcase.  We also see Bond as the spy that Fleming was probably most familiar with:  deskwork, paperwork, target practice, etc.  It's not until midway through that Bond realizes he's involved in more than just a case of a card-cheat and instead involved in a case of a man who is trying to wipe out London.  And, so unlike the movies which followed, Bond is quite human, both in terms of getting beaten about by thugs, but also in not exactly having his way with his female counterpart.  A fun, well-paced read -- one of Fleming's most exciting plotlines -- and probably one of the most relevant Bond books fifty years after it was written.	2005-06-04

He captures the weirdness of the Yankee's season perfectly, in which one never quite knew whether Billy Martin was going to implode or not.  He captures the tension of the blackout-related looting and the fear surrounding the serial-killings of Son of Sam.  Looking back from this vantage point, it's somewhat amazing how far back from the brink NYC has come.  Mahler chronicles the events of that time extremely well, and is a wonderful storyteller.  My only question is:  to what end?  If he sees that year as a turning point, he was too subtle in discussing that significance.  The takeaway is that he simply saw it as an interesting year, with large events occurring simultaneously, with no relation to one another, and little relationship to the outside world as a whole.  If you were not there to witness -- or read about -- these events, you might say, \\"Interesting, but so what?\\"  What was missing from the end of this book -- which so many books similar to this have -- is a \\"where-are-they-now\\" section.  A coda such as that may have answered the question as to why these events and stories were significant and why we should care about them.	2005-05-20

I tripped across this book at our local library, picked it up and started reading it to my two sons, ages 8 and 10.  It's a book that is meant for out-loud reading.  Hamilton's prose is written in a very conversational tone, which mimics the way in which these southern tales were originally passed along:  orally.  Each story is about 3-4 pages long, with a lesson learned at the end of each one.  Birds and bats engage in ridiculous actions and we -- the humans -- can learn from them.  The book is as much fun to look at as it is to read, due to the beautiful artwork of the illustrator, Barry Moser.	2005-05-12

The beginning and ending -- the two parts which take place at Boot Magna in the English countryside -- are laugh-out-loud funny.  The middle section, which takes place with the protaganist, William Boot, in the mythical African nation of Ishmaelia, is more straightforward and serious.  The portions of the book which chronicle Boot's relationship with Katchen felt like they were torn out of a Hemingway book, given the sparse dialog and direct emotions.  I felt as if this book might have been started by a very young, impressionable Waugh during a time when he was experimenting with different styles, trying to find the one which best suited him... styles borrowed from Hemingway, Wodehouse, and Greene.  Its slightly disjointed nature made me think that it was a book which he worked on in fits and starts... would write a little, put it back in the drawer, revisit it a couple of months later.  Overall, it's a very good book by a writer a few years away from his peak.	2005-05-06

Henry Perowne is surrounded by a seemingly violent world -- he encounters madness at every step of his day:  an airplane on fire that may or may not pose a terroristic threat; a fender-bender that turns unnecessarily violent; a squash game that is fought too hard and could break up a friendship; a world that is about to launch a war that may or may not be necessary; and a break-in to his home that threatens his life as well as the lives of his loved ones.  This is the stuff that could add up to an act of violence by our protaganist, and McEwan, much like he did in Enduring Love, leaves it up to us to question not only Perowne's actions, but our own, as well.  What would we do in an operating theatre in which we find ourselves operating on the embodiment of our worst nightmares?  McEwan ultimately delivers to us a very redemptive and hopeful ending.   <br />With each book, McEwan's writing only becomes more captivating, taut, and eloquent.	2005-04-19

As always, his book is full of interesting anecdotes which support his primary premise.  But in Blink, unlike his terrific earlier book, The Tipping Point, Gladwell moves from reporting journalist to corporate keynote speaker wannabe.  He's got a central idea and he's going to prove it.  In Tipping Point, he moved from the other direction... he gathered a series of seemingly unrelated incidents and events and brought fascinating clarity to the reader.  It was excellent writing, research, and journalism.  But in Blink, I couldn't help but feel I was simply being sold a clever idea, something that seems terrifically obvious with a catchy name given to it.  I suppose it's somewhat like when Dylan went electric.  Some will like it.  Some will think he sold out.  But I have no doubt, he'll be extremely successful on his dinner circuit.	2005-04-13

And while the book is somewhat of a mystery -- is Joe imaging things or not? -- the true thread of the book has to do with doubt between loved ones.  The fact that Joe's wife actually doubts his interpretation of the book's opening events is what ultimately drives this narrative.  As a reader, I was fascinated by how McEwan was able to manipulate my interpretation of what I was reading.  For the first half of the book, I assumed that Joe's version of events was factual, and that Joe's wife, Clarissa, was merely being unsupportive.  About midway through, however, I began having my own doubts, much like Clarissa.  At the end of the book, we are left with the sense that the two of them will work to overcome this episode.  They have, in effect, had an epiphany by meeting with the widow of the man who was killed at the beginning of the book.  This woman, too, was wrongly filled with doubt about her husband.  Her statement that the only person who could forgive her is dead jars both Clarissa and Joe.  McEwan's writing, as in all of his books, is top-notch.  And while we may assume it was the opening balloon accident which pushes all subsequent action, it actually was Clarissa's doubt which proved to be the most damaging.	2005-04-10

Ackroyd is more than just an excellent writer and distiller of information.  He is clearly well-versed in the significance of Chaucer's writings and impact upon English literature.  I am one who greatly appreciates the fact that many lives can be elegantly presented in under 800 pages.  Ackroyd proves this point, bringing his slim volume in at 175 pages.  Generally, something would have to give in this smaller dosage, either Chaucer's other writings or a sense of the historical time in which the subject lived.

Either way, this is a wonderful, poignant story of a young man's first love and his questioning of faith.  Throughout the book, Thompson very effectively jumps back and forth between his childhood and his teen years.  Episodes in his life fold back on one another, with certain rhythms and patterns being formed.  His relationship with his brother, Phil, is wonderfully explored as is, obviously, his relationship with his first girlfriend, Raina.  Craig's sensitive treatment of his parents is admirable, given their seeming propensity for over-the-top Christianity.  I would offer up the observation that this memoir is to the world of graphic novels what Dave Egger's \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" is to the world of young man's memoirs.  Both were amazingly even-handed in their depiction of what could be considered difficult young lives.	2005-03-25

These versions make the assumption that not just words but phrases may seem somewhat arcane and difficult to comprehend.  The left-page notes are terrifically helpful in not only explaining meaning, but spelling out the context of the scenes as well.  In the back of each of these volumes are longer notes which can help the reader delve even deeper into historical context.  Most of the left-hand pages include illustrations and woodcuts from the era.  For those who read Shakespeare somewhat infrequently, these are probably the best versions on the market.	2005-03-05

Far more than a straightforward relating of what is known of Shakespeare's life, this biography delves into contemporary influences and how they may have played a part within Shakespeare's writings.  This book has been criticized for, perhaps, going too far down a conjectural path, which I, as a reader, was more than happy to go down along with Greenblatt. When he is taking us down a merely speculative road, Greenblatt very carefully qualifies his statements and properly justifies his suppositions.  My one fault with the book is the fact that Greenblatt relies too heavily on the context of Elizabethan England, making the assumption that certain themes that play out within Shakespeare's writings must indicate that he had to have experienced these themes himself, giving very little allowance for pure imagination.  Also seemingly missing from this comprehensive biography is the currently popular speculation of someone else having written, or co-written, the plays.  As a good companion piece to this biography, I would recommend Marchette Chute's \\"Shakespeare of London.\\"	2005-03-02

Biographies of Shakespeare are difficult in that there is so little known of his life.  This is unusual -- and somewhat ironic, given the subject matter -- when one takes into account the Elizabethan's propensity for journaling.  But Chute is able to place Shakespeare firmly within his time, making few assumptions, but presenting the known facts of Shakespeare's life in a lively and fascinating manner.  She strongly establishes the assumption that Shakespeare was considered one of London's finest actors and also places context around the performance of the plays.  What is most fascinating is how Chute gives a glimpse into the contemporary response to Shakespeare's writings.  While Shakespeare's \\"competitors\\" -- that is, his contemporary playwrights -- may have appreciated the breadth and scale of his writing, to a certain extent, they looked down upon the popularity of his plays.  Just like today, the so-called elite of our society tend to overlook those writings or performances that are appreciated by a mass audience. <br />Where Chute falls down somewhat is that, like so many biographers, she over-apologizes for her subject.  In Chute's vivid description, Shakespeare, seemingly, could do no wrong.  Time and again, Chute refutes the contemporary criticisms that were made of Shakespeare's writings.  Fault can be found in geniuses, as well as hacks. <br />Her book ends perhaps one chapter too late.  After Shakespeare was finished professionally, he retired to a quiet life in Stratford.  The only extant writing that refers to Shakespeare's final years are lawsuits that appear with his name.  While it does give a minimal sense of Shakespeare's activities, it does not make for very interesting reading and, in fact, places an overemphasis on perhaps meaningless records.  But this minimal criticism aside, Chute's book overall gives a wonderful sense of a fascinating person living in a fascinating time.	2005-01-23

Slightly sluggish, somewhat bloated, \\"Scribe\\" is surprisingly slower than \\"Stealer\\", despite the opportunities for high drama given the subject matter.  The main character, Widge, discovers the man who may -- or may not -- be his father.  As he did in his first volume, Blackwood offers Widge a number of moral dilemmas which make for very interesting reading for the target audience, young teens.  As a father who read this book out loud to his two sons, I appreciate the historical accuracy of Elizabethan England that Blackwood includes, incorporating issues of poverty, starvation, and the Plague, all of which were prevalent during this time.  With a little tighter editing and about 30 fewer pages, this could have been a stronger overall effort.	2005-01-08

Twenty-first century, because it recognizes the true grey of life, as opposed to the black-and-white manner in which Conan Doyle wrote during the Victorian era.  I would contend that Chabon is one of America's most interesting writers.  He continues to explore the power of the written word.  In the Final Solution, the \\"old man\\" -- presumably Holmes, though never named -- makes the realization that a solution to a problem may not be quite as important as other things, such as making a small boy happy by returning his one joy in life, a parrot.  Although the old man comes close to figuring out the import of a parrot's recited string of numbers, he realizes that that solution will not ultimately make the world a more orderly or sane place.  But what is important is the smile on his small companion's face upon the parrot's return.  Joy and happiness are, indeed, a final solution far more important than the cold logic of a puzzle solution.  Chabon's writing style has never been stronger, with each sentence bearing repeated readings.  Given Chabon's strong writing style and excellent pacing, his best may be yet in his future.	2004-12-27

The story is surprisingly effective, in that the reader is not entirely certain of what direction the plot is going.  This slim book -- little more than an elongated article -- is pure, forced action.  One event closely follows another.  What I enjoyed about it is the series of moral dilemmas offered up to the reader.  Should Auggie have turned in the thief?  Was it a wise choice to visit the thief's home?  Should he have stayed with the grandmother?  And should he have taken the camera that he found in the bathroom?  If he had not done any of these actions, then we would not have today the collection of Auggie Wren's a-picture-a-day.  Does the end justify the means?  I read this book to my two sons and had a very interesting discussion regarding the choices that Auggie made.  This book, in combination with Auster's \\"I Thought My Father Was God,\\" makes for worthwhile discussions around small, fascinating stories.  The beautiful illustrations by the artist ISOL merit close study.	2004-12-18

Roth is no Dickens... he refuses to supply the reader with a tidy wrap-up at the end.  Roth readers are challenged not just by sentence structure, not just by plot, but also by a history of ambiguous endings.    Having said that, I don't believe -- as others readers seemingly do -- that The Plot Against America suffers from a \\"weak\\" ending.  Throughout the final two chapters, we know how the national political scene returns to \\"normal.\\"  Roth tells us so.  And while this is presented as an alternative history novel, it truly is just two-three years that diverge from the history we know.  The war still ends in 1945... Germany is still ultimately defeated... and Roosevelt -- President Roosevelt -- still dies in office just months before the end of the war.  This is all laid out.  So the value of the book comes from Roth's examination of a nation gone mad, that nation being America from 1940 to 1942.  And what is absolutely terrifying is how logically Roth presents the case for how easy it is for a nation to go down a horrible path, and how willing certain folks are to lead us down that path.    Although Roth denies it, I can't help but believe that he uses this incident as a metaphor for current-day America, a nation led by those who care not one ounce for certain sectors of our population, i.e. the poor, the elderly, [...] Americans, etc.  It's a long enough list.  And it's as that metaphor that makes this a brilliant book, and one of Roth's most powerful.  Certain lines could be lifted out of today's discussions:  p 65:  \\"... now they think they can get away with anything.  It's disgraceful.  It all starts with the White House...\\"  p 101  the narrator, asking his father why no one is doing anything about the creeping madness:  \\"What about the Democrats?\\" I asked.  \\"Son, don't ask me about the Democrats.  I'm angy enough as it is.\\"  p 229 (a Winchell speech) \\"There the right-wing saboteurs of democracy -- the so-called patriots and the so-called Christians -- can be turned against these isolated Jewish families overnight.\\"  On and on it goes.  One of the major points of Roth's book is how dangerous a nation can become when those in power rule only for their own special interests, at the price of those who are not in power.  It happened in Germany; in Roth's book, it happened in America.  But left unchecked, it can happen anywhere, anytime.	2004-12-18

I could not have picked a better series.  The book is extremly well-written, very much in the feel of a Robert Louis Stevenson adventure, both in tone and language.  It is clear that Blackwood did a fair amount of research into the life and times of Shakespeare.  Although the bard is by no means a central character in this first book of the series, he is a tangential figure.  And while there is a great deal of adventure and suspense within this novel, with each of the short chapters ending with a mild cliff-hanger, the beauty of the book comes in the main character's -- Widge's -- search for belonging and community.  By book's end, he finds it within the theatre, Shakespeare's Globe.  The book succeeds on many levels, not the least of which is giving the reader a good sense of what a player's life was like at the beginning of the 17th century.  While I, as an adult reader, thoroughly enjoyed how tightly written this novel was, it should be pointed out that my enjoyment spread to re-reading a couple of Shakespeare's plays, as well as some recently-issued biographies of the Bard.  Well done, Blackwood.	2004-11-27

I appreciated Cornwell's series for the simple fact that he avoids mysticism and fantasy.  Instead, Cornwell looks at the King Arthur legend more from an historical standpoint than a mystical one.  He takes the premise that Arthur very well could have been a real person, one who was trying to unite the Britons against the invading Saxons within a very realistic 6th century setting.  Of equal interest, especially in these days of the Bush administration, is the clash between the overbearing Christians and the diminishing pagans and Druids.  Of particular focus within this volume is the \\"final\\" battle between Arthur's army and the combined Saxon forces of Aelle's and Cerdic's armies.  As always, Cornwell puts the reader right in the middle of the action, so that we hear, see, and smell the battle going on around us.  This is a book to be enjoyed for both its historical and plotline aspects.	2004-11-16

And that's part of the problem with this classic.  There's an unnecessarily implausible happy ending that didn't need to occur.  Jim Dixon is the quintessential anti-hero.  Gliding through life at the campus, trying to succeed by not truly trying.  Skating through life; chasing the beautiful woman, Christine, partially due to the fact that it will annoy Christine's boyfriend, Bertrand; drinking too much at inappropriate occasions; being disrespectful to the department head, Mr. Welch, for no apparent reason other than he is Dixon's superior.  All of these ingredients make for a very funny book, but do not reasonably add up to the book's conclusion, which in my mind was the book's only flaw.  Amis's writing is terrific, however, allowing the reader to get deeper into the mind of Dixon than most other books' primary characters.	2004-09-24

When I wasn't laughing out loud, I was, at least, chuckling or smiling.  As a true fan of Wodehouse and his Wooster/Jeeves creation, I went into this book somewhat skeptically.  But Ames does a perfect sendup with Alan Blair and his \\"companion,\\" Jeeves.  There is one humorous vignette after another within this book, and, as in Wodehouse, no true overriding action.  But action is not the point... it's the silliness of the antics, situations, and conversation that Blair gets into that makes this a pleasure to read.   <br /> <br />This book belongs in the genre of helpless first-person lead male characters, who are able to somehow rationalize their troublesome actions to themselves, if not to others.  Read Tim O'Brien's \\"Tomcat in Love\\" and Michael Frayn's \\"Headlong\\" for other excellent contributions to this category.   <br /> <br />I suppose it would be too much to ask Ames for a sequel...  I suspect he's got his literary sites set on higher goals than repeating oneself would allow for.  But if you haven't yet read this book, you've got a treat in front of you.	2004-09-01

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	5	27	33	N	N	Insightful	Frank's book is a terrific insight, certainly, into what's going on in Kansas, but throughout America, as well.  He investigates something that has stymied many of us:  why is it that Bush and his cronies do so well in some of America's poorest counties (which happen to be in Kansas)?  A constituency which had, at one time, voted overwhelmingly for Democrats and what Democrats stood for, is now voting overwhelmingly for a party which doesn't give a whit for poor folks' concerns.  Why is there such self-denial going on here?  Frank concludes that, by and large, the reason comes down to the fact that the Republicans have grabbed the \\"values\\" issue and made it their own.  Not that they have any intention of altering the course of our culture.  They don't.  In fact, solving the cultural issues of the day (abortion, Hollywood values, prayers in public schools, etc.) is less beneficial to them than continually beating the drum over these issues and whipping up the passions of this motivated and directable subset of our population.  Perhaps better than any of the current crop of political books floating about out there, \\"What's Wrong With Kansas?\\" sheds light on the current divisiveness within our culture.	2004-08-20

Brooks, who has been criticized for walking too deeply into the Blue State-Red State controversy, avoids using this political terminology, but, as usual, has little problem with throwing around gross generalizations.  But, in the case of this book, it works.  Brooks is attempting to step back - WAY back - so as to look at the whole forest.  He is not interested in the trees, per se, and, because of that, the reader does not mind his attempt at breaking down Americans into six or seven distinct socioeconomic and cultural distinctions.   <br /> <br />His purpose is to provide us with a snapshot overview of the way we live today.   And, if you're unfamiliar with Brooks's writing, you may not have a sense of where he falls on the political spectrum.  He is quite equal in his disdain and tweaking of the liberal and conservative lifestyles.  But is it enough for a book?  Maybe, maybe not.  The book starts out by breaking us down geographically, that is, by where we live in relation to large cities.  Are we urban core-dwellers, first-ringers, second-ringers, or exurbanists?  The second half of the book looks primarily at the manner in which we live, raise our children, attend schools, and work.   Brooks's strength is his ability to cull random bits of information, statistics and anecdotes and put it together as a lively and entertaining portrayal of the American spirit.  His weakness is that, well, none of it is terribly original, as is witnessed by the long tracts of others' writings he includes throughout.  And, while he concludes that Americans are and always have been a driven and hard-working lot, one which is always looking toward the future, he never ventures into explaining why other cultures are not more like us, especially in this day and age of globalization.   <br />	2004-08-03

But, as Keillor says toward the end of this book, the hottest circle of hell is reserved for those who remain neutral during a time of crisis.  And so, he has put down his thoughts, for what they're worth, in this slim volume.  And for a life-long Democrat like myself, this makes for a wonderful read.  It is structured much like an extended conversation at Keillor's favorite St. Paul coffee shop.  Autobiographical for much of the first half, the second half is the portion that lays out the case against the current administration and, in turn, will prove to be the most controversial.  So many of us shake our heads at the daily absurdities and surreal proclamations that emanate from those within the Bush circles.  The cathartic powers of Keillor's book prove to be a healing respite to today's headlines.	2004-07-27

A book that ends in mid-stream, with the words \\"To be continued\\"?  This book contains a cardinal sin in publishing.  I have absolutely no problem with continuing action across several volumes, but like the Harry Potter series, at least make each of the volumes capable of standing alone.  There is absolutely no resolution at the end of this volume.  Maddening.  And if it was well-written, I would have at least given it 3 or 4 stars, the \\"to-be-continued\\" transgression notwithstanding.  But the author (\\"authors\\" if you count the child) repeats words within sentences and between sentences (those must have been the sentences written by the child) to maddening effect, relies heavily on trite statements and cliches, and has no sense of pacing.  It's as if someone sat down with a list of things children like -- \\"Well, they like circuses, they like lions, they like big boats, they like choo-choo trains, they like chases, and they like kings!  Let's put together a book with all these ingredients!\\"  Although my two sons, ages 7 and 9, to whom I was reading this, are not bothered by repeated words and cliches, they were very upset with the pseudo ending. (\\"Keep reading!\\"  \\"Well, sorry boys, the only thing left are the acknowledgements.\\"  \\"Oh.\\")  Charlie and his silly escapades will have to be taken up by other readers.

No being nostalgic about it.  It's hell.  And Hedges does a terrific job examing its &quot;appeal&quot; to the human race.  This isn't a fun read, by any stretch of the imagination.  Hedges describes atrocities he has witnessed throughout the world, but primarily in Kosova.  War turns us into some form of sub-human species, but yet so many veterans refer to their time in a combat zone as the time they were the most alive.  Our leaders sell us on the notion of war much like Madison Avenue sells us on the appeal of the latest toothpaste.  At a certain point, we may wise up, but by then, it will no doubt be too late.  We'll have destroyed ourselves.  Hedges' book should be read by every member of Congress prior to giving any approval to an adventurous President's plans.	2004-06-24

There are some very interesting moments built within it, in particular the history of Florence (much of which, unfortunately is fabricated and compressed, as revealed during the Acknowledgement section) toward the end of the book.  This is not a mystery in which the reader is invited to play along, however.  We must simply take, at faith, the conclusions that two of the primary characters, Paul and Tom, arrive at throughout the book.  As a reader, I was somewhat frustrated upon finishing the book having absolutely no idea whether the riddles and mysteries described as being contained within the Hypnerotomachia are truly existent or if this is merely a fictional &quot;what-if&quot; conjured up by Caldwell and Thomason.  And if those riddles are truly existent, to what degree are they existent?  That is, just where does fiction diverge from fact?<BR>But the two authors can certainly write.  Given the subject matter, their pacing is quite good, they didn't overly-wallow in the love interest angle, and they had some interesting -- albeit, forced -- parallels between the action of the 15th century and the present day.  In fact, their most effective parallel may ultimately have been unintentional:  the one in which the rise of overly-zealous religious figures attempt to dominate humanists.<BR>All in all, not a bad first novel.  They guys may have the chops.  Let's see what their follow-up book is like.  After all, there does seem to be an opening for a sequel.	2004-06-21

If you can get past Fleming's assumptions that all blacks in America are somehow interconnected by a mysterious communications web, and Fleming's comfort in using the &quot;N&quot;- word, then you'll enjoy this second installment in the Bond series.  There's far more action than the first in the series, Casino Royale, what with Bond battling sharks and barracudas and whatnot.  A hair-raisingly scary episode takes place as Bond makes his way underwater to the golden lair of Mr. Big, but rest assured, dear reader, that our Mr. Bond makes it through to the end of the book, safe and alive, albeit without a chunk of shoulder muscle, but that's neither here nor there.  And wassup with Felix Leiter?  Does he have all his body parts or not?  Fleming kind of dropped the ball, so to speak, with letting us know whether or not Leiter was to survive for another adventure.  <BR>The Fleming series is undoubtedly addictive...

Sewell has written a timeless book.  It is an unusual book in that the main character is a talking horse, yet it's not positioned in the somewhat cartoon-ish manner that so many children's books with talking animals are.  Sewell attempts to place a subtle moral tale within each chapter.  She uses man's cruelty or kindness to animals as a lesson for how we humans should treat each other.  The overall message, essentially, is that if we are kind to animals, presumably, we will be kind to each other.  While the plotline moves at a gentle pace, there is enough action embodied within the overall story that it kept the attention of my two sons throughout.  A wonderful escapist read at any age.	2004-05-25

His profiles of Cheney, Powell, Rumsfeld, Rice, Armitage and Wolfowitz are extremely well-researched.  Mann uses numerous secondary resources, interviews with friends of the subjects, as well as interviews with the subjects themselves in order to create a well-rounded, balanced picture of Bush's advisors.  There is little doubt from this picture that Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Wolfowitz are the driving force behind our foreign policy, with Bush essentially acting as a figurehead for the neo-cons, and Powell being little more than a distraction to the overall plan (albeit a necessary appeasement to the moderate Republican faction).  <br />This is an important read for anyone who simply shakes his or her head in amazement at what is going on in the current administration.  By understanding the thought processes of this dysfunctional group -- whether one agrees with them or not -- we can at least have a modicum of understanding of their policies and actions.	2004-05-16

The narrator is looking back on a defining year in his life, a year in which he made a life-altering mistake.  It takes him approximately 40 years to redeem himself, and in his case, time is the ultimate healer.<br />This is in contrast to a minor character's fall from grace.  The headmaster of the private school has lived a lie.  And while he hasn't actually made misstatements about his life, he also hasn't corrected others' misperceptions about who he is and whom he knows.  In the end, he, too, is redeemed, but in a far different manner from the book's narrator.  The headmaster is redeemed through honesty, seemingly a much quicker route than the narrator's 40-year travail.<br />Wolff demonstrates two paths to redemption:  time and honesty.  He leaves it to the reader to determine which is ultimately more effective.  Wollf's writing style is somewhat reminiscent of one of the book's main characters, one who never actually shows up, but is referred to constantly:  Ernest Hemingway.  And as the book's characters are all-to-well aware, there could be far worse role models to be compared to.	2004-04-05

Two characters within this novel, one primary, the other secondary, go through a crisis of misrepresentation.  The main character, the narrator, misrepresents who he is through plagiarism.  Conversely, the headmaster misrepresents who he is through failing to correct the misperceptions of those around him.  His students and colleagues think that he has a stronger connection to Ernest Hemingway than he actually has.  Both, in the end, are redeemed.  With the narrator, it takes years to be able to be proud of who he is and what he has accomplished.  All of his actions following his plagiarism are aimed toward redemption.  His misdeed is what directs him.  The headmaster realizes that, although quite subtle, his misrepresentation is equally as bad and through terrific honesty over the course of a year, is able to come back \\"home.\\"  Wolff's writing is beautiful throughout this slim novel.  Like many of Hemingway's novels, not an unnecessary word is used.  Wonderful.	2004-03-31

Author Phillips has looked at 20th century American history through the eyes and actions of the Bush clan.  And it is, at times, a scary sight.  Phillips examines George H. W. Bush's influence upon four primary topics:  the CIA, the energy sector (primarily oil), national security, and foreign relations.  His son, George W., has introduced a new imprint upon these topics with his heavy involvement with -- and on-going courting of -- the religious right.  Many of these sectors come together in a dangerous and toxic mixture in the battlefields of Iraq.  Phillips forces the question:  Is this the type of leadership our country wants?  Do we want a leader who -- through on-going generational involvement -- is beholden to the agendas of various groups such as:  the fundamentalists, the oil producers, the richest one percent of our nation, the Saudis, or the CIA?  I suspect that Phillips, a Republican consultant, would say no. <br />Despite having read several books on 20th century history, as well as several biographies on leaders of that century, this book was a true learning experience for me.  It has, in a certain way, altered the way that I look at the world.  A higher compliment I would be unable to give to a writer.  <br />My one minor complaint about the book is that a bibliography section at the back would have been very helpful to the reader.  Phillips includes good documentation on his footnotes, but an overall topic bibliography would have been even more helpful.	2004-03-17

Unusual for a \\"children's\\" book author, Farmer brings up some issues within this story that merit thought and discussion -- primarily the issue of human cloning and a drug culture gone amok.  I read this book out loud to my two sons, ages 7 and 9.  The action scenes played well with my younger son while the ethical issues caused several questions to be asked by my older son.  And, although I feared a quick wrapup of the plot at the end, tying together all loose strings, Farmer resists this temptation, leading the reader to wonder just what Matt will do with his future.  Will he truly shut down Opium or will power go to his head (he is, after all, a clone of El Patron).  Farmer leaves the door open for a possible sequel, but fortunately, the reader is not left hanging from a cliff.  Well done!	2004-03-03

I had never heard of it and had no idea that it had been selected by the Today Show as a book club book.  In any event, I felt it was a terrific read.  The main character, an English teenager with Asperger Syndrome, is a totally sympathetic character.  Through a series of episodes, we are quickly able to understand the world in which he, Christopher, is trapped.  I had only a few complaints regarding the thrust of the action.  Christopher loses faith in his father for something his father did.  Granted, his father's actions were deplorable, but, perhaps, understandable, given his father's anger with Christopher's mother.  However, did Christopher write his father's actions off because of the on/off, black/white nature of his syndrome, or because Christopher is a teenager? To not know this answer diminished my experience as a reader.  And in terms of pacing, the first 90 percent of the book took place within a scope of days, the final ten percent in a course of months.  To me, it felt slightly lopsided.  Nonetheless, the wonderful writing style and peak into another world made this an entertaining and worthwhile read.	2004-02-24

I was happy I did so.  I enjoyed it far more than I had anticipated, thinking it had the strong potential to be extremely dated, given current political global realities (not to mention the realities of &quot;political correctness&quot;).  Having rarely dipped into the espionage genre, I suspect Fleming was one of the first Cold War spy writers, and from that aspect alone, it makes this an interesting read.  But the story, as well, is great fun.  This is NOT heavily character-driven stuff.  We don't know a great deal about this character, James Bond, from Fleming's writing, no delving into his childhood, why he became a spy, what motivates him.  None of the ingredients that LeCarre might include.  But perhaps that's the point.  Bond is a man of mystery, as deep and mysterious to the reader as he is to his compatriots.  The plot is a fun one: Bond must outlast the Soviet spy based in France, Le Chiffre, in a game of bacarrat.  Fleming's pacing and suspense are well doled out.  The chapters are short and the ending has a twist.  What could possibly be better on a cold winter's night.  Pass the gin and olives.	2004-02-18

Also unusual for a children's book is the fact that there are three distinct storylines that ultimately converge.  I also appreciate the fact that Dicamillo resisted the \\"happily ever after\\" ending that had been so foreshadowed throughout the book.  Not all characters get what they had been wishing for, but they get close enough.  In a world of children's books where so much is discussed in terms of black and white, it was refreshing to have this book explain the shades of grey to a child, which is, after all, more representative of life in general.  The dialogue of the characters is great fun, making this a terrific book to read out loud.  We should only hope that a stage version comes out of this wonderful text.  But the theatre would have to serve soup to everyone as they exit!	2004-02-09

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	4	35	42	N	N	An important read for 2004	Whether you are Republican or Democrat, this is a must-read for the upcoming election.  Very few surprises are contained within this book -- the biggest &quot;revelation&quot; seemingly being the fact that Bush and his pals were planning an overthrow of Hussein from Day 1.  This truly couldn't surprise many readers.  But what is of relevance is the description of how decisions are made and crucial topics are discussed, or, more to the point, not discussed, at least not in a broad and engaged forum, such as a Cabinet meeting.  And even though former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill is the prime source for this book, his portrayal by Suskind is not unblemished either.  It would seem that Bush and O'Neill brought out the worst in each other, with O'Neill trying to engage his boss in any way possible, including odd actions and statements.  O'Neill comes across, both in the book and in interviews post-publication, as being somewhat naive about the way Washington works.  This is truly surprising given his experience within the Nixon and Ford administrations.  The reading of Suskind's book is important for all engaged US citizens.  Rarely do we get a glimpse such as this within a current administration.  This, typically, is the type of information that comes out 5 - 10 years after a presidency.  Given the information O'Neill has shared with us, it is important that we evaluate carefully what type of administration we want occupying the White House.	2004-02-01

After reading the tight, well-paced \\"Thief Lord,\\" Funke's earlier book, I and my sons were eager to jump into \\"Inkheart.\\"  More words do not, however, necessarily mean a better story nor, seemingly, more action.  A 500+ children's book can be forgiven if there are twists and turns throughout, as well as numerous multi-dimensional characters.  But Funke's book is a pretty straightforward affair, all plot resolutions having been assumed from the get-go, and all characters (half a dozen primary ones) introduced right up front.  The translation from the original German felt somewhat rushed and weak.  There were several occasions in which words were needlessly repeated within a given sentence or neighboring sentences.  Also, the translator, Bell, didn't seem to realize that this children's book just might be read out loud to, well, a child.  Oftentimes, homonyms adjoined one another in a manner which confused my sons, to whom I was reading the book out loud.  All in all, this felt like a much-too-fast followup to the success of \\"Thief Lord.\\"  There's a terrific story here, but a rushed effort created unnecessary problems.	2004-01-19

The Caldecott honor is well-earned for Gerstein vividly captures the magic of this incident, both from the vantage-point of the observers on the ground as well as Petit's perspective from the wire.  I always worry when a wonderful illustrator is also the author.  All too rarely do the talents flow both ways.  But Gerstein keeps the prose to a minimum and the words push the action just as effectively as the illustrations.  There are two pull out illustrations, which very effectively demonstrate the length of the walk, as well as the height of the towers.  Gerstein also gives a nice -- and moving-- tribute to the towers in the closing pages.  During my first reading of the book to my sons, the two of them excitedly asked me, \\"Does he make it??\\"  After the final page, they both yelled, \\"Read it again!\\"  Better praised an author/illustrator couldn't receive.	2004-01-18

It works well on several levels... a well-paced page-turner... a look at the corrupting force of power... a literary work of historical fiction.  But what is perhaps most interesting is Cornwell's depiction of religious fanaticism.  The historical time depicted in &quot;Enemy of God&quot; is that transition between the polytheist world of paganism and the monotheist world of Christianity.  Traditions which, at this point, are second nature to Christians were quite new in AD 400 - 500.  Also, as Cornwell points out, Christianity was oftentimes embraced by those who had little to lose in their life.  Therefore, their desperation made them willing to sacrifice their lives for the promise of better things in the afterlife.  This mindset -- as it does today among religious fanatics of whatever ilk -- led to unnecessarily desperate acts during times of war.  After all, what did they have to lose?  Cornwell blends all of these facts together with a wonderful story.  He diverges from the more traditional Arthur/Lancelot relationship known through the current renditions of Camelot.  I look forward to the third -- and concluding -- volume of this trilogy.	2004-01-05

But Cornwell has written this as historical fiction, staying faithful to the feeling and events of the dark ages.  And in so doing, he elegantly wraps a literate page turner.  The characters are well-developed, and there is tension and suspense throughout, with a climactic battle scene second to none.  Cornwell paints a picture of the action scenes expertly, a difficult task for many authors. The action is told by Arthur's warlord, Derfel.  At the point of writing, Derfel is an old man, and is writing his story down for the sake of posterity, but primarily at the request of the young, beautiful queen, Igraine, who is fascinated by the legend of Arthur.  This is a device that works wonderfully, going back and forth between the remembrances of Derfel and the present-day discussion between the aged Derfel and Igraine, a somewhat flirtatious relationship.  Although I am eager to get my hands on the second volume of this trilogy, I also appreciate the fact that this is a terrific book that stands by itself.	2003-12-02

If a dysfunctional family can be described as one that keeps secrets from one another, then the Santerre family members have lots of therapy in their future.<BR>Meloy's well-crafted sentences make for a wonderful read.  Not a word is wasted.  Meloy uses the Catholic church as a background force -- either a guiding or a repelling one, depending upon which family member you are.

I happened to trip across it while browsing in a used book store in south Minneapolis.  There no doubt is a great deal of smiting and smoting betwixt the knights going on in this version, but dated language notwithstanding, my two sons thoroughly enjoyed my reading of this to them.  They loved the pure action contained within these tales, and the drawings at the beginning and ending of each chapter were terrific.  Of all the versions I've looked at of the King Arthur tales, this, I felt, was the most accessible and readable for audiences of all ages.  Too many versions contain language that is far too &quot;medieval&quot; or far too modern.  This strikes a nice balance.

It is an atypical \\"counting\\" book... one in which a certain object, in this case -- umbrellas, is added to each page.  But the twist is that a CD comes with this book.  The CD has various cuts of original piano music.  Each cut wonderfully reflects the setting of the given page.  On one page, as the umbrellas cross over a bridge, you can hear the plink-plink of the raindrops on the water below.  On another page, you can hear an approaching train as the pianist speeds up his delivery of original music.  The artwork is beautiful, with a subdued rainy palette used for backgrounds.  Only the umbrellas themselves are vibrantly depicted.  It's only at the end of the book in which we actually get a glimpse of the people (children) carrying the umbrellas, and even on that page, one only sees their legs.  My two sons enjoyed trying to guess who might be carrying the umbrellas and where they might be going.

Or, at least, it's journalism told from a slanted point-of-view.  As I read through this book, I became angrier and angrier with the leadership of our nation.  Ivins and Dubose tick off the areas in which Bush and his administration are ruining our nation.  Scary examples of environmental setbacks, insane fiscal policy, dictatorial foreign policy, too much political influence by Big Business, etc., play throughout the book.  I became convinced that the Bush administration is destroying our country and everything it stands for.  But then about half-way through, I realized the reason I was so angry was because at no point do we hear a rebuttal from the administration itself.  There has got to be reason that Christine Todd Whitman decided to do away with the ombudsman office within the EPA.  But danged if we could find out the reason, or even if Ivins or Dubose attempted to contact Whitman's office to hear their side of the story.  Don't get me wrong, I DO think Bush and his high-paying cronies are evil.  It's just that they need to have more of a voice in this book if it's aspiring to be anything close to journalism.  Even Al Franken, in his most recent book, contacted his intended targets for a response/rebuttal. I have absolutely no doubt that if Ivins and Dubose were to have given those within the administration a voice, they would have quickly hung themselves, so to speak.  There's no way the administration's representatives could have stood up to the heart-wrenching individuals who are the focus of each chapter.  Had there been more balance, this could have been a journalistic classic.	2003-10-15

Like any typical episode of Saturday Night Live during its &quot;Golden Age,&quot; some of these chapters soar; others barely get off the ground.  But overall, the book is a damn good (fun?) read.  Just at the point at which Franken seems slightly full of himself, he is able to pull back in a very self-deprecating way; e.g. the chapter in which he flagellates himself regarding his initially over-the-top support of the war could easily have been omitted, but Franken is willing to tweak himself as well as the radical right.  <BR>One can't help but feel a slightly guilty pleasure in seeing Franken call these radicals on their lies and false innuendos.  According to Franken, the tone that has been set by Messrs. Rove and Bush is frightening.  The lengths they will go to manipulate the population to the benefit of their cronies is more than frightening -- it's borderline felonious.  Being able to laugh at it is actually cathartic, and for that reason, Franken has actually done us a service.  Franken's conclusion, however, is that once we're done talking and laughing about the current administration's crimes, it will be time to get serious -- and vote.	2003-10-03

Isaacson has clearly done exhaustive research on Franklin's life and, fortunately for the reader, does not get lost in the minutiae.  Isaacson gives a wonderful sense of just who Franklin was and what he was like.  The reader is actually able to get to know this subject.  Some of his qualities are very likeable and admirable, others, such as his relationship with his family and relatives (with the exception of his sister), are not so admirable.  But Isaacson successfully avoids getting too close to his subject, and presents Ben with his &quot;warts and all.&quot;<BR>Isaacson also gives a very good sense of the times in which Franklin lived, a quality which is necessary for any good biography.  While understanding a subject's actions is important, it is perhaps even more important to understand the reasons behind those actions.  Isaacson wonderfully paints a picture for the reader of 18th century America.<BR>And then, finally, Isaacson, in his last chapter, explains how Franklin has been perceived throughout our nation's history, and why his reputation rises and falls.  It is a fascinating look at how important these Founding Fathers have become to us, in terms of using them as measuring sticks.  They have become our Rohrschach test, our archetypes.<BR>All in all, a splendid read.	2003-09-12

This was the version I purchased after reading dozens of fairy tales to my sons and began wondering why these tales have been so enduring -- or, endearing -- over the centuries.  Tatar's versions, along with her helpful introductions, helped me greatly understand why these stories have been handed down through the generations.  She brings in not only the historical context of several French and German fairy tales, but remains as faithful to the &quot;original&quot; version as possible, given the fact that these were primarily oral stories being told.  Of primary value within this volume for me were the numerous original-edition illustrations generously sprinkled throughout.  These, as much as Tatar's well-written and researched narrative, helps the reader understand what portions of the fairy tales were emphasized over the years.	2003-08-04

To begin with, and perhaps most importantly, Macintyre is a terrific writer, researcher, and storyteller.  This is not a dry history about names and dates, but rather about relationships and the misfortune of living in the wrong area at the wrong time.  Macintyre beautifully illustrates the shifting alliances in a small town in France, Villeret, which found itself tucked just behind enemy lines.  Into this village come lost English soldiers in the opening months of World War 1, cut off from their divisions and a means of escape.  Their impact upon Villeret during their 18-month stay is profound as one of the soldiers, Robert Digby, falls in love with a young French woman.  Macintyre helps us understand the prejudices, jealousies, and emotions which shift and change among the townspeople throughout the war.  During that time, the Englishmen become a little less loved and revered and their presence becomes resented.  The Germans, conversely, become less reviled.  Macintyre also deftly weaves the mystery of who betrayed the Englishmen into his tale, giving a convincing argument for his &quot;best guess&quot; at the end.  In Macintyre's hands, this history truly comes back to life.	2003-07-23

The humor holds up surprisingly well. It was a rare page in which I didn't laugh out loud.  I have no doubt that P.G Wodehouse was greatly influenced by Jerome's style.  There is action within the two volumes, but the thrust of the action provides little more than an opportunity to move on to the next humorous incident or related story.  J. and his two friends, George and Harris, are three bumbling stooges who do everything possible to avoid having to earn an honest living, so they travel.  In the first book, Three Men in a Boat, they are single and care-free, but by the time the second book, Three Men on a Bummel, was published, two of the three characters, J. and Harris, are family men.  Although the second book is funny, I would agree with earlier reviewers that it's not quite the laugh-out-loud humor of the previous volume, but that's understandable, since our heroes are older and slightly more respectable.  Still in all, following their adventures is great fun and makes for a wonderful summer read.  I can't help but wonder if today's favorite travel humorist (humor travelist?), Bill Bryson, wasn't also influenced by the wonderful musings of Jerome.	2003-07-08

We all enjoyed it on different levels.  As an adult, I enjoyed the wealth of well-defined characters, from the older, slightly grumpy detective, Victor, to the pre-teen title character.  There was well-paced action throughout, with an unexpected introduction of magic and mysticism at the end.  And therein lies my criticism of this book.  In no way was the reader set up to expect the magical elements in the book's final 50 pages.  What had started out as a suspenseful, character-driven book had, by book's end, turned into a different monster altogether.  It felt as if Funke changed directions on us.  By the same token, the author also changes the book's focus upon just who is the main character.  The title notwithstanding, Scipio, the self-named Thief Lord, was a supporting character throughout most of the book, with the bulk of the action revolving around Prop and Bo, as they attempt to hide from their aunt in the alleys of Venice.  By the end, however, The Thief Lord is the one who goes through the most radical changes, thereby truly becoming the book's main protaganist.  This fuzziness on Funke's part is problematic because we haven't truly focused on Scipio's relationship with his father, which is what is ultimately driving Scipio's actions and decisions.  It almost feels as if Funke started the book, got about half-way through its writing, put it away for a year, and finished it in a totally different manner from where she had begun.<BR>Oh, well... these problems notwithstanding, it made for a great read.  Funke has a great book inside of her.  The Thief Lord may ultimately prove to be its predecessor.	2003-07-08

Tuchman's book is a classic for several reasons.  If one does not know much about WW 1, her book is a terrific place to begin.  For me, it answered two of the key mysteries of the war: why did the assassination of the Austrian heir apparent so quickly develop into a world-wide conflagration; and why were the Allies so angry at Germany that they imposed reparations that crippled it for years, ultimately leading to WW 2?  Tuchman handles both issues wonderfully, in fact, devoting 2 chapters to each of those issues.  In so doing, she brings the key characters of the drama to full life, most interesting of them being stubborn Sir John French, leader of the British Expeditionary Forces; French General Joffre with his numerous insecurities; brave King Albert of Belgium; and indepedent French General Lanrezac.  Once again, Tuchman reminds us all too well that history is made up of personalities.  There are times in which mediocre people rise to unusual challenges and become heroes.  There are far too many other times in which people of stature and position sink miserably into mediocrity.  World War One was one such occasion.	2003-06-18

Kagan presents a wonderfully logical argument about the relationship between Europe and America.  And while he doesn't necessarily present any information that is new or surprising, he does help connect the dots in a manner that makes most readers go, \\"Aha!\\"  Kagan's writing style is very user-friendly, unusual in a field known for its clunky style and obscure historical references (Thomas Friedman notwithstanding).  He uses wonderful anecdotes and analogies to help paint his picture of the differences in the ways that America and Europe view world-wide threats (A bear roaming in the woods is viewed differently by a man with a rifle as opposed to a man with a knife).  And given these acknowledged differences, is it any wonder that America and Europe increasingly find conflict over the way we resolve these problems?  America wants to quickly solve the problems with arms (we have lots of over-powering weapons and a strong distaste for any American deaths); Europe would much rather discuss the problems over time and come to a non-conflict resolution (they don't have the weapons and have come to appreciate the power of discussion).  As a dyed-in-the-wool liberal, one who attended the numerous spring anti-war demonstrations throughout my hometown, I now look at the world in a different way after reading this fine book -- and what could be a better compliment to any author?  And while I continue to feel America's heavy-handed approach is ultimately wrong, this book has given me a more balanced perception of the way things work.	2003-04-24

This 92-year-old matriarch, living in Zurich, made out extremely well during World War II, not only stealing (or \\"saving\\", as she rationalizes) antiques and art pieces from Jewish victims of the Holocaust, but also informing the Nazis on the whereabouts of her Jewish friends.  Toward the end of the war, when Berlin was about to fall, Muller-Rossi was able to take these possessions out of Berlin in several large trucks, cross the border into Switzerland, and set up shop.  The book's action is built around two hard-to-believe coincidences.  First, that one of her victims happens to walk past Muller-Rossi's store window and recognize a table that had been taken from her 60 years earlier.  Second, that right at that moment when the victim, Sarah Freeman, spots the table, Muller-Rossi's granddaughter walks by, sees Freeman crying, and asks what's wrong.  Seemingly implausible, but I bought it.  What I struggled with was why Muller-Rossi's granddaughter, Helen, and son -- Helen's father, Nicholas -- were so willing to side with Freeman at the expense of Muller-Rossi.  We simply had to take this leap that son and granddaughter were willing to accept a stranger's story without giving Lucia a chance to explain her side of events.  As a reader of a novel, we did get a sense of Lucia's side, but unfortunately, there wasn't much to like.  She was, plain and simple, an opportunist without much of a decent bone in her body, mother of a young son during wartime or not.  Although Pye's writing and evocation of time and place is splendid, the book would ultimately have been more powerful if Muller-Rossi had been created as a more sympathetic character.  One of Pye's key points is that life can be quite grey.  Unfortunately, his main character comes off as black-and-white.	2003-04-13

But McEwan is far more than just a good &quot;writer,&quot; he is a good storyteller, as well, which seems to be an increasingly diminishing capability with so many of today's authors.  From the initial moments of deceit at the beginning of the novel, to the incredible description of the horrors of war which comprise the middle of the book, to the resolution in the final pages, this is a beautiful page-turner.  To borrow an over-used saying, but one which is true in this particular case, McEwan is truly a writer at the top of his craft.	2003-02-04

There's no doubt that Franzen can write.  But not only is there not a cohesive story being told here, I felt like I needed a shower after spending 500+ pages with these characters.  With whom was I, as the reader, supposed to sympathize?  Every single character was as self-obsessed as any I've come across in a long time.  Gary, the older son, was involved in a lousy marriage.  His wife and children were aligned against him, but can we really blame them?  (By the way, what ever happened to the buildup concerning the hidden camera in the kitchen?  Only one of numerous minor story lines that had absolutely no payoff).  Maybe Chip, the younger son, who was off on bizarre adventures in Eastern Europe?  Maybe the emotionally abusive lesbian daughter, Denise?  Hardly.  Oddly, the one character we were positioned NOT to like was the mother of this clan.  But nowhere in the book did I firmly understand why she was supposed to be so unlikeable.  Fine, she isn't perfect, but she certainly wasn't the wicked witch Franzen was attempting to portray her as.  This is writing as an extended therapy session, with Franzen simply trying to work out years of self-loathing and anger against his own family.  Reading this book just reinforced something I've known for years... go with books that friends and acquaintances recommend, not the critics.	2003-01-12

I say \\"suprisingly honest\\" because one could certainly understand if Dawidoff were to give in to hero worship -- given the important role his grandfather played in his upbringing.  But Dawidoff saves the hero worship and the highly personal anecdotes for the opening and concluding chapters. The 300 or so pages in between give a very balanced depiction of a complicated man, and that's the stuff of great biography.  The first half of the book is a real page-turner, chronicling Gerschenkron's difficult times as a young man in revolutionary Russia and fascist Austria.   How could Dawidoff possibly keep up this pace once his grandfather settles down as an educator at Harvard?  Well, he doesn't, through no fault of his own.  Dawidoff's depiction of Gershenkron's latter life is beautifully written, but the exciting pace of the earlier pages simply can't be sustained.  Dawidoff clearly spent a great amount of time interviewing Gerschenkron's colleagues and students, most of whom (although not all) were effusive in their praise.  But the book tended to feel slightly repetitious toward the end with the ongoing remembrances and non-related anecdotes.  For one so close to the story, Dawidoff managed to expertly review and analyze Gerschenkron's complicated doting relationship with his wife, Erica.  Also, a wonderfully telling anecdote at the end of the book reveals not only Gerschenkron's character, but Dawidoff's patient understanding, as well.  Although Gerschenkron was an expert chess player, somehow he managed to lose his queen to the 14-year-old Dawidoff.  Gerschenkron swept his arm across the board, spilling all the pieces onto the floor.  \\"Num, num,\\" he said.  \\"Let's go eat lunch.\\"	2002-08-04

But he tells it in such a way that you can't help but laugh along with him, while feeling incredibly sorry for the situation that has been forced upon him.  Eggers' writing style is honest, introspective, spontaneous, and thoughtful, seemingly all within the same sentences.  I felt a sense of awe in reading this book that I did when I first read The Catcher in the Rye, On the Road, or Portnoy's Complaint, all books which had a very strong male character capturing a certain moment of time in America.

During his own childhood (the early years of World War II), Frayn's best friend makes the statement to him, &quot;My mother is a German spy.&quot;  In writing this novel, Frayn takes this true event and plays the &quot;what if&quot; game.  The two friends know that this is just a game, just a means of passing a summer afternoon, but what if they spy on her and start to see actions that might indicate that she truly is a spy?  It's a wonderful look at how perplexing the adult world can be to a child, and how wrong our impressions -- either as a child or as an adult -- can be when we don't explore the full picture.  Frayn throws a clever curveball at the very end of the book, one which could have been predicted by the careful reader.  It's unfortunate that this book has come out at the same time that Ian McEwan's book, Atonement, was issued, since they are somewhat similar in theme (the wide ramifications of a child's actions during World War II), and it may ultimately get lost in the literary shuffle.  That's a shame, for reading it on its own is a terrific way to spend a weekend.	2002-05-21

So they combined English Lit with the sci-fi genre and they came up with the character Thursday Next, convinced they would have a sure-fire hit on their hands.  Yes, there are clever literary allusions sprinkled throughout the book, although none that are too terribly challenging for anyone who has had an introductory high school class in English.   Literature.  Also, there are frustrating inconsistencies within the book.  For instance, whenever Thursday's father appears in a scene from recent time travels, everybody freezes except for Thursday.  Why?  Her immunity to the &quot;time freeze&quot; is never explained.  Is it a genetic thing?  Also, with the Chronoguards ability to travel through time, why isn't the &quot;Shakespeare-authorship&quot; issue (a theme which, tiringly, runs throughout the book) already settled?

Kapuscinski is a brilliant writer and, more importantly, a brilliant story teller.  Visions of certain related stories play through my head as if a part of my own distant memories, such as his killing of a snake, his night in a cockroach-infested hotel room in Monrovia, his descriptions of heat and sunlight. My only complaint about this book is that it dwells too much on the negatives of Africa.  Surely somewhere there are beautiful cities, or at least sections of cities.  Although the history, personalities, and misdeeds came through strongly, the beauty of this continent did not.	2001-05-21

By the end, one has lowered his walls and become engaged in life, the other hardens himself and becomes more respected by those around him.  As with all of Hornby's writing, there is a great deal to laugh about in this book.  But it is a more self-revelatory laugh, one in which you may not be laughing so much at the book's characters, as you are in recognizing one's own failings.	2001-02-23

There are few young writers who are able to bring their characters to life quite like Chabon can.  Scattered throughout the book are touching scenes, hilarious scenes (Tripp throwing a dead, stiff boa constrictor at his attacker), scenes that make you want to cry because you've been there, as well as wonderful dialogue.  Chabon is immensely talented.  Wonderboys is a quick read, but do yourself a favor and take your time with this one.	2000-11-14

Assuming you buy into the presumption that a biography on an NFL football coach (even if that coach is Lombardi himself) is worthy of 500 pages, than you will, no doubt, enjoy this particular tome.  Maraniss is a terrific writer and researcher and it comes through clearly.  However, during certain passages, I felt he was either striving to make it to the magical 500-page hurdle, or simply would have benefited from better editing.  He excels at humanizing this mythical character and, in fact, tackles (sorry) head on the myth surrounding Lombardi that has been created during the 30 years since his death.  Lombardi was no saint, and Maraniss is not afraid to point that out, unlike certain biographers (such as A. Scott Berg's treatment of Lindbergh) who end up &quot;liking&quot; their subjects so much that they end up apologizing for certain actions.  Maraniss is not afraid to point out Lombardi's flaws, and he had several of them, primarily in the treatment of his wife and children.  Maraniss paints scenes beautifully, and in so doing brings his subject to life.  There is a wonderful description of a dinner-table scene in which Lombardi's wife, Marie, and two children, Vincent and Susan, sit silently and expectantly waiting for Vince to say something.  He finally clears his throat... Marie and children sit up with great expectation, waiting for the jewels of wisdom to pour forth from the coach... a greeting... a story from his busy day... anything that recognizes their presence.  All that is said, however, is, &quot;Pass the salt, Marie.&quot;  Could there be a better way to convey the isolation each of the family members experienced?  Lombardi was terrifically successful on the football field, and that is how his true worth will always be measured.  Unfortunately, his family members may have been using a different measuring stick.	2000-10-26

Stephenson's knowledge of events of World War II, the development of military codes, the birth of the computer, etc., is truly mind-boggling.  Despite its heft, at 900 pages +, I never once felt my attention slipping, which is quite a tribute to Stephenson's writing skills.  Great characterization, several gripping stories (present day and past history), as well as fascinating facts make for time well spent.  If this truly is a first volume, I anxiously await volumes 2 - ?	2000-09-30
US	52704912	RKFRDVIVV8OGW	0385491832	352044771	Motherless Brooklyn	Books	3	5	6	N	Y	Mixed feelings...	The first 100 pages of this book were terrific.  Great voice... great character development, of both the main character and the 3 other Minna men.  But then, the first 100 pages were all flashback.  Once we returned  to the main thread of the story, I felt the narrative thrust slowed down,  and even came to a halt.  A strange series of events began unfolding, none  of which really helped the reader understand the crime which had been  committed.  The crime was unraveled in the final 30 pages in which Lionel  finds out what happened through Julia's explanation, not really through his  own sleuthing.  This section, by the way, felt like a return to the  beautiful prose from the beginning of the book.  Gripping narrative in and  of itself, although unsatisfying since the solution is being handed to us.   It's not a solution we could have arrived at by ourselves through clues  dropped within the body of the work.  So... is this the neo-detective  story, one in which plotline is secondary to character development?  Fine,  I'll buy it, but why bother making it a detective story?  For beautiful  writing and memorable characters, I would have graded it 5 stars.  But for  a detective story, and all the baggage and expectations that encompass that  genre, I would have given it 2 stars.  Average it out at 3 stars.	2000-05-25

He's proven that on numerous occasions.  But the Steinbeck autobiography proves he is also an excellent researcher and distiller of information.  Steinbeck has been one  of my favorite writers for years, and, as stated within his preface, he is  one of Parini's favorites as well.  Parini's admiration for Steinbeck comes  across, as he details the many periods of Steinbeck's life, such as the  Depression years, the war correspondence days, and the latter novels, such  as The Winter of Our Discontent and Travels with Charley.  Of particular  interest within this biography is Parini's exploration of Steinbeck's  psychological background and why he includes so many strong female  characters within his novels.	2000-03-29

By combining historical facts of artist Pieter Bruegel's life, as well as 16th century Netherlandish history, into a novel of 20th century  deceit, Frayn has created a classic for all times.  An enjoyable -- and  heady -- read for anyone lucky enough to pick this one up.	2000-02-26

I was particularly struck by the humanity demonstrated on the part of Dr. Murray toward Minor.  Would this same treatment take place today if a  person in charge of a project such as the OED project were to find out that  one of his &quot;vendors&quot; resided in a mental institution?  I kept  expecting to learn that Murray, upon discovering where Minor resided, would  doubt the validity of Minor's research and go through a &quot;crisis&quot;  of sorts.  Rather, he responded with great concern and empathy.   I also  appreciated that Winchester did not feel  600 pages were required to tell  this tale.  Sometimes, great things truly do come in small packages.  My  one small complaint:  Winchester's writing style, in which 2 - 3 sentences  were oftentimes contained within other sentences, offset by hypens ,  parentheses and brackets.  I  found myself returning to the beginning of a  sentence just to remind me what the subject was.  It's an effective style  when used on a limited basis.	1999-11-18

I found Anderson's description of Cuny's life, the  current situation in Russia, and the background of the war in Chechnya to  be fascinating and extremely well handled.  Like &quot;Into Thin Air,&quot;  this book was an incredible page-turner.  In a land full of  &quot;misdirection plays,&quot; deception, and flat-out lies, Anderson  succeeds at sifting through the clues and evidence and coming up with --  and examining -- the various scenarios of what may have happened with Cuny.   Fantastic investigation and writing.	1999-09-13

The Christmas pasta with sugar, almonds and orange zest, topped by a capon has become an annual tradition in our family.

In  fact, this book actually helped direct us when planning our gastronomical  tour of northern Italy.	1999-09-07

You know what happens to the principle characters within the initial pages, while the rest of the book is dedicated to telling us why those people we've just met are  important.  Sydney Parade, with the best of all intentions, inadvertently  causes a horrible chain of events, making him the title character, the  &quot;dangerous friend.&quot;  Comparisons must be made to Greene's  &quot;The Quiet American,&quot; another book which focuses upon the  innocence of a single character to illustrate the overall naivete of a  nation's efforts.  We Americans love to believe that simple optimism,  confidence and determination will win the day.  As Parade -- and America --  learned, there are several more factors involved.	1999-08-16

It was a nicely-wrapped bit of soft-porn fluff.  It reminded me of another prettily-packaged piece of cotton candy from 5 years ago, The Bridges of  Madison County.  I felt the story line was weak and unrealistic (obsessed  by a friend from 7th grade? Hey, buddy boy, get a life!), the writing style  -- or translation -- incredibly juvenile, all of which led to a non-ending.   Having read these reviews before buying the book, I truly anticipated a  great reading experience.  But, at least in this case, a good thing did not  come in a small package.	1999-06-10

In McEwan's world  of post-war Germany, no one is truly innocent, or at least no one beyond  page 20, and nothing is truly as it seems.  All is a shade of grey, nothing  is black and white.  This book is gripping, as Leonard's life becomes more  ensnared in lies and cover-ups. A terrific read.	1999-05-03

This book thankfully helped pass the time on a very frustrating day of air travel for me.  Yes, although at times somewhat sophomoric, I thoroughly  enjoyed Rushin's irreverant observations about sports -- and life -- in  America.  Two sections above the rest stood out as especially memorable for  me (a Minnesota Vikings fan):  his memories of the Vikings teams of the  70's, punctuated with a wonderful story of waiting and anticipating Alan  Page's granting an autograph; and the story regarding the void left in  Cleveland by the departure of the Browns.

After having won for last year's &quot;American Pastoral,&quot; Roth will not win  for this year's &quot;I Married a Communist.&quot;  That's too bad, because  he deserves it.  In fact, in many ways, &quot;I Married a Communist&quot;  is better.  It's a story of a fascinating time in America's history, when  those in all walks of life (but, in this case, the entertainment industry)  were blacklisted for their leftward-leaning tendencies.  Ira Ringold is a  fascinating, complicated character. His brother, Murray, is instantly  likeable.  And even Nathan Zuckermann learns a little bit more about  himself and the world around him from his 6-day interaction with his  ex-teacher, Murray. What I liked most about this book was the true closure  of the ending (something I felt lacking in American Pastoral).  It was  beautifully wrapped up by Nathan's analogy of the souls of dead folks  becoming stars in the heavens. Is the Pulitzer-prize winning team  courageous enough to award the prize to the same author twice in a row?   We'll find out.	1998-11-30

I  was interested enough by the article to go out and read &quot;A Sport and a  Pastime.&quot;  Having read so many good books over the last 20 years, it  is rare for me to trip across an author's work in which I think, on every  page, migod, this guy is good.

Hickam portrays certain events wonderfully, growing up in the 1950s,  teenage friendship, the heartbreak of a first &quot;crush,&quot; and, most  importantly, a teen's ability to excel by using his brain rather than his  brawn.  I found Hickam's  difficulty in dealing with his brother and father  to be touching.  However, throughout the book, I had this vague sense that  Hickam was trying desperately to write a screenplay, more than a truthful  account of important and defining events in his teen years.  Throughout the  book, I tried to determine which was truth and which was fabrication.  Had  this been presented as fiction, rather than &quot;memoir,&quot; I could  have enjoyed the book more as just a good yarn, a sort of Hardy Boys for  adults.  Bookstores are pushing this as the best memoir since  &quot;Angela's Ashes,&quot; which does disservice to that classic.	1998-10-27
