These books both have different covers &amp; different names but every single page is identical! I already owned ' decorating cakes &amp; cookies' by this author &amp; liked it, so when i saw this one i ordered it.I was very disappointed to open it find out that i already had this book with a different cover &amp; name!

This is a very nice book,keep in mind it is from England.Over there they like to use fondant/sugarpaste for their cake decorating,where we Americans prefer buttercream.It is a good teaching guide.	2000-11-03

I agree with everything the other people have said about thisbook.I sat down to look through it with a pen &amp; paper,so that icould keep notes about which items i wanted to make.Needless to say i just stopped writing.I want to make just about everything in this book.I will not have a need for any other dessert books ever! It has everything, cookies, pies, tarts, cakes, puddings, frozen desserts, pastries, etc. If you want sugar free then theres alot of choices to make with Equal.I wish i had been aware of this book before i had purchased several of the other ones i now have.	2000-01-02

This book has so many things we want to do that we cant decide what to do first.Alot of the ingredients are things we alreay have in the house.The only diappointment is that it has so many finger paint and clay recipes.They couldve taken some of those out and list other things instead.	2000-01-02

I just finished reading through this book and i cant wait to get started.I really love the check list in the back so we can't forget anything we need to get started.The only thing that i do not like is every picture has been drawn.We would love to have some real color pictures to look at.	1999-11-20
