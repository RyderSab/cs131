The plot is very engrossing, is Elisabeth really alive or is someone playing games with Dr. Beck? The book moves at a lightning pace with plenty of twists and no dull spots. The ending is also great with a very suprising revelation. This is a must read for mystery and thriller fans. I look forward to Harlans next book, whatever it is about, but as good as this was, I do hope that there will be more Myron in the future.	2001-07-12
US	51786058	R3H9PKOKPUGWSY	0399147365	873881745	Cold Paradise (Stone Barrington)	Books	4	0	3	N	N	Fun read	Like all Stone Barrington novels this was an enjoyable read for  a day at the beach. Also like all Stone Barrington novels it is very superficial and not very deep. The characters, including Stone, are all one dimensonal and the plot is fairly flimsy with a predictable ending. Yet despite these flaws it is still an enjoyable book. I guess the secret to his success is that the reader gets to live vicariously through Stone who basically has it all. Basically it is a &quot;trashy&quot; mystery novel, but a fun and easy read.	2001-05-22

I didn't much like The Empty Chair, and I especially didn't like Speaking in Tongues. He has snapped out of the doldrums in a big way however with The Blue Nowhere. I won't go into detail about the plot here as it has already been done. But I will say that (in hacker lingo) that this book was totally Moby. The book starts out fast with a murder in the first few pages by the super hacker/super villian Phate. From there the suspense builds up constantly in the cat and mouse chase to bring him down. All the main characters are well drawn and interesting, and there are plenty of twists along the way in the Deaver tradition. Even though it is filled with lots of technical detail there is no &quot;filler&quot; as the book remains exciting right the way through. Until the last 20 pages that is. If I have one complaint about the book that is what it is. Phate goes down with a whimper, and the identity of Shawn is absurd. I skimmed the last 20 pages because they seemed very anti climatic to me. The rest of the book was so good though, I was willing to forgive the ending. If you like Deaver or nail biting suspense, you should definitely give The Blue Nowhere a shot.	2001-05-22

Not the best, but an entertaining read nonetheless. It is a fast and easy read, I finished it in about 3 hours. It is nice to see many of the characters from earlier novels have a reunion of sorts, although I typically prefer the Spenser novels when they are set in Boston, and not &quot;on the road&quot;. The dialogue is typically good, with lots of deadpan humor involved. A very light read, but good, especially if you are a Spenser fan.	2001-04-19

I was hoping he would bounce back with his newest book and he did. Murder One has everything you could ask for in a legal thriller, mystery, suspense, exciting courtroom scenes, great characters (although Paula is kind of annoying), a hero in peril, and a suprising twist at the end. The only complaint with the book is that there wasn't as much of the humor that is seen in his other books. Overall, Murder One is a fast paced, exciting book that I would recommend to any one who is a fan of this genre.	2001-04-19

It was definitely a fast paced read, as I finished it in one siting. However, although I normally like his style of very short chapters, for some reason I didnt feel that it worked well here. It really seemed to break up the flow of the novel. If you have read Patterson before you know he always goes for a suprise ending, which doesnt work here, because if you think about it you can figure out what will happen long before the end. Basically, it is a relatively entertaining novel, but it doesnt break any new ground. I would call it &quot;Patterson-lite&quot;. I think Pattersons biggest problem is that he is putting books out too fast these days. This is what, his third book in the last six months? Maybe now that he is so popular he feels that he doesnt have too try as hard, and he is going for quantity over quality. Check it out from the library instead of buying it.	2001-04-16

Her last book was a dissapointment however, and I am sorry to say that this is an even bigger one. Maybe I am crazy, seeing as how it has been geting glowing reviews here, but I just didn't like it. I thought it was very slow paced, and not very suspenseful at all. I found myself constantly skimming ahead for the &quot;good&quot; parts. The characters were flat and pigeon Tony was annoying with his constant &quot;I no murder him, I kill him!&quot; There were snippets of humor, but nothing compared to some of her previous books. I hate writing such a negative review of an author I like, but that is how I feel. I will still read her next book, and hopefully it will go better.	2001-04-16

I am suprised at the number of poor reviews it has received here. It has lots of &quot;inside&quot; information about the White House and its inner workings that are very interesting. The plot is fast paced with plenty of twists. The characters are interesting and complex, and Meltzer really keeps you guessing as to who the bad guy will turn out to be.

The main character is good because he is flawed and is not the &quot;perfect&quot; character you often see. The secondary characters are all pretty one-dimensional however. The plot is lightning paced, with a steadily rising body count, and plenty of twists, making for an interesting, quick read. The only complaint about the plot is that it comes off as somewhat &quot;trashy&quot;, soap operaish at times. And the ending is definitely a bit overblown. Still, it is an enjoyable novel that is easy to read and can be quickly polished off in one sitting. Frey is still the master of the financial thriller genre.	2001-03-01

I didn't mind the fact that it was a book with new characters, and after reading the start of the book, I thought that it ws going to be great. Unfortunately, after the first few chapters it started going downhill. At a glance the book seems to have a lot going for it, it is well written with Lehanes typical stylistic prose, there are some complex themes explored and it has a well laid out plot. Where it fails is in the characters, which is ironic because that was one of the biggest strengths of his previous novels.  They all have a lot of depth, unfortunately it is all negative. There isn't a sympathetic character in the book, and it seems that only bad things happen to anybody. Ultimately the book fails because of a lack of suspense; you really don't care what happens to anybody. It is basically quite a depressing novel, quite a downer. I still think Lehane is a fantastic writer, hopefully his next novel will be more enjoyable.	2001-02-24
US	51786058	R2W9FS9JXUGA1P	0446608483	835067122	The Pledge	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Great book	The Pledge was one of my favorite reads of the year, and I have read a lot of books. It is the type of book that just grips you and has you looking forward to reading every chance you  get. After you read a chapter you are always left saying well maybe just one more, and then another. It is quite long, but reads very fast. The characters are well developed and likeable, and there are numerous interesting subplots weaved into the main story. There is also some humorous moments, especially involving the dean. The main plot is very compelling, and the plot twists are numerous. I hope Rob Kean has another book this good up his sleeve. I highly recommend this one.	2001-01-08

Alex joins up with FBI agent Betsey Cavalierre in the hunt for the Mastermind as the crime spree escalates. The closer they get to catching him, the more bold he becomes, proving himself to be quite a twisted character. To add to Crosses problems, his daughter falls victim to a mysterious illness, and his girlfriend is leaving him. As always Cross is a likeable central character, and the plot is fast paced, helped along by quick moving  chapters. However there are some dull moments, and at times it is somewhat unbelievable. There is also some cheap manipulation in trying to mislead the reader as to the identity of the mastermind. The actual identity of the Mastermind will come as a shock to most readers, however I am not sure if I really bought it. Overall it is a very easy, and mostly interesting read, but Patterson is capable of something much better.	2000-12-31

This time around Alex and Milo are on the trail of whoever killed Eldon Mate aka &quot;Dr. Death&quot;, the assisted suicide doctor. The list of suspects is not a small one. Is it the husband of one of the doctors &quot;victims&quot;? or possibly his son? Or is it another doctor who likes to kill his ill patients and who is being hunted by the FBI? One of Mates followers? Great dialogue and interesting psychological insights by Alex help propel a suspenseful psycological thriller. Highly recommended.	2000-12-31

If you are Burke Devore in The Ax, you simply kill off the competition. Devore's 'simple' plan is to locate a  job that he would be perfectly qualified for, determine possible  competition through a scam advertising false employment, then murder the  competitors before finally killing off the incumbent employee and taking  his job. Devore comes to the morally skewed conclusion that these people  are the problem coming between him and his old life, and feels that he is  justified killing them in &quot;self-defense&quot; <br />Adding to Devores  problems is his wifes confession of infidelity, and his sons arrest for  burglary. Westlake does such a good job depicting the misery and the  intangible factors corresponding to losing ones job that you feel for  Devore, while not condoning his actions. Will he get away with his plan or  will he bail out or be caught? My only quibble is the prose style which is  very top heavy on narrative and light on dialogue, which makes it somewhat  slow at a few points. Overall, a gripping, well written, satirical look at  life in today's economic climate that is made that much more chilling  because of its plausibility.	2000-06-23

I am happy that I did. His main character Leo Waterman is in the same vein as Robert Crais' Elvis Cole, only perhaps not quite as funny. In Last  Ditch, Leo, in the course of doing some renovations to his property, comes  across a buried body. The body turns out to be that of his late politician  fathers biggest enemy, and has been missing for some 30 years. Obviously  Leo's father is the number one suspect, so Leo sets out to find the truth.  Leo is a great character in the genre, tough, but not unbelievably so, very  human, and of course wisecracking. There are lots of twists and turns and  misdirections in this well plotted novel. The writing is also above the  quality often found in the genre, Ford really puts the reader into the  scene. If you like a good mystery, Last Ditch is a good place to look.	2000-06-21

Darkest Fear is no exception. Myron, Win, and the rest of the gang are all back, in a somewhat darker and more serious novel than previous  entries in the series. Of course, the trademark Myron humor is still  present though, striking a good balance between laughing one second, and  being scared the next. Darkest Fear has the fast pace, numerous plot  twists, and great characterization that Cobens fans have come to expect.  Original, sophisticated,and hitting on many emotional levels, Darkest Fear  shouldn't be missed by old and new fans alike.	2000-06-17
US	51786058	R3NCM0S6QRILY7	0316690619	95144783	Cradle and All	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Bizzare! (2 1/2 stars)	When you think of James Patterson, this is not the type of book that would come to mind. Basically it is an end of the world, apocalyptic type thriller. Two virgins are pregnant, one with the son of Christ and one with  the son of Satan. Floods, famine, disease, etc. is spreading across the  world and can only be stopped if the son of Satan is destroyed. Sound  weird? Well it is. More of a Stephen King or Dean Koontz type of book, and  they would likely do it better. In all honesty if it hadn't been written by  Patterson, I may have not even read it. <br />It is relatively entertaining if  you can stretch your imagination, and it is definitely fast paced: I  finished it in one evening. However it really isn't that great of a book.  First, there are way too many characters. The only character you can really  feel anything for is Anne, because her story is told in the first person.  As for the rest of the characters you feel so detached from them you really  don't care what their fate will be. They aren't very well drawn out either  past a surface level. The writing also isn't up to the  quality that you  expect from Patterson. Also, the ending is very cheesy. As well, the entire  time I was reading I couldn't help but think of the Schwarzenegger movie  'End of Days' I was half expecting Arnie to appear in the book at any time  saying &quot;I vil stop ze Devil&quot; There were also some glaring editing  errors. One major one that comes to mind was the fact that early in the  book Anne was &quot;nearing thirty&quot;, and at the end she was 34 years  old. Very rapid aging indeed. Perhaps it was due to the apocalyptic  circumstances? Hmmm... I could go on with more errors  but I digress. You  just shouldn't see sloppy editing like that in a novel by a top author. <br />  Overall, I would say that as a library book it was OK, but if I had paid  money for it I would be disappointed. Patterson should stick with what he  does best, and should also take a little more care inhis writing.	2000-06-10

Some different adjectives come to mind for this one though:  boring, convoluted,  and dissapointing, just to name a few. It started off  well enough, but went downhill before it was 50 pages in. The character of  Lucas Davenport was very flat this time, his only focus outside of the case  being the multiple women he was juggling and there were way too many  supporting characters, causing you to wonder who was who sometimes. The  plot itself was dull and lacking in any suspense or tension. You really  didn't care waht happened next, which was good, because nothing of interest  ever did happen. And the ending appeared out of left field, but by that  point you are just glad its over. You get the feeling that Sandford was  sitting around one day when he suddenly realized he had a book due soon,  and he just hammered it out quickly on autopilot. A character quips near  the end of the book, &quot;This is boring my _ brains out&quot;, a quote  which could be attributed to the book as well. I hope Sandford and  Davenport fare better next time out, I have faith that they will.	2000-06-05

It is as good of a novel as many more established authors usually write. The main character, Carl Houseman, makes for an excellent narrator with his straight-forward,  no-nonsense style and often deadpan wit. The rest of the characters are  solid, and basically what you expect from this type of novel. The plot  itself revolves around some very gruesome, Stephen King type ritual  murders. Harstad doles out the information and twists  in such a way as to  maintain a fast pace, and keep the suspense level high throughout. I look  forward to reading more of his work soon.	2000-06-04

It is a follow up to The Blue Hour, but not as enjoyable. Merci Rayborn is not the most likeable  character, lacking in warmth or affection towards others. However she does  undergo change over the course of the novel, especially compared to the  previous book. But whether likeable or not, she is well drawn, as is most  of the supporting cast. <br />As far as the plot is concerned, it basically  concerns the murder of two prostitutes, one current and one 30 years in the  past. The investigation of the current murder is interesting, with Merci  eventually being forced to arrest her lover and fellow oficer Mike McNally.  Although whether he is guilty or not remains in doubt. The problem lies  with the old murder. You know that in the end the two murders will somehow  be connected, but the connection is very hard to see until the conclusion.  This causes you to lose interest in anything to do with that case, and  breaks things up, undercutting any build up of tension or suspense  involving the main case. Also the ending becomes somewat anti-climatic due  to the tying together of the cases. The writing is good as usual, and the  potential was there for a better book, but in the end it is only pretty  good, and not great.	2000-06-02

One the one hand I was looking forward to something different from Crais because he is a fantastic author, but on the other  hand I need my Elvis fix! But I can now say that after reading Demolition  Angel I have forgotten about Elvis (temporarily, of course).<br />Demolition  Angel is much darker and edgier than the Elvis Cole novels. The main  character, Carol Starkey, is on a path to self destruction. Bitter,  alienated, and self-abusive since the bomb blast death of her partner, she  must regain control of her life or be destroyed herself. While struggling  with her personal demons, she must catch the killer who is targeting bomb  squad technicians in a series of explosions. Is Mr. Red the mad bomber or  is it someone else?<br />Non-stop action, intense suspense, and plenty of  twists along the way lead to an explosive climax. An intelligent,  multi-dimensional thriller, Demolition Angel will keep your heart racing  and keep you on the edge as you race through the pages. Crais at his best  matches up with anyone else. Period.	2000-05-19

Flimsy see-through plot, basic stereotypical characters, fairly obvious conclusion, and basically ho-hum all the way. Nothing terribly wrong with  it, but nothing that stands out at all either. One big hole though is the  absence of Hawk, which leaves a gaping void. As well, the ending comes up  short as if Parker decided to call it quits before really wrapping  everything up. Overall a very light, quick read that you probably want to  read if you are a fan of the series. There are lots of better books out  there, but there are also many much worse.	2000-05-17

Deaver grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the last page. However, as with most of his novels, you must be willing to suspend  reality at times. There is nothing outright unbelievable, but there are  lots of very improbable occurences. This is easy to overlook though due to  the heart stopping suspense and racing plot. Deaver also adds to the  quality of the novel with intriging characters that are very well  developed. And of course there are plenty of twists as readers of Deaver  have come to expect. Unfortunately anyone familiar with Deaver will  probably see the what, if not the who, of the main twist coming well ahead  of time. Overall, a fantastic thriller that you will find hard to put down.	2000-05-16

However, if you enjoy a ballistic plot,  highly original characters and lots of fun and laughs along the way, then  you should definitely read it. Chet is just an &quot;ordinary&quot; guy who  gets accidentaly mixed up in a life and death struggle against the Cineese  mafia, putting himself and his friends at risk. What follows is some fast  and furious action that is fun but borders an the absurd at times.  Eventually the battle moves to cyberspace, and another foe - MP Phred joins  the mix. Somewhere along the line the plot gets muddled with too many bad  guys and too much going on, but plows forward on sheer adrenalin. The  characters are very original and there are lots of funny exchanges between  them throughout. The writing style is very fresh and enthusiastic adding to  the fun. So yes, it does have its flaws, many courtesy of its  over-enthusiasum but it is also that same enthusiasum that makes for an  exciting, fun, original experience.	2000-05-07

I would probably have given it 3 1/2 stars if  I could have. It is a good book, but you get the been there, done that  feeling while reading it. It is interesting enough, with likeable  characters, good pace and the neurosurgery aspect is well done, but the  &quot;suprises&quot; are way too predictable, draining much of the  suspense. I enjoyed the conflict between Jessie and the egomaniacal Dr.  Gilbride. It added an interesting dimension to the book. Also there wasn't  any mention at the end about what happened to the rest of Jessies patients,  unless I somehow missed it, which was a dubious ommision. Overall, a solid  if not spectacular book.	2000-05-07
US	51786058	R5CBDCTBO0XMM	0812564375	666062148	Mount Dragon	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Solid techno-thriller	This is another good effort by Preston and Child. The killer virus plot is nothing new, but it is done well here, as the the incidents continue to escalate in intensity, cranking up the suspense. Most of the characters are  interesting, although a little one-dimensional, as the story is more plot  driven. The book is paced well, with the first part setting up the story,  the second part building events up to a head, and the third part more  action oriented racing to the conclusion. One criticism would be the trite  romantic encounter towards the end between Carson and de Vacca that was all  too predictable, but really not necessary. A second criticism would be the  virtual reality bonanza at the end that was kind of cool, but not  alltogether believable. If you are a fan of this kind of book, or a fan of  Preston amd Child, you will enjoy Mount Dragon.	2000-05-01

I therefore had high expectations for this one. Unfortunately, those expectations were, for the most part, unfullfilled. The book started out intriguing enough, with  lots of action and suspense, but started to deteriorate and get crushed  under its own weight halfway through. For the most part the scenes with  Reacher, and Holly were interesting enough, but these were alternated with  scenes involving the FBI and military characters which were somewhat dull  and redundant at times. Those characters were very boring and those scenes  were unnecessary in many cases. And the bad guys were just plain stupid. If  they had any sense they would have simply killed Reacher, either when they  kidnapped Holly, or at the very least when they brought him back to the  camp. However then there would be no story, so Reacher is allowed to live  and wreck havoc on the villans. And Reacher himself, while interesting, is  a little too perfect, he knows all, sees all, and can do anything. There is  still some decent action and suspense through some parts of the book  though. It just would have been a lot better if it had been cut down, and  focussed more on the main characters instead of too much emphasis on the  supporting cast. I'll have to read another one of Child's novels to form a  final opinion on him.	2000-04-21

I recently discovered Coben with One False Move, which was so good I promptly picked up the rest of the series. And Deal Breaker is just as good if not better. A fast pace, exciting and twisting plot, hillarious wit, and  intriguing characters make for a fantastic read. Myron is a great lead  character, and Win is the perfect sociopathic sidekick. The sleazy bad guys  are great too. Deal Breaker is an outstanding mystery that will also leave  you laughing out loud at times. My only concern is what I'll do when I have  finished the whole series. I can't wait for the newest installment.	2000-04-19
US	51786058	R8CJBQIIPAEE1	0446519642	288479263	Burnt Sienna	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Excellent thriller	Morrell has long been a favorite author of mine, and although he slipped a little with his last book, he has delivered another winner in Burnt Sienna. Interesting characters, tons of suspense, and fast paced action make for a  great read that you will finish before you know it. Some of the events are  predictable, but the with the intrigue and intense action you won't care.  Morrell's writing is much better than most other books in the genre. If you  are a Morrell fan or just a thriller fan in general, pick this one up.	2000-04-04

Admittedly, he is not a fantastic writer, as is evident by the many cliches and sometimes stilted dialogue, but he is a very good storyteller and his  books are always fun to read. Typical save the world type thriller, but  with an interesting hook in the Prions, biological weapons targeting  specific ethnic groups. The main characters are interesting, but perhaps a  little too predictable. The books strength lies in the fast paced action,  and suspenseful twists. Fun read, if you overlook the flaws, which you  should because Cannell tells a good tale.	2000-03-27

I kept trying to get into it, but by the end I was speed reading just to find out what happened at the  end (not much). It is unfortunate, because Perry seems like he is probably  a good writer, but the story lacks any real suspense, tension, or  excitement. It is also very unbelievable, from the inital fact that Bernie  &quot;the elephant&quot; has the location of billions in mob money stored  only in his head (come on- it's the 90's), and when the money is given away  to charities, they not only catch on instantly, but they then launch a  nationwide net to catch Jane that would put the FBI to shame. Even the  action scenes were slow paced and uninspiring. Perhaps his other books are  better, because as I said, I think he could be a decent writer with a  different story.	2000-03-26

If you like Crais and Lehane, you should definitely give Coben a try. Myron Bolitair is a great character, a tough, wisecraking guy on the  outside, but vulnerable and sensitive at heart. The rest of the characters  are interesting as well. The plot is fast paced, with lots of twists, and a  susprising ending. Good descriptions of the setting, and many interesting  observations as well. I definitely look forward to reading the rest of the  series. This really is a book that will grab you, so make sure you have a  few hours free before you start it.	2000-03-25

After reading the jacket cover I didn't think that it would be all that good, but in the end it was a pretty solid book. Paul Madriani is a well written character, and the  supporting cast is fairly interesting for the most part. Lots of suspense  and action, and plenty of twists keep the book moving along at a fast pace.  I found some of the courtroom scenes to be a bit dull though. As well I am  not sure I totally buy the end. But these complaints aside, it is a good  and exciting read.	2000-03-23
US	51786058	R1XSAU2E7IIXY5	0060196092	752429507	Moment of Truth	Books	3	14	16	N	N	Very dissapointing effort	Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of Scottoline, and have enjoyed her previous works a lot. Her books are normally fast, funny, and suspenseful, with lots of interesting twists. Unfortunately, this one seems  to be stretched too thin, and is flat right from the start. It is obvious  who the killer is right away, and the way it is tied together at the end is  really contrived and unbelievable. None of the characters are particularaly  interesting either; even Mary who was a good character in previous books.  And then there is the daughter who is pregnant and worried about the baby,  yet has no qualms about doing drugs. The only reason for the three stars is  to give Scottoline the benefit of the doubt, because as I said, I have  always enjoyed her books in the past. Hopefully she will return to form  next time.	2000-03-23
US	51786058	R3TX9JKM9AODLS	0525944796	184026856	Above the Law (Luke Garrison)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Freedman excellent as always!	I have read all of Freedmans novels, and they are consistently of a much higher quality than many other more popular authors. For whatever reason he doesn't seem to get the recognition that he deserves. He should be a  &quot;top 10&quot; author, but for whatever reason you never really hear  much about him.<br />Above the Law is another winner. Freedman creates rich,  interesting characters who are also flawed and believeable, rather than the  typical one-dimensional and perfect characters that appear in so many other  books. He also writes excellent descriptions about people and places,  giving lots of detail without bogging down the story. The plot is fast  paced and exciting without a dull moment. Above the Law also examinines  many legal and moral issues, adding another dimension to an already  fantastic book. A well written, absorbing tale that you should not miss.	2000-03-02

Requiem (Elvis Cole)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Crais delivers the goods again	I first discovered Crais not all that long ago, and since then I have been hooked. Elvis Cole is a fantastic character. He is tough, but sensitive and funny, smart, but realistic and he has his flaws as well, which are  examined much more closely this time. Joe Pike is also a great character,  and this time we get to see what makes him the way he is, how he uses his  quiet, tough demeanor to shield against his troubled past. And of course,  the cat is pretty cool too. In L.A. Requiem, the supporting cast is  stereotypical in many respects, but for the most part they are depicted  pretty well. Samantha Dolan as a cop who is after Elvis romantically is a  nice addition to the story.<br />The plot this time out is much more ambitious  than previous novels. Rather than the typical missing person case, it is a  serial killer on the loose this time. There is a much darker, more serious  tone to this book than previously encountered. There is still the requisite  humor and wisecracks from Elvis, but they are toned down somewhat. Also  absent is the usual happy ending. This time around Elvis is left with his  world turned upside down and needing to re-evaluate his life. Definitely  recomended. If you are an Elvis fan you already know about it, if not than  read it and become one.	2000-02-22

Lets start by saying that this book definitely doesn't qualify as &quot;literature&quot;. If you are looking for something more refined, look elsewhere. But if you want a quick, fun, wild read you should pick this  book up. The book reads a lot like one of Barry's columns, which isn't  really a bad thing. The plot, while requiring suspension of disbelief, is  interesting. And although the characters lack any real depth, they are also  interesting, and funny. Expect rampaging goats, bumbling assassins; giant,  dog tormenting toads, &quot;killer&quot; squirt guns, and much more. The  only part that didn't work as well was the final scene at the airport which  seemed kind of hurried. Overall, a very funny book that is a good way to  spend an evening. Don't read it in public, however, or people may look at  you funny when you fall over laughing.	2000-02-18
US	51786058	R10G9ZHMSZGZNU	0312203837	58250960	Rough Draft	Books	4	9	10	N	N	good book, but cliched ending	This was my first James Hall book, and I plan to read some more in the future as he seems to be a very good writer. His writing flows clean and easy, making for a fast paced read. The main characters Hannah and Frank  were good, but I would have liked to see a little more depth into Frank.  Hal and Misty are also good villians, but Hal is perhaps a bit cartoonish,  particularily his method of killing. The plot was interesting and had some  original ideas compared to the typical plot in the genre. The only problem  was that you could see how it would end from a mile away. Although the  identity of Hannah's parents killer was a nice suprise. Overall, a good  read.	2000-02-16

False Memory is definitely one of the best books that I have read recently. The plot was very interesting, but scary to think that it could actually happen in reality (maybe). Martie and Dusty are very likeable  characters who you can feel some attachment to, while Dr. Ahriham is a  scary yet all-too real villian. The book, although very long, moves at a  fast pace, full of excitement and suspense. There are a lot of thought  provoking situations in the book that make you consider just how fragile  the human mind is, and what someone with the proper knowledge could  actually be capable of. I have read and enjoyed the majority of Koontz's  books, and for sure this is one of his best. I would personally rank it up  with Seize the Night and Fear Nothing, which are my other favorites. But as  I said, it definitely gives you second thoughts about going to the doctor  anytime soon after reading it. But if you start having weird nightmares and  losing bits of time, don't say you weren't warned!	2000-02-13
US	51786058	R67TEKWBLV93	0380804557	26552478	Stardust	Books	5	2	3	N	N	An enjoyable tale	The most impressive aspect of Stardust is that it is a refreshing break from the norm. As far as fairy tales go, there are many familiar aspects to it, but all with a fresh twist. Stardust is a very easy read, but not a  mindless one. It is well written and the story flows effortlessly, but  there is a subtle complexity throughout. The book is full of intriging  characters and interesting places. Even though you pretty much know how  things will end, the story is so interesting, unique, and charming that  once you start you want to keep reading until you are finished. And there  is enough adventure and suprise along the way to keep the book in your  hands until you have. Gaiman has again managed to write a very distinctive  book that stands out from the crowd with originality and flair.	2000-02-09
US	51786058	REFHTWU81FQDX	067945960X	625404653	Monster: A Novel	Books	2	24	31	N	N	Monster has no bite	Generaly speaking, I enjoy the Alex Delaware series, but after reading this book I am looking forawrd to more non-Delaware books by Kellerman. Monster is well enough written, however the material isn't exactly  exciting. It starts off decently enough, but starts going downhill about a  quarter of the way in, and crashes in flames around the middle. The bulk of  the story involves Delaware checking into the past history of a group of  people from a small town which no longer exists. The main problem being is  that these characters are pretty much all dead and have no place in the  current context of the story, and you spend a couple hundred pages reading  about people who you really don't have any interest in. On top of that, the  story is so convoluted, by the time you get near the end, you have lost any  focus, and interest, and really don't care what happens. Overall, it is a  slow moving, uninteresting, implausible story that I would not recommend  unless you are  a diehard Kellerman fan. Hopefully his next book will be a  non-Delaware book, as Alex  needs a longer hiatus.	2000-01-31

It seems like a long time, but then again, at 673 pages, it probably took  Demille some time to write it. I am happy to say that the wait was worth  it, however. Unlike some other big name authors who have been writing  quickly but producing sub par work (ie. Cornwell, Baldacci, etc.), Demille  has turned up another winner. The writing is fantastic; Great characters  and dialogue, and an excellent fast-paced story. I also love the use of  humor in the book. Corey is hillarious with all of his smart-ass sarcastic  remarks. The humor is refreshing, as so many books take themselves too  seriously, and end up becoming somewhat dull. The Lions Game is anything  but dull though. It is an exciting, engrossing, nasty, intelligent book  that can be summed up nicely by the cliche &quot;I couldn't put it  down&quot; Read it, or you will regret it.	2000-01-19

I think the book was maybe rushed somewhat, as there are some holes in the story,  and some parts are not really explained particularaly well. For instance,  sometimes you flip the page and find that months have passed in the story  without even realizing it. And the entire section with the court scenes was  really oversimplified. The ending seemed very contrived as well, as if  Patterson decided he didn't want to write any further. I liked the bad guy,  he was actually comical at times (like when he fed his family a super spicy  meal just because he knew they would hate it). <br />Criticisms aside, overall  Pop goes the weasel is a pretty good read and I would recommend it,  especially to fans of the series. It is better than his last book, but  still not up to par with the first three books in the series, which were  all outstanding; Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider remain two of my  all time favorites - and I read a lot of books.	2000-01-18

I was really looking forward to this book, butunfortunately Baldacci is continuing the downward trend started by his last effort. Basically, his first three books were great, his last was pretty good, however Saving  Faith is simply mediocre. Number one, the plot is poor. It really doesn't  make any sense and it is very thin. Two, the characters are very  one-dimensional and dull, with the exception of Thornhill (he is simply  assinine). I wouldn't have really cared if someone had of come in and  killed a bunch of them off- it might have been welcomed, in fact. Number  three, the book is way too long- take out all the filler and you could  probably cut out minimum 50 pages. It seemed as though Baldacci did a lot  of research that he felt was necessary to stick in even though it bogged  down the plot and cut out any possible excitement or suspense. For example,  almost every chapter with Buchanan is virtually pointless except to take up  page after page with all of the information Baldacci researched about  politics in Washington. And finally, there really were no major twists at  all, or any suprises much either. Although it does get better towards the  end. <br />Having said all of this, it still isn't really a BAD book, but I  expected much more form Baldacci; there just isn't anything to set it apart  from other, much better books. It is in a word, mediocre. If you haven't  read Baldacci before you definitely should read one of his earlier books.	2000-01-17

The plot was outrageous, but everything fit together very well. It follows along the lines of a Leonard or Hiassen book, but its a bit wackier perhaps, not as subtle. Barry comes out  swinging for the fence in this one, and although the writing itself is not  quite as good as Hiassen, etc.(it is his first novel after all), the book  doent't miss a beat. The characters themselves are not really well defined,  but the book takes place over only a day or two, so that isn't a big  problem. The book is more plot and dialogue driven anyway. I noticed that  many people were complaining about the language in the book, but I feel  that is ridiculous and unjustified - stop being such prudes! Some of the  characters are pretty shady guys - I don't think that they would likely  speak politely. The only complaint was the ending in the airport seemed a  bit rushed, and kind of jumbled. It could have been handled much better.  But nonetheless, it is a very enjoyable book with a lot of laughs.	2000-01-17

So unfortunately I did not read them in order, but I would recommend that for someone just starting the series. It is not necessary in order to follow  along, but it helps to form continuity, and also endings from earlier books  are sometimes given away in the later books. But back to this book, it is  the latest in a series of outatanding books. It has all the ingredients you  could ask for - great characters, fast paced, many twists and turns, and a  fantastic writing style that adds to the book with fascinating insights  into the human soul, society, and morality. And best of all, everybodys  favorite psychopath, Bubba, has an expanded role in this one. Lehane is one  of the best writers around today.	2000-01-10

Even his &quot;bad&quot; books are as good as many other authors best efforts. And while Void Moon is not up to his best work, it is nonetheless a very  good read. The characters are all well written, although I did not  particularly care for the character of Jack Karch. There was something  missing with him and I found him a little flat. But the plot is very  exciting and fast paced, and I finished the book the same day I started it.  My main problem was with a few of the events at the end of the book. I  don't want to give anything away, but I found some of it a bit contrived.  The book is perhaps a little simplistic compared to some of Connelly's  other books. Overall though it is very good, and I would recommend it.	1999-12-29

He is simply a masterful writer. While I am a huge fan of authors such as Patterson, Baldacci, and Cornwell, none of them can touch Lehane for pure  writing ability. And he doesn't lose anything when it comes to plot or  characters either. This book is a rollercoaster of ups and downs and Lehane  writes with an amazing insight that really makes you think twice. He is  also excellent at injecting bits of humor throughout. My only problem with  this book was not enough of Bubba - that guy kills me! This is definitely a  &quot;first tier&quot; book from a &quot;first tier&quot; author (in  response to an earlier review!)	1999-12-29

It is full of great characters, and unique, funny situations. Some people have complained about the material - the main plot centers on rascism, and  militias. However, they are missing the point that those characters  promoting the rascism are made out to be complete idiots with the IQ of a  baked potato. The humor comes from poking fun at these guys, not from the  material itself. <br />My only problem was that while the story was fast  paced, the subplots were overused. While they were interesting, they should  have been cut back by about a third because the book ends up dragging on a  bit too long, with the ending somewhat anti-climatic. But it is still very  good, and highly recommended for an enjoyable read with lots of laughs.	1999-12-26

I kept trying to continue reading further, but decided that it would be an exercise in  masochisim to do so. It was simply boring, rambling on and on  about nothing - boring characters and dull material. As well, the narration  style was very awkward.

Freedman puts many other authors to shame, many of which get a lot more recognition than he does. Grisham for instance, is a good author, and I like his books, but  Freedman is definitely a better writer. He writes with a lot more depth  than others. Maybe that is his problem; his books require a little more  thought and are a bit more subtle. But as far as I am concerned, he should  be right up there with Grisham, Connolly, Baldacci, Patterson, etc.	1999-09-26

Many times you find yourself wondering how, or why something  happened because when you think back to other events it just makes no  sense. And some of the events are very implausible as well. The murders at  the start of the book are a good example of this if you really think about  it. <br />On top of this, the writing isn't particularally good either. He  jumps around with multiple viewpoints in almost every scene for starters.  And many sections are not really clear either, you end up reading over  parts twice to figure out what is happening. Still, the book isn't that  bad. It is definitely readable if you like this kind of thriller, but there  are a lot of better options. It will probably make a good movie someday.	1999-03-29

A hundred pages into the book, there still isn't any semblance of a plot. It also seems as though there are new characters in every  chapter and you can get confused as to who is who because none of them seem  any different from each other.

I must admit, when I started reading this one, I certainly didn't expect the story that transpired. It is a thriller in the vein of the X-Files more than anything else. And as far as the actual writing is concerned, it is  not up to Patterson's usual standards. The writing is very simplistic, and  the character development isn't particularily great. So why 4 stars?  Despite it's flaws, it is still an interesting and fast paced book. It's  kind of like a Schwarzenegger movie - it won't win any awards, but it is  stoill a fun, fast ride to the end.	1999-02-16

What I most like about these books is that while they are serious, they don't take  themselves too seriously. They have a good mix of wit and humor to go with  the more serious parts. It's a good, fast paced book as  well, without many  boring parts breaking up the action. The only thing that wasn't that great  was the ending. It seemed to be somewhat contrived, and seemingly from out  of nowhere, Kincaid had all the answers. But overall, highly recommended.	1999-02-12

Until I got to the last quarter of the book I was thinking that it was good, but not great and I was leaning towards 3 stars. However, the great plot twists at the end prompted me to reconsider. The main problem that I  did have with it though, was the fact that both the killer, and Lincoln  Rhyme who is the good guy, both seemed as though they should be working for  the psychic friends network. They both seemed to always figure things out  based on virtually nothing but gut instinct. This is fine a few times, but  when it happens constantly throughout you start to question it.  Nonetheless, the book is good, the ending great, so read it and you will  like it.	1999-02-09

A true summation would be unfit to print here! I would have thought that after Hornets Nest, Cornwell would have learned her lesson - apparently that would have been  asking too much though. Much like HN, this one has no discernable plot,  idiotic characters, and basically goes nowhere from start to finish. I  can't believe that this book was even published, doing so is unfair to avid  fans. <br />Publishing this pure garbage is a money grab by Cornwell, who is  obviously riding on her reputation these days. Even her last Scarpetta  novel was a rehash of previous ones. She better smarten up, or else she  will permanently ruin her reputation. Many fans are probably already fed up  with her. I couldn't even finish this one - which is very unusual for me.  Your time would be better spent staring at a blank wall for a few hours! I  am just glad that I picked this up at the library, because you would be  better off burning your money than purchasing this book. Her next book  should come with a refund for anyone who bought this one!	1999-02-06

The plot and characters were both interesting, and it was fun trying to guess who the  real killer was - although it turns out I was correct on my first guess.  What was really good about this book, though, was that it had some really  humorous moments in it that offset the serious parts very well. This was my  first Bernhardt book, but I am looking forward to reading the rest of his  books.	1999-01-29

I am glad that Kellerman decided to take a break from the Alex Delaware series, and write about some new, original characters, as Delaware was beginning to get a bit stale. The best parts in this book are the scenes  with little Billy, and you want to read just a bit further to find out what  will happen to him next.  The book gets the most interesting, though, about  halfway through when a couple of scummy characters try to hunt doen Billy  to get the reward money. Kellerman also keeps you guessing till the end who  the real killer is.  Overall, an interesting and engrossing tale by a fine  author.	1999-01-27

However, after reading the book I was pleasantly suprised. No, the characters aren't particularly well-developed, and  perhaps some of their actions and decisions may not necessarily be  completely believeable, but the bottom line is that the book is  interesting, and a fun, easy read. I have read almost all of Woods' books,  and I would say that this one is among his better efforts. If you enjoy his  books, this one shouldn't dissapoint you.	1999-01-17

Tons of suspense, it constantly leaves you hanging, forcing you to read just a little more, and then a bit more still. Even though you know how it will turn out in the  end, the interesting and original story will keep you plugged in all the  way. Another excellent book that has a somewhat similar plot is Extreme  Measures by Michael Palmer.	1999-01-17
