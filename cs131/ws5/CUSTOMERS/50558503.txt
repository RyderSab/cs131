I use to weigh  380,and now I'm down to 200.I lost this weight on my own by starving,and  nearly killed myself.This book has helped me to regain the muscle I've  lost,and keep the fat off.One problem I do have is the Creatine. It's great  for building muscle,but gives me the runs.I had to stop taking this  product.I did find out,on my own,by eating more Steak,at least twice a  week,I have gotten stronger,and the muscles are starting to grow more.   This book helps you to become the best you can be,not someone else.Not all  of us are going to look like the models we see on TV,or in all thoes muscle  magazines.Also,I love the idea of cheating once a week.Bill tells you to  eat anything you want, and not to workout.There's only one thing Bill,or  any of the other diet books out there doesn't tell you.   If  you weighed  over 350 at one time,and  lose the weight,your going to have hanging skin  and fat for the rest of your life.You can't get rid of this through  workingout. I'm finally getting this operation done the last of June. You  can see  pictures of myself,before and after when my operations complet,and  how I went from 380 to 200 in my web-site on my members page.	2000-06-07

This book does give you the background of the Breed.I never knew the Airedale was a modern dog,being only a century or so old,and that the Otterhound was mated to either the now-extinct Tangrizzle Terrier,or the old Brokenhaired English Terrier to  make the Airedale Terrier. I have bought other books on the dog that gives  extra information,but this one is a must buy for anyone who owns a  Airdale,or any dog.It gives all dog owners helpfull information about  caring for your pet,and problems we all experience.	2000-03-28

This one has it all,from the Beatles,to the the most beutifull women of all time,Sharon Tate. Vincent Bugliosi gives you a inside look into the murder of Sharon,her unborn baby,and all of the  unlucky house guest that terrible August night.This could have been the  murder of Candace Bergman and her boyfriend,Doris Days son,Terry ,but they  moved out months before. We also get to read about the Beatles music from  the &quot;White Album.&quot; Charles Manson thought they were telling him   to get ready for the African American's taking over The country. The  songs,&quot;Helter Skelter,Sadie,BlackBird,&quot; and alot of the other  Beatles records are mention.The Beatles were even questioned about there  music. Even Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys has his house taken over by the  Manson Gang. The person I fill sorry for the most was the young man who  happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time,Steven.Nothing has ever  been written about him,or his family. One of the greatest women,Sharon  Tates Mom,Delores Tate,has fought for years untill her death to make sure  none of these murders ever get out of prison. Sharon Tates Sister has taken  over her quest.This is a long book,but even if you hate to read,you can't  put this one down.	2000-03-22

I really looked forward to reading Lorna Luft's book about her Mom,Judy Garland.After reading all the other fiction accounts by Ann Edwards,Mel Torme,and all the others to follow.Its a great book,and I have to beleive  what I read,but I did see one big lie in the Book,when Lorna said Liza  never gave her any credit for saving her life,and making her go to the  Betty Ford clinic.I have a 60mins tape were Liza gives Lorna all the credit  in the World for saving her life. I think the main reason Liza and Lorna  don't speak is because of Sid Luft. Liza knows he's nothing but a money  hungrey bum,still trying to make money off of her Mom. Also,I can't beleive  Danny Thomas was such a bad person. Everyone says what a saint he was.The  kids he has saved alone by The St Jude foundation.I think what we got here  is another fiction.	2000-03-18
