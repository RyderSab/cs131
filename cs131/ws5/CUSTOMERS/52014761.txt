From the cover photo of a country home on the south coast of Cornwall to the charming interior photos of homes reminiscent of the Balmerino and Aird homes in September, this is a delightful coffee table book that captures the essence of Pilcher country.<br /><br />Rosamunde writes most lovingly of how she found her home in the Bank House in Scotland and then treats the reader to page after page of impressive photos that will make you want to pack your bags and head straightaway for either the beaches of Cornwall or on to the romantic estates of Scotland.<br /><br />There are photos of an adult Rosamunde pegging her wash as Penelope might have in The Shell Seekers,  as a child playing with her sister on the beach in St. Ives, on her wedding day to Graham Pilcher and many more.  The cut-lines reveal the story of her mother-in-law who had a love life worthy of a Pilcher novel, her love for The Elms, the stately mansion where she grew up, and the inspiration for the settings in her novels and short stories.  Quotes from The Shell Seekers, September, Coming Home, The Empty House, Another View, The Day of the Storm, Wild Mountain Thyme and other works accompany the photographs.<br /><br />As well there are recipes for scones, treacle tart, creme brulee with raspberries, and more of the mouth-watering treats that have her readers yearning to sit in Penelope's kitchen or to be served tea by Violet Aird.<br /><br />There is a section of the paintings that inspired her, perhaps were even the inspiration for the work of Lawrence Stern in The Shell Seekers.  Most impressive to me was the painting of  Laura Knight which readers of Coming Home will remember is the one Gus thought of the first time he saw Loveday.<br /><br />The pictures of Scotland were equally impressive and since my favorite Pilcher novel is September, I was thrilled to see a home that might well have been Corriehill, the gala dancing which took me to Katy Steynton's birthday party, and the candle-lit table where Archie and Isobel entertained at dinner before the bash.<br /><br />Truly a  breathtaking book for armchair travellers in general, and readers of Rosamunde Pilcher novels in particular.ve and since my favorite Pilcher novel is September, I was thrilled to see a home that might well have been Corriehill, the gala dancing which took me to Katy Steynton's birthday party, and the candle-lit table where Archie and Isobel entertained at dinner before the bash. <br /> <br />Truly a  breathtaking book for armchair travellers in general, and readers of Rosamunde Pilcher novels in particular.	2005-10-02

The entertainment for the day is a seance which suggests that Captain Trevelyan, owner of the house, may be dead. The Captain has leased his home to a Mrs. Willett and her daughter Violet. These South African women had been so insistent on spending a typical British winter in the home that they convinced Trevelyan to move into a smaller home in nearby Exhampton. Major Burnaby, a friend of Trevelyan's, is present at the seance. Although he does not believe in spiritualism, he decides to check up on his friend and finds that Trevelyan has been murdered.<br /><br />From this intriguing beginning the story moves to Trevelyan's sister, two nephews, and niece, all of whom had motive and opportunity to commit the crime. Also, a convict has escaped from a nearby prison and is added to the list of suspects along with the mysterious Willetts.<br /><br />Christie weaves the murder beautifully into the novel's second plot which is the unexplained presence of the Willetts in Sittaford. This book, notable for its outstanding description of the stark and isolated setting, also introduces a gimmick that Christie will use again in her novella \\"Three Blind Mice.\\"	2005-10-02

I had never read a book by Nick Hornby, but couldn't imagine how such a serious subject could be treated lightly and still be in good taste.  Amazingly, Hornby seems to pull this feat off exceedingly well for even though you are saddened by their situations, the laugh-out-loud moments are many and the emotional delving that is done with intelligence and wit make this a rewarding read.<br /><br />The four protagonists are: Martin, a tv talk-show host whose antics invite public humiliation; Maureen, an older woman and mother of a son who is more vegetable than human; Jess, a young girl who redefines the term deranged personality; and JJ, an American rock star wannabe dropped by both his band and his girl.  When these four lost souls meet at the top of a London tower on New Year's Eve, a most unlikely bonding occurs.<br /><br />Hornby explores the reasons people are brought to the brink of suicide, the reasons some jump and some don't, and most importantly, what it is that makes unhappy people keep on plugging away at finding a better life.<br /><br />The writer does an excellent job of giving each of the protagonists a unique voice.  While the story is told in rotation by each of the four, the reader is never confused as to the person narrating, and that is a remarkable accomplishment, especially since he writes in first person as old, young, male, and female.<br /><br />Both grim and humorous, and liberally laced with pop culture references, this is a book you'll want to think about long after the last page is read.	2005-08-16

She has some pretty heavy baggage in a mother who can best be described as horrid, jealous, and vindictive, a milquetoast father who doesn't stand up to the mother for more than five minutes and can never quite commit to being on Kate's side, and a husband who just doesn't get it.<br /><br />But Kate has other things on her side:  an indomitable spirit; two friends who are treasures; a son she adores; and the life-long dream of a career in the domestic arts.<br /><br />Will she ever be able to win her mother's approval?  Or does it really matter?  Can she ever have a marriage in more than name only?  Or is there some way to break free?  Suffice it to say that Kate's journey is not an unusual one.  She encounters many common problems, yet Carrie Kabak's razor-sharp wit keeps the reader turning the pages and sticking with Kate through the ups and downs of an often troubled, often happy life.	2005-08-07

In one of his rare appearances on the shore, Ned meets a beautiful and seductive woman.  Hoping to have the money to live on her level, he consents to take part in a robbery with four of his oldest and dearest friends.  The plan is to rob a ritzy home of valuable artwork, but when the would-be thieves arrive, the art has already been stolen.  Later in the evening, the four friends plus the beautiful woman are all murdered and Ned is on the run.<br /><br />A female FBI agent that is attracted to Ned, a father with a lifetime record for petty crime, a malicious millionaire, an avenging spouse, and a gin partner who redefines friendship, are some of the characters you'll meet in this novel.  But it is Ned Kelly, the good guy with a bad streak, headstrong and often foolish, that will keep you reading at breakneck speed to discover who the elusive \\"Doctor Gachet\\" might be.  Surprising twists and Patterson's plotting keep things moving, but the over-the-top ending makes this more fairy-tale than thriller.	2005-07-27

THE GOLD COAST is a fast-paced, thrilling, and highly irreverent read set in a fabled and affluent section of Long Island. Life will never be the same for attorney John Sutter and his beautiful wife Susan after the most famous Mafia don of New York purchases the estate next door.<br /><br />John seems to have it all---a good profession, a quirky and sensual wife, an enviable estate---but he is facing the doldrums of a mid-life crisis and needs excitement in his life. Enter Frank Bellarosa, a man Sutter describes as \\"an unindicted and unconvicted felon as well as a citizen and a taxpayer. He is what federal prosecutors mean when they tell parolees not to consort with known criminals.\\"<br /><br />A chance meeting at the local nursery leads to friendship, to favors, to Sutter representing Bellarosa when he is charged for murder, and even to perjuring himself to save the Don.<br /><br />I haven't read as compelling a book about the Mafia since THE GODFATHER nor such a poignant tale of longing since THE GREAT GATSBY, both novels to which this has been compared.<br /><br />But it is DeMille's writing in the first person voice of John Sutter, his wickedly funny lines, his clever repartee, his upper class snobbery, his ability to capture the heart and soul of the Mafia don that lifts this book to greatness.<br /><br />DeMille's relentless foreshadowing of doom builds tension with each chapter until the reader is totally caught up in the life of John Sutter, his wife Susan, and the next door neighbor who both enhances and destroys their lives. I'm sure these characters will stay with me a long time and I will often remember John Sutter saying \\"Mamma Mia! It shouldn't happen to a High Episcopalian.\\"	2005-07-21

When Gracelin's father promises her in marriage to the wealthy Squire Donnelly, it appears she is headed for a life of luxury.

The unspeakable cruelty of the English and the horrible plight of the Irish make for a vivid and emotional reading experience, one that will give the reader tremendous insight into the problems that still plague Northern Ireland today.<br /><br />In addition to being a masterpiece of historical fiction, it is the amazing characters that elevate this novel to a totally-involving experience.  Gracelin herself is a heroine of epic proportions but also totally endearing are her crippled brother Sean, her remarkable friend Morgan, her beloved Mary Kate and many others that enrich this grim, yet extraordinary tale of the Irish people and the tenacity that led them through a horrible period.<br /><br />By novel's end you will be so caught up in Gracelin's story, that not reading the sequel, LEAVING IRELAND, will be unthinkable.	2005-07-05

Murder is the name of her game, having already poisoned her first husband and currently in the process of whipping up tainted entrees for her two latest conquests.  Nora is beautiful, seductive, and totally enthralling to men.  Capturing them is easy; the thrill comes with the murders and the transfer of their millions to her Cayman Island account.<br /><br />Will Nora meet her match in FBI agent John O'Hara?  Will she be able to seduce the professional man hand-picked to destroy her?  Will his cover be blown?  And who is the mother of those children he is taking to Yankee stadium?<br /><br />The novel races along with short, suspenseful chapters that keep the reader's adrenaline flowing and make it near impossible to quit turning the pages.<br /><br />O'Hara's father warned him that things aren't always the way they appear and many twists in this book give credence to that mantra.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that the author failed to let us know the contents of the letter Nora's mother, a husband-killer herself, wrote to her daughter.

It will come as no surprise to savvy readers that the staged murders soon convert to real-life murders and something strange is definitely afoot.  As one of the characters so succintly states, \\"The inmates have taken over the asylum.\\"<br /><br />In addition to the hosts and permanent residents of the manor, the visiting guests include a twin with a multiple personality disorder, a visiting American writer and his dominating mother, numerous actors hired by the touring company and others.  In fact, there are so many \\"others\\" that it is oftentimes confusing distinguishing characters and keeping track of the large ensemble.<br /><br />Babson does enlighten the reader with the history of the murder game, thought to have first been introduced into England by American Elsa Maxwell in the 1920's.  Maxwell herself admits she did not originate the game but borrowed the concept from American artist Neysa McMein of the famed Algonquin Round Table.  The game was immortalized in Ngaio Marsh's A MAN LAY DEAD (1934) and later in Agatha Christie's DEAD MAN'S FOLLY (1956).<br /><br />I don't think Babson's effort will reach classic status, but it is certainly a cozy way for a mystery lover to while away an afternoon.	2005-06-19

It is Huey who takes in runaway wife Rebecca and calls in his best friend, retired attorney Abigail Thurmond, to help Rebecca dissolve her marriage and get custody of her two children.  Abigail is quite a creation herself, a middle-aged woman battling depression and shouldering huge amounts of guilt over the deaths of both her son and her husband.  How Huey and Abigail find a purpose in life in helping Rebecca, how magnificently-drawn supporting characters like Charlene, the ultimate Redneck Woman, move the story along, and how life on Pawley's Island changes for the better, make this a most entertaining book.<br /><br />Thank you, Dot Frank.

Julia's life is not perfect and it's getting a whole lot worse.

Rabbit with his highly unlovable ways, his crude sexuality, his ethnic slurs, his disdain for the \\"dumb mutt\\" he married, all would normally tend to turn someone off, and yet Updike has made this anti-hero an endearing and enduring creation.  Rabbit is  the 20th century man in all his dysfunctional glory, who in spite of his many shortcomings, is like an old friend we are immensely fond of and want to keep up with.<br /><br />Though all the books are well-written, it is in this fourth and final installment that Rabbit and Updike both reach their peak and mesmerize the reader.  Rabbit at 55 is feeling the pains of a lifetime of beer-drinking and cholesterol-laden foods.  While on an outing with his granddaughter, he suffers his first heart attack and thus begins his long trip into the valley of death and the nostalgic trip down memory lane that so often precedes that.<br /><br />Looking back on his life, he decides it must be a religious tie that kept him with Janice as he can think of no other reason.  Rabbit and Janice are now leading \\"the good life\\" and while cocaine-addicted son Nelson runs Springer Motors, the senior Angstroms spend six months of the year in sunny Florida where Rabbit golfs and Janice plays tennis and attends a women's group regularly.  It is Janice that has changed most, making the best of her life with Rabbit while enjoying the carefree existence of a snowbird.  It is surprising to Rabbit when he discovers that, though outwardly together, to herself Janice will always be the woman who drowned her own daughter.<br /><br />Rabbit is still deeply interested in American  history, but it is his personal history  that haunts him-the daughter he thinks is his, the daughter he knows is his but  died, the son he can never connect with.  When Rabbit commits the ultimate betrayal of his son, he does what he does best, he runs.  In classic Rabbit style, he ignores his problems, ignores his doctor's advice, ignores the laws of common decency, and becomes his one and only soulmate.<br /><br />Rabbit's final run and his last days are some of the most angst-ridden yet best-written pages in contemporary American literature.  If anyone ever wants to know how it was to come of age in 1950's America and live through the 1990's, they have no better blueprint for tracing events than the story of Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom.In classic Rabbit style, he ignores his problems, ignores his doctor's advice, ignores the laws of common decency, and becomes his one and only soulmate. <br /> <br />Rabbit's final run and his last days are some of the most angst-ridden yet best-written pages in contemporary American literature.

He is what some would call a \\"serial husband,\\" a man who has no trouble attracting women and marrying them before they get to know him very well.  This deceptive and deeply unlikeable man is revealed in bits and pieces by the three women he marries.<br /><br />The first Mrs. Kimble is Birdie, a woman of the 50's who falls apart when he leaves her for a young girl.  She becomes a wino and neglects her two children, Charlie and Jody.  The second Mrs. Kimble is Joan, a bright and savvy career woman who is devastated when she is diagnosed with breast cancer.  Her mansion, her obvious wealth, and her family connections are enticing to the highly duplicitous  Ken Kimble.  The third Mrs. Kimble is the physically damaged Dinah, a woman half his age who bears him a son, Brendan, whom he neglects and serves merely as a trophy wife for him to trot out when needed.<br /><br />Throughout the three marriages, we are privvy to the life of firstborn son Charlie and the effects the father he barely remembers have on him. This empathetic character grows into manhood carrying the baggage of his youth, yet becomes a port in the storm to someone who needs shelter as much as he does.<br /><br />The three Mrs. Kimbles give the reader a look into traditional and non-traditional family values as well as answering a lot of questions about why women marry and why they make the choices they do.  The novel is totally engrossing and packs a powerful message on the vulnerability of women.	2005-05-19

She is left at a girls' school in England while her mother and younger sister Jess go to join Judith's father in Singapore.  The separation stretches on for years, and Judith grows through her teen years with the help of new-found friends, the affluent Carey-Lewises, but mostly survives due to her own indomitable spirit.<br /><br />There is so much to say about a book that goes on for nearly 1,000 pages, but for me the plot was secondary to the endearing characters who populate this book.  From Judith to her bestfriend, Loveday Carey-Lewis, the inspiriing Diana, the haunting Gus, the stable Jeremy and the host of minor characters who come to life, this is a riveting read that takes you through the trauma of war and its effects on ordinary people living their lives as best they can.

The pie I threw at Mark made a terrific mess, but a blueberry pie would have been even better, since it would have permanently ruined his new blazer.......so Rachel Samstat muses on her marriage to Mark Feldman.<br /><br />Nora Ephron's thinly disguised account of her marriage to famed Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein is laugh-out-loud funny in parts, though if you're looking for advice on how to save your marriage, the aforementioned tidbit is typical of the advice you'll get.<br /><br />Rachel is seven months pregnant with her second child when she learns her husband is not only having an affair with a mutual acquaintance, but has fallen in love with her. This indignity is compounded because, due to Rachel's advanced preganancy, she can't even date. She does manage one innocent flirtation on the subway which, in true slapstick fashion, leads to armed robbery. Ah, the perils of life flitting between New York and Washington.<br /><br />Short and savvy, this contemporary 80's novel is peppered with recipes since Rachel is a cookbook editor and host of her own cooking show. A collapsing marriage doesn't seem suitable for high-level comedy, but Nora Ephron makes it work and will have you laughing all the way to the bitter end.	2005-04-14

On the morning of September 11, 2001, Janet goes to the World Trade Center where she is a secretary and, in the devastating events of that day, is lost to her family forever. What follows is a heart wrenching insight into the numbness, the hopelessness, the rage that filled those left behind.<br /><br />Anyone who reads this book will have a hard time forgetting Wendy putting up fliers with her mother's picture on them, her regrets for all the ugly remarks she ever made to her mother, and most of all, her beautiful and haunting memories of time spent with her family.<br /><br />Wendy's biological father has been pretty much of a no-show in her life thus far, but when he learns Janet is missing he turns up and takes Wendy back to California with him and away from the only family she has ever known.<br /><br />What follows is the story of a strong young girl, a survivor of the highest order. Truly remarkable are the secondary characters that fill this story. Joyce Maynard has done a wonderful job of giving us three-dimensional characters we come to love and appreciate, people who help Wendy and reveal a lot about the basic goodness and terrible failings of human nature.  A young mother wrestling with giving up her baby, a middle-aged woman reunited with the child she gave up twenty years ago, a book store owner dealing with his autistic child, a drifter in search of his brother, a good friend who spills the secret about Janet's best friend, and a young clarinet player experiencing first love are some of the memorable characters that people this story.  But it is Wendy's two fathers, Josh in New York and Garrett in California, that are pivotal to the story.  Both loved Janet and both feel the need to take care of Wendy in quite different ways.  And most of all, there is Louis, the young brother who is such an important part of Wendy's life.  They shared a mother, but will they ever be able to live together again when they have such vastly different fathers who each live on opposite coasts.<br /><br />Out of sorrow and terrible tragedy comes a heartbreaking story that will have you in tears and yet hopeful.  You will be immediately pulled into this story and feel a part of the happy family life that is about to explode.  You will follow Wendy in her journey to California and ache with her as she misses not only the mother she will never see again, but the brother and stepfather now 3,000 miles away and removed from her life.

The Angstroms have achieved the American dream and are even the center of their own little clique at a country club established for the nouveau riche.<br /><br />If you remember the Carter era, gas shortages, Cheryl Ladd replacing Farrah Fawcett in \\"Charlie's Angels\\" and Toyota's \\"Oh, what a feeling!\\" commercials, you will love this look back at America in 1979 and into the early 80's.<br /><br />A fatter, richer Rabbit dabbles in gold and silver, plays golf, and wages war with his son Nelson, now a student at Kent State.  When Nelson drops out of college and returns home, Rabbit says, \\"I like having Nelson in the house.  It's great to have an enemy.  Sharpens your senses.\\"  Nelson is the worst of Rabbit, scared and running, torn between two women, impregnating and marrying one while too young to handle the responsibility, and taking off.<br /><br />Rabbit, though outwardly-satisfied and enjoying his affluent life, has never ceased mourning for what he cannot have.  A young girl who enters his Toyota dealership reminds him so much of himself and Ruth, his lover from RABBIT, RUN, that he is convinced she is the daughter he never knew and is restless until he can confront Ruth about her.  Janice, on the other hand, has matured into a suburban wife, playing tennis and lolling about the country club pool and in general convincing Rabbit to admit that the decade past has taught her more than it has taught him.<br /><br />The secondary characters in this installment are brilliant.  We see Charlie Stavros progressing into old age and running off to Florida with a young girl, but it is the Angstroms country club friends who provide the most decadent insight into the times as a group trip to the Caribbean becomes an adventure in wife-swapping and brings Rabbit nearer his dream of possessing the wife of his good buddy.<br /><br />Rabbit himself neatly sums up his existence when he says \\"At my age if you carried all the misery you've seen on your back you'd never get up in the morning.\\"  But get up he does, to strut another day at Springer Motors, to chase one more woman, to fight one more battle with Nelson, and in the final page to possess his heart's desire----but I'll leave that up you, good reader, to discover on your own what that desire is.up trip to the Caribbean becomes an adventure in wife-swapping and brings Rabbit nearer his dream of possessing the wife of his good buddy. <br /> <br />Rabbit himself neatly sums up his existence when he says \\"At my age if you carried all the misery you've seen on your back you'd never get up in the morning.\\"  But get up he does, to strut another day at Springer Motors, to chase one more woman, to fight one more battle with Nelson, and in the final page to possess his heart's desire----but I'll leave that up you, good reader, to discover on your own what that desire is.   <br />	2005-04-05

The writer is working on his latest novel, and Bradley has some ideas on how to best tell a story about love.  He is, after all, a self-proclaimed expert on the subject, having been divorced twice.  He proposes to send Charlie real people whose experiences he feels would make a great story.  And so begins a tale where ordinary people are plucked from obscurity and made exceptional by feats of love infused with passion and humor.<br /><br />The characters come to Charlie and speak:  Bradley's ex-wife Kathryn who left him for another woman; his second wife Diana who  succumbs to marriage despite an involvement with a married man; David, the married lover who refines and refutes Diana's story; Chloe, a young and free-spirited waitress at Jitters, Bradley's coffee house; Oscar, Chloe's multi-pierced lover and recovering junkie; Harry Ginsburg, Bradley's neighbor, a philosopher who spouts Kierkegaard; and Esther, his wife, who with Harry is in perpetual agony over their son Aaron.<br /><br />The comic misadventures of these characters, their sometimes tragic, sometimes uplifting, love affairs totally captivate the reader while the author slips in brilliant pearls of wisdom on life, loving, and the inability to find love.  This book explores the many facets of love, its elusiveness, its hopelessness, its fulfillment.  We are told that everybody intuits what love is and yet it cannot be spoken of directly.  And so the interviewer, Charlie Baxter, plucks these ordinary people from the town and lets them reveal how they were transformed by love. From the graphic sexual exploits of Chloe and Oscar to the hopeless romanticism of Bradley, this book is sexy and savvy, a veritable feast for all those who have loved and those who hope to love again.n. <br /> <br />	2005-03-19

Being a fan of womens books and the dilemmas facing contemporary women, I was attracted to the back cover which explains about the problems the women in this book will face (no listing of prestigious awards since the women in this club hate that type of thing.)<br /><br />Harriet, Nicole, Polly, Susan, and Clare come together once a month to read a book chosen by one of the members.  Some are heavy (My Antonia, The Alchemist) some are lighter and more contemporary (Heartburn) and some are classics (Rebecca).  Some are beloved by the members and one or two are branded as 'stinkers.'  The women have an interesting but brief discussion of each book which will be especially interesting if you have read the book being discussed.  If you haven't, that's ok too, as it is not essential to the storyline.  However, it is amazing how the women's lives mirror to various extents the books they read.  These are 21st century women facing real issues:  infertility, a cheating spouse, an unwed and pregnant daughter, a terminally ill parent, and a marriage whose flame has burned out.<br /><br />I loved getting to know these women and seeing how they worked out their problems over the course of the year.  They made choices I agreed with and choices I wanted to scream at them for.  But they managed to survive and thrive and give readers a relatively happy ending with lots of smiles and a few tears.<br /><br />Witty and engaging, this book shows female bonding at its best.	2005-03-08

SOONER OR LATER falls into her group of romantic suspense novels that feature a strong female lead, a dashing cop (in this case, newly retired and having purchased a California vineyard) and a psychopathic killer obsessed with the female.  What could be trite in the hands of a lesser writer becomes engrossing and spellbinding with Adler thanks to clever plotting, interesting back story on the characters, and likeable supporting characters.<br /><br />Ellie Duveen is a chef, trained in France, and owner of a charming French cafe where she cooks, waits tables, keeps the books, does whatever needed to become highly successful.  When our fiercely independent heroine crosses paths with the retired New York cop who has moved to California to start a wine-making business, the sparks are electric.  But can two people from such different worlds connect?  Will the city girl be able to find happiness with a man who has had enough of city life and only wants the quiet and solitude of his vineyard?  You bet, and the predictable path to romance makes for a highly enjoyable read.<br /><br />A psycho from the past, grisly murders, long-buried memories, a doting grandmother, and exquisite French cooking make this a most enjoyable novel that will not only have you on the edge of your seat with suspense but reveling in the romance as well.	2005-02-22

But Elizabeth Adler gives her characters such depth and backstory that I was hard-pressed to tear myself away from this one.<br /><br />Mallory Malone appears to be the woman who has it all.  She is attractive, rich, and host of a program which appears to be as popular as Oprah's.  When a series of grisly murders in the Boston area occur, homicide detective Harry Jordan enlists her help.  Naturally, Harry is not your average cop.  He comes from old Boston money and society, was once a lawyer, and lives in a glamourous home plus has an equally glamourous getaway place and drives a Jag.<br /><br />When the two meet, he begins to fall in love but cannot get past the hard and brittle veneer Mallory has encased herself in.  The reader knows these two are destined to be together and the trip there is well worth it.<br /><br />Fast-paced action, a psychopathic killer that wears Gucci loafers and expensive cashmere sweaters, and a retrospective look at Mallory's past that endears her to the reader, all combine to make this a most-appealing and quick read.<br /><br />And did I mention the dog.  Squeeze is about as lovable as any canine in fiction and lives up to his name in a thrilling climax.<br /><br />The plotting is quick and exciting, the romance is electric, and the total package makes for a highly enjoyable book.	2005-02-13

The youngest, Framboise, narrates the tale of her dysfunctinal mother and hints of a tragedy that drove the family from their home and brought the scorn of the entire village upon them.  The story is brilliantly plotted and even though I could not sympathize with the narrator, I was hooked on finding out the details of the tragedy which is given to us in bits and pieces through flashbacks.<br /><br />Framboise at nine is a spunky kid, full of grit and determination, but also extremely cold-hearted.  She is the young version of her dysfunctinal mother, a woman who does not show love, scolds constantly, and takes to her bed with horrid migraines for days on end.  Framboise learns how to initiate her mother's illness and is diabolical in plotting and carrying out her plans to make her mother sick and bed-ridden.  Meanwhile, she and her brother and sister are free to roam, meet up with Nazi soldiers and exchange gossip about their neighbors for chocolate, magazines, and other treats.  At what point the children realize they are collaborating with the enemy and sending their neighbors to death camps is not clear, but by the time they realize fully what they are doing they are so enchanted by one particular German solider that they do not care and can easily justify their actions to themselves.<br /><br />While we all know war is hell for those fighting at the front, this book examines the personal hell of civilians who become entangled with the enemy.  A brutal rape, a senseless drowning, and a terrifying witch-hunt all explode on the pages of this novel and leave the reader pondering what the French people must have felt during WWII.  To be part of the Resistance or to collaborate with the enemy is certainly a key factor in this novel.<br /><br />I thought the ending left several unanswered questions and an epilogue would definitely have been in order.  However, if you enjoy books where an old woman looks back on her childhood and tries to remember and set the record straight, you will enjoy this one.ght the ending left several unanswered questions and an epilogue would definitely have been in order.

He remains the perfect anti-hero, not very likeable yet someone the reader cannot help pulling for.  This book takes up 10 years after the first, and if you are expecting Rabbit to have straightened up and be living a good life, you will be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />He is living the humdrum existence of a printer, sharing drinks with his dad after work, watching his wife leave and begin an affair with a co-worker, and generally letting life come at him without showing much emotion or spunk.  His sister Mim, now a California call girl, quite succinctly tells him, \\"Everybody else has a life they try to fence in with some rules.  You just do what you feel like and then when it blows up or runs down you sit there and pout.\\"<br /><br />Rabbit loses most everything possible in this book---wife, home, job, lover---but seems complacent as ever and does not noticeably grieve.  If fact, he seems quite content to be curled up in his parent's home, eating peanut butter sandwiches, and wearing his old high school letterman's jacket.<br /><br />The book incorporates the real-life events of the time---the VietNam War, Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon, the racial riots that swept across America---and makes strong political and racial statements.  However, this is the part of the book that dragged due to the verbosity of Skeeter, the angry black character who insinuates himself into Rabbit's life.  Also present is Jill, an eighteen-year-old hippie who has run away from her wealthy parents and becomes daughter/lover to Rabbit.<br /><br />As in \\"Rabbit, Run,\\" a bizarre tragedy occurs three-quarters into the book.  Rabbit, however, emerges relatively unscathed and plods along in his everyman's life.<br /><br />Ruth and Jack Eccles make cameo appearances and there is a more in-depth look at Rabbit's parents, his sister, and Nelson. This is a great character-driven novel as the aimless and almost pathetic Rabbit moves through middle age.  With all lost at novel's end, he has nowhere to go but up.  Therefore, I am definitely looking forward to the next installment in this tetralogy.racter-driven novel as the aimless and almost pathetic Rabbit moves through middle age.

Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom was a high school superstar only a handful of years ago.  Now he is a young married father, trapped in the suburban 60's, unhappy with a cluttered house, a drunken wife, and a son who will never be the athlete he was.  Will this former basketball star find a way to make his life better, or will he run like a rabbit?  The title says it all and Harry Angstrom does indeed run whenever things don't go his way.<br /><br />Leaving the house to pick up his son, he impulsively drives from his Pennsylvania home to West Viriginia.  He wants to run to the sunny shores of Florida to live the life he feels he deserves.  Surely a man like Rabbit deserves more in life, or so he imagines.  Unable to complete this journey, he runs to his former coach, a tired and washed-up man who introduces him to a part-time prostitute.  Rabbit moves in with Ruth that very night and they begin a relationship they flaunt and thus humiliate his very pregnant wife and both sets of parents.<br /><br />Is there an ounce of unselfishness in Rabbit?  The reader may think so when he returns to his wife the night she goes into labor.  Their reunion is bittersweet and because in large part of Rabbit's inability to see beyond his own needs, their reunion burst apart in a senseless tragedy that is horrific but so beautifully written the reader is glued to the page hoping against hope this terrible thing is not happening.<br /><br />Will Rabbit be able to grow up and realize he is no longer the high school hero?  Will he be able to comfort his wife, to provide a home for her and his children?  Will he forsake Ruth, the hooker who accepts him as he is but is now pregnant with his child?  In which direction will Rabbit run this time?<br /><br />In addition to the novel's main character, Updike gives us as fine an array of secondary characters as can be found anywhere.  He elevates Janice and Ruth so that they are not stereotypical \\"bad wife\\" and \\"good-time girl\\" but sympathetic characters the reader can relate to.  Most notable among the secondary characters is the minister, Jack Eccles, who takes upon himself the task of saving Rabbit.  He becomes Rabbit's friend and marvels at the paradox of this character.  For example, after spending the first night with Ruth, Rabbit has the need to go home and get clean clothes as he cannot function unless his wardrobe is clean and pressed.  The minister inquires, \\"Why cling to that decency if trampling on the others is so easy?\\"  Thus lies the paradox of this restless anti-hero, one the reader cannot admire but cannot help but root for and not turn away from.  It is this same minister who so succintly sums up the essence of Rabbit when he lambasts him later by saying, \\"The truth is you're monstrously selfish. You're a coward. You don't care about right or wrong; you worship nothing except your own worst instincts.\\"  And therein lies the crux of Rabbit's character.<br /><br />The novel's second half is quite intense and on finishing it there is no way I could leave Rabbit and the supporting characters behind.  I had to know what happened, so immediately began the sequel RABBIT REDUX, the second in the four-part Rabbit series.  I admit that had I read this when it was first published I would have been let-down by the ending since I like tidy conclusions.

He relates the story of how he discovered Christmas in his heart while spending the holiday in Taiwan, a country which does not celebrate Christmas at all.<br /><br />He compiles his thoughts and introspections on Christmas and divides them into four seasons:  Advent, where Christmas asks if we are ready to make room for it in our hearts and give it access to our lives; the Eve, which is a tribute to the love and the sacrifices parents make as excited children lie in bed in anticipation of what is to come; the Morning when tattered paper and empty boxes symbolize a completion of the journey, a journey that is always more important than the destination; and the Night when a parent reflects and asks \\"Is it enough?\\" hoping that he has given his child enough magic to inspire, enough celebration to show the importance of family and community, and enough gifts to show the greatest gifts are received in the giving.<br /><br />This book is quite an eye-opener for parents who hope to share with their children the true meaning of The First Christmas and shows clearly why the First Gift of Christmas...a parent's love...is still the most important aspect of Christmas.  The book is very brief, easily read in a mere fifteen minutes, but its message will ideally last a lifetime.	2004-11-23

But if you're able to just enjoy it for what it is---a light and fluffy fairy tale where our heroine lives happily ever after---then you will enjoy this delightful tale of an ugly duckling who becomes a swan.<br /><br />Jemima Jones is about 100 pounds overweight, stuck in a dead-end job, treated like a maid by her rommates, and in love from afar with a handsome co-worker.  To combat her sadness and loneliness, she finds comfort in food.  Bacon sandwiches and chocolate heal her temporarily but Jemima basically has no social life, just a humdrum existence centered on food.<br /><br />When her office installs the internet, things change rapidly for Jemima.  Egged on by her co-workers Geraldine and the adored Ben, Jemima finds \\"love\\" online.  Here is where you must begin to suspend reality to accept that a gorgeous California hunk, rich and successful, would be so desperate for companionship that he becomes enchanted by an English girl he meets online.  When she sends him a highly-doctored photograph of herself as thin and blonde, he falls head over heels in love.  So you think this is possible?  Then you might also accept that Jemima drops around 80 pounds in a matter of three to four months, becomes obsessed with exercise, and never has cravings for bacon or chocolate again. Impossible as it seems, she becomes the girl in the photograph.  Although it happens much too quickly and easily to be believable, I was rooting so hard for the sympathetic Jemima that I couldn't stop turning the pages to see what would happen next.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that Jemima learns all-too-sadly that even the thin and the beautiful have problems.  She travels from London to LA to meet her internet romance and fall in love, only to have a strange and bizarre twist leave her devastated and confused in a foreign country.  Watching Jemima survive and thrive is enjoyable, but keep in mind my favorite story as a child was \\"Cinderella\\" and I still believe in \\"happily ever after.\\"  Although it was a great read for me, I can easily understand how a reader could be put off by the mixed message this book sends on what makes women happy and what makes men take notice.y as a child was \\"Cinderella\\" and I still believe in \\"happily ever after.\\"  Although it was a great read for me, I can easily understand how a reader could be put off by the mixed message this book sends on what makes women happy and what makes men take notice.	2004-11-23

After being mugged in France, she decides to open her own detective agency.  She's no Sam Spade, however, and what people are hiring her for is mainly to find missing cats and runaway teens.  That is, until the very wealthy Mrs. Laggatt-Brown enters her office.  Raisin Investigations is off and running in a slightly madcap, slightly convoluted, but always entertaining story.  Discovering who wants to murder Mrs. Laggatt-Brown's daughter and preventing the murder consumes Agatha and her staff.<br /><br />Agatha still retains her biting humor but does appear to be softening a bit.  She not only worries over losing friends, but she actually breaks down and cries in this one.<br /><br />As always, there is a love interest.  But devoted followers of the series will be relieved to know that finally a woman, and not a potential lover, has moved into the cottage next door.  Will Agatha bond with new neighbor Emma Comfrey or will the cottage be up for sale yet again?<br /><br />All the series favorites are in this one---Ron Silver is down from London and more flamboyant than ever, Mrs. Bloxby is there with her always comforting shoulder to cry on, and Bill Wong aids and abets Agatha's antics once again.  Most interesting of all, we are finally given an inside look at the home life of Sir Charles Fraith and his aunt and manservant provide a lot of the biting humor.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent addition to a most enjoyable series.  One that leaves us wanting more, more, more of the wacky Agatha.	2004-11-07

The deceptively simple story  is told in a witty and light-hearted manner, but delves into such emotionally-charged issues as lesbian relationships, the treatment of minorities, the problems of aging and more in an unforgettable narrative.<br /><br />The story moves effortlessly between two time frames.  The first story begins in the 1920's and centers on Idgie Threadgoode, a female Huck Finn, and her friend Ruth Jamison.  Together, they own and operate the cafe which is the center of small-town life in Whistle Stop, Alabama.<br /><br />The second story begins in 1985 when Evelyn Couch meets Ninny Threadgoode, the now-elderly sister-in-law of Idgie, at the Rose Terrace Nursing Home in Birmingham.<br /><br />The two stories unfold in a light-hearted, folksy way that puts you into the lives of these poignant charaters and has you longing for the neighborly friendliness of a time long past.  Evelyn is, in fact, so touched by Ninny's recollections that she is finally able to take control of her own life through the often hilarious and always inspiring life of Idgie.<br /><br />For a feel-good read where the inherent goodness of people causes them to carry on through good times and bad, I highly recommend this one.	2004-10-29

I don't normally jump into the middle of things, but I wanted a cozy Christmas mystery, and this one was perfect.<br /><br />Lori Shepherd Willis is the heroine of this tale.  She is looking forward to celebrating the holiday in the manner in which her late and beloved father would have.  She is about to embark on a merry whirl of shopping, decorating, and baking his famous angel cookies in preparations for a lavish Christmas Eve party.  Her plans all go awry, however, when a handsome stranger is found unconscious in the snow outside her home.<br /><br />Lori's unexplainable attraction to the stranger coupled with a chance meeting with a Catholic priest lead her on a hunt to discover the story behind the tattered stranger and why he happened to collapse at her cottage.  At times reminiscent of a grown-up Nancy Drew, Lori's quest to find the answers is a fun and cozy Christmas read that packs a powerful message about helping others and opening your heart to the true message of Christmas.<br /><br />From WWII medals to a widow's farm and a London socialite, this book is a pure delight as Lori faces some unpleasant truths about herself and learns to share her blessings.  Aunt Dimity, gone but never forgotten, adds her own special wisdom via a most unusual blue journal. Highly recommended for a cold winter's night.

The description of the city's bustling excitement, the frenzied holiday preparations, and the loneliness of those without family is portrayed as a series of bizarre murders plague the area.  As brutal and grotesque as those of Jack the Ripper, these crimes have the police puzzled and the tenants on guard.

The reader learns everything but the identity of the killer which is, of course, revealed at a lavish and old-fashioned Christmas dinner.<br /><br />Delightfully cozy and filled with yuletide spirit, not to mention 12 malicious murders, this is a holiday treat for mystery fans.	2004-10-18

I am amazed that Sophie Kinsella can keep the humor and laughter coming with this ditzy character, but she does.  Frankly, I felt this was the best of the series thus far.<br /><br />We meet up with Becky and Luke in the 10th month of their round-the-world honeymoon.  When an invitation to the christening for Suze's twins arrive, the travellers decide to head back to London.  Of course, there are a couple of stops along the way, like Milan where Becky studies \\"local artifcacts\\" (Versace shoes) and lands the biggest fashion coup of the year by claiming a genuine Angel handbag thanks to a lot of help from a somewhat shady character who will, needless to say, be back for a proper thank you.<br /><br />Becky's return is not what she envisioned, however.  Not only has Suze acquired a new best friend, but her parents are acting very strange.  For good reason as it turns out.  A previously unknown sister has emerged from the past.  Seems Daddy Bloomwood was quite the rogue before he met Mama Bloomwood.  Becky immediately begins to fantasize about replacing Suze with this new sister.  She dreams of watching chick flicks, eating peppermint creams, laughing, and most of all, shopping with her new-found sister Jess.  Alas, Jess is not at all compatible with Becky.  Not only is she a dedicated activist and rock collector, she is....dare we use the word.......FRUGAL!  And she does not approve of Becky's addiction to shopping at all.<br /><br />Their relationship makes for lots of laugh-out-loud moments and even a few misty-eyed ones.  Following their relationship's development and explosion is a true trip into the heart of Becky Bloomwood and what makes her a character millions have fallen in love with.<br /><br />So if you want to see Becky running barefoot over hot coals to get a 5-carat aquamarine at half price, interfering in Luke's business and placing him in an insufferable position,  and taking the hiking trip to end all hiking trips, pick up the latest issue in this always-delightful series.nd taking the hiking trip to end all hiking trips, pick up the latest issue in this always-delightful series.	2004-10-10

You couldn't possibly be my beloved Maeve Binchy.  Maeve has always given us original Irish tales told with classic twists, memorable characters, and heart-stopping moments.  Maeve always left us with something to reflect on and a deep yearning for her next release.<br /><br />Maeve has obviously been the victim of identity theft and that person has written a contrived situation with paper-thin characters who are not very likeable and whose problems are strictly of their own making.  Maeve's characters were always more deeply developed, were good people with a tragic flaw perhaps, but after much soul-searching and a lot of Irish pluck managed to land butter-side up and delight the reader.  Not so with this book.<br /><br />Not only are we given one-dimensional characters, but they are bonded by a situation so far-fetched that I am questioning myself for continuing with this drivel.  Only because the cover claims Maeve Binchy wrote this do I proceed.  It's entertaining enough for a beach read or an otherwise boring flight.  There are moments when I think, \\"Oh, Maeve did write that part.\\"  And there is one character, Vonni, who has a striking resemblance to the unforgettable Signora from EVENING CLASS.  But, for the most part, this highly predictable novel falls far short of what Maeve Binchy is capable of.<br /><br />Four tourists representing the US, England, Ireland, and Germany being thrown together in the Greek isles and mixing with the locals seems a wonderful idea.  But perhaps Maeve's greatest strength lies deep in the Dublin she has written about with such love and insight.  I hope she takes us back there soon.<br /><br />If you are new to Maeve Binchy's work, please don't judge her by this one.  Read Circle of Friends, Light A Penny Candle, anything else she has written. I love all her other novels and short stories and consider this just a minor blip on the radar screen of a wonderful writing career.<br />	2004-10-06

Happily, he has equalled, if not exceeded, his earlier effort.<br /><br />The realities of old age manifest themselves in the form of Mead, a WWII veteran dealing with wartime memories that won't let go and the death of Sophie, his wife of fifty-one years.  His life has become a boring wait, waiting to join Sophie.<br /><br />But one day his daughter calls from Chicago bemoaning the fact her son Andrew has been expelled from high school.  She is a single mother who has reached the end of her resources and desperately needs help.  Mead offers to take his grandson into his Santa Monica home and give his daughter a break.<br /><br />Never was the generation gap more apparent than with Andrew and Mead in their first weeks together.  Andrew arrives with bleached hair, jeans bagging below a decent level, and an earring.  He is a pitiful sight with a terrible case of acne and a huge chip on his shoulder.  Mead cannot believe his grandson has pulled a knife on another kid at school or that his nice normal life has produced a kid who looks like Andrew.<br /><br />Andrew is not exactly thrilled to be with his grandfather either.  He has been relentlessly bullied in school and only after his only friend commits suicide does he retaliate by pulling a knife on the chief bullier.<br /><br />This unlikely duo seems destined for misery and is only slightly helped by an elderly woman who lives across the street from Mead and can see the goodness in both men.  A near-tragedy shocks Mead out of his complacent life and forces him to act in order to save his grandson.  Hoping to show him what a wonderful life he has and how much he has to be thankful for, he takes him on a trip to the famous battlegrounds of Europe including Normandy where Mead parachuted in on the D-Day invasion.<br /><br />Jonathan Hull has done a remarkable job of getting inside the head of both characters, of showing the obstinancy and fear both have, and the slow and wary way they come to see the other person's heartache.  For both have demons to exorcise and each will have to learn to lean on the other for the strength necessary.<br /><br />A beautifully told tale of the hardship of aging with dignity, the trauma of being an outsider, the tragedy of losing those closest to you, and the memories that must be let go of in order to face the future unafraid.<br /><br />From his graphic descriptions of wartime to his humorous look at how it feels to go to the beach with your grandfather, Jonathan Hull gives the reader something to think about, to reflect upon, and to cherish.n Hull has done a remarkable job of getting inside the head of both characters, of showing the obstinancy and fear both have, and the slow and wary way they come to see the other person's heartache.

One of his first stops is to see his dearest friend Hercule Poirot.  The timing is perfect, as Poirot has been presented with one of his most unusual cases, a supreme exercise for the little grey cells.<br /><br />Apparently, a homicidial maniac is terrorizing England as he taunts Poirot with advance notice of the time and place of his next murder.  Because the victims and towns they live in occur in alphabetical order (Mrs. Ascher is killed in Andover, Miss Barnard in Bexhill, Mr. Clarke in Churston, etc.) and because the killer leaves an ABC Railway Guide at each murder scene, the case becomes known as the the ABC murders.<br /><br />The set-up of this novel deviates from the normal Christie in that while Captain Hastings narrates the story as it has occurred, the reader is also privvy to the comings and goings of the rather strange Mr. Alexander Bonaparte Cust (notice the initials).<br /><br />The humor is rampant as Poirot and Hastings chide each other over Poirot's dyed hair, Hastings uncanny ability to see the obvious without realizing it, and the unabashed appreciation both men have for a beautiful woman.

At a book signing with the author that I attended recently, she said that a large segment of our population is made up of people who find themselves at a dead-end in middle age.  Whether through divorce, death of a spouse, or never having married, these people need to forge a new path and make a better life for themselves.<br /><br />Linda Breland is such a woman.  A divorced New Jersey mom of two teen daughters, she is finding living from paycheck-to-paycheck frustrating and unfulfilling.  Missing the closeness she needs to have with her daughters and depressed by her dead-end job, she is horrified to find contraceptives in her fifteen-year-old's makeup bag.  At the end of her rope and desperate for a simpler life, she packs the family up and drives from New Jersey to her native South Carolina.  There she finds the support system she needs in the form of her sister.  Then she finds a job managing a restaurant and widens her circle of friends with some delightful characters, not the least of whom is restaurant owner Brad Jackson who has a rather messy marriage in his past and a teenage son.<br /><br />How Linda learns to jumpstart her life, make friends, and find a deeper mother/daughter bond with her daughters makes for a light but uplifting read for everyone who has thought, \\"I deserve better!\\"<br /><br />A special bonus for devoted readers of Dorothea Benton Frank is that some favorite characters from SULLIVAN'S ISLAND and ISLE OF PALMS make cameo appearances in this one.<br /><br />My only complaint with this novel is the ending was evident from the very beginning.  I would have liked to have had more of the unexpected.

I read this because several people recommended it as a beautifully written love story.  Interestingly enough, I wound up liking it more for the time travel aspect than the love story angle.<br /><br />Clare, the protagonist, loves time-traveling Henry from age 6 when she first meets him in a meadow by her home.  He is 36 at the time, although in real time he is only 8 years older than Clare.  Theirs is a mostly strange, but often wonderful relationship that lasts.....well, I would spoil the ending if I told you how long it lasted.  When they meet in real time, Clare knows him but he has not met her yet.  Sound confusing?  It is.  But once you get into the rhythm of the story, a lot of the confusion disappears and you get to know these two people.  They are not particularly likeable, often aggressive and maniupulative of people and situations.  But Henry has a horrific death (his mother's) to deal with coupled with an alcoholic father who stopped existing when his wife was killed.  Clare is his anchor throughout all his ups and downs.  She is the one who waits patiently for him and never loves another.  She is steadfast and loyal, with an unconditional love that is at times admirable and at times pathetic.<br /><br />If a modern day Penelope and Odysseus is your cup of tea, you'll enjoy this one.	2004-08-17

The amusing tale of New York public relations man Norman Paperman centers on a universal dream---quitting the rat race, escaping to the sunny Caribbean to loll about in the sunshine amidst scantily-clad beauties, and be the King of one's own alcohol-induced domain.<br />Norman is swept into the realization of his mid-life crisis when exuberant Lester Atlas presents him with a fait accompli---money to become an island innkeeper, supervising one of the most charming money-makers on the fictional island of Amerigo.  Norman soon discovers being an innkeeper is fraught with peril, but his misadventures will leave you laughing and longing for a quick trip to sunny Paradise.<br />Many characters propel this book, each charmingly depicted as only a great storyteller like Wouk can.  From the reclusive Iris Tramm, to the all-forgiving Henny Paperman and her nubile daughter Hazel, to the outrageous Hippolyte, and most especially the native Kinjans who give this novel a charm most realistic yet alarming, the reader is swept into life on an island paradise that is at once heaven and hell.<br />Can Norman forget his successful New York career and make the transition to a change in latitude and attitude?  Will phrases like &quot;We be jammin', mon&quot; erase the bitter cold of a New York winter and the thousand indignities a pr man must suffer?  Will his penchant for extra-marital affairs be his undoing?  Will a long-ago girlfriend's dark secret shock him?  Put on the suntan oil and read while you bake for an experience everyone should have at least once.<br />By the way, the book is not complete until you also listen to the CD from the musical that Jimmy Buffett and Herman Wouk collaborated on.  It may not have been the toast of Broadway but it is the perfect accompaniment to a reading of this book.	2004-07-19

When it comes to cats, fat is where it's at and nobody does fat better than Garfield in a smorgasboord of full-color strips to make you laugh the day away.	2004-07-04

Although SONS OF FORTUNE may not be another KANE AND ABEL, I was thoroughly enchanted and caught up in this story of Nat Cartwright and Fletcher Davenport.<br />A meddling nurse decides to play God and let one woman who gives birth to twins think one of them has died.  She gives the other twin to her employer who has difficulty carrying a baby to full-term.  So begins the story of two young boys whose lives parallel each other in remarkable ways through triumphs and tragedies.  Nat grows up in his natural parents middle-class lifestyle while Fletcher becomes the heir to a wealthy family's largesse.  Their days at boarding school and college are told in such a way that only enhances Archer's reputation as a master storyteller, albeit not so perfect on all factual information.  Nat becomes a VietNam hero, Fletcher becomes a community savior.  Both have lucrative careers in New York, but are brought back to their hometown in Connecticut.  They are propelled into political careers that have them both running for Governor of the state.  Meanwhile, an old nemesis of both is murdered and one stands trial while the other defends him.  All the while, the reader is breathlessly waiting for the BIG NEWS to be revealed.  Will anyone notice the similarities as they stand side by side?  Will their innate connection tip anyone off to the true story?  Will their lives change dramatically if the truth is ever revealed?<br />Unfortunately, an otherwise great book falters terribly in the final section.  Senseless tragedy in each man's family only compounded this reader's frustration.  After being dumbstruck at the ending, I can only offer this to those of you who share my feelings at the ending:  go back and read the beginning of Chapter 31 and then reread the last paragraph when the mayor TURNS AROUND to face the two candidates.<br />Not perfect, but I still found it well worth reading and totally enjoyable if not a bit let-down by what could have been the most tear-jerking reunion ever, but wasn't.enjoyable if not a bit let-down by what could have been the most tear-jerking reunion ever, but wasn't.	2004-07-02

The suspense and mystery are first-rate as clues to a decades old murder are revealed.  An amnesiac searching for her past, two orphans looking for their future, a handsome stranger, a dedicated psychiatrist, and an elderly eccentric are some of the characters you will take to heart.  But it is homicide cop Franco Mahoney who is my personal favorite as he combines the best of Irish charm and affability with his innately Italian love of opera and gourmet cuisine.<br />Set in San Francisco, Paris, and Hawaii, this story follows the key characters as their lives overlap in a well-plotted, page-turning story.  Accident victim Bea French finds a true friend in psychiatrist Phyl Forster who has forgotten what a personal life is.  Naturally, Franco Mahoney hopes to give her one, until a handsome stranger with an erotic obsession whisks her off to his private island.  Can the good guy win the girl?  Will ancestors long dead be avenged?  Will Bea's memory return, and at what price?  Will a cat named Coco and a dog named Poochie save the day?  This is one you won't want to put down and one that leaves you wanting more from these characters and this writer.	2004-06-23

I mean *really* even.  That's the plot in Jeffrey Archer's first novel.  Four disparate men are each swindled out of their life's savings by a clever con man.  How they combine to get even and try to reclaim what is rightfully theirs makes for a brilliantly plotted, fact-paced read peopled by sympathetic characters.  Stephen, an Oxford professor, Robin, a Harley Street physician, Jean-Pierre Lamanns, a French art dealer, and James Brigsley, an English lord, all find themselves in identical circumstances.  Singularly, they are powerless, but united they develop a plan to win back their lost money without exacting any further punishment than attaining not a penny more, not a penny less, of that which was stolen from them.<br />Although this is quite different from Archer's later family sagas such as KANE AND ABEL, AS THE CROW FLIES, and others, it is no less ingenious or entertaining. This is a light-hearted romp filled with humor, romance, and revenge.  There's also a knock-your-socks off ending to end all endings.	2004-06-15

You will be intrigued by how his life is ruled by logic and order, but saddened by the lack of emotion and human contact he allows.<br />The story begins when he discovers the body of a neighbor's dog impaled on a garden fork.  He cradles Wellington and is mistaken for the killer by the dog's owner.  After a harrowing night in jail, his social worker suggests he write his experiences in a journal, which becomes this book.  At times heart-rending (discovering letters from his mother) and at times tedious (an especially detailed trip to London) this book does give readers an insight into the mind of an autistic person they have perhaps not had before.  Christopher is exceptionally gifted in math and some of the math puzzles will be a bit overwhelming yet interesting.<br />The mystery of the dog's death is solved long before the end of the book, allowing the last quarter of the novel to be rather flat and anti-climatic.  However, if you're looking for something with a different slant and completely out-of-the-ordinary, this may be enjoyable for you.	2004-06-07

Her story centers on her aunt, Lily Molyneux, a beautiful woman of 19th century Ireland who drove men to madness.  Because of a brutal rape, Lily becomes pregnant.  Afraid that her wealthy father will make her marry her attacker since he comes from a &quot;good&quot; family, she names the lowly stableboy on the estate as the father of her child seeing that as a way to stay single.  As with every decision in her life, Lily acts before she thinks and lives to regret her impulsive actions.  Not only is she thrown out of her home, but the stableboy and his brother must also flee for their lives.  Thus begins a multi-layered tale that takes the reader from the slums of Boston to the mansions of Beacon Hill and the magnificent skyscrapers of Wall Street.  Three men will spend their lives hoping to marry Lily, each amasssing fame and fortune while dreaming of the day Lily will be his wife.  A fourth man will marry her and a fifth will give his life for her sins.  Two children will call her mother and their lives will be tormented by her actions.<br />This is a riveting tale of the Irish elite in their homeland and the Irish peasants struggling in America.  It is a tale of passion, revenge, and a modern day murder that must lay bare the secrets of three generations before it can be solved.<br />Brilliantly plotted with memorable characters and unforgettable events, this is a must read for fans of family sagas.	2004-06-02

Six members of the class are being honored, and you would be hard-pressed to find another group of such obvious malcontents.  However, amongst the honorees is renowned historian Jean Sheridan who harbors the secret of having given up her out-of-wedlock child for adoption.  Now, not only Jean, but her child and everyone who shared her lunch table is systematically being eliminated by a disturbed fellow student who identifies himself as &quot;the Owl&quot; because nighttime is his time.<br />This is a look into the mind of a psychopathic serial killer and the lasting effects of childhood bullying.  Interestingly enough, all the men being honored were bullied as high schoolers, but all have become successful in their chosen fields.  However, those long-ago scars cause serious repercussions that erupt at the reunion.<br />My main complaint with this book is there are too many characters to keep track of.  The four men being honored are barely distinguishable one from the other and it is virtually anitclimatic when the killer is finally exposed.<br />On the other hand, the suspense you expect from Mary Higgins Clark is present as well as two sub-plots involving romance.<br />If you are already a fan of her work, this one will not disappoint.	2004-05-19

His amazing storytelling ability, completely enchanting characters, and surprising twists all combine to make a totally enjoyable novel.<br />Archer uses his rags-to-riches theme with Charlie Trumper, young barrow boy from the Whitechapel area of London's East End.  Charlie masters the fine craft of becoming the best fruit and vegetable man in all of the East End, a talent he hones at his grandfather's side and one that stays with him for life and gives him his greatest thrill.<br />The reader watches Charlie grow from eight-year-old urchin to World War I soldier and chairman of his own London department store.  Along the way both triumph and tragedy are his companions, but it is his bitter and hate-filled feud with the Trentham family that will leave you aghast and shocked, but always mesmerized and turning the pages.<br />For Jeffrey Archer has written here the ultimate page-turner, one you will be loathe to put down for such mundane tasks as going to work or sleeping.  And as always with Jeffrey Archer, you will never guess the ending.  He will surprise you and make this reading experience one you'll long savor.	2004-05-10

Thinking the end is near, she spills every secret she has ever had to the stranger next to her.  How she lost her virginity, what she really thinks of her boyfriend, the petty stunts she pulls on co-workers, the way she killed her parents' goldfish while they were on vacation and replaced it without their knowledge, her deepest thoughts on g-strings, cousins, Charles Dickens, and more.  When the plane miraculously lands, Emma is thankful she will never again see this man who knows every little secret of her life.<br />Emma returns to her job as a junior marketing executive and as she attempts to climb the corporate ladder, every embarrassing secret of her life is exposed.  How Emma combats this public humiliation and discovers another person's secret makes for a rollicking good read.<br />Emma is very reminiscent of Kinsella's other heroine, the shopaholic Becky Bloomwood.  Equally appealing are Emma's two flatmates---her life-long friend Lissy and the irrepressible Jemima who will have you laughing hystericaly at her thoughts on men, jewels, and all things fashionable.<br />This is a quick and fun read, sure to satisfy fans of the Shopaholic series or chick-lit in general.	2004-04-29

It's his reminiscences of what might have been and his deep lust over a co-worker that fuel this witty novel about a 30-something guy looking for Ms. Right in New York City.<br />With Bob Dylan lyrics playing the soundtrack of his life, Tom spouts forth funny one-liners on every page.  On his secret for cooking to impress girls---\\"For me, every recipe begins the same way:  disable all alarms.\\" On guy friends---\\"Chance may have brought us together, but alcohol made us friends.\\"  On depression:  \\"When I find myself in times of trouble, Bloody Mary comes to me.\\"<br />Tom is a guy who tells us he wants Tom Cruise's smile, Bob Dylan's poetry, and Elvis's swagger.  Unfortunately, he winds up with Tom Cruise's height, Bob Dylan's hair, and Elvis's liver.<br />If you're looking to find the answer to what makes a man tick, you may not find it here.  Unless they really are as shallow (...)as Tom is.  Nevertheless, this is a pleasant diversion from the chick lit books that delve into every neurotic impulse women have.  It proves, if nothing else, that men have their own set of problems, as well.	2004-04-22

Although it falls a shade short of the greatness of its predecessor, this is still an outstanding novel that reveals more about the characters I had come to love in the first book.<br />Some may argue that Jeffrey Archer cheats the reader since approximately the first 200 pages are a recap of KANE AND ABEL.  However, instead of getting the story from the viewpoint of the two men, we see the events throught the eyes of Abel's daughter Florentyna and the added insight makes the second telling of the events highly worthwhile.<br />Florentyna Rosnovski is a formidable and unforgettable character.  She endears herself to readers as a young girl through her relationship with her governess Miss Tredgold and her adventures from elementary school through college.  Even the expected meeting with Richard Kane takes on new dimensions as they marry despite the deep rejection by both fathers.<br />It was after the initial marriage and career boom that I thought the book faltered slightly.  Florentyna became too perfect, everything came too easily, and even the tragic events did not seem to touch her as I would have expected.  However, her rise to fame and her battle to achieve her childhood ambition by becoming President of the United States is a page-turning read, one that will surely satisfy fans of KANE AND ABEL.	2004-04-13

I think Fannie Flagg is always witty and heartwarming, but this, her first novel, has to be the most humorous book ever.<br />Daisy Fay Harper's story is told via her diary which begins in 1952 when she is eleven-years-old and ends in 1959 when she leaves Mississippi to begin her long-awaited future.  Along the way, the reader is treated to a hodgepodge of beautifully-drawn characters including would-be socialites, restaurant operators, wayward preachers, theater people, back-alley abortionists, and more.<br />Whether it's rising from the dead, riding half-naked on horseback through the middle of town, or competing for a longed-for scholarship in the Miss Mississippi pageant, Daisy Fay is about the most endearing character to ever leap from the pages of a novel.  She is stubborn, feisty, loving, loyal, and focused.  Most of all, her coming of age is an accurate portrayal of Southern life in the 1950's.  It has not been sanitized to be politically correct or rewritten to avoid offense.  It is truthful and sincere and the most side-splittingly funny novel I've had the pleasure of reading.<br />Whether you grew up in the South or not, this microcosm of small-town life in the 1950's will touch your heart.  So join Daisy Fay, her struggling mother and her father, the Miracle Man, for a trip back to a time and era that is too rich with human emotion to ever forget.	2004-03-26

It has drama, suspense, romance, and enough plot twists to keep the most savvy reader breathlessly reading until the heart-wrenching conclusion.<br />William Kane and Abel Rosnovski both enter the world in 1906.  One is born to a wealthy, socially prominent Boston family.  The other is born in poverty in Poland to an unwed woman who dies during childbirth.  They each have a remarkable life story that makes for spellbinding reading until the finale in 1963.<br />Abel is rescued from the woods beside the body of his dead mother by a hunter and taken into a peasant family.  The Russian occupation of Poland, his fearful and solitary escape to Turkey and later America, will have you cheering this tough young boy.<br />Meanwhile, young William Kane is growing up in the lap of luxury, attending the finest schools, and winning every honor his father before him achieved.<br />You will be fascinated by Archer's storytelling and the vivid characters he portrays.  You will root for Abel and take him to your heart.  You will be fascinated with William and wish only the best for him.  Unfortunately, when the two characters cross paths as young men, a fierce hatred erupts and they become life-long enemies, as Abel swears to destroy William Kane.<br />The author has made each of his main characters so endearing that the reader is torn and loyalties falter.  Do you root for Abel?  Do you root for William?  Dare you hope they will work this out? Whatever you are thinking, you will be surprised.  This is not one of those novels where you will see the ending coming, but you will be stunned, sad, and uplifted as a gamut of emotions play with your mind and heart.<br />I finished this late last night and have been thinking about Abel and William all day.

All the characters we've come to love also return.  There's the esteemed Mrs. Bloxby, the flamboyant Ron Silver, endearing Bill Wong minus his wacky parents, and even a surprise visit from Sir Charles Fraith.  Agatha, however, does seem to be getting a little too trite.  I love her crotchety nature, and although there were glimpses of it here, Agatha is becoming a little too obsessed with whatever man moves in next door. Worst of all, the strong Mrs. Raisin actually broke down and cried and, horror of horrors, fainted at the sight of a dead body.  That's not the real Agatha!  Don't go soft on us, girl!<br />This book also didn't live up to previous ones because Agatha's male love interest was just too wimpy for words.  The fact that he had a wife, albeit a stereotypical dark-haired and jealous beauty, also never really made the reader think Agatha could wind up with him.  So now, yet another man may move into the cottage next door and Agatha will have one more chance to wear her sexy black nightie.  Ho, hum.  Maybe Ms. Beaton needs to go back to what made Agatha so endearing to begin with---her desperate plotting, her vulnerablity, her total disdain for anything that stood in her path and her hilariously outrageous behavior.<br />I was also a little disappointed that the big plans Agatha made at the end of the previous book---the desire to start an active group for senior citizens of the village---got nary a mention.  Hopefully, her big plan at the end of this book will carry forward to the next one.<br />With all the shortcomings of this offering, I still love Agatha, a woman who wouldn't dream of cooking for herself and will subsist on frozen dinners while preparing fresh fish for her cats.	2004-02-21

That's the year that an accident killed both her parents and left her and her one-year-old sister Bo and two older brothers, Matt and Luke, an orphaned family.  Rather than allow the children to be split up among relatives, nineteen-year-old Luke makes the decision that he will forego college and care for his siblings.  Life is hard but always interesting as the four survive by their wits and help from family and friends.<br />Mainly, this is the story of Kate and her love for her brother Matt.  Matt has always been her role model, her idol and inspiration.  It is he who first plants the idea of studying zoology in her head with his always entertaining trips to the nearby ponds on their land.  Matt is the over-achieving academic of the family who hatches a secret plot with Kate.  He will get his college degree and with the wonderful job he will land he can pay for her to attend college.  When she graduates, the two of them will help send Bo and Luke.<br />Alas, the plan goes awry when a terrible tragedy at a neighbor's house spills over to the Morrisons and changes the course of all their lives.  How Kate deals with this tragedy and its far-reaching effects on her will certainly give the reader a lot to consider about families and the place each child has in his or hers.  This is a story of great love and great loss and the healing that takes many years to accomplish.  It is a tale of resentment and jealousy played against the power of loyalty.  It is an uplifting tale of succeeding against terrible odds and almost losing what is most important.	2004-02-10

How refreshing to have a writer who only improves on her own perfection.<br />She has taken the edgy, imperfect, exasperating moments of marriage and woven a tapestry of life and its changes in the course of a fifty-year relationship. Michael and Pauline first meet in the fervor of patriotism that swept their neighborhoods in the days immediately after Pearl Harbor. They loved, they fought, they made each other miserable, and they married. They continued to fight and make each other miserable and the love was not so easy to see. They had three children and were conflicted by their raising of them. The whole family seems to change when the oldest daughter runs away from home. The pain of that act leaves its indelible mark on all of them and things are never as good as before, though they weren't all that good before.<br />Anne Tyler has taken an ordinary couple and placed them in a commonplace situation like she always does. Yet she manages to make each page riveting, a can't-put-down read that involves the reader so deeply in the lives of Pauline, Michael and their family that one is reluctant to say goodbye. Surely, this outwardly ideal looking family can be &quot;fixed.&quot; Surely the fighting will stop, Lindy will return home, and they will all live happily ever after. Surely. But, alas.....<br />There are ordinary moments and there are extraordinary moments in this novel, but all become riveting in the hands of the masterful Anne Tyler. Will Pauline ever achieve her ideal of marriage as an interweaving of two souls? Will Michael be happy if he can attain his view of marriage, which is two people traveling side by side but separately?  Can two people who don't like each other very much overcome that when the love just won't die?  Can two good Catholics raise a grandchild named Pagan?<br />From its compelling opening to its tearful ending, this is Anne Tyler writing as good or better than she has ever written. If you're already a fan, you'll adore it. If you're new to this author, it's the perfect starting point.n she has ever written. If you're already a fan, you'll adore it.

She's hip.  She's Irish.  And she has written some of the most entertaining and humorous novels I've had the pleasure of reading.  So it is quite a treat for me to sit down and enjoy what our Irish cousins have already been treated to....a collection of many of her columns which have appeared in the Irish Times newspaper.  This may be old hat to Dubliners, but it's a newfound treasure for most Americans.<br />The book is like a box of chocolates and each short read is a tasty little morsel to devour and enjoy.  What a treat it is to get this inside look at one of my favorite authors and share in her musings on just about everything.  How does it feel to see someone actually purchase your book?  How did she get the background material for Sushi?  What was the nicest time of her life?  How did it feel to be at a book signing for Rachel's Holiday and have no one show up? What are her feelings on shoes, Catholicism, real estate agents, and a whole lot more.<br />My personal favorite was &quot;Happy Christmas!  Form An Orderly Queue&quot; not only because I love to read any work set at Christmastime but because of the glimpse it gives us into Marian's family life which just had to have been the basis for the wild and whacky Walsh clan of many of her novels.<br />If you love Marian Keyes already or if you just like short humorous pieces to make you laugh out loud, I highly recommend this one.	2004-01-20

He takes a human or societal flaw and dissects it page by page and the reader cannot but help thinking how real and how commonplace Steinbeck's characters and situations are.  In \\"Winter\\" the author centers on the greed and lust for material riches that was prevalent in America of the late1950s and early 1960s.  Ethan Hawley, the protagonist, is a Harvard-educated man of once-prominent social standing who through the misfortunes of his whaling captain father is currently the clerk in a grocery store his father once owned.  The present owner, an Italian immigrant, is the target of hostility for the simple reason that he is foreign.<br />Ethan Hawley is a man pushed by the desires of his wife Mary and his two children, Ellen and Allen.  This middle-class family yearns for a more upscale life than Ethan can provide.  A television, new curtains and furniture are some of the material possessions they long for.  Because Ethan cannot provide them he makes a decision that incorporates the worst elements of greed and avarice.  He embarks on a well thought-out plot to illegally obtain the money necessary to give his family the luxuries they desire.  And so in lies the crux of this story...what happens to a man that forsakes his morals for the happiness of his family?<br />There are many supporting characters that flavor the book.  Most notably Ethan's childhood friend Danny, now the town drunk, and his wife's best friend Margie who apparently is the town's most popular call girl.  There is also the banker, a teller, and Mr. Marullo, the immigrant grocery store owner, whose tragedy becomes Ethan's triumph.<br />When accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature for this novel, Steinbeck stated that a writer is charged with exposing our many grievous faults and failures, with dredging up to the light our dark and dangerous dreams for the purpose of improvement.  Readers will certainly see a generation's most obvious faults and failures and have Ethan Hawley's dark and dangerous dreams exposed.  Interestingly enough, the materialistic greed exposed in this novel is still very real nearly fifty years later.ers will certainly see a generation's most obvious faults and failures and have Ethan Hawley's dark and dangerous dreams exposed.

If, as Anne Rivers Siddons insinuates in the opening lines of this novel, the South killed Lucy Bondurant, then no one need ever take responsibility for their bizarre actions and dysfunctional behavior.  Just blame it on your hometown.  Hogwash, Ms. Siddons!  You have given us much better than this cop-out.<br />Lucy and her mother, brother, and sister are seemingly abandoned by Lucy's father and this fact haunts her for her entire life as she searches for a father figure everywhere.  When her family takes up residence with wealthy relatives, she forms a bond of love and hate with her cousin Shep.  The fact that she ruins his life while destroying every chance at happiness he ever has, the fact that she is amoral, self-centered, and totally without real love for anyone cannot be blamed so easily on the fact that Atlanta emerged from a sleepy Southern hamlet to become one of the country's  greatest metropolitan areas.  There were too many other abandoned children (and worse) who turned into fine, upstanding adults in spite of early misfortunes.<br />In addition to Lucy being totally unlikeable as a heroine, it was the narrator Shep who made me sick with his pushover personality.  He enables Lucy every page of the novel and, amazingly, never sees her for the troublesome, demented woman she becomes.  Poor Shep the doormat.<br />Despite two highly unlikeable characters taking center stage in this novel, the story might be interesting since it is set in a pivotal time-frame of American history and one which today's aging baby boomers are very familiar with---Camelot, the assassination of JFK, the Civil Rights movement, Martin Luther King's dream, etc.  However, it slogs painfully along for about 400 pages before things really begin to happen.  Where were the editors on this one?<br />As I moved into the final 200 of 800+ pages, I began to think that maybe this was a pretty good book after all.  That's before the author knocked the wind out of me by ending with such ambiguity that I'm not sure what really happened.  So now I am desperately searching for friends, enemies, anyone who read this book and begging them to enlighten me as to what *really* happened in the last two paragraphs.iguity that I'm not sure what really happened.

I read this book because it was the monthly selection of my book club.  The glowing reviews on amazon captured my imagination and did not prepare me for the disappointment ahead.  I think the book might be truly appealing...if you are younger than sixteen.  For a middle-aged mother of college students, the love-starved 17-year old Cassandra Mortmain, a heroine totally at the mercy of her heart, left me untouched.<br />The author did a wonderful job of capturing teen-age angst over unrequited love, but none of the characters were what I would call appealing, or even mildly sympathetic.  Cassandra Mortmain, the heroine whose journal we as readers are privvy to, lives in an ancient castle with her father, step-mother, brother, and sister.  The family is now dirt poor thanks to a writer father who was a one-hit wonder and does nothing now but hole up in his private gatehouse.  The sister is busy batting her eyelashes as she really wants to marry a wealthy man who will save her from her life of poverty and the brother is never completely developed, though we do get inklings near the end that he may be the most normal of the family.  Only the stepmother has any desire to help herself.  While the rest of the family consider themselves too good to do an honest day's work, the stepmother travels to London and earns money as an artist's model.  The others had rather sit home and munch on old bread crusts while bemoaning their plight.  It was really hard for me to empathize with such a group.<br />The book is very reminiscent of Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" though it is set later, in 1940's England.  It is very much a coming of age story of a young girl who, through the course of the novel, finds love, loses love, rejects love, and yet \\"captures\\" all the feelings and characters around her as she spends hour after hour writing in her journal as an exercise in teaching herself how to write.<br />In the opening pages, Cassandra tells the reader that she will capture all the conversations, feelings, and characters in her life.  That she does, but for this reader, it was a disappointing story that failed to interest me.the conversations, feelings, and characters in her life.

From Poppy's tragic youth spent with a n'er-do-well gambling addict who allowed her to be raised by ladies of the evening and orphanages, to her rise as a notorious woman of France, I was totally engrossed in finding out what would happen next.  A life punctuated by lost love and the great sadness of giving birth to two children she could never fully know, make this one of the best novels I've read this year.<br />When investigative journalist Mike Preston is commissioned to find the missing heir/heiress to Poppy Mallory's fortune, he uncovers an incredibly tangled family tree and uproots all its darkest secrets.  From California to Venice to Paris and around the globe, this fascinating story unfolds with a richly-textured plot and distinctive characters.<br />From the very beginning, when Poppy's father Jeb Mallory concocts a plan with immigrant Nikolas Konstant, the story leads readers on a magical mystery of scandals, lies, and deception.  Who will emerge as the true heir becomes almost second in importance to the interesting lives Poppy, her friends, and descendents live.  Her childhood friends Angel and Greg Konstant, her first love Felipe and her unforgettable lover Franco as well as all the offspring of these characters are woven into a  remarkable tale that you won't want to put down.

Although I felt it didn't quite measure up to her two previous novels, this one does have as lovable a cast of eccentric characters as you could hope to meet.  Anna Lutz Abbott has lifelong soulmates in Jim and Frannie.  As our spunky heroine says, they are \\"unlikely souls struggling together, separately.\\"<br />Anna is a low country loving gal who gets knocked in the head with reality when her mama dies a scandalous death in bed with the wrong man.

But it is the cast of supporting characters that make this book come alive.  Jim, the gay friend who gives her child his name, her slightly slutty neighbor Lucy, the two loveable ole biddies next door, her beautiful daughter Emily who has morphed into a Goth home from college, and others make this one to laugh and cry over.<br />A most welcome surprise is that loyal DBF readers get a second chance to visit favorite characters from previous novels.  Susan from \\"Sullivan's Island\\" and Caroline from \\"Plantation\\" make cameo appearances.<br />Anna learns to love her life and realizes that she may never be Gandhi, but her life has significance and beauty and is a reflection of those she loves and cherishes.

Evil	John Steinbeck is at his best in this classic tale of sibling rivalry as he examines what we become vs. what we *may* become.  The Biblical tale of Cain and Abel sets the tone as we are introduced to two sets of brothers.  Each tries to win the love of his father in different ways.  The story of why one brother succeeds while another feels unloved is beautifully told.<br />Adam Trask, from the first set of brothers, repeats his own story with his sons, the twins Aron and Caleb.  The enduring themes of light vs. dark, good vs. evil, hatred vs. love, and always the free will, the ability to choose one's own destiny are paramount to this rich and multi-layered tale.<br />Above all, it is the characters you will long remember from this riveting saga.  Cathy, the whore with a heart of stone, has to be one of the most evil characters in all literature.  She kills her parents, beds her husband's brother on her wedding night, shoots her husband and desserts her infant sons.  And, all this before she turns really bad!  Truly a character to be analyzed for decades to come.  On the other hand there are the wonderful characters of Samuel and Lee, men you will long remember for their wisdom, caring, and sheer goodness.  And there is Adam, a zombie of a man until his great re-birth and spectacular failure finds him caught in a web of good and evil that he will long struggle with.<br />John Steinbeck puts himself into the novel, as Samuel Hamilton is based on his own maternal grandfather.  The entire Hamilton clan is one that represents the true \\"salt of the earth\\" and elevates this to \\"great American novel\\" stature.<br />The story is complex and involving, the characters unforgettable.

Her contemporary stories feature likeable women facing problems we can easily relate to, and the characters grow with a lot of self-motivation and help from dear friends.

Hope lacks the courage of her convictions and meekly adjusts her life to whatever Matt decides, even when it comes to uprooting her family, quitting her job, and moving to a strange town where she knows no one so that Matt can &quot;find himself&quot; and become the author he has always dreamed of being.<br />Her single sister Sam is a career-driven executive at a major record company in London.

The writing was fast-paced, intriguing, and had me breathlessly turning the pages hoping to discover what our hero and heroine were trying to discover---the Holy Grail.  Beginning with a grisly murder at the Louvre Museum, the reader is tantalized by clues hidden in poems, numbers, and various designs.  Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu are never fully developed as characters, but it's all right because in this book, the chase is everything.  The chase to find the Holy Grail and discover its secret is paramount.<br />My only complaint with the book is that it fictionalizes real people and real events and rewrites history in such a way to attempt to undermine Christianity.  While most readers are smart enough to distinguish between fact and fiction, this does plant a lot of innuendo, legend, and rumor masquerading as fact.  My advice is to take it for what it's worth...an exceptionally good thriller...and not to take too seriously its rewriting of historical and Biblical fact. On the upside, this book had me searching websites for factual information moreso than any book I've ever read.  I have also learned more about the works of Leonardo Da Vinci than I ever knew before and finally think I know why the Mona Lisa is smiling.	2003-07-07

After more than twenty novels following the same basic pattern, the plots have become a little too familiar, the ending a bit too predictable.<br />With that being said, I still enjoyed this one.  The deception and suspense were first-rate as always and the idea of corporate fraud very timely.  The charismatic Nicholas Spencer who is determined to develop his vaccine that cures cancer is larger-than-life.  Readers are drawn to him as we learn about his first wife's ill-fated battle with cancer and his concern for his own son and the millions of children he wants to save from the heartbreak of losing a parent to cancer.<br />Investigative reporter Carley DeCarlo is the heroine who has not only a professional interest in the disappearance of Nicholas Spencer but also a personal one.  She is the stepsister of his second wife and wants to either clear his name of the fraud he is accused of or be satisfied that he did indeed loot the company and offer false hope to patients.<br />Carley is led on a hot trail of clues as she tries to establish Spencer's guilt or innocence while a disturbed killer who lost money on the vaccine methodically kills every person he feels has committed an injustice against him.<br />Watching the threads come together and uncovering the a world of medical fraud and financial manipulation is interesting, but it is the cancer patients themselves who make this book tug at your heartstrings.  A young girl and a grown man find new life thanks to Spencer's vaccine, but others will fall hard as the truth comes to light.<br />Meanwhile, Carley's own tragic past is revealed and a new love gives her support and hope as she discovers love the second time around.	2003-06-27

Years later, when a therapist asks her how she was able to hold things together for so long, she will reply \\"That's easy.  I belong to a book club.\\"  For it is on that cold and snowy night that Faith and four of her neighbors conceive of a book club that will bind them for life and see them through their darkest traumas and most joyful events.  Readers will be totally engrossed in the lives of these stay-at-home moms:  Faith, who hides a past that shames her; Audrey, the proverbial sex kitten who can't hold her husband; Merit, the shy introvert who suffers physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her doctor husband; Slip, the antiwar activist who finds plenty to shout about during the Vietnam era; and Kari, the widowed elder of the group whose life takes on new meaning when an unexpected event gives her the child she has always longed for.  From the sixties to the nineties you will follow these women and share their deep friendship, big laughs, and heart-breaking tears.  The big bonus for book-lovers is that each chapter features the book title and author being discussed at the monthly meeting.  Your interest will be piqued as you rediscover old favorites and may be inspired to read a few you missed along the way.<br />Lorna Landvik has created unforgettable characters, strong women who discover amazing things about themselves as they adapt to changing times and changing lives.  I heartily recommend this most enjoyable book and only wish my own neighborhood had a chapter of Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons.	2003-05-16

There are several reasons this book is so outstanding.  One, the mystery takes center stage as Agatha unravels clues that would make another more famous Agatha proud.  Second, even though Agatha maintains her unlovable ways that endear her to readers, she begins to develop the first seeds of altruistic kindness.  Her innate goodness in befriending a chess-playing senior citizen and starting a project for the village's elderly give Agatha a softer side to balance her abrasive side.  Third, James Lacey barely gets a mention.  The egotistical former husband is mentioned merely in passing and Agatha appears well on her way to a James-less life and better for it.<br />Naturally, there is a love interest.  Agatha is quite taken with the beautiful new curate, Tristan Delon.  Flattered when he invites her to dinner, Agatha daydreams of romance before getting a first-hand taste of his malicious ways.  When the curate is found murdered, rumors fly.  The chief rumor appears to be that the murderer is none other than Vicar Bloxby who had good cause to be jealous of the young curate's popularity.  Agatha's best friend, Mrs. Bloxby, implores Agatha to clear the Vicar's good name by finding the real murderer.  Agatha teams up with next door neighbor John Armitage and together they track down numerous leads.  Although Armitage's character fails to develop as anything substantial, the mystery itself is riveting and takes a few twists before the surprise ending.  This reader has no regrets about Armitage's decision to move back to London, but hopes the new neighbor, a Mr. Paul Chatterton, will finally be someone who is worthy of the irrepressible Agatha Raisin.	2003-05-16

This is due mainly to Patricia Scanlan's ability to create three distinctive women, each with serious contemporary problems and each with the inner strength and tenacity to face whatever comes, especially when she has true friends to stand by her.<br /><br />The resourceful Devlin, the insecure Caroline, and the fun-loving Maggie are young Dublin women who confront out-of-wedlock pregnancy, a husband who strays, men who are not what they appear to be, alcohol addiction, and even the death of a beloved child.  You will be totally engrossed in their lives and the people that move through it----from the compassionate Luke to the sophisticated Richard and the fun-loving Terry as well as the secondary characters who add intrigue, romance, and a lot of Irish charm.<br />If you're looking for a book you won't be able to put down, one that involves you so deeply in the lives of the characters you feel as if you know them, and one rich with the flavor of London and Dublin, I highly recommend this one.  As a matter of fact, I had scarcely finished it when I picked up the sequel CITY WOMAN because even after nearly 500 pages, I wasn't ready to say goodbye to these wonderful characters.	2003-03-27

Not only does she have her dream job (personal shopper at Barney's) and live in a shopper's paradise (Manhattan) but she has just become engaged to long-time boyfriend Luke via a highly romantic and original proposal.  Nothing could go wrong for Becky now, or could it?  If Becky's mother is planning a traditional family wedding in England while Luke's mother is planning the most extravagant wedding imagineable at the fashionable Plaza in New York and both weddings are scheduled for the same day, you mighy say Becky has a problem.  The girl who could never say no to a Vera Wang dress, a Prada sample sale, or new shoes from Christian Louboutin apparently can't say no to either wedding.  But even Becky can't be two places at one time, or can she?<br />Becky still has an eye for a fine piece of apparel, but it is Luke who has tremendous character growth in this installment, as he becomes less of an accessory for Becky and a multi-layered man in his own right.  Old friends like Suze, Tarquin, and Tom from next door are also there as Becky's wedding day approaches with all the laughter, angst, and turmoil we've come to expect from Sophie Kinsella's brilliant series.	2003-03-12

If you long for the charm of the Italian countryside and revel in quaint shops and romantic cafes with a foreign flavor, pick up a copy of &quot;Summer in Tuscany.&quot;  Travel with harried New York physician Gemma Jericho, her Italian-born mother Nonna, and her punk but mannerly daughter to the romantic Bella Piacere when they discover Nonna has inherited an Italian villa.  When things seem too good to be true they most often are, and the ownership of the villa seems to be in grave dispute.  A hunky Long Island artist appears to have purchased it legally and as the mostly predictable plot unfolds you'll feel Gemma's pain as she loses her heart and soul to the artist while mainly behaving as a lovesick teenager.  There is so much local color you'll be reaching for juicy olives and sun-dried tomatoes, deciding to have a grappa with your dinner, and maybe even scouring the stores for the latest Italian import.  There's also enough steamy romance to satisfy the passionate soul, but it is Gemma's secret past that really warms the reader to this slightly ditzy American in Florence. It may not be great literature, but it is an entertaining read with charm, romance, and a multi-generational bonding experience to savor.	2003-02-27

In lieu of that, I'm recommending it to everyone I know as the \\"must read\\" book of the year.  Not only does this have as romantic a love story as you could ever want, but it also features an epic sweep of Victorian London and late 19th century New York, a diabolical killer, and an all-consuming plot for revenge.  At the center of all of this is Fiona Finnegan, an endearing heroine who lifts herself from the slums of London to become the queen of tea merchants residing in an upscale 5th Avenue mansion.<br />The story telling is so intimate and compelling that I did not want to ever put this one down.  Fiona captures your heart when you first meet her clutching twelve pounds, two shillings, and a dream in a battered cocoa tin.  When she finds her perfect love affair shattered by another woman's wanton seduction and a vicious murder decimates her family, Fiona's staunch character is tested to its limits.  A barrage of even more tragic events leads her to a heart-stopping escape to New York and more problems to overcome.  In addition to Fiona, the secondary characters are so well drawn that you feel connected to them immediately.  Her loving father Paddy, her mam, brothers Charlie and Seamie as well as Uncle Michael, her dear friend Nicholas, and many others will capture your imagination.  But it is Fiona's love for the unforgettable Joe Bristow and her steadfast goal of destroying her father's killer that will keep you glued to the pages and relishing every delicious moment of this story.	2003-02-11

If you find yourself at the height of your career in fast-paced Chicago, should you return to the laid-back life of the South Carolina low country?  If your name is Cara Rutledge, the answer to both questions is yes.  When Cara finds herself ousted from her ad agency position, her ongoing love affair not fulfilling, and nowhere else to turn, she reluctantly answers her mother's call to come for a visit.<br />The reader will be drawn immediately into this story mainly because of well-defined characters who tug at your heartstrings.  From the headstrong yet vulnerable Cara to her terminally ill mother Lovie and the pregnant teenager Toy, readers will bond with these multi-faceted characters as they  try to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives and each moves on with the support of the others.<br />This book is a great tribute to the eternal bond between mothers and daughters as it examines the actions that part us from our loved ones and the painful road back to rediscovering love.  It is also a great love story as Cara finds her soulmate in the most unexpected place, her mother reveals a long-held secret love affair,and Toy faces some serious truths about the father of her unborn child.  It is also a story about turtles.  Yes, turtles.  Specifically, the loggerhead turtles who travel hundreds of miles to hatch their young along the South Carolina coast each year.  Even if you've never given the first thought to turtles, you will be captivated by the turtle trivia that fills this book.<br />I highly recommend you curl up in your favorite reading spot for a most enjoyable read about an unforgettable family.  And don't forget the tissues.	2003-02-04

They converge at a diner in the middle of nowhere and board a rickety bus to San Juan de la Cruz.  Each has his or her own good points and bad points, secret shame and hopeful dream.  Steinbeck bring each to life and has you empathize with them, hate them, love them, and most likely long remember them.  Why?  Because these people are universal.  Their problems, hopes, and realities are just as prevalent in 2003 as they were when Steinbeck penned this one. From the sexually-charged Juan Chicoy to the acne-scarred Kit, from the promiscuous Camille to the dysfunctional Pritchard family, from the mean-spirited Van Brunt to the insecure waitress Norma and the soldier-turned-salesman Horton, these passengers will lead you on a most introspective trip into a world where everything and nothing changes.<br />I found it interesting that in his 1962 Nobel Prize acceptance speech Steinbeck said, \\"The ancient commission of the writer has not changed. He is charged with exposing our many grievous faults and failures, with dredging up to the light our dark and dangerous dreams for the purpose of improvement.\\"  Certainly, he lived up to this commission completely with \\"The Wayward Bus.\\"	2003-01-16

Author David Baldacci shows us quite clearly that it's not the destination that matters, but how you enjoy the journey.<br />Tom Langdon sets off on a cross-country train trip at Washington, D.C. and plans to arrive in L.A. for Christmas.  Having reached middle age, it is time to do some soul-searching and rethinking of life goals, and what better place than the peaceful journey a train can provide.  As one of the characters so succintly tells our hero, &quot;....most folk who ride trains could care less where they're going.  For them it's the journey itself and the people they meet along the way...they're looking for some friendship, a warm body to talk to.  People don't rush on a train, because that's not what trains are for.&quot;<br />What Tom does encounter is a less than peaceful situation plus a mix of interesting characters. A Christmas Eve avalanche, an on-board wedding, people who are not who they say they are, a ghost from the past, and a lot of Amtrak trivia will keep you interested as you travel cross-country on Tom's trip of self-examination.  Some may call the ending predictable, but a very clever twist took me completely by surprise and made the journey even more interesting in retrospect.<br />This isn't great literature but it is an entertaining holiday read that makes this reader want to call Amtrak immediately to board the next train out of town.  Great fun that I'm glad I found under my Christmas tree this year!	2003-01-04

Surprisingly, I won it while playing 'Dirty Santa' at a neighborhood party and felt compelled to read it.  What a treat!  This is one of the most heartwarming stories and probably the best by the wonderful Richard Paul Evans.  Readers will be enchanted by the story of the young father who with his wife and daughter take up residence with an elderly lady in order to make ends meet.  Instead of mere companions and housekeepers to the woman, they become dear and trusted friends.  They, like the reader, are mystified by her past and want to know more about the Christmas box in the attic and the secret of the letters it holds.<br />This book answers the profound question, 'What is the first gift of Christmas.'  As every parent knows, it is a parent's love for a child and without being overly sappy on the religion angle, this book beautifully illustrates God's love for His children in sending His Son.<br />Speaking directly to parents who have lost children, this book will appeal to everyone who believes in Christmas and the importance of cherishing family.  For an uplifting renewal of your committment to yourself and to your family, read this book.	2003-01-01

The premise of the story sounded intriguing---two 'ordinary' couples meet and form a friendship that lasts a lifetime.  Alas, real life is often dull and this book redefines dull.  The promise of youth and the sadness of aging no matter how gracefully, the love that endures sickness and health, the value of true friendship are all examined and with introspective honesty.  However, what isn't in the book, the great moments glossed over or ignored, left this reader wondering how Wallace Stegner got to be so renowned.<br />On a more positive note, if you can endure the first 3/4 of the book, the last 1/4 will be uplifting.  The reader will finally get some insight into Charity and Syd's dysfunctional marriage, Larry's unquestioning love for the invalid Sally, and the universality of Stegner's premise that one of us doesn't differ that much from another, each generation repeating its parents so that everything returns upon itself, repeating and renewing until the present can hardly be told from past.<br />Stegner writes a convincing enough narrative about the grace of surviving life, but as for me, the next time I want a story about nothing, I will tune in to a Seinfeld rerun.	2003-01-01

This story of two people whose lives intersect briefly one Christmas Eve shows how a small, insignificant event can alter your life forever.  Robert Layton is a high-powered bankruptcy attorney whose hard work and long hours at the office have given his family all the material things of life but very little family unity.  Nathan is an eight-year-old boy whose mother is dying of ovarian cancer.  One Christmas Eve, after his father has told him that his mother will soon be going to heaven, Nathan frantically searches the stores for something to make his mother feel beautiful when she meets Jesus.  He finds a pair of glittery silver shoes with red, blue, and green rhinestones and shimmering sequins.  When he attempts to pay for them but doesn't have enough money he turns to the man behind him in line and asks for help.  That man, Robert, has his life changed forever in this poignant moment.<br />The book details the family life of these two characters that brings them to the pivotal moment in the store and takes the reader into the future when Nathan is a grown man who once again has a chance encounter with Robert.<br />This is a story of how one man attempts to regain the family he has neglected while another family comes to terms with losing their wife and mother.  It is a story to remind us all to be appreciative of the life we have, the small joys, and shared memories.  It is a story of hope and faith and, most of all, the love that transcends the deepest heartaches.	2002-12-15

She's back and as good as ever with heartwarming stories about ordinary people whose lives are changed while dining at Quentins.  The popular Dublin restaurant from her previous novels is at the heart of this story.  Its owner, managers, employees, and customers all have a story to tell: Martin, the father with a short fuse, who dines with his son Jody; Maggie, the good student whose parents give her a serious celebration at the restaurant; Drew the visitor whose change of heart changes his life; Mon the waitress who unwittingly unmasks the banker's book in the plain brown wrapper; Yvonne whose mother's little white lie creates a new life for Frank and his three daughters; Laura who finds a way to spend Mother's Day without her children.  And best of all, there is Quentin himself, whose encounter with a shabby and eccentric old man sets the whole story in motion.<br />The fabulous bonus of this book is we find out what happened to some favorite characters from previous books.  Ria Lynch's life was left on hold when TARA ROAD ended, but now we know what happened.  Ditto for Tom and Cathy and Simon and Maud from SCARLET FEATHER and the Signora and Aidan from EVENING CLASS.<br />The story of the restaurant and its people are all brought into focus by Ella Brady who is in charge of developing a documentary about modern day Dublin.  Her love affair with an unscrupulous married man has left her life in shambles and nearly destroyed her family and friends.  But Ella has a special place in her heart for Quentins and its managers--- the unflappable Brenda Brennan, her chef/husband Patrick, and his uniquely appealing brother Blouse.  When she chooses to tell Dublin's story through the people who walk through the door of Quentins she gets more than she bargained for.<br />So pour yourself a cup of tea and book the best seat in the house for a relaxing time at Quentins.	2002-11-10

I can't overlook the fact that the plot is a virtual copy of THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, that the ending is evident within the first few pages, or that the characters fail to ignite any sympathy but remain cardboard cut-outs from first page to last.<br />I give him credit for attempting to write a passionate middle-aged love story, but must he rely on such hackneyed stereotypes as the lonely, desserted wife and the workaholic man who never stopped to smell the roses?  And while it is true that people can change at any age, the transformation of Paul Flanner just doesn't ring true.<br />Sparks has not forgotten how to write a tear-jerker, however, and this one will leave you at least misty or most likely crying a bucketful of tears.  But this is Nicholas Sparks, so you didn't really expect \\"happily ever after,\\" did you?<br />However, the most insulting thing about this book to me was the premise that two nights of good talk and good sex can change your life forever and make you wiser, happier, and more together than you could possibly imagine no matter what else happens to you.  Whatever happened to building a relationship on trust, friendship, respect, and passion?<br />Readers have gotten much better from Nicholas Sparks in the past and will, hopefully, do so in the future.	2002-10-09

Maggie Walsh Garvin is the only sane member of the family, or so we have been told in previous books (Rachel's Holiday, Watermelon) about this whacky clan.  But now we see Maggie suffer two miscarriages, discover her husband is being unfaithful, and lose her job.  It's too much to bear so she hibernates in her family's Dublin home and nurses her wounds.  An invitation from her best-friend Emily, a struggling screenwriter wannabe in Los Angeles, sounds like just what the doctor ordered, so Maggie flys to California determined to shed her \\"just plain yogurt\\" reputation and prove she can be as wild as anyone.  Maggie throws herself into the California lifestyle of free sex, boozing till dawn, and a few other activities unusual for the family's \\"white sheep.\\"  In the midst of all the frivolity, Mammy and Daddy Walsh with sisters Helen and Anna in tow, come to visit.  Life gets a whole lot funnier with this group, especially Helen, on the scene.  To Maggie's complete surprise, estranged husband Garv arrives just as Maggie is reconnecting with the high school lover she never forgot.<br />This is a story of love and redemption told in first person by Maggie as she lives in the present but gives readers poignant flashbacks of what brought her to this point in her life.  Some hard problems---fear of pregnancy, infertility, abortion, and alternative lifestyles---are examined with a passion and realism that moves this beyond the fluffy chick lit you may have been expecting.	2002-10-04

His good friend, George Lomax, a high-ranking official in the Foreign Office, arranges a hunting party to be held at Chimneys.  The party is actually a cover for diplomatic intrigue.  Before the party is too far along, Christie serves up murder, blackmail, romance, mysterious strangers, and a case of mistaken identity.  There is also a bit of political information about a fictitious country called Herzoslovakia.  This book is often confusing, definitely improbable, but always fun.<br />I think that anyone who starts with this as their first Agatha Christie will not get a true picture of her work nor will they really see the depth of her genius.  However, it is very enjoyable for confirmed Christie lovers.<br />This book is notable for the introduction of Superintendent Battle of Scotland Yard, a man who will appear in several other Christie books including one of her very best, \\"Towards Zero.\\"	2002-09-29

From protagonist Miles Roby to his irascible father Max, his hauntingly sad mother Grace, his nemesis Mrs. Whiting, his touching daughter Tick, and many more, we are treated to people described so vividly they come to life and seem like the people we might know and want to either hang out with or avoid at all costs if we lived in Empire Falls.<br />There are too many plot lines to detail, but they all are brought together nicely and no reader is left with unanswered questions thanks to an interesting epilogue.<br />All the problems of seeking a better life but being relegated to the blue collar life of a mill town whose mill has long closed, are embodied in Miles Roby, reluctant proprietor of the town's grill.  In the opening pages he sees his teen-age daughter Tick walking home from school with a hunched back weighed down by her symbolic backpack representing all the problems she faces---the dissolution of her parents marriage, a stepfather she despises, a widening emotional gap with her mother, the dreaded loss of friends and social standing, and being coupled with the school's most tortured and disturbed student.<br />The story moves slowly but the characters are so richly drawn you will be totally engrossed and hard pressed to put this one down.

While Claire's story was told more light-heartedly in WATERMELON and sister Maggie's story was the subject of ANGELS, middle sister Rachel suffers the most serious problems in the family---drug and alcohol addiction.<br />I had put off reading this one for a long time fearing it would be too depressing, but after being captivated by Marian Keyes style in LUCY SULLIVAN IS GETTING MARRIED, LAST CHANCE SALOON and others, I decided to give this one a try.  Although the same biting humor is present and the wonderfully conversational tone is used by the first-person narrator, this book tackles a much more serious problem than her others and therefore packs a grimmer punch.<br />Though Rachel considers her drug abuse just a form of socializing, her family is justifiably concerned when she ends up in a New York City hospital nearly dead from an overdose.  They whisk her home to Dublin to a rehab center.  Adamant that she is not a druggie, Rachel only consents to being admitted because she hopes to meet rock stars and other celebrities.  What Rachel does encounter is other people like herself who abuse drugs, alcohol, food, sex, whatever. There are no celebs, just dowdy men clad in brown sweaters and unhappy women deep in denial.  She feels above them and takes a long time (nearly 400 pages) before she realizes that she too is an addict.<br />I thought the best part of this book was when she leaves rehab and struggles with staying clean and sober in the real world.  All is not rosy and Rachel hits rock bottom before winding up in the hospital again.  Can she ever come to terms with her parents perceived dislike of her?  Can she overcome her feelings of being the least pretty and least bright of the five Walsh sisters?  Will she reconcile with the friends she has hurt, the siblings she is jealous of, and the boyfriend who just can't take any more?<br />Rachel's journey is not a pleasant one.  Her situation is serious and only her hang-tough humor and deep vulnerability kept me rooting for her to overcome her demons.  Marian Keyes gives a disturbingly accurate portrayal of someone whose life has spun out of control and the long and difficult journey necessary to gain self-respect.end who just can't take any more?<br />Rachel's journey is not a pleasant one.

This book more fully explores Neighbor Dorothy's family life as well as the people she connects with and the influence she wields throughout the state.  The reader sees the world through the eyes of her son Bobby who longs for no greater honor than to become the Bubble Gum King of 1949 yet grows into a remarkable war hero and family man.  Along with her daughter Anna Lee, her husband Doc who is the town pharmacist, and her mother-in-law we see a picture of a family that is not only idyllic but realistic in their affections, problems, and experiences.<br />Delightful in all respects, this book takes you through the Korean War, the anti-war movement of the 60's, the political travails of country bumpkins who long for the national stage, the liberation of women, and other important factual events that colored the lives of the American people.  Real people mix with fictional in a story that is engrossing, satisfying, and hard to leave behind.  You'll treasure your time with Neighbor Dorothy from her first broadcast to her final sign-off and be glad to be a part of the lives of people who remember buying a Christmas dress for $1.50, being mesmerized by the department store window at Christmas, and thrilling to the sight of a new neon sign lighting up the main street.	2002-09-03

We are told from the very beginning that Alison is not what she seems, but the author diverts us in one direction while blindsiding us with the truth in a shocker of an ending.<br />Terry is a lonely, forty-year old nurse who inherited her mother's house when her mother passed away.  She herself had lived in the small cottage on the rear of the property and now rents it out to tenants.  The former tenant has mysteriously disappeared and now this new tenant appears to be a little too anxious to get close to Terry, a bit too immediately involved in Terry's life.  But what could Alison and her growing assortment of strange friends want from Terry?  Is it all a well-planned scam to bilk the lonely lady of her money, her home, her life?<br />Tension is high and emotions are raw as narrator Terry draws us deeper and deeper into her lonely life, her fascination coupled with fear of Alison, her slow descent into crazed paranoia.  Will she be able to overcome her fears?  Will she reveal Alison and her friends as the con artists she fears them to be?  And just who is this mysterious Alison Sims and what does she want from Terry?<br />Joy Fielding leads us on a wild ride with an elaborate labyrinth of carefully constructed clues that finally come together and explode on the final pages.

Their friendship is developed out of this tragedy and the three women stay in touch and form a support group.  They soon learn that each has one big regret in life and it will come as no surprise to the reader that each will turn her regret into her proudest accomplishment.<br />The problem I had with this book is that their regrets were very superficial.  Each woman is very wealthy and has a good life.  It is hard to empathize with wealthy, glamourous women who discover a hangnail on the way to their weekly manicure.<br />Kip is a middle-aged woman who had been a high school ice-skating superstar.  The fact that she wants to reclaim her ice-skating abilities seems trivial to me.  Shouldn't a woman in her 30's have a more substantial primary goal than relearning to ice-skate?  Nora has a fear of committment yet seems fairly cruel to the one man she claims to regret having loved and lost.  Eloise has a weight problem, but as the editor-in-chief of a leading magazine for women, couldn't a few trips to Weight Watchers or a personal trainer have solved her poor eating habits?  She didn't seem quite as upset about her husband leaving her for another woman, a problem I would have thought much more important.<br />Perhaps the fact that these women were so wealthy and had so many good things in their lives trivialized their problems. Perhaps the fact that the friendship seemed forced and not all that real was another drawback of this book.  Their initial meeting seemed forced and that set the tone for the rest of the book.  Friendship is more than a once-a week three-way phone call listing your &quot;best moment&quot; and &quot;worst moment&quot; of the week, but these three seemed to have no more than that.<br />Having said all this, I'd say the book is Ok, just not the best book on womens friendships I've read.  There were also too many characters introduced and dropped as well as a major situation concerning Kip's husband that came from out of left-field and was suppose to be the ultimate bonding experience for the three.<br />This is not a bad book, but in light of all the truly good books on women friendships out there, it is perhaps not the best choice.and dropped as well as a major situation concerning Kip's husband that came from out of left-field and was suppose to be the ultimate bonding experience for the three.<br />This is not a bad book, but in light of all the truly good books on women friendships out there, it is perhaps not the best choice.	2002-08-03

They bond in the blistering Egyptian heat and, since they all live fairly near one another, continue the friendship once they are back in Dublin.<br />Hannah is the insecure career girl who has been dumped by her boyfriend of ten years.  Can a career replace her need for romance?  Will one-night stands be enough to satisfy?  Can the handsome actor who fancies her provide lasting happiness?<br />Emma is a pathetic woman who even though married is being emotionally and verbally abused by her parents.

She lifts these books up from a banal girl-looking-for-guy novel and gives then something more, namely unforgettable characters the reader truly comes to care about.<br />Who could be more vulnerable than Claire whose husband James tells her on the day she gives birth to their first-born that he is leaving her for another woman in their apartment building?  Thus begins Claire's often sad, often comical, but always interesting saga.  She grabs her newborn and flies from London to the safe harbor of her parents home in Dublin.  There we meet her hilarious mother and father as well as two of her four sisters:  the self-involved Helen and the lovably flakey Anna.  (Guess Rachel was busy starring in RACHEL'S HOLDIAY and MAGGIE was caught up in her story as told in ANGELS.)  The Walsh family is not a model family, but it is one that you'll love being a part of --- the fights, the squabbles, the sisterly ritual of stealing clothes from one another, the tension amidst the camaraderie, the freezer with frozen food and the mother's aversion to home-cooked meals---all make Claire's stay less than peaceful.<br />Will she ever come to terms with what has happened to her?  Can she pull herself up from her quagmire of despair over losing James?  Can she be a fit and loving mother to Kate?  Will she stop toying with the idea of stealing her sister's boyfriend and just go ahead and do it?  Will Claire come to her senses and tell James off for good or will she go back to him?<br />Claire will steal your heart as her easy, conversational tone speaks to you just as she would to her best friend, in a breezy, self-deprecating style that keeps you eagerly turning the pages.	2002-07-06

The wives are best friends, the husbands very close, the children devoted to each other.  Into this idyllic setting come secrets, death, terminal illness, infidelity, divorce, and all the other elements that make for an interesting read.<br />Protagonist Lucy West married young and, although she loves her husband Max, she is vulnerable to other men.

I secretly doubted she could duplicate the magic of the aforementioned book, but she did!  The story is completely different, but the same compelling style of writing reels you in and makes you never want to put the book down.<br />You will be completely involved in Mattie Hart's life from the opening line when she is thinking of ways to kill her philandering husband to the unthinkable request she makes of her mother.  You will be struck by the inner strength this woman brings to her life as well as to that of her family and deeply touched by the graphic description of a terminal illness.<br />Jake Hart, her husband, is an interesting creation.  He doesn't love his wife, never has.  He only married her because she was pregnant and Jake always likes to do the right thing.  He constantly cheats on Mattie throughout their sixteen years of marriage and has never said \\"I love you\\" to her.  So what's to like about a man like this?  Amazingly, Fielding is able to present a side of Jake that touches every emotional note and leaves you rooting for this multi-faceted character.<br />From a comical steak-throwing spree in a Chicago grocery store to a wildly romantic chase through a Paris airport, Mattie and Jake's story will leave you breathless.  Add to the mix their daughter Kim who is experiencing her first sexual misadventure and Mattie's mother who could never love her daughter like she needed to be loved.<br />THE FIRST TIME explores the ties that bind and the power of love to overcome the deepest wounds people can inflict upon one another.

She's too lazy to do her laundry, too dumb to realize her father is an alcoholic, and too ungrateful to appreciate the people who treat her nicely.  But there is something about this vulnerable Irish girl plugging away at a dead-end job in London, sharing alcoholic binges with workmates and roommates that touched me. Maybe it was her desperate need to be loved, her witty repartee with herself and others, or just the universal quest to find that special person that touched me, but by book's end I was screaming for it not to end.  I wanted more of Lucy, Daniel, Karen, Meredia, Megan, Charlotte, and even Gus. . . well, maybe I'd had enough of Gus.<br />We first meet Lucy when she and her co-workers are about to visit a fortune teller.  One glance into her crystal ball and the fortune teller sees marriage for Lucy within 18 months.  But Lucy has no prospects having just broken up with Stephen because he treats her too nice.  At first skeptical, but becoming hopeful as her two workmates have their fortunes come true, Lucy eagerly picks up the first man she meets at a party and tags him the future Mr. Lucy Sullivan.  Too bad he has no home, no money, no job, nothing but a loud mouth and lots of nerve.  But Lucy is in love and defends the loathsome Gus to everyone including her best friend Daniel. When Gus disappears, Daniel becomes intimate with her roommate, and a new man comes into the office, things get even funnier.

The reader first meets them one week after graduation at the wedding of one of the girls and follows them for over 400 pages until they are all reunited seven years later at the funeral of one of the group.  Along the way we are given a lesson in social history as we share their courtships and marriages and take a hard look at the social mores of the 30's.  Mental illness, virginity, the breast v. bottle debate, and political upheaval all come up for examination as the girls reach the conclusion that an education, even the very best one, does not guarantee emotional balance. This is a sometimes profound, sometimes hard-biting satirical look at American women in the important period between the two World Wars.<br />In 1966 the novel was transferred to the big screen with an all-star cast featuring Candice Bergen as Elinor Eastlake, the group leader.  Though much of the book's and the movie's shock value  (the lesbian issue) has been lost in the 21st century, this still remains a viable novel on women and the bonds they forge.	2002-05-16

He receives a letter from the elderly lady in which she hints at a possible attempt on her life.  When Poirot realizes the letter had been written two months before he receives it, his little grey cells are alerted.  He takes a trip to Market Basing only to find the writer of the letter, Miss Arundell, is dead.  Since he considers her still his client, he is determined to prove her death was not accidental, but a deliberate murder.  The cold trail of clues leads to a beautiful society lady, a handsome scientist, a faithful servant, and a pair of specialists in the occult.  Will Poirot be able to unmask the killer before another death occurs?  A dog's bouncing ball, a strange spiritual manifestation, and a mirror reflection of a brooch are all pivotal to solving this mystery.<br />This book is notable in that it will be the last of the Poirot books to be narrated by Captain Hastings until \\"Curtain\\" ends the series decades later.  His narrative style, always pleasing, is especially well-done in this one.  Also notable in this story is the importance of a cute wire-haired terrier named Bob who will form a special bond with Captain Hastings.<br />If greed, deception, and jealousy are your cup of cocoa, you'll love matching wits with Hercule Poirot as he tries to stop a brilliant and baffling killer who is about to strike again.	2002-05-04

The story is frivolous and funny thanks in large part to the wit of Lady Frances, but you will find the usual murder, villains, and high adventure in this melodramatic tale.<br />While golfing one afternoon, Bobby and the local doctor find a man who has apparently fallen over a cliff.  The victim dies, but his last words are \\"Why didn't they ask Evans?\\"  A verdict of accidental death ensues, but when Bobby is suddenly offered a high-paying job in Argentina and later someone attempts to poison his beer, he begins to suspect that someone wants him out of the way for fear of what he knows. Bobby cannot figure out what he knows, but with the help of Lady Frances he is off on a trail of clues involving a suspicious doctor, a sanitarium for the highly nervous, two beautiful ladies-in-distress, drugs, and murder.<br />If you like light-hearted mystery with plenty of adventure, you'll enjoy being led on this merry chase with likeable sleuths.  It's too bad Agatha Christie chose not to bring Bobby and Frances back in later books.  Perhaps, she thought they were too much like Tommy and Tuppence.	2002-04-28

Long before Hitler, Mussolini, or even Osama Bin Laden, Agatha Christie created a number of novels with the master-criminal-out-to-rule-the world theme.  This time she gives us not one, but four such people:  an extremely wealthy American, a powerful Oriental, a famous French scientist, and the elusive fourth.  It is Poirot's mission to discover who the fourth person is and save the world from mass destruction.  The adventure is highlighted by a visit from Poirot's faithful companion, Captain Arthur Hastings, who happens to be on a visit from his new home in Argentina.  Poirot is always sharper when Hastings is around, and this book makes clear why the duo is a favorite of mystery lovers around the world.<br />Also notable in this book is the introduction of Achille Poirot, alleged brother of the famous Hercule.  (If Sherlock could have Mycroft, why can't Hercule have Achille?)<br />My only criticism of this might be the sometimes bumpy construction, but it should be read more as a series of short stories rather than a cohesive novel.

This is, in my opinion, one of the best, and begins when Elspeth McGillicuddy, a friend of Miss Marple's, is returning from Christmas shopping in London and on her way to visit Jane in St. Mary Mead. Her train is running alongside another one on a nearby track, and Mrs. McGillicuddy has an excellent view inside the parallel carriage of the other train. What she sees is the back of a man strangling a woman. No one believes Mrs. McGillicuddy since no corpse is found and no injured woman turns up at any hospital. Only Miss Marple believes her friend. Although Mrs. McGillicuddy is leaving for Ceylon to spend Christmas with her son, Miss Marple continues her quest to prove her friend's story. First she books passage on the same train and narrows the search for where a body should have been thrown to the area around Rutherford Hall, the large family estate of the Crackenthorpes. The family consists of the semi-invalided and grouchy Mr. Crackenthorpe, his daughter Emma, three sons, a son-in-law, and a grandson. At least four of the men are likely candidates for the strangler.<br />Because Miss Marple is not young enough to physically search for the body in unknown territory, she engages Lucy Eyelesbarrow, one of Christie's most interesting female creations. Lucy quickly gains employment at Rutherford Hall as a domestic and busily does all the legwork for Miss Marple. Meanwhile, Jane Marple has taken up residence at a nearby home and advises and assists Lucy.<br />In 1961, this became the basis for \\"Murder, She Said,\\" the first of four films starring Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple. Although it deviates from the book, most notably in the omission of Lucy, it is enjoyable and worth viewing.	2002-04-27

Books	4	57	57	N	N	Welcome to Both Sides of the Mason-Dixon Line, Baby Girl	Fannie Flagg serves up a hefty helping of Southern humor in this sometimes funny, sometimes melodramatic, but always interesting story.  Baby Girl is Dena Nordstrom of Elmwood Springs, Missouri, who becomes one of the top tv journalists in New York City.  She learns a lot of lessons in the big city, such as tv news has no ethics, tabloid shows are what America wants, and people with no morals rise to the top.  When Dena crashes from the stress of big city living, she goes back home (against her will) to be coddled and loved by her extended family.  The very best parts of this book take place below the Mason-Dixon line as cousin Norma and her husband Mackey Warren delight readers with their down-to-earth goodness and hysterically funny dialogue.  Also adding to the fun is Kappa sorority sister extraordinaire Sookie from Selma, Alabama, the complete antithesis of Dena.  Sookie is a devoted wife and mother, a born-again Christian, but mostly she is a loving friend who never forgets that being a Kappa is the ultimate achievement for all women. Flagg describes small-town living perfectly and captures all the love, humor, and genuine neighborly concern that small towns have become famous for.  Lucky for Dena, because she has a major crisis to confront.  Things become serious when Dena delves into her past and searches for the mother who abandoned her many years ago.  The climax of this novel is surprising and totally unique.  I was shocked at what I learned about Dena's mother and overcome with emotion at the poignancy of the story.<br />But the reason this book appealed to me so much was primarily due to Neighbor Dorothy, the first character we meet and the one whose spirit hovers over the entire story.  As Flagg moves back and forth from the forties to the eighties and all points in between, we get a picture of what it is like to grow up in a loving environment and how it stays with you and reaches out to help you no matter how far away you roam.  So curl up with Dena, her friends, neighbors, and shrinks, and most of all Neighbor Dorothy, for a bittersweet trip North and South and see which world is the one for Dena., her friends, neighbors, and shrinks, and most of all Neighbor Dorothy, for a bittersweet trip North and South and see which world is the one for Dena.	2002-04-01

Having loved Dorothea Benton Frank's second novel, Plantation, I was anxious to go back and read her first one that I had missed.  Thankfully, this one is just as good and as much of a can't-put-down-book as Plantation was.<br />The author takes us back and forth in time between 1999 and 1963, the pivotal year that forever touched the life of Susan Hamilton Hayes.  When we meet her in 1999, she is a harried working woman with a handsome husband and a hormone-driven teenage daughter.  When Susan rushes home on her lunch hour one day and finds her husband in bed with another woman, life takes an unexpected turn.  You'll cry a lot and laugh even more as Susan takes life with its unexpected slap in the face yet retains her humor and resourcefulness.  You'll love going back in time to seeing Susan as a young girl growing up in a family of six children on Sullivan's Island.  Her older sister Maggie and her brothers Timmy and Henry will touch your heart as they stand strong and united against an abusive father and a weak and helpless mother.  The writing is fast-paced and so mesmerizing that you will smell the water of Sullivan's Island, taste the red beans and rice, gaze into the magical mirror, and yearn for a housekeeper like the wonderful Gullah woman Livvie who is the saving grace in the Hamilton family.  The author not only gives us wonderfully unforgettable characters, but heart-tugging situations involving raising teens, reconciling with a wayward husband, coping with terminal illness, and, oh yes, the importance of having a pedicure before sex.<br />Mainly, this book is about love and finding that real love transcends death, heals hearts, changes minds, and gives us courage.  So pick up this book and get involved in Susan's life---from her first bikini wax to her final talk with Livvie, this one will have you begging for more from a great new writer I'm happy to have discovered.	2002-04-01

He doesn't disappoint with &quot;The Notebook&quot; as he weaves the tale of two teenagers, Noah and Allie, who meet one fateful summer and fall in love.  Since the course of true love is never smooth, it should come as no surprise that Allie's parents do not approve of her relationship with Noah.  He does not have the education, money, or social prominence they wish for their daughter. Allie and her parents move away and Noah writes to her for years, but after never receiving an answer gives up.  WWII comes, lives change, but one thing remains constant---neither Allie nor Noah can forget the other. As Noah's friend Gus tells him, first love changes your life forever and no matter what else happens in your life, the memory of it stays with you.  And so it is that fourteen years later and three weeks before her wedding, Allie finds herself driving to New Bern to find Noah for reasons she herself does not fully understand. Their reunion proves once again that they are true soulmates, but it that enough?  Can Allie forsake the &quot;perfect mate&quot; who has not only her love but also the approval of her parents?  Can she walk out on Noah for a second time?  Will Noah let her go?  The story then skips to the nursing home where an 80-year old Noah resides and spends his time reading poetry to his fellow residents.  But down the hall is a very special woman.  The reader will be overcome with emotion as this relationship unfolds and the missing pieces of Noah and Allie's story are revealed in the notebook he carries with him.  Intensely romantic and a tribute to the power of true love, &quot;The Notebook&quot; will leave you emotionally spent and thankful to be so.	2002-03-16

This was my first book of hers and I was totally captivated by her unforgettable characters and unique storyline twists.<br />What is it about the Irish that make them such wonderful storytellers?  The plot sounds very simple---two single women and one gay man, all best friends since their childhood in a small Irish village, find happiness and heartache as professional thirtysomethings in London.  Sounds simple, but in the hands of a great storyteller this is a can't-put-down novel.<br />The situations faced by Tara, Katherine, and Fintan are so true-to-life and yet so heartbreaking, that the reader feels compelled to hold their hands and walk with them through every step of their angst.  You will meet Tara Butler who suffers from low self-esteem and the misfortune to be living with the boyfriend from hell, Katherine Casey, the ice princess who has let a mysterious event from her past color and destroy any relationship she enters, and Fintan O'Grady, the flamboyant homosexual who has found his soul mate but risks losing everything to a terminal illness.  Not only are these characters remarkable creations, but Keyes gives us as fine a lineup of secondary characters as can be found in any novel.  Most notable is Lorcan Larkin, the enigmatic actor whose story parallels that of the main characters and finally collides with one of them in a heartbreaking climax.<br />This is a story of modern day singles, but it is so much more.  It is a testament to friendship and the ties that give us strength.  It is a look at the long shadows a family can cast and the ways people can take control of their own destiny. Most importantly, it is about learning to respect yourself and to live each day as if it were your last chance.	2002-03-12

A friend insisted I read this since she considered it not only a great romance but also because of the interesting aspect of time travel.  After reading all 505 pages, some highly interesting and some not so interesting, I think I will stick with her mainstream work.<br />Now, don't get me wrong.  The book was enjoyable.  If you can accept the idea of time travel and believe that two men from the 23rd century find their way to 1990's Oregon, you are in for a treat.  The humor of their situation is played beautifully.  Their inability to manipulate a stove, recognize a radio, or understand current phrases is comical.  The sexual tension is great with many, many pages devoted to sexual attraction and union, the cutting edge of erotic writing that has made Nora Roberts beloved by millions.<br />The book appears to be a compilation of two previous works.  In the first, \\"Time Was,\\" Caleb Hornblower is sucked into a black hole and finds himself at a mountain cabin in Oregon, the residence of one Liberty (Libby) Stone.  The attraction is immediate, the sex passionate,and the ending extremely romantic.  In the second book,\\"Times Change,\\" Caleb's brother Jacob comes to fetch him home.  Since Caleb and Libby are on vacation, the only person he finds at the cabin is Libby's sister Sunbeam (Sunny) who is spending some time alone and deciding what to do with the rest of her life.  Jacob and Sunny have a feisty yet passionate affair that will probably come to an end when he leaves to return to the 23rd century.  Or will it?  Can two smart and savvy women find love with men who will be born long after the women will die? Can flying in and out of black holes and going from century to century really be possible?  Can the reader accept any of this and find the story satisfying?  To a great extent, yes.  My only complaint is that there is much repetition and the story goes on about 200 pages too long.  Nora has been blessed with better editing and tighter writing in her later books. However, this one is definitely worth reading if you are a fan of her romances.ges too long.

Dame Agatha wrote this during the 1940's, a period that critics agree was when she did her best work.<br />The crime in this book is the murder of the brilliant painter Amyas Crayle.  His wife is convicted of the crime and sent to prison.  However, their young daughter is now of age and receives a letter from her mother professing her innocence.  The daughter turns to the famous Hercule Poirot for help.  If the wife is innocent, Poirot must look a the five people who were present at the time of the crime---hence, the \\"five little pigs.\\"  In true nursery rhyme fashion, one little pig went to market (financial counsellor), one little pig stayed home (thanks to an inheritance), one little pig had roast beef (had made a good marriage), one little pig had none (retired teacher with limited income), and one little pig cried all the way home (a woman with a disfiguring facial scar).<br />One of the most interesting aspects of this book is that Poirot will get an account of the murder from each of the five characters.  At the end of these five accounts, you will have all the information that Poirot has and can try your hand at out-detecting the master.<br />This is a great detective story and, in my opinion, one of the best by Agatha Christie.	2002-03-02

How wrong I was!  This is funnier than the original (a hard act to follow) and Becky continues to be the designer-loving fashion plate who was born to shop.<br />Life looks good for Becky as she spouts financial advice on her tv show, finds romance with Luke, and continues to wrap her bank manager Derek Smeath around her pinkie.  But when Mr. Smeath retires from Endwich Bank and Luke announces he wants to make it big in New York, big changes are in store(literally) for Becky.  She takes to New York like an angel to heaven, or as she so succintly says, \\"These are my people.  I've found my homeland.\\"  Becky has never been happier and the reader is treated to Becky hyperventilating at a Prada sample sale, seeing the Guggenheim in a unique way, winning the attention of employees at Barney's, all while taking a three-hour group walking tour of New York that turns into a thousand dollar shopping day when the tour director invites them to enter a magnificent place of worship and Becky enters Saks rather than St. Patrick's. But an unplanned event sends Becky into a depression and destroys her relationship with Luke.  Will Becky recover?  How will she muddle through without job or boyfriend?  Will the new bank manager succumb to her charms or demand full payment? Is it possible for Becky to live up to her own catch phrase she preaches to her loyal viewers, \\"Look after your money...and your money will look after you.\\"<br />Every page is filled with Beckyisms, wise words on shopping that are hysterically funny in light of our heroine's \\"tragic flaw.\\"  Will Becky rise from the ashes? Can she win the battle of the charge cards and live a debt-free life?  From London to New York, to my mind there's not a more endearing heroine than Becky Bloomwood nor a more compelling contemporary writer of \\"chick lit\\" than the witty Sophie Kinsella.<br />Pick up a copy of this book and I guarantee you'll smile every time you see a Denny and George scarf or a Vera Wang dress.emporary writer of \\"chick lit\\" than the witty Sophie Kinsella.<br />Pick up a copy of this book and I guarantee you'll smile every time you see a Denny and George scarf or a Vera Wang dress.	2002-02-23

You'll also savor excerpts from famous stories and plays such as Pride and Prejudice, The Velveteen Rabbit, the famous balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet, and much more.  My favorite section is the love poems, thirty hearfelt selections including the flawless &quot;To My Dear and Loving Husband&quot; by Anne Bradstreet as well as works by Shakespeare, Yeats, Lord Byron, and more romantic souls.<br />But don't think of this as just a literary anthology.  Besides being one of the best in that genre, it also includes tempting meals as a prelude to a night of love.  Complete aphrodisiac meals plus tempting desserts like the ultimate chocolate mousse and lemon hearts are guaranteed to keep the Valentine feeling year-long.  You'll also find a recipe for fortune cookies which allows you to put in your own message.  The recipe is footnoted with lots of suggestions to get your mind brainstorming,  like &quot;Birds do it, bees do it, we'll do it tonight&quot; or any  other messages you'd like to convey.<br />A final section includes love songs from the likes of Cole Porter, Johnny Mercer, the Gershwins, and others.  Of course, for days after reading these lyrics, I found myself constantly humming &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot; by Al Dubin and Harry Warren.<br />Every page is illustrated with full-color images, over half from the early twentieth-century.  They enhance the words, even those from people I never thought of as particularly romantic (Woodrow Wilson, e.e. cummings, John Adams, to name a few). So nice to know that love is truly a universal feeling that touches us all!<br />This anthology is a pure delight, guaranteed to keep love in your plans 365 days a year.	2002-02-16

Instead she created many subplots and by the last page had not tied up all the loose ends.  There were many questions left unanswered and I wondered if perhaps the printer had deleted the last chapters by error.  Surely, no author would leave everything up in the air the way Sarah Woodhouse did. What writer would have two murders committed and leave the reader not knowing who committed them?<br />Another major flaw in this novel is that none of the characters were well-defined or likeable.  Only with Nan, the protagonist, did we get an inkling of why she was such a spineless, weak-willed person.  How lovely it would have been if something had happened to let her begin to grow into a stronger person.  But, no.  Sorry to say, by book's end Nan had shown zero growth.<br />Many other characters played into numerous sub-plots, but none were well-defined enough to care about.  Their stories were left hanging in mid-air and the reader was left with more questions than answers.<br />I would love to ask the author how she selected &quot;Meeting Lily&quot; as the title of her book.  Who got to meet this woman who was alluded to on a few occasions?  Certainly not any reader who shelled out money for this book or hung around for 277 pages.<br />If you're looking for an interesting story rich with the local color of Italy, look elsewhere.

For everyone who enjoys a novel with humor, distinctive local color, and amazing insights into self-discovery, this is a MUST read.<br />The story begins at the funeral of Miss Lavinia and her daughter Caroline takes us on a tour of pivotal moments that led to this day.  The family relationships that bind us, the heritage we can run from but never escape, the unending parade of people who leave their prints on the canvas of our lives, are all examined with wit and passion.  Dorothea Benton Frank is remarkable in the way she draws you into the story and makes you a part of life with Caroline.  In New York or back at Tall Pines Plantation, I felt like Caroline's shadow, suffering every indignity with her, rejoicing in every happy event with her.<br />Caroline's journey of self-discovery leads her to some revealing truths about the nature of mother-daughter relationships, the misunderstandings that bruise hearts, the reunions that make us realize no matter how our lives differ from our mothers, we are forever and thankfully so our mother's daughter, her true and lasting spitting image.<br />So curl up with Caroline and her nearest and dearest: Trip, her hard-drinking brother and quintessential Southern good ole boy; her trashy sister-in-law Frances Mae; her surrogate mother and housekeeper Millie; her precocious son Eric; her repulsive husband Richard, and most of all Miss Lavinia, the larger-than-life mother Caroline must come to terms with before she can become the person she was destined to be.	2002-02-04

Fortunately, my own Italian-American family has always been the huggy, kissy kind and not the dark one portrayed by Rita Ciresi.  Nevertheless, I know these people, their idiosyncrasies, the fact that Mama always knows best, the fact that Papa puts the roof over your head and doesn't need to do anything else.  Readers will laugh out loud at the blatant humor of a home where furniture kept under plastic wraps is the height of elegance, where a Rey Corono cigar band ring from your father is life's most precious treasure, and where no one else can embarrass you on a trip like good ole Mama Mia.  Whether recalling the desire to &quot;americanize&quot; your name or listening to the music of &quot;Celeste Aida&quot; while doing housework, this book is a nostalgic look back at not only what it's like to grow up in an Italian-American home, but in any ethnic home.  Ciresi peppers the writing with lots of Italian words and phrases (how many times these same words came tumbling from my own grandparents' lips) and portrays the characters with a poignancy that puts the reader immediately into the story and into the lives of Angel and Lina.  These two sisters want more than anything else to escape their heritage, but find as adults that it is the memories of it that bind them forever.<br />Heartwarming, heart-wrenching, and heartfelt---this book is a trip down memory lane for many, a chance to find out what it's like to grow up Italian for those not lucky enough to be able to do it in their real life.	2002-01-17

Patrick Delaney's story is told in three time frames:  as an 18-year-old American fighting in France during World War I; ten years later when he meets Julia, the girl his best friend Daniel loves, and as an 81-year-old in a nursing home awaiting death and hoping that his final words are more profound than &quot;Where's my Metamuscil?&quot;<br />From the bloody war scenes to the romantic love scenes, this book offers readers the most intriguing love triangle I have come across in literature. Patrick spends his life struggling between love and loss, having his obsession with Julia change his life, destroy his marriage, but give him something to hope for, something to look back on and smile about.  Readers will laugh and cry, often on the same page, as an old man suffers the indignities of impending death yet remembers the high points of his youth.  There are so many memorable passages in this book that I literally took a highlighter pen and marked them so I could go back and read certain parts over and over.  It's most unusual for me to deface a book in this way, but this is one not only to read for the pure pleasure of the story but also to glean insights from the author's extraordinary reflections on the human spirit.  Patrick learns from Julia what really matters in life---having someone to love, being compassionate, being fully alive every day so that you really see and hear and smell and feel things.  Julia gives Patrick that chance to never be lonely as her spirit remains with him every day of his life.<br />Share Patrick's life, the deep distress that humanizes him, the humor that sustains him, and the love that he could never forget.  I doubt anyone who reads this book will ever forget Patrick or Julia or Daniel---and what the three of them meant to each other.	2002-01-11

They overlap his story with the very earthly tale of a little girl and the danger a pair of no-good gangster brothers pose for her. Readers will recognize Mary Higgins Clark's genius for creating a variety of characters and pinpointing the motivations that precede their actions.  Readers will certainly sympathize with Sterling Brooks as he learns the power of caring for others---a trait he somehow missed in his earthly life--- before he can cross the bridge to Heaven.  The laugh-out-loud humor of daughter Carol's previous works is unmistakable as the reader is treated to the bumbling Badgett Brothers, despicable and somewhat stereotypical bad boys redeemed only by their totally unselfish love for their wily Mama.  The first description that came to my mind was The Blues Brothers Meet It's A Wonderful Life.<br />The authors dedicate this book to the victims of the September 11, 2001 tragedy, to the families and friends who loved them, and to the rescuers who risked their own lives to help them.  Certainly it is refreshing to see New York's traditional yuletide trimmings written about---the skating rink at Rockefeller Center, the windows at Sak's, the sanctity of St. Patrick's Cathedral, and more---to remind us that this indestructible city is still alive and well.<br />Many authors choose to tell a Christmas tale and take a step off their normal path.  I consider this one the very best to come out in this holiday season.  Although it may lack the riveting suspense we normally associate with Mary Higgins Clark, it is an original twist on a warm and fuzzy story that satisfies, refuses to let you put it down, and warms the heart in a way we all need at this special season of loving and giving.  So if you are looking for a quick, feel-good read that leaves visions of sugarplums dancing in your head, pick up this very special little book and give yourself a Christmas present you'll enjoy.t leaves visions of sugarplums dancing in your head, pick up this very special little book and give yourself a Christmas present you'll enjoy.	2001-12-29

Carol Lynn Pearson tells the tale of Robert, a little boy we meet on his first day of school.  He is joyful as he solves his very first problem:  One plus one equals what?  As the years go by, the problems get bigger, but Robert manages to solve them and move on.  The problems are no longer as much fun, but still must be solved.  Sometimes Robert wants to run away from the problem and sometimes the problem makes him cry.  Many times he longs for the simple problems like he had on the first day of school.<br />The reader spends a lifetime with Robert and sees him learn the greatest lesson of all when he realizes all his life there had only been one problem---How much do you love and who will remember you after you are gone?<br />A warm, feel-good book for children as well as adults, this beautifully illustrated fable is a quick, satisfying read with a lesson to last a lifetime.	2001-12-29

Two psychopaths, a wayward husband, and a battle with God Himself spice up Agatha's life as she runs the gamut of emotions from grief to anger.<br />As a devoted fan of this rascally British matron since she made her first appearance in &quot;Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death,&quot; I felt for her as she suffered through an incredibly disastrous marriage to longtime love James Lacey, anguished over his disappearance, and didn't know if he were dead or alive.<br />In order to solve the mystery surrounding James, Agatha teams up with friend Sir Charles Fraith who retains all the gentlemanly charm yet outright stinginess readers have come to expect.  Old friends like Mrs. Bloxby, Bill Wong, and Ron Silver also appear as Agatha tries to come to terms with the mess James has made of her life.<br />Be prepared for some laugh-out-loud moments as Agatha's rudeness and irritability lead to some comic moments with suspects as well as the parents of Bill Wong whom we met in earlier adventures.<br />Longtime fans will stand up and cheer as a stronger, more secure Agatha emerges at book's closing.  The only question I had while reading was the same one I have had in all the books so far....just what does she see in James Lacey?	2001-12-20

His only child is off in the jungles of Peru working with the Peace Corps, so why should he and his wife blow another $6,000 on useless gifts, gaudy decorations, and tossing a party.  For only half that amount they could spend ten glorious days sunning in the Caribbean.  And so Luther's plan is set in motion.  For this one year, the Kranks will skip Christmas, skip the hassle, skip the frantic shopping, skip all the commericalized glory that has cast a shadow on the true meaning of Christmas.<br />Can they do it?  Can they forego buying a tree?  Can they break it to the neighbors they will not mount their Frosty on the roof?  Can they turn down all the charities that want a helping hand? Can they disappoint their friends and not toss their annual Christmas Eve bash?<br />Grisham does turn a bit sappy at the end, but I loved the beauty of Luther's final scene with the Scheels and his satisfaction in delivering the perfect gift.<br />This is a witty, clever, fast-paced read that made me laugh out loud in many parts.

Each section begins with an introduction from Caroline that relates some interesting information about Jackie, how she raised her children, her spirit of adventure, her trips into imaginary places, and her belief in the importance of love and family.  Poetry was a daily part of life in the Kennedy home and you'll find interesting information on the poetry scrapbooks that Jackie encouraged her children to keep, the poems they memorized for family gatherings, and more.<br />Although most of the poems contained in this volume may be already familiar to the seasoned reader, you will find three original poems by Jackie herself as well as an essay taken from a book she helped put together.  From the poem Robert Frost read at JFK's inauguration to Rose Kennedy's favorite she recited often, you'll enjoy this trip back to Camelot.  My personal favorite that I was so happy to find included in this volume was the beautiful &quot;Ithaca&quot; by Constantine P. Cavafy.  This, as you may recall, was the poem Jackie's friend Maurice Tempelsman read at her funeral.  Its message of enjoying the journey, the &quot;beautiful voyage&quot; seems to exemplify more than any the private lady we all admired.	2001-12-02

Just when Miss Julia was getting on with her life and actually enjoying being free of the overbearing, pompous, and hypocritcal Wesley Lloyd Springer, his bleached blonde mistress and pathetic little son show up and change Miss Julia's life in ways she never expected.  As she often reminds the reader, she never asked for any of this.  But what she gets is heart-warming, fast-paced, and hysterically funny.<br />The story may be slightly far-fetched, but the characters are so typically Southern---from the unscrupulous and conniving pastor to the slick televangelist and the down-home lawyer--- that you'll fall in love with this unlikely mix of characters and delight in the ways they touch each other's lives.<br />I can't wait to read the sequel &quot;Miss Julia Takes Over&quot; cause I'm sure she will.

The current owner, a professor, is considering destroying the work to make amends for his Nazi father's sins.  The future of the painting remains in doubt, but its history unfolds in a remarkable series of vignettes.  Most notable to me was the story of a young farm wife who, in the midst of trying to survive a great flood, finds the painting with an abandoned baby boy in a boat.  An attached note says &quot;Sell the painting.  Feed the child.&quot;  The reader is also treated to other stories including that of a young Jewish girl, a middle-aged man who remembers his first love that he lost, a couple whose marriage dissolves---all these events and more witnessed silently by the young girl in the painting.<br />If you enjoy period pieces and revel in being part of the poignant moments in the lives of people,  you will enjoy this remarkable little story.	2001-11-14

One reason is that Agatha Christie does in this novel what she does best---gathers an extended family all under one roof, allows one of the family to be murdered, and shows quite clearly that all the others had motive and opportunity.<br />&quot;Crooked House&quot; is an excellent story of a complex family. The patriarch is Aristide Leonides, a Greek who has come to England and made a fortune in the restaurant and catering business.  His mansion is home to his two sons, two daughters-in-law, three grandchildren, his first wife's sister, and now to his young and beautiful second wife plus the grandchildren's tutor.  When the wealthy old man is poisoned, the reader learns that everyone had not only a motive but also an alibi.  The characterizations are wonderful and the characters stand out as some of Mrs. Christie's most memorable ones.<br />The usual detectives are absent in this one, but the detecting is in the capable hands of Charles Hayward, the son of a Scotland Yard detective and the fiance of Aristide's granddaughter Sophia Leonides.  When the blood-chilling ending occurs, one is shocked and yet, on careful reexamination, must admit that all the clues were clearly there.<br />Curl up with a cup of cocoa (unpoisoned, of course) and enjoy this classic crime with one of Mrs. Christie's most spectacular and unforgettable endings.	2001-10-31

I love the way she writes about real people with real problems, real emotions, and real solutions.  In this novel, we meet four women--a dedicated school psychologist whose biggest wish is to become pregnant, a savvy businesswoman married to Mr. Mom, the supermom who leads every school committee but can't control her philandering husband, and the rich, young, widow who is pregnant by an unknown lover.  Naturally, all the other three women on the cul-de-sac suspect their husband of being the father.  Each marriage is under just enough stress to cause each wife to jump to this conclusion.  But which one will be correct?<br />This is the stuff soap operas are made of, but if you want something light and easy to wrap yourself in for a few days, this is the book for you.  Delinsky accurately portrays the stress of not being able to conceive, the pressure of being married to a wayward husband, the guilt of letting your career separate you from your family, and the loneliness of the neighborhood &quot;outsider.&quot;  She also adds the drama of a teen suicide and enough sexually-charged scenes to keep you turning the pages.	2001-10-18

I absolutely loved the story of Miles Ryan and his young son Jonah.  Their wife and mother, Missy, is struck down by a hit-and-run driver, sending waves of loneliness through the lives of Miles and Jonah.  Miles, as deputy sheriff of his small North Carolina town, feels doubly saddened by his failure to find his wife's killer and bring him to justice.<br />When Jonah has trouble at school, Sarah, Jonah's teacher, enters Miles' life and he begins to feel the stirrings of romance once again.  Unfortunately, Sarah harbors a secret that destroyed her first marriage, and later discovers an amazing coincidence that shatters her new-found happiness with Miles and Jonah.<br />Written with passion and simplicity, this wonderful book also has tones of Mary Higgins Clark, as readers are able to spend several chapters in the mind of the as-yet-unknown driver of the car who killed Missy.  The mystery of unveiling the hit-and-run driver coupled with the romance of Sarah and Miles makes this a comforting, curl-up-and-read pleasure for fall.	2001-10-16

Christie gives us her version of Scrooge in crusty ole curmudgeon Simeon Lee who has amassed a fortune in the diamond mines of South Africa. As Christmas approaches, he invites all his family, many of them long-estranged, to spend the holidays at his palatial estate Gorston Hall. Christie proceeds to do what she does best---she gathers a group of diverse characters related by blood or marriage, reveals their worst traits, and allows one person to be murdered while pointing the finger at each of the survivors. Simeon Lee has concocted a sadistic game to play on his family. The game begins when he allows his family to hear him give instructions to his lawyer to change his will. The game continues when he gives each of them a thorough dressing down for their weaknesses, stupidity, and greed. The game reaches a climax in Simeon's study where one person is found with a slashed throat.<br />&quot;Murder for Christmas&quot; was also published as &quot;A Holiday for Murder&quot; and &quot;Hercule Poirot's Christmas.&quot; It is notable not only as an excellent example of the locked-room mystery, but also as the most bloody of the Christie mysteries. Noted for her cozy murders via poisoned chocolates and a foreign substance in the afternoon tea, in this one Christie gives us all the blood and gore she is capable of. Her brother-in-law had requested that she come up with a &quot;good violent murder with lots of blood&quot; and this is her answer to him hoping it will satsify his lust.  Though not anywhere close to today's violence on tv, this is the bloodiest of the genteel novels Dame Agatha wrote.<br />Unfortunately for the clever murderer, Hercule Poirot happens to be spending Christmas with the Chief Constable of the county and is therefore conveniently on hand to assist in sifting through the many red herrings and false identities that make this novel complex and exciting.<br />If you're yearning for a good old-fashioned English country-house Christmas with lots of interesting characters on hand, you'll find this one most satisfying.yearning for a good old-fashioned English country-house Christmas with lots of interesting characters on hand, you'll find this one most satisfying.	2001-09-23

Eleven-year-old Alice, the most precocious and endearing pre-teen narrator to come along since Scout in &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird,&quot; tells the story in first-person. Alice is daring, loyal, spunky, but most of all she is cynical. And she is most cynical of her new stepfather Simon Jester, a car salesman who claims he could no longer deceive people, so has instead appointed himself &quot;God's megaphone.&quot; Convinced that Simon murdered his first family, Alice and her brother Boone become convinced Simon is trying to poison their food. She fights him in the only ways she knows---putting hair remover in his shampoo, Tabasco in his lemondade, scratches on his car---all the while trying to convince her mother of the man's true intentions. At first, her mother brushes these allegations off, but when one night she tells Alice and Boone to run, they do indeed run. When they team up with the notorious girl whom Boone has loved from afar, the parent-poisoning Persely Snow, their lives become one mind-boggling adventure after another. But all is not what it seems, and before Alice can come to terms with her many traumas and enjoy the sweet nectar life has to offer, she must deal with a brain-damaged neighbor, twins who prey on helpless creatures, a dimwitted dog, dead bees, and alienation from the brother she adores.<br />You won't find another young narrator as appealing as Alice and her telling of this story makes this dark comedy a pure joy to read.	2001-09-11

Truthfully, my own opinion lies somewhere in the middle. This was my first Anita Shreve novel and I was disenchanted by her unsympathetic characters, disjointed writing, and annoying use of italics. On the other hand, I did enjoy the story of first love, true love. If everyone has a soul mate, then surely Thomas Janes was that to Linda Fallon and vice versa. Perhaps no love is quite like that first great love that totally engulfs you and colors all your relationships after that. Linda and Thomas seemed to be proof that marriage to others, bearing children with another, and enjoying a highly successful career could not diminish the love they shared in high school. They both knew their love was one that would fill a lifetime with joy and devotion. Perhaps the best thing I can say about this novel is that Anita Shreve did a masterful job of building suspense to reach the chilling and shocking conclusion. Only because she had aroused my curiosity could I muddle through this often boring story to find out what happened to Linda and Thomas. Would they be together again? Would their horrible secret from high school ever be revealed? And what exactly did Thomas do at the writers convention in Toronto that set tongues wagging? It was often hard to follow them as the writer took us backwards in time, but I was glad I stayed around for the last page and the split second that changed everything.	2001-08-30

As memories of past events flash through her mind, she and and her husband chase a trail of clues involving letters from abroad, a retired doctor, a former housemaid, a jilted boyfriend, and a mysteriously torn tennis net.  Miss Marple is at the peak of her powers as she helps the couple unravel the clues and see clearly what is right before them.  &quot;It really is very dangerous to believe people, &quot; she informs them.  &quot;I never have for years.&quot;  But you can believe that when Miss Marple is present, the plot is thick with excitement, red herrings, and her uncanny ability to read human nature.  Perhaps the best of the Miss Marple series, this is a fitting farewell to Christie's universally beloved spinster.<br />In 1987, an excellent adaptation of this novel was filmed for TV with Joan Hickson portraying Jane Marple.	2001-08-16

A murder will be committed, the famous detective tells his friend, and Hastings must function as Poirot's legs. Aging and failing in health, the once energetic Poirot is now confined to a wheelchair. However, that does not stop the two friends from once again going on the hunt together in a case Poirot himself tells Hastings will be his last case but his most interesting one. As a special bonus for Poirot fans, we return once again to Styles, the scene of Poirot's first adventure. A near-death of one woman followed by the actual death of another, a sadist who is able to convince others to murder, a most surprising act by Hastings himself, a peep through a keyhole, a visit to a faithful valet, and murder most symmetrical are clues that lead to the uncovering of the criminal Poirot has come to Styles to unmask.  Surely, this must rank as one of Christie's finest as we bid a fond adieu to Hercule Poirot.  We shall not hunt together again, my friend.	2001-08-12

One day they were in the post office and she just keeled over.  It turned out she had a brain tumor and lived only two more years, but instead of being sad they said each day how lucky they were to see the sun rise, to share a walk on the beach, etc. After Jane's death, he knew that he would one day write a book for all those who have loved and lost and learned to love again.  This book is not only an outstanding tribute to his love for Jane, but one of the most engrossing page-turners I have come across.  I started it yesterday afternoon and literally could not stop until I finished.  Finally, in the wee hours of the morning, I closed the book and cried uncontrollably.  I knew it was going to be sad, but a most unexpected shocker near the end left me stunned.<br />Everyone who reads this book will come away with not only a great story, but a great piece of advice about five balls that we must all balance in life.<br />The story of Matt, his wife Suzanne, his son Nicholas, and the diary he leaves for Katie to read will literally break your heart.  Patterson writes with a genuine understanding of what love is and how it survives tragedy.  Just reading it will hopefully make each of us appreciate the gift each day is.  Happy Reading!	2001-07-30

Having it be a &quot;required&quot; read was also not encouraging.  However, about 100 pages into the story, I became captivated by the Joad family---particularly Tom, a man of great moral integrity, and the strong-willed but loving Ma Joad who provides the family's source of strength and courage in the face of overwhelming adversity.  While some parts may make you flinch in horror, others will make you sad to realize these events really happened in the land of plenty.<br />&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is an engrossing tale of one Oklahoma family seeking not their fame and fortune, but just the hope of putting a few scraps of food on the table.  Join them in their clunker of a truck as all 12 of them pile in to make the long and arduous drive west to California in the hopes of finding work picking fruit.  They lose family members along the way, some by death and some by choice, but they learn a lot about friendship and taking care of not only their loved ones but also the strangers who find themselves in the same dire straits as the Joads are in.  Steinbeck's descriptions of the hunger, the hardship, the futile search for work, the disappointments, the hostile environment the migrants faced in California,  all make for an eye-opening read. This is a great source of information on how it was for one group of people during the Depression.<br />It may not be one of the great novels of the twentieth century, its characters are often overly-sentimental, and its theme is relatively simple, but it is a landmark of literature for the way it portrays the Depression in the western United States. This book has been proven to be an accurate portrayal of the victims of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl.<br />Steinbeck alternates plot-driven chapters that feature the story of the Joads with chapters that focus on the large-scale problems of the economic history of California and the psychology of groups of migrants and of the landowners. These large-scale chapters provide background information and a broad world view that gives weight to the Joads' struggle, while the story of the Joads gives the large-scale chapters a sympathetic human face.<br />Whether you love or hate the book, you will probably never forget this story of one family's valiant fight to survive while the world around them collapses and disintegrates.<br />The novel was made into an excellent film in 1940 which starred a very young Henry Fonda as Tom Joad.and the psychology of groups of migrants and of the landowners.

Come join them, their quirky family members, eccentric friends, and even a few who crash the festivities.  The book covers just a few hours of one snow-bound night, from ceremony through reception, supper, dance, bouquet toss, and midnight toast. But you will get involved with the lives of many in this blue-collar wedding party as they reveal their background, their fears, hopes, and often odd behavior.<br />Shunning a traditional Catholic service, the wedding couple selects a notorious brothel and lodge for their wedding.  The jilted boyfriend, the hard-biting sister, the young brother feeling the pains of puberty, and a superstitious grandmother add spice to the event.  Counterbalancing the wedding story is the story of another couple who happen to bring their troubled relationship to the lodge.  With assistance from  a penny-pinching manager, a befuddled desk clerk, and children who should have never been seen or heard, the two stories intersect and you have a Valentine's Day to remember.<br />Reading this book is akin to being a fly-on-the-wall at a wedding where you know no one, but with the help of the cash bar can still enjoy the goings-on.  Sit back and enjoy the power of love, the commercialism of a well-planned wedding. Cheers!	2001-07-08

Each faces a life-changing situation that will cause her to utilize her strongest survival skills as she seeks to find happiness and satisfaction amongst the debris.<br />At the heart of this story is twenty-nine year old Daisy, the devoted mother of two young children and pregnant with her third child.  She devotes her days to making her young children happy, but her husband finds her growing frumpy and desserts her for a younger, professional woman unencumbered by diapers, formulas, and Captain Kangaroo.  Daisy's daily travails as she struggles with rejection, single-parenthood, and reduced income are brutally true-to-life for anyone who has been there, done that.  And her troubles, like a stone thrown into a river, cause ripples in the lives of her mother and her younger sister.<br />Her mother, Margaret, is approaching 50 and wants to enjoy the freedom of an empty nest.  After a lifetime of being the perfect cookie-baking, nose-wiping mother, she walks out of her seemingly-happy marriage to seek her own identity.  She is eager to grasp glamour and the pleasures of a self-centered life as opposed to being everyone's shoulder to cry on as she has always been.<br />Daisy's younger sister, twenty-four year old Dale, is feeling the joy of first love with its intense longing and lust accompanied by her deep-seated fear of what happens when love ends.<br />Each woman must take the plunge into unchartered waters and find a way to live that will be rewarding.  Nancy Thayer writes with such frankness and honesty that you will stand up and cheer at some parts and be ready to throw dishes at the wall in other parts.  But most of all, you will be touched by three women who take life as it comes with its unexpected slaps in the face and its unasked for detours.  Will they succeed?  Watch them as they live each mind-boggling day and decide individually what makes a life really worth living.ng.	2001-07-08

The horror of this tale comes not from the deed itself, but by its steadily being uncovered by Mr. Utterson, the respectable Victorian lawyer. Utterson's friend, Dr. Henry Jekyll, was also a respected Victorian man of a hard-working and decent nature.  He maintained a respectable persona in public while hiding his indecent, baser impulses.  Jekyll was troubled by the dual life he was leading, and so when his scientific interest led to mystical studies of the divided nature of man, he hoped to find a solution to his problem.  He dreamed of separating the good and evil natures within man and proving that &quot;man is not truly one, but truly two.&quot;<br />What follows is a step-by-step account of how his friend Utterson discovers the relationship between Jekyll and Hyde.  The reader is privvy to the torment of Dr. Jekyll, particularly in the final climactic chapter in which Dr. Jekyll in a letter to his friend explains all that has gone before.  This is not a horror story, as some movie versions have implied, but a psychological study of man's dual nature and the relationship between civilized man and uncivilized man.<br />Robert Louis Stevenson did a masterful job of building the tension and excitement and laying the groundwork for the final chapter, skillfully recounted in Dr. Jekyll's own words.	2001-06-25

Alistair Ravenscroft and his wife Margaret were found shot to death near their home.  The deaths were declared suicides at the time.  Now, years later, their daughter Celia is engaged to be married.  Her future mother-in-law wants to know more about the cirumstances of the death and if the wife killed the husband or the husband killed the wife. She does not want some inherited proclivity to murder to affect her son.  Celia turns to her godmother, Ariadne Oliver, who once again enlists the help of her old friend Hercule Poirot.  Together they track down a list of &quot;elephants,&quot; people with long memories who never forget past events.  The officer who had been in charge of the case, a wig stylist, two French governesses, and a family friend each remember some piece of information that Poirot can collect and assemble as he uncovers secrets long buried and brings the truth to light.<br />This is Mrs. Oliver's final appearance in a Christie novel and also the last Poirot book Agatha Christie wrote, although readers will see him again in &quot;Curtain&quot; which she wrote during the 1940's but was not published until 1975.	2001-06-16

Tuppence is sorting them out and reading through one of them when she discovers underlined letters and a child's simple cipher.  Naturally, Tuppence decodes the message which reads &quot;Mary Jordan did not die naturally.  It was one of us.&quot; The naturally inquisitive Tuppence is once again off to discover who Mary Jordan is, when she lived in the village, and how she really died.<br />Though this book has been criticized quite strongly by many readers, I found it to be another most enjoyable brain-teaser from Agatha Christie.  It was also very satisfying to see how Tommy and Tuppence lived out their adventurous lives.  Thank you, Mrs. Christie, for giving us closure to this exciting couple.	2001-06-16

While I prefer her works set in the cozy country estates with families full of suspects, this is an enjoyable foray into this type of her work. Tones of neo-Nazism, drug trafficking, international finance, and a scientific discovery that could change the world are some of the elements that make up this story.<br />The characters are interesting:  Sir Stafford Nye, an unambitious member of the British diplomatic corps caught up in this caper; his great-aunt Matilda, an aristocratic lady reminiscent of Miss Marple in that she has a remarkable memory of things that happened long ago; a young girl with three identities who fears for her life, and a young man rumored to be the son of Adolph Hitler are among the characters that come to life in this novel.<br />If you like international intrigue, stories about spies and world domination, I think you will enjoy this book.	2001-06-16

When Mr. Rafiel grows too ill to set a terible injustice right, he leaves that duty to Miss Marple in his will along with a bequest of twenty thousand pounds.  Miss Marple agrees to do what she can but is puzzled since she is given no information.  Knowing Mr. Rafiel as she does, however, she knows he will guide her if only from the grave.  And guide he does.  A few days after agreeing to do his biding, she receives a letter from the Famous Homes and Gardens of Great Britain confirming her reservation on one of their tours as a gift from Mr. Rafiel.  Realizing this is the lead she was waiting for, she sets out on the tour relying only on her own keen observations and the belief that Mr. Rafiel will give her more assistance along the way.  That he does, as she is led through a maze of adventure and danger to solve mysteries both old and new.<br />Most interesting among the characters in this book are three elderly sisters who own a beautiful 18th century house.  Because they had received a letter from their friend Jason Rafiel informing them that his friend Jane Marple would be on the tour, they invite her to be their guest while she is in Jocelyn St. Mary.  Just as in &quot;A Caribbean Mystery&quot; Mr. Rafiel proves to be a worthy ally and Jane Marple more than lives up to his opinion of her and proves herself worthy of the pet name &quot;Nemesis&quot; he had bestowed on her.	2001-06-16

Chief Inspector Davy is the detective in this one and he welcomes Miss Marple's keen acumen.  We are introduced to an assortment of English ladies and gentlemen staying at the hotel which serves as a gathering place for suspects much as the country estates did in Christie's earlier works.<br />Although this is slower than many of her other works and has a rather complicated conclusion, it is a good look at the changing times in English society and another wonderful visit with Miss Marple.	2001-06-15

He stops short when four other guests approach, any of whom may have heard the conversation.  A chambermaid telling tales and two murders are pivotal in this mystery that Miss Marple solves with her usual shrewd detection skills.

Poirot amongst the swinging Bohemians?  Well, it happens.  Christie and Poirot both changed with the times and the result is interesting, although probably not her best work.<br />The term &quot;third girl&quot; refers to a way of leasing flats, very similar to the term &quot;roommates&quot; in the US.  One girl rents a flat, then advertises for a second and third girl to share accommodations and expenses.<br />Ariadne Oliver once more assists Poirot in this tale of impersonation, drugs, smuggling, forgery, blackmail, and a young girl who can't remember committing a murder.<br />This is a great commentary on English life in the sixties and, as always, excellent plotting and character development in the Christie tradition.	2001-06-15

It all begins with a visit to the Sunny Ridge nursing home to call on Tommy's elderly Aunt Ada.  While there, Tuppence meets another guest, a Mrs. Lancaster, who startles Tuppence by asking &quot;Was it your poor child?&quot;  Mrs. Lancaster is apparently referring to the body of a child concealed behind a fireplace.  A few weeks later Aunt Ada dies and when Tommy and Tuppence go to collect her things, they discover that Mrs. Lancaster has given Ada a painting of a pink house by a canal that is hauntingly familiar to Tuppence. Mrs. Lancaster has also been mysteriously whisked away from the nursing home by relatives who left no forwarding address.<br />A rowboat added to the painting by someone other than the artist, a nursing home murder, a grave with no body, and a letter in a secret compartment are some of the clues that lead to the uncovering of crimes both old and new.<br />This is on-the-edge-of-your-seat excitement from a master storyteller and you probably will want to read it all in one sitting.

Calgary had been struck by a lorry the morning after giving Jack a ride, suffered a severe case of amnesia, and left immediately to join the expedition without knowing of the murder or of the fact that he alone could provide an alibi.<br />Although it is too late to change things, Calgary feels it necessary to tell the family his story.  The family is less than receptive because this new revelation means the real murderer is still at large and could be one of them.

For reasons unknown, his coat contains a pocket full of rye.  The queen in the parlour who was eating bread and honey is his young second wife, rumored to have married him for his money.  Although she is the first suspect, her murder the following afternoon after a tea of scones and honey, shifts suspicion.  That same afternoon, the housemaid Glady Martin is also found dead.

Not since Daphne DuMaurier penned Rebecca have I read such a strong, enticing opening.  Coincidentally, the heroine of this story is named Rebecca.  Like many middle-aged women, she reaches a point where she wonders what happened to that intelligent, inquisitive 18-year old and how she evolved into the family planner and consoler, a grandmother who  dresses like a bag lady.<br />Anne Tyler keeps her brilliant humor with this one as she gives us quirky, slightly offbeat characters surrounded by chaos, trying to make it while sliding downhill all the time.  This work is all about the choices we make and the big &quot;What IFS.&quot;<br />In the midst of one typically chaotic moment, while trying to cheer up an unhappy, grumbling family during a picnic, a perpetually jolly Rebecca is shocked to realize what a clean, simple life she would have led of it weren't for love.  Nothing in the much-extended and offbeat Davitch family ever &quot;flows&quot; and it is always Rebecca at the epicenter of all crises.  Apparently, she learns, you grow to love whomever you're handed whether it's a 99-year old man on his way to the hospital or a daughter who drops husband after husband, always after having given birth to a child.<br />Tyler gives us a look into the everyday events in life that are fraught with laughter (but only to an outsider or years later in retrospect.)  Her meeting with her former fiance, the dinner with his multi-pierced daughter, the 100th birthday party she hosts for her uncle-in-law, and her attempt at an elegant dinner party while two gardeners discuss their mating habits outside an open window are just some of the laugh-out-loud funny moments that fill this book.<br />It is Rebecca's long-put-on-hold study of Robert E. Lee that leads her to the realization there are no grander motivations than family and friends and your true life is the one you end up with, whatever it may be. Rebecca finally sees herself on a family video and realizes she really had been having a wonderful time.  And you will, too, as you share her middle-aged crisis with her.

Carrie Louise's sister, Ruth Van Rydock, has asked Miss Marple to visit Carrie Louise and determine what the trouble is and to alleviate her worries about her sister.<br />Agatha Christie once again takes us into a family estate overrun with family members.  This family is particularly complex because Carrie Louise has been married three times and there is a wide assortment of relatives including stepsons, a widowed daughter, grandchildren, and even a current husband.  The husband is deeply involved with corrective training and has turned the family home into a school where first offenders come for counseling and attention.  So to this already strained situation, Mrs. Christie includes psychologists and therapists and a situation ripe for murder.<br />Indeed, three murders occur and there is much unpleasantness before Miss Marple explains it all.<br />This story (also published under the title &quot;Murder With Mirrors&quot;) was adapted for TV in 1991 with Joan Hickson in the role of Miss Marple and Jean Simmons as Carrie Louise.	2001-05-22

The combination gets her in endless trouble.<br />The story begins when she meets an attractive young man named Edward in FitzJames Gardens one afternoon.  They have an immediate bonding, but Edward is scheduled to leave very soon for Baghdad in connection with his job with a cultural arts group called The Olive Branch.  Not one to be easily discouraged, Victoria sets about finding a position that will allow her to follow Edward to Baghdad.  Her search for him in this colorful city involves her with many suspicious characters, a badly wounded man who dies in her hotel room, and a great look at an archaeological dig, a particular specialty of Mrs. Christie's.<br />It is all wildly incredible, definitely improbable, but still an entertaining work with many likeable and well-drawn characters.	2001-05-22

The motive appears to be robbery as her small cache of savings is found hidden near her cottage and her blood and hair are found on Bentley's coat.  But Superintendent Spence(whom we met in Taken At The Flood) suspects something is not quite right and calls in Hercule Poirot to investigate this crime.<br />Poirot is most unhappy at the Summerhayes family home where Mrs. McGinty had been the domestic help.  Without Mrs. McGinty the home is a disaster, and Poirot's love of order, method, and delicious food suffers greatly.  Poirot persists in his investigation, however, and discovers an old newspaper with cut-out pages.  The discovery of the missing article leads him to investigate the homes Mrs. McGinty cleaned, and he finds guilty secrets in each one.  With the help of Ariadne Oliver who adds much comic relief, Poirot finds the person with a shameful past who feared exposure by Mrs. McGinty.<br />In 1964 this novel was adapted to the big screen.  Poirot was replaced by Miss Marple (Margaret Rutherford) in the screen version known as &quot;Murder Most Foul.&quot;  The substitution is understandable since Miss Marple is the noted authority on village crime, but the result was less than pleasing.  The plot was changed to such an incredible degree that there is very little resemblance to Christie's outstanding novel.	2001-05-22

He has amassed a fortune in business and has always maintained that his money also belongs to his family.  Although they are also successful, the other family members have come to depend on Gordon and the security he and his fortune offer.<br />And now for the fly in the ointment:  Gordon meets Rosaleen, a young Irish widow, on an Atlantic crossing and their shipboard romance leads to a quick marriage.  Before he can bring her home to his family, Gordon is killed during a bombing raid.  Because he has not changed his will, his entire fortune passes to Rosaleen.  She and her brother go to live in his family home and, needless to say, are the target of much resentment by the family.<br />The alternate title of this book is &quot;There Is A Tide&quot; and both titles come from the line in Julius Caesar which says &quot; There is a tide in the affairs of men when, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.&quot;  Fortune is definitely the key to this novel and the lengths to which men and women will go to obtain one.<br />This is vintage Christie as she proves once more that murder is always exciting when it's kept all in the family.	2001-05-16

She is living in a woman's world where everyone including her hardnosed and uncompromising daughter Joanna, her sadly vulnerable granddaughter Harriet, and her delightfully wicked mother-in-law Cicely seems dependent on her.<br />What do you do when your life falls apart, Joanna asks her mom at one point.  You pick up the pieces, Kate replies, and if the most important bit is missing you pick up what's left, reshape it, and make something new of it, like a patchwork quilt.  And the reshaping of Kate's life is what this irresistible novel involving four generations of women is about.  Kate first discovers her needlework skills can lead to a profitable business and then discovers that the handsome new millionaire in town is the love of her life.<br />This is a wonderful tale of a woman who was stronger than she ever realized, and of how she overcomes self-doubt and low self-esteem to become the woman she was destined to be.<br />Adding spice to this cozy English tale is a long-held secret involving paternity, a strained marriage on the brink of divorce, a car accident victim in America, and a teenager who shaves her head for attention. But it is the flawless writing of Mary Sheepshanks, her witty dialogue and wonderful characterizations, that will keep you reading to the satisfying conclusion.	2001-05-13

It might seem an unusual step for a writer who specialized in 20th century murder set in cozy English villages, but all the passions that lead to murder---jealousy, envy, greed, love, hate---are apparently timeless.  Christie's research was painstaking and she is able to give us the exact details of this ancient life down to the type of food they ate and the type of clothes they wore.  One of the most amazing things to me was that she was able to make these characters so realistic even though they are living in a time and under circumstances so foreign to the reader.<br />  The plot centers on multiple murders involving members of the family of Imhotep, a well-to-do religious leader in Thebes around 2000 BC.<br />This novel is her most unique, but it has the same brilliant plotting and satisfying ending that all her others have.	2001-05-10

She returns to the classic &quot;young woman in jeopardy&quot; theme she is famous for and surrounds heroine Emily Graham with a cast of well-defined characters, each with motive and opportunity to be a serial killer.<br />In a recent television interview, MHC mentioned she had just purchased a home in Spring Lake, NJ, the setting of this novel.  The previous owner had been a Mrs. Eleanor Higgins and the fact that her own complete name is Mary Theresa Eleanor Higgins was not lost on the intrepid queen of suspense.  The idea for this novel was conceived and the heroine of the novel purchases a home that had been in her family 110 years ago when a serial killer took the lives of three young Spring Lake girls.  Is history repeating itself when a new string of killings occurs or is there such a thing as reincarnation of an obsessed killer?<br />Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this novel is that MHC takes us into the mind of the killer.  Without knowing his identity, the reader knows his moves, his plans, his mindset.  But the looming question is who is this obsessed man?  Is it Gary White, the greedy ex-husband?  Will Stafford, the handsome real estate agent and Emily's frequent dinner partner?  Ned Koehler, a man convicted of stalking Emily at her previous residence in Albany?  Eric Bailey, the meek but intelligent owner of a dot-com company? Clayton Wilcox, the retired college professor who is being blackmailed? Nick Todd, the defense lawyer tired of getting guilty clients off?  Or Bob Frieze, the restaurant owner prone to blackouts when he can't remember his actions for hours at a stretch?<br />Into this rich blend of characters, Mrs. Higgins adds a look at life in this upscale resort community and a touch of budding romance.<br />The suspects are many, but the ending is classic and chilling in the Mary Higgins Clark tradition.  Definitely one to keep you up all night finishing.finishing.	2001-05-08

Not only do we have an outstanding detective story complete with murder, motives, opportunities, red herrings, and numerous suspects, but we also have Christie probing the mind of a psychopathic killer.  She has done this in other works, but never so brilliantly as she does it in &quot;Towards Zero.&quot;<br />The setting is the lovely seaside estate of Lady Tressilian, a widow with  no close relatives.  However, several distant relations often visit her and our killer has chosen just such an occasion when there will be a houseparty as his &quot;zero hour.&quot;<br />Audrey Strange is an especially memorable character from this novel as is her ex-husband Nevile, a well-known tennis star who is visiting with his current wife Kay.  Other characters include: Mary Aldin, companion/secretary to Lady Tressilian ; Thomas Royde, an old friend home on leave; Ted Latimer, a friend of Kay's before her marriage to Nevile, and Superintendent Battle who returns for his finest appearance of all the five Christie novels he is in.<br />A young girl's trouble at school, a failed suicide attempt, and a tragic automobile accident from the past all figure prominently in this excellent story with an unforgettable and chilling ending.	2001-05-07

The victim was Rosemary Barton who died the year before the story begins.  She was celebrating her birthday with husband and friends at a fashionable restaurant when she apparently took her own life.  Because no one present had any desire to kill her and cyanide was found in the depressed woman's purse, suicide was accepted as the cause of death.  Nine months later, her husband George begins receiving anonymous letters saying the death was not what it appeared.  These hints of murder lead George to suspect that one guest at the dinner party did indeed kill his wife.  The killer strikes again a year later when an almost identical party is held at the same restaurant to celebrate the birthday of Rosemary's younger sister Iris.<br />Who was the beautiful heiress Rosemary Barton?  Through the words of each of the characters, the reader gets various versions of Rosemary---her personality, her lovers, her love affairs, her marriage, her death.<br />Once again, Christie gives us memorable characters:  Iris, the younger sister who failed to inherit but would receive all on Rosemary's death; George, the husband who just might be resenting her philandering ways; Ruth Lessing, George's faithful secretary; Anthony Browne, her gentleman friend with a notorious past; Stephen Faraday, one of her lovers; and Sandra Faraday, Stephen's wife.<br />Colonel Race, a recurring character in Christie novels, appears in this one as a family friend of the Bartons who is called in by George to find the killer.<br />In 1983 this novel was adapted to television.  Unfortunately, by moving the setting from England to California and updating the plot, much of Christie's excellent novel suffered.	2001-05-07

While on holiday at the Jolly Roger Hotel on England's South Coast, she openly cavorts with Patrick Redfern while her husband and his wife watch helplessly.  Tragedy is inevitable and few are surprised when Arlena is murdered.<br />What sets Christie apart from other mystery writers is the wonderful skill she exhibits with characterizations.  This novel, one of her best in my opinion, is complete with many well-developed ones which make for a believable crime.  Miss Rosamund Darnley, a talented dress designer, and Mr. and Mrs. Odell Gardener, the outspoken American woman and her long-suffering husband, are just a few of the many who fill this story.  And of course, the famous detective Hercule Poirot also happens to be on holiday here at the time of the murder. Everybody is a suspect as voodoo practices, drug-smuggling, religious mania, and two murders from the past add intrigue.<br />The book was adapted to the big screen in 1982 with Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot, Dianna Rigg as Arlena Marshall, and Maggie Smith, Roddy McDowall, James Mason, Colin Blakely, and Jane Birkin also starring. A new made-for-tv version will air in 2001 with David Suchet as Poirot and Hugh Fraser as Arthur Hastings.	2001-05-04

Her dear friends, Col. and Mrs. Bantry, have the unpleasant experience of having the body of a rather cheap-looking blonde found in their library.  The unidentified corpse does not appear to be at all the type of person the Bantrys would associate with, and tongues begin wagging in the village.  The search to identify the body involves many interesting characters:  Ruby Keene, a professional dancer who has been reported missing; Josephine Turner, her cousin; Raymond Starr, exhibition dancer and tennis pro; and Conway Jefferson, a man confined to a wheelchair as the result of an accident that killed his wife and children.  Mr. Jefferson was rumored to have been quite taken with the exotic Ruby.  Add to this mix the Bantrys next door neighbor, Basil Blake, who is a &quot;party animal&quot; and been known to consort with film stars and others of loose reputations, according to the gossip-mongers in the village.<br />The professional detectives are baffled and it is our shy and quiet Miss Marple who solves the case because of her past experiences and observations of how people act, particularly young girls.	2001-05-04

In this case, Elinor Carlisle is the odd girl out as her fiance and distant cousin Roderick Welman falls madly in love with his and Elinor's childhood friend, Mary Gerrard, after Mary returns from years abroad.  The three of them had been great friends at Hunterbury, the lavish estate of Mary's aunt Mrs. Laura Welman.  Mrs. Welman had hoped Elinor and Roderick would marry one day and live at Hunterbury.  Mrs. Welman dies suddenly without leaving a will.  As her next of kin, Elinor inherits all.  Although Mrs. Welman had spoken frequently of providing for Roderick and Mary, the lack of a will leaves them without recourse.  In the midst of all this upheaval, Elinor prepares lunch for Mary one day, and Mary dies of morphine poisoning.  With suspicion falling heavily on Elinor, the body of Mrs. Welman is exhumed and found to also contain morphine poisoning.  All fingers point to Elinor for having killed Mary out of jealousy and her aunt in order to get the full estate.  Only one person, Dr. Peter Lord, believes in Elinor's innocence and he calls in the inimitable Hercule Poirot to investigate.<br />An excellent courtroom sequence and outstanding characters make this one of Christie's best, in my opinion.	2001-05-01

What makes &quot;Appointment With Death&quot; stand out is that Christie does a psychological study on an entire family.  The emotionally unbalanced Boyntons consist of the cruelly sadistic Mrs. Boynton, the near-schizophrenic daughter Ginevra, stepchildren Raymond and Carol who are eager to escape the confines of their stepmother, an older stepson Lennox and his wife Nadine who remains alone in being undisturbed by the influence of the terrible matriarch.<br />The setting for this mystery is exotic Jerusalem where the Boyntons have come on holiday to visit the Holy Land.  Christie excels in providing local color and this novel ranks among her best in that area.<br />Perhaps no reader will be shocked that Mrs. Boynton is murdered or that Hercule Poirot just happens to be on holiday in the same area and agrees to assist the local police in solving the crime.  What will be intriguing is the long list of suspects, motives, and opportunities.  Also, in typical Christie fashion, will be a surprising twist that leaves the reader saying &quot;Now why didn't I see that coming?&quot;  A great read filled with red herrings and the type of descriptive writing that Agatha Christie excels in.<br />This book became popular with the release of the 1988 movie starring Peter Ustinov as Poirot and Lauren Bacall as Mrs. Boynton.  Also in the cast were Carrie Fisher, David Soul, John Gielgud, Hayley Mills, and Piper Laurie.	2001-04-30

When Jacqueline becomes engaged to Simon Doyle, she convinces her friend Linnet to hire him as her estate agent.  Only tragedy can ensue when Linnet and Simon fall madly in love and Simon marries Linnet, not Jacqueline.  The jilted Jacqueline shows up at every stop on Linnet and Simon's honeymoon, but on the last leg of the trip, a cruise down the Nile, Linnet's patience has worn thin.<br />Added to this intriguing scenario are a cast of interesting cruisemates including Hercule Poirot who is taking a well-deserved holiday and Colonel Race who has appeared in earlier Christie works.  Also on board are an anxious American lawyer with questionable financial dealings, a British solicitor, a mother traveling with her grown daughter, and another mother traveling with her grown son.  These and others make this sailing of the Karnak one you don't want to miss.<br />This novel was brought to the big screen in 1978 with Peter Ustinov as Poirot, David Niven as Colonel Race,  Mia Farrow as Jacqueline, and Lois Chiles as Linnet.

He invites to dinner four detectives plus four people he suspects may have gotten away with murder.<br />Along with Poirot are two detectives we have met in earlier Christie works:  Colonel Race, the trouble-shooter from the Foreign Office, and Superintendent Battle of Scotland Yard.  Introduced in this book is Mrs. Ariadne Oliver, a best-selling mystery writer, who has been compared to Christie herself.  Like Mrs. Christie, Mrs. Oliver eats large quantities of apples while writing and Mrs. Oliver's books are about a quirky Finn who is not unlike Mrs. Christie's quirky Belgian. Mrs. Oliver will return in six additional novels.<br />The other four guests that evening are:  Dr. Roberts, a successful physician; Mrs. Lorrimer, an affluent widow who loves to play bridge; Major Despard, an African and South American explorer and guide; and Miss Anne Meredith, a young lady Shaitana met in Switzerland.<br />After dinner, a game of bridge is arranged.  Shaitana directs the four detectives to one room while the other four guests play in a separate room.  The host says he does not like the game so sits and dozes by the fire in the room where the four possible murderers are playing.  When the guests prepare to leave later, it is discovered that Shaitana has been fatally stabbed at some point in the evening.<br />All four detectives tackle this case in their own way.  Bridge players will delight in the way Poirot handles the case.  He concentrates on the game itself, the hands that were dealt, and the method of scoring.  If you pay attention to the game, you just might guess the murderer.<br />This is one of Christie's classic surprise endings and, in my opinion, one of her best works.	2001-04-27

She asks Poirot to intercede for her with her husband and get him to agree to the divorce.  When Poirot meets with Lord Edgware he finds the baron very agreeable and says he has informed his wife of this previously in a letter. Jane insists she never received the letter, but is thrilled at the news.<br />A problem arises when Lord Edgware is killed that very evening and several witnesses testify that Jane was present at the home at the time of the murder.  Twelve other reliable witnesses can attest to the fact that she was with them at a dinner party that evening and could not possibly have killed her husband.<br />Add to this plot a visiting American actress who does impersonations, a letter with a torn page, a pair of pince-nez, a chance remark by two strangers, a luncheon conversation about Paris, and Poirot solves the case in brilliant form proving his genius and why Agatha Christie is the undisputed mistress of mystery	2001-04-26

The entertainment for the day is a seance which suggests that Captain Trevelyan, owner of the house, may be dead.  The Captain has leased his home to a Mrs. Willett and her daughter Violet.  These South African women had been so insistent on spending a typical British winter in the home that they convinced Trevelyan to move into a smaller home in nearby Exhampton. Major Burnaby, a friend of Trevelyan's, is present at the seance.  Although he does not believe in spiritualism, he decides to check up on his friend and finds that Trevelyan has been murdered.<br />From this intriguing beginning the story moves to Trevelyan's sister, two nephews, and niece, all of whom had motive and opportunity to commit the crime. Also, a convict has escaped from a nearby prison and is added to the list of suspects along with the mysterious Willetts.<br />Christie weaves the murder beautifully into the novel's second plot which is the unexplained presence of the Willetts in Sittaford.

Therefore, the list of suspects is much longer than usual.

He encounters four different people and groups of people who are all after the Heart of Fire, a spectacular ruby purchased by American tycoon Rufus Van Aldin and presented to his daughter Ruth.  Ruth is unhappily married to British aristocrat Derek Kettering, a richly layered character about whom the reader is still trying to decide if he is hero or villain up to the final chapter.  This novel is filled with exciting characters:  Mirelle, the exotic dancer with a passion for Derek; Armand de la Roche, the attractive but notorious swindler; and most refreshing of all is Katherine Grey, one of Mrs. Christie's best heroines.<br />When Ruth Van Aldin Kettering is found murdered on the Blue Train en route to her annual winter trip to the French Riviera, it is up to Hercule Poirot to discover if she was murdered because the famous jewel was in her possession or was she murdered by her husband or his mistress or was there yet another sinister motive.<br />This excellent tours de force is a landmark book for Christie fans because from this point until sometime in the late 60's every novel she published was brilliantly plotted and never failed to challenge the mystery reader.<br />Agatha Christie was known for experimenting with plots in short stories before developing them more fully in novels.  The Mystery of the Blue Train is a prime example of this, so you might wish to go back and read her earlier short story &quot;The Mystery of the Plymouth Express&quot; if you enjoyed this one.	2001-04-21

That's how the Cazalets affected me.  From the opening scene when the maids rise early to prepare their morning tea until the closing page when the children's schoolteacher buries her long-held secret, this family draws you into their upper class English home.<br />The story begins in 1937 England as the family, already touched deeply by WWI, prepares for the coming of WWII.  The doddering patriarch (affectionately called &quot;Brig&quot;) and the matriarch (always referred to as &quot;Duchy&quot;) gather their children and extended family at the summer home in Sussex to escape the dangers of London.  Hugh, the eldest son, has lost his hand in the previous war, but is making a good life with his wife Sybil and their children; Edward, the middle son, loves his wife Villy but has a mistress and a horrifying secret that threatens one of his children; the younger son, Rupert, has lost his first wife in childbirth and has remarried a much younger, beautiful airhead.  The lone sister cares for her aging parents while keeping secret a forbidden romance.<br />What is most amazing about this book is the way the author is able to capture each of the three generations so beautifully.  Most appealing are the descriptions and dialogue she gives the children.  There are 12 of them, and each one more appealing, more endearing, and more precocious than the next.<br />This is a wonderful look at how the English people prepared for WWII and the effects war had on them, particularly the children.  It is a comfortable, engrossing book filled with characters you'll love and some you'll despise.  Prepare to laugh out loud in some parts and shed a tear in other parts.

Their first case involves tracing a young girl, Jane Finn, who disappeared during the war with a folder of important government papers.  This is also Mrs. Christie's first of many novels to use the &quot;master criminal&quot; plot, a device she will use many more times in her writing career.

The time is World War I and Poirot is one of a small group of Belgian refugees who has come to live in a rural English village.  With his egg-shaped head and his well-groomed moustache, Poirot enters and soon becomes one of fiction's best-loved detectives.  Also in this novel, the reader is introduced to his cohort, Captain Arthur Hastings, recovering from a war injury at the upper-class household known as Styles Court.  The mistress of the manor is Emily Inglethorpe, an elderly woman who has just married a much younger man.  The family members occupying the house all become suspects when Mrs. Inglethorpe is murdered and it is up to Poirot's little grey cells to sift through all the red herrings and, in the final chapter, reveal all in true detective fashion. High on Poirot's list of suspects are:  John Cavendish, the elder stepson; Mary Cavendish, his wife; Lawrence Cavendish, the younger stepson; Evelyn Howard, Mrs. Inglethorpe's companion; Cynthia Murdoch, her protegee; and Dr. Bauerstein, a mysterious stranger who lives in Essex.  All have motive and opportunity but only Poirot can discover the truth.<br />This first novel sets the tone for many Christies to follow.  The wealthy family inhabiting a country house, the non-violent method of murder (poisoning) so favored by Mrs. Christie, and the light-hearted but often serious romance all became hallmarks of many of her later works.<br />Have a cup of hot chocolate with Poirot and enjoy the adventure.	2001-04-08

Dame Agatha wrote this during the 1940's, a period that critics agree was when she did her best work.  The crime in this book is the murder of the brilliant painter Amyas Crayle. His wife is convicted of the crime and sent to prison. However, their daughter is now of age and receives a letter from her mother professing her innocence.  The daughter turns to Hercule Poirot for help. If the wife is innocent, Poirot must look at the five people who were present at the time of the crime---hence, the five little pigs. And in true nursery rhyme fashion one little pig went to market (finanacial counsellor), one little pig stayed home (thanks to an inheritance), one little pig had roast beef (had made a good marriage), one little pig had none (retired teacher with limited income), and one little pig cried all the way home (the woman with a disfiguring facial scar).<br />One of the most interesting aspects of this book is that Poirot will get an account of the murder from each of the five characters.  At the end of these five accounts, you will have all the information that Poirot has and can try your hand at out-detecting the master.<br />This is a great detective story and one of the best by Agatha Christie.	2001-04-07

There's no angle.&quot;  Of course, the angle is that Marjorie Morningstar is every girl who ever dreamed a dream, who aspired to a great career, and wanted to marry the love of her life.  As a reader, I was caught up in her life when I first met her at age 17 till the book's closing when 39-year old Marjorie kisses life-long friend Wally goodbye.  I was thrilled to be a part of her life at her graduation from Hunter College, at the hysterically funny yet religiously insightful Seder, at the thrilling summer stock camp known as Southwind, and at every step of her tumultuous love affair with Noel Airman. From the heights of Central Park West to the seedy walk-up apartment in Paris, the reader is swept into Marjorie's life as she chases her dream to become not only a Broadway star but also Noel's wife.  Wouk has surrounded her with a remarkably well-drawn cast of supporting characters including her unforgettable Uncle Samson-Aaron, her sometimes friend Marsha, her loving but bewildered parents, and Mike Eden, the friend who forces her to look at her Jewish heritage.<br />Beginning in Central Park West in the 30's and ending in the post-war 50's, &quot;Marjorie Morningstar&quot; is a classic coming-of-age book filled with backstage drama, family clashes, and a love affair you will never forget.  You will be thoroughly engrossed in Marjorie's search for identity and her realization that the thing we often try hardest to avoid is that which we truly want most of all.	2001-03-29

A series of poison pen letters detailing the explicit and often illicit facts of the residents' lives is causing quite a stir.  The fear escalates when an apparent suicide is followed by a murder.  With so much wickedness abounding, the vicar's wife calls in her old friend Jane Marple, whom she considers an expert on wickedness in village life.<br />This book is notable for its excellent characterizations. From the community-minded doctor's sister, to the charming spinster who rents the Burtons her home, to the dazzling governess of the lawyer's young boys, Mrs. Christie gives us a village filled with quirky and interesting people.  Most notable is Megan Hunter, perhaps her finest young girl protagonist, who is transformed from the dowdy stepdaughter to an exquisite Cinderella.<br />The narrative style is light and entertaining, the romance sweet, and the murder quite deadly in this fun and always ingenuous offering from the mistress of mystery.<br />Mrs. Christie herself recalls this story in her autobiography as a personal favorite that has stood the test of time.  As charming as it no doubt was when first published in 1943, The Moving Finger is a most satisfying read.	2001-03-15

She wanted something to happen---something, anything; she didn't know what.  Being the pampered wife of a wealthy man, the mother of two sons, and the mistress of a New Orleans mansion, all left her unfulfilled.  Her &quot;awakening&quot; one fateful summer, her quest for independence and refusal to sacrifice her individual existence is the basis of this novel.  Her dalliances with other men, her friendships with women, and her ultimate fate made this a daring novel in 1899 and a startling reminder in 2001 of how far women have come.	2001-03-09

The artist and mother of nine children abandoned her beloved husband and eight surviving children forty years ago after the death of her favorite child.  Why she left has been shrouded in mystery, but when she writes her grandchildren and invites them to come meet with her and discuss her will, old secrets come to light.  The grandchildren, who are mostly estranged, begin to prepare for the trip and bond in interesting ways prior to their journey.  Proving that blood ties are the strongest of all, this suspenseful tale explores their lives and brings them together as, one by one, family members begin to be killed off.  Who could be performing these ghastly murders?  Odile herself?  The obnoxious oldest grandson who hopes to inherit all?  The distant relative whom all five granddaughters have a sexual relationship with?  There's lots of eerie suspense before Odile's secret and the murderer are revealed.  Good fun and murder aplenty---but as mentioned by another reviewer, a bit too many Annesleys.  Fortunately, Carol Smith has put the family tree at the front of the book, so be prepared to glance at it often while keeping all the brothers and sisters sorted in your mind.	2001-03-03

I particularly enjoyed trying Elvis' signature dish, the fried peanut butter and banana sandwich, as well as the banana pudding which was prepared daily at Graceland so it would always be available for late-night snacking.  Also getting high marks from me are the recipes for biscuits and red-eye gravy, potato cheese soup, heavenly mashed potatoes and more.  The book features great pictures of Elvis including one of he and Priscilla cutting the Royal Wedding Cake.  And yes, the recipe for that six-tiered mountain of a cake is included (serves 500 so do invite a friend over).  A delightful romp in the kitchen for fans of Elvis and a great cookbook for those who like down-home cooking.	2001-02-28

The play on words in the title becomes apparent halfway through the book as the truth of this mystery lies embedded in what is true in the Amish way of thinking, not necessarily what is right or true in our American judicial system.  Author Jodi Picoult gives us two very different women as main characters in this mystery/courtroom drama.  There is Katie, the young Amish girl who hides her out-of-wedlock pregnancy, gives birth in the barn to a baby later found dead, and stands trial for his murder. There is also Ellie, the burned-out Philadelphia lawyer who defends Katie. As fate would have it, thirty-nine-old Ellie would like nothing better than to have a baby.  Because of circumstances, Ellie must live on the Amish farm with Katie before and during the trial. Her &quot;baptism by fire&quot; is an accurate and engrossing look at the Amish life in Lancaster County, PA.  Add to the mix a cold-hearted father, a complacent mother, a shunned brother with a roommate who studies ghosts, Katie's Amish boyfriend who planned to marry her,  a former college sweetheart who happens to be a psychiatrist, and you have an absorbing mystery with motive, romance, and a somewhat-surprising if not disturbing ending.	2001-02-26

When a former lover reenters Virginia's life, their son Henry disappears from boarding school, and a pathetic madwoman begins to dredge up the past, there is plenty to worry about.  Add to the mix their good friends Archie and Isobel Balmerino, the lord and lady rich in titles but so short on cash they must open their family home to visiting American tourists.  Their daughter Lucilla, a free-spirit who has been traveling through Europe with her Austrailian boyfriend, returns home with a most surprising guest in tow---Archie's sister Pandora who left twenty years ago over whispered-about circumstances and whose return changes lives forever.<br />This is another trip into the world of Rosamunde Pilcher, one rich in family ties, unsurpassed local color of her beloved Scotland, and characters that will long be in your memory. If you're looking for an engrossing book to curl up with, one you will be hard-put to set aside, this is the book for you.	2001-02-11

Susan Toth's witty, conversational tone makes for an easy, enjoyable read.  But don't confuse it with a travel book.  This is instead a journal of Ms. Toth's many trips abroads from her adventurous back-packing with a friend at age 20 to the disastrous honeymoon with her first husband to her exploration of gorgeous gardens with her second husband. Reading this book is akin to traveling with a good friend and sharing likes and dislikes.<br />However, the England that Susan Toth really loves is the countryside and not the bustling London.  If London is your heart's desire, you might be better off with another choice.  Ms. Toth is not one to stand in line to view the Crown Jewels, but she will take you to memorable sheep dog shows or on a badger hunt.  My favorite chapters were those she did set in London and its environs when she was teaching a class abroad.  She definitely whetted my appetite for travel with her allusions to the places dear to Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Oscar Wilde and other literary figures.<br />This is a book to put you in the mood for England, a diary-like remembrance of her many trips to a country she loves.  But it alone won't help you plan a trip there.  For more on London proper for the book-lover, I would suggest &quot;Mystery Reader's Walking Guide:London&quot; by Alzina Stone Dale and Barbara Sloan Hendershott.	2001-02-06

Yet, for some unfathomable reason the reader is pulled into the homespun, humorous happenings of Father Tim and the parishioners of his Episcopal Church.  From next-door neighbor Cynthia who asks him to &quot;go steady&quot; to Homeless Hobbes who has known the glamour of Madison Avenue, you will find yourself inexplicably drawn into the everyday meanderings of this town.  Maybe everyone secretly wants to live the laid-back life in a town where the biggest news is a dog-napping, where a criminal in the attic becomes a favorite son, and where schizophrenics are coddled not institutionalized.  There is something safe and secure in a book where prayer is the key to solving all problems and favorite Bible verses roll off every character's tongue.  If a few sugar-coated hours appeal to you, read this book.  But if your tastes lean to the darker aspects of human nature, you need to look elsewhere.	2001-01-29

Nor will they be likely to forget Sophie, Lawrence, Danus, Antoinia, Richard, and the other characters that move through this spell-binding, heart-enriching novel.<br />Mrs. Pilcher sets out to explore the disastrous effects that the prospect of an inheritance can have on a normal family.  She also combines the lifestyle of upper-class Bohemians and the days before, during, and after World War II to tell a story that will be forever fresh.<br />From the beautiful beaches of Cornwall to the idyllic setting of Ibiza to the bustling life in London, Rosamunde Pilcher transports readers to a world as satisfying as a cup of tea with a plate of warm scones.<br />You will see Penelope grow up in the sheltering world of her artist father and young, French mother.  You will share her first love with Ambrose, her true love with Richard, her most wonderful joys and her deepest heartbreaks.  You will see her anguish with her three adult children as she struggles to give them independence and feels their venom.  You will see her come to terms with her life and her beloved painting of &quot;The Shell Seekers.&quot;<br />I first read this book several years ago and only yesterday finished a second reading of it.  I found it even more warm and heartfelt than ever.  I will make it a point to savor this most marvelous book every few years just for the pure joy it gives.	2001-01-20

Now, still in her 40's, Stan dies of cancer and her three grown children seem to want her to stop living and be a memorial to their father's memory.<br />But, Charlotte has other ideas. A long-ago, pre-Stan lover has haunted her.  Why did Cory Lee, the love of her life, not return to her when he came back from VietNam?  Charlotte decides to put an end to the fantasy and find Cory Lee.  She embarks on a journey in which she discovers a lot about herself.  Unfortunately, Charlotte has no one in her life who is sympathetic to her.  Her children are furious that she sells the family home, her sister is condescending, her mother is downright hateful.  It is only when Charlotte removes herself from the small-town she has lived in all her life that she feels she can truly be herself.<br />Judith Henry Wall has done an excellent job of defining many of the characters and places Charlotte in interesting situations.  However, Charlotte never seems to see herself as anything other than victim.  Will she find Cory Lee?  Will he change her life?  Will her children ever ease up on her?  Will her sister and mother ever offer her an ounce of support?  Read the book and decide if it's best to let sleeping dogs lie.	2001-01-09

The middle generation comes of age during WWII and illustrates the changing times.  One sister, Martha Claire, dreams of a happy home life and having babies  as she waits for her soldier/husband to return from Europe.  Meanwhile, her beloved and career-minded sister Justine joins the WACS and sees first-hand the horrors of war. The free-spirited Justine returns home unwed and pregnant and gives birth to Iris.  Martha Claire and her husband adopt Cissy and Buddy, orphan siblings, and they all live together in their happy, family home until a horrible secret shatters their world and drives them painfully apart.  The younger generation, devastated by what has happened to their once-loving family, struggles to learn the secret.  Only Cissy does and is able to bring some degree of healing to her destroyed family through her own troubles. You will never forget these mothers and daughters and will delight in their joys and cry over their heartbreaks.<br />This is the first novel I've ever read by this author, but I now intend to read all her work.

Spider's Web is a light, easy, and fun read that encompasses all the elements of an English houseparty.  The mansion complete with French doors for easy entrance by a murderer, the lovable hostess, the diverse houseguests, the professional detective, the required red herrings, the secret panel, and just for good measure, a sympathetic child---all combine for a delightful mystery. <br />Clarissa is the beloved mistress of the manor, and her self-proclaimed duty is to hide a body she finds in her parlor so that it won't interfere with her distinguished husband's entertaining a V.I.P. later in the evening.

In Tara Road she gives us Ria Lynch, an unforgettable character whom we can love, sympathize with, cry for, and cheer for. Her story is peppered with well-drawn minor characters who leave a lasting impression on the reader.

The choices they make, good and bad, are part of the tapestry of their lives, the ties that can destroy them or bind them.  When Michael says of his love &quot;I have found home,&quot; and Faye wrestles with how to heal herself emotionally, the reader will be drawn into their lives.  Evans' easy-going, conversational prose style is inviting and you will be glad you had a chance to share Michael and Faye's life with them.	2000-12-18

To say that the last 100 pages, in particular, will have you glued to this book is an understatement.<br />The chapters alternate between the voice of Colonel Behrani, an Iranian ousted with the Shah's regime, and Kathy Nicolo, a drug addict who has been desserted by her husband.  The reader is torn between the two who each have compelling reasons to claim ownership of the bungalow which the story centers around.<br />In Col. Behrani, we see the hardship of building a new life in a strange country.  He has fallen from the highest ranks in his native Iran to picking up garbage on the side of the road in California.  Kathy Nicolo, on the other hand, has left her sheltering family and seems to be at a loss to take control of her life.  If she'd only opened her mail from the County, this whole bizarre episode could have been avoided.  She is sympathetic in the first part of the book, but makes very poor choices which lead to the ultimate tragedy.  There is also Lester, the epitome of the bad cop hungry for power.  When he leaves his wife and children for Kathy, we can say that this is truly a match made in hell. They are co-dependents clinging to each other and bringing down the world with them.<br />The failure to work out the ownership of the house leads to senseless tragedy after tragedy.  The ending, however, had no uplifting message.  There was no ephiphany whereby our hero or heroine could rise from the ashes like a phoenix. We as readers are left with only a compounding of the tragedy which left me feeling the characters devastation and hopelessness.  If I could change one thing about this book, I would have some good come from this horrible chain of events.  As far as I could see, there was none.	2000-12-14

Being a lover of mysteries set at Christmas, I was totally captivated by her previous Christmas novella, &quot;All Through The Night.&quot;  This current one, while starting out on an interesting note (loved having Alvirah connect with Regan Reilly), falls flat quickly due to the lack of suspense.  Is there any reader who does not know from early into the book how this is going to turn out?  The suspense is virtually non-existent.  Also, Mary has gone to the kidnapping at Christmas plot once too often.  It worked so well in &quot;All Through the Night&quot; because the reader was caught up in the suspense of the helpless infant being the victim.  It's hard to muster the same level of concern for two adults who seem far wiser than their inept kidnappers. I've read all of MHC's books and this one goes on the bottom of my list when ranking favorites.  But I hope she does another Christmas one in 2001; just want her to be more imaginative and suspenseful.	2000-11-10

Many of the author's suggestions have become standard fare in our home---like rolling pine cones in peanut butter, sprinkling with bird seed which adheres to the peanut butter, and hanging them from trees as a nice treat for our feathered friends. You'll find hundreds of short suggestions for making your holiday bright and cheery--everything from baking Christmas cookies while a Johnny Mathis CD plays in the background to stirring your hot chocolate with a candy cane.

This book chronicles the letters they wrote over a period of many years to one another.  Although they never met, they became true friends bonded by their love of literature.<br />Having read this tiny little gem, I can tell you that I'm not even sure why I liked it so much.  Maybe it was because I loved seeing a warm friendship develop between two total strangers.  Maybe it was because I loved the dry wit of Helene and the staunch Britishness of Frank.  Maybe it was because I liked hearing about the WWII years, how the people of Britain sacrificed, and how one caring American woman made a difference to this small group of Britishers.<br />One note:  this is the only book I have ever read that is truly enhanced by the video.

I loved the images Helene evoked:  entering Claridge's for a fashionable lunch just like Noel Coward's characters; gawking at Elizabeth Barrett's home in Wimpole Street; thrilling at the sight of Dickens' home in Doughty Street; seeing a play at the Old Vic; watching the flag fly at Windsor Castle signalling the Queen is in residence; making a purchase at Harrod's , and so much more.  What a great book to read before flying across The Pond yourself.<br />Duchess chronicles the second part of Helene's story when she finally makes the trip of a lifetime and visits the England she has hungered for all her life.

Imagine my disappointment when I had to force myself to finish this book.<br />The characters were not likeable and I  could not care about them.  Only Hillary evoked any sympathy from me.  Gina  and Sophy and Lawrence  and Fergus all left me cold.  I cannot imagine a  group of more unlovable characters all assembled in one novel.  How could  anyone feel for the spoiled, self-centered, uncaring Gina?  And how did she  become this way?  She certainly did not grow up pampered and her mother Vi  seems to be a caring person. Lawrence came across as dim-witted and totally  controlled by his feeling-of-the-day.  Because I could not care about these  characters, I could not care about the repercussions of their adulterous  shenanigans and will not be inspired to read anything else by this author.	2000-06-11

Determined to forget the cold-hearted James Lacey, she rents a cottage in the village of Fryfam and immediately is swept up into the village life and  its mysterious happenings.  Charles Fraith joins her in this novel, and  although not as interesting as some of the others, it is definitely a must  for those who are following her adventures and love entanglements.  Some of  my favorites such as Mrs. Bloxby, Ron Silver, and James Lacey only make  cameo appearances in this one and I considered that a shortcoming.  Also,  the fact that one of the major mysteries is left unsolved was surprising to  me.<br />I felt the ending was too rushed.  We have been waiting for so long  for Agatha to get her man, and when she does we miss the thrill of the  engagement period.  The big question, of course, is did she get the right  man.<br />If my interpretation of the foreshadowing on the final page is  correct, the next Agatha should be the best of the series thus far.	2000-06-11

One of the happiest times of her life was during his 18-month marriage to Hester who  had a son named Christo.  Emma formed a deep bond with her stepbrother and  after many years apart, runs into him in Paris just as she is leaving to  return to England and try to become reacquainted with her father.<br />Emma's  story is one of taking a second look at the people you think you know so  well.  What she discovers about her relationship with her father and  brother is very enlightening and helps her resolve her own feelings about  the new love that has come into her life.<br />As always with Rosamunde  Pilcher books, a most satisfying read and one that leaves you dreaming of  the beach at Cornwall and sitting down to tea with scones and lemond curd.	2000-05-04

Haunted by his death, she seeks help from a famous psychic  and, in a spell-binding climax, finds closure to the end of her marriage.  The heroine, Nell MacDermott, is surrounded by a cast of well-defined  supporting characters.  She is delightful as is her curmudgeon of a  grandfather, her spinster aunt, a handsome pediatric surgeon and many  others.  I was literally on the edge of my seat and completely terrified by  the ending.  It's a definite can't-put-down book, so start it when you have  several free hours ahead.	2000-04-28

Selina, the heroine, is naive and impulsive and does not come across as the  strong female character we get in Mrs. Pilcher's later works.  Selina sets  off from England to find the father she never knew and was told was dead.  Because of a photo on a book jacket, she thinks her father is a writer  living in Spain.  When she arrives unannounced he tells her in no uncertain  terms that he is not her father and she needs to go back to London.  Selina  cannot seem to leave this man and even hides her passport when he forces  her to go to the airport.  I was shocked when I learned what the real  connection between this young girl and this man was.  Because it is not set  in England or Scotland as most of her novels are, we miss the wonderful  descriptive setting Mrs. Pilcher is noted for.  This was Mrs. Pilcher's  first novel under her own name and was first published in 1967.  Although  nowhere near the standards she set with &quot;The Shell Seekers,&quot;  &quot;September,&quot; and &quot;Coming Home,&quot; it is a short and  worthwhile read for her legions of fans, of which I am most definitely a  part.	2000-04-20

As her mother is dying, she tells Rebecca about the family in Cornwall that she has never known.  Rebecca travels to the estate of her grandfather, a  once-famous artist, to inform him of the death of his only daughter.  Rebecca is a thorougly likeable heroine and is surrounded by a cast of  well-defined secondary characters from the cousins to the aunt to the  butler.  Although written before her more famous novel, &quot;The Shell  Seekers,&quot; many of the enticing elements of that book are found  here---the description of the beach at Cornwall, the artist's studio, and  the enigmatic young man who has a profound influence on the main character.  This is a most satisfying read for all and a definite must for those of us  who can never get enough of Rosamunde Pilcher.	2000-04-15

You will meet a woman getting impregnated by her best friend's husband, a career woman and her crazy  father, a bride-to-be who gets the ultimate revenge on an old boyfriend who  did her wrong, a nun looking for love in a most unorthodox manner, a mother  reunited with the son she gave up for adoption, a woman who follows her  husband to find out if he's cheating on her, and an aging actress who wants  to recapture the past.  Their paths all cross on one night at this hotel.<br />I chose the book because I am a big fan of Maeve Binchy and she wrote  one of the chapters.  Guessing which author wrote which chapter becomes a  guessing game for the reader familiar with these authors.<br />This is not  as good as Binchy's own novels, but definitely enjoyable and worth your  time.	2000-04-04
