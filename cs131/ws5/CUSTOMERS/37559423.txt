I  don't think there was ever a more profound story teller in our generation than Carol Lynn Pearson. In this tale she tells the story of a local theatre holding auditions for a play... but what the reader soon learns is that the play is in his own life and he is the star. A must have gift book for the Holidays.	2004-12-22

Anne is truly a gem, and with this incredible book, this duo with Celine they fill the need that people have to celebrate the life of the newborn through song and sight.<br /><br />Celine is one of the most gifted vocalists of our generation and she has a great love for her son and I am so happy that she paired up with a photographer who could adequately capture that love and celebration.<br /><br />A must have for new parents or grandparents!	2004-10-14

Thank goodness that petty, small minded, bored place called ENGLAND is not my homeland. The establishment seems to enjoy driving human beings into the ground with their yellow journalism, press stalkings, and more. That is a cursed land in my humble opinion and I am saddened that Diana did not have the chance to move to the good ole USA and once and for all enjoy a good life.<br />This book made me cry one minute, laugh the next, and question Paul's emotional health all in one.<br />I think there is something in the water there that makes people crazy, seriously. There are so many dead bodies (proverbial) of shattered lives and people who take pleasure in humiliating others, etc. that the Monarchy should be shut down and the government over there restructured.<br />There's too many people without enough to do I think so they sit around conjuring up mean press stories so that they can gain some imaginary self esteem and be recognized for inane phrases such as &quot;The Dutchess of Pork&quot; and so on.<br />God must have thought so too, long ago even, or He wouldn't have led so many people AWAY from that place. Those Brits need more fresh air, clean water, and land to romp those twisted minds on.<br />Diana was one of the most remarkable human beings to live in my lifetime and the establishment still, to this day, treats her like dirt. There's just something so twisted about their social structures. Power, money, fame, religion. I think they are all ergot poisioned!<br />Why don't they have any statues of Diana? None of it makes any sense to me. Spend your travel dollars and go to a better place, or better yet, visit one of Diana's favorite charities and serve. Don't feed that place. Those brits all need to get a tan and have some moles removed, and brush their smelly looking teeth.<br />This is the saddest story of my generation.	2004-03-20

The intriguing time line and the details of the codes in this book are alluring to say the least. You'll never look at the Last Supper the same way. Don't want to be a spoiler, but I could not put this book down. An easy read if you've already studied this stuff in art history, etc.	2004-02-23

That is what the head of my fine art department told me when I was majoring in fine art photography years ago. This type of photographic collection and historical explanation is a part of American art history and not to be overlooked. The guys who worked in the mercury vapored darkrooms basically sacrificed their lives for some of this stuff. If you ever see these at estate sales, etc. buy them and put them away, there are only a limited number of them floating around from an era gone by. Great book, must have for the serious photographer.	2003-10-11

Any text like this should employ a panel of those who have actually had cardiac surgery. I felt it missed a bit of that point of view that would help smooth out the patient care, such as the customary protocol of quickly pulling out lead wires 7 days after surgery when tissue has had time to secure them to the heart tissue. The peritoneal tube removal is not even that bad. Something's just not right about some of the things, although I appreciate the detailed clinical view and have great confidence in those procedures to keep the patient well and alive.	2003-10-09

Watch the dark tones and you'll be fine as you read the info. The object is to come away having learned some secrets of what to expect and those are very very interesting.<br />There was also a case of a transplant recipient who began using vocabulary words from the donor and then later when the patient met the donor's family and used those rare words randomly they were floored. Good read.	2003-10-09

It contains the lost puzzle pieces, released by Sue's family, to the mysterious Emily Dickinson. Sue wanted this story told at the right time. The sheer talent in these writings is amazing. Here was a girl who spent her days as a recluse doing laundry and dishes and writing letters and carrying them around in her pockets. The pen and paper, written word, was what connected the lone Emily to her outside world, her loves, her friends, and now to the rest of us. A must have for any writer who studies her.	2003-07-30

I like the part, it makes me laugh, when he talks about a vacation he took with his family once and it flooded.

This book is proof that we must learn from history or stand condemned to repeat it.<br />It is bizarre how the early settlers operated and how there was no true separation of church and State, blame abounded if someone had a seizure. Evidence shows that ergot poisioning led the the sympotmatic behavior of the poor class of females who mostly ate the rye bread, etc. and how society, with it's fearmonging idiocy was more readily willing to blame some psychotic make-believe of \\"being a witch\\" on those poor girls than of using their brains and finding a scientific explanation.<br />It's hard to tell who was more nuts... the people with ergot poisoning or the clergy making the ridiculous judgements!<br />I was blown out of the water when I read how a woman with a hemerroid was thought to have a \\"witches teat\\" that they believed she nursed secret witches and goblins at night from (talk about disgusting beliefs) and how these poor ladies were dunked, hanged, shot, be-headed because of a naturally occurring blood vessel protruding from [...]after child birth!<br />Good God, I'm glad they didn't have truck drivers back then because they have the most hemerroids of any sector of the population! Can you just see all these guys at the witch trial having to bend over and moon the court and then be taken out to the pond and dunked repeatedly till they fessed up to being a witch or killed??!!!<br />All you have to do is read this book and you can see, even today, in your own circle of society how there are still [people]like this running around rampant.	2003-04-22

It was astounding to me to see so much history! I have since read it seven times over the years and I still love the part about the Anti-Nephi-Lehi's who opt for peace instead of war after they had sworn off killing. What were they to do when the enemy descended from the hill on them? They made a promise and did not want to back track... so they knelt on the earth and bowed down and let the enemy take them, slay them. Until the enemy could kill no more of these defenseless people and they too dropped their swords and joined with them as friends. Powerful stuff.<br />I also like the account in 3Nephi where it discusses Christ's appearance on the American Continent. I just think this is the most amazing thing to ever be recorded. The details are astounding, and it certainly helps clarify a lot of things that other churches have altered or changed in the Holy bible.<br />Two texts that give historical data of Christ's reality, the Holy Bible and this book simply chase off all doubt that He lived and does live!	2003-03-04

And, the guy who wrote it is a rat fink of sorts. It almost makes me sad that he revealed so much of the Princess that was her right to keep secret, and that he did it boringly. I don't know what I feel worse about... reading gossip from a snitch or that he made it so awfully boring, like an old western epic that you just fall asleep half way through. AFter realizing I was yawning more than reading, trying desperately to stay activated so as not to miss a thing, I grew bored half way through and put the book down and have not picked it back up again. I keep telling myself that I'm missing something good and I should finish it, but even that does not motivate the completion of the read. You know it's bad when an ardent fan of Diana's cannot even finish juicy &quot;gossip&quot; about her. The boredom about killed me. I'm sorry I spent money on this.	2003-02-28

Next to Leonardo DaVinci few painters have influenced me so heavily as Trevor Southey. His keen mind and ability for spatial depth and detailed renderings simply transform a flat surface into mystical caves and places as if the canvas is the looking glass and one could easily step inside and enjoy a very real world, even more real than this one is.<br />Trevor floats a painted object on the painting effectively so that the meaning of the portrait is even more burrowed effectively in one's mind.<br />I first discovered Trevor when he supplied some fabulou sketches for Carol Lynn's pearson's early work and have since made him my most prized and collected artist. I was pleasantly surprized when Carol Lynn surprised me with his autographed book as a thank you for some work she and I tackled together.<br />I love you Trevor! As well, Trevor is the only artist I have ever asked to paint my portrait. I just can't feel that I've been accurately captured as a human being until he puts my image on canvas with his stroke of the brush.	2003-02-28
