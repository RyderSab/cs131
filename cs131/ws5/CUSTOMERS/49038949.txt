Everyone of a literary bent who I've spoken to including many of my friends all know about it.  We seem to regard this book as a pretty brilliant read. <br /> <br />Living in England the outstanding quality of the work is the way it captures something of this country, particularly in London like patterns on the seats of an underground train or the details of shops - familiar to some of us - in a way that makes them stand out.  We no more take them for granted.  This is about our everyday world that is so often not mentioned in specific.  In this context this book is very much a British work that relates to an English setting from the time it was written in terms of environments, names, dialogues, educational institutes/systems and everyday lives and problems. <br /> <br />The protagonist is incapable of feeling the emotions of others and the book is very much an exploration of feeling.  I've heard that the book is a very accurate portrait of autistic thinking and it seems to be based on a great deal of research and experience. <br /> <br />This book is audacious in its style but the story itself is no tangle.  There were so many scientific and mathematical details in the book that the character relates that really taught me something I had no grasp of. <br /> <br />I cannot truly confess to understanding the feelings of others but this book leads me to understand those who feel them and their own feelings differently - perhaps less.  The protagonist is not devoid of feeling but they are not registered so consciously except perhaps for the key emotions like sadness or fear. <br /> <br />When his mother cries with grief all he observes is that she wails like an animal in a TV documentary.  He cannot feel her pain.  But his emotions are registered by him reacting violently at a physical level even though he can't explain them.  Such contents evoke a certain humour but also a deep pain which is never expressed explicitly.  But the teenager does have a firm notion of right and wrong which we cannot disagree with and a good sense of direction - even if he can't explain why being so daunted by the complexity of the future.  Thus he has an inimitable form of wisdom that guides him and helps him cope. <br /> <br />The protagonist comes across generously in sharing his autistic world with us which is not a cold one and often highly mathematical and logical.  Optimistic at the end, this is a profoundly effective style of simple narrative designed to convey something of the universe, England and human emotion.   <br /> <br />Graphics, maps and diagrams uniquely keep the work afloat and animated.  We literally see how the boy thinks at a visual level. <br /> <br />I think the book emphasises the importance of feelings in our world and how we relate to them and manipulate them.  It challenges our sense of values in the context of feelings and hopefully encourages us to develop our sensitivity to our feelings and those of others.  <br /> <br />	2005-09-04

The amount of factual material lavished in this tome about the origins of the motor car and the search for excellence via the Mercedes Benz brand should keep the afficianado glued for hours.  The pictures are also excellent.  Written in about three or four languages within the same book, the descriptions are backed by photographs - good ones charting the evolution of the Merc from the 19th century right to the modern sleek saloon.  I think this is very much for the Mercedes buff or collector and I bought it as a gift.  I think this book would be good if it showed how the Merc could grow some wings and start being more in harmony with the Earth's environment based on what sort of fuel it burns and fuel efficiency rather than just talk about technical specifications in self congratulatory terms.  Still this book is about \\"man's\\" achievement with the motor car and there are things in this which you could admire.	2005-08-23

Well, Symposium is one of the most serious discussions about this issue datable to the 5th century BCE.  At that time, Greeks at dinner parties used to sprawl themselves on couches with food and wine and a little music, be ministered by slaves and while eating or after have a spirited conversation/discussion.  Well this \\"soire\\" takes place with Socrates, and its details are related second hand by the author Plato.<br /><br />As translations go, this particular issue is one of the best on the market and the author had discussed it's details with a Kabbalist teacher of mine Glynn Davies.  A translation is dependent to a greater or lesser extent on the author's appreciation and interpretation of the sorts of contents involved - and this translation is pretty current.  There is a good introduction about the characters, especially Alcibiades and Xenophon who were real people from the time.<br /><br />I think this book is a wonderful evocation of deep thinking from the Greek world starting with sensual love and then going on to describe a sort of spiritual love that subverts our expectations of what we would understand by Love personified as a deity.  Socrates is in the beginning seen to enter into a meditational reverie which probably indicates that some such sages did meditate as in Indian traditions in order to obtain wisdom.  Later, Socrates recounts the wisdom transmitted by an Oracle called Diotima (almost as if to say, \\"this is not what I think (though it is actually) but it was conveyed to me as follows by this trustworthy source\\".<br /><br />Some of your friends should appreciate the wisdom of this book.  Above all, it is The Symposium, the important conversation among friends at dinner talking about something of the sublime in a way that echoes but also seriously deepens the level of our own more mundane discussions on romance and true love that crop up regularly if you're at that sort of age.ge.	2005-08-23

Facts abound, facts about tigers, rations on lifeboats ... and also a terrific opening ambit.  In the middle of the sea, you burn in the sun and then get a taste of tiger dung.  The facts begin to blur, you can't say if he's being real about it. <br /> <br />It's not very clear about whether it's first person or third, a bit of both.  Identifying Pi in Canada. <br /> <br />You can read and read this and then it becomes silly, ghastly.  Floating green islands with acid lakes at night.  You think, why can't he give me a credible story please? <br /> <br />But then you are revealed in your own mirror, why should he?  He can damn well write what he likes and here I am reading it. <br /> <br />I thought it a brilliant, well presented book.  Just be prepared for a little disappointment after being adrift forever with such laborious details while out in the open ocean, under the sun. <br /> <br />Easy to read, genius author and well, a wonderful appetizer.  I have heard that a film version is in the pipeline.	2005-08-08

When they read it, they want to pass it on.  It is by word of mouth I got this, and it was so gripping.    We enter the putrid fetid streets of Paris described with such earthy deliberation - the genius Grenouile is born.  How rare - a book all about man's least appreciated and talked about sense - dissected to perfection.    The author seems to have a penchant for young red headed beauties - and it is so improbable, that they could smell the best, but what if the best smell was created?  What subtleties lie in smells that we cannot ever articulate as we think it's all because of what we see and hear that we strongly like or dislike palpable stimuli?    Absolutely wonderful stuff and I'm afraid I found myself identifying with the protagonists shy tendencies and his dislike of humanity and its self importance - much as in the last chapter of Gulliver's travels where horses are seen to be superior to us.    Suskind is a shy brilliant writer and this book is now being filmed for a motion picture.	2005-08-08

Collis here dissects the highlights that led to the \\"Opium wars\\", actually skirmishes between Britain and China, where Imperial Britain gained ground over the Celestial Kingdom that had for so long treated them as Barbarians from which they gained some pecuniary advantage. <br /> <br />The Chinese remained conservative in their treatment of the British since the 18th century and had not grasped that by the mid 19th century Britain was a power to be reckoned with.  By then, British had taken Opium trading with China to huge heights but her merchants were still greedy for yet more market space and getting shy of selling a common drug to China to enable them to make a profit. <br /> <br />This book is proud and British in flavour, comparing China to some extent with Japan that maintained a similar hubris as the Chinese.  It is I think pretty objective and really well written, very gripping and revealing in its details. <br /> <br />The author has structured the work rather like a fantastic story in several acts.  There are good maps and enough illustrations.  It whets your appetite for more .... and I found this after reading Chris Patten's East and West and Tai Pan.  This book was probably a source for Clavell's Tai Pan, Jardine being one of the original Tai Pan's of Hong Kong. <br /> <br />The Opium Wars directly lead to the birth of Hong Kong and was a sign of things going wrong for Imperial China.  The British and French shamelessly muscled in on their advantage subsequent to the events of the 1840s.  The Chinese always maintained their cool and were incapable of fighting back and as a land power, had to give way to the naval blandishments of the then western powers. <br /> <br />A really wonderful book if you're English, detailing aristocratic China and the elements of British Political hegemony and how they handled the unravelling of a staus quoe in China from which the crown had profiteered without candidly admitting it was from opium. <br /> <br />The author does not defent opium trading but is clear it was not a good thing.  It was a game in which as is clear, Chinese officialdom was involved on a large scale. <br /> <br />A fascinating glimpse of the Chinese who normally seem to reveal so little of themselves, their values or their cultures to some of us barbarians.	2005-06-12

I think Mansfield ranks as true literary bloom of the first quarter of the 20th century as a generality, hobnobbing with Irish talent like Joyce and fitting into that stage that also held T. E. Lawrence and John Buchan - the male writers always dominating.  Mansfield represents the rank outsider, not male, not \\"English\\" but breaking through into recognition while she lived.    Her writing is distinctly impressionist in flavour.  Sentences broken and stories only half complete.  But she writes beautifully, often echoing her impending death from TB.  An outsider with her sexuality in how she experimented including a brief pretence of motherhood and her spirituality.  She attended Gurdjieff's centre and was obviously fond of the pragmatism of certain Eastern traditions compared to the prevailing cult.     But she only reveals so much in her writing.  So much remaining unsaid.  Happy stories like \\"Bliss\\" and funny stories like \\"The school mistress\\".  So many details from life at the time like ships, parties, schools, courtship, and the lives of ordinary people from the well bred elites to the downtrodden poor.  Mansfield frequently displays a sympathy for the underdog and cries out about the transience of things and the lack of stability in pleasure - vaguely Buddhist even ...  But her stories are yet so English with glimpses of her native New Zealand from which she was divorced.  She write well about the dazzle of things like summer or flowers, children, sounds and people - everything highlighted.  She is so good with colloquial speech and represents it well ... conversations that bring out sentiments of characters and in the reader.    You can't get enough of this genre.  The only genre she knew.  Little cartoons of short stories, almostalways making a point, sometimes sharp but not overtly moralistic.  Everything is so precise, a melody from the heart.  This like any other collection of her work is worth attention, to read or as a gift.    The introduction is good and Mansfield will probably for ever remain not too well known but a gem to those who find her.	2005-06-12

It is aimed more at women and women may enjoy it more. <br /> <br />This book fails in describing strategies in establishing first contact.  It also fails in making gross generalisations on male sexuality - men are effectively sex mad beings and if you can work out their sexual fantasies you may succeed.  Not true.  Generally men prefer to be fed and looked after and sex is possibly a component of this ...  It fails to describe problems in mixed relationships in the context of cultures and religions. <br /> <br />I think the problem is that love is ideally something deeper, based on companionship and not based on easy strategies and chemicals though this explains things part way. <br /> <br />I found my copy second hand - it had been discarded. <br /> <br />Yes this book has some good lessons but it is ultimately a superficial treatment that seems to suggest you can control physiological attributes to your advantage.  Sadly it's not quite so simple.  This book is most useful in suggesting generalised differences between men and women and thus how to cope with the opposite sex. <br /> <br />I found this book getting a bit flaky towards the end I'm afraid.  A more human treatment is necessary rather than magic formulas and being manipulative.	2005-06-04

Some pages are blue or purple with very attractive motifs and graphics inside.  Nice pictures too of Goldie at work, rest and play including snapshots of her children and partner Kurt Russell.    The content is only losely biographic.  This is more Goldie Hawn's philosophy of life through the window of her journeys and successes in the movie industry.  Co-authored with another.  It reads very well.    Little subchapters called \\"Postcards\\" capturing experiences.  There are also poems and thoughts: \\"Is our smile coded for in our DNA or is it nurtured?\\" (paraphrased).  In this sense the book has some fine quotations.    As a woman who represents openness and seems to be something of a spiritual student this book is great for exploring themes on happiness, relationships, death and being human.  Designed to bring out the best in anybody.    This book and its sentiments represent a fantastic contribution to genuinely making the world a better place - not by throwing money at problems but by being well inside.    I liked reading it - ideal as a gift or to dip into though not to be read from cover to cover necessarily.  Really well edited - not much gossip, thankfully.	2005-05-26

I've not finished, but, as someone looking into Hong Kong and Chinese culture, I find the book absorbing, gripping and can related to its hero, Struan.  I don't think there are many real Struans out there and in this sense this book is hyperbolic fiction.    Having said this it is fiction based on fact and represents a fairy story of the birth of Hong Kong including its place names and heritage.    I find remarks on Chinese culture especially useful and topical even in a modern context though Chinese readers will probably find the book patronising and one sided (having said this the book take pains to be fair, both sides view the other as barbarians a great deal).  This is a sort of British version of events.    Much of the book seems true, based on factual material on Chinese culture in relation to Hong Kong coming from Chris Patten in \\"East and West\\".  Indeed the author has a good grounding in Chinese culture so I think his ideas are accurate enough.      This book tackles mixed relationships, business negotiations, the Chinese and their ways, their systems of marriage ... and is a really good source of the elements that make Chinese culture so attractive, colourful and rich.    As for the story.  Well, it is gripping enough and I can't get enough of Hong Kong so I'm taking in every word.  Pity that Hong Kong has reverted to China I say but hopefully China will become like Hong Kong in time rather than the other way around.	2005-05-26

I have the old fashioned politically incorrect version and have to re-read it to pick up the important points.<br /><br />Some people understandably don't like this sort of book.  It could make one so superficial to do things by rote all because you want something - but Carnegie himself points this out and scorns selfish motives.<br /><br />It is ultimately about survival in a tough, competitive world and being genuinely nice to people - which naturally works.  Especially good if you want to deal with Americans as Americans already know the lessons of this book and have studied it compared to continentals.<br /><br />No book can necessarily help you get a top job or win the love of your life, no matter how much they promise to - especially if you mechanically try and follow instructions supplied in them.  But for general principles this book is so important.<br /><br />After all etiquette is something taught by Confucius, the Buddha and many historical personages - and this book has looked at all the greatest individuals before it came up with its strategies and rules of thumb.<br /><br />The original book was based on so much research (and I don't really want the update) - that it would repay study.	2005-05-15

Ms Van Gorkhum has also written a recent book on Cetasika's or mental factors/flavours associated with consciousness and she has also written a book that may be out soon on the Pacchayas or conditional relations. <br /> <br />The first book is simply brilliant.  It opens up the abhidhamm in a way the Abhidhamma Sangaha cannot to a complete beginner.  The Sangaha is of course a primary, vital reference - but Van Gorkhum's treatment is more like a dictionary of some of the major types of consciousness as summarised in the A. Sangaha. <br /> <br />I can't put the book down and read it chapter by chapter - rereading.  I'd really like to study her other books when I have the time and own them as this is the secret doctrine, the magical teaching on how the mind works. <br /> <br />I hope you get the opportunity to study this.	2005-05-14

In this sense I absorbed an enormous amount of well thought out material.  Patten is obviously cautious about embracing everything Chinese in the context of the Communist Party there.  This book would be loved by those who long for Chinese freedom and it makes some interesting predictions about what the future may hold. <br /> <br />The quotations in it from Confucius, and various Western great thinkers like Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill and Carl Popper were highly illuminating.  Patten uses Chinese ideas to undermine the face saving rhetoric from the Communist party. <br /> <br />This is a well written, well thought out, monumental book from the last Governor of Hong Kong.  I hope it helps Hong Kong to remain rich and free, the way Patten tried to make it as Governor. <br /> <br />Truly the last great British colony to go ...	2005-05-14

Sadly, since this book was published, Wilson has tried to recant from his position of being something of a sceptic or heretic (which he never was anyway) and this probably explains why the book is out of print - because Wilson has since disowned it and become more of a believer as attested by his eulogies to biblical history published recently.    The book attempts to cast a skeptical eye on Jesus but actually it is soft skepticism.  Jesus is shown very much as a saintly figure with mysterious aspects.  Some ambiguous areas are examined.  Jesus' miracles are explained largely on the basis of hypnosis.  Crucifiction and ressurection are explained very well.    Gospel scholarship has been lucidly explained to a layman including most of the evidence for Jesus from non Christian sources, possible datings and areas of controversy.    I was especially touched at the way that James the brother of Jesus was cast out from Gentile Christianity and how Peter was emphasised as the key disciple on which the Roman Church was established.  The complexity of Jesus' family in that Mary was not really a virgin and probably had about 6 children is brought startlingly to light.    This is a very easy book to read and casts a critical eye on the formation of the Gentile Church, especially after emperor Constantine.  It is clear that much has been lost from the original teachings of Christianity, largely in a Jewish form to begin with.    This book is a Christian perspective on Jesus, echoing \\"Honest to God\\" which the author mentions.  More critical books have since been published.	2005-02-11

This book enables just that.  Complicated ephemeris books are a hassle, expensive and difficult to get hold of, especially if you are not an astrologer. About a half of this book is taken up as a very simple ephemeris which shows where all the important planets are from around 1900 to 2000.  The layout is simple and huge amounts of data are compressed into user friendly pages.  The book provides a basic overview of what planetary positions mean, and then it does personality assessments of all the planets through all the signs - especially the important planets from the Sun to Saturn.  It does not go into detail about houses and the ascendant because it is a rough guide to a rough chart.  This is often all you may want to know, and at this level very useful.  Just to find someone's moon sign is a revealation.  The personality profiles for each planet in each sign of an essay on one page and a chart on the other showing negative and positive traits of the placement and how they can be interchanged is once again reader friendly and the book has interesting diagrams and icons (these are not in-depth for generational extra Saturn planets).  Altogether a simple, vibrant and very informative book that is like a magnifying glass into the first few stages of astrological analysis based on planets in signs.	2005-01-06

The book is inclusive in describing the most basic issues connected with human life and suffering and how Buddhism tackles these problems head on. <br /> <br />It contains a number of examples including descriptions from experiences in life (including those of the author's pupils), examples from the Buddha's instruction and demonstrations from teachers of diverse Buddhist traditions, welded together by an uncomplicated direct narrative. <br /> <br />The prose can be easy to relate to and is often chatty, colourful and even humorous, in addressing issues of blame, separation, environmental degradation, freedom and other life experiences.  It then introduces antidotes to problems fairly systematically in the form of morality, restraint, attenuating the hindrances and developing the eightfold path, these issues being explored fairly fully from chapter to chapter.  This method is similar to the graduated discourse adopted by the Buddha repeatedly within the Pali Canon. <br /> <br />Alan James offers a formulaic approach stressing a Vipassana mode with some description of calm meditation.  He effectively urges the readers to gain the first path (stream entry) and not to tarry in samatha practice but to develop insight on the basis of access concentration and the suppression of the five hindrances.  The author expresses confidence that this is a practical and achievable undertaking.  A strength of the book is how it deals with letting go and obtaining restraint.  The author's solutions in developing skills in such practice are persuasive in developing what he describes as \\"The Quiet Mind\\" in the last chapter. <br />	2004-12-30

Chah and the numerous short compendiums of Venerable Chah's teachings made available freely through branch monasteries.  The release of his talks in a wider context as a commercial venture presents significant challenges, especially in relating them to those unfamiliar with Theravada Buddhist monasticism.  Unlike printed editions of his teachings including \\"A Still Forest Pool\\" where speeches are sectionalised with introductory remarks on each incident the dialogues in Being Dharma from several contexts link together to form an apparent whole with no obvious contrast between sections or adequate contextual explanation.  There are six chapters (e.g. Hearing Dharma, Practising Dharma, Teaching Dharma) with sub-chapter headings and one interesting dialogue between the monk and a layman that stands out in an otherwise essay like format with varying emphases between the main chapters. <br /> <br />Due to the strength of editing and the eclectical approach, whether we get a balanced portrait of the teachings remains to be answered.  Whereas Ven. Chah is known to have taught a mixture of Samatha-Vipassana meditation, the book leans towards Vipassana and is quite ascetic in its approach.  One irritating aspect of the style was the obvious genderisation of third person pronouns in referring to hypothetical individuals (e.g. \\"he or she\\") firmly in favour of \\"she\\" of which 13 examples were noted (with two uses of he).  Asian languages do possess neutral terms equivalent to \\"their\\" and this fashion in translation seems to mar its precision and veracity, raising questions on other issues of substance in the work.  Pali terms Ajhan Chah would have used are rendered in Sanskrit. <br /> <br />The most valuable aspect of the book is Ajahn Chah's rustic yet resonant style of teaching providing hope and instruction: \\"What exactly is Dhamma?  Everything in this world.\\", \\"Merit is like raw meat, which will go bad ... Wisdom is the salt that preserves it.\\",  \\"So the Buddha still exists ... But some ... feel frustrated and say, Oh man, if the Buddha were still here ...\\"    Ajahn Chah draws interesting comparisons between humans and animals stating that many humans can be at the level of animals.  A constant refrain is the importance of not being eager to train or teach others and there are sections on meditation, scepticism and the importance of self-reliance and the dangers inherent in modern day comforts and conveniences which can engender laziness.  Ajahn Chah emphasises the basics and practical concerns such as keeping surroundings neat and tidy. <br /> <br />A great deal of this book is about mortality and impermanence and I don't think these sentiments are adequately balanced with aspects on joy and freedom to suite lay people new to Dhamma teaching.  On the whole, this is a valuable and fairly comprehensive distillation of teachings from the Thai master which would be most suited to those already familiar with Buddhism. <br />	2004-12-30
US	49038949	R1ZPIRLKH8U984	1559391634	516431091	Working with Anger	Books	5	7	11	N	N	Childproofing your exposed buttons	American Buddhist nun Chodron has in this work produced a detailed and concise handbook which could be used practically by Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike.  Of greed, hate and delusion representing the three roots of suffering, anger is the most easily seen with prominence in the sphere of relationships to other people.  It is at this level that the book applies in our interactions with kin, associates and adversaries and how to change tensions into harmony.  The presentation in part echoes \\"How to win friends and influence people\\" by D. Carnegie, though its tone is more esoteric and not one to help improve ones' charisma. <br /> <br />The narrative hits home its points e.g. in defending itself against the charge that anger could actually be beneficial by devices including a disarming logic and everyday examples both hypothetical and real.  In the former, the personal third person pronoun (like in many modern books) switches easily though unpredictably between genders.  It also draws on traditional texts and advice from meditation masters as well as Chodron's quietly forthright style. <br /> <br />About 18 chapters summarise all the facets of anger manifestation including how it applies to oneself.  A strength of the book is how it fashions modern ways of thinking and concepts to make aspects of the teaching relevant e.g. \\"When Our Buttons Are Pushed\\" or \\"Conflict Styles\\".  The book thus combines modern psychological approaches to understanding and dealing with stress with ancient wisdom.  Topics include defining anger, patience, recognising anger, criticism and blame, dealing with enemies, envy, love and compassion and developing wisdom.  The book contains two summarising appendices to clarify the lessons it teaches with a glossary and reading list. <br /> <br />This book will be particularly useful in penal institutes to help offenders and the probation service in \\"anger management courses\\" and wherever such lessons could apply from schools to Customer Service.Readers who think they do not need such a guide may in fact discover reservoirs of resentment within themselves after reading it.  As an interesting digest it could be equally translated to help deal with alternative problems such as manifestations of greed.  This is very much a book that points the way without detailed analysis of mind and liberation with some challenging wisdom.  It points to the interconnectedness of all beings and the futility of anger, not least under conditions of \\"cyclic existence\\". <br />	2004-12-29

It mirrors related works expanding on the original Jataka tales with a wealth of historical, anthropological and cultural detail and much reference to Sri Lanka.  Such secondary material (e.g. Buddhist folk tales) of local importance is often lost and provides novel material to any curious reader.  No translation of the SDV appears to be available in English and this work is a new part translation with 26 chapters, each generally representing the biography of a female disciple from the time of the Buddha. <br /> <br />The principal comparison for the SDV and this selection is offered by E. W. Burlingame's Buddhist Legends (1921) representing the original Dhammapada Commentary in three volumes through the PTS.  It is apparent that many of the stories as translated from the SDV are mostly the same as from the Dhammapada Commentary.  Obeysekare places her work in relief by (1) focussing on women in early Buddhism and (2) changes in the discussions and appreciation of women which are apparent between the 5th and 13th centuries, aligning her introductory discussion and some notes to topical issues of gender studies and feminism. <br />Portraits of Buddhist Women is too subjective in tackling the second aspect covering an interval of approximately a millennium with sizeable shifts in events as well as attitudes.  E.g. between the 5th and 13th centuries the nun's lineage from the time of the Buddha became extinct in Sri Lanka.  Furthermore, the capital moved and Buddhism was subject to some disastrous upheavals.  These changes are not outlined in the book.  The introduction does cover aspects of the style of the work and the flow of the narrative and the possible attitude of the author towards women thought to be the Elder Dharmasena along with possible changes in attitudes of monks towards women disciples. <br />The translated stories are carefully selected incorporating some of the most important female disciples and the presentations are fairly full with accompanying footnotes.  The English could have been more polished and some translated terms may be too literal.  E.g. \\"the evil of being obsessed with color\\" with reference to the Chief Disciple Khema where beauty or appearance would have better substituted color.  Adequate details are not given for many untranslated terms and of pronunciation including proper names (e.g. Cinca).  The footnotes are sometimes circular with inadequate explanation.  The Acknowledgements at the front of the book suggest that the book could have taken longer in gestation with more care given to explanation, sources, editing and prose. <br /> <br />This is a reasonable and often interesting introductory text to derived commentarial material that represents an untapped seam for further translations and scholarship.  Portraits of Buddhist Women is a useful study to add to those existing on female disciples of the Buddha as well as issues on gender, particularly from an Asian perspective. <br />	2004-12-29

Books	5	16	22	N	N	An evolving polemic	Since this book came out, Christian scholars - true believers like US Professor Elaine Pagels have produced works that represent partial vindications of this book. <br /> <br />The one think about Freke and Gandy I disagree with is that Jesus did not exist.  Most scholars agree he did and there are gospels, some present, some missing which support his existence.  Professor Vermes has unearthed something of the Jewish Jesus.  Jesus was very much a Jewish teacher who apparently was not intereseted in teaching gentiles (see any scholarly work on Jesus as a historical personage) - \\"cast not thy pearls before swine\\". <br /> <br />But it is true that there is very little substantially that we can say on Jesus (given most of the gospels did get facts wrong or distorted facts to suite \\"prophecies\\") - certainly at an archaeological level and it is true that Christianity \\"is the most Syncretistic\\" of world religions based on a Christian writer in \\"A handbook of living religions\\".  In other words, Christianity does combine elements from several traditions including Judaism and Greek traditions with possible contributions from Egypt.   <br /> <br />It is also true that modern Chritianity, \\"Literarism\\" in the book was almost single handedly put together by St Paul - a man who despised some of Jesus' original diciples like St Peter. <br /> <br />Freke and Gandy have set in train a clearer understanding of what Christianity should be.  Not John's Gospel and the great commission but a richer, gnostic vein, as highlighted in the gospel of St Thomas. <br /> <br />Freke and Gandy's work is an expose of the dark side of Christianity.  A side that has been inflicted not just on ancient pagans, but the entirety of S. America and most of Africa and parts of Asia where the bulk of true believers now live - at the expense of indigenous religions of which \\"Paganism\\", Greek civilisation and \\"Gnosticism\\" including Jewish Christianity as it was originally practised were victims. <br /> <br />Ruthless, at times scholarly, compelling and very gripping - I would recommend this book to those who wish to study Christianity with clarity.  Today, Elaine Pagels and other scholars are trying to restore a spirit of the original Christianity - its harmonies with other traditions rather than its absolutism.  I wish them luck given the fierce opposition they are likely to face from certain elements of a more established Christianity.	2004-12-13

The author has researched very intensively and the book is heavy on facts, arguments and counter arguments.  There is however, little to take home with you.    I've read extreme versions of the tale including the work by Danish ornithologist Heilmann (birds are proto dinosaurs) and accounts by Robert Bakker (birds are derived dinosaurs).  I tend to prefer the dinosaurs are birds argument which is gaining more momentum with every new fossil unearthed, but this book tries hard to be impartial and creates too much doubt.  The author does not say what she thinks and why which would have been useful.    It is balanced and a good addition summarising our knowledge but there are probably far better works now available.	2004-12-13

The role of St Paul and many of the saints like Peter or lack thereof is revealed.  We also get a digest of the search for the historical new testament.<br /><br />A bit dated, this is an easy read and makes most of what is known available to readers.  I'm not sure whether it glorifies or insults Christ but I feel wiser about him in having read this work.	2004-12-08

It begins well, but I found so much of it quite morbid and fearful, both at the level of political/terrorist violence and at a sexual level. <br /> <br />The author's trademark topic is food which is well treated in his short stories (read Monkfish Moon by him for more) and really well served up in Reef.  This and many other exotic features such as wildlife, native patois are obvious highlights and selling points in the book.  Dialogues are sketchy, incomplete and we can fill in the missing words even if the degree of articulateness is lacking or obtuse. <br /> <br />There are dark, brooding undercurrents and Mr Salgado ultimately is a failed, lonely guy - in romance and in his job (though the romantic side is incomplete - by the end and there may be reconcilliation).  His failure is because of the nature of Sri Lanka itself apart from anything personal.  The way that the governments there cannot be expected to protect people or do any real good and the way the country swings from one extreme to another.  This is captured in the dialogue. <br /> <br />There are also dark sexual overtones/undertones in this book.  Things to do with homosexuality, male bonding, fear psychoses, violence.  Sexual references are covert and psychological - e.g., there is a greatly distorted story of Angulimala, more violent than the original describing a necklace of fingers, but in a subtext, penises.  True to Sri Lankan style, we don't hear much beyond a couple gazing at each other and finding comfort in company.  At the end there is a violent break up, perhaps too violent. <br /> <br />I am concerned that the impression of Sri Lanka conveyed may be overcritical, brooding and dark.  I think the Man Eaters of Punanai by C. Ondaatje, conveys something of Sri Lanka's troubles and potential treasures without any brooding sentiment. <br /> <br />This book was dark, depressing and aromatic.  Good to have read its limpid, chatty and at times disturbing/churning prose.	2004-12-08

This wonderful book combines a travelogue and autobiography including a commentary on his brother's work \\"Running in the family\\" by Michael Ondaatje.<br /><br />The best thing about this book are the pictures.  Only a picture edition in colour works.  Not the subsequent black and white paperback reprints.<br /><br />Most of the book is set as a trip to Sri Lanka visiting Punanai where there lived a man eating leopard in the 1920s.  This trip is actually a recreation of trips with his father in the 1940s, a search for a lost childhood and a devil that drove Christopher's father and drives him - symbolised by the leopard.<br /><br />Interspersed with this is a story of the Ondaatjes in Sri Lanka, particularly with reference to his family - his father, mother, siblings and himself.<br /><br />It is also an account of Sri Lanka written impartially, in the worst throes of civil war in the late 1980s with Tamil Tiger rebels fighting for a separate state.<br /><br />Ondaatje visits troubled territory, but is eager to photograph leopards at Yala national park.  His photos of people, animals and monuments are breathtaking.  Some of the best taken.  So much colour and poignancy, like portraits of a totally exotic world.<br /><br />This book is something of a triumph where Ondaatje, without embelishment talks about the secrets of his own success.  Determination, perseverence, his background.  This is probably as close as he will get to an autobiography.  Much is hidden - his family comes first.  By his own account his best book.<br /><br />A wonderful if sometimes stressful journey through past and present.	2004-11-24

I found the first story and a story about horrifying evening entertainment based upon the creative sexual abuse quite gripping and underworld.  There was also an interesting tale about people in France disappearing due to an unexplained disaster.  These made the book shocking enough which is what the author probably wanted.  The book had a lot of French affinity which would make it appealing to a francophile leaving aside sex and death.    But many of the other stories though interesting and provocative made you ask \\"so what?\\".  One problem is that the author seems to try and project herself as a clever bilingual academic/scriptwriter which does not come across too well.  Though scholarship/erudition when coming out through fiction is welcome, there was a flavour of immoral pretentiousness that made this book not worthy of keeping.  It was a sort of \\"dark fiction, version lite\\".  I gave this book away after finishing it.    I think I'll stick to Katherine Mansfield and some others for the moment as masters of the short story.  The exploration of sexuality, male and female, clothes, objects in further detail  could have helped on which the book could have been a lot stronger.	2004-08-10

One of the first authenticated mentions of the blind men and the elephant and their difficulty in describing one is in the Udana as told by the Buddha. <br /> <br />These are largely short discourses arousing faith and vigour.  Strong, entertaining stuff, with graphic descriptions of Nibbana and the fruits of the good life. <br /> <br />The Ittivuttaka was according to tradition preserved by a little known female disciple of the Buddha who happened to be however, his chief female lay disciple - Khujjuttara.  She walked with a limp and this is her contribution to civilisation. <br /> <br />These two books of the Kuddaka Nikaya have been well translated by the late J.

Lavishly illustrated, well bound with detailed and often poignant descriptions.  It is also reasonably scholarly with lot of quotes and references to follow up leads.  Each bird is given a separate &quot;portrait&quot; and chapter.<br />I think the second edition has not evolved too much from the first.  Pehaps a few maps and a greater sense of urgency in an overview chapter could have made this book more than just a collector's book.  It could have lists of organisations you can join to help prevent extinctions and notes about endemic bird areas - in the style of Roger and Petersen.<br />This remains an important reference though its traditional format has obviously not helped sales as I got mine for a fraction of the published cost.	2004-07-19

The final chapters seem easier to understand.  I think the author is right to have dealt heavily with the normal distribution.  This book is a good place to begin an understanding of statistical methodology.<br />These days you don't really have to know too much about Stats, just something about using your favourite software and correctly interpretting the data and knowing if the tests you've used are correct.  This book goes some way to help such analyses but does not have too much to say on software.<br />I also found the book a little too wordy at times - but it does try to summarise.  More chapters and a greater breakdown could have helped.<br />The best thing about this book is the price and and at that price it can help you to feel cleverer/more confident than you may be at first.

It was mainly written by Harvey mentioned as a secondary author (or someone else called Paul Harvey).  This information comes to me via a Tibetan Buddhist who sponsored Sogyal Rimpoche's arrival and settling down in the UK.  As a reviewer at Amazon.com and a Buddhist practitioner who has met Sogyal, I stand by the above statement.  The informant was quite sure though the communication was provided under informal circumstances.<br />Before I continue, in the publishing world it is probably not uncommon for books to be &quot;authored&quot; by one person but actually written by another.  Jefferey Archer's editor or some other editors often may have written a book under the umbrella of a lucrative author.<br />Sogyal Rimpoche has started Rigpa and earns a lot of money.  His disciples carry cash in suitcases (I gathered from the above source and am not surprised after attending one of Sogyal's retreats).  He was disowned by or he disowned Dujom Rimpoche his teacher.  Sogyal is fond of quoting his familial links and relationship to Dujom or the Dalai Lama and is regarded as some sort of incarnation (aren't we all?).  Sogyal Rimpoche was informed that he was not mature enough to teach in the Nyngma tradition and was asked to return to Tibet.  He refused.<br />Harvey kept the fee and Sogyal harvests the royalties.<br />This book is a cherry picked slice of Tibet's greatest teachings with highlights on death, rebirth, compassion incorporating practices somewhat external to a principal Tibetan source text on death and rebirth which forms the basis of the book.  It is recommended reading before you go on a Sogyal retreat boosting sales.  The book is not especially deep and designed to appeal.  Small wonder it attracts few detractors.<br />It reads rather well I suppose and Rimpoche remains a charismatic teacher.  As long as you don't swallow it lock, stock and smoking barrel.	2004-07-05

It covers enough from peripheries of science and the humanities as well as detailed natural history to make it accessible and interesting to anyone who has the slightest interest in this confusing subject.<br />Though Shreve identifies the complex issues allowing us to doubt everything, the book is far from confusing and there is an enormous amount of travel and biographical notes of the people he has met that Shreve has marshalled in.  By all accounts this was an expensive and time consuming book to put together and almost no stone has been left unturned.<br />I think the fascination with this topic is because it asks the big question - What makes us human?  Fortunately, though many answers are offered, Shreve takes care not to make any dogmatic assertion and provides a balanced overview of all the ideas, key workers and key debates.<br />As a student, I liked the way he discussed the basics of the biological species concept showing how difficult separating species can be at times, especially if using fossils.  He also shows us how lots of ideas can be manufactured only to be holed by later workers or evidence.<br />Most of the book is very fluid.  My only criticism is the lack of more illustrations of neandertals  - perhaps in colour and a lack of any detail on the classic illustration showing Ramapithecus leading to Cromagnon which has been shown so many times, though this famous picture is discussed.<br />I think this book shows what science is not.  It is not about a solution to the problem that you can believe and cling to.  Rather, it is a provisional statement of current understanding and if it seems to explain things, all the better (speaking in the context of human origins).<br />So many people and ideas are mentioned that this is true journalism, no holes barred, sharp, comical, witty and above all accessible.<br />I thouroughly recommend it to anyone.	2004-05-19

Since Henry, there have been and are some good field guides or books with accounts of selected birds but little else of a comprehensive nature.<br />In the 1971 edition which was the best one so far, the illustrations in watercolour are superb, fresh and full of emotion.  Henry painted Coloured plates of the Birds of Ceylon issued in the 1930s, and this book is the next best thing.<br />The later edition issued around 1993 has some changes to the text but the print quality of illustrations is appalling making it less appealing to collectors.<br />I think Henry generally gave wonderful summaries of all the birds (though there was a circularity about his size comparisons: About the size of a mynhah - check mynah - about the size of a starling - no actual sizes are ever given).  He pleads for the birds in danger of extinction unlike many others.<br />Dated but highly collectible - not for people on a quick holiday but someone who revels in the biodiversity of Sri Lanka and India.

I do agree based on other good Amazon reviewers that the book contains many errors and needs corroboration or dismissal on certain points.  Unfortunately I can't tell the facts from the fiction though the main theses is interesting and deserves credit.    Facts:  Some pretty good maps of the world with accurate details did probably exist before Europeans officially discovered those continents - some European navigators possibly used them.    I am reasonably convinced that Chickens came to the new world from Asia based on this book but when - Pre Columbian?  Need to know more.    Chinese junks were truly extraordinary and China was a world Superpower until around 1700.    What this book most convinces me of is that the claims that Europeans were the first to get here or there is patent nonsense though it was probably trumpetted for the sake of colonial hegemony.  Many continents were colonised by \\"first peoples\\" and then recolonised on subsequent occasions, mainly by seafaring nations like the Maoris.  Who was responsible for the good maps found in pre naval Europe?  Though the Chinese are the best candidates, I think it seems a disaster they wrote so little of it and what little they did was destroyed.  This is surprising for such a great civilisation.  I think when I've read some of the other books I will be more convinced.    I would really have liked some pictures of the junks with more information about appearance and construction.    Fiction or moot points that I'm not sure about:    Other reviewers have pointed out some of the errors.    Here are three I've identified.    1. Mylodon's were probably extinct in the 1420s, carbon dating reveals they disappeared way before this period though the story of them being discovered by sailors is certainly entertaining.  I think this fact could be disputed.  The Falkland Island dogs related to Chinese edible dogs?  Extraordinary, need to know more.    2. A document from the 1420s at Cambridge showing animals and cultures of the world could not show Sikhs as Sikhism is post 1500.    3. The trinity of Buddhism is Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, not Buddha, Dhamma and meditation.    I find it problematic that so much seems to have been done in just 3 years or less 1421-1423 after which it was kaput.  Darwin took 5 years and then a lifetime to put his ideas together.  As Menzies himself explains, the Chinese probably got to the Americas before the 1420s and any cultural evolution took place in S. America over decades (The Chinese monk apparently reached S. America in the 5th Century CE).  The time frames need a bit more explanation.    The historical contexts supplied by Menzies e.g. about the Portuguese are wonderful.  What if the Chinese had not destroyed their navy?  I am now reasonably assured that Chinese probably got to Australia and many other parts of the world.  From the Zoological and Botanical vantages I want to know more.  I look forward to reading similar books to work out how much of this book can be taken seriously.    I cannot easily know of the truths about Menzies claims of various Chinese navigators and their exact itinaries.    I belive Mr Menzies as a navigator and he makes sailing round the world sound so simple, based on stars, the sun or compass and currents that seem to waft you from one place to another.    It is well written with Menzies' wife's money paying for so much research.  He has voiced some powerful hidden scholarship that scholars responsible have hitherto hid under a barrel.  I think this book is an accomplishment of enormous effort and the author deserves congratulations despite the books' flaws.	2004-04-08

Even the Indians had no idea of their own history.  The British Orientalists started the unravelling of a complex puzzle that revealed the buried secrets of ancient India, emperor Asoka and Buddhism.  Allen's book reveals this stunning tale.<br />This is very much an unfinished story with more leads than Allen explores but he has related how the keys to the history of India were discovered via Burma and Sri Lanka in deciphering the Brahmi script and making sense of mysterious pillars that dotted the Indian landscape.<br />This book is also of great interest from the archaelogical angle.  Far more has been found in terms of buildings, ruins and places actually frequented by the Buddha than of Jesus though many scholars still ignore the physical evidence about the Buddha and pretend we only know him from oral traditions.  In fact, undoubted relics of the Buddha after his cremation have also been found as detailed in this book.  Allen indicates how recorded pilgrimages by Chinese monks lead to the rediscovery of lost monasteries, caves and the ancient city of Pataliputra.<br />Allen also details the history of Buddhist scholarship in the 19th century and how missionaries and their influences both dogged and abetted researches and a revival in Buddhism.<br />Allen's work will interest historians, archaeologists, linguists and those interested in Buddhism.  There is a great deal more to be done in terms of archaeology, translation and reconstructing Indian history from the fifth century BCE and this book is an ideal launching pad.

About two chapters on the Aztecs and the fall of Tenochtitlan.  Similarly about the Incas and the end of their rebellion.  Then a chapter on the discovery of the Amazon.  Another on Spanish explorer Cabeza De Vaca and finally on how the Spanish conquest lead to a human rights debate.<br />The paintings and illustrations are in colour.  The writing is warm, gripping and balanced - A BBC style expose of what was going on (by an underrated BBC TV program) with its brillian author presenter.<br />If you don't have a clue about how S. America was stolen, this book takes you to the thick of it.  To the vanquishing of two entire civilisations and an incomparable destruction by &quot;civilised&quot; Spaniards crazy about gold and converts to Christianity as a pretext for enslaving and abusing their conquered victims.<br />He sticks to the most important details, the massacres, what made the conquistadors tick?, the heroism, bravery and about confronting &quot;The Other&quot; - a titanic clash of cultures.  What indeed could have happened if the Chinese got there first as Woods ruefully inquires?<br />This book I hope will show Latin Americans in particular the importance of replacing something lost though it can never be regained.  Perhaps Mexico city should be given back its original name.<br />I'd love to have seen a better illustration or two of Tenochtitlan but it is now all gone anyway.<br />This book is a celebration of those lost golden civilisations with a penchant for human sacrifice.	2004-02-05

They ask for our money through media channels and tell us how much good they do and how many people they can save with our help.<br />Yet these NGOs are barely accountable to their donors and may never reveal the truth about the extent, scope and definitions of their activities.  They compromise the \\"sovereign\\" status of several nations, are patronising, neo colonial and missionary in scope and don't help a great deal of the time.  They are also handmaidens to rich Western countries giving them plenty of excuses not to be decisive or reasons to justify covert operations dressed as humanitarianism.<br />David Rief exposes all this with passion and gusto speaking as a journalist who has lived through the situations he describes and has had first hand contact with the UN and some of the aid organisations emanating from the USA and Europe he mentions.<br />Academics and others will disagree but this book is shocking, illuminating and deeply revealing.  It is a first step in making NGOs accountable under rigorous standards to donors and receivers.  More, much more is needed in this vein and this book is the tip of an iceberg.<br />This pioneering work has confirmed some of my worst fears, particularly about one or two named organisations.  A must for all those who support charities and wish to be informed about how your aid may be used or abused and how to stay skeptical of the claims humanitarian relief organisations make for themselves.	2003-09-10

Fuller's recent book \\"The Dodo from extinction to icon (UK)\\".  From a scholarly vantage it fails utterly.    Firstly the book is quite parochial dwelling at great length on issues very distant from the dodo such as Portuguese navigation and ignoring the fact that the dodo was painted in India completely.  The book makes extraordinary claims like \\"Why do we know so much about what the dodo looked like?\\" when the text itself makes clear we know very little and makes tremendous claims on behalf of R. Savery, (a relatively poor artist of animals) in the context of his contribution to Western art - why.  The best thing about Savery was he did several pictures of the dodo unlike many other artists though Savery's dodos cannot be trusted for accuracy.    Most of the facts in the book such as the numbers of dodo's that arrived in Europe or how much contact R. Savery had with the dodo are either speculative or from doubtful sources.  Though references are copious, some important references are not taken up and there is an over reliance on secondary sources.  Much of the content it must be said is therefore presumptious.    There are some new translations such as descriptions by Clusius on the dodo's head, but there is little primary material of relevance in a critical style on the dodo itself.    As a celebration of the iconic place of the dodo and the history of the period and the Mascarenes this book has some claims, but you'd be better off reading Fuller.  As there are so few good books on the Dodo I think this book is a reasonable start and the author has written it with enthusiasm.	2003-09-10

But if you found a book about dinosaurs that said \\"we know almost nothing about them, except that there are no dinosaurs today\\" would you be interested?  This is how Fuller starts his commentary on the dodo - \\"We know almost nothing....\\"  dodos equal famous dinosaurs.  The moral of the whole book is, \\"here are the facts but we don't really know and we can't either so there\\".  In its attempt to be critical and parsimonious, it trips over itself in a mess of contradictions (was the Dodo grey or brown? - \\"it seems to have been greyish though Saftleven clearly shows the head was brown\\")and a script that reads like watery thin soup.    The fact of the matter is, there is a lot of background interest in the Dodo and this book does not dare to speculate on various assumptions and models that have been made of the Dodo.  For example that it may have shed the tip of its bill, that it produced chicks every 2 years or on any differences between males and females of a specific nature.  The paintings of the Dodo are not discussed critically in terms of authorship and attribution or history.  We don't get to hear about where a few dodos were sent alive and how they contributed to paintings.  The map of Mauritius does not clearly mark the spot where lots of dodo skeletons turned up and the general distribution of dodos.  Fuller leaves us guessing if dodos lived on the interior of the island or coasts and whether it was a forest or shore type bird.    In the end, the book is more like a log of evidence and we are left to pick out our own picture for ourselves.  The author has very little conscious, critical or thought provoking to say.  There is too much on dodo paraphanelia/souvnirs as well.    It is in fact more disappointing than his other books on extinct birds like the Great Auk.  A lot more could have been said and done.  This book remains a vital reference on the Dodo with holes, unapologetic omissions and scientific coyness.    Its price is good and it remains a reference - on the dodo, the Solitare and the mysterious \\"White dodo\\" though there isn't much of a story here.	2003-03-11

Each essay is sophisticated with lots of sources quoted and the book also has good pictures.  It is a concise work and as an edition on Tchaikovsky to be treasured, for it succeeds in embellishing the composer at a critical level, without being a eulogy of him or his music.<br />Of greatest interest are the essays by Poznansky on Tchaikovsky himself.  We are treated to the most intimate details of his sexuality (not all this material was destroyed it seems by his brother) though the treatment is unsalacious and full of objectivity if not humour.  These facts emerge from previously untranslated or hitherto unreleased material and represent the latest material emerging about his life.  Poznansky shows us that homosexuality at the time was not as much a problem as it is supposed to have been, and that people then were more or less as people are now - not less enlightened in any sense.  Attitudes on morality may have shifted since then, but there was also that much more discretion on such matters at the time.<br />Poznansky unravels the mystery surrounding Tchaikovsky's death authoritatively and though conspiracy theories will still abound, I think the matter is laid to rest.<br />This is also a celebration of Russia and the greatest flowering of its art and culture, not to mention music under Tchaikovsky.  We get treated to essays on Russian painting with some fine copies of the works described, the coronation of the Tsar and on writers like Chekov.<br />This book is also (along with Poznansky's essays), a psychological dissection into roles of gender in history and myth, with one especially good essay \\"Tchaikovsky Androgyne\\".  There are also some good essays on musical theory.<br />Expertly edited, this is a study in scholarship, presentation and warm intelligence.  Tchaikovsky emerges unscathedand as grand as ever to those who have sought to know him and his muse.	2002-11-20

Before welfare systems, all cultures had master servant relationships as the rich employed servants.  The master servant relationship was stark in colonial Africa.  The masters had to know the natives so that they could get work out of them and a certain amount of loyalty but the masters in Africa also had to keep the natives down, almost like animals, so that they could remain the masters and the servants could remain servants.<br />The natives of course as servants, could also benefit as underdogs as all servants do, being loyal, friendly and pleasing but not above their masters.  Mary in the book, starts with preconceptions about her relationship to the Africans, and as things get from bad to worse, she if faced with a mistress servant relationship going horribly wrong.<br />Her husband is a fool, tied to the land and unable to organise his ambitions or get anything out of his farm.  She knows better, but luck is never on their side.  One actually has a respect for Mary and her penetrative intelligence, but the book describes how this very human intelligence with its stiff attitudes (she marries when she understands people are sniggering about her behind her back, in any case, women at the time did not have much choice in this), breaks down, collapses utterly.<br />Harrowing, hot hot weather with the dry beauty of Africa described by a veteran.  This is a book that unravels in your hand and is a literary masterpiece for a first novel.<br />Lessing describes herself as a colonist and is known to be unconventional and vaguely feminist.  She displays a keen erudition of the issues, language and sights of her once native Africa - and brings it home.	2002-11-20

It is about the men who commanded the NW Indian territories on behalf of the East India Company and principally about one hero called John Nicholson.  Despite the subtitle, this book is a great deal more than short biographic narratives about the men.  It is the seam of their environment that provides half the interest consisting of geographical descriptions, the attitudes of Indians and how the British and \\"Indians\\" conducted their business.    There are some gripping accounts of bloody battles on horseback, with bits being chopped off and we can see that films like Gladiator are the tip of the iceberg when it came to hand to hand horseback combat before the 20th century.  The men and horses were brave and some of them knew what they wanted and how to get it.  This is particularly true in how the violent Pakhtun tribes in Pakistan were bought to heel.  As aliens, the British succeeded in creating order (as they were neutral) between parties like Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus who could easily foment religious rivalry between themselves.  The British had an art to how they brought about law and order and we can see it was no small accomplishment.    There is a certain amount of bigotry and imperialism in operation which is quite clear, but these were the days before the British became complacent and divorced themselves from Indian culture at the beginnings of the 20th century, which eventually created the independence movement that lead to partition.    Sikhs today feel left out of a homeland that was owed to them by the British.  This is a book that shows how loyal Sikhs were to the British and the background to their territorial claims.    Charles Allen is a fine author and this book deserves praise.  The war in it and many quotations make the book quite gripping and one hopes some people today are made of the same stuff as certain aspects of the men described- though not all of those aspects.	2002-11-20

Well after the dinosaurs were the hunter gatherers, then Sumerians, Egypt, Indus Valley, China, Greeks, Romans, the dark ages, the Rennaisance, global naval exploration and conquest, the industrial revolution, the British Empire and the modern status quo.  Even a Chinese student I spoke to knows more about the Greeks than his own history.<br />History has too often been dominated by a Eurocentric world view.  The victors write history in their own image, and it is this history that becomes a global commodity.<br />Clive Ponting has teased out a different perspective which is somewhat Sinocentric, concentrating on China, India, the Ottomans and much relegated societies and civilisations mostly wiped out or exterpated by European expansion, notably in the Americas.  Only after 1750, Ponting argues was the stage set for European expansion on the back of New World gold, silver and a plantation industry based on slavery, buying into well established Eurasian trading networks which were eventually taken over.<br />We can be critical.  Europe as a continent, Ponting argues is Geographic bonhomie.  He calls it the Western Eurasian periphery.  There are no major individuals he highlights and he rather describes a flow of events which are highly critical of so called European advances and their religious systems, subsequently imposed on much of the world.  Perhaps the new perspective is a little jaundiced and opinionated.  Indeed, one critic has argued (a scholar I spoke to on this) that this work would have been better written by an Asian than a European being critical of his &quot;own kind&quot;.<br />But there is much of value on Chinese history in particular that other world histories have not taken into account, mainly as the Chinese are very good at holding back from imposing their culture on others unlike the Occident.  This book is also an environmental perspective to acertain extend, indicating how much of civilisation is based on pleasant environmental circumstances which can change bringing disaster, such as past mini ice ages and changes caused by deforestation (Coming from the author of a green global history, a first).<br />I think there is much to provoke the mind in this which relates a different history to conventional accounts.  It must be said that modern authoritative accounts have picked up on the new perspective.  Especially good for Chinese readers and other Asians who want to see things from a non Occidental vantage.<br />Gripping stuff once started.	2002-09-16

Not because Buddhism is spreading - globally it isn't and the slower it grows the better according to one teacher.  But because some people have aspired to the highest goodness they can muster based on their own efforts, common sense and intelligence.

The book then descends to a ramble about why you have to be cruel to be kind.<br />Though I could see some valid points against animal rightists he then took it to extremes.  \\"Every boy has not lived who has not pulled a trigger\\" I paraphrase.

Skilful means was a technique employed by the Buddha to enable his disciples to awaken, or to be saved from danger which relied on bribes, inducements, threats or half truths - just as a parent may employ on a young child.  For example, once the Buddha promised one of his monks divine nymphs if he would meditate - eventually after that monk awoke, the Buddha was freed from his promise.  What if the entire often complex teaching of the Buddha was skilful means, merely a complex advertisement or device to draw people in - given they would only truly comprehend reality after they had themselves pierced the veil?  What if the teaching had no inherent truth at all?    This work tackles not so much compassion or even Skilful Means (Upaya) but the Buddhist attitude towards view and whether Buddhism makes any empirical statements of truth that go beyond a soteriological function.  It spans the spectrum of Buddhism in its search for the development of Upaya, emphasised in the Mahayana approach.    Of the four \\"heretical\\" teachers in the Pali Canon, Sanjaya Belatthaputta was caricatured as an extreme sceptic.  Asked e.g., \\"is the world eternal?\\" he replied using the fourfold logic: I don't say (i)it is, (ii)it isn't, (iii) it's both yes and no, nor (iv)it's neither yes nor no.  The Buddha is reputed to have asked \\"Does this apply to your own philosophy?\\"  One problem that the student will face is that Buddhism itself appears to have aspects of this \\"eel wriggling\\" approach.  Schroeder argues, reiterating the famous simile on the raft, that the bulk of the scriptures could be seen as little more than skilful means with no essential propositions.  Whereas Schroeder confines his argument to the realms of Buddhist philosophy and meditation, the idea can extend to our experience of reality and attempts at its reification.  There is nothing especially new in this Upayic approach to Buddhism though what begins like the re-invention of the wheel is quickly superseded by the ramifications of this idea and how it affects our understanding of the teaching.  Schroeder is at pains to be modest stating that the book itself does not represent another skilful means.    The author deepens his approach by clarifying the concept of conventional truth vs ultimate truth that was again enlarged by the Mahayana schools.  One highlight of the book is Schroeder's analysis of the old Abhidhamma approach representing a matrix of postulates on the functioning of mind and meditation; in particular the description of the arising and ceasing of mind moments within a temporal frame.  According to the Sarvastivadins, says Schroeder, the character of the mind moments changed but the essential underlying substance of experience svabhava remained.  The Sautrantika's rejected this as it admitted of a self or atman, but replaced it by stating that only the present is real and that moments arise and cease into nothing.  These arguments encapsulate a paradox found in any search for \\"ultimate truth\\".  The latter scheme denies causation by ignoring past conditions and the mechanism of present conditioning.  Nagarjuna and later schools tackled this problem by expanding the concepts of emptiness in phenomena leading to non-duality, important in Zen.    We are taken from the Abhidhamma approach through Vimalakirti and Nagarjuna to Zen including a little on Pure Land.  Each tradition in succession seem in part a one-upmanship of the previous approach, trying at each turn to avoid the impression of clinging to theories and external forms.  The author incorporates elements of Western philosophy and metaphysics into a narrative that is pithy yet engaging and fairly comprehensive.  Schroeder is critical of occidental interpretations of Nagarjuna as a philosopher and metaphysician independent of a soteriological aspect.  This is important as more will probably be written on Indian philosophy in the West than ever before.  Several scholarly works are cited though a few seem questionable.Schroeder's unfamiliarity with ancient Buddhism is somewhat betrayed in his assertions e.g., that the fire worshippers the Buddha gave the Fire Sermon to (headed by Uruvela Kassapa) \\"ritually burnt their own flesh\\" when there is no precedent that the then fire-worshippers did this.  He also mentions the Buddha to be with the five ascetics who \\"once lived in the mountains\\".  In this light, Schroeder's analysis of the Abhidhamma approach to Theravada in terms of \\"seven stages of purification\\" may be too fixed belying the diversity of teachings then available.  The original Buddhism was not Theravada and traditions can only be defined by comparison to alternatives and due to degrees of sometimes unfortunate polarisation to retain integrity.    This academic though accessible book, rich in quotation remains somewhat inconclusive at the end though it can be seen that the concept of Upaya in the sense of an absence of fixed teachings probably existed in all traditions.  It will be an invaluable reference and an entertaining read about what the teaching is not.  Perhaps the work could have been rounded off to indicate what Buddhism therefore does amount to and how it may critically hinge on the learner's state of mind.  E.g. When questioned about the Buddha's views and those of his disciples the layman Anathapindaka admits ignorance but does explain his own view (Anguttara Nikaya X.93).  To present Buddhism as merely Upaya could simply entrap us in another view.  The teaching is a means to truth and involves a grounding in skilled qualities of mind like love, energy, concentration, equanimity, emphasised by the Buddha several times - perhaps these qualities could have been scrutinised to see if they represented nouns or verbs.  If they are to be seen as clunky beliefs or potential wings to freedom.	2002-03-04

This book tells his story.<br /><br />American books speaking of Buddhism start with Vietnam, the Beat Generation, Hippies and Ajhan Chah as a brief history of the religion in the USA.  Actually, this history should be extended all the way back to the 1860s and specifically to Olcott, one of the first converts to Buddhism.  The 1880s were very significant.<br /><br />He established the Theosphical society with Helena Blavatsky and moved from Spiritualism to Egyptian religions before settling on a lifelong affair with Oriental religions after a vision he had.<br /><br />Having moved to India, he established and bolstered movements battling against missionaries, swamping the native cultures and generated an anti missionary toolbox based on their own methods.  These succeeded.  He also established strings of Buddhist schools in Sri Lanka and empowered Hinduism and native Indian religions including Islam through his Theosophical journals which actually turned a profit.  He also attempted to unify the Buddhist world by harbouring links with Japan.  What is surprising is that so much of what he put his efforts into bore fruit.<br /><br />This book exposes this little known American hero (to some)and the creolised religious response he initiated.  The book is highly critical and well researched.<br /><br />At a time when the USA is exporting Christian Evangelism, Olcott was the exception who exported something else and influenced the European Theosophical movement and seekers in ancient systems of knowledge.<br /><br />An invaluable and rare reference of a little known indomitable figure.	2002-01-22

This book was a major explicator of all these themes.<br />The book's greatest highlight for me was a precis on Kant's philosophy and how it linked with Schopenhauer's eventual world view.  The concepts of phenomena and noumena are well explained, and there is a brilliant vision of the occidental philosophical grasp of reality in the romantic era.  Certainly, these German philosphers were brilliant and sufficiently detached to transcend their cultural outlook and fly over it.<br />To me the book did not wade deeply enough into Nietzche and Schopenhauer but this was obviously not the author's objective and his treatments though non voluminous are comprehensive.  On the other hand the book is also a eulogy of Wagner and was certainly a bit subjective as the author pours over some of the operas and gives a great deal of over zealous details, which a reader unfamiliar with the stuff may want to pass over in preference to actually getting the CD (telling us what to buy would have spared most of the description).<br />The author uses the book as a stage from which to demolish Wagner's neo-Nazi credentials and he gives the low down as to why Nietzche abandoned Wagner, using the composer to enhance Nietzche's reputation at the same time as ridiculing the composer later on.<br />Whether Wagner was really that philosophical compared to any other great composer (the philosophical interests of which are less known) as the author contends is debatable.  That the composer drew on the finest German philosophy and myth available to him is not in doubt.  My own impression is that Wagner was a sort of Walt Disney (leaving aside the former's compositional genius which Walt probably needed more of) who cherry picked using his tremendous intelligence all the finest resonances of German culture, poetry and the new religions emerging and transformed them to music that all people would be moved by.  Wagner appears to have been deeply religious though how sincere this was is another matter.  He did worship Schopenhauer and appears to have been eternally grateful to his Eastern world renouncing ideas.  Wagner succeeded better than any other composer in fulfilling his wildest dreams amd ambitions and being able to awe the public in his very lifetime.  The secret of some of this success is revealed in this great book.	2001-12-02

It can be finished in two hours flat or around that and contained an astonishing wealth of material including much I did not know. There are such tantalising leads set up about the man, and a voluminous set of follow up sources, but the book itself is turgid.<br />One can be overwhelmed by the amazing range of material and the author does not choose between the plausible and the implausible. Rather he generates a riotous though coherent account combining many sources, treating all the myth with the same deference as the facts (makes a refreshing change). Importantly, he edits and chooses his material well, sectioning the book and ignoring swathes of the Buddha's life from his middle period (when the order of events is obscure).<br />This is not a biography but a gripping narrative. A sort of splash in the face about an individual, sufficiently admired to have generated so many stories, from the Bodhisatva stages (where the author starts and dwells on- again, very novel)to the nuances of what actually happened as he lay between the Sal trees at Kusinara. One feels the impact of an immense being, and is left fairly breathless and wishing more.<br />Perhaps a longer book with more historical background could have helped.

In the same series as the Helm ID guides to bird families, a series that is apparently beating Handbook of Birds of the World in being the first to catalogue Passerines in detail this book like others in the series apparently offers a breadth of coverage including illustrations and species accounts but the volume is seriously flawed compared to all the rest.<br />It has chosen to avoid references to food and feeding except where considered essential to illustrate a point of habit.  For a book that could never be used as a field guide as it is more taxonomic in coverage rather than geographical, this omission represents a grave error by the publishers.  All the other volumes cover details of food and I can only say that the authors were lazy.  They have no excuse.<br />They seem to think we the readers already know that warblers are insectivorous, but this fact is not really stated in the introduction to compensate for the omission.  Hence this book is more a taxonomic list, not a monograph of the family.  It perhaps ignores breeding as well (I was researching them for food details) - very very disappointing for a large group of birds not adequately covered elsewhere at the time of writing.	2001-10-20

So what is the best edition of this tremendous work upon which hyperbole could fail?<br />Dorothy Sayers rendered the work into a stylistically matched slightly archaic version in three volumes through Penguin Classics.  These volumes have the advantage of dedication from the author, a Christian with a precision of language and handy illustrations and extensive notes.<br />I found Mark Musa's versions simpler and less poetic (he refused to imitate the rhythms as Sayers had attempted) and scholars may have their own favourite version.<br />But for people on the go, who would like it all in one the radio (BBC) recommended the translation by C. H. Sisson with notes by Higgins published under World's Classics which may also feature as Oxford World's Classics around 1993.<br />This contains practically all the elements a reader will need including figures and illustrations mapping the voyage and notes on the history and context.

That such a catchy idea came from what was effectively an off the shelf best seller with no literary pretentions indicates just what a fun and fascinating read it presents, especially for a young man who wishes a read encapsulating the perfect specimen of womankind.<br />This particular edition is good for it contains an excellent introduction by Professor D. Karlin with extensive and helpful notes. Karlin makes it clear that the book is a sort of fantasy within a fantasy and the joke is usually on us. It's contents are so &quot;out there&quot; that the author is at pains to state &quot;every word is true&quot; through his chosen first person mouthpiece, and he adds several details that makes the book's events plausible while you are in it.<br />The book is a masterpiece of archetypes including the Anima, acient civilization and archaeology, exploration, hunting and Africa as she used to be. It further represents the last mysterious possibilities that could be squeezed out of a world whose potential to amaze was fast disappearing due to the advent of transport and exploration. It is an old fashioned Indiana Jones type epic with explorers making a big discovery that could shake the British Empire to its very core.<br />The elements come from Haggard's own association and love of Africa (he includes the extinct Quagga one of the descriptions)<br />and his contact with an angelic woman with whom his fascination was was not satiated as he was married already. There is a great deal of swashbuckling adventure hived off from Livingstone, Egyptology, linguistics, classics and history as well of prevailing views and outlooks - but all this is eventually fused in a saga that is anything but boring in the same dynamic and suspensive style of bestsellers of the time (serialised in popular magazines) as S. Holmes and Jules Verne.<br />Needless to say, the book is over the top even for that time and is a literary equivalent of Jurassic Park, taken up by everyone but academia and the gatekeepers of high culture.<br />The subtext has disturbing and provocative elements which could by identified as mysoginy, soft porn and the frustrated psyche of the average young male at the time. She is destroyed in the end and provides the perfect excuse for both the principal male protagonists to give up women.<br />Haggard himself has recently been discovered to have had a secret relationship which bore him an illegitimate child and we also realise he was not really an imperialist and supported free tendencies for Africans in the shadow of imperialism. He predicted the inevitable independence of African states and the imperial overtones in the book should not be misread as jingoistic.<br />For people too rushed to pour over Trollope or Dickens, this is Victoriana at its greatest with many interesting contemporary themes including the theory of evolution which reads extremely fast. It is a window into history and an ultimate fantasy exploring the sources of life and immortality itself and represents something made in a hurry in the &quot;white heat&quot; of the author's anvil. A performance he probably never repeated.<br />Absorbing, mysterious and shocking - some people will find it unravels a great deal of their innermost tendencies and sexuality into the limelight of coherence and myth.amic and suspensive style of bestsellers of the time (serialised in popular magazines) as S.

The author heads for the Himalayan heights to seek out the elusive and precious mountain cat with the eminent mammalogist Schaller.  Matthiessen writes of the mountains there and the grand hospitality from Nepal and hermits on their mountain retreats and the book harks back to elements of his wife's death and explorations of what life involves.  He analyses the lives and manners of the people he encounters and describes the ruggedness of mountain climbing marrying together endurance with views, storms and tales of blue sheep and the mythical Yeti.

The Digha Nikaya was apparently the first portion of the Pali Canon to be recited after the Buddha's passing and contains some of his most important discourses. This book compresses all 30 odd discourses (suttas) into a relatively slim volume compared to the original with its repetitions which would run into tens of volumes.<BR>The only alternative to this edition which is reputable is still probably Rhys David's translation for the PTS in 3 volumes which is actually good but archaic, harder and pricier to get hold of.<BR>Walshe's translation reads easily and his notes are quite chatty but a few of his comments could have been avoided. The Buddha comes across as quite human is his speech and earnest in conveying something to his listeners (the English is highly readable and fairly simple as opposed to older and archaic rendering), commanding as usual but cool and detached with a tremendous sense of compassion.<BR>More abstruse passages within certain suttas will not be understood by most readers without meditation practice or guidance from teachers and the book itself lacks sufficient explanation, in fact some elements of the translation may be wrong or mis-interpretted.<BR>This book is a boon companion for anyone who feels s/he needs the highest security.<BR>Most of the suttas here are applicable to lay people as well as monks (the usual audience the Buddha addressed) and this volume contains seminal discourses such as 1. The Great Discourse on the foundations of mindfulness, 2. The discourse of the Great decease of the Buddha and 3. Fruits of the homeless life. There are many others such as one specifically as to how lay-people should live and guard their worldly affairs and at least two dealing with gods or conversations with celestial beings.<BR>I think this book represents an excellent reference for the price and can be read aloud when you are alone. Profound, mysterious, to the heart and yet sometimes extreme or humourous. As Nyanaponika says (the late) &quot;Mr Walshe has done an excellent job&quot;.	2001-09-23

What I don't like is that the book is heavily biased towards cladism and treatment of snake groups seems to be somewhat haphazard and poorly organised.  Words like Uropeltidae do not occur in the index.  Many groups are hard to find except using the genus rank and the accounts even for genera are sometimes scattered and the text is chatty though sometimes rambling.  This is not an introduction to snakes and its target audience seems rather eclectic (beginners, experts or people inbetween?).<br />I am disappointed that traditional groupings and classifications have been totally ignored which makes this work hard to cross-reference against older works which do have those groups.  The author does not propose his own system based on Linnean ranks or for that matter a well annotated cladogram (there is a rather abstract one at the front).<br />Undoubtedly informative, I feel that serpents and those interested in them have been descriptively let down, coming from an acknowledged expert.  More warmth and better organisation could have helped as in the standard of such works as \\"Handbook of Birds of the World - Lynx Edicions\\".	2001-07-26

Whereas I looked forwards to the book's delivery, I think the content does not represent a sufficiently incisive account.  It will be useful, especially to non Buddhists.<br />I was struck by the lack of any substantial acknowledgements or bibiliography; there are however extensive notes.  It is true that the book is written in a style reminicent of pre-modern explorations by westerners who had made a somewhat initial contact with this teaching.  It represents a good occidental overview (rational, liberal) and Armstrong thus overlays the narrative with the stamp of her own perceptions.<br />For criticism, a few of her points need improvement, e.g. the statement that Buddhas arise every 32,000 years in the main text is quite wrong.  As for Armstrong's interpretation of Buddhism based on feminist principles, I think she is misleading.  The Buddha was very good at being stubborn to requests like the one that women should be allowed to ordain (amongst other unrelated requests e.g. please teach the dhamma!).  He was merely creating a precedent being traditionally aware that previous Buddhas had had nuns' assemblies.  Buddhism was the first main religion to admit women unlike many other religions and the social context in India cannot be filtered in the context of recent western movements (which are a reaction to previous attitudes to women in the West which the East did not necessarily share (assumptions can be loaded)).  In fact, a close study of Buddhist texts shows women had a far stronger standing in India at the time, than women of ancient Greece or Rome (and India at a later phase) and in any case the texts abound with the names of famous female disciples and their conversations etc with the Buddha from eminent nuns to queens, courtezans, noble women and servants.  Furthermore, the women of Buddhist countries like Sri Lanka and Burma have never really been treated as second class citizens to any extent as in other cultures from ancient times.  Armstrong tends to ignore any archaeological evidence supporting the historcity of the Buddha such as the discovery of relics (though the questioning of the existence of a historical personage can be seen as the greatest compliment) and as a final criticism, some of the nuances she applies to the Dhamma such as overcoming the ego can make the issue sound a little simplistic.<br />On the other hand I think the author has been brave to use Pali text rather than the Sanskrit versions and this an innovation.  The other reviews pick up further good points of this short, warm and sympathetic account.  Armstrong writes as a caring and sensitive person and her character and exploration do shine through.  She's obviously put a lot of thought into the book and worked well within the deadline for its issue on top of her educative and media life!<br />For more critical reads which are just as easy consider: The Buddha by Michael Carruthers in the Oxford, A very short introduction series and The Buddha by Michael Pye (Duckworth - sadly out of print a brilliant and critical study as recommended in the Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy).e never really been treated as second class citizens to any extent as in other cultures from ancient times.

The text is well sectioned with good maps and useful information, notes and an extensive bibliography that makes the work substantive (e.g., it highlights the wider territory of ostriches in the past).  Xuanzang becomes a portal through which we view the art and history of a predominantly Buddhist India before she entered a chaotic phase to re-emerge as a Mughal and Hindu civilisation later.<br />There is staggering insight into the mentality of the Chinese and Kings at the time and the art they bestowed on the world.  The importance of the Chinese civilisation is highlighted at a time when Europe was in the grip of the dark ages.<br />The book contains minor errors, could have been more critical and Xuanzang's feet on the cover need alteration.  Leaving this aside, there is a stunning picture from Bamiyan and we can see what was lost as well as related paintings and statues which are quite exquisite (at least one of them lost from the Kabul museum since the destructive episode recently).  <br />A book worth treasuring as written by a professional, well travelled and strong minded author (and she found the time).	2001-05-12

Written in the same genre as &quot;Why big fierce animals are rare&quot; (better - please no sentimentality in such material) though in the footsteps of Robert Bakker and possibly Gould or Gribbin or other popular writers, this book is very informative though it could have been more critical and less informal.<br />It is actually a somewhat original account summarising the latest news from the Mesozoic dwelling on dinosaurs, size, energetics, evolution and the author's fear of the amalgamation of biodiversity.<br />The illustrations highlight characters from the history of vertebrate evolution and the book is a send off for elephants, flightless birds, some extinct and extant reptiles.<br />I wish the last chapeter could have been curtailed with a more general overview of our impact on the biosphere and that the author could sound less philanthropic in his intentions.<br />I think the work will be much cited (I will anyway) and though he leans to warm blooded dinosaurs this could be a mistake.  Excellent as a macrotaxonomic survey in the vertebrates on physiologic lines, more, much more needs to be said e.g., on secondary palates, body shape, insulation, food sources, plants, past climates.

It is in this respect a rare overview of a vanished colonial past with only remnants today to vindicate former prestige.  As someone who has lived in tea estates in Sri Lanka during vacations, I can testify to their beauty and how much more lavish things could have been when their founding masters were on their thrones.<br />Following hot on the heels of Rebecca released in 1938, the book seems to incorporate several elements in it.  The main character in Rebecca is passively swept away by a husband with a fabulous mansion which happens to have a rather haughty and overbearing housekeeper.  In Elephant walk the female protagonist actively pursues the rich planter in a manipulative courtship which by far is one of the most interesting phases of the book in the beginning.  She enters a strange oversized mansion in Sri Lanka with a degree of profligacy as in Rebecca in the diversity of its overspend having to face a haughty house keeper zealously attached to maintaining tradition.  As in Rebecca, the mansion is destroyed at the end.<br />During colonial times the phenomenon of the bored housewife while the husband went to work was well known and has been fictionally documented by Kipling, Forster (perhaps) and factually in such books as the Fall of the British Empire by C. Cross.  This book makes a great play on this phenomenon bringing in an affair with the assistant planter who is tragically separated from the heroin by the Great War.<br />The interest in the book following the opening courtship lies chiefly in highlighting elements of colonial life that have not really been documented such as how the planters lived, held meetings, their food, drinks, amusements and about the imported coolies from South India.  It also describes how such plantations were carved out of pristine wilderness, now hanging on to existence by the skin of its teeth, thanks to such colonial encroachments and their ramifications.  Almost all montane elephants in Sri Lanka have since been displaced.<br />The love story in the book is quite weak and the structure of the plot is not especially sophisticated or well woven.  But the author has put in a lot of effort which shows and this book makes a good read.<br />The book was after all turned into a film with Liz Taylor which probably made it into a best seller at the time and it is probably better than the film.<br />All in all Elephant Walk is an often sensitive portrayal of heavy memories and facts that one can usually only imagine rather than recreate.  It represents the impact and opulence of lifestyles in aspects of Bristish colonialism before the 1950's in Sri Lanka from a contemporary source.	2001-03-02

His philosophy and system of development is hard to pin down.  It contains austerities, rituals, magic and astrology as well as a melange of theoretical and rational teachings designed to awaken the individual from a mechanistic state that we are all unwittingly embroiled in.  Ouspensky was one of Gurdjieff's foremost pupils and this book is a succinct presentation of all of Gudjieff's major teachings.<br />The book should be a revelation to the receptive beginner by which is meant someone not satisfied with conventional modes of knowing and understanding and above all conventional solutions to what are ultimately unconventional problems.  His teachings apparently have their roots in Sufism and other magical systems but have a very close parallel to Buddhism, notably mindfulness or \\"Self remembrance\\" as a method of waking up.  People familiar with esoteric methods will find much to celebrate in this book.<br />The book is also biographic and traces Gurdjieff and his students' departure from the old Russian Empire at the time of the revolution during the First World War.  A time of crisis that adds to his teachings.  The book finally marks a point of departure between G and Ouspensky.<br />Gurdjieff was not a great writer and his teachings are best represented by his pupils except for the specialists who could actually wade through G's own writings like Beelzebub's Tails which is rather complex and abstruse.  He approved Ouspensky's primary rendition which this book represents.  Whereas Ouspensky does not possibly convey the great warmth that G possessed, this book is the best starting point for a beginner compared to more modern biographic commentaries.  Further interest can be added to by an excellent series of books summarising G's teachings in the form of collected talks (by his students) published by Arkarna Penguin (e.g. Meetings with remarkable men on G's formative years).	2001-02-18

One of the authors being Sinhalese (which is also a language close to Pali)would have better understood the meanings and senses of terms more than most Western scholars, and the joint authorship suggests a polished and balanced approach to attain near perfection.<br />No translation can articulate the experiential meanings behind the verses or hope to equal the ancient meanings.  But this one gets close representing an honest attempt at a challenging goal.  The English may appear somewhat academic but this is a thoroughly modern translation and OUP have done their homework in bestowing authorship.<br />The publisher is to be congratulated and this book deserves the shelf of any good library.	2001-01-27

This book scores well on all points and above all reads like an essay which you can zap through.  <br />It contains a good bibliography for follow up reading and includes details of the the award winning &quot;Journal of Buddhist ethics&quot; on the web which was partly established by the author.  Apart from the author's erudition his book is backed up by other experts and has been reviewed by his students.<br />Above all the book analyses what is meant by religion (as Buddhism does not easily fit this classification) and provides a modern interpretation of this system of thought from all its major perspectives.  The treatment of Mahayana Buddhism short, yet precise and on the whole Keown concentrates on highlights.  Towards the end is a discussion on Buddhism in the West.  The book also provides useful comparisons with other religions.<br />Compared to many small and &quot;cheap&quot; introductions to Buddhism, this book is fairly impeccable. It is not perfect (2 tiny errors I identified with regards to scriptural quotations) but will lead anyone interested to work out what Buddhism is for him or herself, rather than being spoon fed as it were.  I was however, disappointed that the book ended so fast - and glad at the follow up leads left, by this trustworthy writer.	2001-01-26

According to Buddhist teachings, these powers are accessible to those who can perfect their concentration.  Apart from including biographies of some individuals credited with the above sorts of psychic abilities, it also has equally gripping accounts of the more ordinary aspects of these and many other disciples of the Buddha most of whom became enlightened.  It is thus an account of the principal individuals after the Buddha who were supposed to have finished everything that needs accomplishing with no further burdens or debts to pay having gained superknowledge.<br />The book includes several self contained short biographies, mainly by the Germans Helmuth Hecker and the late Ven Nanyaponika.  It is sadly short on details on the great female disciples.  Perhaps more room can be created later.<br />A must for anyone inspired by Buddhism and the potentiality of the human mind for lasting freedom.	2001-01-21

This slim book, gathers some very interesting information about him in a chatty style and represents and invaluable summary of how much we know about him from all sources and how much we don't.<br />We know about emperor Asoka largely due to his rock edicts in more than one language found across the extent of the ancient Mauryan empire c. 260BCE. These portray a ruler keen to establish his subjects in righteousness or Dhamma, incorporating such virtues as tollerance, respect for elders, caring for animals as well as people and establishing oneself in norms tending to good conduct and perfection. The emperor was obviously converted to Buddhism and by his assistance transformed this somewhat localised system of training into a world religion though not single handedly. There is no obvious parallel between him and Constantine, as Asoka unlike Constantine was not interested in a political creed.<br />Due to his patronage of Buddhism, southern and northern Buddhist schools, especially Sri Lankan chronicles for the former, recounted short biographies of him, describing his conversion, his works and his impact in their geographical provinces. These secondary sources often include a great deal of mythology.  Furthermore the southern and northern accounts do not easily match. There are also vague Indian references to king similar to Asoka but not Asoka, that the book covers with respect to laying red herrings to rest.<br />Indian scholars like to downplay that Asoka was a Buddhist. Sri Lankan scholars like to dispute this. The book represents debate and comparison on: the merits of the various sources on his life and work; the extent of Asoka's spiritual leanings and what the differing sources choose to emphasise about him as a man of religion, a king and a hero. Above all, it is concise and encyclopaedic in its assessment.<br />The book however does not take some of the arguments far enough to reveal how much we can say by the lack of evidence. For example, Asoka has been blamed for the collapse of the Mauryan empire, the fact is, we don't know anything about his father Bindusara nor much about what happened after him. This lack of evidence blows apart any notion or assumption that the empire dissolved due to him.<br />Emperor Asoka embraced the highest systems of ethics for a politician and did his best to implement them without it seems becoming a total pacifist. He has been a model ruler for succeeding Asian monarchs and should be an example to Western leaders who scarcely give the rights of animals the slightest thought. <br />This book should be of interest to anyone who wishes to delve into these areas. At the moment a minority scholarly area, this story deserves to be retold and represents an education.  Short and concise, this book represents a comprehensive summary with polemical comparison to satisfy a critical reader.	2001-01-21

His crime was being a free thinker in a short age of turmoil.  He was however fondly remembered and documented.  Hypatia was first brought to my attention by Carl Sagan in his television series Cosmos.  She has often been represented as a pillar of wisdom in an age of growing dogma.  Unlike with Socrates we know much less about her life and teachings.  She is remembered precisely as a martyr who was sacrificed rather than executed by a literalist Christian mob inspired by &quot;St&quot; Cyril, apparently as she was regarded as a threat to Christendom and theology by certain regio-political figures.  Enough material on her survived not least owing to the strong memories evoked at the manner of her despatch which turned her into a historical icon.<br />This excellent short well sourced book is a biographic scenography in the best sense of the word.  It does not sadly cover the destruction of the great library or go into great length about the history and politics of 4th century Alexandria but it blows the cobwebs and embelishments that are associated with this enigmatic figure leaving a strong, uncompromising educated presence who would have been of extreme high standing to have obtained the death she received at the hands of bigots.<br />The importance of Hypatia is that she represents a phase in history where Greek religion was being destroyed by the then politicised Roman state religion.  Hypatia represents a tragic victim of this dark phase when a great deal of knowledge was irrevocably lost (e.g.Gandy and Freke, the Jesus Mysteries etc.,).<br />To know the real Hypatia, and that phase of history, this is one of the best places to begin.	2001-01-20

Gould Wallace came second and Darwin came first.  For those of us who have studied Wallace, the above (though qualified) observation represents a misaprehension.  Darwin was the pioneer of the modern theory of evolution and Wallace was an equivalent pioneer of biogeography.<br />This book is a treat.  It is that rare amalgamation of  biography, the geologic history of the Malay archipelago and an account of the geology and biodiversity of the Malay archipelago with maximal interest to any biologist or anyone who has the slightest interest in the wildlife of Austro-Asia.<br />It goes into exquisite detail into the formation of endemic species on island communities and bemoans the lack of botanical exposure in most studies.  It also has one or two spectacular maps of ancient SE Asia.  More maps and diagrams would have aided the discussion about localities which are usually very obscure to most readers.<br />This book deserves to be talked about and will certainly benefit the wildlife and our appreciation of Wallace and that region in all facets.

His statements, especially in the first few chapters are gold dust for social reformers and social scientists, trying to tap into words to express their frustrations with what we can sometimes see as errors and an odious hollowness to many things conventionally regarded as Progress or Laudible.  Who indeed can name the 7 deadly sins or the 4 cardinal virtues?<br />Then there are those more practical ideas about the ethics of hard work, the fallacies in development planning and how many limitations set by money and raw materials are not limitations but excuses against small scale progressive schemes.  This is often the antidote to Adam Smith.<br />The ethics in planting trees if applied to India and many other places could undoubtedly solve the world's problems en masse it seems as reccommended for India, especially in reducing Green house gasses.<br />The question remains if communities and societies can grasp the nettle and act out some of Schumacher's more workable schemes, especially if the USA for example collapses into an economic oblivion.  Can we learn to live without mass capitalism and be happy?<br />The politics and philosphy of moderation and environmental economy is still in its infancy but thanks to Schumaker economists are trying to build in the environmental perspective.<br/>This book is therefore a persuasive milestone.	2000-11-03

History and its emperors are littered with tales of the horse and the equine symbollism in war and heroism is still with us.  Given such a magical subject McFadden's book represents a somewhat staid academic account in the style of a scientific paper.  Peppered with many references McFadden treats the reader like an academic used to such presentation and fails to enliven his topic.  He touches all too briefly on the cultural importance of the horse and the book lacks any decent illustrations save several charts and technical drawings.<br />McFadden has certainly put in a great deal of hard work and covers many topics from the history of the study of horse evolution to geneology, geological time and the work he and his co-workers have produced.  The book is too specific on the Equidae and does not deal adequately with recently extinct members of this family like the quagga and prehistoric species.  Nor does it explain clearly why horses may have dissapeared from the Americas.  Parts of the book, e.g., the limb locking mechanism were for me hard to follow.  The book is afraid of speculation.<br />It provides ample materials and references to the student and to the paleontologist and is a good textbook.  It fails to dramatise its subject and to attract a &quot;lay audience&quot;.  We are not really treated to what makes horses so special but to its credit it represents a highly authoritative and up to (its) date digest.	2000-10-10

A literary autobiography set in Kenya during an uncertain and enterprising colonial era before the First World War.<br />It's strongest elements include a deep sensitivity to the travails of animal life up against white hunters and farmers, very full accounts of the Kikuyu people and their rivalries with other Africans and it also paints a vivid portrait of pioneering planters and their servants in the shadow of the Great War.  <br />The vantage of the book is greater than that of Out of Africa by Blixen being a less personal tale.  it is a faithful, sometimes harrowing tale culled from an excellent store of memories representing times and scenes gone by.  Huxley is not short on romance and tragedy.<br />This book is an ideal companion to those interested in the British Empire and African anthropology.  For naturalists it provides breathtaking accounts of white hunters and their quarry as a retrospective commentary on man's abuse of Africa's wild heritage.  Huxley writes quietly, sensitively and impartially providing philosophic insights in a heuristic and magical narrative.  Always compelling, this is an important primary text.	2000-10-10

He gives special treatment to topics like Enviromentalism, Feminist issues, Economics and Homosexuality in a Buddhist context and gives an overview of many accounts expressed on these topics.

But I don't believe most of  it anymore after questioning experts and doing some research.<br />A lot of  the evidence for the book (that Jesus did not die etc.)comes from the  Shroud of Turin and the author points to his (other)book about it, but we  now know that the shroud was a clever forgery using pigments.  No traces of  blood or sweat have been chemically detected though pigments have and there  is the carbon dating evidence.  This matter is at any rate sealed by very  good modern books explaining it all.  Kirsten mentions that Jesus' language  Aramaic was used in NW India.  There is nothing mysterious about this,  Aramaic was a widespread language and Emperor Asoka did some of his rock  Edicts in this language so the fact that the Jews are supposed to have  settled in NW India is again tenuous.  As for similarities of place names  with Biblical names, it's like comparing chalk with cheese just because  they may look the same.  There is no evidence that Jesus went to India or  that he was a Buddhist which is what the author's arguments boil down to.   It may well be that Eastern thought reached Alexandria by the 1st C. AD but  we can scarcely reconstruct anything specific about the events following  Jesus' death.  The one event Christian scholars point to as certain is that  Jesus died on the cross and it was the death that was the focal point for  Christianity.<br />Gnostic Christians persecuted as heretics may well have  fled to India later which explains the St. Thomas debacle.<br />The book does  make you think, but it is not an article of faith.	2000-08-17

Either they are written by people who have had no contact with Buddhism, culturally or by practice (or at best very little  practice of the wrong sort) thus taking a literalist approach to translated  Buddhist scripts or they are too specialist, providing a view of Buddhism  based on only one school or a narrow emphasis, often hawking for  influence.<br />Professor Harvey has both contacted Buddhism culturally and  continues to make an honest attempt to put Buddhism into practice.  An  introduction to Buddhism is one of the best overall introductions to this  vast subject now available, superseding equivalent good books which are by  now up to 50 years too old.  Harvey combines scholarship including a  knowledge of Pali and Sanskrit along with sensitivity to the contexts in  which the various scriptures can be seen.<br />In the forest of competing  books out now, this one can be recommended without reservation.	2000-07-31

Cousins, Buddhism in a nutshell	This book gives very good articles on all the world's main religions and they are usually written by practitioner's of these religions who also tend to be scholars.  Encyclopaedic, imbued with rigour, candour and a dash of  faith which is essential in avoiding an all too objective and critical  approach.<br />The article on Buddhism in this book is one of the best if not  the best I've encountered.  It does not repeat the date of the Buddha as  earlier than the 5th century BC (making Buddhism 2400 years old rather than  the oft quoted 2500 years old), and does not begin to talk about Buddhism  by describing the 4 noble truths, like lesser books would.<br />This article  should be read, by those who want to have the low down on Buddhism  including beginners and those with a deeper interest, and it captures the  essence of Buddhism in a hard to beat nutshell.<br />The author, Mr Lance  Cousins was due to write a whole book on Buddhism for Penguin, but this  project was scrapped as he was too busy, and had to do an Abhidhamma  translation.  This is probably the next best thing.  His students, Peter  Harvey and Rupert Gethin have turned out introductory books on Buddhism  which are pretty good, and these testify to the depth of Mr Cousins  knowledge on the subject.	1999-11-21
