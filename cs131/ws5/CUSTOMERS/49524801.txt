Since the root of all conflict is seeing differences between yourself and another, love truly seems to be the key to eliminating conflict.\\" - Doreen Virtue<br /><br />Collectively, our bodies are groaning under the weight of environmental pollution, sulfites, conflict, psychic debris, and ego-induced fears and stressors. On a larger scale, this strain is taking a toll on Mother Earth and precious natural resources.<br /><br />In her book Goddesses & Angels - Awakening Your Inner High-Priestess and \\"Source-eress\\", angel therapist and clairvoyant channel Doreen Virtue sounds a clarion call for reclaiming the Divine feminine that has largely been banished from modern culture. Stressing the importance of balance between feminine and masculine energies (rather than demonizing the latter), Doreen relates raw personal anecdotes and spiritual lessons for welcoming and integrating the Goddess.<br /><br />As she did in previous books like Angel Medicine, Doreen shares mystical, alchemical, and esoteric teachings culled from various shamans, healers, historians, scientists, and \\"new\\" kids that she encounters in her world travels. For example, Doreen and her husband (author/shaman Steven Farmer) meet with a Mayan astrologer in Cancun. The astrologer relates how the 13 houses of the Mayan system connect to the 13 annual cycles of the moon and feminine energy. As depicted on the Mexican flag, the matriarchal Mayan tradition believed in the balance of the serpent and the eagle-the feminine and masculine-for inner and outer harmony. In fact, the pyramid of Chichen Itza-based on the two Mayan calendars-reflects the fusing of these energies with the interior steps adding up to 260 (the number of days in the feminine Tzolkin calendar) and the outer steps adding up to 365 (the number of days in the masculine Haab calendar.)<br /><br />Woven throughout the fascinating conversations and synchronicities Doreen shares in Goddesses & Angels are intriguing metaphysical teachings based upon the Guidance and channelings of both Angels and Goddesses.  Archangel Michael tells Doreen, quite bluntly, that sulfur-containing chemicals known as sulfites were causing her body to bloat and her skin to itch. As soon as she eliminated sulfites from her diet, the symptoms disappeared and 45 pounds melted right off her.<br /><br />Other fascinating information found in Goddesses and Angels include:<br /><br />* Healing ceremonies experienced in a sweat lodge, upon crystal beds, atop the rocks of Arizona, on the shores of sandy beaches, at the Lourdes grotto, within a Goddess Temple, at Brigit's Well, in Bernadette's Cahot and other sacred sites<br /><br />* The return of mer-people to the Earth and the possible aquatic origins of mankind-as well as the connection to dolphins<br /><br />* The unedited Course in Miracles, known as the Urtext, and how this document differs from the popular edited Course<br /><br />* Attributes, gifts, and personality traits of the four elements-Fire, Water, Air, and Earth-and how these correlate to hair and eye color<br /><br />* Messages from the Dalai Lama, Amma (the hugging saint), and Masaru Emoto as they relate to consciousness, peace, and compassion<br /><br />* Remembering Atlantean and Lemurian culture and spiritual teachings-including how the cravings for chocolate are the cravings for Atlantis<br /><br />* Further observations about the Indigo, Crystal, and Rainbow children<br /><br />* Manifestation and abundance<br /><br />* Biological functions such as the synchronization of mirror neurons and how they connect to increased consciousness<br /><br />* The power of water and fire energy and how they connect to invoking and manifesting Goddess energy<br /><br />* Energy drainage and its connection to etheric cords, excessive giving without regards to self-nurturing, and negative people and attitudes<br /><br />* Interactions with-and messages from-Goddesses such as Artemis, Xochiquetzal, Brigit, Kali, and Mother Mary as well as archangels Michael, Metatron, Raziel, and others<br /><br />* The power-and purpose-of prayer<br /><br />Other interesting tidbits and wise counsel are packed into Goddesses & Angels-Awakening Your Inner High-Priestess and \\"Source-eress\\". Part II of the book-spanning only 14 pages-lists various Goddesses and Angels, but the information is very basic. If you want a more thorough treatment of Goddesses and Angels-without the travelogue-Archangels and Ascended Masters is a better choice.<br /><br />I had resistance to some of the theories raised in the book, but I tried to keep an open mind. For example, Doreen believes in Walk-Ins, which are supposedly souls that \\"stepped into\\" the body of another when an individual is suicidal or traumatized. In his book Journey of Souls, hypnotherapist Dr. Michael Newton emphatically denies the existence of Walk-Ins because the transference would supplant and individual's personally chosen path. After regressing hundreds of people over the years, it was obvious that Walk-Ins did not exist.<br /><br />In addition, Doreen elevates dolphins to a spiritually ascended state, as do many New Agers. Yet, neither she nor dolphin devotees acknowledge the complex social structure of dolphins and how orchestrated gang rape, bullying, the harassment and forced isolation of females, and the killing of dolphin babies so they can \\"get it on\\" with the  mother-occur quite frequently. (If this bursts your metaphysical bubble, you're not alone. My husband and I were disappointed to discover this, as well.) These behaviors are extra chilling in light of Doreen's belief that dolphins, once \\"one with the humans\\", shape-shifted and went to the sea until humanity became more \\"peaceful and environmentally conscious\\"-and that dolphin channelings assert that \\"Now is the time...we're coming back to take over the world.\\"<br /><br />Fans of Doreen Virtue and books like The Lightworker's Way and Angel Medicine will be thrilled with Goddesses & Angels. If you're new to Doreen's work, it's not necessary to have read any of her other books to get something out of this one. However, if you're not used to New Age ideas, you may find this book a bit \\"out there\\". Doreen shows us her vulnerability, fears, and personal challenges and how she navigates her own path with the help of the Goddesses and Angels. It's refreshing to see such openness and curiosity by an author, especially in an era where many spiritual teachers arrogantly declare their personal beliefs as rock-solid universal truths and deride others with differing experiences.<br /><br />Humanity and the planet are in desperate need of feminine energy to balance the unchecked masculine energy that has reigned for centuries, and this book is an important addition to the swelling chorus welcoming the return of the Goddess.t, Kali, and Mother Mary as well as archangels Michael, Metatron, Raziel, and others <br />* The power-and purpose-of prayer <br /> <br />Other interesting tidbits and wise counsel are packed into Goddesses & Angels-Awakening Your Inner High-Priestess and \\"Source-eress\\".

Creative dreams are all around us in our `real lives'. Being actively creative feels good and is a service to the world. The more creative dreamers we have in action, the better the world will be.\\" - Susan Ariel Rainbow Kennedy (SARK)<br /><br />SARK is the paragon of child-like enthusiasm. Her books and decks encourage self-expression, creativity, playfulness, and light-heartedness. She also advocates eating mangoes naked, napping, and succulent living.<br /><br />In SARK's Creative Dream Game, the author challenges individuals to identify and release their dreams. By exploring the nature of a creative dream and identifying blockages to its realization-either by playing the Game by yourself or with others-a window of discovery opens for insight, understanding, and manifestation.<br /><br />The Creative Dream Game is a 50-card deck and guide addressing the following ten categories, which individuals can explore alone or with others:<br /><br />* Games<br /><br />* Gifts<br /><br />* Love<br /><br />* Positive Challenges<br /><br />* Time<br /><br />* Permission<br /><br />* Fear<br /><br />* Reminders<br /><br />* Resources<br /><br />* Celebrating<br /><br />The cards can be used in a variety of ways. For example, you can do the Quick Start method, choosing three cards at random to see what they \\"speak\\" to you. Or you can begin a game by stating your creative dream, choosing the categories, and laying out the cards. SARK gives you simple instructions for how to play. You can then choose variations of the Game. For example:<br /><br />* One for One - Each player chooses a card. Tell or write how the card applies to you<br /><br />* One for All - Each player chooses a card, tells how the card applies to you, and how you perceive it applies to each other player in the group.<br /><br />* All for One - Each player chooses a card and then takes turns telling how each player's card applies to him or her.<br /><br />* All In - One player chooses a card and takes turns telling how that one card applies to each player in the group.<br /><br />An example of one of the Fear cards is Blaming. SARK writes:<br /><br />\\"We can all find people or things to blame about why we're not spending more time with our creative dreams. Blaming the self is especially popular. Blame is misdirected energy and a habitual fear reaction. This energy can be refocused. (Action) Blame everyone and everything! Speak and write about it, make a list. Then, recycle or burn the list-it will separate these thoughts from you. If you spoke your list, visualize it burning up.\\"<br /><br />An example of one of the Love cards is Radical Self-Acceptance. SARK writes:<br /><br />\\"This means accepting yourself as you actually are, not as an idealized version of yourself. This self-acceptance leads to expansive change. As we become aware and accept ourselves we can allow changes. (Action) Identify 1-3 areas in which you lack self-acceptance. Now describe 3 areas you feel self-accepting. Write or speak these.\\"<br /><br />SARK's Creative Dream Game is an interesting way to activate, accelerate, and navigate you creative dream life. Through self-inquiry and playful exploration, individuals and groups alike can tap into new ways of thinking, being, and doing. However, SARK's child-like, block-letter scrawl adorns every card as it does in all her books and decks. Unfortunately, many of these cards border on illegible. I had to squint, trying to make out some of the words! Considering there's quite a bit of information on each card, the small print makes it even more difficult to read, especially compared to a deck like her Juicy Living Cards.<br /><br />I realize that her child-like writing is a part of her shtick, but in this case, the scrawl serves as a hindrance to getting the most out of her Game. Pity, because the author has a lot of great exercises and wisdom to impart. If you can look past the presentation and are a fan of SARK, you'll likely appreciate the Creative Dream Game-especially if you're committed to releasing your dreams and letting them fly.<br /><br />(To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])them fly.

With every card in an upright position, ingredients can be assembled in the order they will be used and instructions can be clearly understood.\\" - Corrine Kenner<br /><br />The Epicurean Tarot Recipe Cards is an unusual offering by Corrine Kenner, author of Tall Dark Stranger and Tarot Journaling (1/06). These cards-designed to nourish your body, mind and spirit-come in a sturdy, attractive box that stands vertically on a base.<br /><br />Measuring approximately 6 ½ X 4 ½ inches, each glossy card features a Universal Waite Tarot card (approximately 2 ½ x 3 ½ inches), corresponding recipe, and amusing notation about the card as it relates to the recipe.<br /><br />The 35-paged booklet that accompanies the Epicurean Tarot Recipe Cards offers several ways to use the \\"deck\\", including:<br /><br />* Active meditation<br /><br />* Learning the Tarot<br /><br />* Preparing a magical meal<br /><br />* Hosting a Tarot pot luck dinner<br /><br />* Assessing lifestyle and spiritual nourishment<br /><br />* Brainstorming for creating additional recipes<br /><br />The companion booklet also provides traditional meanings for each of the 78 cards.<br /><br />For the Major Arcana, Ms. Kenner has selected recipes inspired by the card imagery-almost as if the characters had chosen favorite recipes to share with the world. The Minor Arcana recipes reflect the essence of the four suits: Wands recipes (Fire) are spicy and hot, Cups recipes (Water) call for seafood or fresh fruit, Pentacles (Earth) recipes feature homegrown vegetables and hearty meats, while Swords (Air) recipes call for chopping, cutting, slicing, dicing, and spearing.<br /><br />Some of the tempting recipes featured in the Epicurean Tarot include:<br /><br />* The Fool's Caramelized Nuts<br /><br />* 9 of Cups Beer-Cheese Soup<br /><br />* 4 of Cups Crab Cakes<br /><br />* Queen of Pentacles' Welsh Rabbit<br /><br />* The Charioteer's Jerky<br /><br />* The Tower's Banana Flamb&eacute;<br /><br />* The Moon's Lobster Bisque<br /><br />* 7 of Swords Midnight Snack Dip<br /><br />* King of Wands' Jabanero Salsa<br /><br />* 10 of Pentacles Chicken and Dumplings<br /><br />* Ace of Swordfish Baked in Parchment<br /><br />Most of the recipes serve four-six people (depending on portion size), with readily available ingredients.<br /><br />Epicurean Tarot Recipe Cards would likely appeal to gourmands and Tarot enthusiasts alike. Many of the recipes don't appeal to me, but there's no accounting for taste. It's evident that Ms. Kenner has put a lot of effort and thought to the gustatory correlations of Tarot imagery, meaning, and elements.<br /><br />What would have made this offering even better is if it would have featured original, whimsical Tarot cards (think Housewives Tarot) rather than the Universal Tarot. For example, the cover of the box shows the Magician wielding a wooden spoon and a wire whisk; carrying this type of motif throughout the cards would have made for quite a unique experience! Still, the Epicurean Tarot reflects originality and enthusiasm-and there's nothing on the market (that I know of) that's like it.<br /><br />(Note: I found two mistakes in the companion booklet. The 2 of Swords was referred to as the 2 of Cups and the King of Cups was referred to as the King of Wands.)<br /><br />(To see 2 card images from the Epicurean Tarot, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])and Dumplings    * Ace of Swordfish Baked in Parchment    Most of the recipes serve four-six people (depending on portion size), with readily available ingredients.

US	49524801	RSM0CHL85I59	1572814888	965555529	The Archeon Tarot	Books	5	63	67	N	N	More Than Meets The Eye	\\"Had I lived in the late 19th Century, I'd like to believe I would have been a Symbolist. I'll never actually know, but I think I would have felt at home among those artists and innovators.\\" - Timothy Lantz<br /><br />In my experience, I have found that I have one of three reactions when I get a new deck:<br /><br />1. I instantly love it<br />2. I instantly dislike it<br />3. I'm unsure how I feel about it, but I'm leaning towards #2<br /><br />However, I always give decks a chance-putting them through their paces, seeing how they read, allowing for the possibility that they may grow on me despite my misgivings.<br /><br />When I first saw online images from The Archeon Tarot by Timothy Lantz, I thought they were gothicly superb. When I got the deck in my hands, however, I had the #3 reaction. Would these ambiguous images \\"speak\\" to me? Was there anything to glean, intuitively, from these dark, Rorschachian depictions?<br /><br />After working with the Archeon Tarot, I quickly realized that this wasn't a deck to be read with the left-brain. That is, I needed to dispense with the \\"OK, we got Wands here. That's masculine, indicates movement...\\" I'm not saying an individual *couldn't* read these cards by rote memory and logic. I'm just saying that I realized that *I* wouldn't be able to.<br /><br />So I did something unusual. I corralled my husband who is NOT a Tarot reader (but is highly intuitive), to experiment with me. (Oh the joys of being a Scorpionic couple!) I don't do many readings for myself, often going weeks or months without pulling any personal cards. If I do consult the Tarot, it's always for \\"bigger\\" situations-the existential aspects of life.<br /><br />I shuffled the deck and then invited my husband to ask a question, select the cards, and interpret them. His interpretation of the cards was unexpected and highly accurate. For example, The Devil-normally a card of warning or one indicating obsession-was interpreted quite differently by my husband. He saw the \\"wings\\" of The Devil as a \\"schematic\\"-a blueprint beckoning for realization and manifestation based upon his actions so that he could \\"fly\\". It was also card indicating that he would continue to transcend former religious taboos by his choice of reading material and personal worldview.<br /><br />When it was my turn, I had some misgivings. I wanted to ask a question about my 7-year-old son, but I actually thought, \\"Do I want to waste such an important question on a deck I'm unsure about?\\" I decided to go ahead with it.<br /><br />I interpreted the cards mentally and invited my husband to interpret them. His interpretation not only expanded upon what I picked up intuitively, but also delivered accurate, comforting wisdom. Amazingly, my son confirmed the reading within a few hours--based on something he said!<br /><br />I was so impressed with the readings-and confident of the accuracy of the Archeon Tarot-that I asked about a health question that's been troubling me.<br /><br />Now let me back up and say that Mr. Lantz has taking some liberties with the elemental aspects of the Minor Arcana. In traditional Tarot, Pentacles and Cups are feminine, while Wands and Swords are masculine. In the Archeon Tarot, Pentacles are masculine and Wands are feminine. Apparently \\"tradition\\" was more ingrained than I had suspected, because initially my thoughts screamed \\"What?! How can you deem Wands *feminine*?!\\"<br /><br />Interestingly, my health question referred to a \\"female\\" issue and lo and behold, I drew all Wands. The color saturating these cards and the images-they all told a story...a feminine story and that was clear, appropriate, and scarily accurate.<br /><br />Other than the masculine/feminine switch with the Minor suits, The Archeon Tarot employs traditional renderings. The Pages--often the \\"messengers\\" of the Tarot--appropriately becomes The Heralds. In addition, the intriguing card backings are fully reversible.<br /><br />The Archeon Tarot comes with a 47-paged L(ittle) W(hite) B(ook), but Mr. Lantz often applies fresh interpretations to the cards (both upright and reversed). For example, the Ace of Swords shows a crystalline skull impaled with a sword. One of the keywords for this card is \\"clairvoyance\\", a concept I hadn't associated with this Ace previously. Yet, this idea made perfect sense to me!<br /><br />In my estimation, The Archeon Tarot is a very intuitive deck. If you \\"read\\" best with detailed depictions, bright/cheery images, logic or regurgitated meanings, you may find this deck troublesome. However, if you're able to relax, reading from the heart and the right brain, you'll likely glean a whole host of richly layered, relevant information.

She was a happy homemaker who seemed to have it all-a devoted husband and obedient children, a sparkling home that was the talk of the town, a fashion sense to die for, and far more than her fair share of women's intuition.\\" - From the instruction book<br /><br />The Housewives Tarot is a hilarious domestic divination kit that comes in an attractive \\"recipe\\" box. The recipe dividers separate the Major Arcana, Minor Arcana, and the instruction book. If that's not amusing enough, there are actual recipes on the back of these dividers, including Divinated Eggs and Ice Box Fortune Cake.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of 50's d&eacute;cor and I assumed this deck was a mere novelty.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong!<br /><br />While some of the montages are laugh-out-loud hilarious in presentation, there is a kernel of truth in each depiction. For example, The Magician sports slicked-back hair (I can practically *smell* the Bryl-cream!), toothy grin, and smarmy wide-eyes-while his hand gesture proclaims \\"tada!\\"...referring to a sparkling new (or is it?) washing machine.<br /><br />A huckster salesman. Now if that isn't a darn good rendering of The Magician...! And how many of you considered that The Magician could embody the sycophant archetype? It never occurred to me until I got my hands on this deck!<br /><br />The Housewives Tarot provided several other \\"epiphanies\\", which surprised and delighted me-in large part to the brief, clever interpretations for domestic metaphors. In addition, the 96-paged instruction booklet provides 3 keywords for each card, a brief interpretation (upright only), and five spreads (including \\"The Dinette\\").<br /><br />Some of my favorite cards in this deck are:<br /><br />Death - Depicted by rancid mayonnaise crawling with flies, an \\"expired\\" timer, and rotten half of tomato. The label? \\"Real Salmonella. Everything Expires\\" (complete with skull, cross bones, and roses!).<br /><br />Justice - A perfectly coiffed mother-looking like a young Elizabeth Taylor-has her son turned over her knee, ready to spank him with a wooden spoon. She wears a mischievous grin, the boy looks like his mouthing the words \\"help!\\", and his lollipop goes flying out if his hand. An interesting take on \\"what goes around comes around\\"!<br /><br />The Hermit - A woman soaks luxuriously in a large tub, several bars of soap surrounding her. Need I say more?<br /><br />The Devil - A long-legged chocolate cake holds a cigarette in one hand and martini in the other. She's surrounded by a can of \\"Spork\\", instant coffee, a pack of cigarettes, Redi-Cheez, TV dinner, and a bottle of Valium.<br /><br />Knight of Pentacles - A smiling, tuxedoed young man holding on to the handle of a shiny red lawnmower.<br /><br />My husband, who's not a Tarot reader (yet!), thinks The Housewives Tarot is utterly hysterical. His personal favorite is the 2 of Swords: a blindfolded woman about to carve a turkey. Interestingly, we both put this deck through its paces-doing readings for each other. He was able to \\"read\\" these cards easily and gave me some accurate, interesting insight. Likewise, I was able to do the same for his particular question.<br /><br />The cards of the Major Arcana are trimmed in a black/red motif, while the borders of the Minors are depicted thusly:<br /><br />Pentacles - Pea green<br />Swords - Red<br />Wands - Tan<br />Cups - Aquamarine<br /><br />The backs are fully reversible, featuring a red and cream tartan design and have a matte finish.<br /><br />While some of the interpretations in the instruction book-often peppered with name-brand items like Calgon, General Foods International Coffee and TV Guide-may seem cheesy on first glance, the meanings given are surprisingly ingenious.<br /><br />While I loved this deck as soon as I opened it, I had no idea that I'd actually be able to *read* with it! And to show that you don'thave to be Tarot-adept to read with The Housewives Tarot, my husband can read with it, too!<br /><br />Fans of the June Cleaver era will absolutely love The Housewives Tarot. However, as I said, you don't need to have an interest in this era to enjoy this deck and use it skillfully. Those looking for a fun, non-threatening deck to use with clients will find a jewel here-without sacrificing accuracy or incisiveness.<br /><br />(Note: I discovered that there were two 10 of Wands card in my deck, and that I was missing the 8 of Wands card.

We need to be receptive to the messages that come through thoughts, words, visions, and feelings.\\" - From the DVD<br /><br />Since 1996, angel therapist Dr. Doreen Virtue has taught thousands of people how to connect, communicate, and heal with the angels. In the How to Give an Angel Card Reading Kit, Dr. Virtue gives instructions on consecrating and \\"clearing\\" a new deck, knowing when to stop shuffling, and laying out and interpreting a 3-card spread.<br /><br />The kit comes in a sturdy, attractive box featuring a lid trimmed in shimmering gold fabric. The box measures approximately 5 ¾ X 5 ¾ inches and contains the Archangel Oracle Cards deck and Guidebook, as well as a DVD.<br /><br />Oracle cards, says Dr. Virtue, are a \\"no-brainer\\" way to talk to heaven and that you can't make a mistake when using them. When giving a reading, \\"we are a telephone for heaven. We don't edit or censor the message, we just deliver it.\\"<br /><br />According to Dr. Virtue, angels answer the prayer of the heart, which is why cards may not seem relevant to the question asked. Individuals often ask they question they *think* they should ask, rather than what's really of concern to them.

My husband and I saw this book in a large bookstore chain last week and were totally intrigued. It was displayed near the checkout counter and the colorful cover photo of the fierce, unusual mandrill caught our eye.<br /><br />When I picked up the book, it was HEAVY. Very heavy. It weighs more than my cats! (We're talking about eleven pounds here.)<br /><br />We flipped through the pages, utterly fascinated by the arresting color photos and intriguing information offered for hundreds of animals. Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians, Fish, Invertabrates--they're all here.<br /><br />Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife introduces readers to the principles of classification and even provides a colorful chart for the classification levels. The book describes Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species and how they apply to all the animals. (Remember 8th grade biology and having to learn all this?!). Throughout the book, mini-charts are extrapolated for each creature so you know their classification at a glance.<br /><br />For example, tiger classification would be:<br /><br />Kingdom: Animalia<br /><br />Phylum: Chordata<br /><br />Order: Carnivora<br /><br />Family: Felidae<br /><br />Genus: Panthera<br /><br />Species: Panthera tigris<br /><br />In addition to the classification system, the Introduction discusses Habitats such as grasslands, desert, tropical forest, mountains, polar regions, coral reefs, and more.<br /><br />The colorful photographs are stunning, showing a wide variety of species. For example, you won't find one type of monkey. You'll find many--*with* color pictures and stats.<br /><br />Designed in an easy-to-read encyclopedic format, extensive data--including unusual facts--are provided for the creatures, including:<br /><br />*Location (With mini-map)<br /><br />*Habitat symbols<br /><br />*Weight<br /><br />*Social Unit (Mammals only)<br /><br />*Migration<br /><br />*Plumage (Birds only)<br /><br />*Breeding<br /><br />*Classification key<br /><br />*Status (Common, Vulnerable, Endangered, etc.)<br /><br />and much more.<br /><br />The sheer amount of color photos on these glossy pages--sometimes filling up a page and half's worth of space--were amazing enough. But that this book is presented in an easy-to-understand, engaging style is--perhaps--even *more* amazing!<br /><br />My husband and I \\"oohed\\" and \\"ahhhed\\" in the bookstore as we investigated various animals and discovered amazing facts. For example, did you know that giraffes move from a walk directly to a gallop because their long legs and short body make trotting impossible without tripping? That they can reach speeds exceeding 31 mph? That they must splay their legs--and even bend at the knee--when they drink water? Why? Well, their heart pumps blood at an enormous pressure in order to reach their brain when upright. When their head lowers to drink, a series of one-way valves regulate the blood's force and flow to prevent damage to the brain.<br /><br />Fascinating, no?<br /><br />We keep this book in the living room so we can pick it up any time just to look at the pictures or learn something my new. Even my son picks it up to browse through, often asking us questions. For example, lemurs feature prominently in the movie Madagascar--as well as the PBS show Zoobamoofoo. My son then asked me to look up lemurs--and was delighted to see all the different kinds!<br /><br />At 624 pages, Animal - The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife is a great book for those who are curious about animals. It's also a great reference for homeschoolers, especially in terms of biology and earth science. Lastly, if your spiritual path includes shamanism and power animals, this book is a GREAT resource for learning the behaviors and attributes of various creatures--which will help you learn more about the spiritual ramifications of your spirit animal/s.<br /><br />(P.S. Amazon's price is about $9 cheaper than what we paid at the bookstore. What a great deal for such a hefty, informative book!)eat deal for such a hefty, informative book!)	2005-10-02
US	49524801	R230ZOFCHDJ86H	0738708208	47725695	The Mind Box	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Solid Debut Novel	In a town where rumors spread faster than wildfires, Hollywood is abuzz with speculation about Eddie Ealing's mysterious email from \\"Mike's Gifts\\", a shadowy business that specializes in the most calculated kind of revenge. With no clear motive and a very long list of suspects, Hollywood homicide detective Lane Daily is called back from vacation to lead the investigation. Never one to do things by the book, she has a hard-earned reputation for cracking some of the L.A.P.D.'s toughest cases.<br /><br />Daily's investigation soon uncovers a trail of lies, betrayals, and vicious mind games that prove someone is going to great lengths to hide the facts about a promising new wonder drug. When she becomes a target herself, Daily learns that behind the lies is a secret so powerful it can destroy the mind of anyone who gets too close to the truth.<br /><br />Mind Box is a solid debut mystery by A.J. Diehl. The cliched tough-girl cop (who picks losers for men) got just a tad old, but the characterization was convincing. I was interested in the female psychologist/journalist, too, and would have loved to have gotten a better feel for her character.<br /><br />I received an uncorrected proof months ago, and I assume the inconsistencies have been corrected (let's hope!). For example, a man supposedly impregnates a girl in 1972 and strangles her when she threatens to tell his wealthy wife of 40 years. Do the math: this guy would have had to been at least 60 or so years of age in 1972 (assuming he married at age 20). He attends a party in present day (let's assume 2005) which would make him about 93 years old. Yet, he's not characterized in this story as an old man!<br /><br />The story itself is why I gave this book 4 stars. I'd really like to see more from this author. However, the characters seemed a bit tired/cliched, especially as one that has read quite a few detective novels. If this author continues with solid storytelling--and perhaps imbues more nuance, descriptive details, and original \\"voices\\" for her characters--she'll be a force to be reckon with in the police procedural genre.

We suggest that anytime you feel that you need inspiration, you just curl up in your favorite chair...and pull out one of our cards.\\" - The feline authors<br /><br />Cat Comfort Cards is a 50-card deck that is absolutely saturated with color. I've reviewed dozens of decks and this one is by far the most colorful! Magenta, fuchsia, chartreuse, lemon yellow, electric orange, violet, cobalt-you get the picture.<br /><br />It's a straightforward deck, without any guidebook. What you get are 50 vibrant, whimsical cards that feature a feline-related saying one side and some advice on the other. Some examples include:<br /><br />Technocat - Learn a new skill. It will open up many possibilities.<br /><br />Bureaucat - Get that paperwork done. You'll feel better.<br /><br />Scaredy Cat - Face your fears. They will disappear when you confront them.<br /><br />Cat's Eye - Open that inner eye. You'll see what's really happening.<br /><br />Angel Cat - Know that you're loved and protected.<br /><br />Catharsis - Enjoy the freedom that comes with release.<br /><br />Catacomb - Look deep inside. Take time to meditate or journey within.<br /><br />As with most decks published by Hay House, Cat Comfort Cards are of sturdy stock with a glossy finish. Fanciful images, bright colors, and a playful font grace each card-both front and back.<br /><br />These cards are major eye candy. I enjoyed going through each one, soaking in the amazing colors. Some of the cards were downright funny. One of my favorites is Cata-holic, which depicts a passed out cat surrounded by milk cartons. The message is \\"Curb your excesses. Everything in moderation.\\"<br /><br />Cat lovers will go wild over this unique deck. But even if you're not overly thrilled with cats, the original artwork and vivid colors will likely pull you in.

I just love these puzzles.<br /><br />Terry Stickels Frame Games have been featured in various newspapers and now 159 are gathered in one place in this volume.<br /><br />Shaped like a toilet seat (with the back depicting swirling water, presumably after a flush!), this 96-page book is a great way to challenge the mind and pass the time. Its convenient size lends itself nicely for portability--especially in larger purses, briefcases, and diaper bags!<br /><br />\\"Frame Games\\" are pictorial word puzzles. For example, one puzzle features a series of horizontal lines. In bold, the letters NME are at the fore. The answer? \\"Behind enemy lines\\".<br /><br />Some puzzles are pretty easy, but others are real stumpers! There's a few I haven't gotten yet, in fact.<br /><br />Rather than read this book all the way through, I pick it up every once in awhile just to solve a few puzzles. For example, earlier this evening I was sitting on the porch with my husband and we were trying to figure out some of the frame games.<br /><br />The answers are on consecutive pages in case you're tempted to peek. I actually wish they were all in the back because it's possible to accidentally see the answers to previous puzzles you may not have solved yet if your eye roams towards the center of the book!<br /><br />Sit & Solve Frame Games is great fun and would make an exceptional gift or stocking-stuffer for hard-to-buy-for folks who tend to enjoy puzzles.<br /><br />And hey! you just can't beat the affordability for this much amusement, either.	2005-09-28

For example, in the book Dora Goes to School, they needed to go to Letter Town and through Number Mountain in order to get Maestra Beatriz to school on time.<br /><br />However, Dance to the Rescue is a refreshing change from this formula. In fact, Map isn't even in the book.<br /><br />In the story, a wily dancing Elf is trapped in a magic bottle. Swiper feels sorry for him and releases him. However, a part of the bottle's magic is that it pulls Swiper inside to take his place.<br /><br />Dora and Boots have to figure out how to get Swiper out of the bottle--without getting sucked inside to replace him! The magic bottle tells them they must go to the Castle to win the King's dance contest in order to win one big wish. This wish can be used to free Swiper.<br /><br />Dora and Boots encounter marching ants, wiggling spiders and sneaky snakes on the journey--including some old friends who happen to sail the Ocean!<br /><br />What's neat about this book is that there are instructions at each challenge which encourage the child to get up and move. For example, Dora and Boots can't get past the marching ants until they march, march, march!<br /><br />Dora's Dance to the Rescue is quite colorful and longer than the usual Dora books. The new storytelling twists--including introducing several new characters and creatures--is a refreshing departure from the usual simplistic formula.<br /><br />My son really enjoys this book, too.<br /><br />I hope to see more Dora books like this one!	2005-09-28

The Halloween Cat is my favorite Dora the Explorer book--and we own about 10 of them!<br /><br />Featuring vibrant autumn images such as bright fallen leaves, The Halloween Cat tells the whimsical story of a lost black cat and the adventure to return him safely home.<br /><br />With the help of Boots, Map and Backpack, Dora must traverse the Haunted House and Spooky Forest in order to get to the Candy Castle--home of the Good Witch and the black cat.<br /><br />There are no scary elements in this book, but rather colorful, fanciful Halloween stand-bys like cobwebs, smiling jack-o'-lanterns, bats, and spiders--as well as friendly ghosts, waving trees, and costumed allligators.<br /><br />The Candy Castle is beautifully illustrated, as is the Good Witch, her shimmering broom, and the adorable black cat (who sports orange eyebrows!)<br /><br />As a parent, this is a very fun book to read to my son--not to mention being great eye candy! My son seems to love it as well, requesting it to be read to him every night this past week.<br /><br />The Halloween Cat is a Level 1 Ready-to-Read book. This means the book features simple stories, increased vocabulary, and longer sentences--especially compared to Pre-Level 1 books. As with other Level 1 Ready-to-Read Dora books, The Halloween Cat also features rebuses in place of some of the words--although the actual words *are* present...just in smaller script below the picture.<br /><br />A whimsical, colorful, gentle way to celebrate Halloween and friendship--and to teach your youngster to read.<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2005-09-28

Sometimes, Clifford misses his Dad. Last year on my father's birthday, Clifford did something surprising. He ran off in the middle of the party!\\" --From the book<br /><br />Clifford's Day With Dad is a story about Clifford visiting his father who lives far away in the country. Even though Clifford is much, much larger than his Dad, his father still thinks of him as the little puppy he loved so much.<br /><br />This book shows the many things that Clifford's Dad taught him in his formative years, including how to fetch, dig a hole, rummage through the trash to find interesting stuff, and chase motorcycles.<br /><br />Because Clifford is so huge, when he attempts these acts, the results are pretty disruptive...but amusing. For example, while his Dad digs a small hole, Clifford ends up digging a large hole that tunnels under the road! While his Dad rummages through the trash, Clifford gets the idea that it's easier to just dump the contents of the cans on the lawn. Of course, the neighbors aren't happy, so Clifford sheepishly cleans up his messes and restores things to their original state.<br /><br />Clifford's Day With Dad will likely be a big hit with fans of Clifford. It's an entertaining book for Father's Day--or any day. The sentences are simple which makes this a good book for budding readers, as well.	2005-09-28

The images of the animals are the expressions of nature help us to transcend our normal, waking consciousness so that we can more easily attune to ethereal realms and beings.\\" - From the book<br /><br />Throughout history, animals have appeared on cave drawings, pottery, sculpture, and paintings. Every culture contains myths, stories, songs and fairy tales featuring animals. For earth-based spiritual traditions, animals serve as protectors, messengers, and guides. Because animal archetypes are so strong within the human psyche, many individuals resonate with the mannerisms, defense strategies, social structures and habits of particular animals, insects, birds, and fish.<br /><br />In the book Animal Speak, author Ted Andrews provides comprehensive information on animal totems, including the process of discovering your own. He describes the function of animal totems, emphasizing that the unique characteristics of animal forms reveal much about our own innate powers and abilities. According to Andrews, the purpose of Animal Speak is five-fold:<br /><br />1. It will help you to determine your Nature totems<br />2. It will help you in learning to honor, attune, and invoke their energies more effectively in your life<br />3. It will assist you in discovering the hidden powers and significance of yourself, as is reflected by your totem<br />4. It will help you in applying the skills and adaptive powers of your totem to your own life environment<br />5. It will help you to learn the language of Nature (physical, spiritual, and magical) as it speaks to you every day, to read and apply what it says (through signs and omens), and in doing so help you to develolp a greater reverence and respect for all life, and greater power and control in your own.<br /><br />Andrews says that animal totems are also known by names such as spirit animals, power animals, totem helpers, and others. Regardless of what you call them, Andrews asserts that there are ten basics attributes of these totems including: the animal chooses the person, not the other way around, lifelong power animals are usually wild, not domesticated, and more than one person can share a totem animal.<br /><br />Animal Speak delves deep into more than 100 creatures and their habitats. Andrews discusses how to awaken to your spirit totems, the mystery of predator and prey, reading signs and omens in nature, and augury and the meaning of landscapes. He provides comprehensive totem dictionaries of bird totems, animal totems, insect totems, and reptile totems. For each creature, the author provides a Keynote phrase, as well as detailed observations on animal behavior, lore, and physical characteristics like plumage, fur, and coloring. He also notes idiosyncrasies, as well as seasonal, mating, and feeding habits.<br /><br />Here are but a few examples of Keynotes and Cycles of Power from the book:<br /><br />FOX<br /><br />Keynote: Feminine magic of camouflage, shapeshifting and invisibility<br />Cycle of Power: Nocturnal, Dawn, and Dusk<br /><br />EAGLES<br /><br />Keynote: Illumination of Spirit, Healing, and Creation<br />Cycle of Power: All Seasons and during Daylight<br /><br />ELEPHANT<br /><br />Keynote: Ancient Power, Strength, and Royalty<br />Cycle of Power: Year-round<br /><br />OTTER<br /><br />Keynote: Joy, Playfulness, and Sharing<br />Cycle of Power: Spring and Summer<br /><br />BUTTERFLY<br /><br />Keynote: Transmutation and the Dance of Joy<br /><br />CHAMELEON<br /><br />Keynote: Clairvoyance and Auric Sensitivity<br /><br />At 383 pages, Animal Speak provides a wealth of information for connecting with, and receiving Guidance from, animal spirits. Whether you seek to discover your animal totem, create and use magical animal rites, or call upon the protective powers of your power animal, Animal Speak provides you with the necessary tools for doing so.<br /><br />My favorite use for this book, however, is animal divination. If I notice that a particular bird, animal, or insect gets my attention-perhaps by cropping up on TV, in a book, or even in a dream--I then get out Andrews' book and see what messages the creatures may have for me. There's enough information in Animal Speak to extrapolate specific animal behavior to my life and see if there are connections-let alone taking into consideration Andrews' own divinatory insight. Whether it's a dragonfly, blue jay, groundhog, or butterfly I can turn to this book to find wise counsel from the animal kingdom.<br /><br />Because many the messages I receive are from the bird kingdom, I especially enjoy the Winged Enchantment section of Animal Speak, which covers bird totems, the initiation of Air, the mystery of feathers and flight, working with bird medicine, and so on.<br /><br />This is a book I've referred to consistently over the years, and highly recommend to anyone wanting to understand-and connect with-the animal kingdom.<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of [[ASIN:1571745874 The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present]] (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)ook, or even in a dream--I then get out Andrews' book and see what messages the creatures may have for me.

Whether named All Hallows Eve, Samhain, Saven, or Halloween, these autumnal celebrations are often a mixture of Pagan, Christian, and American practices. Each year, Americans spend billions of dollars for Halloween festivities, including costumes, candy, and decorations.<br /><br />However, what are the origins of this holiday? What is the significance of jack-o-lanterns, black cats, trick-or-treating, and masks? Via her magic broomstick, author Silver RavenWolf takes the reader on a guided tour of Halloween history, customs, symbols, and lore in her book Halloween - Customs, Recipes, and Spells. From The Druids to the Romans, Colonial Pennsylvania to Ireland, RavenWolf searches for the roots of Halloween and examines celebration rituals from around the world.<br /><br />Featuring superstitions, crafts, recipes and spells, Halloween - Customs, Recipes, and Spells is a phantasmagoric travelogue through foggy cornfields and gravestones laced with cobwebs. RavenWolf shows readers how to honor and contact the dead-including a pagan funeral rite-as well as how to construct divinatory tools for Guidance.<br /><br />Some of the fascinating offerings you'll find in this book include:<br /><br />* Superstitions and symbols of pitchforks, scarecrows, werewolves, vampires and bats<br /><br />* Customs such as bonfires, Halloween processions, masks and costumes<br /><br />* Divination methodology and instruction for casting lots, pumpkin seed divination for solitaries and parties, making a magick mirror, and Psychometry<br /><br />* Tempting recipes like Green Man cake, Toasted Pumpkin Seeds, Easy Enchanted Punch, Frosted Grapes and Honeyed Apples, and Sugar Snakes in Graveyard Dust<br /><br />* Magickal charm bags, pleasant dream sachets, corn husk magick, and pumpkin abundance lights<br /><br />* Harvest Moon ritual, Halloween defense spell, Samhain protection powder, and Jack-o'-Lantern protection totem<br /><br />* Spirit rattles and bowls, solitary Samhain ritual, ancestral altars, the dumb supper, offerings to the dead, and a simple ritual to receive answers from the dead<br /><br />Written in an engaging, playful style, Halloween - Customs, Rituals, and Spells takes the \\"scare\\" out of this oft-misunderstood holiday, and shows how Halloween can be a time for sacred ritual, family bonding, self-discovery and FUN.

Any mom who's ever carried three small children, a gallon of milk, and a jumbo bag of diapers across a crowded parking lot is a Mommy Yoga enthusiast.\\" - From the book<br /><br />As any Mom knows, bending, stretching, and contorting are all in a day's work. Whether doing the Monkey, the Kangaroo, or the popular Don't Make Me Stop This Car, Moms naturally morph into the roles her little ones need (demand!), and in the process, strike amusingly awkward poses.<br /><br />Mommy Yoga: The 50 Stretches of Motherhood is a hilarious book by Julie Tilsner highlighting the overextensions Moms face every day. Lavish, colorful illustrations by Susan McKenna accompany Tilsner's humorous prose, providing comic release for harried Moms.<br /><br />Some of the poses you'll find in Mommy Yoga include:<br /><br />Downward Fish - With feet firmly planted on the floor, bend at the waist and extend your arms into the toilet bowl. Scoop out all plastic toys. Rinse as needed.<br /><br />No Go - Dressed and ready to go to an appointment, hold baby on your hip and thrust one leg out the front door with confidence that, today, you'll be on time. Freeze and hold when baby suddenly throws up all over herself and you. Breathe through your mouth. Regard now-smiling baby and turn, slowly, until you're back inside. Resolve to repeat pose in fresh clothes, or finish up by reaching into your purse for your cell phone.<br /><br />Horse/Downward-Facing Frog - Start on your hands and knees, eyes looking down. Lower your body to the floor to allow one child onto your back for Horse pose. Let their weight smash you to the floor with your arms and legs splayed. Hold for 5 minutes or until your spouse comes (to) your rescue.<br /><br />Laugh-out-loud in some parts, the book Mommy Yoga serves as a delightful tribute to the balancing act of Motherhood. Moms of young children will no doubt think or say \\"Oh my God, that is *so* true!\\" At least, I did!<br /><br />This would make a lovely gift for new Moms, as well as a gift for Mother's Day. Mom's of small children will be amused no matter *what* holiday or occasion it's received!<br /><br />Note: I was all set to give this book 5 stars, but while reviewing it, I noticed that the Horse/Downward Yoga page omits the word \\"to\\", which I put in parenthesis above. It's a shame that this charming book is marred by such a glaring editorial oversight.ung children will no doubt think or say \\"Oh my God, that is *so* true!\\" At least, I did!  <br /> <br />This would make a lovely gift for new Moms, as well as a gift for Mother's Day.

Its nurturing care means that we are empowered and blessed with the elements and lessons necessary for our individual growth. In this respect, the message that you have chosen intuitively in this book may be one that your Higher Self wishes to send you.\\"  -- From the book<br /><br />Bibliomancy is a form of divination that uses sacred books to obtain answers to questions. Derived from the Greek word biblos, which means paper or book, this form of oracle can be used with virtually any book. Lately, there have been several books created specifically for bibliomancy, and Angel Answers - A Celestial Oracle is one of them.<br /><br />The messages contained within Angel Answers came to the author as sudden flashes of inspiration. She characterizes these messages as \\"inner vibrations, which I then tried to express in words.\\" Acknowledging that she is not the \\"true\\" author of this oracle, Nakamori credits a multitude of angels for granting her this most special, spontaneous gift.<br /><br />You can use this book two ways to receive an oracular angel message:<br /><br />1. Ask a question and open the book at random<br /><br />2. Send a question to the Universe, wait, and whichever number between 1 and 174 comes to you, open to that page<br /><br />Some of the celestial wisdom you'll find in Angel Answers includes:<br /><br />* Cheer up others with your wit and charm. Encourage them with kind words.<br /><br />* Jealousy and attachment do not resonate with the vibration of the Source of love. Understanding and tolerance are at one with the Source.<br /><br />* Do not be afraid to reveal yourself. You will be rewarded with true freedom, like a naked child swimming in the ocean.<br /><br />* Your mission in life changes according to the level of your inner growth. Your current mission is to do as much as you are capable of doing now.<br /><br />* Allow the Universe to love you, to guide you and to support you. Always keep the door of your heart wide open.<br /><br />I have used other books created for bibliomancy, and they have been a big disappointment-serving as mere quote books (and uninspiring ones, at that.) However, I have used Angel Answers - A Celestial Oracle several times already, and each time I received clear, comforting Guidance. I highly recommend this accurate book if you have an affinity for angels or if you're looking for a book designed to be an oracle.eep the door of your heart wide open. <br /> <br />I have used other books created for bibliomancy, and they have been a big disappointment-serving as mere quote books (and uninspiring ones, at that.)

The premise on which men rule the world is religion, with monotheism the form of religion that is bringing us to the brink.\\" - From the book<br /><br />According to author Jean Shinoda Bolen, M.D., the legacy of patriarchal history is competition, domination and control. Patriarchal religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam are hierarchical in nature, sanctioning war against each other and claiming divine superiority and favoritism. Patriarchy revels in the humiliation of enemies and amassing bigger and badder toys-nuclear missiles being the epitome-while women, children, and the planet suffer from male egos run wild.<br /><br />Bolen, a psychiatrist and Jungian analyst, steps into the role of mother bear in her newest book Urgent Messages from Mother: Gather the Women, Save the World-declaring, \\"Enough is enough!\\"<br /><br />Invoking the archetypes of Mother and sister/Artemis, Bolen rings the alarm bell as Earth heads towards certain disaster.  Unless women rise up, empower others, and lend their voice, she asserts, the vulnerable will continue to pay the price for patriarchal values.<br /><br />Citing numerous sociological and psychological studies, Bolen shows how-in general-women and men think, behave, and communicate quite differently. For example, stress triggers the \\"flight or fight\\" response in men, resulting in isolation and aggression. Women, however, react to stressful conditions with a \\"tend and befriend\\" response. Females seek social contact and support, as well as protect and nurture their young. Adrenaline and testosterone promote the \\"flight or fight\\" response, while estrogen and oxytocin promotes calm, relaxation, and maternal feelings.<br /><br />Because of hormonal differences, most women find it stress reducing to admit a mistake or discuss a problem. For them, such problem solving generates ideas, support, and possible resources. For most men, however, there is a hierarchal structure of one-up or one-down. Beginning in the schoolyard, boys learn that asking questions or looking \\"weak\\" begets derision, humiliation, and exclusion. Interestingly, this is why men often don't ask for directions when lost. Projected on the global scale, however, these differences are even more obvious. Women tend to seek compromise and consensus, pursuing what is best for all people-especially the vulnerable. Men, however, often seek to dominate, conquer, and \\"be right\\"-with grave consequences.<br /><br />Using biblical examples like Cain and Abel and the Great Flood, Bolen paints a chilling portrait of what happens when patriarchal spirituality perpetuates unquestioned. She writes:<br /><br />\\"Through a psychological lens, the image of the Lord is of a controlling father who overreacts and justifies what he did by blaming the children for bringing it on themselves. Living with an authoritarian father, children learn never to question anything and to accept his rules and punishment.\\"<br /><br />When God takes the role of authoritarian father-with males made in his image-women are devalued as belonging to an inferior gender. In fact, the women and children suffer the most from fundamentalist religions who stress male dominance, conquest, and moral, spiritual superiority. Discrimination, genital mutilation, and domestic violence are just a few forms of suffering caused by this kind authoritarianism.<br /><br />With humor, candor, and compelling anecdotes-as well as various scientific studies-Bolen establishes the differences between patriarchy and its opposite, egalitarianism. She traces the effects of established patriarchal beliefs and attitudes on societies and individuals, including how the erasure of the feminine face of God has contributed to violence, war, and poverty. Affirming that women in general have qualities needed for the surviving and thriving of the human family and the planet, Bolen points to two antidotes:<br /><br />1. The visible power of women together<br />2. The invisible power of women's circles<br /><br />Building on previous books such as The Millionth Circle, Bolen offers gripping historical, cultural, and theological insights about the Sacred Feminine as well as practical advice for bringing the feminine principle into consciousness.  It is not too late to change direction, helping to heal Mother Earth, our human family, and ourselves:<br /><br />\\"It is time to `gather the women'-for only when women are *strong together* can women be fiercely protective of what we love. Only then, will children be safe and peace a real possibility.\\"<br /><br />Considering the mess the planet and its inhabitants are in, what do we have to lose by promoting, engaging, and honoring the feminine principle?nts to two antidotes:    1.

How can it be forgotten when the change in the air, the turning of the leaves, and the shortening days are doing everything possible to catch your attention?\\" - From the book<br /><br />The Autumn Equinox is an enchanting time of year. As the days get shorter, the clime turns cooler and leaves burst with color-their last hurrah before withering. Hues of orange, russet, gold, and auburn adorn the landscape, hearth, and home. Folks gather the fall crops, celebrate the harvest, and offer thanks for family, friends, health, and bounty.<br /><br />Mabon, Feast of Avalon, Festival of the Vine, Harvest Home-there are many names for the magickal holiday that celebrates the Autumn Equinox. Ellen Dugan, commonly known as the \\"Garden Witch\\", has written an engaging new book examining this \\"forgotten\\" Sabbat. Autumn Equinox - The Enchantment of Mabon shows you how you can make the most of this time of year - imbuing sacredness, fun and creativity in both solitary and group celebrations.<br /><br />Taking a fresh look at the fall season, Dugan shares personal anecdotes of family celebrations, provides tips on garden and moon magick, discusses the autumnal correlations for crystals, Tarot cards, planets and candles, and shares tempting recipes using seasonal fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />Autumn Equinox - The Enchantment of Mabon also features easy, inventive craft projects, over 40 holiday charms, spells and rituals, and several Pagan prayers.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the sections on harvest goddesses, gods of vegetation and vine, harvest legends, and the astrological energies of September. The author's description of Demeter and Persephone are especially engaging, especially as she offers her original take on just what Persephone may have really been thinking! After all, she asserts, Persephone was a goddess. Would she have *really* been a damsel in distress? Or was she actually pining for an exciting \\"bad boy\\" to take her away from her \\"ordinary\\" life? And could it be that she made Hades *work* (and work *hard*) for her affection?<br /><br />Some of the fascinating discoveries that await you in Autumn Equinox include:<br /><br />* Scarecrow folklore and magic<br />* Michaelmas, Oktoberfest, Holy Rood Day, and other harvest celebrations from around the world<br />* Autumn faery meditation<br />* Tarot and candle spells for Libra and Virgo<br />* Full moon solitary ritual: The Wine Moon<br />* Persephone, Pomona, Dionysus, Green Man, John Barleycorn, Herne the Stag King and other legendary figures and harvest deities<br />* Autumn in the garden (including 13 magickal fall plants, fall foliage enchantments, bulb planting charm, U.S. cold hardiness zone map, color magick with various trees, and much more)<br />* Herbal soap recipes<br />* Leafy luminaries, lighted fall garlands, grape wreaths and other easy crafts<br />* Harvest Deities correspondence charts for Autumn enchantments<br />* Recipes for harvest goodies like Rosemary Garlic Potatoes, Shoepeg Corn Casserole, Pumpkin Bread, Roast Pheasant, Vegetarian Spinach Lasagna, Apple Sauce Cookies, Harvest Apple Upside-Down Cake, and many more<br /><br />Although Autumn Equinox - The Enchantment of Mabon is geared towards Wiccans and Pagans, the author's engaging prose, creative tips, and witty insights weave a bewitching autumnal spell-luring in even non-Wiccans like myself. I found this book to be utterly charming-full of myth, magic, and mystery. Autumn is my absolute favorite time of the year, so I reveled in Dugan's enthusiasm as she shared personal stories, practical and sacred rituals, and harvest customs and legends. In fact, she has whetted my appetite for incorporating ritual and mindfulness in the everyday sacred, especially when correlated to the seasons and sabats.

The first, culled from Wiseman's imagination and written from a first-person point of view, pulls the reader gently into each experience. In the second perspective, the author offers her thoughts on what makes each subject a source of such pleasure.<br /><br />Why, exactly, do we need to be comforted? The author actually lists in the Appendix, verbatim, dozens of personal stresses for those who contributed to the book. Here are but a few:<br /><br />* Adapting to life as a widow<br /><br />* Not being \\"first\\" on anyone's list<br /><br />* Isolation<br /><br />* Marital difficulties<br /><br />* Not being in control<br /><br />* A husband that works all the time<br /><br />* Wishing my wife would stop smoking<br /><br />* Poor international relations and risk of world wars<br /><br />* TMJ and arthritis in my jaw<br /><br />* Having a stack of unpaid bills and only $5 in the bank<br /><br />* Kids!!! (a two year old screamer and a teenager)<br /><br />For example, Bobbie from Grants Pass, Oregon finds comfort by listening to his favorite music-very loud-when he wants to break stress:<br /><br />\\"I'm bored, bored, bored. Life has fallen back into a rut lately, and I need some sort of an uplift. When I'm in a funk like this, music always does the trick, flowing over my body like fairy dust, getting my life back on track. Enter Elton. My own body shocks me. It's moving, and I'm powerless to stop the growing urge to sway. Some CDs just defy grumpy, and he's done it again, good old Dr. John...\\"<br /><br />Organized alphabetically, A Patchwork of Comforts offers 70 comforts for the body, mind, and spirit and includes entertaining bits of trivia, recipes, and black-and-white photos throughout. A few of the comforts include:<br /><br />* Bath: Ahhh, alone at last<br /><br />* Daydreams: Going to the movies for free<br /><br />* Eating Out: No decisions, no cleanup<br /><br />* Golf: Challenge in paradise<br /><br />* Lists: Let you know where you stand<br /><br />* Orion and Family: Sky glitter starts a part in your heart<br /><br />* Peaceful People: Calm is contagious<br /><br />* Wheelchair Accessible: Getting in-and out-of everyday places<br /><br />* Yard Work: A chance to nurture<br /><br />Reflecting on her own life, the author muses how fears irrational, irrelevant, and debilitating has kept her from living life to the fullest. Often, we don't stop to examine the autopilot nature of our lives and the tension that's underneath the surface. Nurturing ourselves is not only kind, but also essential for balance and harmony. A Patchwork of Comforts indirectly reveals the nature of everyday stress and fatigue that sends us off-kilter and offers uplifting, practical solutions to life's pressures. If you're feeling overwhelmed by daily tasks, outside pressures, and conditions beyond your control, this book provides a calming, centering voice of comfort.this, music always does the trick, flowing over my body like fairy dust, getting my life back on track.

He valued religious experience, and a spiritual message lies at the heart of his philosophy.<br /><br />Amassing thoughtfully selected passages from Emerson's lectures, essays, sermons, books, poetry, and journals, editor Barry M. Andrews has created a rare anthology highlighting the brilliant mind and astute heart of one America's most beloved authors.<br /><br />Taking readers from January 1 to December 31, A Dream Too Wild is a thought-provoking and amazingly insightful daily devotional. Rather than brief quotes, the passages in this book reflect the full range of Emerson's thoughts on spiritual matters such as:<br /><br />* Self reliance<br /><br />* Nature<br /><br />* The Over-soul<br /><br />* Solitude<br /><br />* \\"Plain living and high thinking\\"<br /><br />* Ecstasy<br /><br />* Moral sentiment<br /><br />November 1, culled from Emerson's journal of 1833, says:<br /><br />\\"The universe is a more amazing puzzle than ever as you glance along this bewildering series of animated forms-the hazy butterflies, the carved shells, the birds, beasts, fishes, insects, snakes-and the upheaving principle of life everywhere incipient, in the very rock aping organized forms. Not a form so grotesque, so savage, nor so beautiful but is an expression of some property inherent in man the observer-an occult relation between the very scorpions and man. I feel the centipede in me-cayman, carp, eagle, and fox. I am moved by strange sympathies, I say continually `I will be a naturalist'.\\"<br /><br />At the end of each passage, Andrews poses a pertinent question. For example, at the end of the previous passage he asks, \\"Do you feel a kinship with the plants and animals? Do you sense `an occult relation' between `scorpions and man'?\\"<br /><br />A prolific writer, Emerson admits that he was not a systematic thinker. Rather, he strung thoughts together like pearls on a necklace, with each containing a \\"lustre\\", as he called it-a thought to ponder, a brief meditation to contemplate.<br /><br />In a Dream Too Wild, Andrews has done an admirable job compiling Emerson's timeless pearls of wisdom. Emerson once said of himself \\"I am an endless seeker with no past at my back\\", and this book appeals to the modern spiritual seeker-especially one that searches with an open heart and critical mind.he was not a systematic thinker.

It gives us tools to make real changes in our lives. This is because Tarot works in pictures, and pictures are very powerful.\\" - From the book<br /><br />Learning the Tarot can be a daunting task. These seventy-eight beguiling cards are laden with symbols, associated with the four elements (plus Spirit), and are often read reversed in addition to their upright meanings. For some, the sheer amount of information connected to the Tarot can be downright overwhelming.<br /><br />Tarot author Rachel Pollack, author of the renowned book Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom, has written an engaging new book designed for those just beginning their journey with the cards. Geared towards teenagers, Seeker - The Tarot Unveiled gives a brief overview of the origins of the Tarot, answers a few frequently asked questions regarding the cards (\\"Does someone have to give me my Tarot deck?\\"), and provides general upright and reversed meanings for each card.<br /><br />Pollack dedicates two to three pages to each of the Major Arcana cards, while the Minors get about a page and a half of exposition. Pictures of the Universal Tarot are used in the book (although the author often mentions the Rider-Waite-Smith renderings), and a sidebar provides at-a-glance associations. For example, the sidebars for the Majors detail:<br /><br />* Keywords<br /><br />* Astrological association<br /><br />* Musical Note<br /><br />* Gift (upright meaning)<br /><br />* Challenge (surprise events)<br /><br />The Minor Arcana sidebars show:<br /><br />* Keywords<br /><br />* Elemental Quality<br /><br />* Number Quality<br /><br />The Court card sidebars are similar to the Minors, except that court quality replaces number quality. For example, the Page of Swords court qualities would be young and energetic while the elemental qualities would be air and mind. Keywords for this card are caution, alertness, intelligence, study, and high principles.<br /><br />Pollack also dedicates three pages to the numerical patterns of the Minor Arcana and explains how these themes develop according to the suit and its own basic qualities. The end of book catalogues various 3-card spreads, as well as seven additional spreads using more than three cards (including the Celtic Cross). A few of these more complex layouts are spreads dedicated to special issues such as conflict, pressure, and sexual choice.<br /><br />Seeker: The Tarot Unveiled is a fine introduction for those unfamiliar with the Tarot, especially for females ages 15-17. Pollack distills her wisdom into manageable chunks, bolstering confidence in young readers. Those already familiar with the Tarot won't find much new here, but this book does provide solid, basic information for at-a-glance reference-especially with the helpful sidebars. Individuals over the age of 20 or so may tire of the references to SAT's, teen pressures, backpacks, boyfriends, and college choices.<br /><br />Pollack shows individuals the what of Tarot and, to some extent, the why. However, if you're someone who is serious about learning the Tarot and its traditional symbolism and correspondences-as well as  how to read intuitively and form your own card associations-then I suggest getting The Complete Tarot Reader by Teresa Michelsen, instead. Another good choice for teen girls is Maria Shaw's Tarot Kit for Teens.

Welcome to a way that requires no difficult skills, adds no new burdens, and accommodates all spiritual systems and life-styles. Welcome to all who want to do nothing-more often, more creatively, with joy, and without guilt. Welcome to one-minute retreats that can be yours at any time of the day or night.\\" - From the book<br /><br />According to author David Kundtz, a mindful posture centered from the quiet state of your being is *crucial* for any undertaking. In fact, he asserts, if we do not take the time to pause with purpose, disappointment and failure awaits us.<br /><br />In his book Quiet Mind, Kundtz invites us to do nothing-but to \\"do\\" it with purpose, meaning, and value. That is, to take time for ourselves, to rest, to find peace, to awaken, to remember, and to find ways to recognize what we may have forgotten, and how not to forget again.<br /><br />At 370-pages, Quiet Mind: One-Minute Retreats from a Busy World is brimming with dozens of meditations designed to promote thoughtfulness, calm, and quietude. The mini-retreats, one and a half to two pages long, feature a sage quote and Kundtz's wise and gentle commentary. At the end of each, the author offers one-sentence encouragement, inviting readers to observe life and apply the wisdom found in the meditation.<br /><br />Kundtz has organized these meditations under fourteen general categories, including:<br /><br />* Making Room for Life<br /><br />* Creating Opportunities for Serenity<br /><br />* Defining Your Values<br /><br />* Finding Peace at Work<br /><br />* Knowing Thyself<br /><br />* Awakening to Wonder<br /><br />* Giving Back to the World<br /><br />Under the category Finding Peace at Work, for example, is a meditation about Weariness. Beginning with a quote from Eric Hoff saying, \\"Our greatest weariness comes from work not done\\", Kundtz observes:<br /><br />\\"...what tires us most is not work, but the anticipation of work still to do. Here is a time when living in the present moment is vital. The past is gone, the future is a just a concept and a projection of our minds. All you have is now. It's all you need...\\"<br /><br />In the section Making Room for Life, a meditation called What's Going on Here begins with a quote by George Wilson: \\"Things are seldom about what they seem to be about.\\" Kundtz notes that all too often we narrowly focus on accomplishing a particular task that we overlook the obvious cause of pain and distress in those around us. He relates the story of a frustrated mother bringing her son to him for counseling. The boy refused to go to school, and neither the son nor the mother was very communicative as to possible causes. Kundtz couldn't figure out what was at the heart of the problem! When he suggested they come back next week the mother replied that they could not come back next week because they were moving across the country. Aha! At last, a window into the boy's world: he was grieving the loss of his friends and all things familiar.<br /><br />Quiet Mind by David Kundtz is a delightful book, providing a much-needed respite from overloaded senses, cluttered thoughts, and hurried lives.is a time when living in the present moment is vital.

In Blue Goes to School, the book follows Blue as she enters Miss Marigold's class, tries to find her cubbyhole, and performs a variety of tasks throughout the day.<br /><br />This book teachers thinking skills for pre-schoolers as well as manners. For example, Blue is painting a picture of her house and she needs purple for the door. However, Purple Kangaroo has used all the purple paint. Blue then thinks up a strategy of how to make purple paint (as opposed to throwing a tantrum like some kids would.)<br /><br />Another example is Green Puppy taking Blue's spot on the reading rug. Blue debates whether she should make Green Puppy move out of her spot or whether she should pick somewhere else to sit today. (Of course, she picks the latter!)<br /><br />Young homeschoolers may a bit confused as to why they don't go to a \\"regular\\" school like the characters in the story, but overall, this is a nice book introducing children to the concept of school and polite social interactions.	2005-09-01

These images, like the Hunab Ku itself, measure and move us and encourage us to embark upon our own sacred journey. The Hunab Ku lies at the very center of these images, reminding us to balance our intentions, to center our understandings, and to become more conscious of what ancient wisdom continues to teach all of us today.\\" - From the book<br /><br />Hunab Ku is an ancient Mayan symbol that represents the joining of opposites. Hunab means \\"one state of being\\" and Ku means \\"God\\". Masculine and feminine, analytical and intuitive, objective and subjective, yang and yin, conscious and unconscious, external and internal-the Hunab Ku speaks to the abyss between opposing forces and, in fact, serves as a bridge between them. The archetype of the Hunab Ku is the \\"space between\\" that reflects oneness with God and the unity of all things.<br /><br />The Mayans constructed several detailed calendars and these calendars reflected cycles of the Earth and humanity itself. After each cycle of 5,125 years, the \\"universe takes a deep breath and begins again\\", and according to the Maya Long Count Calendar, humanity is posed on the edge of a great unfolding of balance and understanding. Many have called this the Age of Aquarius, but the Mayans called it the Age of Itza-Age of Consciousness. Some interpretations have set the winter solstice of 2012 as the time marking a gateway to the galaxies where Hunab Ku-the great mover-will pulse and fill us all with intelligent energy.<br /><br />To help prepare humanity for this cosmic awakening, authors Karen Speerstra and Joel Speerstra have presented 77 sacred symbols that create an interactive system for learning, healing, and meditation. These 77 symbols are archetypes that are universal, arising from the collective unconscious. As visual metaphors, the symbols reflect, like mirrors, the patterns that are deeply imbedded in each one of us. These archetypes bypass the rational mind, arrive on the wings of synchronicity, and invite us to journey inward. Archetypal symbols like those presented in Hunab Ku can explode us into different dimensions of understanding, restoring balance, energizing creativity, and promoting healing if we but allow them entrance.<br /><br />The 77 archetypal images are organized into groups of seven color palettes, each reflecting the seven chakras. Eleven archetypal symbols are associated with each chakra, depicting the energetic pattern of the image as it relates to the seven energy vortices and their corresponding issues, gifts, and challenges. The lower chakras--represented by red, orange, and yellow-connect to the physical side of life. The upper chakras-represented by blue, indigo, and violet-connect us to the spiritual side of life. In the center likes a field of green which connects to both the heart chakra and the Hunab Ku. This area marks our central union with one another and joins the images of the body and the spirit.<br /><br />There are several ways Hunab Ku can be read:<br /><br />* Conventionally, from beginning to end, as a mini ancient art history tour<br /><br />* One color group of eleven images at a time<br /><br />* As an oracle where you ask a powerful open-ended question and then turn to a random page<br /><br />* Roll dice and generate random numbers for different types of intuitive readings<br /><br />* Use a pendulum to dowse the Hunab Ku symbol for numbers/images that speak to your questions<br /><br />Hunab Ku is an unconventional book that serves as a spiraling labyrinth of archetypal consciousness. The physical images span from Red 1 Great Bear (Solitude) to Green 39 Hunab Ku (Lover). The spiritual images span from Green 39 Hunab Ku (Relationships) to Violet 1 Unicorn (Unity). So one could move down a path towards the center (39) and then move back out towards the world again by passing through numbers 38 through 1.<br /><br />Here are a few symbols from the book:<br /><br />RED<br /><br />Scorpion (Conflict)<br /><br />Womb (Gestation)<br /><br />Ouroboros (Unconsciousness)<br /><br />ORANGE<br /><br />Mother (Intuition)<br /><br />Water (Movement)<br /><br />Giant (Control)<br /><br />YELLOW<br /><br />Star (Inspiration)<br /><br />Twins (Androgyny)<br /><br />Wheel (Change)<br /><br />GREEN<br /><br />Dolphin (Addiction)<br /><br />Healer (Wholeness)<br /><br />Phoenix (Hope)<br /><br />BLUE<br /><br />Teacher (Knowledge)<br /><br />Sound (Vibration)<br /><br />Magician (Journey)<br /><br />INDIGO<br /><br />Moon (Dreams)<br /><br />Wise Old One (Rest)<br /><br />Chalice (Quest)<br /><br />VIOLET<br /><br />Scarab (Manifestation)<br /><br />Double Spiral (Infinity)<br /><br />Crown (Reward)<br /><br />For each symbol there is a re-drawn color plate of a petroglyph, artifact, figurine, carving, wall mural, etc. These archetypes are from diverse areas such as the Americas, Africa, British Isles, Babylon, India and beyond. For example, Under Mystic (Violet 8), there is a picture of a stone labyrinth (1200 CE) from Chartres, France. For the Serpent (Red 7), there is a picture of the Great Serpent Mound (c. 1000 BCE) from Ohio, U.S.A.<br /><br />For me, one of the most fascinating elements of this 330-page book is the symbol readings in the back of the book. Each of these readings is comprehensive, combining a series of archetypes for an incredibly accurate and insightful reading. There's an Insight Reading, Work Reading, Rainbow Reading, Courage Reading, and The Bard: Telling Your Story. The authors provide easy to read charts if you want to generate numbers by throwing dice or by assigning number values to the letters of your name, for example.<br /><br />Frankly, I am amazed at the depth of this book. It \\"speaks\\" profoundly on so many levels. I was experiencing physical discomfort that left me feeling nauseous, discouraged and weak. Tarot didn't appeal to me at the time nor did any of my oracle decks. I remembered this book and randomly turn to a page. The symbol I was given, The Phoenix, directly spoke to my situation.

I felt as through a burden was lifted from my spirit. I kept meditating on it as I went to bed. Whenever I woke up through the night, I kept seeing the Phoenix.<br /><br />Amazingly, I woke up the next day with the troubling symptom entirely gone. It's been almost 24 hours and I still haven't seen a recurrence of this symptom.

Norbert takes a seat towards the back and, unfortunately, Francine and Buster begin to make assumptions such as \\"Norbert thinks he's too good for us.\\" In the lunchroom, Muffy calls him \\"Norbert the Nerd\\" behind his back, and Francine calls him stuck up. The voice of reason, Arthur says \\"Maybe he's just shy\\".<br /><br />Reflecting the unkindness that kids often show, Arthur and the New Kid show how things aren't always what they seem...and that assumptions can be terribly wrong.<br /><br />While I like the general message of the book, I'm a bit irked at how it's delivered. For example, Norbert begins whispering answers to Francine when Mr. Ratburn asks a question. Then, Norbert joins in a soccer game and deftly bounces the ball of his head.<br /><br />Of course, they all become friends at the end, but the \\"between the lines\\" message is that to be accepted, you have to do things for others and insert yourself in the social milieu. While I realize this is probably true for the herd mentality of most public schools, I'm not big on the idea that Norbert only gets a fair shake when he kisses up to the other kids.<br /><br />Only Arthur offers positive comments about Norbert while the others speculate that he's \\"rich\\" or a \\"snob\\" right off the bat-as if that is perfectly normal, and acceptable, behavior.<br /><br />Arthur and the New Kid is a Step 3 book from the Step into Reading series by Random House. Step 3 books are geared towards children in Grades 1-3 and features engaging characters, easy-to-follow plots, and popular topics. Step 3 Books are very good for children who are comfortable tacking new worlds and like to read on their own.<br /><br />On a positive note, this book features two pages of peel-off stickers that can be used with the book or to create an original story. Some words in the story are in blue font, which corresponds to some of the stickers.	2005-08-31

Bach believed that the root of all illness was mental and emotional issues, and his intention was to develop a method of healing which would treat the emotional and spiritual imbalances which lead to physical disease. He discovered the 38 Essences for this method of treatment in certain wildflowers.<br /><br />The Bach Flower Oracle is a set of 38 cards explaining the fundamental qualities of each essence, including weaknesses to be overcome and strengths that can be gained.<br /><br />These cards are quite small and plain, featuring information like:<br /><br />WILD OAT<br /><br />Life's Work<br /><br />Hidden potential<br /><br />Dissatisfaction<br /><br />Inner Conflict<br /><br />Self- Realization<br /><br />Fulfillment<br /><br />Clear goals<br /><br />HORNBEAM<br /><br />Mental Freshness<br /><br />Weariness<br /><br />Mental Fatigue<br /><br />Routine Life<br /><br />Spontaneity<br /><br />Vitality<br /><br />Clear minded<br /><br />While the Bach Flower Oracle is designed for your \\"Higher Self\\" to choose three cards for meditation and healing, I feel it best serves as an overview of the 38 essences to help individuals discern which essence/s they need-or as a set of flash cards for learning the Bach Essences and their corresponding issues. To choose these essences at random via a deck is a lot like lining up a series of over-the-counter medications and allowing your \\"Higher Self\\" pick which one you need. A lot of good information is out there regarding the 38 essences and the specific personality issues that they address. There is no need to leave your healing to chance when you can take responsibility for researching the essences and determining what you need. While the essences are non-toxic, some writers and Bach Flower Essence practitioners speak of a \\"healing crisis\\" that can be set off by a vibrational essence.<br /><br />While I suppose you can use this deck as an oracle, it just seems a bit silly to me. However, if you'd like the Bach Flower Essences at-a-glance, this deck does a good job of providing an overview of the corresponding issues.<br /><br />(To see 3 images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...] )is deck does a good job of providing an overview of the corresponding issues.

According to Tolle, when we connect to the stillness within, we move beyond our active minds and tumultuous emotions to discover great depths of lasting peace, contentment, and serenity.<br /><br />The Stillness Speaks cards features 50 quotations from the book. The deck comes in an attractive, sturdy flip-top box with a magnetic lid. The top of the box doubles as a frame which can be propped open to display your favorite inspiration cards for ongoing reflection.  Beautiful shades of purple grace both the box and the cards themselves.<br /><br />One side of the card is printed with a quotation from Stillness Speaks, while the other depicts one of nine themes:<br /><br />* Acceptance and Surrender<br /><br />* Freedom from the Egoic Self<br /><br />* Who You Truly Are<br /><br />* Silence and Stillness<br /><br />* The Stillness of Nature<br /><br />* Relationships and Stillness<br /><br />* Beyond the Thinking Mind<br /><br />* The End of Suffering<br /><br />* The Stillness of Eternity<br /><br />Some of the quotes you'll find in the Stillness Speaks deck include:<br /><br />\\"Suffering begins when you mentally label a situation as bad. That causes an emotional contraction. When you let it be, without naming it, enormous power is available to you. The contraction cuts you off from that power, the power of life itself.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sometimes surrender means giving up trying to understand and being comfortable with not knowing.\\"<br /><br />\\"When you live through the ego, you reduce the present moment to a means to an end. You live for the future, and when you achieve your goals, they don't satisfy you, at least, not for long.\\"<br /><br />\\"Bring awareness to the many subtle sounds of nature, the rustling of leaves in the wind, the falling of raindrops, the humming of an insect, the first birdsong at dawn. Give yourself completely to the act of listening. Beyond the sounds there is something greater: a sacredness that cannot be understood through thought.\\"<br /><br />\\"Envy is a by-product of the ego, which feels diminished if something good happens to someone or if someone has more or knows more than you. The ego's identity depends on comparison and feeds on *more*. It will grasp at anything.\\"<br /><br />\\"If you can learn to accept and even welcome the endings in your life, you may find that the feeling of emptiness that initially felt uncomfortable turns into a sense of inner spaciousness that is deeply peaceful.\\"<br /><br />If you enjoy the book Stillness Speaks, you'll appreciate having these inspirational quotes in a handy format. The attractive box with built-in frame is a nice touch and would make a lovely gift for those who enjoy contemplative and meditative quotes. For those unfamiliar with the book, you needn't have read it to benefit from the Stillness Speaks Inspiration Cards. Personally, I enjoy the Power of Now Cards more than the Stillness Speaks deck (even though the latter is prettier), but even so, there is great wisdom about stillness and surrender contained in these cards.<br /><br />(To see 3 images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])of listening.

Whether I read it, overheard it, or spied it in action, it was wisdom passed on to me. As the African proverb says, `You don't need to be tall to see the moon.' Just stand where you are. Sooner or later the moon will appear. Sooner or later I'll see the God in you.\\" - Rosemary Cunningham<br /><br />Several weeks after September 11, the magazine Spirituality and Health gathered submissions from its readers to create a piece on ways to nourish your soul. Readers were invited to reflect on their daily lives and to share the simple actions that nourished them. The magazine asked, \\"How do you feed your soul? Have you done something spontaneous on a particular occasion? Or do you have a daily ritual that deepens your connection to your essential self, to the world, and to God?\\"<br /><br />Responses came via e-mail from all over the world and many of them became a magazine article. Fifty of those responses are now contained in the book Fifty Ways to Feed Your Soul, edited by Rosemary Cunningham.<br /><br />At 80 pages long, this small hardback book features sepia color photographs and fifty ideas and practices that have brought some measure of comfort, connectedness, and clarity to a sometimes chaotic world. Here are a few of the nourishing tips you'll find in this book:<br /><br />Create Your Own Prayer Book<br /><br />\\"I use a black-paper spiral notebook and cut out pictures from nature magazines of peaceful scenes to create my own inspirational prayer book.

Specifically, Spiritualism & Clairvoyance for Beginners is an accessible practicum for \\"seeing\\" with the Third Eye and decoding the images and symbols that arise. In addition, Owens also teaches that intuitive information can be received through \\"clear hearing\\" (clairaudience), \\"clear smelling\\" (clairgustance), and \\"clear sensing\\" (clairsentience).<br /><br />Filled with fascinating historical and personal anecdotes about spirit contact, Spiritualism & Clairvoyance for Beginners provides progressive learning exercises on meditation, memory development, visualization, psychometry and symbol interpretation.

I'm not talking about whether or not you have a religious background or affiliation. I'm talking about being connected to the power of the Heavens-and bringing it right down here to Earth to use in your everyday life.\\" - Jean Slatter<br /><br />The idea of enlisting help from angels, saints, or spiritual helpers is not a new one. For example, some Christian denominations teach that angels or saints are more than willing to help humans in their everyday lives as they navigate the twists and turns of earthly living.<br /><br />However, many are disillusioned with formal religion in the new millennium and one result is the sense of being alone in the Universe. Yet, there remains a desire to connect with something bigger than the self-to believe that someone or something is looking out for us and is willing to help manage our lives.<br /><br />With war, terroristic acts, cruelty and suffering flooding 24-hour news channels and other media, it's not uncommon to hear jaded folks wondering \\"If there is a God, then why in the world is he asleep on the job?!\\"<br /><br />What hasn't been considered is that we are the proverbial hands, feet, eyes, and mouth of the Divine. Could it be that we \\"have not because we ask not\\", as Jesus taught? Violating free will is not in the plan of the Heavens, so then could it be that we must engage the spirits of creation on our behalf?<br /><br />In the book Hiring the Heavens - A Practical Guide to Developing Working Relationships with the Spirits of Creation author Jean Slatter makes a convincing case that not only are the spirits of creation ready to help us with the \\"real stuff\\" of life, but that it is our birthright and mission as extensions of God to joyfully wield the creative power of the Universe.<br /><br />To be sure, some are not ready to assume the posture of a creator because this in turn implies responsibility. But as Slatter states:<br /><br />\\"When we see ourselves as divinely sanctioned creatures, something quite amazing happens. The transformation is unmistakable. We live life from a different vantage point. We recognize our authority to summon the vast resources of the Heavens and all of the eager spiritual assistance that's available for everything we do. We discover that all conceivable problems can be solved by our connection to this incredible power. With this new awareness we can shape our lives purposefully, creating joy and fulfillment with such ease that it feels like a miracle. From now on our lives can be deliberate, joyful expressions of the infinite Source of all creation and possibilities. Heaven can finally be brought down to Earth.\\"<br /><br />Hiring the Heavens conveys a simple message that is found in other books and teachings, but is packaged in a fresh, accessible way. Slatter approaches enlisting help from the Heavens as a hiring process. Just as you might hire an interior decorator, a chef, a babysitter or an accountant, you can do the same with the spirit helpers. In fact, Slatter asserts that for every earthly \\"job\\" there is a spiritual counterpart waiting in the wings.<br /><br />For example, let's say your house is a disaster, the kids need to be taken to different extra-curricular activities and bills are sitting on your desk. You feel overwhelmed. The first thing you may choose to do is \\"hire\\" a spiritual organizer! Ask for organizational aid for accomplishing what you need to do (preferably with joy and grace intact!). You can even create a spirit committee with your Organizer at the helm.  Invoke a spiritual accountant to help you deal with the bills, a spiritual housecleaner to help you de-clutter and tidy up, and a spiritual chauffeur to get the kids where they need to go on time. Hold \\"staff meetings\\" and delegate tasks to the spirits of creation.<br /><br />Sounds too good to be true? All I can say is get Hiring the Heavens and try the process yourself! I've tried it several times (from a skeptical viewpoint) and I was amazed at how it worked. For example, I was looking through my media center trying to find a particular CD-ROM. After looking through several rows of CD's and CD-ROM's for some time, I remembered the concept of hiring the Heavens. I decided to try it out and said under my breath \\"I need a spiritual detective to help me find this software!\\" I no more got the words out and my eyes alighted upon the CD-ROM I needed.<br /><br />I couldn't believe it.<br /><br />I've tried it several times already, with amazing success. I'm building up my \\"hiring muscles\\" as it were, because I had lost faith in angels or spirit helpers over the years-mostly as a result of extreme difficulty (such as my first husband contracting leukemia, suffering for a year, and then dying.)  We were both Charismatic Christian pastors at the time, and actually *taught* the concept of sending angels out on assignment. To experience what we did left me disappointed and wary of any \\"help\\" from the heavens. However, I now realize that I needed some major paradigm shifts in the area of expectations, fear, life purpose, and the point of \\"Earth school\\".<br /><br />Hiring the Heavens is a 131-paged paperback and includes several \\"Committee Worksheets\\" in the back of the book. Also included are three \\"Angel Express\\" Cards issued from the Bank of Creation. Tucked onto the book flap and easily cut out for use, they are valid today/always/forever.iewpoint) and I was amazed at how it worked.

They need 8 tickets to win the grand prize and they collect the tickets by riding rides and playing games.<br /><br />The target age group says 4-8 and unfortunately, the information in this book spans that age gap. Most of the book is very simplistic, encouraging children to identify shapes like a star and colors such as green and orange. But at the end, Dora has collected 4 + 4 tickets...and she asks the child how many she has collected. In my opinion, if your child doesn't know basic shapes or colors, the math is way over his or her head. If your child can do basic addition, then color and shape identification is likely far behind his or her skill level.<br /><br />While the story is quite colorful and has a lot of potential, I was disappointed at the content. It's unrealistic that a child would win a grand prize at a carnival just for finding an empty seat on the Ferris Wheel and grabbing an orange ring on the merry-go-round. The story zipped by way too fast without much of a build-up to the \\"grand prize\\".<br /><br />My son has asked me to read this book to him several times since we had it, and that's a good thing as far as reading is concerned. I just wish this book would have been a bit more consistent as to educational level as well as been a bit longer (and logically sequential) like many other Dora books.	2005-08-18

I've created 101 different ways to do so that will enable you to tap into this vital resource-one that is deep within all of us and that can be harnessed and trained. All you need is a little help to *jump-start* it, so you can use it in every area of your life.\\" -John Holland<br /><br />Psychic medium John Holland, author of Born Knowing and Psychic Navigator, has created a 213-page book dedicated to encouraging individuals to access, cultivate, and ultimately trust their inner sense of knowing. Whether delivered through bodily sensations, emotions, inner-imagining (clairvoyance) or other \\"antennae\\", Holland affirms that every person has an inborn guidance system known as intuition. However, noticing, developing, and acting upon Guidance can be another story altogether!<br /><br />As a result, Holland has written a gift-book size introduction to the world of intuitive navigation called 101 Ways to Jump-Start Your Intuition. Each mini-lesson comes with its own affirmation or inspirational statement to complement and strengthen the 101 lessons. Some of these quick and easy lessons include:<br /><br />Strengthening Your Aura: As I strengthen my aura, only positive energy can enter my space, and only positive energy can go out.<br /><br />\\"When your aura is strong and healthy, it acts as a protective shield to help you stay emotionally and mentally strong and physically healthy, and also enhances your intuitive abilities. To strengthen your aura, maintain a balanced and healthy diet; try to get outdoors more often; breathe in clean, fresh air; exercise regularly; and go for a massage or bodywork. Take time to rest, relax, and meditate regularly. All of this will greatly assist in building your intuitive strength as your reinforce your precious aura.\\"<br /><br />Communication: I express myself clearly, and I do matter.<br /><br />\\"The throat center represents communication, expression, sound, and creativity. We have a habit of *not* speaking up, which can cause blockages. Humming, singing aloud (the shower is a great place for this), and chanting can assist in balancing this center, and the soothing color blue resonates with it. Imagine a beautiful blue sky before you, breathe in this color, and let it surround you and move through this center. Ask yourself, `Do I need to speak up or say something that needs to be said?' Express yourself!\\"<br /><br />Seeing What You Feel: Everyone and everything is made up of energy.<br /><br />\\"Psychometry means `measure of the soul'. It's the practice of holding someone's personal possession and then reading the object. It's as if you're sensing or seeing through your hands. Ask a friend for an object that belongs to someone else. Close your eyes and give off the information that's coming into your mind *before* your logical mind kicks in. What are you feeling? Are there any pictures, letters, words, or colors? Okay, now try holding someone's business card-and see what you feel!\\"<br /><br />Mindful breathing and visualizing the movement of light appear in quite a few of the lessons in the book, so Holland appears to be a big proponent of those exercises. He also includes lessons on the 7 chakras (including a diagram in the back of the book) and the energy of colors. In fact, a chart explaining the meaning of ten different colors is also included in the back of 101 Ways to Jump-Start Your Intuition.<br /><br />Some of the lessons seem repetitive, even using similar phrasing. Also, quite a few of the exercises seemed to focus on visualization and manifesting your desires. While Holland provides some sound advice in these general lessons, this book is geared more towards those unfamiliar with energy, chakras, intuition, and accessing inner Guidance.<br /><br />If you'd like quick reminders on how to center yourself, access intuition, and follow Guidance, 101 Ways to Jump-StartYour Intuition does the job. It would also make a lovely gift book for those curious about honing their psychic skills. If you'd like something more comprehensive, however, I'd recommend Trust Your Vibes: Secret Tools for Six-Sensory Living by Sonia Choquette.101 Ways to Jump-Start Your Intuition does the job.

It has enabled our `psychic circle' of friends to have lots of fun and given us all much food for thought. It is our sincere wish that you and your friends also find the quality of your lives to be enriched by your sessions with The Psychic Circle.\\" - Amy Zerner and Monte Farber<br /><br />For over a century, various forms of talking boards have been used all over the world, with the Ouija board probably the most well-known. Especially popular in Europe and the United States, these talking boards have been employed using simple items such as shot glasses and writings on paper. Others have been beautifully hand-crafted using various magical themes.<br /><br />One such modern talking board is The Psychic Circle created by Amy Zerner and Monte Farber, the foremost designers of award-winning personal guidance systems. Unlike plain, old-fashioned boards, this enchanting Magical Message Board features colorful artwork and a myriad of symbols. Old-style talking boards usually contained just the letters of the alphabet and Yes, No, Maybe. For those seeking guidance, the watching and waiting often proved fatiguing.<br /><br />However, because The Psychic Circle depicts an abundance of symbols and glyphs, more information is available at your (literal) fingertips! Using the Magical Message Indicator (often known as a planchette), one or more individuals place their fingertips upon the Indicator, ask a question, and then await a message from Spirit. Because of the many symbols and words on the Psychic Circle Board, insightful and accurate information can be conveyed in a shorter amount of time compared to the older style boards.<br /><br />Here are the symbols depicted on this attractive talking board:<br /><br />* The four directions (E, W, N, S)<br /><br />* The four elements (Fire, Water, Air, Earth)<br /><br />* The 12 signs of the Zodiac<br /><br />* Numbers 0-9<br /><br />* Letters A-Z<br /><br />* Eleven colors<br /><br />* The Ring of Planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, North and South Nodes)<br /><br />* The Ring of Words (20 words such as Yes, No, Maybe, Close, Wait, Hello, Open, and Look)<br /><br />* The Ring of Pictures (8 pictorial symbols: Artist Palette, Cupid's Heart, Yin/Yang, The Crying Eye, 4 Leaf Clover/Dice, Bags of Gold, Hot Air Balloon and Guardian Angel)<br /><br />A large 30 page glossy booklet accompanies the Psychic Circle, providing symbol keywords as well as detailed information on the various meanings of each symbol, how to conduct a session, and how to interpret symbol combinations. For example, the Crying Eye can mean sadness, loss, regret, pain, unpleasantness, release, and overwhelming emotions. The Hot Air Balloon can represent rising above a situation, gaining perspective, removing yourself, look at the big picture, and travel.<br /><br />When asking for further guidance about one of the Ring if Pictures (such as the Hot Air Balloon), you must ask the Psychic Circle which of the Four Elements applies. Detailed interpretations for all 8 pictorial symbols combined with *each* of the Four Elements is also given. For example, The Artist Palette combined with Air indicates the idea of creativity. However, this picture combined with Water would indicate the emotion of creativity.<br /><br />Explanations for each planetary body are also given, such as advice on how to act, how to pace yourself, and the stage of your action cycle.<br /><br />There's even a section titled Tricks of the Trade which gives you special tricks for interpreting Guidance. \\"Q\\" often means \\"ask a question\\", and \\"Y\\" often means \\"why?\\", for example.  Bags of Gold combined with the Earth element means real estate, while Other/Venus can indicate another lover or another woman.<br /><br />If you've always wanted to try out a talking board but found other boards too daunting or spooky in appearance,The Psychic Circle is a vibrant, user-friendly alternative. Rich in both color and symbolic information, this Magical Message Board can convey both profound, mystical messages as well as practical, everyday Guidance.<br /><br />Personally, I've not had any success with talking boards (the planchette won't move!), but that doesn't mean it won't work for you-especially if you're eager to use this method of divination.is a vibrant, user-friendly alternative.

Author Eckhart Tolle experienced a profound, instantaneous awakening and now shares his wisdom with millions across the globe both in person and through his books and audios.<br /><br />The Power of Now deck is comprised of 52 cards; the words on these cards were chosen by Tolle to convey the power of the book in a few short sentences. You can pick a card at random to contemplate its message, choose one daily and reflect on it throughout the day, or even pick a card once a week for meditation. Once you've worked your way through the whole deck, profound insights will permeate your consciousness, resulting in more joy and light and less trauma in stress. In fact, it's quite possible your entire life will change as a result of digesting and applying the wisdom found in The Power of Now deck.<br /><br />The 52 cards are divided into five themes:<br /><br />* Rising above thought<br /><br />* The joy of being<br /><br />* The power of being present<br /><br />* The power of now<br /><br />* Portals to the now<br /><br />The cards feature the same green and yellow color scheme as the book jacket, with the theme printed on one side and a piece of wisdom or experiment on the other.

Then accept the consequences.<br /><br />Observe How the Mind labels an unpleasant moment and how this labeling process, this continuous sitting in judgment, creates pain and unhappiness.<br /><br />Are You Worried? - Do you have many `what if' thoughts? You are identified with your mind, which is projecting itself into an imaginary future situation and creating fear. There is no way that you can cope with such a situation, because it doesn't exist.

But more importantly, it also shows that who you are is much more important than what you have or what you are able to give.<br /><br />This is Step Into Reading Level 2 book which means that it's geared towards pre-schoolers through Grade 1. For children who recognize some familiar words on sight and can sound out new words with help, I Love You, Mama! is just right for that level. Level 2 features basic vocabulary, short sentences and simple stories. However, this book from Random House is notably longer than its counterparts from Simon Says (who would categorize this book as Level 1).<br /><br />My son asks me to read this book pretty often and is learning to sound out words himself. All in all, a great book for beginning readers.	2005-08-04

The parent card gives you ideas on how to introduce the concept of time and money using both the cards and real-life experience.<br /><br />These cards teach children how to read both digital and analog clocks including how many minutes are in an hour and the meaning of the short and long hands on a clock. An example of one of the time cards shows a pocket watch showing 10 til 5; the back shows 4:50 on the face of a digital watch.<br /><br />The money cards feature pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters. Sometimes the front and back of each coin are shown. For example, one card shows the front and back of a quarter. On the other side, it says \\"Place your coins on the spaces to equal 50 cents\\". There are two circles where a child can place actual coins in the spaces provided, reinforcing coin recognition. Coin combinations and amounts are also depicted. For example, one card shows 10 nickels. The other sides says 50 cents, 10 nickels.<br /><br />Geared towards children ages 6 and up, School Zone Time and Money flash cards are a great way to introduce children to these concepts and then apply them to real world situations.

Water captures vibrations naturally. Even when these vibrations are in characters, or letter representing language, water shows us the energy they contain in the form of crystals. Water is attempting to communicate something to us. Negative emotions prevent the water from crystallizing. Positive emotions allow it to develop in beautiful hexagonal shapes.\\" - Dr. Masaru Emoto<br /><br />In the realm of energy medicine, it is believed that everything has a vibrational signature and those signatures either promote health or hamper it. Words and intentions have vibrational patterns whereas water is a medium that receives and understands even the subtlest of vibrations. With this assumption, Dr. Masaru Emoto has researched the effects of words on water crystals by capturing images via high-speed photography. His work, which was featured in the film What the Bleep Do We Know!? and in his book Messages in Water, shows how negative emotions prevent water from crystallizing while positive emotions allow it to develop in beautiful hexagonal shapes.<br /><br />After receiving many requests from his readers to produce posters of the water crystals, Emoto had chosen to create a set of oracle cards featuring the photographs so that they could be used for practical purposes.<br /><br />The Water Crystal Oracle is a 48-card deck that is divided into four sets of twelve cards with the themes of Healing, Wisdom, Power and Earth. One side of the card depicts a water crystal photograph while the other side features the theme of the card at top and a focus word in the middle. The 16-page booklet that accompanies the deck suggests several ways to use the cards including focused meditation, keeping a card under a glass of water for two hours and then drinking it, placing the Love and Gratitude card on your bath or shower wall to increase the hado (vibration) of the water, and for global prayer with the intentions of \\"I love you\\" and \\"Thank you\\" projected into the connected water of the Earth.<br /><br />Through Emoto's work, he realized the relationship between emotions and the organs in the body, concluding that vibrational disturbances negatively affect the body. However, the body's intrinsic vibration of health can be restored by giving a new external vibrational to cancel out the disturbance. Emoto than began to work with musician Alan Roubik to create music to balance the body. Thus, the Cards of Healing feature photographs of crystals taken after playing ten different melodies. Emoto discusses listening to the music while visualizing positive emotion and even lists the songs, but considering there is no CD that comes with the Water Crystal Oracle, this information seems out of place. There is no advice for the Healing Cards except for listing a positive emotion with which to work with and the negative counterpart to be released. Two examples are Pancreatic Hado (Sympathy/Self Pity) and Blood Circulation Hado (Bonding/Stress of Human Relations).<br /><br />The Cards of Power can be used to amplify or to honor something in your life. Some of the cards in the Power group include Prosperity, Hope, Prayer, Honesty, and Eternity. However, there are no oracular meanings given for any of these cards.<br /><br />The Cards of Wisdom and the Cards of Earth are really the only two groups that can be considered oracular. For example, the wisdom of the Happiness card says \\"What can we do to increase happiness in the world? Love ourselves!\\" The Harmony card conveys \\"There was once a spiritual awareness that attempted to raise the people's consciousness to pray for harmony in all things. Harmony is the greatest of virtues.\\" In contrast, the Earth Cards feature all four seasons as well as Sun, Earth, Dolphin, Stonehenge, Rainforest, Coral Reef, and so on. The advice of the Dolphin card says \\"Dolphins are our teachers of unconditional love. Focus on them when you need to connect withthis energy. Picture yourself surrounded by them in the ocean as you swim together surrounded by their bubbles of joy.\\"<br /><br />The Dolphin is the only animal included in the Earth cards. As an aside, I find it a bit amusing (well, maybe disturbing is a better word) that New Age folks elevate dolphins to mystical status, especially when these creatures are known for the calculated gang rape of female dolphins. They even have a secondary gang as back up-not to help the female, but to corner her to be raped.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Water Crystal Oracle deck is misnamed as are many nowadays. It functions more as a meditative and contemplative deck more than anything. If you're really into Emoto's work with water crystals or just want a deck for contemplating the effects of thought and intention on water, our bodies, and the world, then you'll likely enjoy this deck. The cards would also be useful for \\"charging\\" water with specific healing intentions.  However, if you're new to Emoto's work or want an oracle with substance, then you'd likely be disappointed with this deck.<br /><br />(To see 3 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])in the ocean as you swim together surrounded by their bubbles of joy.\\"    The Dolphin is the only animal included in the Earth cards.

He then profiles each sign, including how they deal with finance, career and public image, love and relationships, and home and domestic life. And that's not even the horoscope part!<br /><br />General trends for 2006 are given which includes each sign's overall forecast for health, home, domestic, and family issues, love and social life, finance and career and self improvement. Then the author breaks it down into month-by-month forecasts and details the best days overall, best days for love, best days for money, most stressful days overall, monthly career peaks, and monthly pleasure peaks.<br /><br />For example, I'm a Scorpio Sun and 2006 holds some big pay-offs for me as Jupiter enters my Sign. Because Saturn will be in my 10th House of Career, I'll also have to continue to work my butt off! My 7th and 11th Houses will be empty, for the most part, which means that intimate relationships and friendships won't hold much importance for me in 2006. The upcoming year also heralds creating a fun atmosphere at home (as if there aren't enough toys around!) and dealing with mood swings and volatile emotions (who, me?) in a constructive way. Looks like a wild ride for the year ahead!<br /><br />One thing I really liked was how the author describes Scorpios. Quite frankly, I'm so tired of reading about the over-sexed and vindictive stereotype.

Take away any one, and the little yellow pear tomatoes in my garden could not be.\\" -from the book<br /><br />Little Yellow Pear Tomatoes is a delightful 32-page book by Demian Elaine Yumei examining the universal circle of life through the innocent eyes of a young girl. Inspired by the author's youngest daughter (who really *does* love pear tomatoes)-as well as the Zen teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh-the little girl in the story marvels at all the energy and collaboration it takes to grow the tomatoes. From the earthworms who aerate the soil with their tunnels to her Mommy who weeds the garden, there are a lot of not-a-tomato things that are in little yellow pear tomatoes!<br /><br />Filled with lush, vibrant illustrations by first time Mom Nicole Tamarin, Little Yellow Pear Tomatoes follows the contemplations of a little girl who see that everyone and everything brings something essential to the fruits she loves so much. Because many things contribute to the growing of the tomatoes-her Daddy who plants them, the sun which grants energy, the lakes, rivers and oceans that supply the clouds with water, and even the hearts of stars-all things are inside every little pear tomato.<br /><br />Imbued with exquisite artwork and the gentle message of interconnectedness, Little Pear Tomatoes is a fitting book for such troubled times. Ever since we've gotten this book, my son has asked me to read it to him every night before bed. Interestingly, this month's picture on my kitchen calendar features tomatoes of all shapes, sizes and colors, so I was able to show my son pictures of actual yellow pear tomatoes. Admittedly, I hadn't heard of-or seen-these types of tomatoes until reading this book!<br /><br />While the Amazon recommendation says that this book is geared towards babies and preschoolers, the words are advanced enough to challenge the reading skills of 7-8 year olds in my opinion. This is no mere picture book.-8 year olds in my opinion. This is no mere picture book.	2005-08-04

The word bibliomancy is derived from the Greek word biblos, which means paper or book. Usually, bibliomancy is done with a sacred book, but can actually be done with *any* book. The user picks a line or passage from the text at random, and then applies it to the situation in question.<br /><br />Author Neil Somerville has taken this oracle a step further by creating a book called The Answers. This attractive hard cover book was written *specifically* for the purposes of divining via proverbs, maxims, and advice. The pages are not numbered, and the advice section is to the right. The left hand page merely depicts a finger pointing to the advice. A red satin ribbon bookmaker is attached to the book, which is a nice touch.<br /><br />Some of the maxims you'll find in this book include:<br /><br />* Keep Your Wits About You.<br />* By Doing, Important Doors Will Open.<br />* Consider Your Reasons More Carefully.<br />* Avoid Wishful Thinking. Deal With Situations As They Are.<br />* What Have You Got To Lose By Not Acting? If Little, Go Ahead.<br />* Be Hopeful.

Then I decided to look through the book to read more of the aphorisms and found them to be fluffy, trite, and uninspiring. The beauty of using bibliomancy with sacred texts or other weighty volumes is that passages often \\"speak\\" quite a relevant message related to the query, with intuition filling in the blanks regarding nuance. The idea of creating a book specifically for bibliomancy is a good one, but it would have to be filled with more profound wisdom and thought-provoking ideas than The Answers to be useful, in my opinion.<br /><br />If you're someone that is used to more profound forms of divination such as Tarot or I Ching, you'll likely be disappointed with this book. However, if you're looking for a handsome book as a gift for those curious about divination or for those who like to read and collect quotes and proverbs, The Answers may be just the book you're seeking.<br /><br />A great bibliomantic book, though, is Angel Answers: A Celestial Oracle by Juan Nakamori.

Read these secrets with an open heart. Apply the ones that resonate with you, and discard those that don't.

According to Dr. Dyer, the ten secrets for success and inner peace are:<br /><br />1. Have a mind that is open to everything and attached to nothing<br />2. Don't die with your music still in you<br />3. You can't give away what you don't have<br />4. Embrace silence<br />5. Give up your personal history<br />6. You can't solve a problem with the same mind that created it<br />7. There are no justified resentments<br />8. Treat yourself as if you already are what you'd like to be<br />9. Treasure your divinity<br />10. Wisdom is avoiding all thoughts that weaken you<br /><br />Five cards are dedicated to each of these ten principles. These glossy cards feature subdued art in basic pastel cards such as periwinkle, sky blue, pale yellow and salmon pink. On the front of the card, the principle is written at the top of the card with a brief sentence at the bottom. The back of the card elaborates on the theme with a meditation.<br /><br />For example, one of the cards reflecting the seventh secret \\"There are no justified resentments\\" says \\"Release the need to be upset with others\\". On the back it says: \\"Remember that anything you're filled with resentment, you're turning the controls of your emotional life over to others to manipulate.\\"<br /><br />Another card, depicting the ninth secret \\"Treasure your divinity\\", says \\"Know that you are a piece of God.\\" The back says: \\"You are a Divine creation-a being of light who showed up here as a human being at the exact moment you were supposed to. You are the beloved, a miracle, a part of the eternal perfection.\\"<br /><br />As with all of Dr. Dyer's wisdom decks, you need not have read the book the cards are based on to be able to use them.

The images in this deck depict the spiritual and religious concepts that were the foundations of European Paganism as once known to our ancestors.\\" -the authors<br /><br />Bestselling Wiccan author Raven Grimassi and High Priestess Stephanie Taylor have teamed up with award-winning Pagan artist Mickie Mueller to create a unique oracle called The Well Worn Path. More than just a divination kit, the 40 cards and 216-page guidebook serve as an introductory course on the Old Ways, and creates portals for mystical exploration, pathworking, magical alignment, and solitary rituals. The authors write in a sensible, gentle, and wise voice, like mentors on the Well Worn Path.<br /><br />There are four different uses for each card in this kit:<br /><br />Meaning: This section describes the basic meaning at face value.<br /><br />Teaching: This section reveals the spiritual teaching or religious significance of the concept presented in each card.<br /><br />Alignment: This section contains a guided imagery intended to promote a greater depth of awareness. Each card contains part of an ongoing story that will take you through a mystical journey presented on all 40 cards.<br /><br />Ritual: This section demonstrates how you can use the cards to perform your own solitary ritual, which is ideal if you require privacy or have limited space.<br /><br />I was immediately intrigued by the engaging art of artist Mickie Mueller, which is what initially drew me to the Well Worn Path. However, not being Wiccan, I had wondered if I would really be able to glean relevant Guidance from this deck. Having an affinity for earth-based spirituality and a familiarity with Tarot, however, proved to be the only background I really needed to use this deck effectively. Cards depicting the Pentacle, Moon, Air, Cauldron, Crone, Harvest, The Old Ones and Reincarnation are but a few of the familiar symbols and archetypes. Admittedly, some of the religious aspects were lost on me (for example, the Eight Fold Path card and the Cakes and Wine card), but most were recognizable to me in terms of symbol and practical spirituality. Other card themes include Familiar Spirit, Handfasting, Law of Three, The Rede, Broom, Summerland, Hearth, Voice of the Wind, Mother, Book of Shadows, Athame, Mother, Wheel of the Year, and so on.<br /><br />The Guidebook contains three spreads: The Cauldron Spread, the Pentagram Spread and the Crossroads Spread. After experiencing a troubling situation, I thought I'd try the Pentagram Spread using the Well Worn Path cards. I was truly amazed at how relevant they were and how they \\"spoke\\" to my situation-especially the Words of the Magus card which advises \\"to know, to will, to dare, to keep silent\\". The Guidance I received was clear, confirming, and comforting.<br /><br />At the end of the Well Worn Path Guidebook, there is a section on solitary rites, including the Rite of Inward Journey and the Solitary Full Moon Rite. The authors also explain how to use the card images for personal ritual, such as walking with the Greenman.<br /><br />One thing I noticed, however, is that the Table of Contents is off a bit. For example, the Pentagram Spread is said to begin on page 18, but it really begins on page 20. Also, there is a typo in the Table of Contents: The Solitary Rull Moon Rite (R instead of F in \\"Full\\"). This isn't a big deal as far as the usefulness of the kit, of course, but it bugs me when I see a major publisher allow editing/typographical errors in an area as prominent as the Table of Contents.<br /><br />Another thing that I must mention: I tried doing a one card reading a few days ago, and picked the Cakes and Wine card. While the message of integrating feminine and masculine energies made sense to me and imparted wisdom, I was a bit grossed out at this passage:<br /><br />\\"...The cakes and wine are the divine offering versus the mundane meal. Here the wine is the menstrual blood of the Goddess, the essence of the cycles of life...\\" If you only have a passing interest in Wicca/Paganism and are a bit skittish about all the \\"womb\\" talk, you may not be too thrilled with the Well Worn Path.<br /><br />The card backings feature a beautiful wooden door, as if beckoning the reader to discover the mysteries within. The 40 cards are of slick satin finish and are the same size as the cards from Llewellyn's recent releases (e.g. The Quest Tarot, Revelations Tarot, etc.) The Well Worn Path box set also comes with a cardboard box to store your cards, as well as a black organdy bag.<br /><br />If you'd like to deepen your knowledge of Wicca and Paganism through pathworking, reflection, divination, and ritual, the Well Worn Path would make a lovely spiritual tool. Those who are not Wiccan may still be able to use this oracle, especially ones who are comfortable with goddess and earth-based spirituality and those familiar with the Tarot.<br /><br />(To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)l blood of the Goddess, the essence of the cycles of life...\\" If you only have a passing interest in Wicca/Paganism and are a bit skittish about all the \\"womb\\" talk, you may not be too thrilled with the Well Worn Path.

Those who are not Wiccan may still be able to use this oracle, especially ones who are comfortable with goddess and earth-based spirituality and those familiar with the Tarot.

We \\"vibrate\\" a certain frequency according to our thoughts, emotions and beliefs-whether conscious or not. Some of these beliefs are inherited from previous generation, and these vibrational patterns create \\"matches\\" which are mirrored in our circumstances. So if an individual is creating a scenario they don't like, Dr. Northrup asserts that this circumstance was \\"created\\" by an unhealthy thought pattern.<br /><br />By becoming conscious of these patterns, we can change what is no longer working well and reinforce what is. Engaging inner wisdom coupled with openness to Guidance is the key to improving habits of thought, emotion, and behavior.<br /><br />Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom Healing Cards is a 50 card deck that was designed to be used as an oracle. If the deck is approached with the expectation of receiving Guidance, says Northrup, then \\"you'll always pick the cards that contain precisely the message you most need to further your personal growth at the moment.\\"<br /><br />The deck is divided into five \\"suits\\" which reflect five key life areas:<br /><br />* Fertility and Creativity<br /><br />* Partnership<br /><br />* Nurturance/Self Care<br /><br />* Self-Expression<br /><br />* Enlightened Heart & Mind<br /><br />These \\"suits\\" are show in pastels: sage green, pale yellow, lavender, mauve, and cornflower blue. The deck itself features shiny gilt edging, just like Doreen Virtue's Magical Unicorns Oracle Cards and Kat Black's Golden Tarot.<br /><br />Within each of the five \\"suits\\" are ten developmental steps that require mastery in order to progress in life or improve health. These ten steps are reflected in ten cards that remain the same for all five \\"suits\\". These ten developmental steps are noted on the bottom of the cards, accompanied by roman numerals:<br /><br />I  Imagine/Allow<br /><br />II  Prepare<br /><br />III  Flexibility Within Structure<br /><br />IV  Hierarchy vs. Partnership<br /><br />V  Perfection vs. Imperfection<br /><br />VI  Risk vs. Safety<br /><br />VII  Active vs. Passive<br /><br />VIII  Channel Clearly<br /><br />IX  Regroup<br /><br />X  Complete and Move On<br /><br />So let's say you draw the number VI Risk vs. Safety card from the Enlightened Heart and Mind suit. The advice is:<br /><br />\\"New ideas and ways of doing things are often threatening to the status quo. Have the courage to advance your ideas despite the resistance of others. Do so with an open heart and compassion for the point of view of others.<br /><br />Risk keeping an open mind and heart, despite the opinion of others.<br /><br />Image Note: This image shows riders departing the safety of their village and negotiating a narrow path at the edge of a cliff. Likewise, you must sometimes take similar risks to chart new territory for yourself and others.\\"<br /><br />The images on the front of each card are impressionistic in nature and derived from the work of a master artist. According to Northrup, the images were chosen for the archetypal quality and classical style, not for the historical meaning or intentions of the painter. The card backing is lovely, depicting layers of wings in blue/green hues.<br /><br />The 72-page companion booklet also features eleven different spreads (card layouts) which is quite surprising. Most Tarot guidebooks don't even give you that many spreads! And they are comprehensive ones, delving into life purpose, family dynamics, chakra health, abundance, and more.<br /><br />There's a lot of good information in the Women'sBodies, Women's Wisdom Healing Cards, but I'm not sure how good it is an actual oracle-as opposed to a healing/meditation deck. I tried doing the 4-card Conditional Health Reading and it wasn't accurate at all. The \\"issues\\" and \\"advice\\" didn't resonate at all. For example, Card 4 advised \\"Become a life long learner. Expose yourself to new ideas. Take classes regularly. Resolve to remain teachable throughout your life.\\"<br /><br />As an avid reader with a love of learning, this advice was totally irrelevant to me-as was the other three cards. If anything, I could use a break from all the exposure I get from reading, listening to audio courses, practicing/learning divinatory arts such as Tarot, etc.!<br /><br />It would have been nice to have had modern illustrations on these cards, as is found on most Hay House decks, rather than paintings from \\"masters\\". Despite Northrup's assertions, I don't feel the pictures themselves conjure up much intuitive information. Most of the cards feature naked women and seems more like a tour through an art gallery rather than a health and healing oracle. Still, the information contained in the booklet offers sage advice, and the spreads could be used with any oracle or Tarot deck-not just this one.<br /><br />It really depends on what you're looking for, but for me, the Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom Healing Cards didn't \\"speak\\"\\" to me and I didn't find the card images all that attractive, either.<br /><br />(To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])and \\"advice\\" didn't resonate at all.

The Aztec people, known as the Mexica, had a very balanced relationship with the animal world. They viewed animals as sacred beings that shared the Earth with the gods long before humans were created.\\" -the authors<br /><br />The Aztecs viewed animals as sacred beings that dwelled among the gods, pre-dating the creation of humans. The Mexicas, as the Aztecs were known, believed that the gods sent them messages via animals. If a particular bird or animal would cross their path, they would often consult a priest for help in interpreting these omens. They identified with the animal world to such an extent that they believed each individual had a twin animal soul, called a Nahualli. On the fourth day of a child's life, a priest would perform a ritual, enjoining the human soul with the Nahualli for life.<br /><br />The consecration and dedication was based on a child's birth date and time. The animal would aid in character development and provide protection. In turn, the child would forever protect the Nahualli. If someone were to enter the priesthood, his or her Nahualli would impart \\"supernatural\\" abilities such as shape shifting, astral projecting, healing and so on-based upon the actual behavior and temperament of the animal.  In the Nahualli Animal Oracle, authors Caelum Rainieri and Ivory Andersen have created a way (based on actual Aztec rituals) for individuals to determine their own personal Nahualli, which includes a birth chart. If you don't know the day you were born on, the book provides a website URL so you can look it up.<br /><br />For example, I was born on a Friday so according to this day-coupled with the time of my birth-my Nahualli is the Owl. The Owl is associated with death and the underworld, and as an 8th House Scorpio Sun (with stellium), I found this interpretation to be a good match-especially since Pluto, god of the underworld, rules Scorpio.<br /><br />One can also discover his or her Nahualli using the 40 cards in the Nahualli Animal Oracle by intuitive, random selection. I tried this method before I discovered the day of the week I was born on, but it didn't resonate with me.<br /><br />The author's intention for the Nahualli Animal Oracle is threefold:<br /><br />1. To improve understanding, respect, and appreciation for animals as unique emotional and spiritual individuals<br /><br />2. To honor the Aztec civilization for its many accomplishments<br /><br />3. To resurrect an authentic oracle of the Aztec religion as an instrument for obtaining wisdom, guidance, and insight into everyday affairs.<br /><br />The 183-page Guidebook provides a wealth of information on Aztec cosmology and ritual, including general rules of Nahuatl pronunciation, deity pronunciation key, the Aztec pantheon, and Aztec numerology. Also included is a comprehensive description of each card's primary energy (upright) and contrary/negative energy (reversed), as well as keywords. Nine of the cards are Aztec deities, while the rest are animals. A thorough treatment of the history, lore, and significance to Aztec spirituality is also provided for each deity and animal.<br /><br />Five comprehensive spreads are discussed at the end of the book:<br /><br />* The Smoking Mirror Spread<br /><br />* The Three Graces Spread<br /><br />* The Ball Court Spread<br /><br />* The Five Directions Spread<br /><br />* The Pyramid Spread<br /><br />I tried the Smoking Mirror Spread in the attempt to learn more about my personal Nahualli, but as I mentioned before, it didn't resonate with me. One of the spreads, The Ball Court, is particularly macabre: Apparently, Tlacho was a game that the Aztecs played and was designed with \\"celestial orientation in mind\\". At the end of the game, the blood of the players would be offered to the gods and the captain of the losing team was beheaded as a sacrifice to the presiding deities.<br /><br />The religion of the Aztecs was based on warfare and human sacrifice. According to the authors, the Aztec warriors-garbed in brilliant clothing representing Eagle, Jaguar and Coyote-engaged in non-stop conquest. Their fueled the Aztec economy with their plunder, and used the prisoners for their sacrificial altars. The more than 400 Aztec gods had a voracious appetite for human sacrifice, and the Aztecs were more than willing to supply them with fresh blood.<br /><br />With this in mind, I couldn't help but wonder \\"Now, why, exactly, are we honoring such a violent, bloodthirsty culture?\\" I found the lore a bit gruesome for my tastes, and while the 40 cards of the Nahualli Animal Oracle are quite colorful and attractive, they didn't \\"speak\\" to me.

According to artist and author Francene Hart, Sacred Geometry in an ancient science and a sacred language-a study of shape and form, wave and vibration, microcosm and macrocosm. It is geometric archetypal patterns that gather and repeat, echoing the oneness of All That Is.<br /><br />Sacred Geometry also serves as a bridge between the left and right brain, the Yang and the Yin. This \\"blueprint for all creation\\" is a complex informational system-a vehicle to transcend duality consciousness, move beyond third-dimensional reality, balance human energy fields, and evolve consciously.<br /><br />After years of studying the wisdom of ancient mystery schools and secret societies-as well as receiving and heeding intuitive Guidance-artist Francene Hart created the Sacred Geometry Oracle Deck as a means for accessing the holographic view of past, present and future. Her intent is for individuals to find their personal place in this holographic universe and gain insights that are outside the scope of the rational Western model.<br /><br />The Sacred Geometry Oracle Deck contains 64 cards, each with a specific theme. The expression of this \\"language of light\\" is through shamanic-like illustrations, familiar geometric patterns, spiritual symbols, and simple shapes. Some of the cards and themes in this deck:<br /><br />* Vesica Piscis - Birth Portal<br /><br />* Sri Yantra - Meditation<br /><br />* Square - Earth, Male<br /><br />* Medicine Wheel - Connection to Nature<br /><br />* DNA - Conscious Evolution<br /><br />* Leonardo's Vitruvious Man - Divinity of Humankind<br /><br />* Dodecahedron - Divine Thought<br /><br />* Earth Grid - Fellowship<br /><br />* Kabbalah - Tree of Life<br /><br />* Steam Cave - Elemental Forces<br /><br />This boxed set also includes a 143-page companion book, which features seven spreads-described at length-and a comprehensive treatment of each card in both the upright and reversed position. Some cards are symmetrical and harmonious, and thus mean the same thing upright and reversed.<br /><br />Every time I've used the Sacred Geometry Oracle Deck, I have found it to be amazingly insightful and accurate-regardless if I used the cards in a complex spread or just for a one card meditation. In my experience with Cartomancy, I have found that when one individual creates both the images and divinatory meanings of an oracle or tarot deck, it somehow carries more intuitive \\"weight\\". Perhaps because the years of study and wisdom are infused into the whole of the oracle-both art and meaning-this combination really packs a wallop in terms of delivering clear, powerful Guidance. The Sacred Geometry Deck is no exception.<br /><br />If you enjoy exploring the realm of Sacred Geometry and are seeking integration, balance, and increased awareness, this deck and book will be a wonderful companion on your journey to conscious growth and personal empowerment.<br /><br />(To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Oracle Decks section at [...])ah - Tree of Life    * Steam Cave - Elemental Forces    This boxed set also includes a 143-page companion book, which features seven spreads-described at length-and a comprehensive treatment of each card in both the upright and reversed position.

As the divinatory meanings start to unfold automatically, the images will soon start to feel like old friends.\\" -Juliet Sharman-Burke<br /><br />The Tarot Workbook was created for tarot readers eager to increase their knowledge of the cards and improve their ability to read them. This fun book features 78 blank card images for you to color in any way you desire: crayons, markers, colored pencils, etc. While the blank images are based on the Sharman-Caselli deck, the Tarot Workbook can be used with any set of Tarot cards.<br /><br />By engaging the archetypal symbols and themes directly-through coloring the images and choosing a personalized color scheme-we approach the cards in a less intellectual, more intuitive way. According to Sharman-Burke, this is exactly the approach needed to unlock the secrets of Tarot.<br /><br />The author takes a few pages to describe the Minor Arcana, the four elements, the symbolism of numbers 1 (Ace) through 10, Court Cards and the Major Arcana. Although she doesn't spend much time on theory, what she *does* share is packed with solid, helpful insights.<br /><br />The Tarot Workbook features a coloring exercise and a personal association exercise designed so readers can form a more intuitive, personalized rapport with the Tarot.  For example, with the Ace of Pentacles, Sharman-Burke asks us to think about the earth and all aspects of the earthy element-and to consider the different types of flowers and what they may represent (e.g. roses for passion, lilies for purity). She then encourages us to reflect on our own experience with matters of finance-what money means to us, how we use it, and how we would apply this to the Ace of Pentacles as a symbol of new beginnings.<br /><br />On the left side of the book is a brief overview of the card meaning and several comments by students of Sharman-Burke. It's interesting to read how individuals of varying age and life experience interpret the cards. On the right side of the page is the blank image to color with about nine lines to record your impressions. The author divides this area into three parts:<br /><br />1. What this means in my life<br /><br />2. Readings in which it was significant<br /><br />3. Reading record sheet<br /><br />I didn't find the last two helpful, so I just whited out the text so I could have a blank paragraph to write what I wanted to. To the left and right of the card are white spaces dedicated to Name, Place, Date, and Time. Sharman-Burke doesn't explain what these are for, however. I got out the liquid paper, again, and just made them blank rectangles in which to write associations and key words.<br /><br />The front and back covers of the book feature glossy flaps depicting the entire Sharman-Caselli deck in full color. However, readers are encouraged to formulate their own color schemes and \\"bank\\" of card associations.<br /><br />The Tarot Workbook by Juliet Sharman-Burke provides an engaging, hands-on study which is *perfect* for kinesthetic (physical) learners or those wishing to approach learning the Tarot in a more intuitive, creative manner. By familiarizing yourself with card images in this way, a stream of information bypasses the critical, rational mind and bubbles into consciousness. Whether coming from the archetypal collective of the unconscious or personal experience, these associations become more solidified in the psyche of the reader.<br /><br />I'm really enjoying coloring the card images and writing commentaries on each card based on events from my life and from other symbolic, mystical disciplines.

This deck can be used individually or together with your partner to develop a better understanding of yourself as well as your relationship.\\" -from the deck<br /><br />The art of Sulamith W&uuml;lfing (1901-1989) reveals a hidden mystical world that captures the beauty and spirituality of darkness and light, fairies and angels, and otherworldly spirits. In the Lovers Oracle deck, Wulfing's imaginative art captures the many different elements of relationship.<br /><br />You can draw a card for guidance, or select one with your partner and discuss the message in the context of your relationship. The Lovers Oracle features 40 colorful paintings by Wulfing on one side, with a black and white illustration and message on the other.<br /><br />Some of the quote found on the cards:<br /><br />\\"It is better to be hated for you are than loved for what you are not.\\"<br /><br />\\"If you love something, let it go. If it comes back to you, it was truly meant to be.\\"<br /><br />\\"If each time I thought of you were a flower, I could walk in my garden forever.\\"<br /><br />\\"Love will die if held too tightly; love will fly if held too lightly.\\"<br /><br />\\"The love from the soul is wholly without condemnation; it sees imperfection, but because of what it sees, more love flows.\\"<br /><br />While many of the quote are wise and inspirational, they are too light-weight to truly be oracular. I can see the Lovers Oracle working very well for those contemplating the nature of relationships and love, but it won't offer much in terms of comprehensive guidance like many oracles. If you love the art of Sulamith Wulfing and the sentimental, romantic nature of love, you'll enjoy this pretty deck.<br /><br />(To see 6 images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])	2005-07-13

The back of the cards feature a black and white illustration with a brief saying intended for oracular use. Some examples include:<br /><br />\\"Every new beginning has a protective magic that helps us to grow.\\"<br /><br />\\"The moment you are following somebody else, you are no longer following the truth.\\"<br /><br />\\"As many souls, as many pathways to God.\\"<br /><br />\\"It is an old, ironic habit of human beings to run faster when we have lost our way.\\"<br /><br />\\"Be careful not to become so heavenly that you are useless on earth.\\"<br /><br />There is no booklet or guidebook that accompanies this deck.<br /><br />While the Fairy Oracle images are cute, the cards as an oracle aren't particularly deep.

However, if you like looking at pretty pictures, enjoy daily inspiration, and have an affinity for nature spirits, you'll likely enjoy this delightful deck.<br /><br />(To see 6 images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])	2005-07-13

While the deck is supposed to help individuals understand the nature of angels and how they help with human problems, the sayings on the back are merely inspirational or motivational quotes culled from other sources. Also the deck references God as a \\"he\\" which may be unworkable for those who view the Divine as a she or genderless. Also, the sayings often mention devils or evil, which doesn't jive for those leaning towards non-dualistic, non-Christian spiritual paths.<br /><br />Some quotes include:<br /><br />\\"When the angels appear, the devils vanish.\\"<br /><br />\\"Life vibrates. It does not move.\\"<br /><br />\\"We learn that God is, that He is in me, and that all things are shadows of Him.\\"<br /><br />\\"On the spiritual life, all paths lead to the same place.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Angels of Death are full of grace and love.\\"<br /><br />\\"Belief in not truly belief while doubt can still touch it.\\"<br /><br />The sayings on the Angel Oracle cards are pretty shallow, so this deck isn't really suited as an oracle in my opinion. Also, there is no booklet that accompanies this deck.<br /><br />If you love Wulfing's artwork--which is quite beautiful--you'll no doubt love this deck. Likewise if you connect with the concept of angels and spirit helpers. If you're looking for a good angel oracle, however, you're much better off with a deck like Doreen Virtue's Archangel Oracle Cards.<br /><br />(To see 6 images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])	2005-07-13

During our times of individual and collective disorientation, many people have lost the connection with their traditional sacred images and are, therefore, lacking the healing energy we all need. The mandala can bridge that gap and present a new spiritual-emotional orientation that leads to understanding and well-being.\\" - Heita Compony<br /><br />The Sanskrit world \\"mandala\\" means holy or magical circle. According to author and artist Heita Compony, there are three central components to a mandala: the center point, the periphery, and the part that emanates from the center to the periphery. The center represents Mystery, the spiritual force that is the birthplace of all existence in time in space. The emanation streaming from the center towards the periphery-and back again to center-is the connection between the inner and outer worlds. Mandalas reflect the macrocosm and the microcosm-spirit and matter- serving as a multi-dimensional representation of both the finite and infinite.<br /><br />Mandalas can be found everywhere, especially in nature. The iris of the human eye, the blossom of a flower, the nest of a bird, and the web of a spider are but a few mandalas revealed by creation. Other forms include snowflakes, wheels, and even the spiral mandala of the Milky Way.<br /><br />In the Mandala Oracle, Heita Compony shares her visionary painting through 37 colorful cards. One side of the card features a vibrant mandala painting, while the other displays a quote from women such as Mother Theresa, H.P. Blavatsky, Helen Keller, Indira Gandhi, Elizabeth Barrett Browning and others.<br /><br />A few of the quotes include:<br /><br />\\"Spirituality is a kind of virgin wisdom, a knowing that comes prior to experience.\\" -Marilyn Ferguson<br /><br />\\"The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any\\" -Alice Walker<br /><br />\\"All the way to heaven is heaven.\\" -Saint Catherine of Siena<br /><br />\\"Everybody knows if you are too careful you are so occupied in being careful that you are sure to stumble over something.\\"<br /><br />Here is how to use the Mandala Oracle:<br /><br />1.

The wise approach is to realize that it's a lifestyle requiring constant attention to the well-being of your mind, body and spirit. Of all the many factors that healing and living a healthy life require, becoming an empowered individual is the most important. That's also the most difficult.\\" - Caroline Myss<br /><br />According to medical intuitive and spiritual teacher Caroline Myss, personal empowerment first begins with the choices we make. Even small choices can have strong energetic reverberations that echo through both our bodies and our lives. In fact, she asserts that even one positive action can create an entirely new life.<br /><br />Crises such as illness, loss, and heartbreak often force us to begin the journey of personal empowerment. In the throes of such difficulty, knowing where and how to begin this quest can be a daunting task.<br /><br />With the Wisdom for Healing Cards, Myss provides 50 different lessons to help individuals ascertain personal energy levels and movement. In addition, her wisdom encourages body awareness, emotional self-examination, and spiritual connection to God.<br /><br />Myss' approach is a proactive one, with each card focusing on a specific lesson and goal. For example, in the card titled \\"Notice That Special Person\\", the lesson says:<br /><br />\\"On this day, take notice of someone whom you've previously ignored. That person is your teacher, your special angel, and he or she will do or say something you've been waiting for, just because you're recognizing the beauty of his or her spirit. Your goal: to see that everyone is capable of helping you heal, and vice versa.\\"<br /><br />The Wisdom for Healing Cards features the gorgeous, vibrant art of Janice Fried, the same artist who illustrated the Archetypes Cards and the other Healing Cards deck by Myss. Each glossy card has a colorful image on one side, and a lesson/goal on the other.

The depth of its wisdom, and the accuracy of its character analysis and prediction, have caught the imagination of the West in recent years and led to a rapid rise in its popularity.\\" -from Your Chinese Horoscope 2006<br /><br />In Chinese Astrology there are 12 signs named after 12 different animals. One legend says that the Buddha invited all the animals of the kingdom before him, and only 12 turned up. In gratitude, he named a year after each of the animals and those born during that year would inherit some of the personality of that animal. The first animal to arrive was the Rat, followed by Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig.  (In some systems, the Ox is called Buffalo or Bull, the Rabbit is called Hare or Cat, the Goat is called Sheep, and the Pig is called Boar.) Another aspect of Chinese Astrology is the five elements, which modify the traits of an animal sign: Metal, Wood, Fire, Water, and Earth.<br /><br />2006 is the Year of the Dog, and according to author Neil Somerville, Dog years herald an emphasis on defense. As a result, many countries will tighten their borders and increase their security systems in 2006. Somerville also speculates that the United Nations will play a pivotal role in stabilizing troubled areas and restoring order, especially since the Dog year is a strict defender of both land and property. 2006 will also see an increase in group rallies and protests, environmental activism, and humanitarian outreaches for alleviating and preventing suffering. Materialistic culture will lessen as individuals re-evaluate their values and lifestyles, and the steady focus of the Dog will reward those who are willing to put forth some effort in their endeavors.<br /><br />Your Chinese Horoscope 2006 features an overview of each primary animal personality and the five sub-personalities based on the elements, as well as their prospects for 2006. For example, the author gives an overview of the Rat, and then describes the five different types of Rat: Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earth. An astrological forecast for both the primary animal and its sub-personalities are also given.  He also provides a tip for the year and a list of famous people for each animal. Famous horses would include Harris Ford, Bob Geldof, Janet Jackson, Calvin Klein and Condoleezza Rice, while famous Roosters include Benjamin Franklin, Renee Zellweger, Priscilla Presley, Eric Clapton, and Britney Spears.<br /><br />In the Appendix, advice is dispensed for each of the animals including general prospects, career prospects, finance, and relationships. There is also a chart for the relationships between the signs. The most interesting aspect of this 367-page book is the section on Ascendants. Although familiar with the Rising Sign (Ascendant) in traditional astrology, I didn't realize Chinese Astrology contained this element, as well. Somerville provides a chart based on your time of birth, and then explains how the Ascendant will modify your animal sign. For example, I'm a Metal Dog who should fare very well in a Dog year, and my Ascendant is that of the Monkey. This means that the Monkey Ascendant imparts humor and fun to the often serious and determined Dog personality-as well as making it more enterprising and outgoing.<br /><br />I found Your Chinese Horoscope 2006 to be engrossing, informative, and entertaining.

US	49524801	R18N61M6RBTCKB	1564147967	274904902	Chinese Astrology: Exploring the Eastern Zodiac	Books	5	45	48	N	N	Excellent Book On The Chinese Zodiac	\\"Each animal designation is a symbolic archetype and represents specific behavioral psychology. It could perhaps be called the Myers-Briggs personality inventory of Eastern philosophy. Each personality style fulfills an essential place in the balance of the universe.\\" -Shelly Wu<br /><br />In Eastern philosophy, spirit is known as Qi or chi, which is life force energy. The yin/yang symbol is the visual representation of Qi, which is the blending of heaven and Earth, male and female, fire and water, aggression and passivity, giving and receiving. One Yang and one Yin are called \\"Tao\\", which means \\"the way\\". Taoism is an ancient philosophy created by Lao Tse that teaches awareness of natural cosmic cycles and the blending of Yin and Yang, which results in balanced, harmonious living.<br /><br />Applied to Chinese Astrology, Qi is the marriage of divine spirit with human personality. Each of the 12 animal archetypes is a mixture of positive and negative attributes. Positive traits such as loyalty, forgiveness, perseverance, and compassion reflect the alignment of personality with spirit (Qi). Negative traits such as bitterness, anger, jealousy, and possessiveness reflect a great separation between human personality and spiritual essence. In fact, author Shelly Wu says: \\"The greater the gulf between spirit and personality, the darker one's character.\\"<br /><br />Chinese Astrology - Exploring the Eastern Zodiac provides a comprehensive overview of the 12 archetypal temperaments embodied in the animal signs, and what they tell you about yourself and others. At the beginning of the book, Wu provides several pages of charts, so you can find your animal sign and element in a matter of seconds.<br /><br />Each animal is profiled in a unique chart, highlighting lucky color, fragrance, flavor, flower, gem, Feng Shui direction, lucky number, symbolism, and more. Wu then goes on to explain each sign's essential temperament, duality (negative traits), gifts, and capabilities-as well as a \\"who's who\\" of the famous (and infamous!). She also explains how each sign manifests during childhood, as well as in home, hearth, and career. A separate profile of the male and female expression of the archetype is included.<br /><br />Another crucial aspect to Chinese Astrology is the five elements. According to the book, each of the animal signs are considered an \\"Earthly Branch\\", and repeat every 12 years in the Chinese Zodiac. However, the \\"Heavenly Stems\\", or the five elements, occur once every 60 years. The five elements, which bring balance, are Wood (growth), Fire (leadership), Earth (stability), Metal (structure, and Water (feelings). Wu states that everything in the universe, including humans, has a relationship with these five elements and explains the fascinating doctrine of the Five Elements:<br /><br />Wood produces Fire.<br />Fire created Earth.<br />Earth supports Metal.<br />Metal compliments Water.<br />Water assists Wood.<br /><br />Fire destroys Metal.<br />Metal is hostile to Wood.<br />Wood fights Earth.<br />Earth conflicts with Water.<br />Water extinguishes Fire.<br /><br />The first principle reflects how the five elements produce, enable, support and assist one another, while the second principle explains how they destroy, control, destabilize and fight one another.<br /><br />Wu gives a fascinating explanation of the developmental stages of the five elements, how they manifest in personality, and how these elements mesh with the 12 animal signs. For example, a Wood Tiger is not as impetuous as other Tigers, tending to look before they leap. A Wood Rooster, on the other hand, is more thoughtful and tactful than other Rooster-element combinations.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of this engaging 256 book is the Birth Time Companion. This \\"other you\\" is represents the hour that you were born, and further shades your animal sign. This \\"companion\\", akin to the Ascendant of Western Astrology, reveals hidden spiritual possibilities,represents your shadow self, and advises you throughout life. For example, I'm a Metal Dog and my Birth Time Companion is the Monkey. The Monkey, according to Wu, is the consummate salesman gifted with the powers of persuasion, wit, enthusiasm, and eternal youthfulness. Irrepressible, Monkeys usually have a card up their sleeve, impart a delicious sense of humor to each sign, and provides an aptitude for entrepreneurial enterprises. Added to the in-depth information of the animal signs and elements, the Birth Time Companion rounds out a detailed holographic picture of the 12 archetypal patterns found among humans.<br /><br />In the context of relationships, Wu discusses compatibility and attraction. For example, why do instant attractions exist? What is behind the urge to be close to one person and not another? She explains this chemistry (or lack thereof) with a model of four Triangles of Compatibility, known as Trines.  Both love signs and karmic connections are addressed, with an analysis of each pairing. Wu doesn't skimp on the relationship profiles. For example, she highlights each love sign individually and how they pair with other signs.

The Monkey, according to Wu, is the consummate salesman gifted with the powers of persuasion, wit, enthusiasm, and eternal youthfulness. Irrepressible, Monkeys usually have a card up their sleeve, impart a delicious sense of humor to each sign, and provides an aptitude for entrepreneurial enterprises. Added to the in-depth information of the animal signs and elements, the Birth Time Companion rounds out a detailed holographic picture of the 12 archetypal patterns found among humans.     In the context of relationships, Wu discusses compatibility and attraction. For example, why do instant attractions exist? What is behind the urge to be close to one person and not another? She explains this chemistry (or lack thereof) with a model of four Triangles of Compatibility, known as Trines.  Both love signs and karmic connections are addressed, with an analysis of each pairing. Wu doesn't skimp on the relationship profiles. For example, she highlights each love sign individually and how they pair with other signs.

The witch doesn't think so. She, or he as the case may be, wants to know.\\" -from the book<br /><br />From shamanic shape shifting to food and drink, botanicals to sacred days, The Element Encyclopedia of Witchcraft - The Complete A to Z of the Entire Magical World is a fascinating and comprehensive celebration of all facets of witchcraft. From modern Wicca to Egyptian sorcery, Toltec shamanism to African Voudon, author Judith Illes explores the history, folklore, spirituality, and practices of witchcraft and the occult. According to Judika Illes, there are many definitions and beliefs about what a witch, and witchcraft, embodies. In the introduction, she examines the many theories, definitions and attitudes that have accompanied this oft-misunderstood subject.<br /><br />This book celebrates the fun, freedom, mystery and defiance of witchcraft, rather than any specific spiritual or political definition. Thus, this hardcover authoritative reference, which spans 887 pages, covers the people, places, professions, deities, traditions, books, film, fairy tales, animals, herbs, holy days, mythology, tools and symbols spanning hundreds of occult traditions. Topics are arranged alphabetically, and the main chapters are:<br /><br />Elements of Witchcraft<br />Books of Magic and Witchcraft<br />Botanicals<br />Calendar of Revelry and Sacred Days<br />Creative Arts<br />Dictionary of Witchcraft: A Magical Vocabulary<br />The Divine Witch: Goddesses and Gods<br />Ergot, The Corn Mother, and The Rye Wolf<br />Fairies<br />Fairy-Tale Witches and Mother Goose<br />Food and Drink<br />The Hag<br />The Horned One and The Devil<br />Magical Arts<br />Magical Professions<br />Places: A Witch's Travel Guide<br />Tools of Witchcraft<br />Witchcraft Hall of Fame<br />Witchcraze! Persecution of Witches<br />Women's Mysteries<br />Wormwood and Garlic: Dangers and Protections<br /><br />The Element Encyclopedia contains intriguing information like:<br /><br />* The difference between almanacs, books of shadows, and grimoires<br />* The colorful origins and uses of absinthe<br />* In the book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum, Dorothy's slippers were silver, not ruby. She is identified as a sorceress because she wears white and, according to the book, \\"Only witches and sorceresses wear white.\\"<br />* Prospero, the magician in Shakespeare's The Tempest, is believed to at least partially to be based on Dr. John Dee. Dr. Dee was famed astrologer to Queen Elizabeth, as well as a renowned alchemist, magician and scholar. This brilliant occultist was one of the founders of Enochian Magic.<br />* If a plant contains the word \\"bane\\", beware! The word bane is a derivative of the Old German word bano meaning death. Thus, any plant containing \\"bane\\"-such as wolfsbane or henbane-is poisonous.<br />* The character of Sabrina the Teenage Witch didn't begin with Melissa Joan Hart. She first appeared in the back pages of an Archie Comics magazine in October 1962. She was featured in her own comic book in April of 1971.<br />* Psychopomp is a Greek word for a spirit who serves as an escort between the realms of the living and the dead. Hermes and Hecate are two well-known psychopomps.<br />* Corn Mother myths span many cultures, and include Demeter, Baba Yaga, Ezili Dantor, and Saramama.<br />* Cailleach (pronounced \\"coy-luk\\") is a Gaelic word often translated as hag. In Scottish and Irish folklore, Cailleach is a term for spirits corresponding to the archetype of the sacred hag.<br /><br />The Element Encyclopedia of Witchcraft is an utterly fascinating read.  Not only is it a source of browsing entertainment (I open it every chance I get!), but also is a rich source for research and study.

Manipulation is separation, and separation is painful. Another person can love you totally in that moment, and you'd have no way of realizing it. If you act from fear, there's no way you can receive love, because you're trapped in a thought about what you have to do for love. Every stressful thought separates you from people.\\" - Byron Katie<br /><br />Now, more than ever, the \\"disease to please\\" runs rampant through every social, economic, and spiritual stratum. Whether seeking to please or appease a boss, parent, teacher, preacher, partner, child, friend, or god, many are on an all-consuming quest for love, appreciation, and approval. Even self-help books add to the striving, encouraging and teaching manipulative skills for attracting, impressing, and seducing others by pretending to be something we aren't.<br /><br />To put it bluntly, these approaches do not work. Having failed to find love or appreciation from others, millions become the \\"walking wounded\\"-blaming themselves and concluding they are unworthy of love. Some authors or gurus go a step further, admonishing individuals to \\"love yourself\\" while never addressing the painful root that no amount of bubble baths, candles, or pampering can quell: uninvestigated thoughts.<br /><br />Byron Katie's revolutionary process of inquiry has transformed thousands of lives across the globe. Featured in her first book Loving What Is - Four Questions That Can Change Your Life, \\"The Work\\" involves challenging the uninvestigated thoughts that rule our lives. These chaotic stories-which often begin with a \\"should\\"-are the source of havoc, discord, and suffering. When met with four simple questions, stressful thoughts and assumptions disappear, allowing individuals to see a situation-and the people in their lives-in an entirely different light.<br /><br />In I Need Your Love - Is That True? Katie applies The Work to relationships and the pursuit of love, admiration and respect. Showing how to take charge of our own happiness, she provides a step-by-step process for inquiring into some of the most painful, foundational beliefs that entire lives are built upon. When exposing these thoughts to the bright light of inquiry, clarity, peace and authentic love emerges. We then realize that we already are everything we've been looking for. As Katie says:<br /><br />\\"...once you question your thoughts, you discover that you don't have to do anything for love. It was all an innocent misunderstanding. When you want to impress people and win their approval, you're like a child who says, `Look at me! Look at me!' It all comes down to a needy child. When you can love that child and embrace it yourself, the seeking is over.\\"<br /><br />In the chapter titled The Relationship Workshop, Katie shares actual dialogues of inquiry where she asked the questions and people participating in her workshops and schools answered them. Here are a few of the assumptions they investigated together:<br /><br />* My Husband Doesn't Care About Fixing Our Relationship<br />* I'm Unlovable<br />* My Parents Should Love and Appreciate Me<br />* My Spiritual Teacher Let Me Down<br />* I Want Tons of Approval<br />* My Father Treated Me Badly<br />* I'll Lose My Girlfriend if I Tell the Truth<br />* I Need Him to Understand Me<br />* My Love Should Give Me Sex<br /><br />With penetrating wisdom, Katie shows us how to come to our own rescue and disentangle love from need. By embracing what is, we refuse to argue with reality. Ironically, we then realize that what we were pursuing was really there all along.<br /><br />The Work has literally changed my life. One example has been with my son, who was diagnosed with PDD-NOS when he was 3 years old. On the autistic spectrum, my son's behavior-as well as my fretting about his future-brought me much grief and physical distress (including IBS).  Afterinvestigating the expectations and edicts of \\"experts\\" and family, clear wisdom bubbled to the surface from inside. Peace replaced worry and confidence replaced paralysis. I am now able to meet my son with joy and acceptance, loving his uniqueness and beauty. His behavior has changed dramatically, and his amazing progress has been quantified by psychologists. (Not that it matters!) I am convinced that loving what is has provided an atmosphere where he can blossom and thrive-and so can my husband and myself.<br /><br />Every time I experience a stressful thought that induces anxiety or suffering, I am armed with four simple questions that can literally turn a situation around on a dime.<br /><br />The more you investigate your thoughts, the easier it gets. You begin to see things for what they really are-reclaiming an innocent, lovable self and the glorious life that you were meant to live. What I said of Katie's first book also holds true for I Need Your Love - Is That True?: it replaces all the self-help books on your shelf because inquiry is the key to emotional freedom and genuine, effortless love.<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of [[ASIN:1571745874 The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present]] (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)ce from inside.

There are four sections which give a short synopsis of a part of the story, with small captions under shadowed outlines. Looking through the pages of stickers, the child can select the matching one and place it on the silhouette. The four sections are:<br /><br />SHOWTIME!<br /><br />The animals in New York's zoo have everything they need. Alex the lion dines on sizzling steaks and basks in the glory of being the zoo's star attraction. Gloria the hioppo soaks all day in her luxurious bath. Melman the hypochondriac giraffe is attended by a team of specialist doctors. But when the penguins put the ideas of going to \\"the wild\\" into Marty the zebra's head, everything changes for them all.<br /><br />SHIP AHOY!<br /><br />Once Marty has made his break for the wild, there's no turning back. The others catch up with him at the train station but the police capture them and ship them off to Africa. From inside their boxes on the boat, the animals wonder what lies ahead.<br /><br />PARADISE<br /><br />The long sea journey ends at the island of Madagascar. On first sight, it's a wild animal's paradise! The only problem is that thse animals aren't wild. Alex, the so-called \\"King of the Jungle\\", freaks out when a spider lands on him. However, the island's predators, the foosas, are terrified of this enormous lion. (NOTE: the book mis-spells foosas--the hyena-like creatures--calling them \\"fossas\\".)<br /><br />GOODBYE!<br /><br />The zoo animals are having a great adventure in beautiful Madagascar. Then, unexpectedly, the penguins reappear with the boat. Now that they have had a taste for adventure, where will the animals go next?<br /><br />In addition to these fours sections which feature the silhouettes, there is also two blank pages to put stickers on wherever you like: a page of the beach, and one of the ship's deck.<br /><br />If you're careful, the stickers are actually re-usable. My son filled all the pages, and *still* has 15 stickers left over! Any leftover stickers can be used for book covers, journals, scrapbooking, invitations, letters--wherever a child would like to use stickers.<br /><br />The slick, colorful pages will be sure to delight children, especially as they try to find the stickers that match the silhouettes. My son still enjoys flipping through the book, even though he's matched all the stickers and used most of the rest for the beach and ship scenes.ul, the stickers are actually re-usable.

Our actions are guided by instinct and emotions-that is, we listen to the silent `voice of integrity'. Once we learn to speak, the people around us hook our attention and program us with knowledge. The `voice of knowledge' comes alive inside our head, and it never stops talking, judging, gossiping, and abusing us. It constantly sabotages our happiness and keeps us from enjoying a reality of truth and love.\\" -Don Miguel Ruiz<br /><br />The Voice of Knowledge Cards is a 50 card deck that shows us how to recover the silent voice of integrity and find inner peace by challenging the lies that we've swallowed along life's journey. The glossy cards measure 4.7 x 4.4 x 1.2 inches, and features colorful, whimsical artwork by Lori Koefoed. One side of the card offers a statement, while the others side elaborates on the idea. Some examples include:<br /><br />The mind is fertile ground for concepts, ideas, and opinions.<br /><br />\\"If we believe a lie, that lie takes root in our mind and can grow big and strong, like a tree. One little lie can be very contagious, spreading its seeds from person to person when we share it with others.\\"<br /><br />Emotional pain is a symptom of being abused.<br /><br />\\"Every time we lie to ourselves, judge ourselves, or reject ourselves, our emotional reaction isn't pleasant. The pain is letting us know that we have to do something to stop the abuse.\\"<br /><br />We are born in truth, but we grow up believing in lies.<br /><br />\\"One of the biggest lies in the story of humanity is the lie of our imperfection. When we believe this lie, we use the lie to judge ourselves, to punish ourselves, and to justify our mistakes.\\"<br /><br />Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love.<br /><br />\\"If other people try to write your story, it means they don't respect you. They consider that you're not a good artist who can write your own story, even though you were born to write your own story.\\"<br /><br />The artwork on the Voice of Knowledge Cards is truly gorgeous. Most of the messages are very wise and penetrating, although a few can prove confusing to some. One of the reasons I wasn't big on the book that these cards are based upon is because it seemed like a departure from Ruiz's other works-especially The Four Agreements. There's a lot of talk about lies and those who tell them, but what is truth? What is a lie? Ruiz talks a lot about personal stories, as does many Toltec, self-help, and New Age authors.<br /><br />With some of the messages on the cards, I couldn't help but hear Byron Katie saying \\"Is this true? Can you know for sure it's true?\\" Katie asks us \\"who would you be without your story?\\", and gives us 4 questions called inquiry that can dismantle every painful thought that causes suffering and separation. (If you want to be free you MUST get her books Loving What Is and I Need Your Love - Is that True?) But Ruiz, while acknowledging our beautiful storytelling and perfection, still paints with the brushstrokes of duality. We're perfect as is, but not if we're lying to ourselves. We're amazing artists and storytellers, but we are swallowing lies.<br /><br />If you're an ardent fan of Don Miguel Ruiz, as well as his book The Voice of Knowledge, you'll enjoy this deck.

This review refers to ISBN#1401903479 which is a 50 card deck based on the book of the same name.)<br /><br />\\"Today I will trust that the events occurring in my life are not random. My experiences aren't mistakes, and the Universe, my Higher Power, and life are not picking on me. I'm going through exactly what I need to go through to learn something valuable-something that will prepare me for the joy and love that I'm seeking.\\" -from the Trusting in Life card<br /><br />Melody Beattie, the bestselling author of The Language of Letting Go, has created a 50 card deck reminding us that we can ask for and accept the healing energy of God and the Universe each and every day. Based on her bestselling book, this beautifully illustrated deck inspires both self empowerment and present moment awareness. By truly living in the present moment, we can allow life to happen instead of trying to force outcomes. Relinquishing regrets over the past and fears about the future, we can make the most of every day. The Language of Letting Go Cards gently prods us to take a closer look at the limiting beliefs we've adopted, providing an empowering affirmation on each card.<br /><br />A few of examples from the deck:<br /><br />Accepting Change<br /><br />\\"Today I will be open to the process of change. I will trust my Higher Power and believe that the place where I'll be dropped off is better than the place where I was picked up. I know that change is necessary to take me wherever I need to go.\\"<br /><br />Approving of Myself<br /><br />\\"I will let go of my need for approval and my need to be liked. Instead, I will choose to like and approve of myself. The people who count (including me) will respect me when I'm true to who I really am.\\"<br /><br />Maintaining Boundaries<br /><br />\\"Today I will gain a new awareness of those areas where I need healthier boundaries. I will release my naïve assumption that the other person is always right. I will exchange that view for trusting and listening to myself, and setting and maintaining healthy boundaries.\\"<br /><br />Rescuing Myself<br /><br />\\"Today I will not wait for someone to come to my aid. I'm not helpless. Although help may come, I'm my own rescuer. My relationships will dramatically improve when I stop rescuing others and stop expecting others to rescue me.\\"<br /><br />The Language of Letting Go Cards are 5.7 x 3.9 x 1.3 inches on thick, sturdy card stock. The vibrant glossy images feature the unique artwork of Elizabeth Rosen, and capture the thematic essence of each message.

True change is an `inside' job. If we don't learn how to mold our mind and body into healthier ways of feeling and thinking, then our outer experiences will get stuck in a rut.\\" -Mona Lisa Schulz<br /><br />Neuropsychiatrist Mona Lisa Schulz, M.D., Ph.D. has created the Mind/Body Makeover Oracle Cards to help you rewire the emotional patterns that increase your chances of succumbing to physical illness, depression, and anxiety. This 70-card deck features oval cards which contains three different sections:<br /><br />1.The emotion or feeling that needs healing<br />2.The Healthy Thought pattern (regular text, upright position)<br />3.The Unhealthy Thought pattern that can precipitate depression, anxiety, anger, and painful life events (reversed text in italics)<br /><br />The Mind/Body Makeover deck is constructed to be an oracle, and includes ten different suits. The five Feeling Suits are made up of Sadness, Anger, Fear, Love and Joy and the five Action/Health Reaction Suits are made up of Self-Esteem, Goals, Relationships, Society, and Healthy Body. There are seven numbered cards in each suit that represent arenas in which we can experience a feeling, a mood, and its consequence:<br /><br />*Families and Organizations<br />*Relationships, money, and creativity<br />*Responsibility, work, and competition<br />*Partnership and nurturance<br />*Communication, will, and timing<br />*Perception, morality, life purpose, and spirituality<br /><br />The 99 page companion booklet advises shuffling the deck, allowing for reversals, and then quickly pulling out a card and laying it face-up on the table. If the reversed statement is on top, it indicates that an unhealthy pattern is predominant. Reverse the deck so the healthy statement is visible, and then repeat it to yourself as an affirmation. Schulz encourages you to write the healthy statement ten times a day, while repeating it aloud.<br /><br />For example, the upright healthy pattern on Healing Anger 6 says:<br /><br />\\"I love myself unconditionally; I accept both my strengths and my flaws. Even though I love myself just as I am, I accept the parts of myself that need to change and grow.\\"<br /><br />The reverse says:<br /><br />\\"I frequently find fault in myself. I'm not trying hard enough.\\"<br /><br />The companion booklet elaborates on each card, containing practical information and advice based on brain chemistry, psychology, and metaphysical principles.<br /><br />Another example is Healthy Relationships 2:<br /><br />\\"True love and partnership always encourage unlimited expression of creative and spiritual growth.\\"<br /><br />The reverse, reflecting the unhealthy patterns, says:<br /><br />\\"If I try my best and succeed, I may lose the love of people close to me.\\"<br /><br />The oval cards of the Mind/Body Makeover Oracle are made of sturdy, thick card stock with a glossy veneer. The side with the statements is rather bland, with subdued colors like russet, cornflower blue, pale yellow, sage green, salmon, and camel; a decorative border surrounds the reversible statements. The image on the back is not reversible, and shows a picture of the Mona Lisa with an anatomically correct brain in her lap.<br /><br />Because of the card thickness and shape, this deck is very hard to shuffle. I have a version of the deck that doesn't include the word \\"oracle\\" in the title, even though the companion book indicates that it is meant to be used as such. In my opinion, it was a mistake to try to make the Mind/Body Makeover Cards an oracle deck. Dividing it up into 10 \\"suits\\" and 7 numbers makes the deck confusing and unwieldy-especially if you're used to thinking along the lines of Tarot suits. The information and wisdom included in the cards and companion booklet is very solid, practical, and helpful-great for a meditation deck. In fact, just about anyone could benefit from using this deck for meditation and self-inquiry. But by making this deck an oracle, the messages get lost in the distracting presentation of reversals and suit titles.<br /><br />While the image of the Mona Lisa is fitting considering the author's name, it is an overused one. The brain in her lap certainly isn't attractive, and feels gimmicky. I was also put-off by oft-mentioned term \\"medical intuitive\\". Ever since Caroline Myss brought the word into healing circles, psychiatrist like Judith Orloff, Mona Lisa Schulz and others are jumping on the \\"me too!\\" bandwagon. They are not just intuitives; they are \\"smart psychics\\" because of their education (so Schulz says in the back of the booklet)-and feel a need to separate their \\"medical intuitive\\" practice from their \\"normal\\" psychiatry practice.<br /><br />The Mind/Body Makeover Oracle Cards contains vital medical, biological, psychological, and intuitive information for breaking unhealthy patterns like sadness, fear, and anger by replacing them with empowering beliefs. Yet, I feel the presentation obscures the wonderful wisdom contained in this deck and companion booklet. If you're looking for an attractive, easy-to-use oracle deck, you may be disappointed. However, if you're looking to examine the beliefs and attitudes that keep you disempowered and defeated, the wisdom of psychiatrist Mona Lisa Schulz may hold an important key to your personal freedom.<br /><br />(To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews section at [...])age of the Mona Lisa is fitting considering the author's name, it is an overused one.

The Mind/Body Makeover Oracle Cards contains vital medical, biological, psychological, and intuitive information for breaking unhealthy patterns like sadness, fear, and anger by replacing them with empowering beliefs. Yet, I feel the presentation obscures the wonderful wisdom contained in this deck and companion booklet. If you're looking for an attractive, easy-to-use oracle deck, you may be disappointed. However, if you're looking to examine the beliefs and attitudes that keep you disempowered and defeated, the wisdom of psychiatrist Mona Lisa Schulz may hold an important key to your personal freedom.

With a talent for profiling, DuBois uses her gifts to tap into the criminal mind, assessing both motive and method. She can also identify the locations of crimes and missing bodies. Struggling to live a \\"normal\\" life as a wife and mother, she also communicates with the dead, relaying vital information to individuals that result in some measure of comfort and closure.<br /><br />Allison was 6 years old when she first discovered her abilities, though she chose to downplay her talents for many years. While in her senior year in college, she interned at the DA's office. It was then that she realized she could use her gift in an almost miraculous way: as she handled evidence from homicide investigations, she began to see the crimes as they had occurred. She then decided to use her abilities to help solve crimes and ease the pain of people who have lost loved ones.<br /><br />Writing in a conversational style, DuBois shares stories of her encounters with those who've passed on, as well as personal experiences with friends and loved ones in need of closure. She also chronicles the difficulties of mediumship, and offers helpful advice to youngsters-\\"kindergarten mediums\\" - who have \\"the gift\\". Also a research medium, she helps scientists better understand mediums and psychic phenomena.<br /><br />Avid fans of the TV show Medium will love getting a glimpse into the personality and experiences of Allison DuBois. Even Joe-Allison's aerospace engineer husband-has a guest appearance in his chapter \\"Loving a Medium\\". Those seeking comfort that there is life beyond life will find a measure of comfort in Allison's approach and her stories.<br /><br />Don't Kiss Them Good-Bye is a very easy read, but there are glaring grammatical and typological mistakes throughout the book. How this manuscript got passed the Editors at Fireside Books is beyond me. It happened so often it was distracting! Also, Allison's style is a bit rambling, making it difficult to follow the characters in her stories and track what has happened to whom.<br /><br />I really enjoy the show Medium, but I felt that I gleaned more information about Allison and her experiences from the show than I did from her book.<br /><br />If you're looking for in-depth information on mediumship, this isn't the book for you. This book is \\"psychic lite\\", and those familiar with New Age and metaphysical books would be greatly disappointed in my opinion. But for those people new to the concept of connecting with the Other Side-as well as fans of the TV show Medium-Don't Kiss Them Good-Bye will be sure to delight and inspire.Books is beyond me.

No one can take them away from us! And that's one more reason why it's wise for lightworkers to become familiar with the various divinities, and to be aware of the special gifts they offer. In the future, these Divinities will prove to be valuable allies (just as they are in the present).\\" - Doreen Virtue<br /><br />Who is Saint-Germain? What about Vywamus? Can goddesses, gods, archangels, and ascended masters really connect on a personal level? For what purposes can I invoke a deity?<br /><br />Angel therapist Doreen Virtue answers these questions and many more in Archangels and Ascended Masters - A Guide to Working and Healing with Divinities and Deities. After researching 77 divinities, personally verifying their accessibility and integrity, Virtue has compiled her findings and experiences in a lively encyclopedic format.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with ascended masters, Virtue explains that these ones are great prophets, healers or teachers that once walked upon the earth and are now in the spirit world helping humanity from beyond. Ascended masters include Jesus, Buddha, Yogananda, Mother Mary, and Saint Padre Pio. Virtue asserts that she isn't promoting polytheism or the worship of divinities. Rather, archangels, deities, and ascended masters represent the various faces that one God presents to us, and we work in partnership with these aspects of God for insight and healing.<br /><br />In Part 1 of Archangels and Ascended Masters, Virtue lists the originating culture, country, and/or spiritual system, as well as their alternative names. She then gives a brief historical summary of each archangel or deity, a channeled message or impression, what each helps with, and an invocation. Many of the channeled messages were conducted at power points throughout the world including Stonehenge in England and the Kona coast of Hawaii.<br /><br />Part 2 of the book features invocations for specific needs and issues, such as abundance, addictions and cravings, courage, find your life's purpose, healing a pet, weight loss, and global peace. Part 3 provides a list of whom to call upon for specific needs. For example, if you were in need of help regarding parenting, you can consult with Dana, Hathor, Ishtar, or Mother Mary. For insight into working with crystals, Merlin, Melchizedek, or Saint-Germain would provide valuable insight. Isolt helps with healing from divorce, while Pele helps with clear communication and prioritizing. Archangel Haniel aids in poise, Saint Therese protects pilots and airline crew, and Maeve works wonders with aromatherapy.<br /><br />This 243 book wasn't intended to be an exhaustive treatment of archangels, ascended masters, gods, and goddesses. Rather, it's an introduction to spiritual facilitators spanning Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Asian, Celtic, Theosophical, Cabalistic, New Age, Christian, Jewish, Catholic, Tibetan, Babylonian, and Buddhist roots. Archangels and Ascended Masters can be used to acquaint yourself with new spirit helpers, or for deepening your experience with those familiar to you. You can even use this book as an oracle by saying a prayer or voicing your concern, then opening the book to see which spiritual helper has some insight for you.<br /><br />My favorite way to use this book is in conjunction with Virtue's Goddess Guidance Oracle Cards. Every time I choose a card from the Goddess Guidance deck, I am amazed at the pointed and accurate the wisdom conveyed by a particular goddess. I then put the card on a small altar I have on a bookshelf in my bedroom, and \\"work\\" with that particular goddess until I feel to join with another. For further information about a goddess, I then turn to Archangels and Ascended Masters for clarification and additional insight.<br /><br />If you're curious about the spirit realm and the help available to you, this book will provide a solid starting point for your journey. Archangelsand Ascended Masters is an engaging read, and Virtue's personal warmth and appreciation for the various deities shines through. Providing comfort, imparting insight, and granting joy are among the many gifts waiting for humanity from these special unseen others.r journey.

Its denizens are ready to take you by the hand and lead you into the Fairy Ring...\\"<br /><br />Pixies, brownies, mermaids, leprechauns, and unicorns...not so long ago, belief in the fairy world crossed every strata of society. People believed that fairies could see into the future and were capable of bestowing the gift of prophecy on favored mortals. At present, more and more people are re-discovering the enchanted world of the fairies, seeking to connect and consult with the Wee Folk.<br /><br />The Fairy Ring oracle is a 60 card divination deck that allows you to tap into the wisdom of the fairies for insight and direction. Featuring the surreal art of Paul Mason, the card images combine photography, computer imaging and illustration, serving as a visual portal to the mystical Otherworld. At 248 pages, the companion Guide to the Fairy Ring-written by Anna Franklin-weaves a rich tapestry of history and folklore. While fairy legends exist all over the world, The Fairy Ring features fairies from Britain and Ireland.<br /><br />Franklin has collected fairy legends for years, recording over 3,000 Little People. While acknowledging that she's uncovered the mere tip of the iceberg, she reveals the magical profile of 52 different fairies. Since fairies are often seasonal creatures, the Fairy Ring deck is divided into four suits corresponding to the four elements-with related flora and fauna featured in the card borders:<br /><br />Spring Suit (Air) - bright green ferns<br /><br />Summer Suit (Fire) - colorful wildflowers<br /><br />Autumn Suit (Water) - autumn leaves<br /><br />Winter Suit (Earth) - glossy holly leaves, red berries, pine branches and cones<br /><br />The thirteen cards in each suit are numbered ace to nine, with four court cards: Lady, Knave, Queen, and King. In addition to the four suits, there are eight festival cards marking the chief fairy feasts of Imbolc, Ostara, Beltane, Midsummer, Lughnasa, Herfest, Samhain, and Yule. The card backing is fully reversible, with two interlocking golden rings of Celtic design centered on a green marbled background.<br /><br />Franklin recounts the lively history and myth of each fairy depicted, as well as the divinatory and reversed meaning of each card. Instructions on working with the Wee Folk-if advisable-are also provided in the Fairy Ring Guide. While many fairy oracles portray only helpful sprites and beautiful winged creatures, the Fairy Ring includes misshapen ogres and mischievous tricksters such as the Blue Hag, Changeling, Boggart, Jenny Greenteeth, Banshee, and Will o' the Wisp. Those looking for a \\"feel good\\" deck may find some of the creepy images off-putting.<br /><br />The Fairy Ring Guide also includes nine spreads, four of which are printed on cards: The Fairy Ring, The Fairy Mound, The Fairy Oak, and the Fairy Market. The layouts are for anywhere from five to twelve cards, providing a comprehensive snapshot of both temporary and pervasive energies. I performed a personal reading with this deck, using the eight-card Fairy Ring spread. While a consistent (repetitive?) theme arose from the cards, I didn't feel like they spoke clearly or directly. This could be due to my lack of familiarity with the deck, but more likely because I lack resonance with the fairy world.<br /><br />Those interested in elementals and the Wee Folk-and aren't disconcerted by some of the darker expressions of the fae-will be delighted with the Fairy Ring. It's an imaginative deck with pagan overtones, and the companion Guide offers great information on Irish and British fairy folklore.<br /><br />(To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews section at [...])is fully reversible, with two interlocking golden rings of Celtic design centered on a green marbled background.

Used well, Tarot can illustrate both and help us to exercise more freedom of choice in our lives.\\" -from the book<br /><br />Tarot for Life is a jargon-free, no-nonsense book that not only explains the meaning of the cards but also unravels the spirit behind them. Instead of providing dogmatic interpretations, Prospero encourages the reader to create a unique relationship with the Tarot. In fact, he stresses the importance of following your instincts, because ultimately, you have the last word on your relationship with the cards.<br /><br />Divided into 22 lessons and featuring Tarot images commissioned especially for the book, Tarot for Life provides spreads, instructions on contacting your spirit Guide, reading ethics, affirmations, meditations and more. In each lesson you'll find:<br /><br />* Some practical information, either about the structure of the Tarot or how to use it in readings or in other ways<br /><br />* A spread you can use, with some idea of where it can be most useful<br /><br />* Card descriptions-one Major Arcana card in each lesson and four Minor Arcana in lessons I to XIV<br /><br />* An exercise based on the Major Arcana for the lesson<br /><br />Although this book can be used for individual study, Prospero offers that it may be more enjoyable and rewarding to experience this course in a group of six people or less.<br /><br />Prospero shares his knowledge of the Tree of Life (Kabbalah), magick, and Thelema, and offers a great chakra meditation for grounding. When I read Tarot for Life, I felt like I was being taught by a friend sitting across the table; with some Tarot books, the information is presented in a dry, elitist manner-but not so with Tarot for Life. Immediately accessible, the lessons meld esoterica, common sense, and personal experience for a fascinating course on the Tarot.<br /><br />The author writes in such an engaging style that it can be easy to miss the wisdom he offers. For example, regarding the meaning of the Knight of Wands he explains: \\"As a level of development, either a change in attitude from `I should be given' to `I can get' or a change in outer circumstances which removes a block.\\" For the meaning of the Knight of Swords, he remarks: \\"Be aware that the progress may be broadening rather than deepening knowledge.\\"<br /><br />It's tidbits like these that can contribute greatly to a reader's understanding and use of the Tarot.<br /><br />My only criticism of this book is that I wish Prospero would have delved even deeper for the exercise portion of the lessons. In Appendix Two, he explains that he intended to write a pathworking covering all of the Major Arcana and building up an inner landscape that you can return to any time. Yet, he says that if someone is capable of using such an inner space, they should be equally capable of constructing it for themselves.<br /><br />In my opinion, this does a great disservice for those unfamiliar with pathworking; I would have loved to read a comprehensive treatment of pathworking with the Majors. Instead, we're given a general outline on how to do it, within the constructs of the Tree of Life. No diagram of the Tree is given, so he merely describes the spheres and how they can be used as \\"houses\\" for the inner kingdom. Of course, those with no knowledge of Kabbalah or the Tree of Life would be quite confused by this.<br /><br />This criticism on my part is quite minor given the aim and accomplishment of Tarot for Life. It just so happens that Prospero is such an engaging writer, I couldn't help but want more. In this case, my criticism is actually a complement.h an engaging style that it can be easy to miss the wisdom he offers.

This unique system combines the holistic and creative traditions of Whole Systems Design with the most potent aspects of Vastu Shastra. Vastu, an ancient science from India, was the original teaching on which Feng Shui is based.\\" -from the book<br /><br />Renowned experts Robin and Michael Mastro have demystified the ancient principles of Vastu by creating an accessible model for creating personal altars. Like the compass lineage of Feng Shui, Vastu Shastra is governed by five elements and eight directions-much like a Ba Gua map. However, in the Mastro system, Metal becomes Spirit, which appropriately resides in the center.<br /><br />Altars concentrate chi-or life force-for the promotion of harmony, health, fulfillment and prosperity. Arranging personal items and spiritual tokens with a specific intention generates a powerful energy vortex for manifesting spirit into matter. In Altars of Power and Grace, the Mastros explain the science and history of Vastu Shastra, the attributes of the five elements and representational objects, and the areas and placements for the eight directions.<br /><br />The eight directions represent certain desires and dreams, and altars can be created for each aspiration:<br /><br />North: Abundance and Prosperity<br /><br />Northeast: Spirituality<br /><br />East: Health and Well-Being<br /><br />Southeast: Life Changes and Transformation<br /><br />South: Career and Recognition<br /><br />Southwest: Helpful People and Universal Support<br /><br />West: Creativity and Knowledge<br /><br />Northwest: Relationships and Marriage<br /><br />Altars of Power and Grace provides clear step by step instructions, colorful photographs and graphics, and a thorough treatment of personal examples and experiences. Also included are helpful charts such as correspondences for each type of altar (including color, gemstone, mantra, and animal), activation ceremonies, yantras, and mantras. The Resource section contains a glossary of terms, and five pages of \\"who's who\\" among gods, goddesses, and religious deities (e.g. Archangel Zadkiel, Minerva, Christ, Ganesh, and Lakshmi), and recommended books and websites. The Mastros also offer instructions on altars for special occasions such as weddings, births, anniversaries, and other rites of passage-as well as a beautiful global peace altar.<br /><br />The great thing about the Vastu Shastra system is that you can use mementos that you already own, or set out to find special icons and symbols that represents your life, personality, and spiritual path. The Mastros also supply readers with a special website address to download free yantras to print out for altar activation, so you can couple your personal tokens with the power of yantras for a specific intention.<br /><br />Altars of Power and Grace-which won the Best Book of 2004 Award from [...]-is a wonderful tool for focusing intention, promoting well-being, achieving desires, and cultivating spiritual connection through the creation and use of personal altars.who\\" among gods, goddesses, and religious deities (e.g. Archangel Zadkiel, Minerva, Christ, Ganesh, and Lakshmi), and recommended books and websites.

What can say hello and goodbye, can be small and silent as well as big loud, and be planted, blown or thrown?<br /><br />In the delightful picture book Something Special, a curious little frog encounters a mysterious gift outside his home near a castle moat. With only the clue \\"it's something special\\", he searches high and low, far and wide, for the answer to a puzzling riddle. Will you guess the surprise before he does?<br /><br />Written by Terri Cholene, Something Special features whimsical illustrations by Doug Keith. I have to say that I enjoyed the artwork in this book more than any other picture book I've read. Hairy bugs carrying suitcases, spotted frogs throwing snowballs, and a turtle bearing a goopy insect cake upon its back are but a few of the delightful images conveying the tale of a magical gift.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book, however, is the artistic rendering of the words. Drawn as flames, icing, branches, stones, and vines-not to mention convex text that appear to be fancifully encased in bubbles-the depiction of the words of the story are utterly enchanting. I found myself marveling at each page; it's not often that the words of a picture book are as charming as the story itself.<br /><br />Geared towards ages 3-8, Something Special would make a wonderful addition to a child's library, for both the beautiful illustrations and the uplifting tale of the magical gift inside.	2005-06-06

All I ever had to do was ask the part of me that knew.\\" -from the book<br /><br />The inspiration for All I See is a Part of Me came to author Chara Curtis while sitting on a log one sunny day. Noticing the support of the log-as well as the river and forest-she envisioned billions of dancing lights of life. She realized that everything she was seeing was of the same essence-and that she was part of a sea of love and light.<br /><br />Artist Cynthia Aldrich conveys the author's message with chalky, playful images awash with color. From Sister Star to her teddy bear, the child in the book begins to realize that she is a part of all she sees-and all she sees is a part of her, as well.<br /><br />All I See is a Part of Me captures the reverie that comes from present-moment awareness, as well as the child-like acceptance that All That Is shares the same source and essence. By finding and feeling the light within, the child then finds the same light in others.<br /><br />Although geared towards children, this lovely book reminds us that all is attainable from within-and that everything we encounter reflects a part of Who We Are. I highly recommend this book for all ages, especially as a reminder of our oneness with the Universe.	2005-06-06

Children are never too young to begin exploring the many different cultures that make up our beautiful world. From the fields of Tanzania to the hills of Switzerland, the jungles of Costa Rica to the tundra or Russia, We Share One World conveys the message that we can all dream one dream as we share this world-a dream that all peoples will live in peace.<br /><br />Depicting various cultures and nationalities-as well as wild animals existing harmoniously-We Share One World is a timely message showing that world peace is possible...and it begins in the heart, one person at a time.<br /><br />An interesting aspect to this book is the endpapers, which feature a unique map inspired by R. Buckminster Fuller which shows the entire surface of the Earth undistorted, revealing our planet as \\"one big island in one big ocean\\".<br /><br />If ever humanity needed to be reminded that we share one world and that boundaries, barriers, and territories are all in the mind-whether physical or ideological-it is now.	2005-06-06

Drawing on the lives of saints, myth, folklore, symbol, druidism, and poetry, McColman provides an engaging overview of the key themes of this ancient spiritual tradition. Weaving his way through 40 different \\"paths\\"-each one consisting of 3, 9, or 21 meditations-the author demonstrates by example how the Celts value humor, storytelling and riddles over dry facts and matter-of-fact descriptions.<br /><br />A few of the 40 \\"paths\\" include:<br /><br />*The Path of the Bard<br /><br />*The Path of the Seer<br /><br />*The Path of Mythology<br /><br />*The Path of the Saints<br /><br />*The Path of the Fairies<br /><br />*The Path of Anamchara<br /><br />*The Path of Hospitality<br /><br />*The Path of the Gods<br /><br />*The Path of the Goddesses<br /><br />*The Path of the Otherworld<br /><br />*The Path of the Warrior<br /><br />*The Path of Meditation<br /><br />*The Path of Sacred Animals<br /><br />*The Path of the Grail<br /><br />*The Path of the Ogham<br /><br />Rather than ascribe a particular date to a meditation, McColman numbers them from 1-366 so you can digest them at your own pace: one every day or many at a single sitting. 366 Celt covers a nice slice of Celtic terrain with reflections on sacred sites, holy days, ancient treasures, stories of fairies and heroes, flora and fauna of Celtic lore, and more. This book also includes a bibliography and index.<br /><br />An example of one of the reflections is Meditation 64 under the Path of Neart:<br /><br />\\"The Celtic tradition has a reputation for being optimistic. Certainly Celtic Christianity is a remarkably positive expression of the Christ path, and Celtic paganism (with its emphasis on the beauty of nature, the nobility of the hero, and the immortality of the soul) has its clear positive orientation as well. I rather think this upbeat characteristic of the Celtic path begins with the reality of neart. If we live in a universe pulsating with power and abundance, then ultimately our problems our solvable, surmountable-there's nothing to fear. It's reminiscent of Jesus' overarching message: Be not afraid.

The start of a new millennium triggered a need to uncover and understand the self, and I turned to the language of the Tarot to uncover my own mysteries. However, the various decks that were available on the market...failed to connect with my inner being. I grew weary of my journey to try to find that one special deck with which I could conduct my own readings, and decided to venture on a sister journey to create one of my own.\\" -Zach Wong<br /><br />Sensuous curvilinear strokes, striking art nouveau-style images, and vibrant luminescent stained-glass surroundings enliven every card in the Revelations Tarot. Layers of symbolism, illuminated color, and intricate shading combine with intriguing reversible images that allow for interpretation no matter which way the card is laid.<br /><br />Although based on the Rider-Waite and its traditional renderings, Zach Wong's sophisticated, reversible artwork and innovative design distinguishes Revelations Tarot from other R-W clones.<br /><br />Before I get into the nuts and bolts of this deck, I want to convey that it's obvious to me that Wong hasn't created a deck \\"just for the heck of it\\" or because he's an able artist who wanted a challenge. Born from intense personal excavation, his use and interpretation of symbol reveals depth of spirit and breadth of mind. In my opinion, this kind of self-reflection is what separates a shallow deck from a great reading deck, especially when the Tarot is used for personal awareness.<br /><br />THE MAJOR ARCANA<br /><br />What sets the Trumps apart from the Minors is the fractured mask that each character wears. Wong explains that the masks are \\"merely a representation of a `human' relation, similar to that of the mythical gods who stand in human form amongst us to ease our comprehension of the messages they deliver.\\" Considering the nature of the Greater Mysteries, this makes complete sense. The gods and goddesses govern the nature of archetypal patterns, so the lessons they teach us are \\"nothing personal\\", after all.<br /><br />THE MINOR ARCANA<br /><br />Although the Minors lack consistent color schemes, other conspicuous hallmarks announce the four suits and their elemental correspondences: the Cups feature merpeople, indicating emotion and freedom of movement; the Wands feature magicians, warriors, and sages as they create or fight with the element of fire; the Pentacles feature metallic humanoids consistent with the earthly, material realm; and Swords feature serious-minded warriors who employ fierce logic.<br /><br />The Aces are especially exquisite, and the Court cards follow Page, Knight, Queen, and King depictions.<br /><br />THE COMPANION BOOK<br /><br />The companion book is written by the artist, and numbers 199 pages. Wong gives upright and reversed meanings for each card, an explanation of the significant images and symbols, and a general overview of the numerological patterns of the Minor Arcana. I found myself highlighting portions as I read through the book. Rather than the warmed-over interpretations offered by many companion books, the author provides fresh observations. Several of Wong's insights allowed me to see various cards from a new perspective. For example, for the reversed Sun he says: \\"In families, children can be hard to contain due to hyperactivity and restlessness.\\" I never saw the reversed Sun this way, but it perfectly describes my sunny-dispositioned son when he's exuberant!<br /><br />For the reversed Queen of Cups, Wong writes: \\"Within her, she could also harbor angst and self-loathing for her inability to do more with herself and her talents.\\" Part of the symbolism of this card: \\"Her eyes are not opened, for her powers extend beyond the mind's eye. She can see all from channeling through her cup.\\"<br /><br />I also enjoyed Wong's take on the elements as represented by the four suits of the Minor Arcana. Four basic spreads areat the back of the book: Past, Present, Future; Four Elements, 7 Days Spread; and the ever-trusty Horoscope Spread.<br /><br />OTHER CONSIDERATIONS<br /><br />The box set comes with a black organdy bag for card storage, as well as a stiff paper box.  The cards themselves are slick, and are the same size (and have the same feel) as those from The Quest Tarot. The card backing is reversible, with blue, indigo and black brushstrokes swirling in an abstract lemniscate. In the center sets a faded boxy cross-like symbol.<br /><br />The reversals provide visual interest, but are not mirror images. For example, the upright Emperor stands upright, arms close to the body. However, the reversed image shows his outstretched arms perpendicular to his body as he hangs by Illuminated \\"strings\\" like a puppet.<br /><br />HOW IT READS<br /><br />Having recently undertaken a new project that would have taken months to finish, I thought I'd test this deck out regarding this venture. I created a 7 card spread tailored to my situation, \\"finger-painted\\" and shuffled the deck numerous times, and began to read. As I saw the cards, my heart sank into my stomach. All of the cards worked in concert to relay a very specific message and it wasn't an easy one to swallow. However, in the depths of my being, I knew heeding this profound message will conserve my energy, preserve my health, and re-direct my efforts where they need to be at this time. I am so confident of the message of these cards that I made an immediate U-turn.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Sophisticated yet accessible, this is one of those innovative decks that elicit comments like \\"Ohhhh....cool!\\" (At least, that was *my* reaction upon seeing the cards!) For beginners who choose to read reversals, Wong's clear visual and interpretative synthesis of the Tarot will make the process much less daunting. The Revelations Tarot is a must-have for deck collectors, and seasoned readers will be delighted with its multi-layered presentation.<br /><br />Kudos to Mr. Wong on his magnificent creation!<br /><br />For fun: when you get your deck, look for the tiny initials ZW hidden among the images.<br /><br />(To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews section at [...])y Horoscope Spread.

This series, geared towards ages 9-12, features three best friends--Juniper Lynch, Anne Donovan, and Gena Richmond--who use divination to solve mysteries, explain relationships, and understand life experiences.<br /><br />Avery School is opening up a brand new library, and students are giving oral reports on the book they plan to donate. Juniper Lynch, the truly psychic member of the Fortune Tellers Club, loves the Psychic Circle series. These books come with a fortune-telling device used to solve the mystery.<br /><br />Having difficulty choosing just one, she finally selects book 3 in the series--Grave Dangers. This particular book includes a pendulum, and Juniper explains the plot of the story, as well as demonstrates how to use a pendulum.<br /><br />The mother of one of Juniper's classmates complains to the principal and launches a community-wide campaign to expel Juniper, purge the school of \\"evil\\", and ban books such as Grave Dangers.<br /><br />Juniper, Anne, and Gena attempt to discern the motives of uptight, upright Mrs. Greeley and the fate of Juniper and the donated book by consulting the pendulum and tarot cards. The pendulum provides a clue that ends up shocking the FTC--and eventually the entire community.<br /><br />Based on the personal experience of the author, The Burning Pendulum is a bracing commentary on religious zealots who seek to ban books and ruin the reputations of others based on their fundamentalists views.<br /><br />I applaud Ms. Enderle for tackling this controversial subject. Beyond the insightful observations she makes through her richly drawn characters, The Burning Pendulum is a fascinating story about fear, hypocrisy, and prejudice--as well as the importance of the First Amendment. Highly recommended for young and old alike!	2005-05-22

At a leisurely pace, but rather quickly for all that, the small ignorances and awkwardnesses of the apprentice are overcome and disappear. If you are an experienced reader, you will find neat formulations and well-stated answers to difficult questions that you can pass on to your own students. In the process, a considerable portion of the vast practical lore of the Tarot reader is organized and preserved.\\" -Wald Amberstone<br /><br />Ruth Ann and Wald Amberstone-founders of the Tarot School and Readers Studio-combine two lifetimes worth of experience in their book Tarot Tips. What started out in 1998 as a free email Newsletter has snowballed into one of the major newsletters of its kind, answering queries from readers around the world. Mirroring the 78 cards found in a Tarot deck, the authors provide 78 practical tips in an engaging question and answer format.<br /><br />Refreshingly absent of dogma and pontification, Tarot Tips addresses questions most every Tarot user asks at some point, as well as clever reading techniques not found elsewhere. Various esoteric and astrological correlations are highlighted, as well as spreads answering yes/no questions and other queries.<br /><br />For example, \\"The Voice in the Card\\" is a technique where you draw a card and allow your eyes to wonder over the images. Eventually, you'll be drawn to a small detail in the picture, and this will hold a message for the querent-one most likely to have nothing to do with the traditional meaning. A student of Ruth's did a one-card reading via this method in the attempt to answer her question \\"How long will I be on jury duty?\\" Drawing the 10 of Pentacles, the student was draw to two greyhounds near the bottom of the scene. He then predicted that she would serve only two days. Navigating the labyrinth of jury duty, she ended up serving only two days.<br /><br />Regarding health readings, the authors provide some examples of physical symptoms and card correlations. For instance, the 10 of Wands could indicate overwork, headaches and tension in the shoulder and neck. The 2 of Cups could indicate venereal disease while The Devil may point to chain-smoking and substance abuse.<br /><br />Tarot Tips also provides intriguing methods for Tarot contemplation and meditation, determining birth cards, coping with the Tarot, and creating a Tarot Prayer Mandala. The practical aspects of ethical reading, creating spreads, choosing and cleansing a deck, reading \\"pop-outs\\", and much more are also covered. In addition to the wealth of personal insights shared by the Amberstones, they also offer resources such as books, websites, and deck publishers.<br /><br />This book is a wonderful resource that belongs on the shelf of both beginners and experts.

The Fortune Tellers Club is a delightful series by professional storyteller Dotti Enderle. This series, geared towards ages 9-12, features three best friends--Juniper Lynch, Anne Donovan, and Gena Richmond--who use divination to solve mysteries, explain relationships, and understand life experiences.<br /><br />Gena wakes up one morning to find someone else staring back at her in the mirror! Who is the pig-tailed girl with the plaid skirt, starched white shirt, and furry unibrow?<br /><br />At first, fellow members of the FTC disbelieve Gena. That is, until they see the reflection of the mystery girl for themselves! Gena has to avoid shiny toasters and reflective surfaces in order to hide this mirrored anomaly from her Dad's girlfriend, Rachael. Even worse, Rachael has invited Gena to a formal dinner-and this means shopping for a fancy dress amidst tons of mirrors!<br /><br />The stray cat she's recently adopted comforts Gena, but does this kitty with mis-matched eyes hold any clues to the mysterious girl in the mirror?  Using divination methods such as Ouija, tea leaf reading, and mirror scrying, Gena, Anne, and Juniper try to get to the bottom of Ms. Pigtails.<br /><br />Interestingly, I found this on par with the first book of the series (The Lost Girl). Suffering from flat characters and a bland plot, the ending did not really explain what happened with the mirror switch--or why.	2005-05-22

Instead of it telling you what Tarot can do, you'll determine for yourself what you can do with Tarot. By completing a series of thirty fast, fun, hands-on experiments, you'll conduct a personal investigation into whether Tarot works for you.\\" -Mark McElroy<br /><br />The Tarot has long been shrouded in mystery. Some people lump this \\"wicked pack of cards\\" with crystal balls, purple turbans, and carnival fortune-tellers. Others fear the Tarot, thinking it's a tool of the \\"devil\\" that has the ability to foretell the future (which, of course, includes impending disaster.)<br /><br />In his book What's in the Cards for You? Mark McElroy demystifies the Tarot once again, inviting the skeptical and the curious to venture on a first-person voyage of personal discovery. Rather than telling YOU what to think about the Tarot, McElroy has created 30 fun exercises so the Tarot can be tested on your OWN terms.<br /><br />This book contains 30 different self-guided experiments to be conducted over the course of 30 days. Engage the cards, record your experience, and then evaluate the effectiveness of each exercise. McElroy acknowledges that not all of the experiments will appeal to everyone. Yet, personal preference for certain exercises contain clues as to what you enjoy MOST about Tarot-but more about that later.<br /><br />Chapter 2 is the foundation of What's in the Cards for You?, because McElroy shows you how to tap into your innate power of association which will allow you to generate meaning for any Tarot card-even if you've never touched a deck before! He has also created a \\"secret weapon\\" template (which you can use in the book or download from his website) so you can decipher card meanings for yourself. The \\"secret weapon\\" is a clever tool for generating insights and creating applications for each and every Tarot card. As one familiar with the Tarot, I was surprised and delighted at how many new meanings rose to the surface after using the \\"Answering Mining\\" template.<br /><br />One of my favorite exercises in the book is Day Three: Suit Yourself. McElroy invites you to rate your satisfaction with life-on a scale from 1 to 10-in four different areas, and then write your score in the blank (ignoring, at first, the words that came after the blank):<br /><br />Material and Physical Satisfaction: ________ of Coins<br />Emotional and Spiritual Satisfaction:________ of Cups<br />Mental and Intellectual Satisfaction:_______ of Swords<br />Creative and Occupational Satisfaction: _______ of Wands<br /><br />Then, you find the corresponding card in the Tarot deck. Going by the personal meaning you attribute to the card image, you then convert the illustration on the card into a \\"tip\\". For example, my score for Mental and Intellectual Satisfaction was 10. I laughed out loud when I saw the 10 of Swords, which shows a man with 10 swords, plunged into his body. I immediately saw the message as \\"You're too much in your head! Calm down that mind of yours because your over-active mental energy is affecting your physically!\\"<br /><br />Although this knowledge came as no surprise, it was interesting to me that the corresponding Tarot card accurately reflected one of my banes.<br /><br />Another exercise I enjoyed is from Day Twenty-Three: Creating Compassion. Likening the Tarot to a mandala, McElroy demonstrates how you can take any individual that you don't get along with, understand, or are irritated by and see them through the \\"lens\\" of 3 Tarot cards. By doing so-with the help of his pointed questions-you can literally shift your perspective to one that is more compassionate and centering.<br /><br />A few of my other favorites include Deal Me a Story, Answering the Big Questions, Breakfast with da Vinci, and Exploring Past Lives.<br /><br />In the last chapter which asks What's Next?, you're invited to look back through the 30 experiments and identify the 5 you enjoyed most, and which day the experiments occurred. (Believe me...it's hard narrowing it down to just 5!)  McElroy has created a chart so you can highlight your favorite days, and then see which of six application/s you most prefer: Psychological, Creative, Educational, Predictive, Magickal, and Planning.<br /><br />For me, my least favorite experiments had to do with Predictive Applications. My favorites were the Psychological and Creative exercises. McElroy then breaks down each of the six applications should you want to study the Tarot further-and aren't sure where to start.<br /><br />If you wondering if this book has any value to those familiar with the Tarot (including Tarot readers) the answer is YES. I admit to having misgivings when I saw the title of this book, wondering if it would be a re-hash of the guidebook that accompanies the Bright Idea Deck (also created by McElroy). I am pleased to say that What's in the Cards for You? is NOT a re-hash of McElroy's previous works (I own them all), and presents fresh applications for the Tarot-including practical tips on how to put your own unique spin on the cards and using the Tarot for meditation, creativity, visualization, dream interpretation, and much more.<br /><br />Those new to the Tarot will be introduced to this enchanting symbolic world by one of the most adept, down-to-earth, and rascally of teachers.ng it down to just 5!)

Long buried, these symbols gestate within the treasure chest of life and, in time, can arise as the jewels of new and transformed concepts and vision. The unification and repetition of symbol and myth through the ages create a universal backdrop for the art of the Tarot of the Four Elements. The deck draws upon the icons and images of nature that have endured the passage of time, yet it is modern and near extraterrestrial in spirit.\\" -Isha Lerner<br /><br />The vibrant, folkloric cards in the Tarot of the Four Elements were created by artist Amy Ericksen. After finding out that a companion book needed to be written, she determined that she was more of an artist-not a writer. Renowned Tarot creator and author Isha Lerner stepped in to write the 198-page book, consulting often with Erickson.<br /><br />Through their shared vision, Tarot of the Four Elements celebrates tribal folklore, earth mythology, and human magic. Lerner introduces the deck by discussing the tribal art and symbols that shape our consciousness, as well as the magic of numbers, form, and color. In fact, she dedicates eleven pages to the archetypal associations of number and form-from Pythagoras to Fibonacci, Jung to the Kabbalah. From astrology to alchemy to Tarot, numbers and form play an integral part in expressing the symbolism of the psyche and of human drama.<br /><br />Along with numerology, the four elements also factor heavily in Tarot symbolism. In Tarot of the Four Elements, the Minor Arcana reflects traditional elemental components: Fire, Water, Air and Earth. Although some are quite symbolic, I wouldn't consider them illustrated pips.<br /><br />The 22 Trumps-or Major Arcana-follows closely to conventional designations except the Hierophant has become The Priest, The Hanged Man has become The Shaman, Judgment is Realization, and The World becomes The Universe. The card backing features four vertical columns representing the four elements, which are done in pastel shades: green and yellow for Earth, blue and white clouds for Air, yellow and orange flames for fire, and aqua and white waves for Water.<br /><br />The Court cards follow Page, Knight, Queen, and King designations, although some of the representations (namely Knight and Page) appear genderless.<br /><br />Those attracted to shamanism, Toltecism, and Earth-based spirituality will no doubt enjoy this unusual, colorful deck. However, I don't think Tarot of the Four Elements is a good first deck for beginners, simply because Lerner introduces each card describing the traditional imagery and symbolism-but then proceeds to give her interpretation of the cards in light of Ericksen's artwork.

Most people are familiar with their Sun sign, which is one of 12 Zodiac symbols. The placement of the Sun in your chart indicates the pathway your soul is following, and each sign is associated with one or more crystals. Using the gemstones associated with your Sun sign can help attract beneficial energies, balance out less desirable tendencies, overcome your karmic inheritance and connect you to the path of your soul.<br /><br />Each Sun sign is also associated with specific body parts, indicating areas where health challenges may occur. Birthstones can help with these ailments, as well.<br /><br />While the Sun sign is important, there are two other components of your natal chart that paint the unique portrait that is you: the Moon sign and Ascendant (also know as the Rising Sign). The Moon sign shows how you process and express emotion. Your instinctual nature, unconscious patterns and expectations are also governed by your Moon Sign.<br /><br />The Ascendant, or Rising Sign, is the \\"mask\\" you show to the world. It's the part of your personality that is readily seen to most-a \\"first impression\\" if you will. Interestingly, this face you present to the world may be far different than the inner workings of your Sun sign!<br /><br />The Crystal Zodiac by Judy Hall is an incredibly practical book that explains which gemstones and crystals correlate with each Sun, Moon, and Ascendant placement...and why. So if your Sun is in Scorpio, your Moon is in Aquarius and your Ascendant is in Aries, you'll get a comprehensive overview of the crystals that will aid you on your own unique journey.<br /><br />For each of the 12 Sun Signs, Hall provides an in-depth look at the corresponding birthstone, abundance stone, ritual crystal, and companion crystals. She then takes you on a journey exploring each Sun sign and how specific crystals help you reach your highest potential, deal with challenges, handle emotions, balance your thinking, link you to your soul's pathway, and heal physical ailments. Hall even provides a special birthday ritual for each Sun sign.<br /><br />The Crystal Masks section explains the Ascendant and what it reflects in a natal chart. Hall asserts that the Ascendant crystal for each sign is a powerful tool for self-development, bestowing confidence and helping you \\"own\\" the qualities of your Ascendant. For the 12 Ascendant placements, Hall explains how each one \\"meets\\" the world, the nature of its \\"mask\\", and crystal \\"confidence tricks\\". She also provides the \\"fairy godmother\\" blessings innate in each Ascendant Sign, as well as a wonderful meditation.<br /><br />For the Moon Sign, Hall outlines the Moon crystal, intuition crystal, and lunar crystals for each of the 12 placements. She explains the significance of your Moon crystal, and the positive qualities of each Moon sign. Because the Moon is associated with emotions, ingrained behavior patterns, and intuition, you'll find out what crystals help with exploring hidden needs, overcoming emotional blocks, developing intuition, and nurturing yourself. Two intriguing aspects to the Moon Sign section is the past life association and a specific ritual. For example, the ritual for the Aries Moon involves a Co-Operation Ritual, Scorpio Moon a Forgiveness Ritual and Cancer Moon a Tie-Cutting Ritual.<br /><br />Because we each possess a bit of all 12 Signs, Hall provides a full-color Crystal Zodiac Mandala for meditation and contemplation.<br /><br />The Crystal Zodiac consists of 144 glossy pages featuring dozens of full-color pictures of gemstones and crystals. Although gemstones may often be prettier and pricier, Hall provides the less-expensive correlations for each-assuring the reader that they exhibit the exact same qualities as their counterparts.<br /><br />Hall writes in an enjoyably lucid style, so this potentially complex subject has been rendered quite graspable for individuals new to crystal healing and astrology. Those familiar with Sun, Moon, and Ascendant signs will be sure to gain additional insights into personality patterns and past life ripples. Crystal healers will love the added dimension that the Zodiac brings to balancing mind, healing the emotions, grounding the body, and expanding the spirit.the exact same qualities as their counterparts. <br /> <br />Hall writes in an enjoyably lucid style, so this potentially complex subject has been rendered quite graspable for individuals new to crystal healing and astrology.

Because Mr. Rogers Neighborhood aired on my local PBS station, I had the privilege of growing up with Mr. Rogers and his puppet incarnations (King Friday, X the Owl, Henrietta Pussycat, Lady Elaine, etc.) that lived in the Neighborhood of Make Believe.  Visiting with other neighbors like Mr. McFeely (named after Mr. Rogers Grandfather), Chef Brockett, Lady Aberlin, Bob Dog, and Purple Panda was also a treat. Interestingly, my first husband (deceased) used to take trumpet lessons at Negri's Music Store (Handy Man Negri)!<br /><br />Decades later, I still enjoy Mr. Rogers Neighborhood--now in re-runs on PBS Kids. (My 6 year old son loves it, too.) Despite his passing over 2 years ago, Fred Rogers' generous spirit and legacy live on.<br /><br />Mr. Rogers' unconditional acceptance has comforted and affirmed children on the deepest levels. He never talked down to his audience, and wasn't afraid to tackle difficult topics that aren't even *touched* by children's programs nowadays. Rogers unflinchingly examined painful emotions, and gave practical, gentle wisdom on how to deal with them. He assured us all that we were special-and that no one could take our place. Often spotlighting the differently-abled, his curiosity and interest showed us that those who we might think are \\"different\\" from us are really the same, sharing--at core--similar emotions, fears, setbacks and triumphs.<br /><br />I picked up Life's Journeys According to Mr. Rogers in the book store, and began to tear up when I read one of the passages. I knew I had to buy it--and so I did. My husband made the comment yesterday \\"Mr. Rogers is like a spiritual practice for you.\\"<br /><br />And he's right, really.<br /><br />What surprised me about this book is the spiritual depth of Fred Rogers. Sure, I knew he was kind, compassionate, insightful, and curious-but I didn't realize just how deep his understanding of the human condition and of Spirit flowed.<br /><br />A few gems from this book:<br /><br />\\"Every human being has value. This is the basis of all healthy relationships. Through living each day as it is given to me, I've learned that. It cannot be `taught', but it can be `caught' from those who live their lives right along with us. What a privilege to be able to look for the good in our neighbor!\\"<br /><br />\\"There are times when explanations, no matter how reasonable, just don't seem to help.\\"<br /><br />\\"The outside things of life certainly do change and often quickly, but the inside things remain. Our parents and their parents and their parents-all of us-were created by Love. Love with a capital L.  And we spend our lives trying to recognize that we truly *are* lovable and capable of loving.\\"<br /><br />\\"We all have different gifts, so we all have different ways of saying to the world who we are.\\"<br /><br />\\"What's been important in my understanding of myself and others is the fact that each one of us is so much more than any one thing. A sick child is much more than his or her sickness. A personal with a disability is much, much more than a handicap. A pediatrician is more than a medical doctor.

It gives us an opportunity to see other ways to approach our experiences. We come into this world with such a pure, clear mind, totally connected with our inner wisdom.

I Love My Papi! is a Ready-to-Read Level 1 book which features simple stories, increased vocabulary, and longer sentences. Many of the words in this story are replaced with pictures that has the word below it in a smaller font.<br /><br />This wonderful story follows Dora and her Papi to places like the soccer field, a sailboat, the beach, and a circus. Dora tells how her father taught her to kick a soccer ball, swing a baseball bat, and slide into home--as well as how he coaches her baseball team, rides bikes with her, teaches her to bake, and so on. This super Dad even made Dora a tire swing (\\"he can make anything with tools!\\", she exclaims), and still has the time to tuck into bed every night and read her a bedtime story.<br /><br />This is a great book that celebrates the time spent between a father and his daughter. Aided by pictographs, young readers (approximately ages 4-8) will learn to recognize words like books, animals, cake, sandwiches, bikes, beach, sandcastles, popcorn, circus, Boots, and more.	2005-05-10

Today I have really exciting news. Someone new is going to join my family! It's someone who sleeps in a cradle, drinks from a bottle, wears diapers, and likes to be rocked to sleep. Can you guess who it is?\\" --from the book<br /><br />Big Sister Dora! is an adaptation of the teleplay which features Dora antipating the birth of a sibling.<br /><br />In this fast-paced story, Dora and Boots need to make their way home in time for the arrival of the baby. With the help of their friend Map, Dora and Boots travel through Spooky Forest and Nut Farm in order to get home.<br /><br />Along the way, Dora meets Isa the iguana (who will teach the baby about flowers, plants and butteflies) and Benny the bull (who'll give piggyback rides to the baby). Nut Farm is a long way off, but Benny offers to take Dora and Boots in his go-cart. However, Dora and Boots must help Benny put on the four tires--and they count to four in Spanish.<br /><br />Once they make it to Nut Farm, Dora and Boots see Tico and his cousins. She exclaims \\"Mi mami va tener un bebe!\\" (my mother is having a baby). Dora then makes her way home, where family members are joyously gathered--and the baby has already arrived!<br /><br />What Dora doesn't realize is that there's an even bigger surprise waiting than the birth of *one* baby...<br /><br />This is a great book that celebrates the birth of a sibling into the family. As a story, however, there's a whole lot of information crammed in, including complex sentences in Spanish (rather than several Spanish words scattered throughout).<br /><br />Athough it has a hurried pace, it's a good story that can help ease a child into the understanding that a new sibling will arrive into the family (should that be the case in *your* family).<br /><br />My son is enthralled with babies, so he really enjoys Big Sister Dora!.	2005-05-10

In Little Star, Dora and Boots must venture past Troll Bridge and solve the Grumpy Troll's number riddle (counting how many stars in the sky), go past Tico's Tree and then make their way to Tall Mountain.<br /><br />When they arrive at Tall Mountain, they must figure out a way to reunite Little Star with his friend, the Moon. Of course, along the journey, Swiper needs to be reminded \\"no swiping!\\"<br /><br />Little Star is a great bedtime story for young readers. If you're looking for a Dora book that teaches your child several Spanish words, however, you'll be disappointed. (In that case, you'd be much better off with Good Night, Dora! which teaches children the Spanish terms for 8 different animals.)	2005-05-10

Thanks to Show Me Your Smile!: A Visit to the Dentist, he's not nearly as anxious.<br /><br />This book follows Dora and her Mom as she goes to the dentist to get her teeth cleaned. The beginning of the story shows Dora in a waiting room playing among other children as they wait for the dental assistant to call their name.<br /><br />Once inside the dentist's room, Dora points out the chair and the light--explaining the purpose they serve. Dora then explains the process of taking an X-ray...and how the assistant will take a picture of her teeth to make sure they're healthy. She even describes how the assistant covers her with a heavy apron.<br /><br />Once the X-ray is taken, Dora points out some pictures on the wall...and on the next page are black-and-white X-rays corresponding to the pictures (so children can match the X-ray with the character). The dentist comes in the room, and Dora explains the different instruments on the tray (such as the mirror, floss, dental pick, and so on.). Dora explains how the dentist cleaned her teeth and relates the hygienic advice given (\\"brush after breakfast and again before bedtime\\").<br /><br />The dentist finds a cavity on the X-ray, and shows Dora the hole in the tooth (my son balks at this part). Dora explains that there's a \\"tool\\" that gets her tooth ready for the filling...and that it makes a \\"whirring\\" sound. (The \\"tool\\" is, of course, a drill. And not wanting to scare the child, they don't explain that they may have to get a shot to numb it...and that drilling sometimes causes discomfort.)<br /><br />Dora receives a new toothbrush and a sticker--and even Swiper the fox makes an appearance (his appointment is after Dora's).<br /><br />Understandably, a children's book can't get into the gory details of a visit to the dentist...but at least a book like Show Me Your Smile! will help make the first visit seem less threatening. This book also shows the importance of dental hygiene and why it's important for a child to brush and floss their teeth.k also shows the importance of dental hygiene and why it's important for a child to brush and floss their teeth.	2005-05-10

Along the way, she encounters her friends Boots, Tico the squirrel, Benny the bull, and Isa the iguana...all who have created beautiful presents for their Mothers in celebration of El Dia de las Madres.<br /><br />Of course, no Dora story would be complete without sneaky Swiper the fox trying to swipe something...and in this case, it's Isa's bouquet of flowers that she's about to give to her Mom for Mother's Day.<br /><br />Dora brings back the needed ingredients, and her papi (father) helps mix the batter for the special cake. Mami thinks the cake tastes delicioso!<br /><br />This fun story teaches children several Spanish words, including how to count one through six in Spanish. In fact, the inside front cover features a chart featuring 13 English words, the Spanish term, and the Spanish pronunciation of each.	2005-05-10
US	49524801	R2WBG85JEWIWFV	1401902057	128030329	Fundamentals of Spiritual Alchemy	Books	5	58	58	N	N	Learn How To Convert Lead Into Gold By Tracking Your Energy	In the 4-disc series Fundamentals of Spiritual Alchemy, Caroline Myss describes the energetic pattern of the mystical journey known as spiritual alchemy. Alchemy is the process of transforming lead into gold; thus, spiritual alchemy is the process of transmuting lead (places where we're \\"weighted\\" down with \\"stuck\\" energy) into gold (learning lessons and getting our energy into present time).  Myss teaches the listener how to become \\"alchemists\\" by tracking their energy through their personal history, the 7 chakras, and the 8th chakra archetypal realm of symbolic sight.<br /><br />Disc 1 (45:02)<br /><br />Myss describes alchemy as the \\"science that gives energy a tangible form\\", and how that, for many people, the majority of their energy is \\"non-local\\". That is, their energy is everywhere but \\"here\\". This happens when we allocate energy to people, attitudes, beliefs, situations, memories, and so on. By getting energetically \\"hooked\\", our energy gets \\"stuck\\"-becoming \\"lead\\". Myss observes \\"you have *no idea* how spread around the cosmos you are\\".  Citing the ancient Mystery Schools, initiates had to learn how to manage their consciousness and keep their energy within their own auric field.<br /><br />She then delves into the concept of archetypes, which are neutral patterns that serve as \\"magnets\\" that direct the activity of the psyche. Describing the internet as an \\"alchemical wonder\\", there is now no boundary anymore as to who can enter who's \\"brain\\".  The Alchemist is archetype is described, along with her archetypal model which includes 4 archetypes common to all (Child, Prostitute, Victim, and Saboteur) and 8 \\"personal\\" archetypes. (This information is the subject of her book Sacred Contracts: Awakening Your Divine Potential).<br /><br />Using Prince William as an example, she describes how he manifests the Prince, Knight, and Actor archetype...as well as a strong Hermit archetype like his father (Prince Charles). Myss also describes the alchemical questions we often ask during our lives-and how the first half of our life is about the management of spirit into physical matter, while the second half is matter back into spirit. Encouraging listeners to \\"train to remain in present time\\", she warns that individuals hold onto their \\"weight\\" (lead) because they don't like speed; however, lead often turns into illness, so it's important to go down the \\"spiral staircase\\" of the alchemical lab which resides behind our eyes.<br /><br />Disc 2 (50:24)<br /><br />In Disc 2, Myss asks the questions: \\"Do you know where your spirit is? And if you do, are you willing to call it home? If not, why?\\" She cautions against laying out your spiritual journey on the proverbial coffee table, saying a \\"vow of silence\\" is a much wiser course because you don't lose energy for the alchemical journey when you keep it inaudible.<br /><br />Myss teaches that there are 3 different levels of the Mystery School-3 levels of the psyche. She covers the Small Mysteries (external power and the physical, day-to-day world), and the Greater Mysteries (the internal realm where an individual learns to manage and retrieve energy). Unfortunately, she never clarifies what the 3rd level is, but I'm guessing it's the 8th chakra level of symbolic sight which she describes at length in Disc 4.<br /><br />Using the Orphan Child archetype as an example, Myss describes how this particular energy results in others NOT allowing you into the tribe, and that they are under contract to exclude you. This type of agreements is made with all the players in our life before we incarnate, and is known as a Sacred Contract. So while an individual may suffer the broken heart of exclusion at the physical level, from the archetypal point of view, it's an agreement made out of support for the soul's purpose. Indeed, the law of magnetic attraction draws to us exactly what we need for the process.<br /><br />Disc 3 (52:57)<br /><br />Myss illustrates the tribal nature of the 1st chakra, and how the 1st day of something is best served by a ritual (like christening a ship with a bottle of champagne). She describes the importance of being grounded by ritual, and explains how those with a Wanderer archetype never feel like they belong in a tribe because the majority has never been welcomed with some sort of \\"baptism\\". Myss describes at length the mechanics of the tribe/1st chakra, and defines superstition as a tool used by the tribe to take a chunk out of your will so they can make choices for you. She also delves into tribal investments/lead attitudes such as \\"illness runs in my family\\", and asks tough questions like: \\"How much of your creative, spiritual self does your tribe control and you're not even aware of it? How much of you is connected to group thought forms (religious, social, ethnic, etc.) and you don't even know it?\\"<br /><br />She then explores the 2nd chakra, which is the area of both creativity and control battles (where you are connected to others-lead weight to lead weight). She warns: \\"Control issues over memories-who was right and what really happened-is the biggest lead manufacturer because you don't even think of it as a negative thing...you just consider it a `memory'. The lead damage occurs when it becomes a mantra and you hold onto those perceptions.\\" Myss goes so far to say that \\"one upmanship\\" games of control based in anger causes malignancy in the ovarian area.<br /><br />Disc 4: (69:46)<br /><br />\\"The best way to see your life is as a story\\", observes Myss. In Disc 4, she explains the Orphan archetype at length, citing Bambi, Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz, Hansel and Gretel, the Little Mermaid, Cinderella, and Harry Potter as examples of this archetypal pattern. She goes on to tell a fascinating story about a woman from one of her workshops who was in the middle of incredible turbulence: her parents had died, she was an orphan, and because of the machinations of her brother, she was now excluded from a sizeable inheritance. As she explained her situation, which included how her brother's plotting backfired by disqualifying *himself\\" as well, Myss realized this woman's situation bore an uncanny parallel to the story of Hansel and Gretel. In fact, she helped with woman \\"see\\" the story, so she could use it to chart her own course for overcoming the Wicked Witch (the legal system).<br /><br />Myss teaches at length about the 3rd chakra, which is the seat of personal power and self esteem. She also describes her 3 column model. However, since this is an audio workshop, we can't see what she's drawing. She does, however, illustrate this model in her book \\"Sacred Contracts\\".<br /><br />The majority of this Disc is Myss' delightful symbolic explanation of the Wizard of Oz-how the house represents the Self, the tornado represents an out-of-body experience, the yellow brick road is the 3rd chakra journey to empowerment, the wicked witch is the shadow of fear, and so on. She even correlates the Tinman, Lion, and Scarecrow to chakras 4, 5, and 6. Interestingly, Myss correlates the poppy field (where they all fall asleep) to the Garden of Gethsemane-where the disciples of Jesus fall asleep, and he laments \\"Could you not tarry with me one hour?\\"<br /><br />Her description of the symbolism of Dorothy's use of the crystal ball is especially brilliant, and Myss explains that no stone or aromatherapy scent will help you until you transmute your lead into gold (as Dorothy did by confronting her fears represented by the Witch). When we become \\"weightless\\" as a result of alchemical conversion, the crystal ball then becomes an empowered talisman.<br /><br />The process of spiritual alchemy is not a mere curiosity stroll, Myss stresses. Rather, it's an *excavation* that takes time. She then goes through each of the 8th chakras, outlining the questions that need to be asked at each level as you begin to transmute heavy lead into the light-ness of gold.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />So far, this has been the best audio workshop I've had the pleasure of listening to. If you're not familiar with the work of Caroline Myss, you may want to read Anatomy of the Spirit and Sacred Contracts first before you listen to this particular workshop. For those who have already read those books, the Fundamentals of Spiritual Alchemy will add more richness and depth to what is found in those books.imself\\" as well, Myss realized this woman's situation bore an uncanny parallel to the story of Hansel and Gretel.

I'm Dora and this is my best friend, Boots. It's our first day of school today! And look, there's our teacher, Maestra Beatriz! She's on her way to school too.\\" --from the story<br /><br />Maestra Beatriz is riding her bike to school and gets a flat tire. Dora and Boots help Maestra Beatriz make her way to school with the help of their trusty friend, Map. The quickest way to school is through Letter Town and over Number Mountain. El autobus helps take them through Letter Town, which feature streets paved with letters. As children find the route with the alphabet, they sing the ABC song.<br /><br />Then, Azul the train arrives to help take them over Number Mountain. While the book doesn't teach the child to count from 1-10 in Spanish, it *does* show the numbers forwards and backwards so they can count from 1-10 up the mountain...and 10-1 as the go down the other side.<br /><br />With the schoolhouse in the distance, Dora's cousin Diego shows up on the back of a Condor. Encouraging the reader to say \\"Squawk, squawk!\\" to call the Condors, Dora, Boots, Maestra Beatriz and Diego rides on the back of the birds all the way to the school house. Before they enter the door, there are 8 items from Backpack that are shown...but which ones are Maestra Beatriz' school supplies?<br /><br />They all make it inside before the third bell...even fending off an attempted theft from Swiper the fox!<br /><br />My only beef with this book is that \\"Maestra Beatriz\\" is quite the mouthful to say over and over and over. I would have thought they'd pick simpler name to say for the story.	2005-05-10

As they make their way home, they say Buenas noches (good night) to each of them.<br /><br />The pages are thicker than regular Dora books, and the large, colorful flaps reveal not only the sleeping/sleepy creature, but also the Spanish word. For example, as Dora and Boots skip across stones in a pond, they hear \\"Ribbet, Ribbet\\". She says: \\"Hey, someone's making a sound in the pond. Do you know who?\\" When you pull down the flap, you see one purple frog that's happily asleep...while the other is getting drowsy. The words under the flap say \\"Good night, frogs! &iexcl;Buenas noches, ranas!\\"<br /><br />In addition to the frogs, youngsters learn the Spanish word for birds, bees, chickens, ducks, snakes, frogs, and owls. It's a great story for bedtime, because there aren't too many words to read. Yet, the gentle story will teach youngsters a variety of Spanish terms for 8 different creatures. At the end of Good Night, Dora!, her Mami (Mom) tucks her and Boots into bed.<br /><br />This book holds up well, especially since the flaps aren't the kind that are over little niches/holes imbedded in the story (what you usually find in board books or those with very stiff pages...some Arthur and Bear in the Big Blue House flap books come to mind).<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2005-05-10

The Kahuna obliged with a warm smile. This time he simply looked at Martin, straight into his eyes. Martin felt himself go. First there was the sense of intense motion, again like an explosion that was happening all around him, and then he was in the dark tunnel with the light at the end. He spiraled rapidly, with a force capable of tearing him apart. He closed his eyes until he felt everything stop.\\" -From the book<br /><br />Set in both present time and 464 AD, Dream Maker is a mystical tale by Grigor Fedan that follows the personal journey of Martin Devon-a meandering fellow who has just lost an important contract for his company. Hostilities brew at home as Jenny, his angry and critical wife, repeatedly confronts Martin-or ignores him altogether. Martin never seems to say the right thing, and his own anger issues boil to the surface.<br /><br />A routine visit to the bank leads Martin on a journey of intense introspection-which includes an impromptu trip to a secret island in Hawaii and a magical voyage courtesy of a mysterious Kahuna.<br /><br />Exploring questions such as \\"Why am I here?\\", \\"What is the meaning of my life?\\", \\"Why do certain things happen to me?\\", and \\"Why do I do what I do?\\" Fedan weaves historical accuracy with metaphysical themes like past lives, meditation, intention, and energetic co-mingling.<br /><br />The majority of Dream Maker takes place in the 5th century, where Saxons, Caledonians, and other \\"barbarians\\" pillage colonies once ruled by Rome. The Kahuna instructs Martin that he's to be a detached observer, and warns him against involvement, because important soul lessons are at stake.<br /><br />In the fields and forests of lawless Britannia, Martin witnesses brutal ambushes, political plotting, and warfare. Martin also dwells in a Seeker Colony imbedded deep within the lush woods, and learns how a community of shared goods and services live in harmony. He participates in ancient energetic healing techniques, visits the royal courtyard, and witnesses potential threats from the citadel.<br /><br />While history buffs will enjoy this novel-especially those interested in military and Arthurian lore-I was more intrigued by the portrayal of metaphysical disciplines such as \\"agape\\". This energetic co-mingling, also known as \\"communion\\", occurs when the sender envelops the recipient with his or her energy field in order to heal, pacify, and communicate intent.<br /><br />As Martin observes and interacts with mystics like Maria Lerna, Nicolaus, Eldyn, Mowan, and those in the Seeker Colony-as well as royals King Joannes, Queen Martigena, and their two sons-he begins to understand that not everything is as black and white as he thought it to be. Through practicing meditation and agape, Martin learns to ground himself and retain objectivity. In the process, he discovers how past lives affect individuals in the present, and that each person has played both \\"evil\\" and \\"divine\\" roles in the grand play of life.<br /><br />Dream Maker is an engaging novel with thought-provoking ideas peppered throughout. For example, one character says \\"Brutality is a cornerstone of creation\\".  But regardless of whether you agree with Fedan's spiritual views (and I admit to taking issue with a few), you'll be taken on an interesting journey with plenty of food-for-thought moments. In fact, Dream Maker played a pivotal role in my husband's exploration of reincarnation. Up until then, he really didn't consider the viability of past lives. After reading this novel, however, he was primed to read books such as Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls by Dr. Michael Newton which examines case histories of past life regressions.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of history, military or otherwise, but Fedan paints a vivid picture of life in Arthurian Britannia. I was kept guessing until the end, and didn't realize the parallel with Arthurian legend until Maria Lerna plunged a sword through a rock. The proliferation of punctuation errors was somewhat distracting, and I'm surprised the publisher allowed Dream Maker to be released with such sloppy editing. Be that as it may, if you can ignore details such as capitalized words in mid-sentence and commas following semi-colons, this novel is a well-written addition to the genre of mystical fiction. You'll likely develop new ways of looking at your life, the world, and other people, and in my opinion, that's a worthy result of any creative endeavor.was somewhat distracting, and I'm surprised the publisher allowed Dream Maker to be released with such sloppy editing.

The damage inflicted by patriarchal attitudes has created a culture of women who hate their bodies, and where parents give their children breast implants and liposuction as birthday or graduation presents. The cosmetics industry in America alone rakes in 8 billion dollars annually. Individuals allow their bodies to be sliced, stretched, lifted, tucked, reduced, or inflated so they can love themselves-or, more importantly, have the approval and love of others.<br /><br />In her newest book Divining the Body - Reclaim the Holiness of Your Physical Self, author Jan Phillips explores the graceful curves, sinewy muscles, sturdy bones, and pulsating aliveness of the physical self. Using the latest scientific research as well as mystical traditions and personal experience, she puts the glory and magnificence of the human body on proud display. This insightful, gentle guide attempts to un-do the damage we've sustained from living in a culture that teaches-and thrives on-our self-hatred by renewing a sense of wonderment, respect and appreciation for the rich terrain of the physical body.<br /><br />Phillips reminds us that the body is the \\"temple of God\\", and that the continuing creation of the universe happens through us as the \\"word made flesh\\". Indeed, energy medicine and quantum physics echo what mystics have known for eons: every thought and action we undertake directly influences the flow of our life force. Therefore, our well-being becomes a matter of mindfulness. This process of mindfulness is not the accumulation of facts, but the cultivation of feelings-for \\"there is nothing to learn, but much to unlearn.\\"<br /><br />Through exquisite prose and poignant stories, Phillips throws a sacred celebration and dares the reader to join in. She recounts the bliss of photographing birds roadside, and the excruciating pain of burning flesh experienced minutes later as a car hits her at 60 miles per hour. She shares the pain of being dismissed from a religious community, and the joy at discovering that the path she thought she was destined to travel was really a thru-way to something greater.<br /><br />A breath-taking travelogue of the physical and metaphysical body, Phillips takes us on a tour of the feet, legs, hands, back, generative organs, belly, heart, breasts, throat, ears, eyes and brain. She deftly weaves scientific discoveries (such as those discovered at the Institute of Heart Math and the Max Planck Institute) with subtle-body observations (\\"Our throats are like the flue. When we don't open them up, speak our truths, blurt out our feelings as they arise, the fire within turns to smoke\\"), and challenges us to express our authentic self, discover our grandeur, claim our voice, and know our priceless worth that stems from within. Encouraging us to display \\"extraordinary heroism in the realm of the everyday\\", this revolutionary work:<br /><br />\\"...calls us to take a stand. To stop colluding in the darkness of duality, to stop trafficking in negativity, and to let out, once and for all, over and over, the light within. To see through the veil of multiplicity to the kingdom of God within, we must act on the basis of what we feel and known from our own experience.\\"<br /><br />Divining the Body is peppered with a multitude of beautiful, profound quotes that are found throughout the text as well as the margins. Each chapter ends with a reflection, exercises, and a writing exercise aimed at re-connecting ourselves with a particular body part, promoting introspection, expanding perspectives, and igniting awe and gratitude for the Great Beloved that is in and around us. As \\"souls dressed up in sacred, biochemical garments\\", we're invited to see the body as a cauldron where alchemical transformation explodes into global transmutation. What's at stake, Phillips asserts, is life itself:<br /><br />\\"...if we don't begin to find God in the bodies we see in the mirror, if we don't reel our God in from the heavens and honor God's holy presence in the flesh and bones in our neighborhoods, we're betraying ourselves and the Divine.\\"<br /><br />This book is a rare gem that nourishes, informs, and inspires. I've taken my time savoring (and highlighting) many passages in Divining the Body, and appreciate the timely message that Jan Phillips has delivered so artfully to the consciousness of humanity.\\"souls dressed up in sacred, biochemical garments\\", we're invited to see the body as a cauldron where alchemical transformation explodes into global transmutation.

You'll soon see, feel, and experience the magic it brings.\\" -Sonia Choquette<br /><br />Renowned psychic, teacher, and author Sonia Choquette teaches that in order to see a real change in your life, trusting your \\"vibes\\" must become a habit. Now, you can have bite-sized portions of Choquette's insight at your fingertips with Vitamins for the Soul - Daily Doses of Wisdom for Personal Empowerment. An expert in the field of six-sensory living, Choquette prescribes 125 \\"vitamins\\" to be ingested daily. Whether you're in need of assurance, creativity, peace, or direction, these daily doses of psychic vitamins can help keep you focused and grounded on the path to six-sensory living.<br /><br />Some \\"vitamins\\" for your soul's nourishment include:<br /><br />Stop Asking for Other's Opinions<br /><br />\\"One way to remain true to your authentic self is to stop asking others for their input (unless it's absolutely necessary to do so). Stop soliciting the opinions of others, and instead ask your Higher Self for guidance. Remember, it's only when you follow YOUR spirit, YOUR guidance, YOUR heart, and YOUR vibes that you can experience true peace of mind. Countless opinions from others will only make it more difficult to hear your higher counsel. Let your rule be this: `I'll only ask for input if the person I'm asking is wiser, happier, and more balanced than I am.' Otherwise, do something completely new-ask you Higher Self instead!\\"<br /><br />Nurture Your Authentic Self<br /><br />\\"One thing you'll discover when you begin to activate your sixth sense is that what you're truly doing is nurturing your authentic self, your spirit. Nurturing intuition is actually the art of discovering and honoring who you really are.\\"<br /><br />Use Your Imagination<br /><br />\\"The most direct way to access your intuition is to use your imagination. Imagination is the front door to your vibes-it creates the world! Not only is it the source of your six-sensory ability, it's the source of ALL your ability.\\"<br /><br />In my opinion, Choquette offers some solid advice in most of the book. However, I feel some of her \\"vitamins\\" are a bit on the fluffy side:<br /><br />Just Ask<br /><br />\\"God cares for you so much that He provides you with love, protection, safety, inspiration, ideas, solutions, and everything else you need to grow and thrive in life.\\"<br /><br />The implication here is that if you're NOT experiencing protection or safety, He must not care all that much for you. Or, if you just follow those vibes, God will rescue you from every difficult situation like a deus ex machina and your life will be a pleasure cruise. In my experience, growing towards a six-sensory life often includes isolation and even difficulty-for the ego doesn't want to give up its control, and it certainly doesn't want you to learn to hear Guidance for yourself outside the confines of religion, books, or the opinions of others.<br /><br />Walk With a Gentle Heart<br /><br />\\"If you honor your intuitive soul, you walk with a gentle, joyous heart-the heart of a child.\\"<br /><br />While I agree that a life lived honoring the six-sensory realm includes a \\"gentle, joyous heart\\", getting there is often accompanied by existential angst, confusion, and self-doubt. It's not always easy to unlearn decades of myopic, fear-based perspectives on the journey to contented, confident six-sensory living.<br /><br />In her lucid, practical book Trust Your Vibes - Secret Tools for Six-Sensory Living, Choquette provides an excellent blueprint for understanding, discerning, and applying information generated by psychic impressions. Geared towards those wanting a quick psychic boost, Vitamins for the Soul attempts to simplify and encapsulate the wisdom found in her earlier book. I would recommend Vitamins for the Soul for those new to Choquette's teachings on six-sensory living, as well as enthusiastic fans that enjoy bite-sized pick-me-ups. However, for individuals wanting to go deeper and further into the realm of intuition, I'd recommend her book Trust Your Vibes instead.

But many of us don't know much, if anything, about our Moon signs. While the Sun signs correspond to the outer self, the Moon signs represent the inner self-our feelings, emotions, and dreams.\\" -from the book<br /><br />Knowing the position of the sun at the time of birth-known as the Sun sign-can yield important insights into the \\"true colors\\" of the essential self. However, knowing the placement of the Moon at the time of birth-the Moon sign-provides significant clues to the private side of an individual, including emotional expression, unconscious behavior patterns, and the types of relationships that are likely to be formed.<br /><br />In Sydney Omarr's Sun, Moon, and You, author Phyllis Vega sheds light on how both the Sun and the Moon manifests itself in all 12 signs of the Zodiac. The Sun Signs are given a nickname (for example, Scorpio Suns are \\"The Regenerator\\"), and she explains the character, personality, teen years, friendships, and love life of each. In addition, Vega includes a Compatibility Guide for the 12 signs. Interestingly, she doesn't regurgitate pairings. So \\"Scorpio with Aquarius\\" in the Scorpio section reads differently than the \\"Aquarius with Scorpio\\" in the Aquarius section. Sun myths, gods, and solar heroes are explained, showing us how the masculine principle and Yang energy affect the expression of the Sun.<br /><br />The significance of the Moon sign is also addressed, and tales of Moon myths, Moon goddesses, and lunar mysteries give insight into the hidden elements of Yin energy. The lunar temperament, emotional nature, and hidden self are described for each Moon sign placement. The hallmark of the lunar placements are described by the most prominent attribute (e.g. Moon in Aquarius = Unpredictable).<br /><br />While the characteristics of the Sun and Moon often complement one another, sometimes they appear at cross purposes. Vega shows how each Sun and Moon sign combination (144 total) form a unique working partnership whose strengths can be tapped for career choices and relationship decisions. By understanding how the Sun and Moon work together, we gain insight into why we do what we do-as well as the behavior and motivations of others. Are your Sun in Taurus and your Moon in Gemini? Find out how stable Taurus exerts a calming effect on the nervous restlessness of a Gemini Moon. What about Sun in Scorpio and Moon in Aquarius? Discover how the emotional intensity and determination of the scorpion meshes with the water bearer's ingenuity and independence.<br /><br />Sydney Omarr's Sun, Moon, and You is jam-packed with practical information including an explanation of qualities (Cardinal, Fixed, and Mutable), elements (Fire, Earth, Air, and Water), glyphs for planets and signs, planetary rulership, Sun Sign Chart, and Moon Table spanning 1920-2020. Famous historical and mythological examples of the Star Sign placements (both singly and in combination) give the reader greater insight into how these energies manifest in an individual.<br /><br />Despite the abundance of information, Vega style of writing is engaging and easy-to-understand. No prior knowledge of astrology is needed to make use of this book-only an individual's date of birth. While the Moon Signs Table can give you a close approximation of your Moon Sign, it's best to get a chart generated by a website like Astro.com (or you can order one from me) for the sake of accuracy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, especially for those interested in personality, motivation, compatibility, and personal satisfaction.

Thomas wants to drive on his own. Thomas starts to go. He can not stop.\\" -From the book<br /><br />Thomas Comes to Breakfast is a Step 1 \\"Step into Reading\\" book, and is also a write-in reader.<br /><br />Thomas gets the idea that he can run on the track all by himself...without the help of a driver! He ends up crashing into a house where a family is eating breakfast. Donald and Douglas-the Scottish twins-are called in to help Thomas out of the mess. They laugh at Thomas, and the family is mad at him.<br /><br />This book is geared to beginning readers and writers, and provides several exercises for children to do. For example, there's a page asking \\"What can you do on your own?\\" and the child is instructed to draw a picture of it. There are other sections to draw a mad face and sad face, a match the items section (very basic), mathing things that make you stop, and a section to write the beginning letter of four words whose picture is on the previous page.<br /><br />While Thomas Comes to Breakfast is supposedly geared to children of Preschool and Kindergarten age, the writing exercise is confusing and too difficult, in my opinion. The other exercises are age appropriate, however.<br /><br />Douglas and Donald laugh at Thomas and his plight, but this story is one of the mild ones with regards to the engines taunting one another.	2005-04-21

Thomas notes the excitement, and decides to look around. He was amazed that several of the cars were like none he had seen before: they were clear, full of water-and held an octopus and a shark! Thomas looks for his friend Salty and asks where the special cars are going. Meanwhile, Harvey was crossing the tracks with a fragile load of empty fish tanks. Percy was in a hurry, and noticed a huge shark looking at him from one of the tanks. He was so surprised and scared that he ended up crashing into Henry, who crashed into Harvey-yikes! What a mess!<br /><br />There's a neat set of trains that corresponds to this book-the aquarium cars. I highly recommend those, especially as companion toys to go along with this book.

They have just forgotten it over the years, so now what you hear is their sadness and fears. It isn't their fault, all those stories they tell. They believed the stories they were given as well. Those old kinds of stories create guilt and fear, but today, Cassandra, those old stories stop here.\\" -From the book<br /><br />Each one of us lives a personal mythology that is created from the stories we have been told as children. These \\"stories\\" are the beliefs, attitudes, assumptions, and labels that were bestowed upon us by parents, teachers, and peers. Eventually replacing \\"you\\" with \\"I\\", we began to believe what others told us about our looks, intelligence, and behavior. Unfortunately, negative and demeaning stories impacted our life and delivered crushing blows to our fragile sense of self-whether we realized it or not.<br /><br />Written by Gina Otto, Cassandra's Angel is a powerful tale that shows how stories of shame, fear, rejection, and indifference affect a little girl named Cassandra. Through an encounter with an angel that has accompanied her since before birth, Cassandra realizes that she doesn't have to accept the stories she has been told by her scolding mother, uptight teacher, rejecting peers, or the dismissive mayor. Rather, she could choose to believe that she was a bright light in the world-and that no one could change that story! The angel tells her:<br /><br />\\"All of those things people have said to you, they are stories, Cassandra-not one of them true. You are never just what they believe you to be. You are even more than you think that you see.\\"<br /><br />Cassandra's Angel is a compelling book that encourages personal empowerment, self esteem, and the honoring of children. Coupled with the wisdom of author Gina Otto, the vibrant, whimsical, color-saturated images painted by artist Trudy Joost expresses a wide range of emotional experience-including the power of realizing that we can always choose a different story to believe.<br /><br />Note: This book was a finalist in the Coalition of Visionary Resources, Best Children's Book 2002 and won first place in the Colorado Independent Publishers EVVY Award in the same year.uding the power of realizing that we can always choose a different story to believe.  <br /> <br />Note: This book was a finalist in the Coalition of Visionary Resources, Best Children's Book 2002 and won first place in the Colorado Independent Publishers EVVY Award in the same year. <br />	2005-04-21

She loved playing in the woods with her animal friends. They didn't mind that she looked different from the other children-her head was shaped like a square.\\" -From the book<br /><br />With school bullying on the rise, it's no secret that children can be cruel-especially to children who are viewed as \\"different\\".  In Little Squarehead, Rosa learns to cope with the stares of adults and the taunts of children. Her sense of rejection keeps her isolated from others until one day she runs deep into the forest, and cries beside a glistening stream. \\"Why do I look so different?\\" she asks in despair. As her tears fell, a mist arises from the water and a sweet, musical voice comforts her, assuring Rosa that all will be well.<br /><br />The voice beckons her to the edge of a crystal pool, encouraging Rosa to look at her reflection. Rosa is shown a vision of her true self that begins to transform how she sees herself-and eventually, how she sees others.<br /><br />Rosa visits the secret pool three times, and the voice unveils three powerful gifts that Rosa has within her: courage, confidence, and compassion.<br /><br />The author of Little Squarehead, certified psychotherapist Peggy O'Neil, is no stranger to prejudice: she's 3'8\\" \\"little person\\" whose motto is WALK TALL - BE BIG ON THE INSIDE. With wisdom and verve, O'Neil conveys the powerful message that how we see ourselves can literally alter our lives. When we see our true selves-and our precious diamond heart-we act with courage, walk in confidence, and relate with compassion. This revelation can literally change our world, especially as children (and adults!) understand and embrace the message presented in Little Squarehead.<br /><br />Artist Denise Freeman brings a uniquely personal touch to the story, weaving colorful paintings of 15 types of roses that grow in her neighborhood. There's a key at the end of the book so you can find the different types of roses, as well as play Hide & Seek to find the clever images hidden throughout the book.<br /><br />Celebrating diversity and promoting compassion, Little Squarehead delivers a timely message about beauty within-and how we can find it in both ourselves and others.<br /><br />Note: this book was a finalist for ForeWord Magazine's Best Children's Book 2002.key at the end of the book so you can find the different types of roses, as well as play Hide & Seek to find the clever images hidden throughout the book.  <br /> <br />Celebrating diversity and promoting compassion, Little Squarehead delivers a timely message about beauty within-and how we can find it in both ourselves and others.  <br /> <br />Note: this book was a finalist for ForeWord Magazine's Best Children's Book 2002.  <br />	2005-04-21

It had snowed a little each day all week. It wasn't snowing just then, but the sky was gray and threatening. `Looks like we're going to have to get out your snowplow soon, Thomas', said his driver.\\" -From the book<br /><br />Because it has snowed on the Island of Sodor, Thomas needs to wear his snowplow to keep the tracks clear. He feels silly wearing a snowplow, and fears that the other engines will laugh at him. When he agrees to allow the driver to attach the snowplow, his worst fear comes true: the other engines make fun of him, calling Thomas names and touting why they don't need to wear a snowplow.<br /><br />A huge snowstorm hits the Island and Toby is stuck on his branch line. Sir Topham Hatt enlists the help of the engines, but not even Henry can make it through the snow-covered tracks. Thomas remembers his snowplow, and offers to wear it so they could rescue Toby.<br /><br />Thomas is declared a hero when he helps to free a grateful Toby, who exclaims \\"I wish a snowplow would fit over my cowcatcher!\\"<br /><br />This story shows how our unique features can aid us in helping others...and are nothing to be ashamed of.

Now a professional astrologer, intuitive, and author, Shaw found herself fielding questions from her daughters and their friends about everything from astrology to tarot. She realized that there wasn't enough information out there for teens about these subjects. Her solution? Write a book about New Age topics for ages 12-18.<br /><br />Almost everyone wants to know more about themselves. Self-discovery and understanding is why personality tests and systems are so popular. Likewise, this is a part of the reason that many are drawn to astrology, tarot, palmistry, dream work and the like. Not only are individuals looking to understanding themselves, there is a curiosity about the future and how life will unfold. Curiosity about self usually leads to an interest about others: is another trustworthy? Would they make a good friend? Could they be a love interest?<br /><br />Teens are no exception to this curiosity and interest, wondering why they are on this Earth and for what purpose. Maria Shaw's Star Gazer is an excellent primer for beginning the quest of knowing and understanding self. Shaw acknowledges that New Age topics such as developing intuition and psychic abilities was taboo as recent as the 1970's, and it wasn't easy to find books about numerology, astrology, and other New Age arts. Of course, there is nothing new about the New Age, since it's really ancient wisdom that's been around for centuries that was forced to go underground because of the social or religious atmosphere of the times.<br /><br />This book is soft cover, and 308 pages long. It's almost like a workbook, with sections devoted for writing down thoughts and impressions.<br /><br />Chapter 1 of Star Gazer: Your Soul Searching, Dream Seeking, Make Something Happen Guide to the Future begins with a 58 page section on Astrology. Five pages are devoted to each of the 12 Sun signs. On the first page is a picture of the Sun sign, the astrological symbol, and the sign's color, ruling planet element, gemstone, lucky day, and number. Two pages are dedicated to describing the attributes of the Sun sign. An interesting element to this section is that Shaw actually addresses decans. Each astrological sign is divided into 3 decans; for example, the first decan of Aries is March 21-March 30, the second decans is March 31-April 9, and the third decans is April 10-April 20. There is a several sentences addressing the different \\"flavors\\" of the decans. (I must say, however, that both my husband and myself are Scorpios, and neither one of our decans described us accurately. In fact, they were way off.) There are whimsical, cartoonish drawings throughout the book, and in the astrology section, there is an illustration of the \\"Best Buds\\" of each Sign and \\"Best Traits\\". Also displayed are \\"Amazing Attractions\\", \\"Heart Breakers\\", \\"Worst Traits\\", and \\"Careers to Consider\\".<br /><br />What bothered me about the astrology section is that Shaw states that an individual's Sun sign sums up his or her personality. She writes: \\"Wouldn't it be wonderful if you could be psychic for a day? When you first meet someone, you can size him up and know exactly what kind of person he is: his likes, dislikes...his personality? Well, it's easier than you think. Just knowing someone's birthday can give you the inside scoop. There are specific personality traits associated with each of the twelve signs of the Zodiac.\\"<br /><br />I couldn't believe a professional astrologer would make this assertion. The sum of a person is so much more than the Sun sign--such as which House the Sun sign is in, where the Moon and other planets are located, Ascendant (which is really an indicator of the face that is presented to the world--more so than Sun sign), etc. I understand that this is an introduction to New Age topics, but it seems remiss not to mention these other importantfactors and to lead teens to believe that the Sun sign is the sum of a person. Not only that, she even goes as far to say that certain Sun sign pairings \\"don't stand a chance\\". For example, in the Scorpio section she says \\"Taurus is Scorpio's opposite sign. These two will find each other stimulating and attractive, but both can be hotheaded and like to have their way. Cancer and Pisces are well suited to the Scorpion personality, as is Capricorn and Virgo. Leo and Aquarius relationships don't stand a chance.\\"<br /><br />A pretty bold assertion! One of my best friend's is an Aquarius, and I've always had incredible rapport with this sign...perhaps because my Moon is in Aquarius and I have a good bit of Air in my chart. But guess who I tend to but heads with in life? Capricorns and Tauruses. (Or is that Taurii?) This may because I don't have a lot of Earth in my chart, but that goes to show how other aspects of astrology are more of an indicator for compatibility or the lack thereof. As I mentioned, both my husband and I are Scorpios, with lots of planets in Scorpio, but because our Ascendants differ, as well as the House placements, we are extremely different in personality.<br /><br />Still, the zodiac descriptions are pretty accurate and the whole astrology section gives a good cheat sheet to the Sun signs.<br /><br />Chapter 2 is on numerology. Shaw writes an interesting introduction on numbers and why odd numbers are considered as having a \\"stronger\\" vibration than even numbers (odd numbers are masculine, and even are said to be feminine), and other tidbits on the origin of numerology--including how numbers shed light on personality and life path. She then shows how to calculate your birth number, and describes the nine basic personalities, as well as the master numbers of 11 and 22. Shaw then goes to explain how to discover your numerology number for the year, which is predictive in nature. Several paragraphs are devoted to each of the nine \\"years\\" and what to expect for the upcoming year.<br /><br />Chapter 3 is titled In the Palm of Your Hand and discusses palmistry and the future. This is an engrossing section that discusses the life, heart, and head lines, as well as lines known as netting, branches, triangle, star, crosses, and breaks. Each section includes a sketch of a hand so you can assess your own palms and draw the lines on the blank hand. She includes key questions to ask such as Are the lines deep or shallow? Are there breaks, forks, or other indentations in your lines? Are your lines curved or straight? There are also hands that are drawn with the different types of lines so you can find them on your own palm. Shaw even shows you how to \\"age\\" your lines--dividing them up into decades.<br /><br />After your done examining your hand and drawing the lines on paper, there are sections on how to interpret the heart line (e.g. if your heart line curves up, you fall in love fast--but if your heart line is straight or has a small curve, you tend to be cautious in matters of the heart), the head line (e.g. if there's meshing or netting on this line, you need to learn to relax--and the longer your head line, the longer you take to make decisions), and the life line (e.g. very deep lines mean you have a lot of energy--a shallow life line means you have low physical energy.) Shaw explains how hand lines change as you grow and experience new things, and how some lines lengthen, shorten, or even disappear altogether!<br /><br />I never gave much thought to palmistry until I met a palm reader a few weeks ago. What she told me was so uncannily accurate (including information that I had intuited about my future and my \\"always thinking\\" bent), that I concluded that palmistry is much like face reading and graphology (handwriting analysis): it is a reflection of our personality patterns and a type of life map. Shaw's palmistry section provides great introductory information and includes sections on writing your own thoughts andimpressions about the different lines.<br /><br />Chapter 4 spends 85 pages discussing tarot. She gives a brief overview of tarot, how to know which deck to get, how to take care of the cards, preparing for a reading, and includes a 3 card Past, Present, Future spread as well as a 12 month, 12 card spread for the upcoming year. Each of the 78 cards have a page of their own. There is a picture of each card from the Universal Tarot, and a brief description of the upright position and the reversed position. I found the descriptions of each card to be pretty much the standard interpretation; however, I was somewhat surprised about comments such as \\"Nothing is impossible for you if you draw this card\\" for the Judgment card, or comments like \\"You cannot fail\\" or \\"You will meet your soulmate.\\" and other definitive, simplistic meanings. This is a book geared towards 12-18 year olds--and we're discussing soulmates? A teens life can feel pretty unpredictable anyway, but to guarantee things like fame and success and romance is what almost everyone wants to hear--but I feel the energies of the tarot are a little more subtle than the all-or-nothing descriptions of some of the cards. Still, Shaw does a good job of introducing traditional tarot to the uninitiated.<br /><br />Chapter 5 is devoted to reading auras. It's a very simplified introduction to aura colors and what they mean, and Shaw writes how a person can train themselves to read auras. She does a good job explaining how energy fields extend beyond the body and often contain color--and why it is that some people drain us.<br /><br />Chapter 6 is called Rocking Your World and covers the use of crystals. This is an engaging chapter, and Shaw relates a personal story about the use of rose quartz which is reported to help heal broken hearts and draw love. She describes how gemstones and crystals hold healing energies, and vibrate in alignment to different things--and how people have been using crystals for thousands of years to draw and create love, protection, healing, and prosperity. Shaw also discusses how to cleanse crystals and choose ones that are right for you. Included in this chapter is a Gemstone and Crystal Guide which shows you crystals that will help a variety of situations, such as attracting love, passing exams, removing negativity, boosting self-confidence, and aid in creativity. There is also a listing of 52 different crystals and gemstones and how they aid us and in which areas. Throughout this list are cartoon drawings of certain gems that add a bit of whimsy and interest.<br /><br />Chapter 7 is about using candle magic. Some people burn candles while they pray for specific needs, and this chapter talks about what certain candle colors represent, as well as carving names on a candle as a form of intent. Shaw tells an incredible story of a friend who carved her name and that of an ex on her candle. Although he was emotionally abusive, she felt that he would eventually change and come back to her. The resolution of this story (this friend meeting someone who looked exactly like her ex--and with the same name!) is remarkable. There is a section on Candle Intentions which describes 36 different situations you can use candle magic, such as making new friends, stopping gossip, for peace in the family, for aid in forgiving others, and to increase psychic ability. Also, which day is best to burn the candle, a corresponding color and crystal, and an affirmation for each situation.<br /><br />Chapter 8 is about dream interpretation, and Shaw discusses different types of dreams such as recurring, \\"pizza\\" (you know what happens when you eat pizza before you go to bed!) precognitive, warning, factual, inspirational, and visitation (when a love one that has passed on comes to visit.) A dream journal is recommended, and a sample page and questions to ask about a dream is outlined. A 10-page dream dictionary explains interpretations of dream elements such as colors, people, holidays--and objects such as doors, elevator, fish, police, rats, parents, etc.--as well as situations such as marriage, running, flying, digging, and falling. At the end of the chapter is a place to record your dream impressions.<br /><br />Chapter 9 is devoted to developing psychic powers, as well as how you find a reputable and ethical reader (tarot reader, astrologer, tea-leaf reader, scryer, etc.), how to prepare for a reading, and what to expect from a reading. Shaw then gives some visualization exercises to increase mind-reading capabilities. She encourages teens to not use these skills for fun and games, but to create a wonderful life for yourself. She leaves the reader with this wise admonition: \\"Use them for your highest good and those of others. If you ever use your abilities to manipulate, hurt, or control someone, negative responses will come back to you. Just like a boomerang, whatever you put out will return to you.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, I would recommend this book for teens and adults alike who would like to know more about New Age practices; it's a good general reference for the curious, and provides some meaty portions to take with you in the quest for self-understanding. Informative, user-friendly, and easy-to-understand, it would make a great gift for a curious teen or for anyone wanting to explore the mysteries of the ancients through a light-hearted, whimsical lens.writing your own thoughts and impressions about the different lines. <br /> <br />Chapter 4 spends 85 pages discussing tarot. She gives a brief overview of tarot, how to know which deck to get, how to take care of the cards, preparing for a reading, and includes a 3 card Past, Present, Future spread as well as a 12 month, 12 card spread for the upcoming year. Each of the 78 cards have a page of their own. There is a picture of each card from the Universal Tarot, and a brief description of the upright position and the reversed position. I found the descriptions of each card to be pretty much the standard interpretation; however, I was somewhat surprised about comments such as \\"Nothing is impossible for you if you draw this card\\" for the Judgment card, or comments like \\"You cannot fail\\" or \\"You will meet your soulmate.\\" and other definitive, simplistic meanings. This is a book geared towards 12-18 year olds--and we're discussing soulmates? A teens life can feel pretty unpredictable anyway, but to guarantee things like fame and success and romance is what almost everyone wants to hear--but I feel the energies of the tarot are a little more subtle than the all-or-nothing descriptions of some of the cards.

It is an attempt to bring together all the known details of this immense, continually fascinating subject, as well as provide succinct definitions and clear explanations.\\" - From the Atlantis Encyclopedia<br /><br />Most books about the lost continent of Atlantis are largely theoretical. However, The Atlantis Encyclopedia is more fact oriented, focusing on areas such as geology, oceanography, and astronomy, as well as the numerous folk traditions around the world which preserve memories of a great flood. The exhaustive information presented in this book is the result of more than two decades of continuous study and international travel by the author. From Morocco's underground shrine to Britain's Stonehenge, seldom seen solar monuments in Japan's remote forests to a cannibal temple in Polynesia, Frank Joseph takes novice readers, specialists, and skeptics alike on an intensive journey through Atlantean civilization.<br /><br />The Atlantis Encyclopedia-written in an alphabetic, encyclopedic format-also offers comprehensive information about the Pacific counterpart to Atlantis: the lost kingdom of Mu, also known as Lemuria.  A few of the topics covered in this book:<br /><br />* Viracocha, the early Inca culture-hero who \\"rose\\" from the depths of Lake Titicaca<br /><br />* Balor, the king of the giant Sea People in Irish folklore<br /><br />* Island of Jewels, the paradisiacal realm in Hindu myth. At the center of this island hidden by misty akasha, was a magnificent palace where all wishes were granted.<br /><br />* Enki, the sea-god of Sumerian myth who was a pre-flood culture-bearer from Atlantis<br /><br />* Numinor, J.R.R. Tolkien's version of Atlantis in Lord of the Rings. Tolkien claimed to have been plagued since childhood by nightmares he believed were past-life memories of the Atlantean catastrophe-nightmares also shared by his son. (Numinor was also known as Ele'na and Westernesse).<br /><br />* Ragnarok, the Norse \\"Twilight of the Gods\\"<br /><br />* Pleiades, also known as Atlantides, means \\"Daughter of Atlas\\". Greek scholar Diodoras Siculus wrote that the Pleiades were not originally mythic figures, but real women who married Atlantean culture bearers. Long after their deaths, they were regarded as divine, and commemorated as a star cluster.<br /><br />* Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who wrote about Atlantis in a 1928 serialization by The Saturday Evening Post called The Maracot Deep.<br /><br />At 312-pages, this reference book also features 16 full-color photographs and images, as well as black-and-white photos interspersed throughout the text. Questions addressed in this book include:<br /><br />* What was Atlantis?<br /><br />* Where was it located?<br /><br />* How long ago did it flourish?<br /><br />* How was it destroyed?<br /><br />* What became of its survivors?<br /><br />* Have any remains of Atlantis ever been found?<br /><br />* Will Atlantis ever be found?<br /><br />* Did Atlantis have any impact on America?<br /><br />The Atlantis Encyclopedia is a unique and valuable resource that doesn't aim to prove that the sunken capital actually existed.

Human beings have always been free. They simply have not known it.\\" -Neale Donald Walsch<br /><br />So, when was the last time you read a dangerous book?<br /><br />Hang on to your seats, because author Neale Donald Walsch challenges the sacred cows of every major world religion by daring to examine what God (truly) wants.  An equal opportunity offender, his singular, simple answer to the question \\"What does God want?\\" will surprise most, offend the inert close-minded, and thrill those who are already (all ready!) riding the wave of New Spirituality.<br /><br />Walsch, the author of the New York Times Bestselling Conversations with God series, explores two basic questions in his book What God Wants - A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question:<br /><br />1. Who and What is God?<br />2. What does God want, and why?<br /><br />Declaring that fear and guilt are the real enemies of humanity (and differentiating them from caution and remorse) Walsh traces war, world hunger, violence, sexism, racism and more directly to humanity's belief about God and what He wants.<br /><br />On June 23, 2004, the fascinating results of a scientific survey conducted by Harris Interactive hit the wire services: 69% of adult Americans believe religious differences are the biggest hurdle to global peace. This overwhelming percentage is evidence that individuals are starting to wake up and realize that humanity's beliefs about God and what He wants is THE biggest problem in the world today.<br /><br />For many nations, entire social and judicial structures are built upon beliefs about various interpretations of sacred scriptures. The major religions, without exception, advocate an \\"us versus them\\" Separation Theology. In the 19th century, Americans sincerely accepted the biblical story of Noah's son Ham to justify slavery. In that time, to raise one's voice in protest to enslavement would have been met with persecution, accusations of heresy, and possibly death.<br /><br />Yet, even now, many followers of religions such as Islam, Christianity, and Judaism justify discrimination, superiority (\\"specialness\\"),  indifference, hatred, and violence based on what the \\"sacred scriptures\\" say. At the risk of being labeled an infidel, subversive, or \\"lost sinner\\", Walsch sounds a clarion call that NOW is the time to ruthlessly examine what humanity believes about God, and what Deity wants from humanity.<br /><br />Walsch asserts:<br /><br />\\"When it comes to its most sacred beliefs, our society will not tolerate new ideas that violate doctrine-or even question it. Thus, we are trying to build a twenty-first-century reality with first-century moral, ethical, and spiritual tools. This would be akin to a surgeon stepping into a modern-day operating room with a very sharp stone. It is not necessary to build our tomorrows with such primitive tools. The prohibition against new ideas and new thoughts about God can and must be lifted. A new discussion about God and What God Wants must begin.\\"<br /><br />Fortunately for humanity, Walsch (and Atria Books) had the courage to open the discussion by asking difficult questions, presenting the global consequences of centuries of religious assumptions, and offering a compellingly simple solution to mankind's greatest challenges. Walsch examines ideas on morality, suffering, free will, death, male and female, money, sex, and so on through the lens of Separation Theology (which is what we've had up until now), and how those same ideas look through the lens of Unity Theology.<br /><br />While humanity is in some deep do-do right now, the good news is that we can choose TODAY to make different choices-including how we choose to see God, life, and our fellow man.<br /><br />Indeed, our very lives-and the life of the planet-may depend on it.<br /><br />As Walsch succinctly puts it: \\"We human beings do not need to be saved from the `snares of the Devil', we need to be saved from ourselves. We are threatening to condemn ourselves to Hell right here on earth. We can yet create Heaven on earth, but we must choose now very wisely...That new understanding can launch the Thousand Years of Peace of which it has been written. It can give birth to a Golden Age of Glory.\\"<br /><br />Amen and Amen.<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of [[ASIN:1571745874 The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present]] (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)aved from ourselves.

Wong, an internationally recognized Feng Shui expert, practices the Compass School variety of this ancient energetic art. That is, a compass is used to find a space's magnetic North first, and then the 7 other areas of the bagua map fall into place.<br /><br />A bagua map, sometimes called Ba Gua or Pa Qua, is divided into 8 sections:<br /><br />North: Career<br /><br />Northeast: Knowledge<br /><br />East: Family, health<br /><br />Southeast: Fortune<br /><br />South: Fame<br /><br />Southwest: Mother, marriage<br /><br />West: Children<br /><br />Northwest: Father, travel, helpers<br /><br />Feng Shui is the art of directing chi (life force energy) in the different bagua areas by arranging furniture, adding certain decorations and accessories, using color, removing hindering objects, and utilizing the 5 elements (Metal, Fire, Water, Earth, Air).<br /><br />Wong also explains the Black Sect School of Feng Shui, which doesn't use a compass. Rather, the 8 sections of the bagua change based upon a room's main entrance. She stresses that these schools do not mix, so when choosing one method over the other, it's important to be consistent. Whether you prefer the Compass School or the Black Sect School (which is what I prefer), Feng Shui Dos and Taboos for Health & Well-Being can be used for either system.<br /><br />This book provides several Bagua maps, as well as the colors, animals, numbers, seasons, and elements that go with each direction. Wong also discusses the generative and destructive element cycle, and presents the five-element Feng Shui Chart. For example:<br /><br />FIRE<br /><br />Direction: South<br /><br />Season: Summer<br /><br />Organs: Heart, small intestine<br /><br />Body part: Eyes<br /><br />Flavor: Bitter<br /><br />Sense: Taste<br /><br />Emotion: Joy<br /><br />Voice: Laughter<br /><br />Action: Itching<br /><br />Climate: Heat<br /><br />The majority of this 431 page book, however, features a singular recommendation on each page for topics such as art, fertility, desk, office, color, cleansing, kitchen, garden, bedroom, the directions, elements, and much more. Some of the Dos and Taboos covered include:<br /><br />Do position the spines of your books so that they're flush with the edges of open bookcase shelves.<br /><br />Do wear jewelry with fluorite, tourmaline, onyx, or tiger-eye beads to help you maintain balance while studying or working on your computer.<br /><br />Do notice that those who sit with their backs to the door in a meeting or conference room have less influence.<br /><br />Don't give sharp objects as gifts to anyone, as these symbolize the severance of a friendship or a life.<br /><br />Do prune the leaves of trees and shrubbery so that they don't touch the walls of a house, thus drawing the energy away from it.<br /><br />Do add more metal in the form of copper, silver, brass, or pewter in your home if your skin is dry and flaky.<br /><br />Don't design your stairs to lead toward a bathroom or the main entrance door of your home if you're remodeling.<br /><br />Don't create an imbalance of yellow in your home-too much of any earth color may cause you to worry excessively.<br /><br />Do add more wood in your home if you're feeling depressed, timid, or shy.<br /><br />Don't place waterfalls or tabletop fountains in the South area of a room or office-to do so symbolizes water extinguishing fire, which stands for fame and fortune.<br /><br />Feng Shui Dos and Taboos for Health and Well-Being provides hundreds of practical tips like these to promote harmony and health. Wong's sage advice includes the \\"3 Golden Rules of the Feng Shui Lady\\":<br /><br />1. If it isn't broke, don't fix it<br /><br />2. If you don't see it, it isn't there.<br /><br />3. Everything is fixable.<br /><br />So there's no need to worry if certain elements of your surroundings violate Feng Shui principle.

This purity is one reason why children love and trust them. This card deck and guidebook are written in easy-to-read language so that those who are young at heart and pure of intention can connect with the magical unicorns' guidance and help.&#34; -Doreen Virtue<br /><br />Noted angel therapist and clairvoyant Doreen Virtue, Ph.D. has created a beautiful 44 card deck based on Unicorns and Pegasus. Many of the words and paintings on the Magical Unicorns Oracle Cards were suggested by young Crystal and Indigo Children-thus, making their positive messages even more magical.<br /><br />An 85 page Guidebook accompanies this deck, and is pretty much like the Guidebooks that accompany Doreen's recent decks. She briefly discusses how to clear, dedicate and use the deck, and provides an explanation of each card's meaning. Like the Goddess Guidance Oracle Cards, the Magical Unicorns Oracle Cards feature a gorgeous gilt edging.<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but I really, really like this deck. Perhaps it's the strong Magical Child archetype in my psyche. I've used it several times, and the cards and messages always bring a smile to my face. At first glance, one might think that the Magical Unicorns Oracle Cards are simplistic and child-like. Yet, its profound wisdom seems to bypass the rational, logical mind and speak to our innate innocence, openness, and wonderment. This would be a wonderful deck for children to use for meditation, guidance, and comfort. Adults still connected to the purity of childhood-or at least, wanting to connect to that part of their consciousness-will enjoy this deck, as well.<br /><br />(To see 6 images from this deck, visit the Reviews section at JanetBoyer.com)	2005-04-15

In addition, it is intimately linked to both paths historically and philosophically. And, once we explore these links, we find ourselves arriving at the common ground that is shared by both paths, and that we have called DruidCraft.\\" -from the DruidCraft Tarot companion book<br /><br />Pagan practitioners and experts Philip and Stephanie Carr-Gomm have teamed up once again with artist Will Worthington to create a masterful Tarot deck with Wiccan and Druidic themes.  The colorful, sensual images of the DruidCraft Tarot-as well as the lucid prose of 192-page companion book-promotes the integration of masculine and feminine energies, the strengthening of our connection with the natural world, and the deepening of knowledge of the Self and the Universe we inhabit.<br /><br />While the DruidCraft Tarot is geared towards pagans, non-pagans will also glean profound wisdom and intuitive information from this deck. For example, I don't consider myself a pagan or Wiccan (yet!), but as soon as I began to look at these cards, they began to \\"speak\\" to me. In fact, I've yet to come across a set of Tarot images where I could imagine myself entering the scene and having a conversation with the people portrayed on the cards.<br /><br />This deck follows the Ride-Waite tradition of 78 cards, with a few changes to the Major Arcana. The Emperor becomes The Lord in the DruidCraft Tarot, and The Empress becomes The Lady. The Devil is replaced by Cernunnos, the horned god of fertility. The Christian tradition usually relegates the instinctual, animal, sexual and material worlds as evil or a part of the \\"beastly nature\\" in need of salvation. Druids and Wiccans, however, respect and revere this life-force known as Nwyfre, seeking to integrate and channel it in appropriate and responsible ways. Temperance is re-named The Fferyllt-\\"a Druid alchemist who combines the powers of fire and water to create harmony, balance, and transformation. \\" Judgment is re-named Rebirth, and features a child emerging from the Temple-Tomb of New Grange on the morning of the Winter Solstice. Standing outside the entrance, the Priest-Initiator blows into a ritual horn, summoning the re-born initiate soul to awaken.<br /><br />The four illustrated suits of the Minor Arcana are Swords, Cups, Wands, and Pentacles, and the Court cards are divided into King, Queen, Prince, and Princess-accounting for the different levels of maturity, as well as the balance of masculine and feminine energies among human personality and developmental stages. The 16 character types of the Court cards as reflected by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator are explained, as well as the four elements in light of alchemy and Jungian psychology.<br /><br />The DruidCraft Tarot companion book is rich with myth and spiritual tradition, as well as psychological and mystical truths. We are shown how the story of Ceridwen and Taliesin is woven throughout the cards, as well as the portrayal of The Alchemical Wedding/Great Rite which reflects the cosmic dance of the God and Goddess and the interplay between masculine and feminine forces. A detailed graphic of the Meeting of the Inner and Outer Worlds provides a great visual with how the 78 cards laid out in three rings reflect the journey of the soul (the Majors), the journey of the earth around the sun (the Minors), and the 16 ways through which the inner and outer worlds meet within the individual (the Court cards)-all within the context of the Solstices, Equinoxes, Imbolc, Beltane, Lughnasadh, and Samhain.<br /><br />The text of the detailed card interpretations begins with the Court cards, including the general meaning and keywords of the Princesses, Princes, Queens, and Kings. Next come the Minor Arcana, with the numbers grouped together. In other words, all of the Aces are discussed together, and then the Twos--all the way up to the Tens. General keywords and descriptions are provided for the pips (for example, the Sixes represent Balance, Integration, Union, and Harmony), in addition to the comprehensive individual card interpretations. Lastly, the Majors are described at length. A graphic of each card accompanies the description of all cards, which includes interpretations and keywords for both upright and reversed position.<br /><br />The back of the cards is mostly chocolate brown with gold matte accents, and are completely reversible.<br /><br />The last part of the DruidCraft Tarot companion book includes a blessing and dedication ceremony for your cards, a brief divination how-to, and six spreads:<br /><br />The Awen Spread - For finding the seeds of inspiration that can guide your life, and for observing the relationship between past, present and future in your mental, emotional and physical worlds.<br /><br />The Lunar Spread - For help in nurturing or giving birth to ideas or projects, or for exploring your creativity<br /><br />The Pentagram Spread - For help in your search for wholeness, healing, integration, and spiritual development<br /><br />The Hexagram Spread - For gaining insight into relationships and the inner quest for union<br /><br />The Spirits of the Circle Spread - For help in determining the influences that are affecting your life, and to explore your sense of identity, in search of the answer to the perennial question, `Who am I?'<br /><br />The Chalice-And-Wand Spread - For exploring specific situations or problems, or for general readings where a sense of orientation or direction is needed<br /><br />Two sample readings for The Hexagram Spread and Spirits of the Circle Spread are also given.<br /><br />-Conclusion-<br /><br />I am surprised at how hard I've fallen for this deck! Ever since I laid my eyes and hands on the DruidCraft Tarot, I've been using it exclusively for personal meditation and readings, as well as reading for others. The Death card in this deck is my absolute all-time favorite; I'm often discouraged at the traditional renderings of Death-the spectral, skeletal harbinger of decimation and decay. As a Scorpio, Death is (thematically) one of my favorite cards-so to behold Ceridwen (a lunar goddess and `Dark Woman of Knowledge') as a crone surrounded by symbols of transformation and rebirth is a wonderful experience. The book says of this card: \\"...Look at the tenderness with which the Cailleach holds the skull before she places it in the cauldron of rebirth. Letting go with compassion is an act of love, not anger. At the heart of death is pure compassion.

Lastly, the Majors are described at length. A graphic of each card accompanies the description of all cards, which includes interpretations and keywords for both upright and reversed position.    The back of the cards is mostly chocolate brown with gold matte accents, and are completely reversible.    The last part of the DruidCraft Tarot companion book includes a blessing and dedication ceremony for your cards, a brief divination how-to, and six spreads:    The Awen Spread - For finding the seeds of inspiration that can guide your life, and for observing the relationship between past, present and future in your mental, emotional and physical worlds.    The Lunar Spread - For help in nurturing or giving birth to ideas or projects, or for exploring your creativity    The Pentagram Spread - For help in your search for wholeness, healing, integration, and spiritual development    The Hexagram Spread - For gaining insight into relationships and the inner quest for union    The Spirits of the Circle Spread - For help in determining the influences that are affecting your life, and to explore your sense of identity, in search of the answer to the perennial question, `Who am I?'    The Chalice-And-Wand Spread - For exploring specific situations or problems, or for general readings where a sense of orientation or direction is needed    Two sample readings for The Hexagram Spread and Spirits of the Circle Spread are also given.    -Conclusion-    I am surprised at how hard I've fallen for this deck! Ever since I laid my eyes and hands on the DruidCraft Tarot, I've been using it exclusively for personal meditation and readings, as well as reading for others. The Death card in this deck is my absolute all-time favorite; I'm often discouraged at the traditional renderings of Death-the spectral, skeletal harbinger of decimation and decay. As a Scorpio, Death is (thematically) one of my favorite cards-so to behold Ceridwen (a lunar goddess and `Dark Woman of Knowledge') as a crone surrounded by symbols of transformation and rebirth is a wonderful experience. The book says of this card: \\"...Look at the tenderness with which the Cailleach holds the skull before she places it in the cauldron of rebirth. Letting go with compassion is an act of love, not anger. At the heart of death is pure compassion. We die to our old selves, jobs, relationships, homes, battles, so that we can be reborn to new ways of working, living and relating in the world...\\"    The earthy, animated images by Will Worthington provide much in the way of symbolism, color, and movement-making this a wonderful reading deck for Tarot newbies and veterans alike.

Secrets and Mysteries - The Glory and Pleasure of Being a Woman is one such book.<br /><br />Secrets and Mysteries will give you a profound understanding of what it means to be a woman. Full of passion, mysticism, and practical information, it will tap the source of your power at the depths of your soul. Through her own extraordinary life experience and her knowledge of native cultures around the world, the author reveals how you can activate ancient wisdom to become the magnificent embodiment of strength and grace. In other words, how you can become a Glorious Woman!<br /><br />In the first chapter, the author shares her personal story, including the realization that she was a people pleaser. This negative pattern hounded her for decades, much like it does for many women. Rather than listening to her own needs, she discovered that the major decisions she made were based on what others wanted from her. She began to ask herself difficult questions such as Am I willing to stop putting other people's needs ahead of mine? Am I ready to let go of the need to please everyone? Can I stop taking care of everyone else, and start caring for myself? These questions came on the heel of being told that she had breast cancer. Because it's a popular belief in the New Age movement that you \\"create your own reality\\", Linn longed for compassion, understanding and support but feared accusations such as \\"You created this. What's eating at you?\\" or \\"I knew you had to slow down, you were working too hard.\\" She was so judgmental of herself that she couldn't bear being judged by others. So she didn't reach out for help.<br /><br />She took a month of for some deep soul searching, and the cancer disappeared.<br /><br />The stories and struggles that Linn shares in this book parallel those of many women I've talked to, including my own. It's encouraging to read a book from someone who's been there, and how she navigated through self-doubt and trying times. It's also refreshing to read such honesty about her own personal journey, rather than an author pontificating on what others \\"should\\" be doing or how we need to buck up and \\"get over it\\".<br /><br />Chapter 2 talks about the historical roots of the Goddess and how to embrace Her. Linn writes: \\"Goddess worship can be traced from the Paleolithic period, as early as 2,000,000 B.C., until less than 5,000 years ago when God became a man. In other words, God has been a male for one quarter of one percent of human history, and God has been female for 99.75 percent of the rest of the time. A male God is a relative newcomer on the divine scene. Yet, in modern culture, there is an ingrained belief that God is, and always has been, male.\\" She explains that the distortion of female history and the Divine feminine has left many women feeling dispossessed of their spiritual identity as women, and that they have not been taught to explore their strengths. Linn also lists the names and attributes of Goddesses from various traditions and how to integrate their strengths into everyday life.<br /><br />Chapter 3 talks about the allies of women, including angels, ancestors, animal spirits, plant and mineral allies, as well as herbs, flowers, and tree allies. She also shares how to discover your own allies, and provides several lists for the meanings of personal totems from these realms.<br /><br />Chapter 4 covers the secrets of the shamaness, which includes honoring divine feminine cycles, discovering your spirit name, shape-shifting, exploring the lower, middle, and upper worlds, and shamanic power objects and symbols. Chapter 5 instructs women on how to access their inner warrior or the \\"holy bitch\\". Linn writes: \\"You can tell when you have truly awakened your inner Warrior Woman, because you will rarely need her.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 6 gives incredible practical wisdom on the shadow, including whereit came from and how to face it. Chapter 7 is about cherishing your body, and explains the function of the 7 chakras, the importance of self-nurturing, movement, and eating healthfully.<br /><br />Chapter 8 conveys the secrets of feminine radiance, including re-connecting with our senses--which is what promotes sensuality. The author shares an interesting Pleasure Quotient test that you can use any time you want to take a quick assessment of how much pleasure you're really experiencing in a day--and how to increase the pleasure quotient of even the most mundane activities!<br /><br />Chapter 9 addresses sacred sexuality, the healing of sexual wounds, and how woman can honor their breasts and their womb. Chapter 10 is about the art of adornment, including how putting on a make-up, clothes, and jewelry can become a ritual and a physical symbol of our intentions.<br /><br />The fascinating qualities of water and its connection to the feminine is explored in Chapter 11. Linn talks about the amazing research of Masaru Emoto and his experiments with water, and how water is a source of purification, rejuvenation, and healing.<br /><br />Chapter 12 is about manifestation and gratitude, and Chapter 13 extols the virtues and importance of creativity in a woman's life. She shares several methods of creativity, as well as wisdom on releasing the inner critic, finding your creative voice, and tapping into muses. Dance, writing, painting, and music are among the ways women can cultivate and express their creativity. The last chapters speak of how to reinvent, rejuvenate, and rebirth ourselves as women.<br /><br />The author's encouragement, enthusiasm and personal stories are infectious, and left me wondering how I ended up \\"forgetting\\" the feminine parts of my psyche! I found this book incredibly nurturing, insightful, and practical. Linn's words sparked a deep longing in my being that I'm sure many women also share.<br /><br />So why bother re-discovering the Divine feminine and embracing the pleasures of being a woman? I believe Linn says it best:<br /><br />\\"Like a great tide rising, this ancestral cellular memory is beginning to resound in our soul. Many women desire to return to the spirit of the divine feminine. In the deepest place within the female soul, we yearn to reclaim not only the part of our history that has been vanquished and the womanly traditions that have been expunged, but also the corresponding missing parts of our psyches...and until this reclamation is complete, we are not whole. Thus, it is immensely valuable that we begin to awaken the mysteries of the Great Goddess that dwells within us.\\"ow, including where it came from and how to face it.

The reason why Feng Shui In 5 Minutes is universal is because the author uses an international type of Feng Shui known as Dragon Door Feng Shui. The advantage of this system is that you don't need a compass because its principles focus on the existing position of doors--and it applies in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres.<br /><br />The entire text of the book is written in a conversational question and answer format, making the information easy to understand and apply. It engaged my interest immediately, and was hard to put down! There's so much information packed into this handy, 204 page guide.<br /><br />The author, Selena Summers, studied for many years with Professor Vincent Wu, a former Grandmaster of Hong Kong. She has been a Feng Shui columnist at Woman's Day magazine in Australia for 10 years.<br /><br />First, the basics. What is Feng Shui? The simplest definition is that Feng Shui aims to increase harmony in your environment. The most common pronunciation is \\"Fung Shway\\": Feng means \\"wind\\" and Shui means \\"water\\". Part of achieving harmony is assuring the balanced flow of chi (also known as qi or ki). Chi is best translated as life energy or invisible life force. Feng Shui maintains that problems arise when this life energy moves too fast, slows to a trickle, or blocks entirely.<br /><br />Feng Shui originated sometime between the second and fourth century B.C. in China. In fact, the first compass was invented in China not for navigation, but for the purpose of Feng Shui. The Chinese take their Feng Shui so seriously that during British rule in Hong Kong, millions of dollars were paid in compensation to people who claimed their Feng Shui was damaged by government buildings or roads!<br /><br />The energetic art of Feng Shui has spread all across the world and is used by people to increase vitality, harmony, health, joy, prosperity, and romance. The author shares some incredible stories of individuals applying Feng Shui cures and getting amazing results.<br /><br />What's interesting is that Feng Shui seems very commonsensical and intuitive. How often have you entered a building and thought \\"Eww. Bad vibes.\\"? Or you felt claustrophobic in a cluttered room? What about entering a house that felt open, warm, and welcoming? It may very well be because of Feng Shui. In fact, some architects believe that \\"sick building syndrome\\" is due to bad Feng Shui--also known as sha qi.<br /><br />Here is sample of some of the great information found in this book:<br /><br />Chapter 1 of the book covers Feng Shui basics such as history, Yin and Yang, qi, and the 5 elements. This chapter also explains that the reason Feng Shui works is because our outer lives and inner worlds are connected--and constantly influence each other.<br /><br />Chapter 2 is an easy guide to the \\"Nine Celestial Cures\\". Each of these nine cures affects energy movement and creates harmony, as well as boosting health, prosperity, and personal vitality. Mirrors are the first of these cures, and are known as the \\"aspirin\\" of the Feng Shui medicine bag. Another cure is household pets. Psychology and medicine have already confirmed that pets lower blood pressure and reduce stress. Modern science is confirming principles that Feng Shui practitioners have known for centuries! Other cures include harmonious sounds, goldfish, and plants and flowers. (Now you know why there is often a tank of goldfish in a Chinese restaurant!)<br /><br />Chapter 3 discusses the Ba-Gua, pronounced \\"Baa-Gwah\\". Ba-Gua means eight sides, and represents eight life treasures: Prosperity, Fame, Marriage and Relationships, Children, Helpful People, Career, Wisdom, and Family/Health. It is a visual interpretation of the ancient I Ching book, known as the \\"Book of Changes\\". There is an illustration of the Ba-Gua; Feng Shui practitioners superimpose the symbol on a room, house, or block of land to accessthe correct placement. Since the author uses Dragon Door Feng Shui, all you need to do is locate the main door and arrange the eight sections accordingly. Also discussed are the colors that go with each Ba-Gua point. One interesting pointer in this chapter is that an open fireplace at the Prosperity area sends money energy whirling up the chimney! Cures are given for this and other problems associated with the 8 \\"life treasure\\" areas.<br /><br />Chapter 4 is about harmonious home and workplace locations and addresses lucky and unlucky shapes, money magnet sits, neighbors and omens. Did you know that having a water view from the front of your home is excellent Feng Shui--but overlooking a cemetery is not. Cemeteries bring in too much Yin energy, but it can be remedied with things like lattice screens covered with vines or blinds on the window. The author also explains the Feng Shui of shapes of land, intersections, and house and room positions.<br /><br />Chapter 5 covers house shapes, room layouts, and workplace designs. Doors and windows are discussed, as well as side doors, garages, and staircases. While skylights are good Feng Shui, sharply sloping ceilings are not--because it accumulates qi. This is why it's a good idea to hang a wind chime at the lowest point of the ceiling. (One of the nine celestial cures is movement, but you've also got the added benefit of harmonious sounds with a chime.)<br /><br />Chapter 6 discusses good Feng Shui for the kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. In Feng Shui, only the position of your bed matters more than the kitchen stove, believe it or not! It's not good to sleep in a \\"Coffin Position\\", which is when you sleep opposite the doorway with our feet pointing directly towards the gap. Want to encourage romance as a single woman? Try pink or peach sheets.<br /><br />Chapter 7 covers good Feng Shui of living and dining rooms, studies, nurseries, and other rooms--as well as seating secrets. Favorable shapes for dining and other tables are round, oval, and octagonal. The reason tense political meetings take place at round tables is to reduce friction and encourage harmony. If you're a lonely single person, don't group chairs in odd numbers. \\"Happiness comes in pairs\\" says the Chinese proverb--so go for even numbers instead.<br /><br />Chapter 8 is about transforming your aparment's energy and increasing luck while renting. The author advises on high-rise block shapes, curved balconies, tall buildings, and so on. If your apartment faces a staircase or elevator, your home will be hammered by excess energy. Hang a mirror on a wall inside your door to reflect the excess energy back outside.<br /><br />Chapter 9 is about workplace and office success at home and away. Why is a door that is half glass bad Feng Shui? Visitors often see you first before you see them, which causes you to lose power. This is rather common sense, but staying at a job you hate drains your personal qi and keeps you in a state of disharmony. You're much better working at a job you love!<br /><br />Chapter 10 is about the four protective house spirits and harmony during home renovations.<br /><br />Chapter 11 cover trees, flowers, paths, and driveways. For example, and all-white garden is bad Feng Shui because white flower symbolize death and mourning. (In fact, the author tells a story in another part of the book about casinos offering the free use of white limos to Chinese high rollers. The Chinese refused, believing white to be bad luck because of its association with death.) This chapter also covers gardens and garden shapes. What shape driveway attracts wealth to a home? Circular.<br /><br />Chapter 12, called \\"Water Wisdom\\", addresses swimming pools, ponds, and prosperity. Pools generate a lot of Yin energy, so the author gives pratical advice on countering the affect of this excellent Feng Shui feature.<br /><br />Chapter 13 is about the color of good Feng Shui and a warning about clutter. You know, I've heard it said thatif you need an energy boost, clean out a closet or a small room and get rid of clutter. Every time I've tried this, it worked! Turns out it's a Feng Shui principle. A famous Chinese saying warns \\"Qi energy moves like a dancer and cannot abide a cluttered stage.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 14 contains magic Feng Shui rituals and easy steps to better luck.<br /><br />Chapter 15 addresses unsual Feng Shui questions. Have you been stuck in a rut for years? Change the position of 27 items in your life, including yourself. Shop at different stores. Try different restaurants.<br /><br />Chapter 16 discusses Yin Moonlight and Yang Daylight as well as lucky charms. A chart is given to locate your Chinese Zodiac animal sign and the corresponding lucky charms. For example, if you were born in a Dog year, your Yin charm would be a butterfly and your Yang charm would be a mandolin. You can buy items with your charms on them, use decorations and accessories that feature your charms, etc.<br /><br />The Appendix shows you how to discover your birth year element, with a complete chart up to 2020.<br /><br />I was surprised at how readily I grasped the concepts in this book--as well as how easily I remembered them! This is a great guide to practical Feng Shui that is immediately useful. The author covers many, many questions about furniture placement, doors, hallways, color, etc--as well as how to create a flow of harmony, prosperity, peace, and joy.

That's their job, and they love to be asked for help. So let them.\\" -Sonia Choquette<br /><br />Sonia Choquette-renowned author, vibrational healer, and psychic-is out with a new 52-card deck called Ask Your Guides Oracle Cards. This deck is designed to help you connect directly with specific spirit guides and Divine helpers as you navigate through life's transitions and challenges. By seeking guidance for present and upcoming life events with the Ask Your Guides Oracle Cards a direct link is forged to your personal psychic support system.<br /><br />A 71 page Guidebook accompanies the deck, and gives a brief overview of each of the 52 cards. In addition, four keywords are assigned to each card, which present concepts and energies that augment the card's meaning.<br /><br />The back of the box says that the Ask Your Guides Oracle Cards are based on the Minor Arcana of the Tarot. However, nothing is mentioned about Tarot in the guidebook, nor is any correlation discussed. There are no suits-color coded or otherwise-and Minor Arcana parallels are not at all obvious. Why this supposed correlation is mentioned on the box is a mystery.<br /><br />The colorful illustrations are quite beautiful, and each card is numbered making it easy to find its explanation in the guidebook. Other than the card explanations, though, there isn't much to the guidebook. The Introduction is little over 2 pages long and briefly describes a one card and three card spread. Various guides and helpers are assigned to the cards, but there is no differentiation between them. For instance, there's Divine Helpers, Divine Soul, Divine Teachers, Master Teacher, Spirit Teachers, Higher Soul, Higher Self, Muses, Divine Mother, Divine Goddess, Divine Healers, Healer Guides, Joy Guides, Warrior Guides, Prosperity Guides, Creativity Guides, Nature Spirits, Holy Spirit, Divine Father, Divine Mother, Gaia, Guardian Angels, Guardian Angel Michael, Inner Child, Venus, Aphrodite, and Spiritual Ancestors.<br /><br />What's the difference between Higher Self, Higher Soul, and Divine soul? What's the difference between Divine Teachers, Master Teacher, Spirit Teachers and Divine Helpers? There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the differences which could prove confusing. If Choquette feels there are distinctions in the spirit realm, why not outline them? Is there really a division in the spirit realm called Prosperity Guides? Do they work at the Cosmic Bank and make withdrawals and deposits on our behalf? Are they financial planners or do they just deliver the goods? I'm being facetious but the delineation of all these spirit helpers seems silly at worst and perplexing at best.<br /><br />When I originally tried out the deck, the card I drew held absolutely no meaning for me. I had my husband try it, and he got an equally \\"doesn't apply\\" message. (I don't recall this ever happening before with an oracle deck.)  I was planning on writing a mostly negative review of the Ask Your Guides Oracle Cards but I thought I'd give it one more chance before I began writing. I pulled one card and got some incredible insight as to the root of an issue that had been bugging me. Then I drew another, and it gave me a message that confirmed specific guidance I received intuitively earlier in the day (no help from an oracle-just an insight).<br /><br />Perhaps my husband and I were having an \\"off\\" day, who knows?<br /><br />The Ask Your Guides Oracle Cards are certainly unique and attractive, and while I prefer Choquette's Trust Your Vibes Oracle Cards over this deck, I feel there are many out there who will resonate with these cards-especially those who identify with the nuance of spiritual hierarchy.<br /><br />(You can see 6 images from this deck at [...])<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book:Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)8 from Hampton Roads Publishing)	2005-04-04
US	49524801	RKH1JNBETFKR1	0738705209	270132973	The Gilded Tarot (Book and Tarot Deck Set)	Books	4	78	92	N	N	Visually Stunning, But Lacks Symbolic And Intuitive Depth	Featuring vibrant images that straddle worlds mechanical and magical, as well as ancient and futuristic, The Gilded Tarot is a visually sumptuous deck created by award-winning digital artist Ciro Marchetti. Modeled after the Rider-Waite deck, the cards follow the traditional renderings of both the Major and Minor Arcana. Polished metal, silken garments and ethereal space-scapes unite to tell the time-honored tale of the Tarot.<br /><br />The Minor Arcana is fully illustrated, and just as much care has been taken in their rendering as with the Majors. I always enjoy seeing this in a deck, especially since the Minors are often treated as an afterthought. The outer edging of the cards is black, while a golden bejeweled frame encloses the central image. The jewel-like accoutrements are color-coded thusly: Black for the Majors, blue for the Swords, green for the Pentacles, red for the Wands, and orange for the Cups.<br /><br />The 150-page companion book by Barbara Moore provides solid interpretations for each card, and is especially good for Tarot novices. Upright and reversed meanings are not addressed separately, but rather, the messages and challenges inherent in each card are woven together as one. A black organdy pouch is also included in this box set, which is a nice addition.<br /><br />Visually speaking, The Gilded Tarot is the most stunning deck I've seen (except for Ciro's upcoming Tarot of Dreams!) I'm a big fan of high-tech, ethereal images, and this one delivers. It's a deck that belongs in every Tarot collection, in my opinion.  As far as reading the cards, though, several aspects are wanting. Firstly, the insertion of random astrological symbols-or the entire Zodiac itself-is a bit distracting. It's obvious that Ciro is a Tarot novice, and this manifests itself into the cards. Decks that are created/illustrated by Tarot readers carry a depth to them that's hard to translate into words-but is felt by those who read the cards. The Quest Tarot, Golden Tarot, DruidCraft Tarot, and Oracle Tarot come to mind as examples of decks created by enthusiasts/readers who either illustrate the decks themselves, or who work closely with the artist to bring about their vision.<br /><br />So while the images are slick, there is a lack of depth to The Gilded Tarot, in my opinion. The High Priestess, for example, features a lithe, masked acrobat draped in gossamer fabric. She floats above the water, head bent backwards with eyes closed, and stars sparkle from her cap.

So while the images are slick, there is a lack of depth to The Gilded Tarot, in my opinion. The High Priestess, for example, features a lithe, masked acrobat draped in gossamer fabric. She floats above the water, head bent backwards with eyes closed, and stars sparkle from her cap. While this is a gorgeous image, it brings very little to a reading.

How others treat me is their path; how I react is mine.\\" --Wayne Dyer<br /><br />Every so often, I would visit Wayne Dyer's website because of its neat random quote generator. Sometimes a hoot, but always thought-provoking, Dyer's pithy quotes are a treat to read and digest.<br /><br />Now, Dyer's wonderful insights are available in the 301-page book Everyday Wisdom-a collection of 300 sayings by the beloved self-development teacher. These quotes address topics such as love, forgiveness, the power of thoughts, internal and external peace, intuition, empowerment, authenticity, attitude, death, abundance, and much more. Here are few samples of Dyer's wit and wisdom featured in this book:<br /><br />*You're already complete and whole, and nothing external to yourself in the physical world can make your more complete.<br /><br />*No one can create anger or stress within you. Only you can do that by virtue of how you process your world.<br /><br />*What you think about expands. If your thoughts are centered on what's missing, then what's missing, by definition, will have to expand.<br /><br />*Go beyond the ideas of succeeding and failing--these are the judgments. Stay in the process and allow the universe to handle the details.<br /><br />*Our beliefs are the invisible ingredients in all our activities.<br /><br />*Once you've learned how to enter your inner kingdom, you have a special retreat within that's always available to you.<br /><br />*So many people are expecting a miracle instead of being a miracle.<br /><br />*No one knows enough to be a pessimist.<br /><br />Everyday Wisdom is great to thumb through for inspiration and to aid in personal growth. You could even choose a quote and meditate on it throughout the day-as well as consider how you might apply its wisdom. Or, if you're in need of guidance, ask a questions and turn to a page at random for sage advice.<br /><br />Not only is this book a wonderful addition to any library, but it would also make a meaningful gift for others.only is this book a wonderful addition to any library, but it would also make a meaningful gift for others.	2005-03-26

Even as I complete this phase of this work it is difficult to grasp all that has transpired from one brief phantasm on an escalator, beneath a statue, on my first day in Paris. From that experience I now understand that life can teach in a moment what our socio-reality will not admit in a lifetime.\\" -- J.Philip Thomas, creator of Tarot de Paris<br /><br />The vision for Tarot de Paris came unexpectedly. On a windy, March morning in 1981, J. Philip Thomas was walking on the Champs-Elys&eacute;es on his first-ever trip to France. Wanting to avoid the onrush of tourists, he made his way to the Louvre via the m&eacute;tro. As he exited, he felt the warmth of the sun on the back of his neck. Turning towards the heat, he became momentarily stunned by an intense light that was streaming out through a wreath held high by a female statue, riding in a horse-drawn chariot that seemed to be leaping right off the façade of the building.<br /><br />Thomas then has a supernatural vision of all the Major Arcana cards as a sequence of statues, located somewhere in Paris. (This was his first trip to France, mind you.) Somehow, he knew that he should immediately stop whatever else he was doing and set to work on finding and photographing these statues. The resulting images would then be assembled, by photomontage, as the cards of a tarot deck. The Tarot de Paris is the result of that amazing vision.<br /><br />This gorgeous deck features 78 cards presenting a dazzling array of classic and contemporary art and architecture found in Paris. There are 22 Major Arcana cards, with many of them re-named as follows:<br /><br />Fool - The Source<br />Magician - Initiation<br />High Priestess - The Veil<br />Empress - Nature<br />Emperor - Order<br />Hierophant - The Awakening<br />The Lovers - Harmony<br />Justice - Equilibrium<br />Hermit - The Recluse<br />Wheel of Fortune - The Sphinx<br />Strength - Presence<br />Hanged Man - The Question<br />Death - The Crossing<br />Temperance - Alchemy<br />The Devil - Energy<br />Judgment - The Angel<br />The World - The Universe<br /><br />Thomas has added a new card called to the Majors called The Spinner, but it's not available as part of the deck. Below are 6 images from the Tarot de Paris:<br /><br />The Minor Arcana is divided into the suits of Water, Air, Fire, and Matter. For the Court Cards, Queen and King are retained but two additional Courts have been created: Stallions and Spirit. The back of the cards feature the Rose window of Notre Dame Cathedral transposed on a black background. Because the image isn't centered, however, you will be able to tell reversed cards. Card dimensions are approximately 5.5 X 3.5 inches. The deck is accompanied by a fully illustrated book of 240 pages which details the meanings of the cards, as well as a number of new readings devised just for this set. Also included is a silk cloth for laying out the cards.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Tarot de Paris, especially if you're an enthusiast of architecture, sculpture, art, and the City of Lights.<br /><br />(To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])hinx  Strength - Presence  Hanged Man - The Question  Death - The Crossing  Temperance - Alchemy  The Devil - Energy  Judgment - The Angel  The World - The Universe    Thomas has added a new card called to the Majors called The Spinner, but it's not available as part of the deck.

By welcoming and loving the animals which enter our awareness through the Oracle, in dreams and meditations and reverie, we enrich our inner world and discover a way of personal growth that is completely in tune with the natural world.\\" --the authors<br /><br />The Druid Animal Oracle, created by Philip and Stephanie Carr-Gomm and illustrated by Bill Worthington, draws its wisdom from the ancient wellspring of Celtic tradition. The Druids, much like the Native Americans, revered animals as sacred guides and guardians. Featuring animals from both the Otherworld and this one, The Druid Animal Oracle provides healing power and intuitive knowledge from 33 sacred animals. This oracle does not encourage fatalism and prediction; rather, the powerful messages correct imbalances, provide advice on inner dynamics, and empower the querent to make--and create--more positive outcomes.<br /><br />In addition to 33 colorful cards, The Druid Animal Oracle comes with 3 blank cards for personal creation, a 176-page illustrated hard cover book, and a gorgeous reading cloth measuring approximately 20\\" X 23\\". The navy blue cloth can be used for spreads, and features exquisite silver embossing which includes likenesses of the four elemental dragons in the Oracle.<br /><br />The Guidebook that accompanies this deck provides both upright and reversed interpretations for each of the sacred animal cards, as well as the traditional lore of each--including the Gaelic name and pronunciation of the particular animal. Seven unique spreads are given in The Druid Animal Oracle, ranging from 1-9 cards.<br /><br />When I test out Oracle or Tarot decks, I like to do so when there is really a difficult situation at hand. It's pretty easy to get a \\"fluff\\" reading when all is well, but if an Oracle can provide insight and healing during critical times, then it passes muster in my book.<br /><br />I happened to test The Druid Animal Oracle during one of the most difficult times of my life. A month or so ago, I had excruciating back pain that prohibited me from walking or sitting. It got so bad, my husband had to call an ambulance for me. Three shots of Demerol, a muscle relaxant, and other anti-inflammatories provided me no relief.  My husband had to take a week off work to take care of me, and it took several weeks before I was pain-free. At its worst moments, the pain was worse than childbirth.<br /><br />Because the back of the box said that this Oracle could \\"bring healing and help you draw strength from its intuitive knowledge\\", I thought I'd see what wisdom it could offer me during this trying time.<br /><br />I did the Spread of the Elements, which is a 5 card Spread featured in the book. This particular spread addresses the West/Emotional, East/Intellectual, North/Intuitive, and South/Sensual parts of the Self. I asked for Guidance about the source of the injury, as well as healing advice.<br /><br />I received some amazingly profound wisdom that was spot-on accurate. Rather than being a superficial reading, there was deep wisdom offered that addressed both root and remedy in various areas of my life. A part of this wisdom, I feel, lies with the great care and enthusiasm with which the authors convey the messages of these sacred animals.<br /><br />This is not a deck to use \\"for fun\\", in my opinion. You'll be given corrective insight when inquiring The Druid Animal Oracle--and you may not like what it says. But it will be accurate, I believe, and it will be empowering should you choose to apply its wisdom.<br /><br />(To see 10 images from this deck, visit the Reviews section at [...])<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)ster in my book.

Your angels guide you through your thoughts, feelings, words, and visions. They also show you signs-that is, things you see repeatedly with your physical eyes. One of their favorite signs relates to number sequences. These are the numerals that you repeatedly see on license plates, phone numbers, clocks, and so on.\\" -the authors<br /><br />Renowned angel therapist and clairvoyant Doreen Virtue says that one of the most frequent questions she is asked by workshop attendees is \\"Why do I always see the same numbers wherever I go?\\" Virtue's workshop audiences love it when she discusses the significance of groups of numbers.<br /><br />Although Doreen included a chapter on the meanings of numerical sequences in Healing with the Angels, she has expanded this information into a comprehensive pocket-size book that elaborates on the significance of particular numbers. Both Doreen and Lynnette Brown channeled messages from the angels regarding the meaning of numbers, as well as applied their knowledge of numerology. Doreen is a life-long student of Pythagorean numerology, and believes she was a student of Pythagoras in a past life.<br /><br />Angel Numbers - The Angels Explain the Meaning of 111, 444, and Other Numbers in Your Life is a 306 page pocket guide which describes the significance of numbers 0-999-including 00. The authors instruct readers on how to interpret longer numerical sequences. For example, to interpret 2112, you would look up the interpretation of 211 and then 2-and combine their meanings. For sequences larger than three digits, the angels say that the center number signifies the \\"heart\\" of the matter.  For groups of number with six or more numerals, the meaning can be read in either in groups of two or three. Let's take 459136 as an example. You could look up the meaning of 45, 91, and 36 and combine the interpretation. Or, you could choose to look up the meaning of 459 and 136, and combine their meaning.<br /><br />The meaning of 459 is:<br /><br />\\"The angels help you remove obstacles in your life purpose. Call on them to get specific guidance and help.\\"<br /><br />The meaning of 136 is:<br /><br />\\"The ascended masters and goddesses are ensuring that your needs are continuously met. You help with this manifestation by keeping your thoughts attuned to the positive.\\"<br /><br />In combining the meanings of 459 and 136, the message is that all your needs will continually be met, and that any obstacles regarding life purpose can be removed with the help of the angels. By keeping your thoughts positive, and calling upon the angels, ascended master, and goddesses, you will be aided in the process of manifestation.<br /><br />Angel Numbers is a great resource for those wondering about the meaning of numerical sequences that repeatedly crop up around them. Many times, individuals wake up at the same time, seeing a specific numerical sequence on an alarm clock. Or, a series of numbers keeps showing up on billboards, license plates, phone numbers, invoices, addresses and so on.  With this pocket guide in hand, you can now discern what the angels are saying to you through numbers, and use these messages from the Universe for guidance and your highest good.<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of [[ASIN:1571745874 The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present]] (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)The meaning of 459 is:    \\"The angels help you remove obstacles in your life purpose.

It is available to everyone, and as we step into this flow, we become aligned with a larger vision for our lives. Our awareness increases, and we suddenly become aware of signs, symbols, and messages that leads us to our higher good.<br /><br />The Unmistakable Touch Of Grace shows us how grace knocks on our door in a variety of ways. When we begin to see situations and people with spiritual eyes, we notice how grace sustains, nurtures, protects, and guides us. Richardson shares many compelling and profound examples of grace from her own life as well as from friends, colleagues and clients. By awakening to the presence of grace in life, she promises readers that anxiety, fear and uncertainty about the future will gradually be replaced with the comfort and security of knowing:<br /><br />* You are not alone<br />* You have a higher purpose for your life<br />* You have what it takes to face any life challenge<br />* You are a student in the school of life<br />* You have the peace and happiness you desire already within you<br /><br />One way grace touches us is through what Richardson calls \\"spiritual change agents\\". These are the people who raise our level of consciousness in some way, as well as support our spiritual progress. While loving and empathetic individuals may ignite grace in our lives, the author reminds us that challenging and difficult relationships do so as well. What could look like rejection from one point of view could very well be protection when seen through the eyes of grace.<br /><br />She goes on to describe the effects of grace-such as a profound awakening to beauty and evolving to new levels of wisdom-and how grace introduces itself in work, relationships, and quietude. We are challenged to search for the evidence of grace, and each chapter ends with several experiments designed to help us recognize the power of grace in our own life. Becoming a \\"spiritual scientist\\" will alter our view of the world forever, and dramatically increase our ability to see the influence of grace, she asserts. We are invited to \\"dance\\" with grace, which includes partnering with a Higher Power, surrendering to the \\"music\\", and trusting Diving timing. Also at the end of each chapter is a resource section of books, audios, and websites to help further spiritual exploration.<br /><br />I found this book so timely and encouraging that I'm beginning to read it again--from the beginning--committing to do the experiments and journaling exercises at the end of every chapter. In a world often marked by cynicism, religious disenfranchisement, self-imposed isolation, anxiety, information overload and spiritual disconnection, The Unmistakable Touch Of Grace is a brilliant beacon of inspiration and hope. Richardson shows us that grace isn't reserved for mystics, monks, or saints but may be received, recognized, appropriated, and imparted by everyone. Her humility, candor, and enthusiasm are refreshing. I get a strong sense that Richardson is someone who walks her talk, rather than a teacher who admonishes \\"do as I say, not as I do.\\" And, quite frankly, this sense of integrity is one of the most refreshing elements of The Unmistakable Touch Of Grace.tude.

With the Bright Idea Deck, you can deal yourself an idea, solution, or new perspective!<br /><br />Creativity consultant, Tarot teacher and author Mark McElroy has created an ingenious, practical, and portable brainstorming tool: a powerful idea processor disguised as a deck of cards. This box set includes the deck, companion book, and white cardboard box for deck storage. Tarot enthusiasts will recognize the astrological symbols peppered throughout the cards, while Qabalists will easily identify the meanings of Hebrew letters portrayed in the cards. (For example, Cheth, the letter associated with The Chariot, means \\"fence\\"--and this card shows a Segway busting through a nice white picket!)<br /><br />The Bright Idea Deck features 78 colorful cards illustrated by Eric Hotz which provide multiple perspectives for any situation including:<br /><br />*Writer's block<br />*Brainstorming sessions<br />*Personal problems<br />*Sales, marketing, and advertising ideas<br />*Conflict resolution<br />*Pinpointing issues, motivations, assumptions, and overlooked factors<br />*Generating questions, options, and solutions<br />*Weighing pros and cons<br />*Building effective plans<br /><br />In fact, you can even use the The Bright Idea Deck for ice breakers, attention-getting games, memory aids, and date or dinner ideas!

These cards represent methods, motivations, and influences that deserve special attention.<br /><br />Suit Cards The other 56 cards are divided into four suits: red, blue, yellow, and green.<br /><br />Red cards address actions, desires, goals and intentions. This suit is a version of the traditional Fire/Wands suit in Tarot.<br /><br />Blue cards address emotions, feelings, perceptions, intuitions, reactions, and prejudices. This suit is a version of the traditional Water/Cups suit in Tarot.<br /><br />Yellow cards address decision making, logic, mathematics, strategies, responses, judgment, and reasoning. This suit is a version of the traditional Air/Swords suit in Tarot.<br /><br />Green cards address material resources, the five senses, physical objects, and the environment.

Civilizations both ancient and modern have used crystals and stones for jewelry, talismans, and home ornamentation. In addition to these uses, crystals have also been a part of sacred ceremonies, prayer, meditation, and healing.<br /><br />Using a process called piezoelectricity, crystals serve as powerful energy conductors and amplifiers. Crystals are used in watches, radios, and other electronic devices and crystal sensors are even used in hospitals for diagnostic and healing work.<br /><br />Because crystals amplify and conduct energy, they serve as excellent channels of Divine light and healing intention. In addition to human intention, the formation and color of crystals also contribute to specific healing properties.<br /><br />In the new book Crystal Therapy - How to Heal and Empower Your Life with Crystal Energy authors Doreen Virtue and Judith Lukomski share their wisdom of \\"crystal friends\\", and how these elemental beings are the offspring of Heaven and Earth's marriage. A gift from Gaia-the spirit of our planet-these healing stones are available for healing, grounding, and supporting virtually any area of life. Whether you seek to heal an animal, meditate for world peace, attract abundance, or ameliorate dis-ease, crystals and stones are valuable allies.<br /><br />The authors provide an introduction to crystal therapy, an overview of the four ways in which crystal deposits are formed, and an explanation of how crystalline structures reflect the sacred geometry of Platonic Solids. Putting crystal therapy in practice through intention and methods such as chakra balancing, angelic communication, astral travel and Feng Shui are also explained, as well as the purpose and character of 15 archangels. Other fascinating elements covered in Crystal Therapy include crystal selection and care (including cleansing and charging), and how to create eleven different crystal grids as an energetic framework for purposes such as world peace, healing, creativity and sleep.<br /><br />When using clear quartz for healing, practitioners often use jargon to describe the various characteristics of the stone. The authors explain this terminology, and pictures of each are provided. These include phantoms, record keepers, generators, double terminated, manifestation, time links, and others.<br /><br />The bulk of Crystal Therapy, however, is a directory of over 90 crystals outlining their healing properties, color/s, pronunciation, and the archangel/s associated with each. In addition to a channeled message from each of the stones, color photographs of most crystals are provided.<br /><br />At 220 pages, Crystal Therapy is a solid contribution to the field of crystal healing--especially for those interested in angels and crystal channeling.<br /><br />If, however, you are interested in crystal properties such as chemical compositions, hardness, and extensive astrological correlations-as well as the history and legend of over 140 stones and crystals accompanied by large, color photographs-I'd recommend Healing Crystals and Gemstones - From Amethyst to Zircon by Dr. Flora Peschek-Bohmer and Gisela Schreiber. Or, if you are looking for a book that addresses magical properties and intentions, planetary and elemental rulers, and stone symbolism-as well as how to use stones for divination and spells-you'd be better off with Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Crystal, Gem, and Metal Magic by Scott Cunningham (which includes a 16 page insert of color photographs of over 100 crystals, stones, and metals.)<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of [[ASIN:1571745874 The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present]] (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)Cards, Understand the Present]] (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)	2005-02-21

Using the Sabian Oracle will help you discover what's going on and why, leading to deeper self-awareness. You are able to make more informed choices and greatly enhance your life.\\" Lynda Hill, author of 360 Degrees of Wisdom - Charting Your Destiny With The Sabian Oracle<br /><br />In 1925, an extraordinary thing happened: two people--a clairvoyant medium and an astrologer--received messages from the spirit world for every degree of the Zodiac. Within each of the 12 constellations of the Zodiac, also known as Sun Signs, are 30 degrees--for a total of 360 degrees.<br /><br />Astrologer Marc Edmund Jones wanted to participate in an experiment with his spiritualist-medium friend Elsie Wheeler. A gifted clairvoyant, Miss Wheeler was afflicted with severe arthritis and confined to a wheelchair, making movement difficult and painful. Nevertheless, she agreed to participate in this experiment with Jones in a public park; he wanted to be surrounded by the vibrations of modern American life, but not be disturbed by passers-by. Thus, Balboa Park in San Diego was the birthplace of the Sabian Symbols.<br /><br />Jones made up a set of 360 index cards that were blank, save for a small notation of the Sign and degree number on one side (e.g. Aries 1, Scorpio 20--all the way up to Pisces 30). Jones shuffled the cards and placed the blank side up before Miss Wheeler. Neither of them knew the Sign or number on the card. Miss Wheeler would then report what she saw in her mind's eye...hurriedly noting the information on the card.<br /><br />Amazingly, Elsie's psychic visions formulated the entire Sabian Symbols at random--completing all 360 Symbols in one day! On average, Miss Wheeler would have had to visualize a Symbol every minute and half. Jones believed that Miss Wheeler was given information by an \\"unseen agency\\": a \\"Brother\\" from the Sabian Brotherhood who were an ancient Middle Eastern race of alchemists. The Sabian Symbols are a set of 360 phrases consisting of as little as two words (Virgo 2: \\"A Harem\\") to as many as 21 words (Taurus 5: \\"A Youthful Widow, Fresh and Soul-Cleansed from Grief, Kneels at an Open Grave to Receive the Secret of Eternal Life\\").<br /><br />Author Lynda Hill has a crafted an amazing book and oracle based on the Sabian Symbols: 360 Degrees of Wisdom - Charting Your Destiny With The Sabian Oracle. This book includes 42 cards to perform a reading: 12 red cards for the Signs, and 30 blue cards for each degree. Ask a question, pick a blue and red card, and then let the Symbols guide you to an answer. An entire page is dedicated to each Symbol, and features a commentary, oracle message, keywords, and a caution. In the page margins, Ms. Hill has included 5-9 quotations that reflect the message of each Symbol. At 363 pages, 360 Degrees of Wisdom also features Birthday Tables, which shows you the 3 degrees relevant to your birth date. She profiles several celebrities--such as Deepak Chopra, Michael Jackson, and Princess Diana--to demonstrate how the Sabian Symbols mirror the circumstances of your life.<br /><br />In addition to using the cards provided with the book, Ms. Hill also shows you how to use 2 decks of regular playing cards (one red, one blue) in case you lose the cards that came with the book. She also shows you how to open the book at random to receive your special message.<br /><br />I used the Sabian Oracle last night for insight into a back ailment that I've been dealing with. I picked a blue card and red card at random to get Scorpio: 20. Chillingly accurate, Scorpio: 20 A Woman Drawing Aside Two Dark Curtains That Closed The Entrance To A Sacred Pathway is not only the exact degree of Mercury in my natal chart (and one degree away from my Venus placement), but also this Sabian Symbol echoed the message I received from another oracleconsulted a few days prior.<br /><br />More accessible than the Tarot and easier to use than the I Ching, 360 Degrees of Wisdom - Charting Your Destiny With The Sabian Oracle will help you discover a modern and fascinating branch of mysticism and symbolic readings. I highly recommend this insightful and comprehensive book!the Tarot and easier to use than the I Ching, 360 Degrees of Wisdom - Charting Your Destiny With The Sabian Oracle will help you discover a modern and fascinating branch of mysticism and symbolic readings.

I've walked the paths and used myself as a psychic barometer first, and then I've gone back to see if I could prove what I telepathically picked up using research, statistics, eyewitness accounts, and sometimes just good ol' common sense.\\" - Sylvia Browne<br /><br />The Bermuda Triangle, crop circles, stigmata, the crystal skulls, and spontaneous human combustion are fascinating and puzzling phenomena. As a child, I remember eagerly watching the TV show In Search Of..., hosted by Leonard Nimoy. At times frightened, I couldn't sate my curiosity when presented with unexplained mysteries like Easter Island, Sasquatch, and the lost continent of Atlantis. I couldn't get enough of these intriguing subject matters!<br /><br />Although my interest in many of these types of mysteries has waned over the years, I found Sylvia Browne's new book Secrets & Mysteries of the World to be absolutely irresistible. This is one of those rare books that cross my desk which could be called a real page turner. I looked forward to reading about each phenomenon presented in this book-sometimes reading it during commercials when watching TV! I finished it in a weekend, and learned some amazing facts in the process.<br /><br />One of the most intriguing subjects in Secrets & Mysteries of the World is that of tulpas. According to Browne, a tulpa is an entity created by an act of imagination. She quotes an excerpt from the book Body, Mind, & Spirit: A Dictionary of New Age Ideas, People, Places and Terms by Eileen Campbell and J.H. Brennan. In the excerpt, an amazing incident is chronicled: a woman was so interested in the concept of tulpas that she set out to create one. Employing intense visualization and concentration, she \\"created\\" a benign little monk, similar to Friar Tuck. As time wore on, her vision grew in clarity and substance-a sort of self-induced hallucination. The fascinating part of this story, though, is that her companions-who were unaware of her mental experiment-began to ask about the \\"stranger\\" who had turned up at their camp. What began with imagination began to have objective reality.<br /><br />Sylvia discusses other examples of tulpa creation, including a group of Spiritualists in England (comprised of educated folk like a journalist, scientist, dentist, doctor and a businessman) who \\"created\\" a man named Edward Howard. One night, after almost a year and a half of constructing the full scope of Edward's life, the man-in the flesh-appeared to them! This story has been well-documented; in fact, Sylvia talked to a woman named Minnie Bridges, who was a student at the Spiritualist college that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle frequented, and she corroborated that she had also seen Edward. In fact, many area mediums were called upon to get rid of him.<br /><br />Interestingly, Sylvia considers the Loch Ness Monster, Sasquatch, and even \\"the devil\\" tulpas created by mass belief.<br /><br />Secrets & Mysteries of the World covers mysterious places, strange creatures, unexplained objects, mystic phenomena, and Christian controversies. Among these fascinating subjects, Sylvia discusses Shangri-La, Lemuria, Extraterrestrials, the fairy world, otherworldly maps and instruments, auras, black holes, the Holy Grail, and the lost years of Jesus.<br /><br />Although Sylvia relies heavily on psychic information gleaned from her spirit guide Francine, she backs up the psychic information with scientific studies and historical research. At the very least, we're offered though provoking theories to these unexplained mysteries-as well as why we're here on this Earth and why many things happen as they do. Sylvia also provides the names of books, researches, and scientific studies so one can do further research on their own-and make up their own mind what to believe.<br /><br />At 237 pages, Secrets & Mysteries of the World is absorbing and easy read. For those of you fascinated by phenomena like the pyramids, the Shroud of Turin, and the Ica stones, you'll be highly entertained-and given food for thought about the origin and existence of these mysteries.eries of the World is absorbing and easy read.

Like other card decks depicting animal spirits, the pack can be used to identify current important forces in your life or to gain self-understanding. You can use it to clarify problems or as a form of divination. Finally you can use it to help in your magical work.\\" - Mike Leslie<br /><br />In ancient times, many cultures relied on real and mythical animal spirits for guidance. Based on ancient Greek and Celtic oracles, as well as a Jungian and shamanic understanding of the elements, The Magical Menagerie: Personal Power Through Animal Energies is a unique animal-based system of divination that forms a bridge between ages past and the present.<br /><br />This 42-card deck, illustrated by Eric Hotz, features common animals such as bear, wren, cat, owl, wolf, otter, and salmon, as well as fantastical creatures like dragon, centaur, mermaid, satyr, unicorn, and chimera. Also incorporated in the system are elementals such as gnomes, undines, sylphs, and salamanders-as well as quintessence (the fifth element), and a fetch (a chaotic, artificial entity).<br /><br />Author Mike Leslie has created a 150 page companion book to the The Magical Menagerie deck, providing an overview of elements and how they relate to Jungian psychology, the four humors, astrology, and the four directions-plus how the elements interact with one another. For example, Earth with Air benefits from blending pragmatism with inventiveness, but only if the ideas generated are realistic. Water and fire are both expansive and visionary; however, the balance is delicate, with the passion of fire possibly at variance with the sensitivity of water.<br /><br />All of the beasts mentioned in The Magical Menagerie are based on psychological characteristics and personal qualities by virtue of their elemental correspondences. Thus, \\"knowing thyself\\" can yield even greater information when consulting this deck for guidance. These cards can also be consulted for insight on time frames: which time is best to perform magical work, to confront a difficult situation, or to begin a new project. Because the elements are dynamic, the process of change within time and space can be reflected in this system. For example, Fire is most energetic, but its duration is relatively short unless it has fuel to keep it going-thus it tends to convert to the slower qualities associated with Air. Water can likewise speed up or slow down to become Earth, the slowest and most enduring of the states. As a result, when a particular creature turns up, it can indicate salient times or directions of increasing specificity.<br /><br />The companion guide to The Magical Menagerie gives detailed explanation of each card, including upright and reversed meanings, direction, time, and pace of change. Several spreads are also explained with examples, including spreads of 1, 3, 4 and 5 cards. Two additional cards are included in the deck: The Menagerie Wheel, and The Wheel of the Elements. Also included in this boxed set is a white cardboard box for card storage (to embellish as you see fit) as well as black organdy bag.<br /><br />This is the first animal oracle I've ever consulted, and I was surprised to find it quite accurate. The elemental timing and pace brought a new dimension to my divination experience; I can definitely see how the subtlety of elemental movement can bring additional information to the querent. So often, oracles give you information on the what or even the when-but not so much the how. By utilizing the rhythm of the elements, additional information is gained which then helps in making informed choices.<br /><br />If you're interested in animal totems and oracles, as well as fantastical creatures, Jungian psychology, shamanism, and elemental work, this is a fine divination system that is sure to add an extra dimension to self-knowledge and magical work.<br /><br />(To see 6 images from this deck, visit the Reviews section at [...])	2005-01-18

In her newest book Pendulums And The Light - Communication With The Goddess, the author explains how to attain a high rate of accuracy in using pendulums. If pendulums have proved frustrating to you, a wealth of remedies are provided for optimizing your dowsing experience. Maintaining that pendulums work via a fragile system of thought, neuromusculature, and partnership with a Light Being, Stein stressed the importance of a still and focused mind--which is greatly enhanced by meditation.<br /><br />Keeping the pendulum energetically cleared (and making sure it's cleared), dedicating it to a Light Being, practicing mental focus, learning how to discern \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" responses, and dowsing in quietude are some of the ways to get the most out of your pendulum experience. Stein gives detailed information on each of these recommendations and also provides a thorough troubleshooting section--addressing 25 different reasons why a pendulum may not work. In fact, she believes observing and applying the information in Pendulums And The Light will result in 95% accuracy with your pendulum for most types of requests, even psychic readings. When asking about the future--something quite tricky with pendulums--she estimates 75% accuracy after employing her suggestions.<br /><br />Pendulums can be as simple as a button on a string, and Stein dedicates an entire chapter on making and buying pendulums--including what materials make the best conductors of energy. There are also chapters on cleansing your pendulum, dedication to the Light, how to ask questions, using charts, healing, and more.<br /><br />This book provides practical guidance on getting the most out of your pendulum. Stein's sage advice has helped me figure out some of my own difficulties with pendulum use (including trying to dowse with a 6 year old running around!). There is extensive, immediately useful information in this book.<br /><br />However, there are a few minor irritations that I have with this book.<br /><br />The full title of this book is Pendulums And The Light - Communication With The Goddess. Stein does mention working with the goddess that has \\"joined\\" with her--Brede--but there is little explanation for some of her statements. For example, according to Stein, goddesses are just now arriving on Earth (?!), and if you connect with 38 or more DNA strands, a god or goddess will join with you as Brede has done with her. She also describes how Brede loves chocolate and loves to shop. One time, Stein walked out of a store with over $40 worth of candles--all because Brede requested them.<br /><br />Now, I don't actively work with particular goddesses, and I don't mean to offend anyone who does, but the whole idea seemed bizarre to me...especially as Stein goes on and on about Brede. Rather than a goddess, she appears (in print) as a parasite or even a dependent child. I'd much rather have heard about the different goddess energies out there, why Stein believes many aren't here now, and what exactly she believes that goddesses are, how to find one that best matches your personality and purposes, etc. Stein mentions, quite a few times, that further information can be found in her other books, but it seems to me that this book would just have been better off without the extra information about Brede.<br /><br />Also--and this criticism isn't just about Stein's book--I get the impression that many pendulists use a pendulum for everything. Want to know which book to buy at the store? Use a pendulum. Want to determine which cucumber to buy at the store? (one of the examples used in the book!)...use a pendulum. Want to determine what time the plumber is coming? Use a pendulum. I can't help but have thoughts like \\"Good grief, why can't you people just use your brain and realize some things don't have to be known...that there are more important things in life than which tangerine to pick in the produce aisle!\\" I also can't figure out why someone would go to such great lengths to use a tempermental tool when they could just develop their 6th sense (like clairvoyance, for example).<br /><br />Also, Stein speaks of the \\"Lords of Karma\\", Mother Nada, the Divine Director, and a whole host of players in a spiritual hierarchy. I couldn't help but think \\"OK, so why is this information in this book?\\" (especially if it's in her other books). I also couldn't help but be confused by the sci-fi-like creatures, the mention of different levels like solar system, galactic, and cosmic--and how to clear karma from these levels. For those who haven't read any of Stein's previous books, this information seems confusing and unnecessary to the subject matter.<br /><br />Those familiar with Stein's work--and those who have an interest in her Essential Energy Balance techniques--will no doubt love this book. And besides those few niggling irritations I mentioned, I have to say that this is the best book I've come across so far for teaching an individual how to select and use a pendulum. The troubleshooting guide is unsurpassed, and will likely empower and encouraged those who have previously been frustrated with pendulum use.coming? Use a pendulum.

Only the time you take it is voluntary. Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. It means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time. The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love's presence, which is your natural inheritance.\\" -- From the Introduction to A Course In Miracles<br /><br />In the mid-70's, two Professors of Medical Psychology at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons came together for a shared purpose. Frustrated by aggressive and angry feelings, they concluded \\"there must be another way\\". Helen Shucman and William Thetford then began the journey which resulted in A Course In Miracles. Helen began writing down her highly symbolic dreams at Bill's suggestion. When she wrote down the description of the dreams, she was surprised to have written down this is a course in miracles. A Voice, believed to be that of Jesus, began to speak to her in a rapid, inner dictation which she took down in a shorthand notebook. It wasn't \\"automatic writing\\"; rather, she could walk away and do other tasks, and then resume taking dictation at a later time. Although it made her uncomforable at first, it neve occurred to her to stop.<br /><br />In June of 1976, three volumes of A Course in Miracles were published, which included the 669-page Text, the 488-page Workbook For Students, and the 92-page Manual for Teachers. At present, all three volumes are included in one book.<br /><br />The Miracle Distribution Center has recently released Wisdom From A Course In Miracles, which is a box containing over 200 quotes from A Course In Miracles. Each card measures 2 1/2 by 3 3/4 inches and is printed on lovely, lavender card stock. Each quotation is referenced by page numbers from both the first and second editions, respectively, of ACIM. \\"T\\"=Text, \\"W\\"=Workbook For Students, and \\"M\\"=Manual For Teachers.<br /><br />You can pick a card a day to meditate upon, regardless of whether you are a student of the Course or not. You could also tuck a card into a letter to a friend, place them in a prominent place such as the refrigerator or a mirror, or select one at random when you need inspiration and guidance.<br /><br />Here is a sampling of some of the quotes from Wisdom From A Course In Miracles:<br /><br />In this world you can become a spotless mirror, in which the holiness of your Creator shines forth from you to all around you. You can reflect Heaven here. (T271/292)<br /><br />Miracles are natural. When they do not occur, something has gone wrong. (T1/3)<br /><br />Peace is a natural heritage of spirit. Everyone is free to refuse to accept his inheritance, but he is not free to establish what his inheritance is. (T44/49)<br /><br />The presence of fear is a sure sign that you are trusting in your own strength. (W77/77)<br /><br />It is not up to you to change your brother, but merely to accept him as he is...Any attempt you make to correct a brother means that you believe correction by you is possible, and this can only be the arrogance of the ego. (T156/167-168)<br /><br />The Holy Spirit's Voice is a loud as your willingness to listen.

If you loved fairy tales as a child and now need to know the truth about what is going on in your life and how to best deal with it, then you have come to the right place-the enchanted world of The Truth Fairy.\\" -Monte Farber and Amy Zerner<br /><br />Monte Farber and Amy Zerner are two of the world's foremost designers of interactive personal guidance systems, with over one million copies of their work in print. These legendary lovebirds, happily married since 1975, have added a new divination tool to their Enchanted World: The Truth Fairy Pendulum and Message Board Kit.<br /><br />Amy is an award-winning collage artist who has designed this kit, including the Truth Fairy pendulum necklace and the twelve Magical Message boards. Monte's wisdom graces the pages, instructing and encouraging the reader on dowsing, intuition, Fairy Guides, and using the pendulum. Amy's beautiful collage art is featured on the twelve message boards, each dedicated to a particular Fairy and realm of inquiry. When you have a question, simply select the Magical Message board of the Fairy whose truth you feel is most appropriate for addressing your inquiry, and then that Fairy will guide your pendulum to the correct answer. The twelve Fairies are:<br /><br />The Abundance Fairy - For questions about manifesting your hopes and wishes<br />The Enlightenment Fairy - For questions about increasing your spiritual awareness<br />The Banishing Fairy - For questions about letting go of toxic thoughts and habits<br />The Location Fairy - For finding something dear to you or where you should go<br />The Timing Fairy - For picking the best time for any action<br />The Joy Fairy - For lifting your spirits and helping you relax<br />The Success Fairy - For guidance on prioritizing the steps on your path<br />The Communication Fairy - For improving communications and self-expression<br />The Love Fairy - For questions about understanding and improving a loving relationship<br />The Courage Fairy - For using your strengths to overcome your fears<br />The Wellness Fairy - For questions about making the most of your health and vitality<br />The Creativity Fairy - For questions about focusing your talents in the best way.<br /><br />The Pendulum Necklace is on a 19 inch black cord, and has a lobster clasp. The pendulum itself is very unique: silver in color, each side features an engraving of a Fairy. Approximately 2.5 inches in length, the pendulum has an intriguing element: a flip top lid which reveals a secret compartment! When asking about vitamins or herbs, for example, you can put an actual pill in the compartment when dowsing. Or, you can write your question on a slip of paper and slip it into the compartment before inquiring the Truth Fairy. Because the pendulum is on a necklace, you can take it with you wherever you go to use with, or without, the Magical Message boards.<br /><br />The Magical Message boards come in a rainbow of pastel colors, with Amy's gorgeous collage in the center. Each board features four axes to discern the swing of the pendulum: Yes, No, Maybe, and Don't Know. In the corner of each board are four words, which provide another way of dowsing: point a finger on each word with one hand, and then dowse the answer with the pendulum. For example, if you wanted to inquire the Abundance Fairy, you could point to the words Invest, Save, Trade, or Change, ask your question, and then pay attention to which axis the pendulum swings (Yes, No, Maybe, or Don't Know). Or, if you were talking to the Location Fairy, you could point to the words North, South, East, or West. On the back of each board are five suggested questions to help you construct your question.<br /><br />Also included in the The Truth Fairy Pendulum and Message Board Kit is a 48-page book which gives step-by-step instruction on how to use this kit to obtain answers to your questions-including how to phrase a question for optimal clarity-as well as how to use the common sense of the left brain in conjunction with the imagination and intuition of the right. Each Fairy has its own \\"bio\\", not to mention a special enchantment to help you summon a particular Truth Fairy.<br /><br />Amy Zerner and Monte Farber's newest offering to the world is an excellent introduction to both the Fairy world and pendulums. I admit, I have had difficulty using pendulums in the past (much like Monte!), so I didn't know if this kit would work for me. However, as I read the Guidebook, I felt a spark of anticipation and connection-as if the Fairies were ready and willing to work with me to (finally!) be confident with pendulum use. I asked questions of the Timing Fairy and the Wellness Fairy. With the former, I kept getting \\"No\\" answers. I was a little disappointed at the repeat answer, wondering if this would be yet another pendulum \\"failure\\". However, when I asked several questions of the Wellness Fairy, I received specific-and varied-answers that confirmed what I had been feeling, and provided comfort that I was, indeed, on the right track. Not only that, the pendulum swung very robustly with some questions, but faintly on others-indicating, to me, the strength of the guidance itself (and how much I needed it!), as well as its importance to my questions.<br /><br />I highly recommend this easy-to-use kit that will help you access your intuition, hone your discernment, and link you to the magical realm of Nature's (and your) cheerleaders-the Fairies.our questions-including how to phrase a question for optimal clarity-as well as how to use the common sense of the left brain in conjunction with the imagination and intuition of the right.

Some scoff at the notion that \\"love is the answer\\", but Williamson answers them by saying: \\"It's amazing how much ridicule the topic of love can attract when it does anything other than support the status quo.\\" Make no mistake: Williamson does not advocate what I call \\"sloppy agape\\". Rather, she boldly challenges humanity to start getting with the Divine program and begin to change from the inside out.<br /><br />In her new book The Gift Of Change - Spiritual Guidance For A Radically New Life , Williamson sounds a clarion call that now is the time to begin to look within for change. Attempting to change the external world, she asserts, is akin to trying to change a movie by altering the screen when dealing with the projector is what's needed. Saying \\"hidden beliefs are dangerous beliefs\\", the reader is challenged to examine personal beliefs and the attitudes they engender. Tracing defensiveness--a form of \\"passive violence\\"--to the root of war, Williamson demonstrates how our resistance to love and vulnerability keep us enslaved to the ego. She writes:<br /><br />\\"Whenever our outer world remains stuck, it is incumbent upon us to look, not outward, but inward. It is a call to find the places in ourselves where we are holding on to old ways--places where we blame others rather than taking personal responsibility for our woes; where we judge others instead of blessing them; where we are hard rather than vulnerable and open and kind. These issues hold the hidden keys to unlocking our unsolved personal mysteries.\\"<br /><br />Williamson outlines ten bridges of transformation that can be crossed when we fix our eyes and hearts on that which is unchanging--an eternal compass of spiritual principles which can guide us on the personal and global path to wholeness:<br /><br />*From Forgetting Who We Are to Remembering Who We Are<br />*From Negative Thinking to Positive Love<br />*From Anxiety to Atonement<br />*From Asking God to Change the World to Praying That He Changes Us<br />*From Living in the Past and Future to Living in the Present<br />*From Focus on Guilt to Focus on Innocence<br />*From Separation to Relationship<br />*From Spiritual Death to Rebirth<br />*From Your Plan to God's Plan<br />*From Who We Were to Who We Are Becoming<br /><br />Using personal anecdotes, Williamson delves into various life transitions such as menopause, adolescence, and parenting--and how seasons of change are amazing opportunities for not only growth and change, but also global transformation. Saying that \\"our greatest contribution to the world at this time is not just what we do but who we are becoming\\", she shows the reader that no matter where we find ourselves, we can be a conduit for miracles. In fact, she says that sometimes \\"being about our Father's business\\" is as much what we're not doing, than what we are. That is, chasing a future dream of spiritual ambition, we ignore life in the Present--which is the only place that \\"I Am\\", and miracles, dwell:<br /><br />\\"If I had simply allowed myself to enjoy my life more, I would have ended up better off later on. And when I allow myself to simply enjoy my life right now, I'm giving myself the biggest boost for the future. Every point in life's journey is inherently preparing us for our future in ways the rational mind cannot possibly comprehend.\\"<br /><br />As an example, Williamson poignantly explains that she resisted some aspects of motherhood when her daughter was a baby--often distracting herself from the overwhelming insistent, needy demands of her daughter. Williamson recalls: \\"I see now that the fact it was happening meant it was exactly what I was supposed to be doing, and I wasn't losing out on anything by giving most of my attention to her.\\" As one who has had a similar experience with motherhood versus aspirations for a \\"real life\\" (i.e., a spiritually fulfilling vocation), I resonated with the truth that wherever we find ourselves, that is exactly where we need to be. Our limitless and brightness can shine no matter where we are at; in fact, when we shine, we can literally change the world--for all minds are joined in the Mind of Christ.<br /><br />The Gift Of Change provides us with a powerful blueprint on transforming our lives--and the world--through transforming our thoughts. Through the spiritual compass of the ten principles, we can at last find our way to inner peace and miracles--which results in a world that is healed and whole.<br /><br />If you're disheartened at the state of global affairs--including war--this book can show you how to replace thoughtforms of fear with those of love. If you're desperately searching for your soulmate or the perfect job, The Gift of Change lights the path to the miraculous Now. If you're experiencing existential angst--free-floating anxiety that doesn't seem to have a cause-- Williamson says you are not alone...but there is a way through it by choosing love over fear and trusting the Holy Spirit for a miracle.ctly what I was supposed to be doing, and I wasn't losing out on anything by giving most of my attention to her.\\" As one who has had a similar experience with motherhood versus aspirations for a \\"real life\\" (i.e., a spiritually fulfilling vocation), I resonated with the truth that wherever we find ourselves, that is exactly where we need to be.

The world is full of stories, but the stories are all one.\\" - The Five People You Meet In Heaven by Mitch Albom<br /><br />A critical, abusive, alcoholic father. The nightmares--and a physical wound--courtesy of war. Infertility. A beloved wife struck down with a neurological disease. Evaporating dreams of being an engineer, replaced with a life-long job as a theme park maintenance man.<br /><br />Eddie feels like a loser. He was a nobody-his alcoholic father made sure of that. Working at the theme park Ruby's Pier, like his father before him, is how Eddie died and went to heaven.<br /><br />Author Mitch Albom wrote the script for the made-for-TV movie The Five People You Meet In Heaven, which is based on his bestselling book. The theme of this story is that no life is a waste, no matter how seemingly insignificant-and that there are no random acts, because all are connected.<br /><br />The profound but simple truths in this poignant story by Albom reflect the New Age themes that all is one, there are no random acts, and that peace, learning and growth face us on the Other Side.<br /><br />On a sunny day at Ruby's Pier, a cable system breaks down on an amusement ride, and Eddie, played by Jon Voight, tries to save a girl from death. He feels small hands in his as he tries to pull her to safety.<br /><br />\\"When Eddie died, he felt no pain. He experienced calm-as if every pain he experienced on Earth was washed away.\\"<br /><br />In heaven, Eddie is first met by a man who used to be a part of Ruby Pier's freak show-a man tinted blue by a chemical tincture he drank as a child (played by Jeff Daniels). The man of blue tells Eddie that he will meet five people in heaven, and each will share things which will be a lesson for Eddie. The part that the Blue Man played in Eddie's life was unknown until Eddie arrives in heaven: as a small boy, Eddie was playing ball in the street, and the Blue Man, driving down the same street, swerved to miss him. The Blue Man ended up dying of a heart attack, and Eddie was unaware of his part in the story.<br /><br />When the Blue Man shared what happen, Eddie felt badly-that the accident wasn't fair, and that it should have been him that died. The blue man replies: \\"There is no fair in life and death. If it were, no good men would die young.\\" Eddie assumes that he will now pay for his \\"sin\\" and be judged. The Blue Man dismisses this idea, almost with amusement: \\"No, no, no.\\", he says, shaking his head. In heaven, there is no judgment, but rather an opportunity to examine our lives-who we touched, the choices we made, and the consequences of those choices.<br /><br />Eddie is then visited by four more people, in their own unique heaven. Forgiveness is another theme of the story, and the character of Ruby tells Eddie: \\"Hatred is a curved blade. The harm we do to others, is harm we do to ourselves...no one is born with anger. It builds up over time, with the things we don't say and the things we bury. When we die, the soul is freed of it-free to see the truth.\\"<br /><br />The process that Eddie goes through when he dies is consistent with the case studies featured in the books Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls by hypnotherapist Dr. Michael Newton. No angry God awaits us at the gates of death, but instead, we are met with kind, loving guides and souls-eventually being ushered into a personally designed `curriculum' for our soul's growth and edification. When Eddie meets his former military captain in his personal heaven the captain says to him: \\"Time isn't what you think it is, kid. Neither is dying.\\" Also consistent with between-life regression case histories is the ability for souls to change shape (like Eddie's wife did when he asked her to become \\"old\\" again), as well as the ability to \\"choose\\" your heaven.<br /><br />The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a story of redemption and personal meaning, as Eddie finally realizes that everything- even difficulties, disappointments, and deaths-happen for a reason. We're also reminded that \\"all endings are beginnings. We just don't know it at the time...\\"<br /><br />Throughout the story, Eddie calls himself a loser, feeling that he did not accomplish anything with his life (like going to engineering school as he planned). He felt alone, and without anything to show for his life. However, at the end of meeting the five people from his life on the Other Side, Eddie is shown the results of his everyday, \\"mundane\\" work as an amusement park maintenance man: a sea of people of every age, race, and walk of life that were kept safe over the years by his diligence:<br /><br />\\"All the accidents he prevented, all the people he kept safe-their children, and their children's children-are because of the things he did day after day.\\"<br /><br />The human search for a sense of meaning and purpose to life is a deep one. Perhaps the first thoughts of the first human were \\"Who am I? Why am I here?\\" We're still asking these questions--and desperately looking for the answer.<br /><br />Living in an increasingly complex and stressful era, it's tempting to think that the mundane is meaningless and that life is a random crapshoot. I was deeply moved by this story, reminded that no interpersonal interaction is by chance, and that every cruel, painful, or disappointing situation serves a higher purpose that will someday be explained. The Five People You Meet In Heaven by Mitch Albom shows that, truly, no life is a \\"waste\\", and no life is insignificant.

Courage is a fundamental part to becoming intuitive-that is, taking action based on the guidance that's received. In fact, Myss says that the intuitive journey is actually the journey to self-esteem.<br /><br />Intuitive Power - Your Natural Resource is a live Caroline Myss workshop on 4 CD's. The theme of this workshop is the role of intuition, the nature of intuitive blocks, the importance of personal power and self-esteem in hearing and following intuitive guidance, and the interior spiritual life.<br /><br />CD 1<br /><br />In CD 1, Myss discusses intuition \\"American style\\" which includes the myth that we deserved to have our life \\"settled\\"-that the Mystery of who we are is something to be \\"solved\\" rather than lived. She also discusses the propensity of many American spiritual seekers to elevate roles like \\"healers\\", believing they are of utmost importance to the Divine-and how they sneer at \\"blue collar intuition\\" and grounded occupations (like accountant, for example) believing they're \\"just jobs\\" that don't require intuition. She goes on to dispel the myth that intuitive skill and the spiritual life are one in the same, as well as the idea that intuition is a \\"gift\\"-only bestowed on those who are \\"good\\" or \\"light enough candles\\".  Survival intuition, that of the first three chakras, is *not* spiritual guidance or higher revelation; in fact, this type of intuition has a private agenda built into it.<br /><br />CD 2<br /><br />Funny stories are peppered throughout this workshop, and Myss begins Disc 2 telling the story of a Puella Eternis who was in her 30's and still lived with her Dad. Myss was discussing how God can \\"wipe you out\\" in an instant-with or without a prayer of surrender-and mentioned that as she was teaching this concept at another workshop, especially as it related to finances, this Puella called out \\"God can't take my money because my Dad put it in a Trust Fund.\\"  The audience roars with laughter at this story. Myss also goes on to admit that she has changed positions of a lot of things as she read and learned more, including the concept that illness is caused by negativity. Stating that she \\"doesn't buy it anymore\\" and that it's a \\"cruel thought\\", she acknowledges that while negativity can enhance illness, it doesn't cause it. Myss also says that she will teach, until the day she disincarnates, that the great skill or power in the human experience is not love, but self-esteem.<br /><br />CD 3<br /><br />Myss explains how our physical body is the \\"caboose\\" on the intuitive train-it is not the engine. She explains how we are always doing \\"energetic readings\\" by scanning people-an unconscious process that lights up all 7 of the chakras. As she has taught in other workshops, Myss talks about how meeting new people is often an exercise in gathering energetic data-starting with 1st chakra questions like \\"Where are you from?\\", and working upwards to the other chakras. For example, a 2nd chakra question would be \\"Are you married? Do you have any kids?\\" Unfortunately, as often happens in her workshops, Myss doesn't go beyond the first three chakras so we can see how questions from the upper chakras would be posed to others, and what exactly we're assessing from chakras 4-7.<br /><br />Myss explains why some people and situations \\"gut\\" us, how to call our power back and how to keep energetically \\"contained\\"-which is the object of health. She goes on to tell a story about reaming out a guy when she was on safari in South Africa, despite \\"knowing better\\". She begins taking questions from audience members and someone asks Myss if she felt it was her place to do so. \\"No, I wanted it to be my place\\", she answers.<br /><br />CD 4<br /><br />Myss continues to take questions from the audience about her safari experience. She is asked: \\"Is it better to do that (chew someone out) then hold it in?\\" She answers: \\"You know, what I did is never the better path. He didn't come there to be attacked by me.\\" Myss admonishes the audience on the importance of being hard-core honest with themselves and ask \\"What is the real reason I want to do what I'm about to do? What's the real reason I want to say _____?\\"  Myss also talks about the back-lash of the new age, saying we've become \\"hyper-responsible\\" about illness and the concept of creating your own reality. She argues that we influence our reality, but we don't create it.<br /><br />She is then asked about archetypes and if they are actual entities. She replies that they are, in fact, actual entities and that a person can be \\"possessed\\" by an archetype by identifying so strongly with an archetypal patterns that the pattern becomes more real than they are. According to Myss, comments like \\"That's just the way I am\\" are important clues to your archetypal patterns, and she correlates Julie Andrews' real life nun archetype and Andrew's role in The Sound of Music.<br /><br />In Conclusion<br /><br />Myss spends a good amount of time hitting home the importance of self-esteem and the containment of our personal power in this audio workshop. I have the Myss CD workshop series on Self Esteem, but haven't listened to it yet, so I don't know how much of this information from this series is covered in that workshop.

And, because humans are 70% water, this knowledge translates to the elevation of human consciousness?<br /><br />According to Japanese researcher Masaru Emoto, the answer is a resounding yes. Emoto's pioneering research on the effects of thought, words, and music on water has come to the forefront since his photo of waters crystals have been featured in the popular indie movie What The Bleep Do We Know. Many of these photos, as well as the foundations of his research, are featured in Emoto's fascinating book The Hidden Messages In Water.<br /><br />According to the healing principle of homeopathy, like cures like. So to cure lead poisoning, a minute amount of lead would be included in water to \\"cancel out\\" this poisoning. The interesting thing, however, is that despite all traces of lead being removed from the water--entirely undetected by physical means--healing would still occur. Emoto realized that water \\"memorizes\\" substances and essentially copies the information. This realization changed his life.<br /><br />Emoto began to wonder: Is it possible to find physical evidence of the ability of water to memorize information? Might there be some way of seeing it with the physical eye? In The Hidden Messages in Water, Emoto enthusiasm is palpable as he shares his discovery of how to freeze water crystals and photograph them. Since no two snow crystals are alike, he concluded, then perhaps he could capture the \\"memory\\" of water on film.<br /><br />The results astounded him, and are now astounding the world. Emoto exposed water to music like Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony and Mozart's 40th Symphony and the results were well-formed crystals that were delicate, beautiful, elegant, and distinct in characteristic. In contrast, when he exposed water to violent heavy metal music, this resulted in fragmented and deformed crystals.<br /><br />But the experimentation didn't stop with water. Emoto thought about what would happen if phrases were written on pieces of paper and then wrapped around bottles of water with the words facing in--words such as \\"Thank you\\" and \\"Fool\\". It didn't seem logical for water to \\"read\\" the writing, understand the meaning, and change its form accordingly. Yet, he already knew from his experimentation with music that strange things could happen.<br /><br />The results of the experiment, as well as the implication, were staggering. Water exposed to \\"Thank you\\" formed beautiful hexagonal crystals, but water exposed to the word \\"Fool\\" produced fragmented, malformed crystals. Further experimentation showed that water exposed to positive expressions like \\"Let's do it!\\" created attractive, well-formed crystals, but water exposed to negative expressions like \\"Do it!\\" barely formed any crystals at all.<br /><br />The lesson from these experiments is that words have power; positive words affect the word accordingly, as does the vibration of negative words and their power to destroy. Because humans are 70% water, how much more do words affect us as humans...as well as the planet which is mostly water?<br /><br />There are 32 color pages in The Hidden Messages in Water, featuring dozens of photographs of water crystals subjected to different songs, words, and stimuli. For example, Elvis Presley's Heartbreak Hotel showed a crystal divided into two parts, almost as if mimicking the song. Appliances that emit electromagnetic frequency, like computers, microwaves, and television, produced incomplete crystals. However, when the same water was subjected to the words love and gratitude, complete crystals were formed--as if those words \\"healed\\" the water.<br /><br />Through his research, Emoto has found that the phrase love and gratitude produces the most beautiful crystal. While \\"love\\" and \\"gratitude\\" form beautiful crystals separately, the word gratitude seems to be doubly powerful. Water is H2O, and Emoto surmises that it's gratitude that's been missing in the human equation. He goes so far to say: \\"Love and gratitude\\" are the words that must serve as the guide for the world....We msut begin by learning what it means to have enough...If you open your eyes, you will see that the world is full of so much that deserves your gratitude.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the most compelling story in this book, at least for me, was when a family experimented with rice. They put rice in three jars, and every day for a month, they said \\"Thank you\\" to the first jar, \\"You fool\\" to the second jar, and completely ignored the third jar. After a month, the rice that was told \\"Thank you\\" started to ferment, with a mellow smell like that of malt. The second jar that was exposed to the words \\"You fool\\" rotted and turned black. Interestingly, though, the jar that was ignored rotted before the rice that was exposed to \\"You fool\\". According to Emoto:<br /><br />\\"It seems that being ridiculed is actually not as damaging as being ignored. To give your positive or negative attention to something is a way of giving energy. The most damaging form of behavior is withholding your attention.\\"<br /><br />Emoto's wonderment and excitement is so evident in this book. I was captivated by his first-hand stories such as the one where 350 people gathered around a clouded lake in Japan to pray for world peace--and how the clouded water began to clear up in front of their eyes. I was also intrigued as Emoto discussed the research of other scientists such as Dr. Sheldrake, who has done pioneering studies on morphic fields and morphic resonance and how this theory explains synchronicity, group consciousness (collective memory), archetypal patterns, and even the similarities among the features of family members.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Hidden Messages In Water. Emoto's compelling research speaks a crystal-clear message that has long been taught by sages and mystics: our thoughts and words are powerful, one person can change the world, and love and gratitude is the cure for a polluted consciousness.man equation.

In relation to your luminous side, you will discover the power, gifts, and unknown resources that you possess to help you through this magical journey that is your life. As for your shadows, the Toltec Oracle will be the mirror wherein you will be able to see the disowned parts of yourself that you need to acknowledge and reintegrate. This will enable you to grow into a more whole human being--able to accomplish what is meant for you to accomplish in your life.\\" --Victor Sanchez<br /><br />The Toltec were the highest culture developed in Mesoamerica who developed a body of shamanic practices to enhance states of awareness, connect with the sacred, and see the deeper sense of existence. The tradition of the Toltec still endures today, and author Victor Sanchez has encapsulated this ancient wisdom in The Toltec Oracle, a 33-card deck featuring colorful artwork from original 16th-century Toltec codices.<br /><br />In Toltec spirituality, there is only one God that manifests itself through multiple natural forces which are also called Poderios; The Creator is known as Senteotl. So while many deities are mentioned within this tradition, they are symbols that reflect how things work in the Universe--guides to understanding the sacred arrangement that the Great Spirit made of the world so we can live in harmony with this arrangement. The Toltec had a strong orientation to pragmatism, and thus were not drawn to abstract speculations about God. In fact, the Toltec were proponents of movement and action, creating spiritual practices that woould being sense, joy, and efficiency to their actions in the world.<br /><br />The Toltec Oracle reflects the concept of sacred duality, and shows us that embracing the vision of complementary opposites could provide a means for us to evolve into a superior way of coexisting in human society. This approach was called kinam, which means the power that arises from harmonizing opposites. The two sides of duality is the \\"Tonal\\" and the \\"Nagual\\". The Tonal represents the reality we can see with ordinary perception and that we can rationalize. The Nagual, or Nahualli, represents the mystery, magic, and silent knowledge.<br /><br />According to Sanchez, the realization of our dual nature with a Tonal and Nagual side is key for our individual process of evolution. Most of the imbalance we suffer in life is mismanagement of one of these two sides. He likens the imbalance of having one without the other to having two legs but walking with one.<br /><br />Sanchez maintains that the primary function for an oracle is not to serve as a divination tool, but as a window to the governing principles of life and as a mirror for the soul. Indeed, the The Toltec Oracle is not a simple question and answer device, but an authentic path for self-development. Thus, consulting this particular oracle may require an investment of time, especially for the Mirror of Life Spread, as well as taking appropriate action based on the information you receive.<br /><br />There are two sets of cards in The Toltec Oracle: the Tonalpohualli Cards and the Ruler Cards. The Tonalpohualli Cards coincide with the twenty day signs of the Toltec Calendar, and reflect the archetypal life situations we experience. The Ruler Cards, however, represent the thirteen most important deities of Toltec spiritual lore. These deities represent the highest governing spiritual principles of life.<br /><br />This box set comes with a glossy, color-coded layout of the Cross of Ketsalkoatl, a Toltec model used by the Toltec for mathematical calculations, oracle readings, and healing procedures, among other uses. Instructions are given on how to do one and two card readings, as well as the more comprehensive Mirror of Life Spread. For the latter spread, four cards are chosen from the Tonalpohualli Cards to go into the four quadrants, and one card is chosen from the Ruler Cards to go in the center. Sancehz gives you the background and general meaning of each card. In addition, there is a comprehensive explanation of the card position for each of the four quadrants--for example, if 19 Kiawitl-Rain were to fall in the Body Quadrant--as well as the meaning of the Ruler Card in the center which influences the entire reading. Each placement features suggested questions and activities which are designed for you to examine and probe the deeper meaning of the situation you're asking about in light of the card placements and their accompanying wisdom. In fact, there are more than 200 exercises and practices with practical applications for the readings accompany the cards.<br /><br />Also included is a 274 page book that provides the foundation of Toltec spirituality, and how this way of life applies to the oracle itself. You're encouraged to take your time with this oracle--to sit with the selected cards, meditating on the placements as you would a mandala--and to take notes of your impressions, as well as your answers to the questions Sanchez poses.<br /><br />I thought this oracle would be difficult to use, especially with all the words in the Nauatl language. However, Sanchez is a very lucid writer who is obviously used to \\"breaking it down\\" in order to teach others. I did a comprehensive Mirror of Life Spread and journaled the results. I still need to sit with some of the information that The Toltec Oracle provided (or rather, I probably need to take action!), but I found the results to be amazingly accurate and quite challenging. This oracle is certainly not a \\"feel good\\" oracle, because both \\"the light\\" and \\"the dark\\" will be exposed for your consideration. Sometimes, we don't want to \\"own\\" those disowned parts of ourselves, and since the crux of Toltec spirituality is movement and change, challenge, as well as encouragement to reach higher, is a side effect of this powerful oracle.<br /><br />(To see 6 images from this deck, visit the Reviews section at [...])of each card.

A leading activist and teacher in building common ground between religions, Brother Teasdale passed to the other side in October 2004--before he had a chance to see the publishing of his new book The Mystic Hours.<br /><br />Teasdale believes that we are all mystics, and that books and reading can often serve as a direct path to mystical realization. Drawing upon wisdom from all the great religions, as well as insights from contemporary authors and mystics, The Mystic Hours - A Daybook of Interspiritual Wisdom & Devotion is an interspiritual devotional for every day of the year. Organized into 365 pages, Teasdale takes a brief wisdom quote and then provides illuminating commentary on its meaning and relevance. The devotionals are at once gentle and incisive, designed for meditation and reflection.<br /><br />Here's an example of one of the interspiritual devotionals from the book:<br /><br />I don't think that any great issues ever get resolved. Rather, I think we outgrow them. --Jean Houston<br /><br />\\"The great matters that divide us, most ironically the world's terrible conflicts over religion, are usually irreconcilable as long as the combatants are so heavily invested in their position. One example of this kind of polarization is the terrible conflict in Northern Ireland between Catholics and Protestants. Neither side of this conflict will likely ever understand the other side's position as long as they cling to the very real injustices they have suffered. Eventually, the two sides will tire of death and hatred and will abandon the old rivalry. That we may outgrow our need for dualism and conflict--that is my prayer.\\"<br /><br />And another example:<br /><br />A vital faith is more like an organism or a work of art than it is like a cafeteria tray. --Huston Smith<br /><br />\\"Although he is a great proponent of synthesis in the study of religion, Huston Smith, the venerable sage of the religious and spiritual life as well as comparative religion, corroborates D.H.

Do you wonder what is going to happen to you after your die? Is it possible you have a spirit which came from somewhere else and will return there after your body dies, or is this just wishful thinking because you are afraid?\\" --Dr. Michael Newton in Journey of Souls - Case Studies of Life Between Lives<br /><br />At one time or another, everyone wonders what happens to them when they die, and what lies beyond the grave. In his book Journey of Souls - Case Studies of Life Between Lives, Hypnotherapist Dr. Michael Newton chronicles the experiences of 29 people that were under deep hypnosis and their experiences between lives. Many books have been written about past lives, but this book addresses what happens between lives.<br /><br />Dr. Newton did not set out to regress people beyond their current earthly lives. In fact, as a skeptic by nature and one oriented towards traditional therapy, he resisted requests to do past-life regression--feeling that this was unorthodox and unethical. However, one of his clients complained of a lifetime of chronic pain on his right side, and during one of their regular sessions, the client made stabbing motions to describe the kind of pain he felt. When searching for an explanation for this client's choice of images, he uncovered that his client had a past life as a WWI solider that was killed by a bayonet in France. Through this discovery, they were able to eliminate this pain altogether.<br /><br />He then began to do past life regressions, but then stumbled on a discovery of enormous proportions: he found that it was possible to see into the spirit world through the mind's eye of a hypnotized subject who could report back to him about life between lives.<br /><br />Dr. Newton explains:<br /><br />\\"The research was painfully slow, but as the body of my cases grew I finally had a working model of the eternal world where our souls live. I found thoughts about the spirit world involve universal truths among the souls of people living on Earth. It was these perceptions by so many different types of people which convinced me that their statements were believable. I am not a religious person, but I found the place where we go after death to be one of order and direction, and I have come to appreciate that there is a grand design to life and afterlife.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Newton shares actual dialogue culled from audio recordings of regression sessions between he and his clients about what happens at the gate of death, who meets us on the other side, what we do once we're there, the purpose of our life, the role of guides, the nature of karma, cluster \\"study groups\\", inter-soul communication, what happens to \\"disturbed\\" souls, aura colors, the different levels of souls, and much more.<br /><br />I found Journey of Souls utterly fascinating, as well as Dr. Newton's sequel Destiny of Souls. However, my experience with these books was much more than mere intellectual fascination: both my husband and I experienced an utter paradigm shift about the afterlife, the Creator, and the purpose of life. Up until reading these books, I was still on the fence about reincarnation, and my husband's perspective was \\"no way!\\" The compelling regression sessions chronicled in this book convinced us otherwise, largely because of the consensus among regressed clients and how their reports confirmed some spiritual notions we were discovering on our own through direct experience.<br /><br />No other model made sense to either one of us; we long concluded that there was no literal hell, but what of suffering on Earth? Are our bodies, and our lives, completely random and arbitrary? Is it really possible we live more than one life? Why are we born into the family we are, especially if it results in abuse or pain?<br /><br />In these books we discovered that individuals carefully choose his or her own body and life circumstances to bring about certain experiences and to draw the soul closer to the perfection of the Creator. The whole point of incarnating is for self development. Yet, no one is rushed back into incarnating, and every soul has a chance to enter a dimension of time/space to \\"try out\\" a life and decide if this is the best choice for their own path.<br /><br />On the other side, there is playfulness, exploration, role playing, lessons, growth, past life examination, and so on. It is a place of rest, healing, rejuvenation, and self-examination. There are \\"schools\\" and our learning is a part of a specialized soul group. We have guides who teach us how to work with energy, and others who open up \\"books of life\\" so we can scrutinize our past life performance--and decide where we messed up, and how we can best grow in future lives.<br /><br />A helpful aspect of this book is the explanation of why some individuals go through difficult relationships, especially as children:<br /><br />\\"When clients tell me how much they suffered from the actions of family members, my first question to their conscious mind is, 'If you had not been exposed to this person as a child, what would you now lack in understanding?'

And he would never consign the human race to endless suffering and unavoidable death. Union with God is possible, and its consequence is never-ending joy and the removal of death. God does not suffer and die; therefore, we don't need to suffer and die.\\" --Michael Berg in Becoming Like God - Kabbalah And Our Ultimate Destiny<br /><br />It seems that everywhere I turn anymore, I see the Kabbalah. Or Cabala. Or Qabalah. Or...well, you get my drift. A recent skit on Saturday Night Live featured a fake quote by Madonna where all she said was \\"Kabbalah, Kabbalah, Kabbalah\\"--a reference to the pop star's interest in this mystical off-shoot of Judaism. Her pilgrimage to Israel made the news, and People magazine recently featured a small piece on the party that she and Demi Moore threw in London for Kabbalistic Rabbi Michael Berg. Gwyneth Paltrow was in attendance, as were other luminaries like Guy Ritchie, Valentino, and Versace.<br /><br />What were they all celebrating at this posh party? The release of Berg's new book Becoming Like God - Kabbalah And Our Ultimate Destiny. Michael Berg is the director of The Kabbalah Centre, and has achieved the amazing feat of translating the 23 volume Zohar from the Aramaic into English--all by the age of 28. (He began the translation at age 18.) The Zohar is the foundation of the Kabbalah, and according to Kabbalistic teachers like Berg, is not a book of religion but of ancient technology--a technology so powerful that it can end death itself.<br /><br />I've tried to read books on the Kabbalah before, but I usually give up early in the game--bored to tears by Hebrew words that I don't understand and a Tree of Life that's never really explained in lucid terms. When I received a copy of Becoming Like God, I thought that perhaps this would be the facile version of this ancient mystical tradition that would finally hold some relevance.<br /><br />An easy-to-read book that's peppered with quotes in hot-pink, all-caps script--there is nary a mention of the Tree of Life, Kether, Malkuth, Binah, Chesed or any of the usual Kabbalistic buzz-words. One of the fuschia quotes in this book is FOCUS AND CLARITY ARE THE OPPONENT'S MORTAL ENEMIES. WE MUST FIGHT FOR CLARITY EVERY MOMENT: CLARITY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF CLARITY, CLARITY THAT WE'RE IN A PRISON, CLARITY THAT THERE'S A GOD FORMULA TO BE APPLIED, CLARITY THAT WE'RE DESTINED TO BE LIKE GOD. (Forgive me for cyber-shouting, but this is an example of how these quotes look in the book.)<br /><br />With all this talk about clarity...well, you'd think the book would be more clear. Instead, there is mention of an Opponent who's a \\"he\\"; I thought for sure he'd be unmasked as Satan himself at the end of the book, but instead, this nebulous Opponent's name is Why do you ask my name? (no lie)--as well as the desire to receive for self alone. What isn't explained is exactly what ego is within the context of the Zohar or the Kabbalah. Rather, Berg tries to convince us that we're all in a prison, that this Opponent is prison guard, that life must be a constant struggle of ruthlessness against this hated Opponent and that we must be ever-vigilant in the battle to become like God.<br /><br />There is much talk in Becoming Like God about evil versus good, deception versus truth, and life versus death. Some concepts I totally agree with and \\"get\\": that the illusion of separation causes needless suffering, that the ego is crafty and seeks to keep us isolated, that we were made in the image of God and are ever-evolving to realize our Divinity, etc.<br /><br />Yet, God is really never explained, either, and Berg portrays \\"Him\\" quite similarly to the typical male Patriarch of the Old Testament.

A winner of the Caldecott Medal, this book was released in 1985 and is the basis for the movie featuring Tom Hanks.<br /><br />The story begins with a little boy laying on his bed, straining to hear the ringing bells of Santa's sleigh. He relates that his friends insisted that there was no Santa, but he knew they were wrong. Instead of hearing ringing bells, though, the boy hears the hissing steam and squeaking metal of the Polar Express--a magical train filled with children that is bound for the North Pole.<br /><br />When the train arrives at the North Pole, the conductor tells the children that Santa will select one of them to receive the first gift of Christmas. The little boy happens to be the one that is chosen, and although he realizes that he could have any gift that he could imagine, he chooses one silver bell from Santa's sleigh.<br /><br />Although the silver bell made the most magical sound, like nothing the little boy or his sister has heard before, it becomes apparent that not everyone can hear it's beautiful ringing. In fact, when the boy rings it on Christmas morning, his parents thought it was broken because they don't hear a sound.<br /><br />The final paragraph in The Polar Express says:<br /><br />\\"At one time most of my friends could hear the bell, but as years passed, it fell silent for all of them. Even Sarah found one Christmas that she could no longer hear its sweet sound. Though I've grown old, the bell still rings for me as it does for all who truly believe.\\"<br /><br />I've been a fan of this book ever since I laid eyes on its enchanting illustrations over a decade ago. However, this book isn't just beautifully illustrated: it contains a magical tale that delights young and old alike (just ask my 6 year old son!)his book isn't just beautifully illustrated: it contains a magical tale that delights young and old alike (just ask my 6 year old son!) <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-08

Warmth and light are common to winter holidays like Yule, Christmas, Kwanzaa and Hanukkah, and all of humanity can join together in the spirit of peace, love and harmony at this special time of year.<br /><br />This book features holiday history and customs from around the world, traditions and symbolism, craft ideas and instructions, recipes, and much more. In the first chapter, the author discusses the history of Yule and other sun-welcoming traditions which then gave birth to many Christmas symbols and traditions<br /><br />Because Pagans also worshipped the sun, Christians set Jesus' birthday on December 25th, which was a Pagan celebration--and called the festival \\"Birth of the Son\\". Since \\"son\\" was pronounced the same as \\"sun\\", the Christians figured that the Pagans would assume this was just an addition to their own festivals. Note: Historians and theologians place Jesus' actual birth sometime in the Spring. Because Bethlehem's winters are brutal, shepherds would only be tending flocks at night during warmer months.<br /><br />Chapter 2 provides a fascinating glimpse into the origins of Christmas and Yuletide traditions and symbols, including elves, gifts exchanges, holly, mistletoe, reindeer, snowflakes, 12 days of Christmas, wassail, wreaths, and much more.<br /><br />Chapter 3 explains festivals of light from around the world, including Kwanzaa and Yule, and chapter 4 provides an interesting look into holiday customs from around the world--including Argentina, Australia, China, Denmark, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Pakistan, Scotland, and other countries. In Ireland, for example, a candle is put in the window on Christmas Eve to light the way of Mary and Joseph and other travelers who may wander by. Most Irish celebrations are on December 26th, St. Stephen's Day.<br /><br />Chapter 5 is about omens and superstitions associated with Christmas. For example, legend has it that animals can speak on Christmas Eve--but the same legend says it's unlucky to hear them!<br /><br />Chapter 6 is about Yuletide trivia and fun facts. Did you know that the reindeer Donner is really Donder, and means thunder? He was paired with Blitzen whose name means lightning. And where did we get the modern image of Santa Claus? From none other than the Coca-Cola company!<br /><br />Chapter 7 addresses making room for Yule, including cleaning rituals and success charms. Chapter 8 provides instructions for quick and easy Yule decorations, such as a Holiday Harmony Tree (made with small, thick magazines), Mistletoe Ball, placemats, and even Yuletide crafts for children. Easy-to-make sun catchers and a hand print wreath are but two of these easy and fun crafts for kids. Chapter 9 features other winter crafts such as creating a Winter Scene on a small table, and making bottled snowflakes.<br /><br />Chapter 10 is all about the Yule tree, including choosing a tree, a tree blessing ritual, how to make a tree skirt, and nine ornament ideas--including Swirled Ornaments and Cinnamon-Apple Ornaments. Chapter 11 is about making your own holiday cards, while Chapter 12 gives great holiday gift ideas. A few include Pine Cone Fire Starters, Bath Salts, Flower Pot Candle, Scented Mug Coasters, Dog Biscuits, Kitty Treats, Peanut Butter Bird Feeder Cakes, and Herbal Energy Sachets. Chapter 13 gives fun wrapping and name tag ideas.<br /><br />Chapter 14 is called Let's Party! and gives wonderful decorating ideas for the holiday table, while Chapter 15 provides party ideas and games. The author even includes a full-length holiday word search that can be photocopied for your guests or children!<br /><br />And what holiday gathering would be complete without food and drink? Chapter 16 gives dozens of recipes from Plum Pudding to Pecan Pralines, Hot Buttered Rum to Crockpot Wassail, and Spanish Turkey Soup to Reindeer Sandwiches. In Chapter 17, the author shares some of her own personal traditions which I found particularly fascinating since she's a Pagan and her husband is a Christian.<br /><br />Chapter 18 is a calendar for daily celebrations ideas for the holidays for the entire month of December. For example, the Japanese celebrate Hari No Kuyo (The Festival of Broken Needles) on this day to reclaim the feminine arts and enjoy them. Also included in this chapter are formalized Yule rituals. It was a treat to read about the various traditions and holidays on each of the 30 days--and it provides a great way to imbue the holidays with traditions that may be unfamiliar but share the common thread of love, joy, peace, and charity.<br /><br />Chapter 19 provides ideas on keeping the holidays happy, but the author is sensitive to the fact that sometimes depression creeps upon even the most positive of folks--and that it can be a very trying time for many. Chapter 20 gives practical after-holiday tips--including putting cranberry, sunflower, and acorn garland outside as a treat for the birds.<br /><br />Yule: A Celebration of Light and Warmth also contains four appendices: Appendix I is a list of the goddesses associated with Yule, Appendix II is a list of the gods associated with Yule, Appendix III is a list of holiday greetings from around the world (for example in Wales it's Nadolig Llawen and in Germany, it's Froehliche Weihnachten), and Appendix IV is a list of 15 Yule and Christmas-related websites.<br /><br />In Conclusion<br /><br />This is an information-packed book on Yule and other holiday celebrations of love, warmth, peace, and brotherhood that would be of great interest to history (and religious history) buffs, as well as those who love fresh craft and recipe ideas. The spells and enchantments may be off-putting to those who are traditional Christians, but there is much in this book aside from these references. Those who are Pagans, as well as those who celebrate the universal feelings of wonder, joy, peace, and hope that transcend race, religion, or geographic area, will find many great ideas and insights in this delightful holiday book.wn personal traditions which I found particularly fascinating since she's a Pagan and her husband is a Christian.

Animal guides are represented by animal forms, and provide information, guidance, and protection. Some people use the words animal totems and power animals interchangeably, but according to Dr. Steven Farmer in his new book Power Animals - How To Connect With Your Animal Spirit Guides, there is a subtle difference.<br /><br />Totem animals are usually asssociated with groups, such as a tribal totem, clan totem, or family totem. Even contemporary cultures have totem animals, such as those for sports teams (e.g. Toronto Blue Jays), or clubs and societies (such as the Lions Club).<br /><br />Power animals, however, are personal and specific. Like totem animals, they are guardian spirits who empower us. Yet, power animals have a unique and highly personal relationship with the individual, leading the way through non-ordinary reality. Power animals can be contacted through meditation, dreams, visions, and shamanic journeys. They can also appear in physical form, bearing an omen or message--depending on the context of the sighting, how often it appears, and how it is behaving.<br /><br />Power Animals describes the three realms of non-ordinary reality--and the plane where power animals reside--the four channels of spiritual perception, and how to honor your power animal. Farmer gives a summary of 36 different power animals, including a channeled message from each, qualities of the animal, what it means when a particular animal is your personal power animal, when to ask for this animal's help, and how to access it's power. He acknowledges that his summaries aren't exhaustive, and there are other power animals that exist--including imaginary ones like dragons and unicorns.<br /><br />Included with this book is a CD featuring guided meditations, with a run-time of 65:53. The first three featuring drumming with a particular rhythm, the fourth has a similar rhythm using a rattle, and the fifth offers a unique type of rhythm and sound using the didgeridoo and click sticks. The drumming and rattling are at the rate of 4 to 7 beats per second, which is the same rhythm that shamans use to induce a trance state in order to do their work.<br /><br />Track 1: Journey To Retrieve Your Power Animal<br />Track 2: Guided Meditation Journey For Divination<br />Track 3: Self-Directed Shamanic Journey With Drum<br />Track 4: Self-Directed Shamanic Journey With Rattle<br />Track 5: Self-Directed Shamanic Journey With Didgeridoo<br /><br />Personally, there are several birds and animals that I've identified with over the years--animals that gave me great wisdom. However, I never really felt that I connected with them as a power animal. (Of course, I didn't really try to establish a relationship, either.) I approached the process with an open mind, and listened to Track 1 which is a guided meditation to help you find and retrieve your power animal.<br /><br />Farmer's soothing voice led me down into the earth and out into a place where I was to watch for animals that crossed my path. One could imagine a forest, mountain, desert, beach, ocean, and so on, and I was surprised that my visualization actually shifted between all of these terrains. Quite a few animals, including sea creatures and birds, crossed my path--but Farmer says to be on the lookout for the animal that appears 4 times.<br /><br />I was quite surprised that a creature did, in fact, come to me 4 times. Most surprisingly, however, was that it was a creature I did not expect. As I \\"retrieved\\" this beautiful creature withFarmer's guidance, I felt a sacred joy and reverence fill my being--and tears welled up in my eyes.<br /><br />After coming out of the meditation and reading about my power animal, I had to chuckle. It made such sense to me! In fact, in a personality system I have studied, my particular personality is often associated with this particular creature. Even the keyword for my power animal is reflected strongly in my astrological chart!<br /><br />If you're looking for a simple but profound way for discovering your own personal power animals, I highly recommend this book and CD from Dr. Steven Farmer.y eyes.

Every kind action we do for someone is a reanimation of our own life force--and the other person's...Each time you reach out to another person, whether you decide to do a small favor or because you feel compelled to help, you perform an invisible act of power that has profound healing effects for you both.\\" --Carolin Myss in Invisible Acts Of Power - Personal Choices That Create Miracles<br /><br />Caroline Myss, pioneer of energy medicine, has written a brand new book that may forever change how you see yourself in the world.<br /><br />Invisible Acts of Power - Personal Choices That Create Miracles demonstrates how conscious acts of kindness, generosity, and service create meaning, hope, and even health for both the giver and the receiver. Myss contends that all thoughts and interactions are an exchange of power, and maps how this energy manifests itself through each of the 7 chakras. Within the 7 stages of generosity, Myss makes the case that the ability to be generous and the ability to be intuitive are inextricably linked. She breaks new ground in exploring why many people are afraid to be generous--and the ramifcations of \\"holding back\\" or ignoring intuitive guidance.<br /><br />Using both personal stories and those culled from over 1,200 letters that were sent to her website, Myss shares electrifying and heart-warming examples of how kindness towards others actually increases our own power and health--and teaches how we can move from visible to invisible acts of power.<br /><br />Showing how acts of service correspond to the energies of the chakras, we learn how Chakra 1 (the Root Chakra) involves gifts of the Earth such as food and shelter, Chakra 3 (the Solar Plexus Chakra) involves gifts of self-esteem and personal dignity, Chakra 6 (the Third Eye Chakra) involves gifts of the mind, wisdom, and optimism, and so on. Myss also teaches the three myths we hold about power, the highest form of generosity and power and why it is invisible, and how we can become channels of divine grace and miracles.<br /><br />Some of the stories in this book ripped me wide open--spilling tears down my face. As is usually the case with the teachings of Myss, I was both challenged and touched by her sharp, insightful wisdom. Many of the stories moved me deeply--allowing me to remember the importance of a kind word, smile, or even refraining from judging another harshly.<br /><br />If you've lost hope in the goodness of humanity, this book can restore it. If you've lost faith that heaven sees or hears your pain, Invisible Acts of Power will remind you that you are truly loved and always cared for. If you yearn for emotional and spiritual congruence, you'll learn how to calibrate your energy.

About 11 percent of adults over age 55 have an anxiety disorder (USSG, 1999), and about 13 percent of children between 9 and 17 years old have an anxiety disorder (USSG, 1999). Stress is a precursor to anxiety, and studies have shown that workplace stress causes about 1 million U.S. employees to miss work each day. (AIS, 2003)<br /><br />Fortunately, there is a safe, drug-free and effective method for neutralizing, or even eradicating, panic attacks and anxiety: hypnosis.<br /><br />Certified Master Hypnotherapist Victorial Wizell of Hypnotherapy Nevada and HypTalk.com has created Hypnosis For Anxiety Relief, a 7 session program on 2 CD's. The first CD covers the nature of a panic attack, and tools and techniques to eliminate them. According to Ms. Wizell, there are three main fears that goes through a person's mind when they have a panic attack:<br /><br />1. Fear of dying of a heart attack<br />2. Fear of dying from suffocation<br />3. Fear of dying from a stroke<br /><br />Wizell explains what happens physiologically and biologically during a panic attack--and how, for example, it's impossible to suffocate during a panic attack because the body is actually hyper-oxygenated. In fact, she says that with deep breathing, it's impossible to have a panic attack. Wizell also discusses the flight or fight response, and how stress makes us vulnerable to a anxiety. As well, she explains the \\"relaxation response\\"--a response we can learn in order to re-train the body to feel peace and well-being.<br /><br />Seven different exercises and techniques are covered in the 2 audio CD's, including diaphragmic breathing, getting rid of hyperventilation, progessive muscle relaxation, and NLP (neuro-linguistic programming). Several of these techniques are 12-15 minute hypnosis sessions on separate tracks, so you can pick and choose the technique/s that work best for you.<br /><br />Two years ago, I was having low-grade anxiety attacks because of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. However, I didn't realize they were panic attacks! It wasn't until I thought I was having a heart attack that I went to the Emergency Room. When the ER doctor told me I was experiencing anxiety, I was floored. Me? Anxiety? Fortunately, the tests that he ran and the information he shared with me was enough to neutralize feelings of anxiety. Armed with information and clarity, I never had an anxiety attack again (thankfully). I wish I had the Hypnosis For Anxiety Relief series when I was going through my own bout with anxiety--especially to learn deep breathing and visualization techniques, as well as having the extra boost of Wizell's hypnotherapy.<br /><br />Ms. Wizell has such a soothing, calming voice which is often coupled with the soft melody of Pachebel's Canon. Whether she's leading a hypnosis session to \\"anchor in peace\\" or neutralize anxiety by seeing it as an \\"object\\", it was very easy for me to relax and visualize. After the progressive muscle relaxation session, I was amazed at how relaxed I felt physically and how clear I was mentally. Her sessions really \\"bring you in the now\\", which is important. Most panic attacks occur because of \\"what ifs\\" that are future based--and our imaginations and worry trigger the flight or fight response as effectively as an actual threat would.<br /><br />She also shares her own experiences, such as the panic attacks she used to experience while driving down the L.A. highway, as well as her extreme fear of needles.

The author shows you how to experience and \\"feel\\" each element for yourself through guided meditations and conscious ritual. Also included in the book are a variety of cutom-made quizzes and checklists to help you determine which element/s are abundant or lacking in your life. Quizzes and checklists include What I Like About Myself and The Elements In Daily Life, where the reader assesses the elements in home, clothing, art, work, and so on.<br /><br />Perhaps the neatest aspect to this book is that the author has amassed a comprehensive perfume/cologne database listing the primary elements for popular fragrances. (For example, Happy from Clinique is Water, while Tommy for men is primarily Air.)<br /><br />I am not a Pagan or Wiccan (I'm a \\"New Ager\\"), so the \\"spells\\", rituals, and pagantalk were lost on me.

For example, Neo-pagans may choose a magickal name for ceremonial purposes, while those in the New Age may adopt a name reflecting healing properties or one received during meditation or dreams.<br /><br />Naming With Astrology<br /><br />Choosing a powerful, meaningful name can be a daunting task, but the authors have made the process easier by providing various methods for choosing the perfect name. For example, a name that harmonizes with a person's astrological birth sign enhances the characteristics associated with that sign. For each of the 12 signs of the Zodiac, the authors have compiled astrological symbolism, mythological correspondences and archetypes, traits, and characteristics. Based on those elements, 20 male names and 20 female names are suggested for each of the 12 signs.<br /><br />Naming From Mythology<br /><br />The names of heroes, heroines, gods and goddesses offer inspiration and empowerment by their very nature.

No one is specially gifted. There are only those who are free to choose to capitalize upon their inner strengths or to shrink from them.\\" -- from the book Angel Medicine - How To Heal The Body And Mind With The Help Of Angels by Dr. Doreen Virtue<br /><br />When Doreen Virtue visited Santorini Island in Greece recently, she was contacted by a powerful group of angels calling themselves the \\"angels of Atlantis.\\" She was then taken on an amazing spiritual adventure, where she uncovered the ancient secrets of the healing temples of the lost civilizations of Atlantis. Doreen soon realized that the information given to her by these Atlantean angels coincided with her previous healing work with the angels, as well as the thousands of case studies she had amassed over the years. Doreen also visited England, Scotland and Ireland, and received profound insights about ley lines, Stonehenge, global healing, and energetic portals.<br /><br />Angel Medicine: How to Heal the Body and Mind With the Help of the Angels relates Doreen's exciting dialogue with the angels of Atlantis, Hermes, the stone spirits of Stonehenge, and more. Written in three parts, Angel Medicine reveals Atlantean healing methods, scientific studies and case histories on angel medicine and energy healing, and the importance of light, love, prayer and sunshine.<br /><br />You'll also learn crystal healing with light, colors and auras, and how to cleanse the chakras with Raphael's \\"Deep Foam Cleaning\\" and Michael's powerful spiritual vacuum. One of my favorite parts of this book is the helpful information on etheric cord cutting. According to Doreen:<br /><br />\\"Whenever we have relationships involving fear of any kind, we form an unhealthy attachment to one another. This attachment is like a leash that says, 'Don't change!', 'Don't leave me!', or 'Don't hurt me!'. These attachments are both palpable and visible when you notice them. I call them 'etheric cords', because they look like surgical tubing attached from one person to another. (In some cases, the cords go from a person to a material object that they're afraid of losing.) Etheric cords are hardened forms of dysfunction, which you can notice with your psychic senses.\\"<br /><br />Doreen explains how these etheric cords can drain energy without our conscious awareness, and how others can send us negative energy through this cord--often resulting in physical pain that appears to have no medical cause. Some simple but effective cord-cutting methods she shares includes:<br /><br />*Cutting cords with the Archangel Michael<br />*Cutting stubborn cords<br />*Addiction cord cutting<br />*Cutting cords to material objects<br /><br />Readers are also shown how to lift curses and daggers, remove entities and earthbound spirits, shield against psychic attacks, and sever vows. In addition, a comprehensive chart details the 15 Archangels and their correspondences such as:<br /><br />*Meaning of the Archangel's name<br />*Specialty<br />*Aura color<br />*Related Crystal<br /><br />An extensive 5-page section is dedicated to crystal selection, and is arranged alphabetically according to ailment or issue. Over 150 ailments and issues are listed in this comprehensive section. For example:<br /><br />Autism: Tektite; gold<br />Blood pressure: Dioptase; bloodstone; turquoise<br />Cancer: Sugilite; rhodocrosite; flame aura quartz<br />Diabetes: Amethyst; owyhee japser; malachite<br />Energy (increasing): Peridot; jasper; amber<br />Fibromyalgia: Aventurine; imperial topaz<br />Grief: Obsidian; lapis lazuli; rose quartz<br />Heartburn: Fluorite<br />Money Issues: Jade; cinnabar; citrine<br />Performance Anxiety: Red tiger's eye; moonstone; aquamarine<br /><br />Angel Medicine: How to Heal the Body and Mind With the Help of the Angels features case studies of angelic and energetic healings, as well as channelings from the angels of Atlantis, Hermes, ArchangelMichael, and the stone spirits of Stonehenge. Doreen asked the wise stone spirits: What message would you like to give to me, and to anyone who reads your words?\\" I found their answer particularly inspiring:<br /><br />\\"Reclaim your manifestation and healing powers immediately! Religious practices have discouraged individuals from seeking power by inflicting labels of heresy and treason upon them. The guilt and fear still permeates deep in the subconscious mind.

A form of divination known as sortilege, dice made out of stone, bone, ivory, or wood have been used for casting lots, gaining insights, and foretelling the future.<br /><br />Although familiar with other forms of divination, I had not yet used dice or any form of sortilege. Therefore, it was with great curiosity and interest that I examined Decision Dice - Your Every Question Answered by Richard Craze. This unique kit comes in a sturdy, glossy square box that is split diagonally, giving it a flip-top opening. Inside the box is a small, but thick, 336-page book, a 9-piece casting board, and 3 wooden dice. The casting board is really a puzzle that forms a wheel/pie divided into 12 sections, and the dice are color coded: black, cream, and brown.<br /><br />Given the various ways dice can be used, I thought this system may be confusing to use. However, after reading the brief explanations of how to use the Decision Dice system, I found it pretty straightforward. There are three ways you can use the dice for answering questions:<br /><br />Yes/No Questions<br /><br />This method answers yes and no questions, with qualifications. You roll the dice, add up the total, and read the explanation. For example, if you roll a 4, it means Yes. But it will only bring disappointments and disasters. Roll a 5, and it means No. But this is a good thing. There are 18 possibilities using this method.<br /><br />General Questions<br /><br />Sometimes, we have a general question in mind when using divination. \\"Will I meet someone soon?\\" or \\"What will happen with my job?\\" are such questions. With this method, each of the color-coded dice mean something specific, as does the numbers on the dice. After quieting yourself, ask the question and roll the dice. This section is divided into dice number totals, with subdivision being the actual dice combination. For example, you may roll a 10 which means Success. However, you need to find your exact combination, which is shown graphically in the book. For example, if you threw:<br /><br />Black die: 5<br />Cream die: 1<br />Brown die: 4<br /><br />you'd look for that particular configuration under number 10 Success. Likewise, if you were to roll:<br /><br />Black die: 6<br />Cream die: 2<br />Brown die: 2<br /><br />Each reading has a page long description, so even readings falling under the same general heading (like Success) will be somewhat different.<br /><br />Specific Questions<br /><br />Each colored die has a particular meaning. With this method, you meditate on your question, and choose which color die address the spirit of your question the best. For example, if you were to inquire about health, you'd use the Brown die. To inquire about career or finances, you'd toss the Cream die. For difficulties, life lessons, or the law, you'd toss the Black die. After choosing your die, you then cast it upon the board which is like a pie or spoked wheel divided into 12 \\"slices\\". The readings in this section are based upon the number on the die, and which numbered section on the board the die fell upon.<br /><br />So, if I were to ask a question about education, I would choose the Cream die, and toss it on the board. Let's say I rolled a 3, and the die landed on segment (\\"pie slice\\") 6. Segment 6 deals with Discipline, so I would look under this section for Cream dice numbered 3. The reading for that combination is\\" I don't imagine for a moment that you realize the seriousness of this situation. You need to exercise some discipline or things will get even worse.<br /><br />Does It Work?<br /><br />With any form of divination, the important question that needs answered is Does it work?. There are two things I look for when evaluating a divination tool:<br /><br />*Is it user friendly?<br />*Is it accurate?<br /><br />It could be argued that the accuracy of any divination tool is based upon the clear-seeing and openness of the reader.<br /><br />One of my regular clients contacted me recently for a reading. I usually use cards, but asked her if she'd like to give Decision Dice a test run for her reading. If she didn't like the reading for any reason, I'd do my regular card reading for her.<br /><br />She agreed, and I performed the reading. For whatever reason, perhaps the unfamiliarity, she said she preferred my card reading. Interestingly, the cards confirmed the same messages given in the Decision Dice reading! Based on this test-run, as well as having used it a few times for myself, I'd have to say the Decision Dice method is both quick and accurate. You are not required to memorize anything, and readings are spelled out clearly for any eventuality.<br /><br />If you're looking for a new divination tool, or would like a method that is less intimidating and complex than ones like traditional Runes, Tarot, or the I Ching, I highly recommend Decision Dice by Richard Craze.r her reading.

In this intimate manner Amma had blessed and consoled more than 21 million people throughout the world. Over time, Amma's popularity has risen to the point where in India she has been known to individually hug over 18,000 people in one day, sitting sometimes for over 20 hours. She travels all around the world to receive all her children around the globe.<br /><br />When asked, Amma says that her religion is love and service. Ever since she was a young girl, she would meditate and sing beautiful songs to the Lord, often slipping into God-intoxicated states. Because she was born with dark skin and acted \\"un-childlike\\" with her intense spiritual devotion, she was viewed by her parents as inferior to other children. Some villagers called her \\"crazy girl\\". She served the elderly, the poor and sick neighbors with love and care. Her parents were horrified to see her mingle with untouchables and forbade her to give away any more of their food, but she continued to do so despite their punishments.<br /><br />As an adult, Amma has inspired innumerable humanitarian activities all over the world. Some of these outreaches include free food and clothing programs, charitable hospitals, hospices, disaster relief programs, free homes for the poor and the needy, medical camps, orphanages, schools, educational institutions, free legal advice, preservation of nature and so on. The list is long and growing everyday, and in 2002, Amma was awarded the Gandhi-King Award for Non-violence.<br /><br />In 1990, psychiatrist Dr. Janine Canan met with Amma and, with Amma's blessing, began collecting quotations from Amma's public talks, personal dialogues and songs. Messages from Amma: In the Language of the Heart is the result of Dr. Canan's compilation and translation, and features the beautiful, inspiring, and healing words of this living saint. Photos of Amma are also shown throughout this 176-page book.<br /><br />Here are some selected quotes from Messages From Amma:<br /><br />Nurturing Energy<br /><br />Man egotistically claims<br />he can push a button<br />and burn the world to ash<br />when he doesn't understand<br />the power that moves his own finger.<br />We must return to the world<br />the nurturing energy of the feminine.<br /><br />Never Blame<br /><br />If you fall into a hole,<br />you don't poke out your eyes<br />because they have failed you.<br />Why not tolerate other's faults as well?<br />When you hurt your hand<br />you don't reproach it,<br />you apply medicine and nurse it with care.<br />So too should we care for others<br />never blaming them for their faults.<br /><br />Beloved Deity<br /><br />Meditating on a divine form will help you<br />develop concentration and mental purity.<br />The pure aspect of your beloved divinity<br />will grow within you without your realizing it.<br />Love for a formless God rarely develops<br />as easily as for a God you can visualize.<br />Following the path of knowledge without love<br />and devotion is like eating stones.<br />Formless all-powerful God readily assumes a form<br />for the sake of the devotee.<br />With complete faith and confidence<br />in your beloved deity, you will reach the goal.<br /><br />I found this 176-paged book uplifting, comforting, and profoundly insightful.

We must return to the world  the nurturing energy of the feminine.    Never Blame    If you fall into a hole,   you don't poke out your eyes  because they have failed you.  Why not tolerate other's faults as well?  When you hurt your hand  you don't reproach it,  you apply medicine and nurse it with care.  So too should we care for others  never blaming them for their faults.    Beloved Deity    Meditating on a divine form will help you  develop concentration and mental purity.  The pure aspect of your beloved divinity   will grow within you without your realizing it.  Love for a formless God rarely develops  as easily as for a God you can visualize.  Following the path of knowledge without love  and devotion is like eating stones.  Formless all-powerful God readily assumes a form  for the sake of the devotee.

Or you've bumped into someone on the street you've been thinking about? Perhaps you've met the perfect client or life partner--just by fate or being at the right place at the right time? All of these experiences are evidence of the Law of Attraction in your life. Have you heard about people who find themselves in bad relationships--over and over again--and who are always complaining that they keep attracting the same kind of relationship? The Law of Attraction is at work for them, too. The Law of Attraction delivers both what is wanted and unwanted.\\" --Michael Losier in The Law Of Attraction<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that The Law of Attraction is one of those rare books that can instantly change your life. It's not hype, because I tried the exercises listed in this book and had observable results within the hour. More on my personal experience a bit later.<br /><br />You may be wondering What is the Law of Attraction? Simply put, the Law of Atraction states: \\"I attract to my life whatever I give my energy, focus, and attention to, whether wanted or unwanted\\". Everything in the world is made up of energy which vibrates at a certain level. When someone has \\"bad vibes\\", they are sending off negative energy. Have you ever heard the phrases like attracts like, birds of a feather flock together, and misery loves company? These popular phrases are evidence of the Law of Attraction. There are other phrases and words that describe this universal law, including:<br /><br />*Serendipity<br />*Synchronicity<br />*Fate<br />*Karma<br />*Luck<br />*Meant to be<br /><br />According to author Michael Losier The Law of Attraction responds to whatever vibration you are offering, by giving you more of what you are vibrating. In our bodies, our \\"vibration\\" is translated as feelings. When we feel enthusiastic, loving, confident, or content, we are vibrating positively. When we feel sad, stressed, angry, or ashamed, we are vibrating negatively. This is why viewing negative events causes us to feel badly. Likewise, witnessing beauty or acts of kindess causes us to feel good.<br /><br />It has been said that we \\"create our own reality\\". Regardless of whether or not we are doing it intentionally, we draw circumstances and people towards us that match our vibration (feelings). We are constantly thinking thoughts, and those thoughts produce feelings (vibration). The Law of Attraction teaches us how to deliberately attract more of what we want (as opposed to unconsciously attracting what we don't).<br /><br />What Losier shows us is that how we feel about something--and what we focus upon--attracts situations and people with matching vibration. He then gives us tools to raise our vibration, and attract our ideal situation--which is exciting! The three-step formula for deliberate attraction is:<br /><br />*Identify your desire<br />*Raise your vibration<br />*Allow it<br /><br />The instructions are clear and simple, and can be performed quickly. Losier provides two case studies, and guides you through the three-step process with worksheets. There is even a webpage listed in the book where you can download additional worksheets.<br /><br />I've read other Law of Attraction books, but something seemed to be missing. I found the process frustrating and disheartening, quite frankly, and gave up on the concept (despite knowing there was truth to it). Losier provides the missing piece through his Clarity Through Contrast worksheet, as well as the Desire Statement. Both of these exercises focus our attention on an ideal, so it's easy to get excited about attracting what you desire. I think this is why so many people have trouble with affirmations: you don't feel good about saying a situation is one way, when it is really another. So while positive thinking alone may help with redirecting thoughts, they don't \\"blow our fan\\", as Losier iswont to say, until those thoughts are accompanied by positive feelings.<br /><br />~My Personal Experience~<br /><br />After I read this book (it's a quick read), I printed out the Worksheets online, and completed them as instructed. I knew immediately what I wanted to attract even before I finished the book: my ideal experience writing my first novel. Up until a few days ago, I had experienced huge resistance to writing my novel. I'd get sick to my stomach and procrastinate because I dreaded sitting down and writing. (This process has been going on for well over a year, with my procrastination often lasting weeks or months). Yet, I had an outline, plot direction, interesting characters, and unblocked creativity. In fact, when I actually did write, it went quite well.<br /><br />So what was wrong with me?! This \\"creative angst\\" has been \\"hanging over me\\", and I couldn't figure out why my willpower wasn't enough.<br /><br />I did all the worksheets in the book, which didn't take very long. Within an hour, I sat down and wrote over 500 words of my novel with complete ease. The next day, I quickly read over my Desire Statement, and wrote another 500+ words...with complete ease. It's so easy now, that I'm wondering where the dread went! If I feel low level anxiety, I read my Desire Statement, have an influx of peace, and the writing process is as easy as can be. I'm totally amazed. My husband has also read the book, and has done a Desire Statement on finances. And, we've resurrected our \\"wish box\\" (now a blessings jar) that we used to use regularly.<br /><br />As you can see, The Law of Attraction has started a new and exciting chapter in our lives! I'm still in awe that I can walk over to my dining table, and begin writing immediately with complete ease and clear focus.<br /><br />In case you haven't guessed, I highly recommend this book--especially if you want to attract more of what you desire...and less of what you don't.~    After I read this book (it's a quick read), I printed out the Worksheets online, and completed them as instructed.

I don't know about you, but I'm tired of Koontz's obsession with the weather. In \\"One Door Away From Heaven\\", it's the minutae of sunsets and the sky. In \\"The Gift\\" it's the rain (especially on windows). In this book, it's the \\"radiant rain\\" and \\"purplescent fog\\".<br /><br />I've been a fan of Koontz since High School, when a classmate bought me 4 of his books for a Christmas gift exchange. (She found out that I liked Stephen King, and wanted me to try Koontz.) Well, needless to say, I left King and never went back (except for Buick 8).<br /><br />His description of sunsets was pure poetry in \\"One Door Away From Heaven\\", but even that got old after awhile. But then this trend started to emerge in subsequent books. Like my husband said to me: \\"If Koontz ever wants to give up writing, he could be a meteorologist!\\"<br /><br />I almost put this book down because, again, Koontz goes on and on and on with weather descriptions. (I mean, how many times can an author use \\"susurration\\" before the reader says \\"enough already!\\") Reading the first chapter, I felt that Koontz was in love with his poetic treatment of the weather--so much so, that I was actually distracted by it! My husband and I talked before about this new twist in Koontz books, so when I began reading this one, I said \\"You're never going to believe it...\\"--and shoved the book in his hands.<br /><br />The only reason I kept reading the book is because the descriptions of the protagonist and his wife in the first chapter eerily parallelled my husband and myself. If the characters were less interesting, I doubt that I would have continued.<br /><br />In one of the scenes in The Taking, I couldn't help but be reminded of a few elements of \\"Buick 8\\" by King (I'm not going to say what because I don't want to include any spoilers).<br /><br />In my opinion, it's quick plotting that moves the story along--not endless descriptions of the weather and every other godforsaken object that Koontz \\"sees\\" in his mind's eye. Was the book worth my time? No. Was it interesting? Well, if you can look past all the descriptions, you'll probably keep turning the pages. I felt the end was a big let down--a religious cop-out. (And speaking of religious, the tone of the book is a bit preachy).<br /><br />I'd read this book from the library if I were you; don't bother to buy it.

Accompanying these glossy, sturdy cards is a 113 page Guidebook which elaborates on the theme of each card. Because the cards are numbered from 1-52, it's easy to find their correspondences in the Guidebook.<br /><br />There are several ways you can use this powerful and practical deck:<br /><br />*Pick a card for the day and meditate on it's guidance. As you go about your day, look for ways to apply the wisdom imparted by the card. Is the particular card that you drew showing you an area that needs attention?<br /><br />*Ask a question that you need guidance on, and draw a card for the answer.<br /><br />*Do a 3 card spread. Choquette offers an interesting 3 card layout:<br /><br />Card 1 Attitude or frame of mind in which to approach the situation or problem.<br />Card 2 The best way to shift the energy to a higher vibration<br />Card 3 What you're overlooking and need to become aware of.<br /><br />You're only limited by your imagination, because various spreads could be used with these cards.<br /><br />The delightful illustrations by Horacio Cobos accurately captures the essence of each theme, but unfortunately, I find some of the coloring a little muddy.<br /><br />An example from the Guidebook:<br /><br />Card 21 Expect The Best \\"You're being advised by your Higher Self and guides to start each day expecting Divine guidance to direct, support, and happily surprise you. By entering a state of expectation, you create a vacuum in your vibration. The Universe doesn't tolerate a vacuum, so it will seek to fill it with exactly what you expect. If you expect struggle, you attract struggle. If you expect guidance, synchronicity, and celestial gifts, you attract that as well. Your guides are advising you to shift your awareness to positive expectation, which acts like a magnet that attracts all you need when you need it. It creates a powerful vibration that will be felt and answered by your guides immediately. Take the risk and expect good vibes.

It's a force that we all have within us, and we have the power to draw this energy into our lives by being the energy we want to attract.\\" --Dr. Wayne Dyer<br /><br />The Power of Intention Cards by Dr. Wayne Dyer are a wonderful companion to his book The Power Of Intention. However, it is not necessary to have read the book to benefit from the wisdom of this 50-card deck, or to use the cards for daily meditation and guidance.<br /><br />Each card features a simplistic graphic and a brief phrase reflecting a principle from the book The Power Of Intention. On the other side, Dyer expounds on the principle, giving practical insight on how to connect to Source and utilize the power of Intention to attract the energy you desire.<br /><br />For example, on the back of Overcome Ego's Hold card is the wisdom:<br /><br />\\"Let go of your ego's need to be right. When you're in the middle of an argument, ask yourself: Do I want to be right or be happy? When you choose the joyous, loving, spiritual mode, your connection to intention is strengthened.\\"<br /><br />Another example, from the back of the Respect Yourself card:<br /><br />\\"Make an internal commitment to respect yourself and feel worthy of all that the universe has to offer. If you disrespect anyone or anything God creates, you disrespect that creative force and tarnish your connection to the power of intention.\\"<br /><br />The Power of Intention Cards offers powerful tools for personal transformation and inner freedom. Although I initially found the graphics masculine and quite plain, the wisdom contained in the cards outweighed any misgivings I had about the illustrations. I highly recommend this deck.<br /><br />(To see 6 images from this deck, visit the Reviews section at [...])	2004-08-10

Fincher in Creating Mandals 2 - For Balancing, Harmony, and Spiritual Well-Being<br /><br /> Mandalas have been used as a part of spiritual contemplation, ritual, and self discovery since ancient times. Spanning across many cultures, the use of mandalas in architecture, art, and sculpture shows that all humans share common concerns, experiences, and curiosity as to their place in the world. Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung saw mandalas as evidence of a dynamic urge towards individuation--the process where an individual carves out a unique identity.<br /><br /> An American art therapist named Joan Kellogg, in association with psychiatrist Francisco DiLeo, conceptualized 12 stages of growth and development that the human psyche cycles through in a lifetime. A visit to each of these stages of consciousness helps us work through challenges, clarify our understanding, and resolve unfinished business. Kellogg's model is called Archetypal States of the Great Round of Mandala, known as \\"the Great Round\\" for short.<br /><br /> In her first book, Coloring Mandalas - For Insight, Healing, and Self Expression, author Susanne F. Fincher created mandalas to color based on the 12 stages of the Great Round:<br /><br /> Void<br /> Bliss<br /> Labyrinth<br /> Beginning<br /> Target<br /> Dragon Fight<br /> Squaring the Circle<br /> Functioning Ego<br /> Crystallization<br /> Gates of Death<br /> Fragmentation<br /> Transcendent Ecstasy<br /><br /> Kellogg later found it necessary to add a 13th: Stage 0, Clear Light. In her book Creating Mandalas, Fincher elaborates on Kellogg's model more extensively.<br /><br /> In her new book Coloring Mandalas 2 - For Balancing, Harmony, and Spiritual Well-Being, Fincher concentrates on Stage 9, Crystallization. All 72 mandalas in this book are associated with the completion of a cycle of growth that began in the Void (Stage 1). Often resembling crystals, mandalas from the Crystallization stage celebrate our achievements, as well as resting in the pleasure of having fulfilled a personal creative inspiration. Crystallization is also a time of significant spiritual understanding, when our spiritual nature comes together in harmony with our physical nature.<br /><br /> Last Sunday, my husband, son, and myself spent the afternoon coloring mandalas. It was a very peaceful, sacred, and creative time for us. My son colored a mandala from Fincher's first book, while my husband and I worked on mandalas from Coloring Mandalas 2. My husband is an artist, and chose a blank circle to create his particular mandala. I found it interesting that there is an eye in the center of his mandala, especially since it's believed that the \\"I\\" is at the center of a mandala. The center is the place of \\"Christ within\\", the \\"Higher Self\\", or spirit. My mandala and the colors I chose represented, to me, the spectrum of light as demonstrated in a rainbow. Our experiences are polychromatic, and a part of that palatte includes the duality of black/white and Yin/Yang. (The center circle was blank, but I chose to make it a Yin/Yang symbol.) Also, the colors of the 7 chakras are represented in the traditional colors of the rainbow. In my humanness, I often fluctuate between the non-dualistic All-Is-One and the dualism of either/or.<br /><br /> Coloring Mandalas 2 - For Balancing, Harmony, and Spiritual Well-Being is a spiral bound book, so you can easily flip the pages while coloring. You can use any medium you wish, including colored pencils, chalk, temperas, acrylics, crayons, markers, and so on. For ours, we used watercolor pencils. Watercolor pencils are an interesting medium, because you can use a paintbrush dipped in water to achieve a variety of effects.<br /><br /> Fincher explains her purpose in creating Coloring Mandalas 2:<br /><br /> \\"I have chosen to focus on Crystallization mandalas in this book because they embody peace, joy, and fulfillment. Spending time with these mandalas can be relaxing. Coloring them can provide a soothing balance for hectic lifestyles. Interacting with Crystallization mandalas may also help you develop your ability to access a calm state of mind more easily, whenver you choose to. And some of you may look beyond the patterns you see in these mandalas to experience the spiritual energy that inspired them.\\"<br /><br />The Crystallization process promotes a deep feeling of satisfaction about your labors of love and the life you are creating, as well as peace and clarity of mind. I hope you get as much out of this book as I do.oy, and fulfillment. Spending time with these mandalas can be relaxing. Coloring them can provide a soothing balance for hectic lifestyles.

Gena is a tomboy who plays volleyball, and the jokester of the group. It's hard for her to take anything seriously! However, when she picks up a pair of cat-eye sunglasses in a thrift store and sees the future, she doesn't find anything funny about it! Will the woman in the thrift shop fall off a ladder? Will Anne become blind? Is her Dad's girlfriend snooping through her things? Gena becomes obsessed with the information she receives via the special sunglasses--but is she really seeing clearly?<br /><br />The Fortune Tellers Club is a delightful series by professional storyteller Dotti Enderle.

She's on her way to cheerleading camp, and just knows she'll win Cheerleader of the Year! Just moments before she was about to leave, a freak car accident leaves her with an injured leg--and stuck at home. Anne is disappointed and angry. Who's to blame for this? Someone must be at fault! A funeral procession was taking place at the time of the accident; Anne concludes that it's the dead lady's fault. Driven to find out about the nature of fate and the woman who died, she begins a quest for answers. Gena and Juniper make a divination tool out of a glove and give it to Anne as a present. However, is Anne prepared for the life-changing answers she will get?<br /><br />This is the best book of the series, in my opinion. Featuring real-life challenges and family secrets, as well as the fascinating element of divination, Hand of Fate will keep you on the edge of your seat...and wondering about the nature of Fate itself.<br /><br />I'm a fan of good juvenile fiction, and read this genre for relaxation.

This series, geared towards ages 9-12, features three best friends--Juniper Lynch, Anne Donovan, and Gena Richmond--who use divination to solve mysteries, explain relationships, and understand life experiences.<br /><br /> The Lost Girl is the first book of the series, where we're introduced to the Fortune Tellers Club. Gena has lost her retainer, and she knows her Dad will be furious! She calls upon the other two members of the Club to help divine the location of the retainer. They tried to use an Ouija board, but with no success. Juniper decides to gaze into a bowl of water (a form of scrying) but instead of seeing Gena's lost retainer, she sees the gaunt face of a mysterious young girl! They soon find out that a local girl, Laurie Simmons, is missing. Is Laurie the girl that Juniper saw in the bowl? Will divination help them find the missing girl?<br /><br /> I admit, I wasn't big on this first book. I thought the characters were flat and the story so-so. I almost stopped at Book 1, but decided to give Book 2 a chance. I'm glad I did! Books 2-5 are fast-paced and interesting, and the characters are fleshed out nicely. Not only are we given a better sense of the girls' personalities, but also home life, interests, and strengths. Also, the series portrays real-life conflicts, especially with relationships, which young girls will readily identify with. For example, Anne is friends with \\"The Snotty Twins\\" who are fellow cheerleaders. However, Anne's friends don't like Gena and Juniper--and the feeling is mutual from the other two members of the Club!<br /><br /> In my opinion, you don't need to read the first book in order to enjoy the others in the series. However, there are progressing storylines, so reading books later in the series may have the reader just a *little* confused.<br /><br />I'd give the book 2 stars as a stand-alone book, but am giving it 3 since it's the birth of a wonderful series in juvenile fiction.juvenile fiction.	2004-07-23

This is not surprising. More than half the women surveyed in a recent National Sleep Foundation Women and Sleep Poll reported insomnia symptoms sometime during every month. Various studies and polls indicate that nearly 30 million American women claim they long every day for a good night's sleep.\\" -Janet Kinosian, in The Well-Rested Woman - 60 Soothing Suggestions for Getting a Good Night's Sleep<br /><br />For many women, a good night's sleep is a luxury. However, restful and deep sleep is an innate biological need. It's only in the deeper stages of sleep that the body releases growth hormones and regenerates, restores, and repairs organs and tissues.<br /><br />With the demands of modern life, women often juggle work, family, and household-and are just plain exhausted. Beyond not getting enough shut-eye, there are very real sleep disorders that rob individuals of precious, rejuvenating sleep. Surprisingly, it was only until 1996 that the American Medical Association recognized sleep medicine as a secondary specialty. The real kicker is that until the early 1990's, women were often excluded from sleep studies because it was believed that their hormones would skew data. The result? Women don't have a whole lot of scientific history for help with sleep difficulties.<br /><br />The good news is much of this is changing, with sleep researchers finally studying women's sleep cycles, as well as factors such as hormones, age, fertility, work, children, health, pain, etc.<br /><br />The Well-Rested Woman - 60 Soothing Suggestions for Getting a Good Night's Sleep, author Janet Kinosian shares what she has learned about sleep-not as a medical doctor or a Ph.D., but as a female insomniac.<br /><br />While Kinosian briefly discusses the stages of sleep and sleep disorders, as well as female-related issues like perimenopause, menopause, postpartum, and PMS, the bulk of this book is dedicated to practical ways to promote a good night's rest.

Also included are an extensive resource section, listing books, music, organizations, and websites to help you on the journey to restful sleep.<br /><br />Some of the great ideas you'll get from The Well Rested Woman:<br /><br />*Accept Larks Versus Owls<br />*Keep A Sleep Log<br />*Know Your Sleep Positions<br />*Set Regular Wake-Up Calls<br />*Befriend Time<br />*Use Phototherapy<br />*Sleep Strategies For Shift Workers<br />*Silence Snoring Spouses<br /><br />I'm the type of person that is not only a night owl, but also one that doesn't battle insomnia.

In ancient times, priests, poets, and astrologers studied the movements of the planets to understand the cycles of life. Mercury, Jupiter, Neptune-the planets themselves are named after gods and goddesses of civilizations past. MythAstrology by Raven Kaldera is a groundbreaking guide to understanding the archetypal expression of planetary energies through each of the 12 signs of the Zodiac. Accessible to those new to Astrology, having your birth chart is all that is needed to explore this fascinating book.<br /><br />Archetypes are patterns that humans live out on a daily basis. Like grooves in a record, we unconsciously play out these themes. This is why myth, fairy tale, and cinema are so compelling: we recognize the familiar patterns of personal, relational, and universal dramas. Perhaps you are used to playing the Warrior. Or, maybe archetypes like Wounded Child, Teacher, Detective, or Clown are a part of your own personal patterns. Many archetypal patterns \\"dance\\" with one another:  Knight with Damsel, Victim with Bully, Child with Mother, and so on. Archetypal themes even play out on the political, social, and religious stage.<br /><br />Astrology is a discipline that attempts to explain some of these universal archetypal patterns. In MythAstrology, the author goes a step further by correlating myths from diverse mythologies (including Celtic, Hindu, Yoruban, Japanese, and Sumerian) with each planet/sign combinations. For example, if you have Uranus (the Sacred Trickster) in Libra, you may wonder why you've always felt like an outsider...an outcast. Eris, the Greek goddess of Chaos and Strife, knew what it was like to be an outsider. She wasn't invited to the wedding between Thetis and Peleus, but she made an \\"appearance\\", nonetheless. Throwing a golden apple titled \\"for the fairest\\" among the goddesses, Eris sat back, smiling cynically, as the childish bickering and immaturity among the goddesses proved that they were not as independent or powerful as they claimed to be. In Libra, the apple cart that Eris tends to upset is that of love and justice.<br /><br />Or perhaps you have Mercury in Scorpio. Like the Irish triple goddess The Morrigan, you are a keen mental detective who knows how humans tick, what pushes their buttons, and how to make them change. Using your tongue like a scalpel, you have a vitriolic command of language when you desire to wound. But The Morrigan isn't entirely negative; Kaldera writes:<br /><br />\\"A Mercury in Scorpio has the gift of slicing through the glitter and fluff, through layers of illusion and self-defense, to the naked and often ugly truth below. Morrigan's raves perch on their shoulders, croaking warnings into their ears. Hear them. They are the measure of our own desperation.\\"<br /><br />Is your Moon in Aquarius? You'll discover the myth of the Moon Man Mwuetsi, a tale told among the Wahungwe Makoni tribe in Africa which explains Mwuetsi's emotional detachment and yearning to belong to a tribe-- at the expense of those near and dear to him, as well as his own life.<br /><br />This book is 436 pages, and includes an Appendix of both sign and planet archetypes. For each, six or seven archetypes are listed. For example, Virgo is correlated with:<br /><br />The Servant<br />The Monk/Nun<br />The Martyr<br />The Analyst<br />The Critic/Perfectionist<br />The Worker<br /><br />Jupiter is associated with:<br /><br />The Generous Gift-Giver<br />The One Who Thinks Big<br />The Impulsive One<br />\\"Have I Got A Deal For You\\"<br />The Keeper Of Luck<br />The Christmas Present (a la Scrooge)<br /><br />Looking through each list, one or two archetypes from each group are likely to stand out to you; this would indicate how a particular planet or sign usually expresses itself in your life.<br /><br />For those more familiar with astrology, you can use the planet/sign combinations to find planets that aspect each other. Let's say your Venus is in Leo but is also conjunct Pluto; you may want to readabout Venus in Scorpio for added depth of understanding. Also, you may find the myths helpful if you're undergoing a transit. For example, if Uranus is transiting your Moon, reading Moon in Aquarius might help you understand the combination of lunar and Uranian energies. Astrologers can use these myths to explain a client's placements through storytelling-utilizing a more shamanistic and intuitive path of analysis.<br /><br />As one who loves to explore archetypal patterns, I became quickly engrossed in MythAstrology. I went through all of my planet/sign placements and read the corresponding myths. More insightful than the typical astrological profile, and more elucidating than most personality systems, I was taken aback at the accuracy of this book. To see myself nakedly described was uncomfortable, but at the same time, it was encouraging. As the masters of our own personal mythology, we can always choose to embrace the gifts of our archetypal patterns, as well as release those that no longer serve us. As the author says:<br /><br />\\"Whether you're a deist or simply looking at archetypes as ways of being human, you'll find that the myths in this book can start to become real for you, if only in that you'll start seeing them in people all around you. You'll start to see the actions of the people you know in terms of the stories that they are living, and see your own life that way as well. And once you see them, you'll find that you've given yourself more choices about what paths you want to be on, and which you feel you're done with. It's how the right stories can change anyone's world.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this fresh work by Raven Kaldera; MythAstrology is one of the best books about archetypes (not to mention mythology and astrology) that I've had the joy of reading. This one's a real keeper for my reference shelf!For example, if Uranus is transiting your Moon, reading Moon in Aquarius might help you understand the combination of lunar and Uranian energies.

In Buddhism and Hinduism, mandalas usually include images of Buddhas or deities. Yantra is a Sanksrit word for \\"instrument\\", and is meant to inspire inner visualizations, meditations, and spiritual experiences. However, since the two terms are often used interchangeably, the word mandala usually refers to any circular image or diagram.<br /><br />Create Your Own Sand Mandala by Eileen M. Rose and Abby Rose Dalto is a boxed kit that enables you to make your own sand mandalas in the tradition of Tibetan Buddhists. Traditionally, the art of constructing sand mandalas is an ancient Tibetan ritual art that requres extensive training, a high level of artistic skill, and hours of meticulous work.<br /><br />However, the sand mandala is not permanent (glued). They are constructed with impermanence and non-attachment in mind, as well as specific intent. When a sand mandala is constructed, more emphasis is placed on improving the mind of the practitioner and contributing to the greater good of the world than on producing a work of art. After the construction of a mandala, the sand is brushed to the center and scattered in the nearest body of water, representing a dispersion of the intent.<br /><br />The circle has been a sacred symbol for eons, showing up in such forms as Native American Medicine Wheels, gothic Rose Windows, Labyrinths, halos, astrological charts, Celtic designs, alchemical symbols, and so on. There are many ways to construct mandalas, and some forms are permanent--created with paint, fabric, found materials, crushed glass, colored pencils, computer generation, etc. Circles represent wholeness, and coloring or constructing mandalas can be used for meditation, healing, and positive intent.<br /><br />Create Your Own Sand Mandala includes a 96 page book with full color illustrations, bags of sand in five sacred colors (red, yellow, green, blue, and white), 4 glossy, cardboard templates for guidance,a metal funnel to direct the flow of the sand, and a brush for sweeping up the sand.<br /><br />The authors provide colorful examples of personal mandalas, as well as circular forms found in architecture, art, and sculpture, and explain the meanings of colors, totem animals, and sacred geometry. Step-by-step instructions are given to help prepare yourself and the items for mandala construction for meditation, healing and prayer, as well as explaining the many uses of mandalas. It is recommended that you start from the center of the circle when creating a mandala. Many religions acknowledge a sacred center within, whether it be called Soul, Christ within, or Higher Self. Accessing and contemplating this sacred center is the reason for beginning at the middle. Although geometric designs are often used in mandalas, you can make it as personal and free-form as creating a sunny meadow or self-portrait. The purposeful use of colors correlating to certain chakras or meanings, as well as totem animals or other symbols, can be utilized. Or, you can allow symbols and impressions to float into your awareness for inclusion in your mandala.<br /><br />After constructing your mandala, you can scatter the sand into water as the Tibetan Buddhists do, scatter it to the four winds or bury it like the Native Americans, or even put the sand in a locket, jar, or special container. There's no need to worry about using up the sand that's provided, because the authors provide simple and easy instructions on creating your own colored sand.<br /><br />Whether you seek to honor Spirit, tap into your Higher Self, achieve clarity, or intend peace, healing or other purpose, this wonderful boxed kit and book will help guide you through the process of creating life-affirming mandalas.nd in five sacred colors (red, yellow, green, blue, and white), 4 glossy, cardboard templates for guidance,a metal funnel to direct the flow of the sand, and a brush for sweeping up the sand.

The vibations of that moment combine with those of the name we are given to point us in the appropriate direction so that we may fulfill our specific life purpose. By providing clues to our innate talents, abilities, and flaws, numerology is a method of self-discovery that can help us determine who we are where we are headed.&quot; --Phyllis Vega in Numerology For Baby Names - Use the Ancient Art of Numerology to Give Your Baby a Head Start in Life<br />Numerology is an ancient art and science asserting that particular letters have specific vibrations and qualities. A name is made up of a series of numerical vibrations that contain the essence of a person's identity. In Numerology for Baby Names, author Phyllis Vega provides readers with over 5,300 names, including the numerical value and character traits of each number (1-9). Also included in this book is a brief overview of numerology including Pythagorean and Chaldean systems, letter/number conversion table, worksheets, and chart with the lucky colors, gems and metals of each of the 9 numbers. She shows the reader how to calcuate Individual Number Names (first or middle name) as well as the Complete Number Name (the sum of the first, middle, and lat name).<br />The first part of the book dedicates a chapter to each of the 9 personality numbers, including keywords, symbolism, personality, and careers. An alphabetical listing of female, male, and unisex names are given. The second part of the book is an alphabetized master list of female, male, and unisex names and the character number of each.<br />Let's say that you'd like your child's Complete Number Name to be 1. You'd calculate the numeric value of the child's surname (last name) and then look up names that, when added to the surname, would equal number 1. (Note: in Numerology, double digits are reduced to single digits, which is why there are only 9 personality numbers. However, she does address the personality traits of the Master Numbers 11, 22, and 33 which are often not reduced in Numerology) Or, if you have a list of names that you love, you could just look in the master lists in the second part of the book and find out its Individual Number Name value. It's easy to do--especially since the author has done most of the work for us!<br />Vega not only lists over 3,500 names, but also provides the ethnic origin of the name, as well as what it means. So in effect, it also functions as a baby name book, but with an exciting twist.

Sensible, level-headed Bob. I would answer his questions with my usual question, \\"Well, can you explain any of this?\\" I always hoped he could explain because I certainly couldn't. I hoped someone, anyone, could explain. But a past life with John Lennon? I'll let you be the judge. It all started December 9, 1980, the day after John Lennon was shot... --From the book All You Need Is Love, the incredible true story of one woman's search, discovering her past life with John Lennon.<br /><br />I admit to being suspicious when I first picked up All You Need Is Love. I mean, anyone can claim to be the lover of a former Beatle in a past life, right? Interestingly, four years after she began inexplicably grieving at the death of John Lennon, author Jewelle St. James felt the same way: she was ready to hear answers about a past life with John Lennon if she could prove it.<br /><br />Jewelle is from a small, mountainous Canadian town called Revelstoke, which is in British Columbia. Far from the busy world New York City where John Lennon was fatally shot, she nevertheless felt a penetrating ache of loss and even desperation when she heard the news of his death. Perhaps such feelings could be chalked up to the grief of a fan but, interestingly, Jewelle had no interest in the Beatles at the time.<br /><br />The following day, her local paper featured an article by a traveling evangelist with the headline John Lennon: Was He Really So Great? The minister went on to say that John would spend eternity in hell, and that his upcoming sermon would be about the dangers of rock and roll. Jewelle had a strong reaction to this article, and immediately fired off a letter to the editor-something very out of character for her.<br /><br />Over the next three years, Jewelle lived with her intense grief-confused and frustrated as to why she felt this strong connection to John Lennon. She bought a copy of the Imagine album, having never before heard it. When she listened to the song Jealous Guy, she experienced a vivid recollection of an ancient milestone nestled in rich green grass, the darkened granite reading \\"...miles to London\\".<br /><br />Jewelle finally decided to confide in her Mom, who was spiritually minded...even psychic. Her sister Konni, also clairvoyant, helped clarify the details that their Mom had imparted.<br /><br />All You Need Is Love follows Jewelle as she deals with confusion, frustration, hope, and determination-all while she attempts to track down the validity of the names, dates, and places she received from her Mom, her clairvoyant sister, psychics, a past life regression and her own channeled writing history. The story of Catherine James and John Baron is compelling-part mystery, and part romance. But underscoring this amazing tale is the experience of past lives: how their patterns often repeat throughout many lifetimes, how unfinished past-life business creeps into the present, and how one can actually heal emotional wounds and unconscious patterns by discovering elements of past lives.<br /><br />The reader is taken along a fascinating journey with Jewelle as she researches genealogy and Sussex history, visiting England several times and having information confirmed. Weaved throughout her search is the tale of Catherine, son of a merchant, and her lover John Baron-a kindly young man of ill-health. We dance along with Catherine and John in the Great Hall, and trudge along in the thick mud with Catherine as she walks to the hospital to tend to the sick. We grieve with Catherine as she loses her beloved, and must then endure her cruel Aunt Agatha, who ends up drugging her with laudanum as a \\"cure\\" for her grief.<br /><br />Jewelle's story is one of healing and hope-reconciling unfinished business of the past and moving on with a sense of purpose. And, as John would say, with a sense of love-for all you truly need is love.<br /><br />After reading this book, I'm interested in finding out about my own past lives-something I've not even begun to look into. I highly recommend this engrossing and well-documented story of one woman's search for answers--and what that journey has brought to her present life thus far.something I've not even begun to look into.

They make decisions that aren't good for them, which leads them to places other than where they want to be. They become anxious and addictive, acting aggressively, even violently, toward those they love, thus alienating themselves even more. They become stressed, even physically ill, and enjoy no real peace of mind. Wandering around in the darkness of second guessing and worry, they fight against life or get trampled beneath it and fail to achieve their purpose or spiritual goals, thus wasting, instead of living, their lives.\\" --Sonia Choquette, PhD. in Trust Your Vibes<br /><br />For those who dwell in the realm of five-sensory living, the idea of being guided daily by intuition may seem illogical, flaky, and \\"woo woo\\". Others may view the concept of trusting vibes as mysterious and exotic, relegated to only \\"special\\" people born with psychic gifts.<br /><br />However, in the new book Trust Your Vibes: Secret Tools for Six-Sensory Living, spiritual teacher and psychic Sonia Choquette de-mystifies the process of using your intuition--or vibes--to navigate through life. Choquette, who has actively used her psychic perception since age 12, asserts than anyone can access their sixth sense. In fact, she believes it's absolutely urgent that humanity begin to awaken to their intuition. We are hurting one another, killing in the name of God, and drugging ourselves in epidemic proportions. Where does six-sensory living come in? It helps us to realize how we are all interconnected and interdependent, which in turn helps us in healing ourselves, our relationships, and the planet. According to Choquette:<br /><br />\\"Following our vibes serves as a great deterrent to the downward spiral of personal and global self-destruction that we find ourselves tangled in today. When we trust our vibes, we restore our balance and experience within--which, ultimately, leads to peace without.\\"<br /><br />An often frustrating aspect to self-development style books is that we're usually instructed on what to do (or not to do)...but it's rare to find a book that also connects the dots as to the whys and hows. Not only does Choquette offer compelling evidence as to the \\"whys\\", but she also outlines 33 secret practices that six-sensory people use every day to navigate the unseen world of spirit--the \\"hows\\".<br /><br />Weaving in astounding stories from her personal and professional experience--as well as those of her clients, colleagues, and students--Choquette illustrates the whys and hows of hearing, trusting, and following intuition. Here are a few small exercerpts from the 33 secret practices:<br /><br />Secret 5: Easy Does It \\"...Adrenaline is a highly toxic and addictive substance if you're subjected to it in large quantities...Besides being difficult to wean from, excessive adrenaline is to your intuition what kryptonite is to Superman: lethal. A burst of adrenaline may leave you feeling temporarily powerful, but will end up depleting you...\\"<br /><br />Secret 7: Observe, Don't Absorb \\"...It's a myth that caring requires commiserating. Caring means allowing somoene space to sort things out without throwing your emotions into the already-overloaded mix...\\"<br /><br />Secret 14: Write It Down \\"...Recording your vibes is the most direct physical way to march your mind across the bridge from an ego-based, five-sensory reality to a spirit-based, six-sensory one. Like a diver on a treasure hunt, each newly seized message from your psychic sense will help build a platform of reason on which to stand. You'll no longer just have a feeling--you'll have verification that your vibes are legitimate guides that help you in life...\\"<br /><br />Secret 28: Laughing Matters \\"...Some people can't distinguish between the ego and the sixth sense. Here's the difference: Your spirit is relaxed, forgiving, and laughs a lot, especially at you and your own antics; and your ego is critical and controlling and rarely laughs at anything, especially itself. The soul gently requests and trusts, while the ego demands and is suspicious. The soul is light and easy and loves adventures; the ego can be harsh and heavy and gets stuck in the mud...\\"<br /><br />Every once in awhile, I come across a book that I enjoy so thoroughly and find so pratical and valuable that I wish I could give a copy to everyone I know and meeet. This is one such book. If you're a five-sensory person interested in accessing, trusting, and following your intuition, Trust Your Vibes shows you how to change the rules that run your life (and make you miserable), leading you back to your inner psychic navigational system.<br /><br />If living a six-sensory life is as natural to you as breathing, you'll gain valuable information on enhancing intuitive perception, operating from a soul-based perspective rather than an ego-based one, and living more joyfully and enthusiastically.

It goes without saying that drinking a delicious cup or two as you read or reread this book is of course highly recommended.\\" -- Theresa Cheung in Coffee Wisdom<br /><br />Seven steaming principles for a more happy, contented life can be found right under your nose--and in your cup of coffee!<br /><br />In the delightful book Coffee Wisdom - 7 Finely-Ground Principles for Living a Full-Bodied Life, author Theresa Cheung has brewed up a one-of-a-kind guidebook to both life and coffee. Featuring coffee-personality quizzes, trivia, and quotes, she shows readers how the pleasures of coffee growing, making and drinking parallel 7 principles for better living:<br /><br />1. Reheating causes bitterness. Your past is the reason, not the excuse.<br />2. Start with fresh grounds. Learn from your mistakes, don't repeat them.<br />3. Use the correct grind. Put right what you can and accept what you can't.<br />4. Use high-quality beans and fresh, pure, cold water. Celebrate your uniqueness.<br />5. Get the proportions right. Challenge irrational thinking.<br />6. Boiling destroys the flavor. Check your stress levels.<br />7. Drink it while its hot. Live in the present.<br /><br />From the \\"penny universities\\" in 18th century London, to celebrated coffee drinkers like Voltaire and Beethoven, this 173 paged book gives fascinating tidbits on the history of coffee and its notorious drinkers. For example, did you know that France's most prolific author, Honore de Balzac, drank over sixty cups of coffee a day and slept only 2 hours a night? Or that Bach loved coffee so much he composed Coffee Cantata?<br /><br />This books provides much more than coffee trivia, self-tests, and recipes, however. Cheung serves as an encourager and cheerleader, coaxing readers to release mindsets and habits that no longer serve our well-being and growth. She shares the story of Roger Bannister, the runner who smashed the world record by running a mile in 4 minutes. After that barrier was broken, runners all over the world began to run 4-minute miles.

You are free to choose new avenues for joy...and in your joyous growth, you will add to the experience of All-That-Is.\\" --The Teachings of Abraham - Well Being Cards<br /><br />Abraham is a group of highly evolved teachers who speak their broader non-physical perspective through the earthly vessel of Esther Hicks. They express clearly and simply the laws of the universe, explaining in detail how we can deliberately flow with these laws for the joyful creation of whatever we desire. Abraham speaks to our level of comprehension (from their present moment to our now) through a series of loving and brilliant (yet comprehensively simple) teachings.<br /><br />A brand new release from Hay House, The Teachings of Abraham - Well Being Cards is a 60 card deck that encompasses gems of wisdom gathered from these powerful teachers of practical spirituality. When I began reading through this deck, I was struck by the energetic expansiveness surrounding these cards. Allowing. Ease. Joy. Profound simplicity. Peace. Calm. Clarity. These are the impressions I receive when I hold these cards, and meditate on the teachings of Abraham.<br /><br />These colorful high-gloss cards are illustrated with whimsical images; on one side is a sentence-long nugget of wisdom, and on the other is a short elaboration of the concept. Some examples include:<br /><br />No one else needs to know this. It is not necessary for even one other person to understand these Laws of the Universe...for you are the attractor of your experience. Just You!<br /><br />It is my dominant intent to look for what I want to see. As you deliberately look for things to appreciate, praise, or enjoy, you achieve vibrational harmony with your own Source, and with all that is good. And then, the powerful Law of Attraction brings more good things to you.<br /><br />I'm not here to fix anything; I'm here for fun. You are not here to fix anything, because nothing is broken, but everything is continually changing and expanding. Release your struggle, and seek joy and fun, and in doing so, you will align with the fantastic expanding rhythm of this Universe.<br /><br />To allow Well-being, I must be in joy. In the same way you cannot set your radio tuner to 98.6 and receive the songs playing on 101 FM, you must set your own vibrational tuner to one of Well-being. Feelings of love, joy, passion, exhilaration, fun, interest...are indicates of your vibrational match to Well-being.<br /><br />My future isn't about my past. (Life is only about NOW.) Nothing that has ever happened has anything to do with now, unless, in my now, I continue to think and speak about it. Fresh new thoughts today will always give me a fresh new experience.<br /><br />The Teachings Of Abraham - Well Being Cards have already had a profound affect on me, bringing my intentions, highest desires, and greatest joys into sharper focus. I highly recommend this uplifting deck.<br /><br />(To see 9 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])ng and expanding.

Eliot called it, is a wonderful divinatory tool--and much more. Just like the mysterious reader turning over the cards to reveal your life, as you turn these pages, you will be introduced to the rich and exciting world of tarot. You will learn many ways to use the tarot to enhance and enchant your life.\\" --Barbara Moore in What Tarot Can Do For You<br /><br />You may be familiar with the idea of using the tarot for divinatory purposes, but in What Tarot Can Do for You - Your Future in the Cards, author Barbara Moore shows you how this fascinating tool can be used for so much more. This book teaches you how to ask considered, probing questions of the tarot which is the foundation of receiving accurate, insightful answers. Moore also covers the archetypal, basic meanings of the cards, numbers, and suits as the starting point towards a fully-formed understanding of the tarot, and gives an overview of 17 different decks.<br /><br />Case studies featuring specific scenarios, spreads, questions, and decks provide practical methods for using the tarot for problem solving, divination, journaling, and healing. I especially liked the Achieving Your Goal Spread, and used it for a journal exercise. It's an unusual spread, because you consciously pick 2 of the cards. You start out by looking through the deck and picking a card that seems to represent your current situation. Then, you pick another card that you feel represents your goal. Depending on the magnitude of the challenge or goal, you then decide how many cards to pick at random from the deck. These cards will represent the steps between where you're at and your goal. If you're unsure, picking 3 cards is a good start.<br /><br />I used The Golden Tarot for this exercise and it worked incredibly well. First, I described what I saw in the first card I picked which represented the current situation, and then I journaled what I saw in the card representing the goal. I then shuffled the deck, images face down, and drew 3 cards that represented the steps involved from getting from here to there. I then journaled the \\"story\\" that flowed from the cards which led to the goal. It was an exciting and insightful exercise!<br /><br />Moore also shows how you can use the tarot for rituals, self-improvement, and healing. She even shows you how to discover your Life Card based on the numerology of your birthdate, as well as your Year Card based on your birthdate and the current year. The Life Card reflects your life purpose or the lesson you need to learn as well as strengths to develop and challenges to overcome. The Year Card shows the same, but for the current year.<br /><br />Spreads (card layouts) are also addressed, including an explanation of the Celtic Cross, various 3-card spreads, and how to create your own spreads. Perhaps the most intriguing spread that Moore shares is one created by renowned tarot author Rachel Pollack. It is called the Alternate Major Arcana Spread which has the querent shuffle the Major Arcana and lay them out in three rows. The first row represents the first steps we go through from birth to young adult. The second row illustrates the universal laws or rules of society that we must confront, question, and come to terms with. The third row is our spiritual development. Moore delves into the meaning of this spread, as well as provides a case study to show how a person would read their Alternate Major Arcana Spread for insights into their spiritual development.<br /><br />Lastly, What Tarot Can Do For You provides a glossary of terms and a suggested reading list for various topics in tarot, divination, Wicca/magic, and more.<br /><br />Although I've just finished reading this book, I've already found several of the exercises immediately useful and practical. I'm especially excited about the meditation and journaling aspects, which help me to slow down and record insights about my own life; this is something that professional readers like myself sometimes forget to do.<br /><br />This book is excellent for those beginning tarot, but provides wonderful tips for seasoned readers as well.his book is excellent for those beginning tarot, but provides wonderful tips for seasoned readers as well.	2004-05-25

What about your state of health, honesty, sanity, motivation, sobriety and intelligence?<br /><br />According to Handwriting Analysis - Putting It to Work For You handwriting reveals these traits and a whole lot more. Author Andrea McNichol is an expert graphologist who has been consulted by law enforcement agencies, the State Department, and Fortune 500 companies. She has also served as an Examiner of Questioned Documents in such cases as the Howard Hughes will, the Ted Bundy murders, and the Hitler Diaries. McNichol brings her extensive expertise and insights to this very readable, interactive book.<br /><br />At the onset, you are asked to write a lengthy handwriting sample on unlined paper. As she says, the more you write, the happier you'll be later when you find out what it all means! Why? Well, once you find out about the many aspects of handwriting analysis, it is likely to affect your handwriting especially in the initial stages. So to write some samples helps give a more unbiased picture of your traits. It's so much fun (not to mention utterly fascinating!) to compare writing samples to the examples and traits listed in this book. Now, my husband and I analyze everything from restaurant bills to signatures, holiday cards, and more.<br /><br />McNichol uses actual case studies and handwriting samples as she teaches you graphology. For example, the reader is presented with two handwriting samples: one is an authentic note from the Zodiac killer (suspected of murdering more than sixty peopled in the San Francisco Bay area during the late 1960's and the 1970's) and a fake. The giveaway to the real note? The \\"Maniac d\\" that McNichol discusses earlier in the chapter. A Maniac d is when the letter suddenly takes off at an acute angle to the right. It indicates a person who can lose emotional control, who can sudddenly go off the deep end. People who exhibit frequent and severely rightward Maniac d's are known to be extremely dangerous.<br /><br />Here are just a few of the many tidbits found in this 351 page book:<br /><br />*The combination of heavy pressure with a rightward slant is made by unforgettable, go-getter types. They express a wealth of emotions readily and with fervor, and cannot be taken lightly.<br /><br />*A writer who \\"stabs\\" his ovals can be thought of as \\"one who speaks with forked tongue\\".<br /><br />*Cursive handwriting with few or no lead-in strokes means intelligence, directness, efficiency, and speed.<br /><br />*If a person's signature is pretty much the same as the rest of their writing (size, style, slant, pressure and spacing) this means that the person behaves the same way in public as in private.<br /><br />*The writer with a long lower zone is usually restless and in constant need of variety and change. The longer the lower zone, the more restless the writer. Graphologist have found these people to be the job hoppers and the mate hoppers.<br /><br />*An overly wide left margin indicates that the person is subconsciously putting up an imaginary barrier between himself and the past.<br /><br />In addition to giving samples of writing from actual case histories (including employee theft, check forgeries and a babysitter on drugs), McNichol also delves into the world of doodles and signatures. In fact, she shares an extensive collection of signatures from celebrities including Liberace, Jesse Jackson, Vanna White, Bette Midler, Ingrid Bergman, William Shatner, and many others--and what their signatures indicate. She even contrasts former President Ronald Reagan's signature before he was shot in 1981 to his signature just a few weeks later. His handwriting was shaky, and had a descending baseline on the first name. (McNichol details how handwriting has three zones, and different elements in these zones actually indicate health situations and the area they affect.)<br /><br />Filled with dozens of illustrations and examples in every chapter, as well asquizzes, tidbits, and charts, Handwriting Analysis - Putting It to Work for You puts you on the fast-track to deciphering your handwriting and doodles--and that of others. If you're intrigued by personality and psychology, as well as criminal forensics and mysteries, you'll definitely enjoy this informative and easy-to-read book.the fast-track to deciphering your handwriting and doodles--and that of others.

We have issues that only get activated relationships. Using astrology as a tool for exploring your relationships, at a minimum provides a framework for exploring every nook and cranny of your personal relationship portrait, and every nook and cranny of the combined energy of a relationship.\\" -- David Pond, from Mapping Your Romantic Relationships - Discover Your Love Potential<br /><br />Synastry is the astrology of relationships. By comparing the natal charts of two people, a picture emerges as to the challenges, strengths, and potentials of the relationship. While the title of this book implies romantic unions, Mapping Your Romantic Relationships: Discover Your Love Potential can be used for any type of relationship, including parent and child, friends, and co-workers.<br /><br />There are many neat elements to this book, the primary one being that it comes with a CD-ROM. Without any prior knowledge of astrology, you can pop the disk into your hard drive, enter the birth information of two individuals, and generate an in-depth analysis of the relationship. I generated a report for my husband and myself last night, and it was extremely accurate--detailing 52 separate aspects of our relationship.<br /><br />Another unique element is that this book and CD-ROM includes hard-to-find Chiron interpretations, as well as interpretations for the North Nodes of the Moon (my two favorite elements of astrology!). The software gives you the choice of 12 different House Systems (I use Placidus, myself), as well as whether you want Tropical or Sidereal Zodiac.<br /><br />The author likens our lives to a grand movie, where we are the director of the play of our lives. Providing an easy-to-understand tutorial on the planetary bodies(the characters in your life play), the signs (the scripts and roles the characters are to perform), the houses (the setting where the characters play out their roles) and aspects (how the characters either support, or are in conflict with, each other), this 246 page book prepares the reader to delve into the art of relationship astrology.<br /><br />Part Two examines relationship profiles and houses such as the Sun through the houses and signs and its aspect in your chart, the Moon through the houses and signs and its aspect in your chart, and so on.<br /><br />Part Three discusses synastry, the art of chart comparison. Pond shares some planet comparisons, intra-aspects and the synastry table, and Bill and Hillary Clinton's relationship astrology.<br /><br />If you are a nosy Scorpio like myself, you'll enjoy having this handy book and CD-ROM to compare the charts of your significant relationships (or even exes?) and find out what works--and what went wrong.

The house containing the North Node shows the experiences that allow the person to access this new psychological awareness...The South Node position in a chart (located at the point exactly opposite of the North Node) depicts an aspect in our character that has been overemphasized in past lives, and thus tends to take over the personality in this lifetime and throw us off balance. When we are acting without awareness, we tend to 'act out' the South Node position in response to our environment because we have been accustomed to that approach working to our advantage. However, in this lifetime, our experiences show us that approaching a situation from the stance shown by the position of the Southern Node of our chart is no longer working...\\" -- Jan Spiller in Astrology For The Soul<br /><br />In her book Astrology for the Soul, astrologer Jan Spiller shows you the key to discovering your hidden talents, deepest desires, and the ways to avoid negative influences that may distract you from achieving your true life purpose, as revealed by the North Node of the Moon in your natal astrological chart. Although Spiller mostly uses the term North Node, she takes into consideration that the North Node exists in polarity with the South Node--and how they both manifest in our attitude, personality, and drive.<br /><br />To discover your North Node, you need to generate a chart. You can do this by going to Astro.com Once you enter the birth time, date, and place a chart will be generated. Chart Drawing, Ascendant is where generated charts are stored. To find your North Node (NN) look for the glyph (symbol) that looks like a horseshow with curlicues on the end. The South Node (NN) will be in the House directly opposite the North Node, although it won't be pictured. The symbol for the SN is an inversion of the NN glyph.

Your Goddess Sign will give you an even deeper knowledge of your spiritual purpose and your karma (or your own soul's pathway), while at the same time revealing fascinating insights into your relationships.\\" --Author Angelica Danton<br /><br />Like most people, I've been fascinated by systems designed to tell me more about myself: Why am I here? Why do I do the things I do? Am I unique...or are there others similar to me?<br /><br />In her brand new book Goddess Signs: Which One Are You?, author and professional astrologer Angelica Danton gives an original perspective on the link between Chinese astrology and goddess spirituality. Based on decades of research, she realized there was a fascinating correlation between the 12 animal signs of the Chinese Zodiac and the characteristics of ancient goddesses.<br /><br />Despite my fascination with new astrological and personality systems, I was skeptical about this book only because my Chinese animal sign (Dog) never seemed to fit me. I would go to Chinese restaurants, see the Chinese Zodiac on the paper placemat and think \\"Ugh. That is so not me!\\" So when I read the beginning of this book and saw that there were five goddess types (Moon, Sun, Earth, Warrior, and Dark Goddess) I thought I'll look up my birthday on the chart, and if I'm not a Moon Goddess, I'm not reading any further...especially if I'm supposedly an Earth Goddess! (Hey, I'm not going to spend my time reading a book that doesn't even fit me...let alone write a review on it!) Somehow, I intuitively felt that I was a Moon Goddess. In fact, when I read another book several months ago that described several Goddesses, I felt an immediate connection to Selene (a Moon Goddess.)<br /><br />So I took a gander at the chart in the book, and I was, in fact, a Moon Goddess Sign! If that author got that right (I thought), maybe I'll finally get some insight on what it means to be a Dog! And sure enough, I did. More on that later, though...<br /><br />The introduction to this book has a brief description of the 5 Goddess types, including examples of famous women that personify a type and their patron goddesses. Here's the breakdown of Goddess types and Chinese animals:<br /><br />Moon Goddess Women Goat, Dog, Cat<br />Sun Goddess Women Dragon and Rooster<br />Earth Goddess Pig and Ox<br />Warrior Goddess Tiger and Horse<br /><br />Dark Goddess Rat, Monkey, Snake<br /><br />Each of the 12 animal signs are given a thorough overview detailing the following areas of each type:<br /><br />*Love<br />*Health<br />*Finances<br />*As a child<br />*Career<br />*Life in the 21st century<br />*Spirituality<br />*Ritual work<br /><br />I have to say that 80% of the descriptions for my type fit me. The only parts that didn't fit were financial (I'm a spender...not a saver!), and some of the relationship elements. But now I understand where the \\"loyalty\\" fits in: that trait of the Dog always threw me for a loop, because I never considered myself particularly loyal. (You have to be trusting for that, and while I assume good intentions with others, I keep people at an emotional distance.) She explains that Dogs are loyal to their chosen family, which makes perfect sense to me. She even filled in the blanks about the emotional detachment, especially as a Metal Dog. (Metals are intellectuals and usually have the ability to detach well.) The author also gives an overview of the other elements: Wood, Earth, Water, Fire. As you can see, there are layers of complexity that you can use to get greater insight into your animal/goddess Sign.<br /><br />For each Chinese animal sign, the author lists other correlations including Tarot card, Moon phase, celestial bodies, colors, crystals and gems, incense, herbs/plants, and more. Associated goddesses are described in greater depth, and numerological correlations are also listed. (For example, you reduce your birth number, and compare it to a chart.) If that's not enough, you also get a list of about 20 Positive Traits for each type, and 20 Negative Traits. Again, I found this to be very accurate. Finally, there is a compatability chart for each sign, rituals and tools, and a meditation unique to that sign's spiritual growth. For example, the meditation for Dog Women are for new friends.<br /><br />At 265 pages, this book is chock-full of helpful information. And men, you're not left out, either! There is a section devoted to God Signs of men, including famous contemporary examples ncluding the likes of Keanu Reeves, Tobey Maguire, Johnny Depp, J.R.R. Tolkien, Peter Jackson, Bono, and more!) There is even a paragraph devoted for each of the possible combination of Goddess and God signs.<br /><br />One thing that I am confused about, however: it's my understanding that there is a Rabbit and Sheep in the Chinese Zodiac. I've never heard of a Goat or Cat in Chinese astrology. Judging from the birthdate chart, it seems that Rabbit correlates with Cat, and Sheep correlates with Goat in Danton's system.<br /><br />What I like most about this book is that it provides an original combination of Chinese animal sign and Goddess archetypes...something I've not seen before. A good deal of the information in the book was new to me, and I'm always delighted to stumble upon unfamiliar ideas--especially if the information is practical. You'll certainly learn more about yourself with this book, as well as how your animal sisters see the world.f that's not enough, you also get a list of about 20 Positive Traits for each type, and 20 Negative Traits.

Every book that I've read by Dr. Dyer has been a gift of encouragement, common sense, and clarity-and his 50 card deck Inner Peace Cards is no exception. As with most Hay House motivational decks, Inner Peace Cards are a high-gloss kaleidoscope of color and inspiration, measuring 4.12 x 4.13 inches. They come in a convenient flip-top box that is covered in illustrations...both inside and out.<br /><br />Dyer's purpose for these cards is to help you feel the love of God deep within you on a daily basis as you're guided to drawn upon the inner peace that lies within.<br /><br />I was having a particularly stressful day yesterday, and as I opened the box, there was a bright golden card that said: \\"Once you have learned how to enter your inner kingdom, you have a special retreat within that is always available to you.\\" I immediately felt a sense of peace. Sometimes, when the outside world seems to be crowding in, it only takes a small reminder that we have the kingdom of God within...and it can be accessed at any time.<br /><br />Each card is not only lavishly illustrated in every color imaginable, but also bears an inspirational phrase on both sides. Some of my favorites include:<br /><br />If you meet someone whose soul is not aligned with yours, send them love and move along. (I align myself with people who support my growth.)<br /><br />If you are suffering in your life right now, I can guarantee that this condition is tied up with some kind of attachment to how things should be going. (I release the need to determine how things \\"should\\" be.)<br /><br />One of the highest places you can get to is to be independent of the good opinions of others. (What other people think of me is none of my business.)<br /><br />You can't go around being what everyone wants you to be, living your life through other people's rules, and expect to be happy and have inner peace. (I live my life in my own way.)<br /><br />No one can create negativity or stress within you. Only you can do that by virtue of how you process your world. (I create the world that I live in.)<br /><br />I fill myself with love, and I send that love out into the world. How others treat me is their path; how I react is mine. (Love is my gift to the world.)<br /><br />As you can probably tell, these cards not only inspire, but also challenge us to examine our perspectives and the choices we are making. Leading us into a deeper, more mindful way of living, Inner Peace Cards are a wonderful way to re-connect with the Divine, our higher wisdom, and others.<br /><br />(To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])ound being what everyone wants you to be, living your life through other people's rules, and expect to be happy and have inner peace.

Are they archetypes in the collective unconscious? Are they the divine ideas of Plato and the neoplatonists?\\" --Martin Goldsmith, author of The Zodiac by Degrees - 360 New Symbols<br /><br />Astrology is the fascinating science and art that delves into who we are, why we are here, and why we do what we do. A lesser known component of Astrology is the degree symbols. When viewing an astrological chart, there are 360 tiny lines that intersect with the circumference. Each line is reprented by a degree, and there are 30 degrees within each Sign. Since there are 12 signs in the Zodiac, this adds up to 360 symbols. The degree symbols are not glyphs; rather, they are a symbolic picture of an individual's personal mythology and orientation.<br /><br />If you were to have a chart generated by software or somewhere online, you'd be given the specific natal location of the Sun, Moon, Ascendant, planets, and so on. You'd also be given the degree of the placement. For example, according to my natal chart, the Sun is in 14 degrees Scorpio and the Moon is 18 degrees Aquarius. Whether using an astrology book or a generated report, the most information you're usually given would be the meaning of the Moon in Aquarius in the 11th House.<br /><br />This is obviously more detailed and helpful than just an explanation for Moon in Aquarius! However, there is a discipline within Astrology that gets even more specific, and that is the realm of the 360 symbols. These ancient symbols are most commonly known as the Sabian symbols, but there are other symbolic systems that exist. Most Astrologers shy away from the 360 degree symbols, feeling that it only further complicates Astrology, or, that the Sabian symbols have been accurate at times, but largely hit-and-miss.<br /><br />Author Martin Goldsmith, Ph.D (history) has studied the symbols of the zodiac for more than 30 years and has done extensive research on planets, signs and houses. After examining thousands of charts he realized that the Sabian symbols were more positive and accurate than other symbol systems; however, some of them had, at best, only a tangential relationship to the Sabian symbols.<br /><br />In his new, 369-paged book The Zodiac By Degrees, Goldsmith offers an intriguing portrait of each of the 360 symbols. Mixing empirical research with intuition, he fills in the gaps and discrepancies outlined in the Sabian symbols--creating a whole new set of symbols. Astrologers will find this new book a fascinating addition to their interpretative tools, and the layman will discover a new way to see their astrological chart. You don't need to be an astrologer to use these symbols. Online, you can visit a site such as Astro.com to generate a free natal chart. (Scroll down to the section Chart Drawing, Ascendant.) Each degree in your chart is provided (e.g. Mars 11 Degrees Libra), so you can cross reference the degrees with the symbols in the book. If you're not sure of your exact birth time, your Ascendant (also known as rising sign) and House cusps may be off. However, the use of the descriptions of each symbol can be used to rectify your Ascendant.<br /><br />Each degree has a symbolic phrase, a paragraph of descriptive phrases, and a listing of famous examples and their occupation, milestones, reason for notoriety, roles played (on stage or in movies) and so on. For example, my Moon is in 18 (degree) Aquarius. The symbolic phrase is:<br /><br />An ominous silence falls as the last man at a masquerade party prepares to unmask. Outside, a thunderstorm is brewing.<br /><br />A few of the descriptive phrases:<br /><br />Exposing uncomfortable truths; unwillingness to relate on a phony, masky level (troublemakers, enjoy rattling people); bringing negative undertones to the surface and clearing the air; breaking through fears and doubts that isolate people from each other...)<br /><br />Just a few of the famous examples listed for this degree symbol include:<br /><br/>*Madame Blatavasky (Jupiter. Seeker, mystic, founder of Theosophical Society, wrote Isis Unveiled)<br />*Frida Kahlo (Chiron. Painter)<br />*Joseph Campbell (Saturn. Jungian anthropologist-The Masks Of God)<br />*Roseanne Barr (North Node. Brought social realism to the TV sitcom)<br /><br />The examples the author picks are specifically related to the symbol itself, which makes it much more interesting than \\"Roseanne Barr, actress\\".<br /><br />One might ask why bother with a interpretative system that isn't cut and dried like the rest of astrology? I believe the author answers this question quite well:<br /><br />\\"Imagistic astrology allows you to penetrate to the level of soul and spirit. Symbols are like 'windows to the soul', for, as religious thinkers have always known, symbols can put you in touch with the spiritual energies they represent. Keyword astrology, by contrast, has no real energy. When you read keywords, you begin and end by checking off points on a mental list--That's true; that's true; that's not true. Symbols have the power to engage your intuitive faculties. They help you make a direct connection with a person's basic spiritual energies and penetrate the private language of their personal mythology.\\"<br /><br />I have found the information on each symbol of my natal chart to be an amazingly accurate portrayal of the archetypal energies that have woven throughout my life.

In his new book The Paradox of Choice - Why More Is Less, Barry Choices. We're surrounded by them. Whether we're trying to pick out a new pair of jeans, shopping for car insurance, getting groceries, selecting a long-distance phone carrier, ordering a cup of coffee, or even deciding which spiritual path to follow, we're faced with a staggering amount of options. Just this weekend, my husband and I were shopping for a new dryer to replace the one that gave up the ghost. The amount of dryers was dizzying; they even had digital dryers! Like I jokingly told the salesman, when I do laundry, I don't want to have to do mathematical equations to figure out what numbers to key in...I just want to dry my freakin' clothes!<br /><br />The author contends that it's crucial for us to feel like we're in control, but in the face of so many options, is the process of selection back-firing on us?<br /><br />Schwartz contends that it is. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, the author shows how the dramatic explosion of choice--from the mundane to the profound--has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution. He tells the story of how he used to be able to go into a store and just get a pair of jeans. Being one to wear his jeans until they fall apart, he finally went to the store to get a new pair. A salesperson walked up to him and asked him if she could help. \\"I want a pair of jeans--32-38\\", he said. She proceeds to ask him if he wants them slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit, baggy, or extra baggy? Stonewashed, acid-washed, or distressed? Buttton-fly or zipper fly? Faded or regular?<br /><br />He was stunned. He sputtered that he just wanted regular jeans...you know, the kind that used to be the only kind? Schwartz then begins a mission to find out the range of choice for Americans. He goes on to list some pretty eye-opening statistics. For example, in his local supermarket, he found 285 varieties of cookies. Just the chocolate-chip cookies alone had 21 options! At his local electronics store, he counted 85 different telephones, not including cell phones. Even shopping for colleges has become an intellectual shopping mall.<br /><br />And speaking of malls, did you know that Americans go to shopping centers about once a week, more often than they go to houses of worship? American now has more shopping centers than high schools. However, when asked to rank the pleasure they get from various activities, grocery shopping ranks next to last, and other shopping fifth from the bottom.<br /><br />People are shopping more, but enjoying it less. But why? If they do enjoy it less, why do they keep doing it? This is the crux of the book, where Schwartz cites fascinating studies including Why Choice Is Demotivating. He also examines why it is that the excitement of purchasing new items seems to wear off so fast, and why we sometimes actually feel badly about our choices. For one, humans are adaptive. \\"Familiarity breeds contempt\\", as the old adage goes. But it's also the fact that we second guess ourselves after a purchase, mulling what we could have chosen, as well as asking ourselves if we really chose \\"the best\\".<br /><br />Choosing \\"the best\\" is a trait of maximizers. Schwartz says that maximizers tend to be less happy than satisficers. Satisficers are those who choose with the mindset of \\"good enough\\". But because America is a culture where many seek \\"the best\\" and compare their choices and lifestyle with their neighbors and media standards, most of us are maximizers.<br /><br />What are some of the qualities of a maximizer?<br /><br />1. Maximizers engage in more product comparisons than satisficers, both before and after they make purchasing decisions.<br />2. Maximizers take longer than satisficers to decide on a purchase.<br />3. Maximizers spend more time than satisficers comparing their purchasing decisions to the decisions of others.<br />4. Maximizers are more likely to experience regret after a purchase.<br />5. Maximizers aremore likely to spend time thinking about hypothetical alternatives to the purchases they've made.<br />6. Maximizers generally feel less positive about their purchasing decisions.<br />7. Maximizers savor positive events less than satisficers and do not cope as well (by their own admission) with negative events.<br />8. After something bad happens to them, maximizers' sense of well-being takes longer to recover.<br />9. Maximizers tend to brood or ruminate more than satisficers.<br /><br />Is it any wonder that we buy more, but enjoy less? What drew me to this book was because I knew that I was the type of person that obsessed over purchases, taking forever to select an item. I used to be so indecisive at a restaurant, taking 20 minutes to figure out what I wanted! What am I in the mood for? How will I feel when I eat it? What's the tastiest thing I could order? I'm much better than I was, but still... I also noticed the trend to second guess many of my purchasing decisions and wondering if I could \\"do better\\".<br /><br />So when I read about this book in Parade magazine, I ordered it from Amazon.com. The great thing about this book is that Schwartz synthesizes current research, and shows how eliminating choices can greatly reduce the stress, anxiety, and busyness of our lives. He even offers eleven practical steps on how to limit choices to a manageable number, have the discipline to focus on those that are important and ignore the rest, and ultimately derive greater satisfaction from the choices we have to make.<br /><br />Oh, and I picked my new dryer rather easily. I knew I wanted an interior light, a manual dial, large capacity, and a signal to let me know when the clothes were done. However, my husband kept standing there with a \\"deer in the headlights\\" look. (And finally agreed with my choice.)<br /><br />Do you think locking him in our bathroom with this book might help? Not a lotta choices in there, after all...urchases they've made.  6. Maximizers generally feel less positive about their purchasing decisions.  7.

Nap On!	\\"Your real vision is immeasurably valuable and I dare you to let it out! Let us all see what you have made real from your dreams and imaginations. We are waiting to see.\\" --SARK (Susan Ariel Rainbow Kennedy)<br /><br />I own and have reviewed many inspirational decks, but I have never seen one like the Juicy Living Cards! I had never heard of SARK (Susan Ariel Rainbow Kennedy) until a few weeks ago, but the women who were talking about her work were absolutely gushing. \\"Who is this woman with a funny name?\\", I thought.<br /><br />Now I know.<br /><br />SARK is an artist and author of 11 books, and has produced more than 200 products to inspire creative living. She believes in inviting someone dangerous to tea, eating mangoes naked, and living juicy.<br /><br />What is living juicy, you may ask? According to one of her brightly colored water-color cards: Living Juicy Means: rolling down a bright grassy hill, sleeping all day to stay in a dream, definitely taking your shoes off at the beach. Buying flowers that make you gasp. Find those places inside you that jump for joy and do things that bring out your best, most magic self!<br /><br />The text on the 50 cards in this delightful deck look like hand written script, and the illustrations are either lush watercolors or whimsical cartoons (the cards are a matte finish). Some words are even circled (you know, like we did when we were kids when passing a note to a classmate in order to emphasize the importance of a word), and accompany gorgeous watercolor illustrations. Every card is different. I laughed out loud at a few of the cards (\\"You are a delicious succulent human bean\\"), and sorted my favorites to include in this review.<br /><br />It was over half the deck.<br /><br />I can't exactly share all of the delightful gems of wisdom, wonderment, and inspiration on these cards, but I can share a few!<br /><br />One card shows an outline of a figure in bed, with Let Sleep Heal You on the blanket. When you turn the card over, there's a blue/green/purple water-color wash with We Are Not The Things We Do written in pale yellow.<br /><br />Another card features a blue and purple watercolor border, depicting a clothesline. On the line hangs \\"cozy socks\\", \\"perfect pillow\\", \\"lucky pajamas\\", and \\"magic blanket\\". Underneath are the words Our lives are filled with gorgeous moments, the smell of clothes dried in the sun is one of these. Relax, and let moments like these seep into your soul. On the back of the card, a whimsical cup with rising steam says Measure Time By Mugs Of Tea.<br /><br />A smiling blond woman holding a bouquet says I bring you gorgeous flowers to stand beside your gorgeous self on yet another card--the back awash in gentle green with the pale yellow words Go to where you want to be, and the resources will follow.<br /><br />One of my favorites is a \\"prayer pie\\" that says:<br /><br />May you unfold willingly<br />May you be truly nourished<br />May peace be in your every step<br />May gratitude fill you<br />May you reach others with your radiant heart<br /><br />Sometimes, we just don't give ourselves permission to let out the magical child within, let alone to love imperfectly, rest, and \\"eat impossibly delicious cake\\" (that's what you eat when you invite someone dangerous to tea, you see).<br /><br />If you find it difficult to give yourself permission to sing a song of surrender, stop doing (just for right now), dance with color, relax, risk the healing, play outside, take a leap of faith, or write your life so that others may be illuminated, then let SARK do it for you with these uplifting cards.<br /><br />(To see 6 images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])ot The Things We Do written in pale yellow.

If you find it difficult to give yourself permission to sing a song of surrender, stop doing (just for right now), dance with color, relax, risk the healing, play outside, take a leap of faith, or write your life so that others may be illuminated, then let SARK do it for you with these uplifting cards.

Think of them as the guardian angels' managers. Archangels are messengers from the Creator to the created, who help us with every area of our lives. They protect us and guide us, bringing about peace on Earth, one person at a time. Because they're so powerful, archangels also motivate us to take action. The archangels have no time or space restrictions, so they can simultaneously be with everyone who calls upon them. Archangels can have unique, personalized experiences and exchanges with all of us.&#34; --Doreen Virtue, Ph.D<br /><br />Doreen Virtue, a clairvoyant metaphysician who works with the angelic and elemental realms in her writing and workshops, has just released a brand new deck Archangel Oracle Cards. Although I am familiar with Dr. Virtue's work with the angelic realm and have heard many glowing reviews of her other angelic oracle decks, I hadn't personally experienced them for myself until now. I wasn't sure what to expect, because I've never really been into angels. Sure, I'm familiar with Gabriel and Michael, as any student of the Bible would be. But I suppose I never saw the point of asking angels for help or guidance when I could go directly to the Boss.<br /><br />In analytical &#34;reviewer&#34; mode, I carefully opened the clear plastic wrap encasing the box. I took out the guidebook that accompanied the deck, and went straight for the cards. What I didn't expect was to be profoundly touched by the images on the cards, the names of the angels, and the messages from each. As I slowly viewed each card, I felt a heavenly presence surround me, and it was as if the eyes of each angel were looking right through me, speaking directly to me the messages on each of the cards. As the New Testament would say, I truly felt surrounded by &#34;a great cloud of witnesses&#34;--a Heavenly Host.<br /><br />I came to the Indigo and Crystal Children card, which shows a beautiful angel clad in seafoam green with green and pink wings. This was the Archangel Metatron, and his message was: &#34;You have a bond with children. In particular, you can help children who are sensitive.&#34; I immediately felt a bond with this angel, and asked him to help me as I love, nurture, and guide my Crystal son. (For more information, see my article Who Are The Indigos and Crystals?)<br /><br />I felt such peace and such love from these cards which features the vibrant, celestial images from nine different artists. Doreen has specifically chosen artwork that portrays the way she clairvoyantly sees each angel. Each of the 15 angels are based on traditions spanning Jewish, Cabalistic, Christian, Catholic, and Islamic spiritual practices, texts, and beliefs. There are 3 cards for each angel, for a total of 45 cards. In addition to a key word or phrase, there is a short message, as well.<br /><br />The back of the cards are framed with a narrow, golden water-color border. The center of the card is a beautiful angel standing on the tip of a golden mountain, holding an emanating torch in one hand, and a lattice sphere in the other. Behind her is a sky of blues, violets, and indigos, dotted with pinprick stars with a quiet rainbow in the background.<br /><br />In the 79 page booklet that accompanies the deck, further elaboration is made on each card, including an additional message from the angel, and how to work with him or her. In some cases, recommendations for specific crystals associated with the angel is given, as well as his or her aura color. The booklet also details the different ways you may use The Archangel Oracle Cards, including reading methods such as spreads, using an pendulum, and selecting cards clairvoyantly or intuitively.<br /><br />Last night, I shuffled and decided to pick one card for inspiration/meditation and asked &#34;What do I need to know right now?&#34;. A bubble of mirth arose from my belly when I picked a card bearingthe kindly, wizened face of the Archangel Uriel. The message? You Know What To Do. &#34;Trust your inner knowledge, and act upon it without delay.&#34; I couldn't help but laugh, and felt that this gentle, playful angel was laughing with me.<br /><br />Whether you use these cards to read for yourself or someone else, your Archangel can be called upon to ease your troubles and guide you towards intuitive thought and empowered action. In the Greek, the word &#34;angel&#34; comes from a word that means &#34;messenger&#34;, and these cards can help you connect with these Divine messengers that are sent to protect, embrance, and comfort. The Archangels are happy to help you with your concerns, and you needn't say a formal invocation, have religious training, or live a &#34;perfect&#34; life to get their attention.<br /><br />I know that I feel more intimately connected with the angelic realm after using these cards, and I look forward to a continuing relationship with these special messengers from the Divine.<br /><br />(To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at JanetBoyer.com)w What To Do. &#34;Trust your inner knowledge, and act upon it without delay.&#34; I couldn't help but laugh, and felt that this gentle, playful angel was laughing with me.

Poignant images of gentle beauty and human frailty came from a time of violence, pestilence, and oppression. These images speak to me of a truth that is timeless, and hope that flowers even in the darkest conditions. It is my hope that they speak to you as well.\\" -- Kat Black, creator of The Golden Tarot.<br /><br />I have never been drawn to traditional Tarot decks, especially those fashioned after the Rider-Waite. Rather, I tend to go for the funky, the symbolic, and the high tech. One of the reasons for my preference is because modern life seems so far removed from the period in which traditional Tarot was created.<br /><br />So I wasn't sure what to expect from Kat Black's Golden Tarot. I knew nothing about the deck, other than people were giving it high praise. When I opened the sturdy box with the lid that comes off the top, I was intrigued that therein was a deck with gilded edges. Remmeber your Grandmother's Bible? The one who's pages shined so brightly when closed? This luxurious deck has that same gilt edging. The cards follows traditional Tarot, with 78 cards total. The Minor Arcana is fully illlustrated like the Majors. The images are printed on heavy cardboard with a matte golden border. The back is a tapestry of subdued shades of camel and rust. You can't tell from the backs if a card is upright or reversed.<br /><br />The most unsual aspect of Golden Tarot is that deck creator Kat Black has digitally collaged images from various lesser-known paintings from a period she calls International Gothic. This period of time, 1200-1500 A.D., evolved into the Reniassance. She deliberately avoided using art by well-known artists such as da Vinci and Michelangelo, and most of the paintings used for the deck are hanging in European churches. (A sight that most of us will never see!)<br /><br />The collaged images are so seamless, that I didn't know I was looking at a digitally collaged deck until I read the 200 page bound booklet included in the package. I even showed my artist husband, and he had no idea, either! The images on the cards are truly breathtaking. I feel like I'm looking at a masterpiece with each and every one. I'm sure that Ms. Black intends this deck to actually be read not just admired as an art deck, but they're so gorgeous I'm reluctant to read with them! (So don't expect information on how they read...I'm too busy drooling over the images!)<br /><br />The high-quality booklet not only contains the standard meanings for the images (upright and reversed), but also Appendices that list every part that was digitally collaged and the painting that it came from. The Hermit is one of the cards that I look at first when checking out a new deck, and its rendering in this deck resonated deeply with me: it's a picture of a gray-bearded St. Francis of Assisi standing in a darkened forest. A deer is at his side, he's holding a latern that gives off little light, and a gray cat is chasing a quail. The man's body and deer, the latern, the forest, the head, quail, and cat all come from different sources. As I mentioned, you cannot tell that this picture is collaged! An amazing technological feat indeed.<br /><br />Kat Black mentions that this version of the Golden Tarot took 1,500 hours to produce. This deck was originally web-only, but fans of her work urged her to create an actual deck. Tarot enthusiasts and deck collectors alike will be much richer for having Black's breath-taking creation in hand.<br /><br />(To see 10 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)til I read the 200 page bound booklet included in the package.

The meditations in this book are designed to connect with that center and magnify our understanding of life. When we are willing to open our consciousness to new ideas and new ways of thinking about issues, then our lives change for the better.&quot; (From the book)<br />Have you noticed that the way you begin the day often sets the tone for the experences that will follow, as well as how we will react to them? A great way to start the day with positive thoughts is Louise Hay's book Inner Wisdom - Meditations For the Heart and Soul. Hay shares uplifting gems of wisdom that are sure to encourage and inspire you. As with many Hay House titles, this book is full of colorful illustrations and text. Some pages have affirmations such as I breathe in love, and I flow with life, I relase all feelings of guilt, and I create wonderful new beliefs for myself. Most of the pages, however, contain wisdom like:<br />&quot;Am I expanding or contracting? When I expand my thinking, my beliefs, and everything about me, the love flows freely. When I contract, I put up walls and shut myself off. If I am frightened or threatened or feel that something is just not right, I begin to breathe. Breathing opens me up. It straightens my spine. It opens my chest. It gives my heart room to expand. By practicing breathing, I drop the barriers and begin to open up. It is a beginning point. Instead of going into total panic, I take a few breaths and ask myself: Do I want to contract, or do I want to expand?<br />One page has the affirmation I perceive my true being with colorful flowers below. The meditation that accompanies it says:<br />&quot;I see myself having a consciousness of oneness with the presence and power of God. My wisdom and understanding of Spirit increases, and I express the inner beauty and strength of my true being. Divine order is ever-present in my experience, and there is plenty of time for all that I choose to do. I express wisdom, understanding, and love in all of my dealings with others, and my words are Divinely guided. I see myself expressing the creative energy of Spirit in my work, my writing, and my speech. Fun, uplifting ideas flow through my consciousness, and I follow through on the ideas received, bringing them into full manifestation.&quot;<br />Whether using these words of wisdom at the start of the day, during a mid-day retreat, or before you go to bed, you're thoughts will begin to calm and your spirit will feel refreshed. I highly recommend this 101 page book, especially if you desire guidance, wisdom, strength, and peace.<br />&quot;Remember, in the vast infinity of life, all is perfect, whole, and complete...and so are you.&quot;or all that I choose to do.

Tunuri, an inquistive and adventurous Huichol youth, is making a trip to the sacred mountain with the families of his village. A beautiful butterfly catches his attention, and he follows it over many hills and through the forest. Tunuri looks around and realizes that he couldn't see or hear anyone. He is lost.<br />Something catches Tunuri's eye, and he notices a unusual deer walking toward him which seemed to glow from inside. He knew that this deer was no ordinary animal--the coat was a lovely deep blue color! Magical Blue Deer introduces itself, and tells Tunuri that it knows where his family is. He beckons Tunuri to follow, and wherever the deer stepped, colorful flowers began to grow. Blue Deer leads Tunuri on a journey where he meets Father Sun, Brother Wind, Sister Water, Mother Earth, and Grandfather Fire. Grandfather Fire assures Tunuri that he is never truly alone, even if lost, and gives Tunuri a special task: to share all that he had learned that day with everyone he knows and meets.<br />The Huichol Indians are among the last of the world's indigenous cultures that have been able to maintain their way of life and spiritual traditions into this new millenium. They live in remote regions of the Sierra Madre Mountains of western Mexico, and although some communities can be reached by car, many of them are still isolated by mountainous terrain. The Huichol have a rich, nature-based spiritual tradition, and The Journey of Tunuri and the Blue Deer is a modern adaptation of one of their traditional stories. Two of the most important elements of the Huichol spiritual tradition is the sacred Blue Deer and the sacred cactus, hikuri, and this book reflects the teaching of how a boy or girl finds his or her task in life by connecting with the powers of nature through their help.<br />Each page of this captivating book is filled with full-color pictures of yarn drawings made by Maria and Casimiro, two Huichol artists. This unique art form is made by spreading bees wax on a piece of wood, and then placing many colors of yarn in intricate patterns. Each drawing takes many hours to complete, requiring enormous amounts of patience, skill, and artistic vision. Maria and Caismiro teach this special technique to younger members of the Huichol community to keep this artistic tradition alive.<br />In addition to the inspiring tale and gorgeous yarn art, this book also contains information about the Huichol, their sacred symbols, and how each yarn drawing for the book was made.<br />This book is great for younger children because the colorful pictures and lyrical prose will hold their attention. The vibrant art work and unfolding mystery of Tunuri's journey will captivate older children, as well. The Journey of Tunuri and the Blue Deer would make a wonderful addition to any library, especially for learning about contemporary indigenous culture and nature-based spirituality.

He was also a survivor of the Nazi prison camp of Dachau. Painting The Dream shares Paladin's wisdom and poetry, as well as color plates of his vibrant, visionary art. David Chethlahe Paladin's art was his life; through it, he fulfilled his desire to serve, to heal, to live compassionately, and to walk the Navajo way of beauty. This remarkable book explores the connection between Paladin's public art and his private life, showing how he not only honored his spiritual ancestors but also his personal commitments through the art that he gave to humanity.<br />At the age of 14, Paladin was a runaway adventurer in the South Pacific. He and a buddy stowed away on a ship, where he met a German named Ted Keck. While at sea, Paladin sketched what he saw, including the Japanese preparing for an invasion. When the war started, the American goverment became very interested in Paladin's sketches, and eventually acquried them. Paladin was then drafted, but instead of going to the South Pacific, they used him as a decoder; the Germans couldn't understand Navajo, and Paladin used this language to transfer information. Caught wearing a German officer's uniform, Paladin was captured and sentenced to death for spying.<br />As destiny would have it, Paladin came face to face with his sailing buddy, Ted Keck, who was now a German officer. Keck exchanged Paladin's identity tags with another prisoner, so Paladin was sent to a work camp rather than the death chamber.<br /> Having endured starvation, exposure in freezing temperatures, and other atrocities like having his feet nailed to the floor, the worse memory of all for Chethlehe was of a German officer that would put maggots on the open sores of his legs and who shoved raw chicken entrails down his throat. He was very bitter and angry at this guard, but something changed during the Nuremburg War Crimes Trial. After he testified to what this guard did to him, another man asked for permission to address the court. While not intending to defend the officer, the man explained that the maggots would eat the gangrenous flesh, allowing new flesh to grow--and that in Paladin's weakened state, raw entrails was one of the few things he would be able to assimilate and draw nourishment from. Paladin writes of his experience:<br />\\"The impact of these words were shattering. I broke down in tears as I released the years of bitterness I had harbored toward that officer. I made a silent oath to myself never again to hate or condemn another person.<br />In my experience as a German prisoner of war I learned much about the inhumanity of man to man, and also much about love, sharing, and attempts to reach out. It was frightening to see how low we could sink as individuals, but it is wrong to say that the Germans or any one group were particularly cruel. We were all experiencing, in one way or another, something that we needed to experience--our own ability to hate, our own ability to be 'inhuman', whether we were Americans or Germans. And yet, in the prison camps I met many people--Catholics, Gypsies, Jews--who each shared a little bit of their truth, their love, their myths with me in order that I might somehow survive.<br />Today, I am committed to inclusiveness. I believe that it is possible for us to accept and honor the beliefs of others, to sing with joy their songs of praise, to learn from their faith, and to grow with them.\\"<br />Paladin was a decorated hero before the age of 20, but he still felt confusion and despair, especially because he was crippled from his Dauchau experience. He went back to the reservation, before the council of elders. According to Paladin, they gave him hydrotherapy, Indian-style. The tied a rope around his waist, removed his prosthetic appliances, and threw him into the Little Colorado River at flood stage. He was angry at them, but recognized the wisdom of their actions. They forced him to use his body in new ways in order to survive, and in doing so, he called back his spirit. He realized his strength and his power, and was born anew.<br />A shaman as well as an artist, Paladin was one of the first Native American painters to move beyond traditional themes and styles of painting. Using various mediums such as acrylics, clay, and sand, Paladin painted Navajo, Pueblo, Huichol, and Egyptian deities; Aboriginal Dreamtime images; and mythological beings born of the imagination and lore of many ages and lands, Paladin's art has been praised for its exuberance, eclecticism, spirituality, and original use of symbols. Together, his prose and paintings illuminate a philosophy in which we are all creators and transformers when we respond with openness to our environment and our fellow beings.<br />When at the Chicago Art Institute in the 1940's, Paladin met the Russian artist marc Chagall. Chagall used to say to him \\"You have this beautiful heritage. Tell me some stories.\\", and then \\"As an Indian, why don't you just go to sleep and paint what you dream? Paint those beautiful stories!\\" According to Paladin, those words meant more to him than anything else in his life. It gave him a direction to explore with his art.<br />I was never a fan of Native American or Aztec-type art, but after reading of Paladin's experiences in his own words, as well as beholding his beautiful spirit and life, his art has taken on new meaning for me. I can't stop looking at his vibrant art that is so uniquely rich and alive with meaning.

The size of the cards are 5.5 inches long and 3.5 inches wide--the exact same size as the Archetype Cards by Myss. Artist Janice Fried illustrated both decks, as well; in fact, I couldn't help but wonder when looking at the Healing Cards if some of the images were originally intended for the Archetype deck. The image from one of the Healing Cards is the exact same one that's on the front of the newer version of Myss' Journal Of Inner Dialogue.<br /><br />According to the authors, these healing cards and accompanying booklet will help you create a daily practice that not only heals existing ailments, but also maintains spiritual balance in your life. Healing Cards offer both inspiration and a course of action and (according to them) a card a day keeps the doctor away!<br /><br />Cute marketing...but does the deck live up to its claim?<br /><br />I felt that the best way to review this deck would be to use it during times where I was in a position to receive healing--when I was dealing with sinus problems, fatigue, and bouts of IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). So I used this deck over a period of months for those times of stillness where I welcomed Guidance concerning dis-ease.<br /><br />Each time I sought insight, as well as comfort, I'd say a prayer, shuffle the deck, and draw a card. While a few of the cards contained quiet wisdom and inspiration, I didn't feel that they spoke to me on a deep level. At other times, the cards seemed almost accusatory. For example, one card says The root cause of all disease is a negative attitude about taking care of yourself. The booklet expands on this card saying \\"The Ayurvedic tradition of India teaches that the main reason we get sick can be reduced to a lazy or perverse mental attitude, which leads us to ignore the basic principles of good health...\\". Yet another card says All suffering stems from ignorance, hatred, or craving; the wisdom connected with this card says \\"...Passionate craving for material or sensual satisfaction inevitably leads to frustration and disappointment, which in turn leads to stress and illness.\\"<br /><br />However, other cards convey messages contradictory to the \\"it's your fault\\" message. For example, Illness is not a punishment, but a stimulation to life. The wisdom in the booklet corresponding with this card says \\"A large part of the suffering that accompanies any illness derives from the psychologically imposed belief that it represents a judgment. Some may believe it's a judgment from God, a punishment for bad deeds committed in this life or previous lifetimes, or even an unconscious choice we've made. None of those reasons has any more validity than saying a wild deer is responsible for developing a cancerous tumor...But looking on it [illness] as a punishment is counterproductive, since the implicit guilt can only create more stress.\\" Then it goes on to talk about Friedrich Nietzsche and his idea of seeing illness as a great stimulant to life and how this is a far more empowering way to look at dis-ease: \\"In this case, his thoughts offer a far more wholesome understanding of illness than that of many traditional and New Age thinkers.\\"<br /><br />Indeed. I couldn't agree more.<br /><br />I see this dichotomy among many New Age teachers: the idea that we're responsible for our own sickness and that we created it. Yet, in the next breath, we're admonished not to feel guilt about it because we may not be responsible for it after all. And then we're given a neat little ABC package of formulas designed to eradicate dis-ease and be perfectly healthy 100% of the time.<br /><br />I'm reminded of this portion of the New Testament: \\"As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth. His disciples asked him, 'Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?' 'Neither this man nor his parents sinned,' said Jesus, 'but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.'\\" (John9:1-3).<br /><br />The wisdom shared in the booklet spans many religious traditions: Buddhism, Native American, Shamanism, Judaism, Christianity, Ayurveda, Islam and so on. Yet, I felt like it was more an intellectual lesson in comparative religion rather than a deck constructed to foster healing.gious traditions: Buddhism, Native American, Shamanism, Judaism, Christianity, Ayurveda, Islam and so on.

Let me just start out by saying that I love this deck. It has captured my imagination and my spirit, and presently I find myself reaching for this fresh, vibrant deck before any other.<br /><br />Bringing the mystical tradition of Tarot firmly into the 21st century, The Oracle Tarot by Lucy Cavendish is a bright, colorful, positive and feminine deck that exudes \\"girl power\\". You will not find any frightening images or meanings in this deck, so there's no need to feel apprehensive of the messages contained therein. Some people have never delved into the mysterious and profound world of Tarot precisely because of cards like Death, The Devil, and The Tower. However, in The Oracle Tarot Death is re-named Change and The Devil is re-named Bondage. Although upbeat and positive, this is not a \\"fluff\\" deck; I guarantee you that outmoded or negative thinking patterns and behavior will be challenged by the messages in these cards!<br /><br />Instead of a straightforward deck where the 10 of Swords would be merely depicted as 10 interlocking swords, Cavendish has created a visual allegory for every single card. The stunning, hand-painted artwork of Melinda Ayre adds so much pizzazz to the images; I'm reminded of the wetly vibrant oil-painted images in the movie What Dreams May Come.<br /><br />An intriguing aspect of The Oracle Tarot is that there are no court cards. I've never been attached to the court cards, and for me, they've seemed redundant in readings--so I was happy to see a deck without them, quite frankly. Another name change besides the ones already mentioned is The Hierophant being re-named Tradition.<br /><br />The thick, glossy cards measure 1.61 x 5.50 x 3.84 inches, come in a sturdy, high-gloss box, and are accompanied by a 69 page instruction booklet with a few pages in the back expressly for notes. Each card contains a key word or words written in white on the outer edges of the image. The backs of the cards are a gorgeous mix of blues and greens, with shimmering stars in a diagonal swathe.<br /><br /> The Cups suit are teacups and the way they are incorporated into the images is very inventive. For example, for the 2 of Cups, two people are seated facing one another at a small table. It looks as though they are playing footsies under the table, and that they are doing a \\"cheers\\" with their red mugs. The steam swirls from each mug, almost forming a heart. The keywords are Loving union, teamwork.<br /><br />The Coins suit is just as inventive. The 9 of Coins depicts a smartly dressed woman in profile, striding downhill. Her violet dress features 4 yellow disks on the hem, her purse clasp is a yellow disk, 2 are on her shoe straps, 1 is an earring, and 1 is the top of her hat. (9 total) The strings that flow from her hat turn into dollar signs, and the keyword of  this card is Good fortune. For the 10 of Coins, 9 yellow disks form the border of a pool where a woman sits lounging in a bikini--a drink on the table beside her. The brightly glowing sun makes 10. The 3 of Cups is a woman in a blue dress atop a skateboard with 3 yellow disks for wheels. The keywords are Purposeful action.<br /><br />And the Wands and Swords? Also very cleverly portrayed. The 6 of Wands shows a woman blowing out 6 candles (wands) on a birthday cake. The keywords are Wisdom of experience. For the 8 of Swords, a white-haired woman in a green dress sits before a steaming cup of soup with a spoon in her hands. Eight swords are painted on the borders of the image. The keywords are Caring for yourself.<br /><br />It's always nice to see a deck creator take so much time and care with the Minor Arcana--something that often seems like a mere afterthought in some decks.<br /><br />The Major Arcana is just as gorgeous. The Chariot, a card that keeps popping up in my own readings, features a woman in a crimson dress and high heels with one hand on a shopping cart and the other formed into a pumping fist. She sports a sassy smile, as well as a heart tattoo on her upper arm. The keywords for this card are The inspired warrior. Change (the card formerly known as Death) features a nude, winged woman emerging from a cocoon. The keywords are Release the past. The Sun portrays a nude woman whose long orange and gold hair flows upward, spiraling and morphing into a sun above her head. The keywords for this card are Awards, camaraderie, affection.<br /><br />I have been getting amazing readings and insights from this deck. I primarily use it for personal meditation and journaling. With fresh, empowering images, this deck inspires, illuminates, and expands self-knowing. I'm sure it would do the same in readings for other people, as well. I admit, I was put-off at first by the images of perky breasts and nude women, but somehow this deck kept calling to me. I'm so glad I gave The Oracle Tarot a chance, and that I heeded it's gentle call to my spirit. As I'm now beginning my journey into The Goddess, these cards have provided me with extra comfort and direction.<br /><br />This deck would be perfect for those just beginning working with Tarot--and for those seeking a more modern, accessible, and positive approach to this mysterious and sacred art.<br /><br />(To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)ange (the card formerly known as Death) features a nude, winged woman emerging from a cocoon.

US	49524801	R20KJZOVOQGNU5	1401902294	362915928	The Crystal Children	Books	5	54	74	N	N	An Insightful and Comforting Book	According to author Doreen Virtue, Crystal Children are the new generation that has come to the Earth plane after the Indigo children. They are approximately ages newborn to age 5, although some members of the first wave of Crystal children are as old as 7. These kids are like Indigos--highly psychic and sensitive--but without the dark edge and the anger energy.<br /><br />Crystal Children have auras that are bright, radiant, and opalescent--they seem to glow from the inside. They talk about distant galaxies, past lives, and have profound insights about love and peace.<br /><br />Virtue details quite a few patterns with Crystal Children, including their affinity for plants, trees, rocks, and the elderly. She also noticed that not only were the Crystal Children highly spiritually sensitive, but so were their parents. She believes that the souls of Crystals were obviously selecting moms and dads who could raise them in a spiritually nurturning environment. Also common among Crystals are their intense, wide-eyed stare. When their eyes lock onto yours, it's as if a high-level being is scanning you.<br /><br />One thing that I found especially encouraging about this book is the author's critique of labelling children autistic. Many Crystals are labelled autistic, but there are glaring differences. Autistics don't notice others--they are in their own world. Crystals, although often late-talkers, are usually very loving, cuddling, and social. Virtue writes:<br /><br />\\"Does speaking or reading later than expected warrant such a serious diagnosis? Why not call these sensitive children 'late-talkers' instead of pathologizing them with psychiatric diagnoses and making them feel ashamed of themselves? Hundreds of parents around the globe have submitted stories for this book, telling about their Crystal Children who 'took their sweet time' to begin speaking. Perhaps instead of labeling this phenomenon 'an epidemic of autism', as the media and medical establishment has done, we should examine it for indications of humankind's evolution. Who knows--maybe we don't need speaking anymore!\\"<br /><br />If you're thinking \\"Well, the author is probably one of those New Age flakes that has no clue about psychology. Of course she'd think it was some cosmic evolution instead of a very real disability!\\", I would answer that Virtue has a B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. in counseling psychology.<br /><br />This information was especially comforting to me as a mom, because my son was diagnosed with autism/PDD-NOS in 2001. Yet, he defies traditional autistic behaviors--but fits the Crystal Children descriptions 100%.<br /><br />The Crystal Children covers many issues that affect these special kids, including healing abilities, connections to nature, eating habits, and so on. Also included in this helpful book are interviews with the Crystal Children themselves, as well as their parents and teachers.<br /><br />Whether you are a parent, grandparent, teacher, relative, or an individual interested in bringing healing to the planet, Virtue's book points the way to help keep these Crystal Children happy and healthy, and how to avoid the pitfalls that could spoil their precious gifts. I highly recommend this book for these reasons--and for the encouragement, instruction and peace of mind this information can bring to parents and educators.<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of [[ASIN:1571745874 The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present]] (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)ons of humankind's evolution.

I've been wanting a nice Tarot bag, but didn't know where to go. Happily, Llewellyn makes a beautiful bag and you can get it through Amazon.com! (Great for rural-dwellers like myself, wouldn't you say?)<br />This bag is 100% black cotton velvet, with a purple satin lining and purple tassels. Llewellyn's moon symbol is stamped in gold on the inside of the bag. The bag measures approximately 9 1/2 inches x 5 3/4 inches, and is advertised to fit both large and small Tarot or oracle decks. However, I found that my Inner Child Cards barely fit, as did The Archetype Cards by Caroline Myss. But average sized cards like The Quest Tarot, The Oracle Tarot, Triple Goddess Tarot and Sacred Geometry Oracle Deck all fit wonderfully.<br />If you're looking for a beautiful bag for your Tarot decks, oracle cards, stones, or runes, I highly recommend this one from Llewellyn!	2004-03-06

This book is a good starting point. You may wish to use it as groundwork for expansion to other avenues of spiritual pursuit. I would further suggest that you borrow pieces to construct you personal spiritual path from where you find something that resonates with your being. Take a block from Christianity, a stone from Buddhism, and a brick from Taoism, and cement them together with love to form your personal spiritual path. Every book you read will add a pebble to your path. The choice is yours to make.&quot; --From the Introduction<br />There often comes a time in a person's life where deeper meaning and meaningfulness is desired. Sometimes this yearning is a result of a trauma or difficulty such as illness, divorce, tragedy, or death of a loved one. For others, a richer, fuller, and more peaceful life is welcomed because a life of boredom, confusion, directionlessnes, and apathy is no longer an acceptable way to live. Whatever your reasons for wanting to enhance your spiritual journey, Owens' brand new book Discover Your Spiritual Life - Illuminate Your Soul's Path provides clear, concise, and practical ways to do so. Positive and practical, this book offers the guidance you need to live a more spiritual, meaningful, and peaceful life by becoming a balanced observer rather than a concerned worrier.<br />Throughout this book, the author encourages the reader to take responsibility for their life, make the changes necessary for betterment, monitor thoughts and patterns of experience, and create sacredness through meditation and other spiritual tools. What I like about this book is that Owens &quot;majors on the majors&quot;, so to speak. (As opposed to majoring on the minors.) In the New Testament, Jesus addressed the Pharisees saying, &quot;You swallow camels and strain gnats.&quot; The Pharisees were spiritual leaders who oppressed their followers with rules and regulations, and often nitpicked over what to wear, what constituted work on the Sabbath, etc. In other words, straining gnats. In this book, however, the author deals eloquently and passionately with the &quot;camels&quot; of life--the &quot;big&quot; stuff like forgiveness, positive intent, harmlessness, gratitude, sowing and reaping, and neutrality.<br />As a person who's been on a conscious spiritual path for years, I had wondered if this book would tell me something I didn't know--something that would help me on my own path. While the ideas and suggestions weren't new to me, reading Owens' words were a refreshing distillation of what really matters when one is on a spiritual path or seeks to become more spiritually mindful. Her enthusiasm for the magical--for the sacred--is infectious. Another element I liked about this book is how it reminded me of just how magical a spiritual path is, or can be. The author shares some amazing anecdotes and case histories, some from her experience as a medium.<br />In addition to sharing practical wisdom, she lists a series of exercises at the end of every chapter as well as a to-do list. Of course, none of those are &quot;have-to's&quot;, but her exercises are specifically crafted to help the reader incoporate the ideas of each chapter into their own lives. She's a big fan of journaling as a part of spiritual practice, as well as for healing the self from toxic emotions.<br />For example, in the chapter Understanding Disappointment, Owens asks several questions in the Exercise portion such as:<br />Reflect on disappointment during your adult years that were devastating to you at the time they happened. List them now in your journal, and write the final positive outcomes in your journal. Can you see, in retrospect, how everything had a way of working out for the best? If you had but known then how things would have turned out, would you have reacted so severely?<br />How can you take the lessons from yesterday and use them in the present? Write your thoughts in your journal.<br />Are there things that you do to set yourself up for disappointment? In your journal, list any behaviors that come to mind.<br />What steps can you take to change this behavior? Write ideas in your journal.<br />Owens also addresses the importance of meditation and provides examples of how to create a personal space for meditation and contemplation--including how to prepare an altar and energetically clear your personal space. She even provides a color chart for the use of candles and altar cloths, as well as for focusing intent when meditating. For example, the color green is associated with prosperity, balance, and renewal in all areas where growth is needed.<br />In the chapter Affirmations For Your New Life, the author instructs the reader how to formulate and use affirmations. She also details the fascinating concept of making a presonal treasure map. A treasure map is made of sturdy poster board or cardboard, and decorated with hand-selected items that represent your wish list. You can go to a craft store and choose items that symbolize your intent, as well as cut out pictures and words from magazines to glue onto the paper. You can also write words or phrases with markers, crayons, paint, or whatever you'd like. For example, if you wanted to be a published author, you could choose items that have to do with books and writing such as: the words Amazon.com, pictures of books, a clipping of the N.Y. Bestsellers list, inspiring passages, quotes or words, etc. Add to your personal treasure map as you're inspired, and keep it in a prominent place. That way, it serves as a visual reminder of what you seek to accomplish in your life. You could make a treasure map for relationships, spirituality, vocation, healing, and so on.<br />Whether you are seeking wholeness, healing, mindfulness, spiritual depth, or the everyday sacred, this book would be a wonderful companion on your personal journey.he present?

Besides brevity, it's an added bonus to be able to pick a card or two every day and ponder what it says. This information can be used for increased awareness or as a way incoporate the truths found on the card.<br /><br />The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People card deck is filled with sage advice and practical wisdom, especially for those who want to maximize their potential and live a more balanced life.<br /><br />Covey devotes 7 cards to each of the 7 habits. If you do the math, that equals 49 cards, but there is also a card with a message from Covey. A brief concept is printed on front, and several sentences that expound on the concept is found on back. Each of the 7 habits has it's own color scheme and design, although the overall appearance is uniform. At the top of each card is the particular habit with its number.<br /><br />Here is a sampling of the fronts of my favorite cards from the deck:<br /><br />Habit 1: Be Proactive - Be a model, not a critic.<br />Habit 2: Begin With The End In Mind - Expand your perspectives.<br />Habit 3: Put First Things First - Learn to say no.<br />Habit 4: Think Win-Win - Adopt an abundance mentality.<br />Habit 5: Seek First To Understand, Then To Be Understood - Influence others by example.<br />Habit 6: Synergize - Value differences.<br />Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw - Expand your mind.<br /><br />For example, the back of the \\"Learn To Say No\\" card says:<br /><br />Decide what your highest priorities are, and have the courage and independent willpower to say no--pleasantly, smilingly, and unapologetically--to the things that are less important to you.<br /><br />I highly recommend this inspirational deck for personal growth of any kind. As it says on the back of the box:\\" ...living with integrity and honesty gives you the power to overcome the deeply imbedded habitual tendencies that can work against you. Remember: you are not your habits--and you can replace old patterns with new ones!\\"<br /><br />(To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])ld patterns with new ones!\\"    (To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])	2004-02-17

(Yes, You Read Right)	When reviewing this book, I was curious to see if it differed much from the Member Guide that can be purchased at any Curves For Women gym. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it did: thorough and simplified explanations of metabolism and biochemical aspects of dieting, information on different herbs and vitamins that enhance health in a variety of areas, a Curves workout for home, a stretching chart, success stories, and more.<br /><br />Chapter 1 gives a brief history of the Curves For Women franchise, why Curves For Women differs from other weight-loss plans (it's the only plan where you don't have to diet forever to maintain weight-loss), the missing link in weight-loss (metabolism), and an overview of the rest of the book. At the end of every chapter is a Curves success story.<br /><br />Chapter 2 addresses \\"metabolic magic\\", and how to escape the diet trap of a slow metabolism. This chapter explains how hormones work against us, how to control starvation hormones, why dieters plateau, how dieting chews up muscle, how to make muscle and why it's so important for metabolism, and one of the secret ingredients of the Curves eating plan: you eat more to increase metabolism and retain weight-loss! Chapter Two also addressed how to do a \\"Metabolic Tune-Up\\", what to do if you fall off the diet, and a descripion of the three Phases of a Curves eating plan.<br /><br />Chapter 3 explains the symptoms of carbohydrate sensitivity, and has two tests to determine if you need to be counting calories or carbs. It is explained why carbohydrates can be so bad for you, and how there is a new epidemic of insulin resistance that is causing an alarming increase in Type II diabetes. In order to be liberated from fat-storage mode, it's important to eat an adequate amount of protein, so there's a great deal of information about protein, how it aids muscle, and why drinking lots of water is important for preventing ketosis.<br /><br />Chapter 4 contains a list of \\"free foods\\" that you can eat in any amount, and a 7 page chart that shows you the carbohydrate grams and calories of many common foods.<br /><br />Chapter 5 outlines the carbohydrate-sensitive eating plan, and includes a 25 page meal plan for every day of the week, for 5 weeks. The meal plan also provides a calculation for carbs and calories for each and every portion.<br /><br />Chapter 6 outlines the calorie-sensitive eating plan, and also includes a 25 meal plan lasting 5 weeks, including carb and calorie counts.<br /><br />Chapter 7 discusses general nutrition for healthy body, including protein, fats, butter vs. margarine, essential fatty acids, fiber, carbohydrates, water, salt, artificial sweeteners, alcohol, and phytochemicals.<br /><br />Chapter 8 shows you how to buy good cuts of meat and tell the difference between fresh fish and not-so-fresh fish, and gives cooking tips and general information on foods such as legumes, vegetables, seeds and nuts, dairy and eggs, and condiments. There is also a section on how to read a food label, tips for eating out, and eating on the job.<br /><br />Chapter 9 features the Curves-At-Home workout that lasts 30 minutes. The purpose of the home workout is to strengthen every major muscle group, give your heart and lungs a good aerobic workout, and increase the flexibility of your joints. So even those who are not a member of a Curves For Women gym can benefit from the Curves workout by doing exercises at home. All you have to do is buy an exercise tube (stretch cord) that is four feet long. There are pictures showing each exercise of the at-home workout along with detailed instructions. Also included is the exact same target heart rate chart and Curves Flexibility Exercises (after work-out stretching) that is found in the Curves For Women fitness centers.<br /><br />Chapter 10 deals with enhancing your workout at Curves, for those women who are already members. It also features pictures of each of the machines used in the gym and how they are used. For example, you'll see 2 pictures of a woman using the squat machine--one standing, and the other squatting. The same is illustrated for every machine/exercise, as well as detailed informaiton on how to use the machines correctly and maximize benefit--including tips for Curves pros.<br /><br />Chapter 11 discusses total health supplements for enhancing the Curves program, such as daily supplements, minerals, antioxidats, phytonutrients, amino acids, and more.<br /><br />Chapter 12 addresses special health concerns such as arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, osteoporosis, preganancy and menopause. There are numerous medical studies that are cited, as well as advice and information on how to maximize your health when dealing with these conditions. This chapter even discusses herbs such as black cohosh, licorice, don quai, and red raspberry and how they can help menopause. This section is 31 pages long so there is a lot of helpful information on understanding these conditions which will empower you to make informed choices about your health.<br /><br />The last part of the book is the Curves Daily Planner which includes shopping lists for both the carbohydrate-sensitive and calorie-sensitive eating plans, recipes, multivitamin/mineral supplement shopping list, daily meal planner, Phase 3 re-training your metabolism chart, and a weekly progress report.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants or needs a change in lifestyle in order to become more fit and healthy.

There are more than 4,000 food comparisons in this book that are in two user-friendly formats: alphabetical, and hi-low comparison charts. What's also great is that this book provides carb counts for eating out--including chain restaurants like Taco Bell, McDonald's, and Subway. Even carb counts for medications like cough drops and syrup are included!<br />The introduction includes a Body Mass Index (BMI) Chart, Range of \\"Desirable\\" Weights Chart, and an explanation of carbohydrates.<br />Sections include:<br />Beverages<br />Breads, Crackers, and Flours<br />Cereals<br />Combined and Frozen Foods<br />Dairy<br />Dining Out (Asian, Deli, Italian, Mexican, etc.)<br />Fast Food<br />Fruits<br />Gravies, Sauces, and Dips<br />Meats<br />Meats, Processed<br />Medications<br />Miscellaneous Foods<br />Nuts, Beans, and Seeds<br />Oils and Fats<br />Pasta, Whole Grains, Rice and Noodles<br />Poultry<br />Salad Bar Choices and Dressings<br />Seafood<br />Snack Foods and Chips<br />Soup<br />Sweets<br />Vegetables<br />Vegetarian Choices<br />The alphabetical charts compare items by letter. For example, under Sweets: Donuts you would find listings starting with Apple Fritter and ending with Sugared. In the Hi-Low Comparison Chart, however, the chart begins with the lowest carb count (Crueller, plain) and ends with the higest carb count (Jelly Stick).<br />This carb counter has it all, and I highly recommend it to those who are on low-carb diets such as Atkins, South Beach, and Curves For Women--as well as those who just want to lower their intake of carbs.	2004-02-17

Archetypes, which are impersonal energy patterns, help us and others fulfill these contracts. (For more information on Archetypes and how they \\"dance\\" together, see my article Seeing Yourself and Life Symbolically.)<br /><br />You may wonder \\"Is Finding Your Sacred Contract Workshop just a re-hash of what's in the Sacred Contracts book?\\" (At least, that's what I wondered!) The answer is no. There is definitely an expansion of some of the elements covered in the book, as well as interesting stories about Archetypes and how they play out in actors, politicians, and even Myss herself. You may also be wondering \\"Do I need to read Sacred Contracts to understand the Workshop?\\" In my opinion, yes you need to read the book to understand the major tenets covered in the Workshop.<br /><br />Why? Although Myss conveys practical wisdom that could be understood by anyone, she refers often to the \\"3 columns\\" that are in the book, as well as the Archetypal Wheel, Archetype/chakra correlation, and the Archetype gallery in the back of the book. I think those references would prove confusing for those that have not seen those elements visually (3 columns and the wheel), as well as those not familiar with Archetypes and how they play out contractually.<br /><br />Even though I read and highlighted my copy of Sacred Contracts many times, I found myself taking 13 pages of notes (front and back, lined paper) from this audio Workshop. I'll share some gems from each of the CD's in a minute, but I need to warn you: there are some people that find Myss abrasive, arrogant, and rude. In fact, when I first started listening to this CD set, I was so turned off by the arrogance she displayed in the first few minutes that I turned it off in disgust...waiting several months to even put it back in the CD player.<br /><br />The story? She mentioned encountering someone in California who claimed to channel an archangel (and would do it for a price) as well as providing other services like massage. Nothing in Myss' story indicated that the woman was defensive or haughty, but Myss shares that she thought Don't you even go there, you snoot. I'll slice you in half like a muffin. In fact, in the beginning of CD 1 she says that her whole purpose is to disorient the audience: \\"I need to unplug you from who you are right now because you are my obstacle. To move and shut off your 'personal self'.\\" She certainly isn't everyone's cup of tea, especially in person or on audio. But there's no denying that Myss has some great wisdom to impart, especially in the realm of becoming more empowered and conscious. And, I can certainly see why some people need a swift kick in the behind to jolt them out of patterns of disempowerment and victim-consciousness.<br /><br />CD 1<br /><br />Myss describes the Archetypal wheel, the House divisions, the purpose of contracts and their \\"animation\\", and the illusion of personality. She discusses how we are under \\"spells\\" in our unconsciousness and how \\"spell perception\\" has more authority than our own reasoning capabilities. This is why counselors are \\"spell breakers\\" of illusion and self-deception. She goes on to share how we can become strong enough to be break those spells ourselves.<br /><br />CD 2<br /><br />Myss continues to talk about archetypes and contracts, the connection between emotional states and illness, the 3 angels you meet before incarnating (necessity, choice, compassion), energetic currency, chakras and spiritual alchemy. She discusses archetypes in the public, such as Hilary Clinton exuding Goddess Athena, Kevin Costner as Hero, and Sean Connery as King.<br /><br />CD 3<br /><br />Myss uses examples of great spiritual masters and teachers (like Jesus) and explains the role of four archetypes common to all people (Prostitute, Child, Victim, and Saboteur.). She also discusses these four archetypes in greater depth, as well as how we lose power and the fundamentals of spiritual alchemy when healing wounds of the past. Myss tells a funny story about how 2 seemingly contrary archetypes may show up in a person, such as a female Stanford Professor in a mini-skirt who portrayed both the Scholar with the Goddess.<br /><br />CD 4<br /><br />Myss fields questions about archetypes (including \\"Can your archetypes change with time?\\") She also discusses how the four archetypes common to everyone show up in health challenges (for example, Saboteur hits the stomach/spleen area), how to use the archetypal chart, shadows, and navigating contracts. Myss also takes a closer look at the differences between Healer and Servant, Knight and Warrior, Wounded Healer, Prophet (like Gorbachev), and other archetypes.<br /><br />If you've studied Jungian psychology and archetypes, you may have a problem with the theory that you have 12 fundamental archetypes in your first wheel that never change (as well as two other outer wheels.) Like any profound and powerful tool, Myss' archetypal wheel system can be a double edged sword. On one hand, a person can use the process to further delude themselves, especially if they focus on only a few archetypes at the exclusion of possible others that are working prominently in their psyche and life. For example, thinking \\"Well, Vampire is not an issue for me because it's not even in my first wheel.\\" Or, using archetypal concepts to relate to people as mere archetypes as opposed to, well, people.<br /><br />However, I've not found a greater tool for excavating the personality and consciousness-and using it to become more aware and empowered-than the Myss archetypal model and the concept of sacred contracts. This CD series is well worth the affordable price, as well as the Sacred Contract book. It's an investment in your life, your health, your awareness, and your happiness.

Well, this isn't just another dream book--and let me prove it to you. Just look up any symbol, and you'll find that the meanings behind that symbol are revealed in a manner you can actually apply to the situations that are affecting your life--and the choices that are available to you right now!\\"<br />The above is from the back of the book Street of Dreams, and yes, that's exactly what I was thinking...not another dream book. I'm not a big fan of dream books as it is. Too many one-size-fits all meanings for my taste, especially since I believe we all have our own \\"soul code\\" that encompasses our fears, hopes, dreams, personality, past situations, etc. I thought I'd give this book the benefit of the doubt, however (especially since the cover was so pretty...).<br />I had a dream the other night, so I thought I'd look up the main elements in this \\"definitive dream decoder\\". Unfortunately, the main elements of my dream were nowhere to be found in the book, including party, carnival, tarot cards, bedroom or construction. So, I had another dream last night, and thought I'd give it yet another chance. Bus, family, and telephone were certainly in there, but amusement park, Ferris wheel, and spinning were not. There were a lot of other dynamics not addressed in the book, either.<br />I'm obviously going to have to apply my own system to my dreams, because there are overlaps between the two dreams, including telephoning someone in my Mother's bedroom, and having people somehow coming into the room and bothering me while I'm trying to call. Also, the carnival/amusement park element is another common theme for me to explore, as well.<br />I've looked up and read some of the other elements in my dream, and the author does ask some good questions concerning many of the symbols that he includes. The book is 424 pages, so it certainly has some bulk to it. He also has a great \\"Dreamer's Checklist\\" in front that includes questions like:<br />Is my dream helping me solve a problem that's happening right now?<br />Am I revisiting the past in my dreams?<br />Is my dream a way for me to develop my memory?<br />Does my dream relate to a film or TV program that I've just watched, or a book I've just read?<br />Is my dream so wacko that I'm not supposed to decipher it--it will work itself out in time?<br />Nacson asks other relevant questions in the Checklist section that are really quite good. The back of the book boasts that he addresses modern symbols like the DVD player, but I could not find it in the book. The symbols are alphabetized, and I looked under DVD, film, video, etc. There is no index, so I couldn't look it up that way.<br />Everywhere I look lately, I see people posting about the dreams they've had and wanting help to interpret them. From where I stand, understanding your own dreams, and consciousness itself, cannot be found in a pill or a book. It takes grunt work to uncover what your dreams are saying to you. In fact, having another person interpret your dream is a good way to avoid what your subconscious or Guidance may be telling you. Why? Well, a part of us wants to stay asleep. And human nature usually seeks to avoid pain--including the truth. (Which is often painful.) If someone offers us a interpretation that sounds good or helps us avoid the true issue at hand, we may latch upon it and build upon it--while the message of our psyche goes unnoticed and uninterpreted.<br />If you want a dream decoder, this is the best one I've come across.

What would happen if the Earth were to receive a transmission from outer space? What if someone--or something--had a message for humankind? How would it affect humanity to know we are not alone?<br /><br />What if there was indeed a message being communicated to humanity, but it was imbedded in a form much closer to home? In fact, what if there was a message within the DNA of every man, woman and child on the Earth?<br /><br />A result of 12 years of research, The God Code is a fascinating new book by Gregg Braden that boldly proclaims that not only is there a message encoded in our DNA, but also that this chemical message is the ancient name of God.<br /><br />Using a portion of the ancient Kabbalah known as the Sepher Yetzirah, Braden explains that each of the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet has a corresponding numerical value. The Sepher Yetzirah is considered a meditative text that contains mysterious alchemical language.<br /><br />Citing numbers as the universal language that aids in comparing \\"apples to apples\\", Braden correlates these numeric values with the ancient name for God, the elements of fire, water, air, and earth, and the atomic mass of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and carbon--the very elements that make up our DNA.<br /><br />The result?<br /><br />\\"The key to translating the code of DNA into meaningful language is to apply the discovery that converts elements to letters. Based upon their matching values, hydrogen becomes the Hebrew letter Yod (Y), nitrogen becomes the letter Hey (H), oxygen becomes the letter Vav (V), and carbon becomes Gimel (G). These substitutions now reveal that the ancient form of God's name, YH, exists as the literal chemistry of our genetic code. Through this bridge between God's name and the elements of modern science, it now becomes possible to reveal the full mystery and find even greater meaning in the ancient code that lives as each cell of our bodies.\\"<br /><br />Our DNA may then be read literally as a translatable alphabet within each of our cells. What are the odds of these four Hebrew letters randomly creating a meaningful message? Only 1 in 234,256.<br /><br /> Einstein once said: \\"My comprehension of God comes from the deeply felt conviction of a superior intelligence that reveals itself in the knowable world.\\" Other brilliant minds have also echoed the concept of \\"intelligent design\\". With the discovery of the \\"God code\\", we now know that God has left a calling card within our very DNA. When decoded, this message reads \\"God/Eternal, within the body\\". This certainly introduces a new spin on the ancient spiritual truths of \\"look within\\" and \\"know thyself\\"!<br /><br />So what does it all mean? We are here by design-by an intentional act of creation. And, we are all connected by this amazing message shared within our DNA. 95% of the Earth's population believes in God, and the \\"God code\\" proves our common ancestry and connection to one another. In fact, the name of God not only correlates numerically in Hebrew, but also in Arabic! Braden says \\"...the code carries the same message of possibility and hope to the three religions that account for over one-half of the world's population: Judaism, Islam, and Christianity.\\"<br /><br />This brings me to the entire point of Braden's book: 80 million children, women, and men were lost to violence based in ethnic, religious and philosophical conflicts just in the last century. This is more than the lives lost through natural disasters and AIDS combined during the same time period. We are faced with the mid-century projected collapse of the Earth's ecosystem, the largest build up of weapons and military forces since WWII, and drug resistant diseases. Nearly 1/3 of the world's nations are engaged in armed conflict. Humanity is the greatest threat to our future.<br /><br />Einstein also said that a problem cannot be solved with the same thinking that created it. Braden hopes that his 12 years of research pays off with mankind realizing thatwe can transcend the differences that threaten to obliterate us by having a shared vision. Instead of waiting for a unifying disaster like September 11th, the God code could serve as a starting point for unity.<br /><br />Citing examples of humanity's courage, goodness, and kindness, Braden believes that this is truly our \\"natural state\\". He also explains that periods of chaos is what leads to the establishment of new patterns. Change is a form of chaos, and for humanity to heal the beliefs that has led us to think our differences are intolerable, three things must be present: (From the book)<br /><br />1. We must be willing to change<br />2. We must believe that the change is worth making.<br />3. We must believe that change is possible.<br /><br />Braden is very hopeful, believing that history shows our willingness to change is our basic nature, and the escalating threats to our survival provide a worthwhile reason to change. That leaves the notion of believing that change is possible:<br /><br />\\"Although the literal text of the message 'God/Eternal within the body' will undoubtedly be subject to various interpretations, the fact that the message exists at all speaks volumes. Regardless of 'who' or 'what' we believe is the source of our genetic code, the tremendous degree of order implied by the message says that something else is 'out there'. This reminds us that we're part of a bigger picture, and perhaps a bigger plan. For these reasons, the message in our bodies is unprecedented in its role of providing a platform of common ground in the resolution of our differences.\\"<br /><br />For humanity's sake, I truly hope Braden is right.d vision.

Sex is a subject that is not often talked about among couples. Unfortunately, it is also an area that accounts for a large chunk of divorces. Women expect men to be mind-readers, intuitively knowing just what to do to bring them pleasure. Men assume that they should know what to do already, as if males are born as sex experts. (Not!) What often results is great expectations met with disppointment, and thwarted, hit-and-miss attempts at intimacy and sexual fulfillment.<br />With this book by Dr. John Gray, sex doesn't have to be a frustrating and hurtful guessing game. Gray explores areas such as sexual versus emotional fulfillment, taking responsibility for your own pleasure, how to increase desire and rekindle passion, a women's need to relax, the joy of quickies, passionate monogamy, and home-cooked sex versus gourmet sex. Both men and women are given maps into the murky terrain of the other's attitudes and expectations about sex, which will no doubt result in a sigh of relief by many. At last, someone understands! While providing accurate maps, though, Gray acknowledges that every person (especially women!) are unique, and as such, have unique desires, likes, and dislikes.<br />When discussing giving a man positive direction, Gray points out that some women do not realize a man's sensivitity in this area. Men want to please their women, so certain comments can feel like rejection to a man, which will bring an instant chill to intimacy. Here are 10 sexual turnoffs outlined by Gray:<br />1. \\"You're not doing it right.\\"<br />2. \\"I don't like that.\\"<br />3. \\"Ouch! That hurts!\\"<br />4. \\"Don't touch me like that.\\"<br />5. \\"That tickles.\\"<br />6. \\"Not like that.\\"<br />7. \\"Not yet.\\"<br />8. \\"Not there.\\"<br />9. \\"I'm not ready.\\"<br />10. \\"What are you doing?\\"<br />Gray then goes on to explain why a man shuts down, how to give positive feedback and re-direction, and 20 sexual turn on phrases.<br />The Chapter titled How To Drive a Women Wild With Pleasure provides men with some excellent practical advice on how a woman ticks, and how to rev up her engine. Gray advises:<br />\\"A man needs to remember that to increase a woman's pleasure, he needs to delay direct stimulation. Certain ancient temples are dedicated to the female aspect of God. According to one ritual associated with these temples, you have to circumambulate the temple three times before entering it. This same principle to loving and adoring a woman during sex.\\"<br />One of the most practical parts of this book is that it contains drawings. Yes, drawings. How do you expect to know where to put what? Seriously, though, it's important to know about anatomy to understand what may bring a man or woman pleasure.<br />Gray understands the pressures that many couples face, and explains why many are having less sex. He also explains why men are like the sun, and women are like the moon. (A very helpful analogy!)<br />The \\"voice\\" of this book is very understanding and encouraging, coaxing men and women to re-discover the joy and pleasure of intimacy and sex. Rather than going without, or relegating yourself to frustration and disappointment with regards to sex, why not pick up this book (or something like it) and make the decision to enjoy your sexuality? It is my belief that we are given these bodies to enjoy, and the delight of sexual intimacy with our mate is a part of that. (I mean, if God didn't intend women to enjoy sex, then why give her a clitoris!)<br />Ignorance is *not* bliss when it comes to mutual sexual fulfillment.

Let me start off by saying this book provides far more than just Tarot spreads. Admittedly, the promise of 100 spreads was the reason I bought this book in the first place. As I began my journey reading Tarot, I needed spreads to practice my skills--only knowing the common Past/Present/Future spread. There were spreads online, but I wanted a resource in book form.<br /><br />Suprisingly, out of 288 pages, only 84 pages contain spreads--and they're in the back. The authors show you how to do a Yes/No spread, and which cards represent yes, which cards represent no and those that represent maybe. The rest of the spreads are categorized by the number of cards, spanning from the single \\"Card a Day\\" spread to the 24 card Double Horoscope Spread.<br /><br />Spreads include Birthday Spread, Child Spread, Prosperity Spread, Horoscope Spread (covering all 12 Houses of the Astrological Chart), Chakra Spread (a card for each chakra plus a meditation card), Relationship Spread, Wish Spread, Career Spread, and New Relationship Spread.<br /><br />My two favorites are the Mirror Spread and the Treasure Chest Spread.<br /><br />The authors have this to say about the Mirror Spread: \\"Quite often, the qualities we dislike in another person are qualities in ourselves we aren't crazy about, either. In this way, the Mirror Spread addresses our shadow selves as well as our projections. The fifth position, what is really there, is actually a summation of a relationship's weakness or strengths.\\"<br /><br />Mirror Spread<br /><br />Card 1: The image: how you see the other person<br />Card 2: The reflection: how the other person sees him/herself<br />Card 3: What the other person represents to you<br />Card 4: What you represent to the other person<br />Card 5: What is really there<br /><br />I love the Treasure Chest Spread because of its imagery and because it's so affirming to the individual.<br /><br />Treasure Chest Spread<br /><br />Card 1: Diamonds Where you shine. Major talents, abilities and assets that you have<br />Card 2: Pearls What you know. Knowledge and information that you have incorporated into your life<br />Card 3: Gold coins What you have. Money and material possessions currently available to you<br />Card 4: Emeralds Who you know. Relationships that are now part of your life<br />Card 5: Platinum Chains What's holding you back. Things or people in your life that you need to release<br />Card 6: Sapphires Where you could shine. Emerging talents, assets, and abilities.<br />Card 7: Quartz Crystals What you're learning. Knowledge and information that you could incorporate into your life.<br />Card 8: Rubies Who you may soon know. Relationships that are entering your life.<br />Card 9: Unpolished Diamonds Your hidden lights. Assets and talents that you can develop.<br /><br />As I mentioned, however, this book is much more than just spreads. I found it incredibly helpful in learning the meanings and nuances of Tarot cards because the authors take each of the 78 cards of Tarot, and show you what each means for different scenarios. The authors devote a paragraph to each issue, explaining what the card means in a general reading and for questions related to work, romance, finances, health, spirituality, and empowerment. So, if the querent is asking a question about finances, for example, and the Hermit is drawn, you would find the section on the Hermit card, and read the paragraph under Finances to get an idea of what this means.<br /><br />Power Tarot also features brief, general information on the Major and Minor Arcana, the Court Cards, personal loss cards, and the four elements. I highly recommend this book for those who are curious about Tarot, wanting to know how it works and what the cards mean, as well as beginning readers trying to put it all together. The variation of the 100+ spreads will appeal to both the beginner, and the seasoned veteran Tarot reader.<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of [[ASIN:1571745874 The Back in Time TarotBook: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present]] (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)	2004-01-15

Colors and Numbers is no exception.<br />Each page features either colorful and whimsical artwork or painted textures that seem to leap off the page. For example, one page looks like purple, crinkled paper, and another like gray, woven tweed. These are also accented through the pages with words, as well as other collages and pictures of whimsy. It's a nice bit of eye candy, for sure. (What can I say...I'm a sucker for sensual, colorful books!) The illustrator, Tammy Smith, has done a wonderful job in capturing the essence of this book.<br />However, make no mistake: this book isn't all style and no substance! The introduction features Colors and Numbers at a Glance, and the first chapter goes into the role color and numbers have played in historical and mystical traditions. Hay then instructs you on how to calculate your Personal Year, Month and Day and explains how knowing these numbers can help you attune to vibrational elements specific to yourself. She also covers Double and Triple intensity days and what these mean for you vibrationally, as well as other helpful hints on how to integrate color and be mindful of your Personal Numbers.<br />A full page is devoted to each of the Personal Years, and Hay provides encouragment and insight for each, as well as how it serves as the &quot;background music&quot; to your life. In addition to this information, there is a short affirmation at the bottom summing up the Year. For example, a #5 Year has the affirmation I welcome change and expand my boundaries!.<br />A full page is also devoted to each of the Personal Days. Like the Personal Years, Hay illustrates the focus of each specific Personal Day. What should you be looking for? What areas might need attended to? Is relaxation in order--or time to get some things in order? She answers these questions for each and every Personal Day. Like the Personal Years, there is an affirmation, but these are much longer (a paragraph).<br />A very helpful addition to this book is the personal calendar section. Each month of the year has it's own page in calendar form, so you can calculate your Personal numbers and write them in the blank squares. That way, you know your Personal Month and Day at a glance. Then, you just turn to the corresponding section in the book to see how you can best align yourself to the numeric vibrations that are unique to you--creating a smoother flow for the day by working with a particular vibration.<br />There is also a list of each of the seven colors of the rainbow, and the foods that correspond to the colors. For example, the Violet section lists blackberries, eggplant, dark grapes, purple plums, passion fruit, and dulse.<br />I highly recommend this book if you're looking for a new and unique way to be more mindful of your life and how you can better get into a personal flow that works with the current vibrational frequencies. If you're experiencing personal roadblocks in life, mapping our your Personal Numbers could pave a smoother path of ease as you navigate your life and its lessons.o get some things in order?

Much of the insights presented in this unusual conversation were a wonderfully fresh way of seeing All is One and that All is Love. A year or so later, I was browsing the children's section of the bookstore and came upon The Little Soul and the Sun: A Children's Parable Adapted From Conversations With God. I read it right there and it brought tears to my eyes.<br />Here it is some years later, and I've just bought this delightful book for my son as a Christmas present. This beautiful story is illustrated in lavish pastels by Frank Riccio, and features a parable about Little Soul--one who wants to experience itself as Who I Am. You see, Little Soul knows that it is Light--but feels that knowing isn't enough. So Little Soul asks God if it can actually feel what is means to be the Light. So God asks Little Soul how it can experience the Light when it is already as a candle in the Sun, along with the other billions of souls who make up the brilliance of the Sun? Little Soul entreats God to think of something--some way in which it can experience what it feels like to be Light.<br />God answers Little Soul \\"Since you cannot see yourself as the Light when you are in the Light, we'll surround you with darkness.\\" Little Soul asks \\"What's darkness?\\" and God replies \\"It is that which you are not.\\" Little Soul asks God if it will be afraid, but God says \\"only if you choose to be...there is nothing, really, to be afraid of, unless you decide that there is.\\"<br />One of the central themes of Conversations With God is that in order for God to experience Itself, It had to be contrasted with something else--something \\"other\\". You cannot experience dark without light, up without down, now without then, fast without slow. The purpose of duality is to experience parts of the God-self in all Its glory. In a sense, we are all a part of God, and God exploded into a million Souls to experience Itself.<br />However, when We made the journey Earthward, We forgot where We came from--and Who we were. Little Soul and God continue the conversation, and talk about how everyone is special in their own way--each manifesting a different part of \\"special\\". Some parts of special include kindness, creativity, and patience. Little Soul decides that the part of \\"special\\" it wants to experience is the part of special known as forgiveness. A multitude of Souls gather around God and Little Soul to hear this extraordinary conversation, and God sweeps an arm towards them: \\"There is nothing to forgive\\" God says. Little Soul could hardly believe what God said. \\"Everything I have made is perfect. There is not a single soul in all of creation less perfect than you. Look around you.\\"<br />Little Soul grumbles that this wasn't fun at all! How would it experience itself as One Who Forgives if there was noone to forgive? Just then, Friendly Soul offers to help him, volunteering to come into Little Soul's next lifetime so it can do something for Little Soul to forgive. Little Soul was incredulous, and aks why Friendly Soul, who was such a magnificent Being of perfect Light, would want to become dense and dark--slowing it's vibration in order to do this bad thing for Little Soul to forgive? \\"Simple\\", The Friendly Soul replies. \\"I would do it because I love you.\\" Friendly Soul goes on to explain that both it and Little Soul have been male and femaile, good and bad, victim and villian--All of It. \\"Thus have we come together, you and I, many times before; each bringing to the other the exact and perfect opportunity to Express and to Experience Who We Really Are.\\"<br />In being the \\"bad one\\" this time around, Friendly Soul will give Little Soul the opportunity to experience itself as One Who Forgives. Friendly Soul becomes serious and confirms that it will have to become dense and dark to do this act--and that both it and Little Soul may forget Who They Were. Friendly Soul asks Little Soul a favor: to remember, in the moment that it strikes and smites Little Soul--doing the worst that it can possibly imagine--that Little Soul will remember Who Friendly Soul Really Is.<br />An agreement was made, and Little Soul goes forth into a new lifetime, excited to be the Light--and to experience that part of \\"special\\" called Forgivness. \\"...whenever a new soul brought joy or sadness--and especially if it brought sadness--the Little Soul thought of what God had said. 'Always remember', God had smiled, 'I have sent you nothing but angels.'\\"<br />My favorite passage of the book, which is the major theme of the New Age, is \\"And so\\", God concluded, \\"when you are surrounded with darkness, do not shake your fist and raise your voice and curse the darkness. Rather, be a Light unto the darkness, and don't be mad about it. Then you will know Who You Really Are, and all others will know, too. Let your Light so shine that everyone will know how special you are!\\"avor: to remember, in the moment that it strikes and smites Little Soul--doing the worst that it can possibly imagine--that Little Soul will remember Who Friendly Soul Really Is.<br />An agreement was made, and Little Soul goes forth into a new lifetime, excited to be the Light--and to experience that part of \\"special\\" called Forgivness. \\"...whenever a new soul brought joy or sadness--and especially if it brought sadness--the Little Soul thought of what God had said.

Aggravating. 5 Stars for content, zero for editing.<br />Shoddy editorship aside, the information in this book is helpful and even fascinating. Author, marketer, corporate anarchist, and founder of Marco Polo Explorers, Marco Marsan was named one of America's top Out-of-the-Box thinkers by the Mazda Corporation. Think Naked came out earlier this year, and it's a delightful book about re-discovering child-like brilliance. Marsan has something interesting things to say on the inside flap of his book: &quot;Dr. Seuss once described adults as 'obsolete children'. Extensive studies show that there is a 98 percent chance you were a creative genius before age four. Business week magazine says that a 40-year old adult is about two percent as creative as a five-year-old child. Findings like these tell us that creative genius isn't something you find--it's something that you've merely, and perhaps, only temporarily lost.&quot; Some chapters in this book include You Were A Genius:Discovering the childlike brilliance you were born with, See Saw:Balancing the combination of kidlike genius with your adult wealth of experience, Wear Your Cape:How to create conditions that encourage risk-taking without fear, and Show And Tell:How to get in touch with your passions and your exuberance.<br />Throughout the book, Marsan gives fascinating examples from scientific studies, pop-culture, trends, nature, and other sources to illustrate just how in the box many of us remain--especially when it comes to personal satisfaction and creativity.<br />This book is a lot of fun to read, and stimulates thinking outside of conventional, plodding thought patterns. Refreshing and bold, it's sure to be a welcome addition for the library of a manager or business professional, and for anyone wanting to infuse the zest of new perspectives into their lives.wanting to infuse the zest of new perspectives into their lives.	2003-11-22

I've always been drawn to computer-generated images, and my two favorite archetype decks are both computer generated. I was dabbling in traditional Tarot, and although I liked the concept of the deck I was using, the readings felt forced and uninspiring. Maybe Tarot wasn't for me? Maybe I should just stick with archetype decks?<br /><br />Then I received The Quest Tarot. I was excited to finally get to see the entire deck and feel them in my hands, but my heart sank as I thought I wouldn't be able to use them. I guess I convinced myself I would never be able to understand or use traditional Tarot. I did a reading, not expecting them to \\"speak\\" to me. Boy, was I ever wrong--and wonderfully surprised! I have received eerily accurate readings every single time I've used this deck.<br /><br />I had a misgiving about this deck, I admit. The author and artist, Joseph Martin, has imbued the cards with additional divinatory elements such as astrological signs, runes, Hebrew letters from the Kabbalah, Roman letters, I Ching, gemstones, yes/no features, and the ability to discern hair and eye color. Absolutely daunting, I thought. I already felt like a Tarot failure--why would I want to add to it by mixing in things like the I Ching and Kabbalah?! When I saw the deck for myself, however, I realized these elements did not distract me in the least. If anything, they added a special dimension to the reading. If you know nothing about these other divinatory elements, don't worry--I'm pretty clueless about Kaballah, runes, and I Ching myself. The thorough explanations of these elements are clearly laid out in the book that accompanies this deck, so you can just look up their meaning and see how it adds to the reading. However, you don't need to use any of the additional divinatory elements if you don't want to. These symbols add to the beauty of the cards, but don't distract from the images and messages.<br /><br />The Book<br /><br />The book that comes with the deck, The Compass Guide to the Quest Tarot, is a hefty 296 pages. The first 107 pages are detailed instructions, with graphics, on how to interpret the astrological symbols, runes, gemstones, I Ching, and other divinatory features. There are 28 pages dedicated to Tarot games and spreads, including a special Quest Tarot spread. Included is a Celtic Cross record sheet that you can photocopy and enlarge to keep track of readings.<br /><br />For both the Majors and Minors, there are two pages dedicated to each card. The page on the left includes an image and the divinatory elements, and the page on the right includes card explanation, upright meaning, and reversed meaning. The author also addresses each of the four suits, and how they play out energetically in everyday life.<br /><br />The Cards<br /><br />This deck is a traditional tarot deck, but includes a special addition to the Major Arcana--The Multiverse card. Also included is one blank card that you can personalize however you see fit. My husband is an artist, so I can't wait for him to draw up personal totems and symbols that I hold dear. The cards dimensions are approximately 4 ¾ x 2 ¾ inches, and feel very sensual and smooth when handling and shuffling.<br /><br />The Minor Arcana contain astrological features found on the upper left of the card, where one circle contains a planet and the second circle contains the sign it is in. The Aces of each of the four suits do not have planetary connections; instead, they have time references. On the upper left is a circle containing a clock with 3 numbers highlighted. On the upper right, is a circle containing seasonal symbols: fallen leaves for Autumn, a setting sun for Summer, falling snow for Winter, and flowers for Spring. The I Ching symbols on the upper right hand corner are only found on the other Minor Arcana cards. All the suits follow traditional Tarot, except the Pentacles (Disks) suit has been re-named Stones.<br /><br />This deck has an Ouija-like yes/no feature that is in the form of a pair of swords found only on the Court cards. Also exclusive to the Court cards are hair and eye color indicators. Since the people featured on them are made of shiny metal or glass--deliberately vague as to be universal--this indicator helps to determine physical attributes. Another unique aspect of the Court cards: Martin feels that since we no longer lived in a social structure filled with Kings, Queens, Knights and Pages, that the Court cards should reflect a more familial structure. Giving a nod to entering feminine energy at this point in history, Mother leads the way, followed by Father, Daughter, and Son.<br /><br />The Major Arcana features runic symbols on the upper left hand side, as well as Hebrew letters. One astrological symbol (sign or planet) is on each of the Majors. On all cards, at the bottom, are small Roman letters and gemstones throughout the border in varying degrees. (The Multiverse card features Chiron and no Roman letter--being a \\"wild card\\".) In addition to the card name on the front, there is also a keyword below it. I've found this a great feature that makes the card meaning readily recognizable--even if I'm just reading intuitively as opposed to taking the description in the book at face value.<br /><br />Number 14, traditionally known as Temperance, is re-named Alchemy in this deck. Likewise, card number 20, Judgment, has been re-named Aeon.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I highly recommend this deck and book to the Tarot veteran, as well as the individual who has never used a Tarot deck. The ethereal, high-tech images speak of ancient mysteries and archetypal wisdom, and the extra divinatory elements add sacred and specific knowledge for insight, clarity and personal transformation.<br /><br />(To see 12 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)at is in the form of a pair of swords found only on the Court cards.

US	49524801	R13Q9IVOSCAPM4	0805070184	896010947	Women Who Think Too Much: How to Break Free of Overthinking and Reclaim Your Life	Books	5	167	172	N	N	Excellent Book On Breaking Free From Overthinking	Women Who Think Too Much came out earlier this year, and I gobbled it up in two sittings. Several people have borrowed this book from me, and have found it incredibly insightful. (And not all have been women, either!) This book features a breakthrough new method that teaches you how to free yourself from the negative cycles of overthinking.<br /><br />What is overthinking? Nolen-Hoeksma, a professor of Psychology, contends that our society is both fast-paced and overly-self-analytical. The self-help section in bookstores bulge with upteen ways to analyze yourself and gaze at your bellybutton. With this self-analysis comes over-thinking--and Nolen-Hoeksema has discovered that women are more prone to overthink than men. Women spend countless hours fruitlessly thinking about negative ideas, feelings, experiences, and relationships. The result of this over-thinking? A huge number of women are feeling sad, anxious, or seriously depressed.<br /><br />The author provides case studies, but they aren't presented in a dry, intellectual tone. She connects the dots between the research and how it impacts women in their day-to-day lives. Chapter titles include What's Wrong With OverThinking?, Married to My Worries: Overthinking Intimate Relationships, Always On The Job: Overthinking Work and Careers, and ten other chapters. The great thing about this book is that it doesn't just talk about why overthinking is bad for mental, emotional, and even physical health, but also provides several chapters on how to break free from overthinking and move to higher ground.<br /><br />In the Chapter If It Hurts So Much, Why Do We Do It?, the author explains fascinating discoveries in brain science, and how when we think of one bad thing, it usually cascades into a torrent of negative thoughts and emotions. She writes:<br /><br />\\"The organization of our brain sets us up for overthinking. Each little thought and memory we hold in our mind does not sit there isolated and independent from other thoughts. Instead, our thoughts are woven together in intricate networks of associations...This intricate organization of the brain into in interconnected networks of memories, thoughts, and feelings greatly increases our efficiency of thinking. It's what helps us see similarities and connections between issues...But our spiderweb of a brain also makes it easy to overthink. In particular, the fact that negative mood connects negative thoughts and memories, even when these thoughts and memories have nothing else to do with one another, sets us up for overthinking. When you are in a bad mood for any reason, your mood activates--literally lights up--those nodes of your brain that hold negative memories from the past and negative ways of thinkings. This makes them highly accessible: it's easier to get there with your conscious thoughts. This is why it is easier to think of negative things when you are in a bad mood than when you are in a good mood. It is also easier to see interconnections between the bad things in your life when you are in a bad mood...\\"<br /><br />The author describes three phases of conquering overthinking, and covers each phase in separate chapters: breaking free of its grip, moving to higher ground and gaining a new perspective, and avoiding future traps by building your resources. Not only does she provide example scenarios of how to implement these strategies, but she also has a quick reference section in chart form at the end of each of these chapters. For example:<br /><br />Strategy: Don't go there.<br />Description: Choose not to get involved in situations that arouse overthinking.<br />Example: Jan knew that spending too much time with her mother was sure to result in weeks of overthinking, so she kept her visits short.<br /><br />Another example:<br /><br />Strategy: Let go of unhealthy goals<br />Description: Let go of goals that are impossible or that cause you to act self-destructively.<br />Example: Briana decided that rather than try to lose 50 pounds by starving herself, she would lose 20 with a diet prescribed by her doctor.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in neuro-science and the thought/emotion connection, as well as those looking for pratical strategies to manage negative self-talk and unproductive mental chatter.by her doctor.

Five artists illustrated this deck, so there is a lot of creative diversity to the lush images and scripts on each card. There are 12 cards dedicated to each of the four agreements. On each, the main agreement is printed at the top of the card, and a whimsical, flowing phrase is weaved throughout the image. On the back of each card are insights about that particular phrase and agreement. Some insights are only one sentence, and others are several sentences.<br /><br />The cards come in a square box that features the same image that is on front of the book. What is great about the container is that it's a matte finished, flip top box constructed of sturdy cardboard. Thus, it's easy to take the deck in and out of the box when wanting to look at the cards, or just drawing one to meditate upon for awhile.<br /><br />Some examples from the deck:<br /><br />One card about Always do your best features a woman with an enormous beehive hair-style. She is adorned with gold jewelry, and different shades of blue and green swirl about her. There is a golden hue that seems to emanate from behind her hair, while 2 birds have made a nest therein. The phrase? Don't Overdo. The back of this card says Always do your best, but don't overdo! When you overdo, you deplete your body and go against yourself, and it will take you longer to accomplish your goal.<br /><br />A card about Don't take anything personally features a man with his eyes closed, orange and yellow hues and clouds surrounding him. Several small objects seem to swirl around his head, including a hand, a planet that looks like Saturn, several tiny stars, an eye, an open book, a ribbon, etc. The phrase on the front says Everyone lives in their own dream. On the back, the card says all people live in their own dream, in their own mind. They are in a completely different world from the one we live in.<br /><br />Another card, dealing with Don't make assumptions, features a woman with a lampshade on her head that has flowers dangling from it. Peach and pink tones surround her as she waears a black dress with pink flowers. On the back of this card, it says The biggest assumption that humans make is that everyone sees life the way we do. We assume that others think the way we think, feel the way we feel, judge the way we judge, and abuse the way we abuse. We are afraid to be ourselves around others because we think others will judge us, victimize us, abuse us, and blame us as we do ourselves.<br /><br />An dark-skinned man wearing a hat strums a guitar while four birds surround him. The phrase Create a beautiful dream graces the front, and speaks of Be impeccable with your word. The back of the card says Your word can create the most beautiful dream, or your word can destroy everything around you. Impeccability of the word only creates beauty, love, and heaven on earth.<br /><br />What stands out about this deck is the rich colors. Both sides contain colorful images that differ from the front of the card--and the rest of the cards. Vibrant and alive are two words that come to mind when I see and feel this deck. It is not necessary to have read The Four Agreements book to enjoy this deck, but the cards are a beautiful and gentle reminder of the truths laid out in the book. The Four Agreements Cards would make a wonderful addition to mindfulness and meditation practice, as well as a cheerful and profound reminder that we can choose heaven over hell at any time.<br /><br />(To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])es a woman with a lampshade on her head that has flowers dangling from it.

It is not necessary to have read The Four Agreements book to enjoy this deck, but the cards are a beautiful and gentle reminder of the truths laid out in the book. The Four Agreements Cards would make a wonderful addition to mindfulness and meditation practice, as well as a cheerful and profound reminder that we can choose heaven over hell at any time.

He shares personal Daymaking stories about his sister who passed away when she was 13, his wife, daughters, and his path to becoming a hairstylist and eventual CEO. He also shares the stories of others, inspirational quotes, and practical tips on how you can be a Daymaker.<br /><br />Wagner shows how a little kindness goes a long way, and what can happen when you focus on your wild ideas and follow your dreams. He then explains that to make another's day, you must first make your own day--and outlines ways to simplify your life, de-stress, and nurture yourself. The subsequent chapters detail how to make the day of your mate, your child, your whole family, a friend, a stranger, and an entire company!<br /><br />For example, when making a stranger's day, it's important to remember that you don't know the whole story. Wagner writes: \\"We don't know what challenges face the people we meet each day. Is the bald woman in the movie theater a skinhead, or is she battling cancer? Is the beautiful woman with the storybook marriage dealing with her husband's adultery, while battling bulimia, as Princess Diana turned out to be? Is the woman on the airplane with the crying infant going home to her own mother's funeral? Is the man in the speeding red car weaving in and out of traffic on his way to the hospital with his toddler who swallowed cleaning fluid? These are just a few reminders that situations are not always as they appear.\\"<br /><br />There are many simple, yet practical ways to be a Daymaker. Write a poem about your child when he or she is born. Leave love notes for your spouse, or make them a creation from your heart. Be a Daymaker to a teenager by complimenting them on anything positive that you can. Take a co-worker out to lunch on their birthday, learn their children's names, and bring them a small treat of coffee or tea. Foster an environment of service and Daymaking in your office and corporation; it's infectious, and will spill over to your employees and your clients.<br /><br />This is my favorite story in the book: \\"In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less than they do now, a 10-year-old boy entered a coffee shop and sat down at a table. When the waitress put a glass of water in front of him he asked, 'How much is an ice cream sundae?'<br /><br />'Fifty cents', replied the waitress. The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it. 'Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?' he inquired. By now, other people were waiting for tables and the waitress was growing impatient. 'Thirty-five cents', she brusquely replied. The little boy again counted his coins. 'I'll have the plain ice cream', he said. The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy finished the ice dream, paid the cashier and left.<br /><br />When the waitress came back to wipe down the table, she began to cry. There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were two nickles and five pennies. You see, he couldn't afford the sundae, because he needed to have enough left over to give her a tip.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to those seeking to make an impact on their immediate environment and the world--as well as those looking for a great inspirational gift that would make the day of another.tion; it's infectious, and will spill over to your employees and your clients.

To Chinese Astrology	Animals in the Stars is a richly illustrated book about Chinese astrology for ages 8 and up. The first part of the book discusses the origin of the Twelve Earthly Branches, which today we call the Chinese Zodiac. The ancient people of Zhonngguo, also known as the Middle Kingdom (China), observed the cycles of the seasons, the pairing of the animals, the sun and moon--and learned to live in harmony with nature and it's opposites of yin and yang energy. This way of living was so important that many gave it a name: Taoism.<br /><br />The wise priests could tell when rains would come and predict how plentiful the harvest would be. The people of the Middle Kingdom didn't have a way to mark time, but the priests realized that as they looked back upon their lives, certain years had specific hallmarks: some years were years of action and success like a monkey, and other years were times of careful thought and planning like a snake. After talking together and closely observing the animals around them, the wise people could tell that the years seemed to be influenced by one of 12 different animals. So they concluded that time was governed by 12 animals which correlated with specific influences--and each animal ruled one year. They also noticed that all the people they observed seemed to be ruled by a certain animal, as well.<br /><br />The book then goes into the delightful story of the Jade Emperor, and how it was decided that the Rat would be first in the cycle, followed by Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Boar.<br /><br />Next is a Chinese Zodiac chart that has every year from 1924 to 2043 and it's corresponding animal, which makes it easy to locate your animal year. Two pages are devoted for every animal in the Zodiac. The first page features a short explanation of the characteristics of the animal, and then has a short section on the qualities of a person born in that year, what kind of trouble a person may have, and who makes the best friends. For example, a person born in the year of the rat is hard working, intelligent, and a charmer--among other qualities. Rats can have trouble if she lets her suspicious nature take control and works too much, and her best companions are Ox, Dragon, and Monkey. The second page tells a corresponding story from Chinese folklore that features the animal. For example, the story about the Rat is called Rat's Big Day At The Market.<br /><br />Color illustrations grace each page of the book. The author, Gregory Crawford, is also the illustrator of the book. The pictures in Animals in the Stars were done in mixed media: pen and ink, watercolor, gouache, acrylics, and colored pencils. It is 31 pages long, and while it's a children's book, I think even adults would enjoy it! It was interesting to learn about Chinese culture, read a traditional story about each of the animals, find out how the Rat ended up being chosen as the first animal of the Chinese Zodiac, and to understand the personality qualities for the 12 animals.<br /><br />I tested the story on my son who's 5, but he wouldn't sit still long enough for me to get through the first section; also, it would make for a very long bedtime story! Perhaps a parent could read about one animal a night for those with longer attention spans. It's written in a very understandable way, but older children may have trouble with the Chinese proper names. However, there is a good amount of text which should help older children flex their reading muscles.<br /><br />This is a great book for both children and adults who would like to learn about Chinese astrology and culture.mple, a person born in the year of the rat is hard working, intelligent, and a charmer--among other qualities.

US	49524801	R29VMRRCKDIMP3	0764177087	342164256	The Wisdom Well: Dip Into Your Subconcious to Foretell the Future [Cards]	Books	5	31	32	N	N	Gorgeous and Insightful	The Wisdom Well by Ivarna Kalinkova is an unusual and luxurious book and deck set that marries tarot with Jungian psychology--although the cards are not a traditional tarot deck. Rather, there are 36 cards (half of a complete tarot deck) that feature lushly illustrated Archetypes that are imbedded within human consciousness. Jung never produced a definitive list of Archetypes, and indeed, it would be impossible: Archetypes merge into one another, and the collective unconscious is creating new Archetypes all the time.<br /><br />Archetypes are templates for universal behavior patterns and psychological dramas. Destruction and resurrection are an archetypal pattern, as is Persona (the masks we wear in different situations), Teacher (the higher aspect of ourselves and self-education), and Beggar (self-denial and inner hobo/Cinderella).<br /><br />So why bother to work with archetypes at all? In Jungian psychology, when archetypes invade our consciousness, they have negative and destructive effects on our lives, as in addiction. There is a common phrase in the New Age that says \\"if you spot it, you got it\\". In other words, that which we project outward, in the form of admiration or repulsion, are really parts of our self that remains hidden--in shadow--and in need of integration. The external world is but a reflection of our subconscious--our inner world. To integrate our shadows is to become whole, which then contributes to the wholeness of the collective.<br /><br />When you work with a book and deck such as Wisdom Well, you begin to recognize how the unknown parts of yourself have been affecting your decisions and life circumstances. As you start to integrate archetypes internally, astounding metamorphosis occurs--accompanied by clarity, wisdom, and inisights into the future.<br /><br />Wisdom Well is a smooth, glossy hardback book with a beautiful green leather-like motif. It is the most unusually constructed book that I've ever come across: when you open it, a paperback book is anchored on the right (with the same cover as the exterior). On the left, the deck of cards are contained within a sturdy, purple paper case, imbedded into a frame of the same material and color. The number 12 card, Aspiration is adhered to the front of the card case. In the recess, there is a purple ribbon underneath to allow for easy deck extraction.<br /><br />The book itself is 96 pages and contains several sections. The first four pages give an introducton to Jung and archetypes. The next section shows you how to do a reading with the use of simple one and three card spreads, and then shows you how to intepret the cards. Instructions are also given on how to discern time frames with the cards, and how the other cards in the spread, as well as the question asked, can modify card meanings. There are two pages devoted to thumbnail images of each card, includng the card name and page it can be found. Each of the 36 cards have two pages: on one page is the card itself in the forefront of a gorgeous, colorful background. The other page is a brief meaning of the card, key words, a quote from Jung about the archetype or similar theme, and the meaning of the card reversed.<br /><br />The layout is accessible, the pages are thick, the images are glossy and vibrantly colorful, and the information is concise but profound.<br /><br />What I like most about this deck is that it doesn't get so specific about archetypes that you feel overwhelmed or like you're trying to plug in life situations to fit a narrow definition. Rather, you are given a general image, and the key words can cover quite a few areas that are governed by this archetype. For example, keywords for The Wise Old Man card are: Roots and ancestry. Inheritance. Experience. Intuition. Traditional knowledge. The psychic. Connection with other realms, times and beings. People ahead of their time. The old and the new. Dipping into the well of the psychic.<br /><br />I get the feeling that the author trusts the reader enough to mine their own subconscious without having to dictate rigid or simplistic meanings for archetypes. In fact, the author stresses that the cards give an outline, but your own associations will fill in the rest. What a specific card means to me will mean something different to you--although the archetypal pattern itself will be similar. The author also wisely recommends against turning to the cards when you are in emotional turmoil; rather, wait until you get a modicum of detachment, or have someone else read for you.<br /><br />Everyone of these cards are exquisite, and include archetypal themes and nuances that are illuminating. Every time I look at the pages in this book or at one of the cards, I feel as though I'm looking into a mirror. Waking from a dream, I now take the steps to uncover the meaning of the symbols and themes within the dream. Indeed, when life is lived unconsciously, what are we living but a dream? In order to integrate and become more conscious, it requires us to wake up from our unconscious slumber.<br /><br />Additional archetypes represented in this book and deck include The Psyche, Anima/Animus, The Mandala, The Demon Queen, The Night Watchman, The Woodcutter, The Alchemist, Father Earth, Trickster, Mother Moon Goddess, The Virgin/Whore, The Wounded Healer, The Patriot, The Ogre, The Child Within, The Prisoner, and so on. I really like the Mirror Woman card. The quote from Jung associated with this card is \\"The more projections are thrust in between the subject and the environment, the harder it is for the ego to see through the illusions.\\"<br /><br />This has now become my favorite archetype deck, and I've already received immediately helpful information and comfort from these cards. They would make a wonderful addition to any tarot or oracle collection, as well as a thoughtful gift for someone who enjoys Jungian psychology, archetypes, and enhancing consciousness.<br /><br />(To see 10 images from this deck, visit the Reviews section at [...])ing to dictate rigid or simplistic meanings for archetypes.

It implied that my life sucked--and it didn't! However, I was too curious not to look. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />We all have areas in our life that \\"suck\\". They are the uninvestigated thoughts and assumptions we have made that are a part of our reality. These, in turn, affect our decisions and perspectives. As a result, we often sell out, self-sabotage, and put up with things that suck our energy. It's these \\"little foxes that spoil the vine\\", to borrow from the Bible, that often eat at our enjoyment of life and its blessings.<br /><br />I'm glad that the publishers of this book, The Jodere Group, were brave enough to allow for the title. \\"Suck\\" is an oft-used word in American culture, but it has the stigma of being crude slang. Yet, Cohen maintains that there are many aspects of life (including \\"energy vampires\\") that can literally suck the vitality right out of us--leaving us feeling drained, tired, anxious, depressed, angry, cheated and empty.<br /><br />It took me awhile to get through this book because there are so many wise nuggets to absorb. I had my highlighter out, and soon realized this is a book that is not to be consumed quickly. Don't get me wrong: it's not difficult reading. Cohen writes in a friendly, conversational style--as if he's sitting in the living room with you. He uses personal stories, examples of well-known people, and quotes from others. (And he's also hilarious!) But what makes it a book to read slowly is that it contains such practical wisdom and advice for every area of life: relationships, money, vocation/work, spirituality, creativity, personal empowerment, sex, and so on.<br /><br />Why Your Life Sucks is divided into 10 Chapters or reasons why your life may suck. Each Chapter/Reason then has sub-sections that cover the areas of how your life sucks and what you can do about it.<br /><br />For example, Reason 1 that your life sucks is that You give your power away. The how of giving your power away is:<br /><br />You put people on a pedestal.<br />You imitate instead of create.<br />You don't listen to your intuition.<br />You let others choose for you.<br />You think your destiny depends on something outside of you.<br /><br />He then shares ways to plug up the proverbial leaks in your bucket, so you're not sucked dry. Here are a few gems I highlighted just in Chapter 1:<br /><br />Physical death is mandatory, but spiritual death is optional.<br /><br />If you don't use your mind, someone else will.<br /><br />Drop what you've been taught so you can remember what you know.<br /><br />Your true strength resides in holding your power in the midst of those who have abdicated theirs.<br /><br />In the long run, you are the one who will have to live with your decisions, so make sure they represent your true desires.<br /><br />Here are the other 9 reasons that your life may suck:<br /><br />Reason 2: You expect it to suck<br />Reason 3: You get fooled by appearances<br />Reason 4: You waste your energy on things that suck<br />Reason 5: You keep trying to prove yourself<br />Reason 6: You say yes when you mean no<br />Reason 7: You think you have to do it all yourself<br />Reason 8: You try to fix other people<br />Reason 9: You starve your soul<br />Reason 10: You forgot to enjoy the ride<br /><br />Many self-help offer little advice on how to navigate out of the murky waters of discontent; they just tell you what you already know--being big on what, but not how. This book, however, gives practical advice and real-life stories to help you plug up that leaky bucket that's been draining you of your life, your passion, and your energy.<br /><br />I'll leave you with a nugget from Chapter 4: \\"Do what brings you life. Do not do what deadens you.\\"You put people on a pedestal.  You imitate instead of create.  You don't listen to your intuition.  You let others choose for you.  You think your destiny depends on something outside of you.    He then shares ways to plug up the proverbial leaks in your bucket, so you're not sucked dry. Here are a few gems I highlighted just in Chapter 1:    Physical death is mandatory, but spiritual death is optional.    If you don't use your mind, someone else will.    Drop what you've been taught so you can remember what you know.    Your true strength resides in holding your power in the midst of those who have abdicated theirs.    In the long run, you are the one who will have to live with your decisions, so make sure they represent your true desires.    Here are the other 9 reasons that your life may suck:    Reason 2: You expect it to suck  Reason 3: You get fooled by appearances  Reason 4: You waste your energy on things that suck  Reason 5: You keep trying to prove yourself  Reason 6: You say yes when you mean no  Reason 7: You think you have to do it all yourself  Reason 8: You try to fix other people  Reason 9: You starve your soul  Reason 10: You forgot to enjoy the ride     Many self-help offer little advice on how to navigate out of the murky waters of discontent; they just tell you what you already know--being big on what, but not how.

She also could see auras. In her book \\"What Color Is Your Aura?\\", she catalogues humanity into that correlates with their aura color: 14 distinct personality patterns: red, orange, magenta, yellow, physical tan, mental tan, green, nurturing tan, loving tan, blue, violet, lavender, crystal and indigo. Her book also contains an in-depth questionnaire to determine your predominant personality type and aura.<br /><br />Bowers explains each of the 14 colors and how each approaches physical reality, their mental attitudes, emotional makeup, social style, compatibility with the other 13 colors, personal power and leadership style, financial choices, career options, and spirituality. It's an informative manual on 14 distinct personality patterns that can aid in career searches, understanding mate compatibility, relationships, finding life purpose, and so on.<br /><br />In many ways, this book was a precursor to the ANSIR® personality system. (Bowers and Seich were planning on collaborating before Bowers' untimely death.) What Color Is Your Aura? is a fascinating trip into auras, energy, and personality patternsand--aiding you in seeing yourself and others with fresh, and more compassionate, eyes.	2003-10-28

This is a great primer about spiritual healing and healing modalities.<br />Don't let the title of this book put you off. The Complete Idiot's Guide to Spiritual Healing by Dr. Susan Gregg has the simplistic layout of the &quot;Idiot's Guide&quot; book so it's easy to navigate. Dr. Gregg was a student of Don Miguel Ruiz, author of The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide To Personal Freedom, and his Mother, Sister Sarita, before becoming a Toltec Nagual.<br />The very first page sets the tone and intent of the book: a cheerful orange reference card that spans the entire page. On it are suggestions for creating a daily routine, making a list of nurturing things, and a list of affirmations called Talking to Yourself in the Mirror, which Dr. Gregg encourages you to add to with your own positive statements.<br />Illustrated &quot;bubble&quot; boxes are sprinkled throughout the book, and include Snake Oil (pitfalls you may encounter on your spiritual quest), Clarity Corner (definitions and more in-depth explanations of key concepts), Sage Advice (quotes and short vignettes to uplift and keep you on track), and Spiritual Shortcuts which includes exercises, meditations, and other bits of information that will help you move more rapidly on your path.<br />And this isn't even the bulk of the book! There is information on alternative healing modalities, altered states of consciousness, body work, inner guidance, eating mindfully, emotions vs. feelings, exercise, life purpose, surrender (which doesn't mean giving up!), dominion vs. domination, nature as healer, relationships and intimacy (into-me-see, as she cleverly writes), planetary healing, channeling, spiritual traditions of healers (Native American, Mexican, South American, European, African, Voodoo, and Huna) and a whole lot more. The great thing about this book is that it doesn't read like a boring New Age 101 Textbook full of pure theory. Dr. Gregg presents herself as having her feet planted firmly on the ground--yet she brings knowledge from Grandmother (the Divine Feminine) to the table in a blend that is both practical and &quot;beyond the dream&quot;.<br />The subjects covered are broad in scope, but specific enough to get your general questions answered. If it's not, there is an indepth section in the back called &quot;Additional Reading&quot; which lists books in specific sections, and even includes a section on Organizations and relevant contact information.she brings knowledge from Grandmother (the Divine Feminine) to the table in a blend that is both practical and &quot;beyond the dream&quot;. <br />The subjects covered are broad in scope, but specific enough to get your general questions answered.

The Toltecs were an ancient group of scientists and artists that was formed to explore and preserve the practices and spiritual knowledge of the ancient ones. It is not a religion, but a way of life that embraces spirit and honors all the spiritual masters who have taught on the earth. Toltec wisdom arises from the same essential unity of truth as other sacred esoteric traditions that are found all over the world.<br />The Four Agreements are very simple, but very profound. To embrace and live each of the Four Agreements is to find yourself experiencing personal freedom--possibly as never before. The Four Agreements are:<br />Be Impeccable With Your Words<br />Don't Take Anything Personally<br />Don't Make Assumptions<br />Always Do Your Best<br />From the cover of the book:<br />Be Impeccable With Your Word: Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.<br />Don't Take Anything Personally: Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.<br />Don't Make Assumptions: Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.<br />Always Do Your Best: Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.<br />This book may be small in size, but it packs a hefty punch in terms of shattering personal illusions and opening up a path to personal freedom. I consider this book a must-have for anyone wanting to become more conscious and wanting freedom from personal stories and agreements that cause suffering.is book a must-have for anyone wanting to become more conscious and wanting freedom from personal stories and agreements that cause suffering.	2003-10-28

The Japa meditation is simple, calming, and beneficial for mental clarity and peace.<br />I mostly bought this book because it also contains a CD of a guided meditation called &quot;Japa&quot;. I have never formally meditated before with guided imagery, so I thought I would give it a try, especially since I was familiar with Dyer's books and loved his personal style and wisdom. Japa meditation focuses on the sound &quot;Ah&quot;, which Dyer notes is a sound common in all names of God, such as Yahweh, Allah, Ra, Jehovah, Krishna, Kali, Yeshua, and so on.<br />His gentle and soothing voice guides you to visualize 1the first 10 words of the Lord's Prayer (Our Father Who Art In Heaven, Hallowed Be Thy Name), and then focus on the &quot;gap&quot; between words where there is space and silence. Then, you voice the &quot;Ah&quot; sound along with Dyer. I realize that sound is very healing and sacred, but I personally don't like to verbalize the &quot;Ah&quot; sound along with Dyer. However, by hearing Dyer chant &quot;Ah&quot; between the gaps of the Lord's Prayer, it helps me center in on that &quot;gap&quot; and feel the vibration and Presence of God. I tend to be more visual, so imagining the &quot;space between&quot; helps to cease the mind's incessant chatter.<br />I highly recommend this book and accompanying CD for greater mental clarity and overall feelings of peace--especially if you have reservations about guided meditations or have never used one before. Getting in the Gap also contains a section of testimonials from those who have had remarkable experience using the Japa meditation.	2003-10-28

In Jungian analysis, all parts of a dream, fairy tale, or myth are really components of ourselves. We can re-write the ending and claim healing for ourselves by becoming our own Mother.<br />She recounts the English tale of the Stolen Woman Moon, Inuit fable of The Stone Child, Little Red Cap (which is an early version of Little Red Riding Hood), and other stories. She then talks about how, in Jungian analysis, all parts of a dream, fairy tale, or myth, are really components of ourselves. Estes also mentions that the fairy tales and stories we strongly identify with, especially as children, become a type of script for many of us--myths for our own life. If the story doesn't have a happy ending traditionally, we need to change the ending of how we want the &quot;tale&quot; to turn out in our own lives. Of all the stories on the tape, it was the last story that moved me the most, though. She shares that the story of the Lost Dog, which was her favorite growing up.<br />The lost dog goes wandering from house to house, looking for a home. The dog gets chased away, yelled at, and so on. No one wants to dog around, let alone make him a part of the family. The dog is so weary and feels so alone. He then sees a house at the end of the rail road tracks that has a light burning within. He says to himself in despair This is the last house that I will try. He scratches the door, and it opens. The house is filled with children that were having a birthday party, and they squeal in delight at the presence of the dog--thinking that he was a birthday present.<br />Oh, to be received as if you were a present instead of a scourge or a nuisance!<br />Since all elements of a story/myth are within, and parts, of ourselves, it comes back to becoming your own Mother. Your own welcoming party. Your own celebration. Your own guide, comforter, and nurturer.<br />If you have an internal wounded, abandoned, orphaned, or neglected child, realize that you can &quot;grow your own Mother&quot; inside. A partially burned piece of wood always has an ember inside, waiting for a wind to blow on it and coax it to become a flame once again. There is a part of you that can Mother--the child within. When we turn to our inner child, nurturing it and loving it, we heal the child, the inner Mother, and the other parts of ourselves, as well. One of the words for God in the Old Testament is El Shaddai, and in the Hebrew, this is a feminine word that literally means &quot;Many-breasted One&quot;. There is a Mother heart of God, not matter which way you choose to connect with this Source or Divinity--or what you choose to call it.

US	49524801	RZIWLK622H2HF	1561708046	980373838	Zen Cards (Small Card Decks)	Books	5	24	24	N	N	Zen Cards are a beautiful way to add some peace to your day!	Zen Cards by Daniel Levin is a beautifully simple and calming deck. There are 50 individual cards in 5 colors: purple, brick red, olive green, teal, and lime green. The first thing that struck me about this deck, however, was the delightful box in which the cards sit: the top of the box flips up, so the cards are easily accessible. The box is of Asian design with a sturdy construction.<br /><br />Zen has become a popular topic in the modern world, largely for its simplicity and profound wisdsom. These 50 cards have a lovely Oriental-like font, and each card has a topic written on one side, and a saying on the other. For example, one card is called Zen Mind which says \\"Experience all things with the enthusiasm of a child, as if you were seeing it for the first time. This is the Zen mind. Always new, always aware, always that of a beginner.\\" Another is Harmony which says \\"Restore harmony. Create peace in all situations. Rather than pushing the river, flow with it.\\" Yet another card is called Harmlessness which says \\"All beings fear violence. All beings fear pain. When you see yourself in all your brothers and sisters, then how can you bring harm to them?\\" Other topics include Balance, Sincerity, Joy, and Stillness.<br /><br />I have the box of Zen Cards sitting on my desk. Every night before I go to bed, I shuffle the deck and pick a card. I find the words very calming and centering--almost as if the simple and profound message on each card serves as a light breeze that blows away any tension, confusion, or anxiety.<br /><br />You could use this deck as an oracle when seeking guidance or for meditation and encouragment. Perhaps when picking a card a day, you could tape it to your bathroom mirror or computer monitor--reminding you everytime you look at it of the profound simplicity and peace that is Zen.<br /><br />This deck would be a wonderful gift for people of all faiths, as well as a great way to treat yourself to some daily inspiration, stillness, and clarity.<br /><br />(To see several card images from this deck, visit the reviews section of [...])m this deck, visit the reviews section of [...])	2003-10-21
US	49524801	RP9960SPTQM3T	0385504209	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	4	1	2	N	N	An Amazing Page Turner	I admit, I was clueless about the hype surrounding this book. I just knew that it was on the bestseller list. So, I saw it on the library shelf, and thought I'd give it a whirl.<br />My favorite books are thrillers and mysteries, but sadly, the stuff that's being churned out these days is pretty much garbage. I didn't start this one with much hope, either.<br />Boy was I surprised! I am a former Christian minister (now a \\"New Ager\\") who's just now starting to explore the Divine Feminine. (You know how taboo *that* is, right? And believe me, it ain't just Catholicism...) I knew that El Shaddai meant many-breasted one, but that was about it.<br />The information in this book blew me away. It all made perfect sense to me. (Although I can certainly see how it would enrage Christians!) It's very rare that you find a book that is both an engaging work of fiction *and* a deliverer of historical and mystical ideas. It has whet my appetite to explore the Divine Feminine and this aspect to spirituality that I've been missing out on due to my upbringing.<br />For some reason, I felt the first 3/4 was the best part of the book, but it was very satisfying on all levels--even the ending. However, Brown gets into too much detail with architecture, the looooong cat and mouse part at Westminister Abbey, etc. A good deal could have been trimmed from this book.<br />The characters are memorable and unique: an Albino monk, an Englishmen in Paris who walks on metal crutches, a hot-head French capitan,... I felt as if I could see each and every one.<br />Setting wise, all the French streets and architectual references were lost on me, but the details didn't take away from the pace of the novel, nor the intrigue.<br />Technically, Brown did everything he was supposed to: ended the chapters with hooks, shifted perspectives fluidly, \\"showed not told\\", etc. It's formulaic...but formula *works*.<br />You'll enjoy this book if you love good fiction and if you have an open mind.	2003-10-18
US	49524801	R1RWU4ZG7DJJQ0	1844090000	188360092	The Silent Stones Colour Oracle	Books	4	16	16	N	N	Do you want to know who you were in a past life?	The Oracle comes in two parts: the cards, and the Silent Stones Colour Scroll. The actual cards are 3 3/8 inches X 2 3/16 inches, and there are 33 of them. (The box is 4 inches x 6 inches.) The \\"Scroll\\" is actually a piece of paper with the image of a scroll and 33 numbered, colored ovals. There is also a 43 page guidebook that accompanies the cards and scroll.<br />The premise of this oracle is to discover your past life/lives, and how they may be affecting you now and in the future. The authors state: \\"People have often incarnated many times in their soul's desire to learn, to resolve an issue or to bring forward knowledge to help humanity.\\"<br /><br />The 33 cards each have an image of either 3 or 4 colored ovals that are stacked vertically. On the back of these cards, at the top, is one of 33 past lives. These include Incas, Hebrews, Native Americans, Atlanteans, Vikings, Knights Templars, Star Children, Early Christians, Japanese, etc. Also on the back is an explanation of the 3 or 4 colored ovals on the other side. This is the first stage of the oracle.<br /><br />To do a meditative reading, they instruct to ask your angels or guides to show you a color that represents your past life, and then pick the card matching the color/colors that you visualized/were given. To do an intuitive reading, they suggest that you intuitively choose a card that stands out to you. Then, out of the 3 or 4 colors on the card, you are to choose one color that stands out among the ovals. When you turn the card over, it will tell you which past life you are working with and which aspect of that life is affecting you now. You can match up the past life to the description in the Guidebook.<br /><br />The next step involves the Silent Stones Colour Scroll. You are instructed to intuitively choose a color which stands out to you. (These ovals are also numbered 1-33). This color represents the qualities that you have brought forward from that past life into this one, and there are 4 pages that describe these personal qualities. For example, picking Red for your first color would mean An energetic, vital person, vibrant, outgoing, dynamic, with leadership qualities.<br /><br />Then, you are to intuitively choose a second color from the Scroll. This color represents certain influences that will be affecting you in the next few weeks of your life. There are then 5 pages that describe these influences. If you were to pick Red as your second color, it states You will lead a new project forward, which should go smoothly if your intention is clear.<br /><br />Here is an example of the \\"reading\\" I did for myself.<br /><br />I spread the 33 cards out and picked the card that I felt drawn to. This card had a White oval on top, a Rich Royal Blue oval second, a Lilac oval third, and a Silver oval on the bottom. I then picked the color that I felt the most drawn to, and it was the rich royal blue oval.<br /><br />When I turned the card over, it said that I belonged to the Cathars (Albigentians), and the Rich Royal Blue represented Teachers, and those dedicated to spiritual expression. Apparently, while the groups of colors determine the particular past life you had, the colors themselves represent the energies (and strands from that life) being brought into incarnation now by those who were Cathars in past life.<br /><br />The ironic thing is this: I had never heard of the Cathars before I used this oracle. But right after, within a few days, I ran into this very term. I definitely have a Teacher/Guide Archetype at work in my psyche, and have been dedicated to \\"spiritual expression\\" since I was a young girl. (This being represented by the Rich Royal Blue oval.)<br /><br />When I went on to the next step, choosing a color from the Scroll, I picked White, which means a person pure of spirit. When I picked my second color, I chose Indigo. This future orientation means After a period of introspection, your wisdom may be expressed through writing or the media in order to help people see a different perspective. This, too, was eerily accurate for several reasons.<br /><br />Now, understand that I'm not into past lives like some people, and I don't look to past lives as a reason (excuse?) for what is happening to me today. Yes, it's possible that I was indeed a Cathar, and a teacher/spiritual leader to boot, and that would explain my talents and interests. Yet, it doesn't give me any practical information in navigating my life. Confirming what I already know? Possibly.<br /><br />My concern with these cards, and any oracles for that matter, is that people place their current lives on hold while they examine possible past lives for months (years?) on end. This is, of course, not the fault of the authors of this oracle. In fact, they expressly state in the beginning of their guidebook: \\"The future is never set in stone. These readings are possibilities and probabilities based on the past and the present. Your thoughts create your future, so you have the power to change a prediction or to enhance and strengthen it.\\"<br /><br />Kudos for this wonderful disclaimer!<br /><br />At best, I can see how this oracle could help some discover their unconscious patterns and bring them to light, and also encourage/confirm hidden or obvious talents and aptitudes. At worst, it can be a fun parlor game for individuals and groups.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend Silent Stones Colour Oracle for those interested in exploring past lives and how they may be impacting your present situation. Please note that I don't think that the packaging for the contents of the oracle will hold up very well over time.curate for several reasons.

US	49524801	R1CB8K4ZLEWHPU	1401901840	696853801	Archetype Cards	Books	5	73	81	N	N	Beautiful Deck	The cards are 5 1/2 inches long and 3 1/2 inches wide. I have very small hands and have no trouble shuffling this deck. There are 74 Archetype cards, and 6 blank cards. The edges of the cards are rounded, and boasts over 63 border colors.<br /><br />Yes, you read right--63 border colors. Each card front has 3 elements: a center image enclosed in an octagon, a pale yellow partial circle enclosing the center image, and a colored border on the top and bottom of the card. As I began to work with these cards, I realized that there were many shades to the borders. I counted 8 different shades of brown, 17 shades of green, 14 shades of blue/purple, 4 shades of pink/mauve, 8 shades of orange/yellow, 9 shades of red, 3 black borders, and 2 unusual border colors like steel gray (Mediator) and plum gray (Engineer). Each border color has an imbedded etched design that's a shade lighter than the border color and is the same etched design that's on the box.<br /><br />Talk about rich! When trying to find the words to describe some of the borders, I thought I'd have to dip into my son's crayons! Here are just a few of the border colors: earthy taupe, creamy tangerine, midnight blue, olive green, deep mauve, teal, sienna, honey, moss, chocolate, lavender, sky blue, forest green, amber, indigo, sand, seafoam green--it's enough to make your mouth water! (By the way, I just made up most of those color names based on what they looked like to me.) There are 6 blank cards that are bordered with the same bright red as the box, although the border is more narrow. The octagon in the center is blank for you to make up your own Archetype cards, and, as with the rest of the deck, contain the scripts \\"Light Attributes\\" and \\"Shadow Attributes\\".<br /><br />Accompanying this deck is a 105 page Guidebook that is the same size as the cards. You need not to have read Caroline's book Sacred Contracts to use this deck, because the Guidebook gives you the mini-version of her take on the 4 survival Archetypes common to all (Child, Saboteur, Prostitute, and Victim), Archetypes in general, and even questions for self-examination in determining Archetypes that play a major part in your life.<br /><br />Some card examples: The Poet is a profile of an African-American woman with glasses. As she speaks, a pair of doves seem to fly from her mouth. The Guide is a women dressed in royal blue, and she blends in with the blue background. An owl is perched on one hand, and a latern is held in the other. This card reminds me of The Hermit in traditional Tarot. The Rebel is what looks to be a teenage girl, sitting upon a sofa that's perched on a tree trunk. The Detective is a woman with a book to her face, peeping out of a hole in the cover. The Addict is a man pushing against a tidal wave, the Bully is a blustering, blowing storm cloud, and the Destroyer is an erupting volcano. The Rescuer features a woman in a boat, about to throw a heart-shaped life preserver overboard. The Dilettante features a 5-armed woman, which is a very accurate way to look at the \\"jack of all trades, master of none\\" aspect of this Archetype. The Prostitute is reminiscent of Demi Moore's character in Indecent Proposal, especially as a nude woman covered with money.<br /><br />A deck this universal could be used for divination, daily meditation, writing (character development), etc.<br /><br />This is an outstanding deck in terms of size, construct, artwork, color, and Archetypal accuracy. If you're interested in the subtle nuances of Archetypes and how they play out in your life, or if you're interested in better understanding yourself and others, I would recommend this deck.<br /><br />(To see 6 card images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section of [...])<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)ld, Saboteur, Prostitute, and Victim), Archetypes in general, and even questions for self-examination in determining Archetypes that play a major part in your life.

When we don't examine and question our thought patterns or behaviors, we can move along life quite mindlessly--and quite miserably--at the mercy of the beliefs and commitments we've made during childhood or crisis.<br />A few of the author's questions are reminiscent of those addressed by other self-help books, but there's a beautiful simplicity in the directness of her 10 questions that is immediately applicable and immediately helpful. You don't have to wade through technical terms or concepts to &quot;get it&quot;. And I admit, I like this approach. It's refreshing to have someone lay out a common-sense process to enriching life and increasing personal freedom, rather than craft a convoluted theory or system that promises perfection or enlightenment and bogs down an already-overwhelmed reader in the process!<br />The Right Questions<br />1. Will this choice propel me toward an inspiring future or will it keep me stuck in the past?<br />2. Will this choice bring me long term fulfillment or will it bring me short term gratification?<br />3. Am I standing in my own power or am I trying to please another?<br />4. Am I looking for what's right, or am I looking for what's wrong?<br />5. Will this choice add to my life force, or will it rob me of my energy?<br />6. Will I use this situation as a catalyst to grow and evolve or will I use it to beat myself up?<br />7. Does this choice empower me or dis-empower me?<br />8. Is this an act of self-love or self-sabotage?<br />9. Is this an act of faith or an act of fear?<br />10 Am I choosing from my Divinity or am I choosing from my humanity?<br />If you're having a rough time navigating through your life and feel drained, directionless, frustrated, and paralyzed, I highly recommend Debbie Ford's new book The Right Questions. When you start to ask the right questions, you can finally arrive at empowering and live-giving answers.R>10 Am I choosing from my Divinity or am I choosing from my humanity?<br />If you're having a rough time navigating through your life and feel drained, directionless, frustrated, and paralyzed, I highly recommend Debbie Ford's new book The Right Questions.

How's your relationship with your mate? Your children? Your parents? Your siblings? It may be a matter of the state of the &quot;love tank&quot;.<br />Author Gary Chapman in his book The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate believes everyone has a love tank, and that tank is filled by different love languages. These five languages are Gifts, Words of Affirmation, Quality of Time, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch.<br />Often, we tend to give love in the languages we are most fluent in, which usually ends up being the languages that fill up our love tank. This would be why a husband who does yard work, dishes, car maintenance, etc. (Acts of Service) is floored when his wife says &quot;You never show me you love me. You never cuddle with me, or caress my hair, or make the first move for sex.&quot; (Physical Touch). Or, &quot;Why don't you spend time with me? Why do you work so much?&quot; (Quality Time). And, &quot;Why don't you buy me flowers? Why don't you ever get me cards or balloons...just because?&quot; (Gifts) Or &quot;You never tell me what I mean to you. Why don't you ever share with me what I mean to you, or what my good qualities are?&quot; (Words of Affirmation) But, if her language is primarily Acts of Service, she'll feel so loved and honored because her husband does so many things for her, and thus feels &quot;full&quot; in her love tank.<br />This may not sound like a big deal, but considering the divorce rate is 50% (as one relationship instance), and so many seem to be unhappy with their primary relationships, the concept of love languages may very well be a signficant factor in understanding self and others, and in relationship growth. Perhaps relationships get rocky or arrive at an impasse because individuals are speaking a different love language than what fills up the &quot;love tank&quot; of the object of their affection...and a result, the recipient doesn't feel loved. It's not that they feel empty and unfufilled because love isn't being given, but because the language &quot;spoken&quot; is not something that registers to the recipient as a form of love.<br />Chapman further theorizes that we usually have 2 main love languages that fill up our tank. He also says that if a person has a hard time identifying their main love languages, they've either been on empty for so long and are out of touch with their needs, or they have been so filled up by their spouse, that all 5 languages tend to speak to them equally.<br />A story in the book that illustrates the love tank theory is the &quot;burnt toast syndrome&quot;. A woman was sick in bed. Her husband would always bring her burnt toast to her when she was ailing. She was so hurt and offended by this repeated insensitivity and ignorance, that she finally burst into tears one day, and asked him why he did that...and didn't he care? She was floored to hear him say &quot;I'm sorry honey. I had no idea. Burnt toast is my favorite, and I gave you what I would consider my favorite breakfast...burnt toast.&quot;<br />Chapman writes: &quot;When your spouse's emotional love tank is full and he feels secure in your love, the whole world looks right and your spouse will move out to reach his highest potential in life. But when the love tank is empty and he feels used but not loved, the whole world looks dark and he will likely never reach his potential for good in the world.&quot;<br />I recommend this book highly.

Chapman, with co-writer Ross Campbell, M.D., have written The Five Love Languages Of Children, which applies the love language theory to children. How can you tell your child's main love language? Chapman offers these suggestions:<br /><br />1. Observe how your child expresses love to you.<br /><br />Chapman and Campbell: Watch your child; he may well be speaking his own language. This is particularly true of a young child, who is very likely to express love to you in the language he desires most to receive.<br /><br />I've seen this with my own 4 1/2 year old. Noah will come up to me or my husband, and try to engage us in a wrestling match. Or he'll pat our arms, give us a hug, etc. He has shown us that his main love language is that of Physical Touch!<br /><br />2. Observe how your child expresses love to others.<br /><br />If you notice your child making crafts for relatives, or wanting to take presents to classmates or teacher, this may indicate that her primary love language is Gifts.<br /><br />3. Listen to what your child requests most often.<br /><br />If your child often asks you questions like &#34;How do I look, Mommy?&#34;, &#34;What do you think of my drawing?&#34;, or &#34;Did you think I did well at practice today?&#34;, this pattern may indicate that his love language is Words of Affirmation.<br /><br />4. Notice what your child most frequently complains about.<br /><br />Frequent complaints such as &#34;You never have time for me&#34;, &#34;Why don't you play games with me?&#34;, or &#34;We never do things together&#34; would be indicative of the need for Quality Time.<br /><br />5. Give your child a choice between two options.<br /><br />Chapman and Campbell suggests to lead your child to make choices between two love language. For example, a Dad might say to his son, &#34;I have some free time Saturday. Would you like me to fix your bike, or would you rather go to the park together and shoot some hoops?&#34;. The choice is between Acts of Service and Quality Time. A mother may say, &#34;I have some time tonight. Would you like to go shopping, and I'll help you pick out a new outfit, or would you rather stay home and we'll do a puzzle together?&#34; You've given her the choice between Gifts and<br />Quality Time.<br /><br />Chapman and Campbell explain: As you give options for several weeks, keep a record of your child's choices. If most of them tend to cluster around one of the five love languages, you have likely discovered which one makes your child feel most loved. At times, your child will not want either option, and will suggest something else. You should keep a record of those requests also, since they may give you clues.<br />Of course, the choices you offer your child will depend on age and interest.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for understanding your child's own unique love languages, and how you can better fill his or her &#34;love tank&#34;!p you pick out a new outfit, or would you rather stay home and we'll do a puzzle together?&#34; You've given her the choice between Gifts and  Quality Time.

She contends that disease is caused by mental thought patterns, especially patterns of criticism, anger, resentment, and guilt. Festering resentments eat away at the self and can ultimately lead to tumors and cancers. Anger turns into things that burn, boil, or infect the body. A pattern of criticism can turn into diseases like arthritis, and guilt seeks punishment and leads to pain. In this book, Ms. Hay outlines hundreds of diseases and conditions, alphabetically, and the mental patterns that are associated with them, including each vertebrae of the spine. She has discovered these patterns through many years of study, her own work with clients, and her lectures and workshops.<br />She knows the power of healing by changing mental thought patterns firsthand: she was diagnosed as having cancer of the vagina several years ago. She was already a teacher of healing for several years, and saw it as an opportunity to practice what she preached. Despite knowing the power of replacing negative thought patterns with positive and affirming beliefs, she felt panic like most would at this kind of diagnosis. However, she felt that if she allowed the doctor to operate without changing the mental pattern that created it, the cancer would just come back. In fact, she believes that when cancer comes back, it's not because the doctor \\"didn't get it all\\", but because the individual never addressed the mental patterns that created the dis-ease in the first place.<br />In Ms. Hay's case, she had never acknowledged the deep resentment she carried for being raped when she was 5 years old and being battered as a child. As she says, we are often blind to our own patterns--even if we're healers or teachers.<br />Ms. Hay bargained with her doctor and asked for 3 months to work on the deep resentments and thought patterns that created her cancer. He grudgingly agreed, warning her that she was putting her life in danger. She began working immediately with a teacher to clear up her patterns of resentment, as well as working with a nutritionist to detoxify her body. Six months later, the medical profession agreed with what she already knew: she was completely free from any form of cancer.<br />She still keeps the original lab report as a reminder of how negatively creative she could be.<br />I have to admit, I never thought I would recommend this book to anyone. My first husband was a Charismatic minister who believed that words were powerful and creative, and taught this concept to his congregation. However, he contracted leukemia at age 28, and despite a lot of positive thinking and affirmations, he suffered physically and died. Entertaining the theory that he created his suffering, especially after believing in God, healing, and the power of words, made me mad. Very mad. I scorned Ms. Hay and her theories of blame.<br />So what changed my mind? I had a series of physical symptoms that I knew were connected to my beliefs and thought patterns. As a former Charismatic minister, I used to teach the same thing as my deceased husband. However, deep down, I don't think I really believed in co-creation, but just wished it were true--especially in the area of prosperity and \\"name it and claim it.\\" After following a different spiritual path from the one in which I was raised and upon further metaphysical study and reading while working on my own thought patterns, I began to realize, deep down, that my thoughts were powerful and that there were mental and emotional correlations to my physical symptoms. It was then that I felt to give Louise Hay another try.<br />First off, let me say that Ms. Hay believes in taking full responsibility for your health without self-reproach of feeling guilty. The means NO BLAME. But if you're anything like me, especially one that struggles with guilt from being brought up in a fear-based religion, it's hard not to feel blame when exploring the ideas of metaphysical causation. Some people blame God or an evil entity for dis-ease, and others blame it on the environment, poor lifestyle choices or genetics. Ms. Hay doesn't believe in participating in self-loathing and self-blame when you get ill; this is yet another destructive thought pattern.<br />I bought Heal Your Body a few months ago, and I have to tell you, it's really helped me pinpoint issues I needed to acknowledge and work though. I was suffering sinus trouble, and sinus trouble supposedly correlates to being irritated by one person--someone close. I began to look at the fact that I held unacknowledged resentment towards my Autistic son because of the arduousness of dealing with his behaviors, as well as wishing my situation was other than it was. What mother wants to acknowledge she may resent her son on some level--especially a precious 4 year old with Autism? Yet, this is what becoming responsible for myself and my health entails: ruthless self-examination without self-judgment and self-blame. Then, it's possible to actually work on the root of the resentment, see where I was resisting reality and wishing it to be other than it is, and changing my mind and negative thought processes.<br />Needless to say, after a few months of working on it, the sinus trouble disappeared. (And it was plaguing me for many months.) I've had this work for me with other ailments, as well.<br />If anything, this book is a great starting point for examining our beliefs and thought patterns and observe if there is truth to Ms. Hay's correlations. If it doesn't seem to fit, sit with it awhile. Be honest with yourself. Allow yourself to explore the idea that it's possible. You may find some surprising insights into your health and your life, and begin on a path to a level of health that you never imagined possible.of metaphysical causation.

According to this excellent book by Jan Purser: \\"Meditation is very simply the ability to focus on one thing only, allowing thoughts and inner chatter to fall away, leaving a deep feeling of stillness and peace...Meditation is not an escape from life or reality. In fact, it is the opposite. When you meditate, you don't cease to hear sound, act responsibly, or feel emotions. You become even more alert and focused, and less reactive, but more responsive with emotional issues.\\"<br />Are you a candidate for the benefits of mediation? According to Purser, meditation will help you live a more peaceful life if you:<br />*Feel as though just one more demand on your time may \\"break the camel's back\\"<br />*Are often fearful of change or new experiences<br />*Have inappropriate emotional outbursts or reactions<br />*Overreact to stressful situations<br />*Sleep poorly or suffer with insomnia<br />*Often feel scattered or unfocused in your activities<br />*Have lost a loved one recently<br />*Worry that you can't meet the demands of your job or personal life<br />*Find that your children are too much to handle<br />*Have trouble communicating peacefully with others<br />*Feel as though your life is monotonous and routine<br />*Experience a lack of balance between your work and reacreation activities<br />*Are experiencing a relationship breakdown<br />*Suffer from mild depression<br />*Feel as though your life is lacking direction and purpose<br />*Suffer with a chronic illness and are dealing with its associated pain<br />*Have been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness<br />*Would like to have more concentration when doing creative tasks<br />*Would like to feel calm and peaceful more often<br />*Wish to improve your performance at a sport or physical activity.<br />This slim hardback book is just as much a joy to look at as it is to read.

Sounds too good to be true? It isn't. I have been a student of psychology, personality and spirituality ever since I was a young girl.

My intellect likes mind candy and the accumulating of knowledge, but it wasn't enough to put me over the edge to freedom.<br /><br />But this book did.

Archetypes are energies and characteristics we us to fulfill our specific contracts in the world. We use archetypal language every day: \\"I'm tired of fighting this!\\" (Warrior), or \\"She acts like the Queen of England\\" (Queen) etc. It's not hocus pocus...it's the realization that we take on certain energies and dramas in our life that assist us in our individual Who and Why. Many Archetypes \\"dance\\" with each other...Knight with Damsel, Rescuer with Addict, Student with Teacher, Bully with Victim, etc.<br /><br />Whether we live once or many times, it's a feasible theory to believe that we've made agreements with God, and perhaps others, to live out certain dramas in the journey of our soul's wisdom.<br /><br />When casting the Wheel, Archetypes land in 1 of 12 Houses...each House corresponding with the Astrological Chart Houses and what each entails. It's amazing to see where Archetypes land, and in which House! For example, my Queen landed in the 1st House of Ego and Identity, and if you'd see the jewelry I wear, how \\"commanding\\" I am, and how I carry myself...you'd suspect Queen energy! Myss also teaches about the 7 chakras, including an 8th chakra that deals with \\"symbolic sight\\", or, seeing things from a God's eye view. She also correlates chakras with the Houses, and what issues fall in which chakras.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book for insight into life patterns, life purpose, the archetypal patterns of others, and how relationships \\"dance\\" with one another to the tune of specific soul lessons. While I'm not 100% sold on the idea that our Natal Wheel contains 12 fixed archetypes--and that they can be selected, with surety, simply by asking questions of archetypal patterns and then choosing their house placement by random--it's a fascinating system that will yield helpful clues as to why you do what you do...and why you are here this moment.ye view.

It identifies how the root of  rejection manifests itself in many thought and behavior patterns...and how  to successfull identify and &quot;pull&quot; that root.
