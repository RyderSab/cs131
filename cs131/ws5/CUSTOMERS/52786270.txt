It is a workbook with about 30 consumable or reproducible pages printed in black and white on lower quality paper.  (The inside title page gives copyright okay for reproducing the pages for a single classroom's use.)  There are approximately four problems per page with about two inches between each problem for making notes or diagramming the problem.<br /><br />The publisher's home page provides an image of one page of four problems, including the following:<br /><br />\\"18.  Rocky and Terrible are a bird and an elephant.  Rocky weighs more than Terrible.  Who is what?\\"<br /><br />This book also includes math \\"word problems\\" along the lines of, If this thing is ten inches long and that one is five inches longer, how long is that one? (not a direct quote).<br /><br />Although the problems are quite easy for adults (and if there are any that do have you scratching your head, there is an answer key in the front geared towards parents or teachers and a strategy guide in the back for students), they are useful for introducing logic problems to younger children.  They are easy enough to prevent extreme frustration, but they allow a child to build up skills in deductive reasoning.<br /><br />Susan Bauer in \\"The Well Trained Mind\\" recommends that parents or teachers start their children off with this level no matter what their ages.  I disagree with that; I believe most older children would find these problems much too easy.  I would advise parents to look at the problems on the publisher's website and determine whether their children are at or beyond that level before purchasing this book.<br /><br />It is a good, simple workbook to introduce young children to skills that will help them on many tests for years to come.	2005-04-06

(Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science 2)	Books	5	34	34	N	N	Read it as a story or do the experiments	The good thing about this book is that it is interesting enough to read it (at bedtime, for example) without pausing to do the experiments or you can use it in conjunction with some great little experiments to learn more about magnets.<br /><br />It is not extremely detailed, but my five-year-old son found it quite engaging and he was absolutely fascinated when the experiments worked \\"just the way the book said!\\"  With the book's simple structure, I know it won't be too long before he is able to read it to himself, also.  (It is around the second grade level, I would say.)<br /><br />Nicely done for younger students.	2005-04-06

She looks in on many other animals getting their animal homes ready for the changing season (burrows and nests and such--a true to life story, not a fantasy tale such as \\"Peter Rabbit\\") and has a close encounter with a snake as a cold rain closes in.<br /><br />Not quite as engaging as some of the other titles in the DK Level 1 Readers (\\"Duckling Days\\" and \\"Born to be a Butterfly\\" come to mind in the animal life category), but still enjoyed.  As with others it has words featured in pictures within pictures, and these words also make it into a one-page picture dictionary at the end of the book.<br /><br />A note to the adults making this purchase on the behalf of beginning readers:  DK Level 1 Readers are more complex than most other Level 1 readers, featuring multi-syllable words (\\"dormouse\\", for example) and complex sentences common to most series' Level 2.	2005-03-30

The artwork appears to have been lifted from a comic book, complete with dialog balloons and sound effects, but the story is told in chapters in regular story format.

This is an early reader (Scholastic Level 3) with chapters and regular printed page words.  The illustrations appear to be from comic books and include dialog bubbles and storyline trailers, but don't pick this up expecting a comic book.<br /><br />My son, a huge Batman fan, loves this book and other books of this series.  (\\"The Copycat Crime\\" is the second in the series, but I have not yet encountered anything that would require the books to be read in sequence.)  This villain in this book is The Riddler, who seems to have kidnapped a boy despite being in prison.<br /><br />The story is simple to fit it into 39 pages (the 40th page is devoted to vocabulary words), but quite well done and genuinely interesting despite its Easy Reader status.<br /><br />The best compliment my son has given it is, \\"I really like this book even though it's supposed to be good for me!\\"	2005-03-28

The writing is representative of the next 27 pages--contractions and some multi-syllable words add a bit of challenge to one who is just learning how to read, but the best thing about it is that it's fun!<br /><br />The emphasis is NOT on simple writing.  The emphasis is on the story, which is a simplified version of the first Spider-Man movie:  the Green Goblin only shows up in one picture and is not named--the book emphasizes how Peter Parker became Spider-Man and what he can do now that he's been bitten by a \\"man-made spider\\".<br /><br />My young son summed it up best when he said, \\"This is a SUPER book, Mommy.

My son, currently five years old, isn't sure about coloring books.  His usual modus operandi was to make a couple of marks within the coloring page, then turn it over and draw on the back.  I picked up this Anti-Coloring Book, the Fourth, on sale to see if he liked it any better.  He most certainly does--he LOVES it!<br /><br />\\"What do you need a fairy godmother to do for you?\\" asked the book.  My son immediately drew a picture of himself flying like a bird.  Then he decided to color in the fairy godmother's dress (she graces the upper left quarter of the page) because anyone who made him fly deserved to have a beautiful dress, he said.<br /><br />The next printed page (the pages are printed on only one side in case one needs to take one out to share) asked, \\"What would it look like if you could see what a skunk smelled like?\\"  My son proceeded to draw squiggly smell lines in browns and greens, adding a red saw and some blue smoke.  The skunk at the bottom of the page got a technicolor \\"smell paint job\\" as well.<br /><br />Other pages include the following (a selection of the 50 or so pages):<br /><br />You are a famous pilot flying on an important mission.<br /><br />What important things would you like to talk about with your parents?<br /><br />Why are these police officers weriting out a ticket?<br /><br />You have chartered a boat to sail to Paradise.<br /><br />Design your own train set.<br /><br />Each page has the \\"assignment\\" and a suitable line drawing that takes up only a portion of the page, roughly a fourth to a third for the most part.<br /><br />I will definitely pick up the others in the series and look forward to many more smiles from my son.  I believe that this series will serve him for several more years.	2005-03-07

He gets upset with Rudy Soto (the main character of this book) for taking a hawk chick from its nest, but enjoys the end when he sets him free and the hawk and the boy \\"talk\\" back and forth to each other.  Like Rudy, my son thinks maybe there are some people out there who really do know how to fly...<br /><br />The Caldecott-winning drawings are simple line drawings that evoke the idea of flight (or being grounded on occassion).  The text accents the drawings--<br /><br />It is<br /><br />broken<br /><br />into<br /><br />many<br /><br />short<br /><br />lines,<br /><br />which<br /><br />draw the<br /><br />eye up to<br /><br />the top of<br /><br />the pages.<br /><br />It becomes a single free-verse poem of flight.  The combination of the story, the exact words chosen, and the pictures have let to many discussions with my son already and he has only had this book for a couple of weeks.  Highly recommended!	2005-03-03

In Jungle Jeopardy	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A fun book	My three-year-old son loves Scooby Doo cartoons and I was pleased to find books related to the series that work well as books.<br />It's a standard Scooby Doo plot:  the kids go to visit one of Daphne's teachers, Professor Peabody, who is on an archeology dig in Central America.  He is searching for a lost Mayan pyramid, and when the gang starts getting close ferocious cat creatures try to chase them away.  I'll let you guess the ending.  *smile*<br />Things I like about this book include the following:  a relatively high number of words per page (in other words, there is a lot of reading to be done in addition to looking at the pictures); real places and civilizations are used in the book (it really talks about the Mayans in Central America); and a couple of facts about bats are thrown in as part of the plot (vampire bats go after some fruit instead of Shaggy and Scoob).  In addition, the bold pictures run right to the edge of the pages, making the book very attractive.<br />The things I don't really care for in this book are rather minor:  the type is in an unusual font (which poses no problems while I'm reading the book to my son, but which may cause problems for beginning readers) and Shaggy's and Scooby's speech patterns are captured in print (like, Shaggy starts a lot of sentences with \\"like\\" and Scooby starts almost all of his words with \\"r\\").<br />All in all, this may not be great literature, but it's a very fun book that my son requests quite often.  It's great to bridge the gap between TV and reading.	2003-02-23

Fortunately, there are enough snippets of information that an adult can tailor the words to fit the child as she or he reads aloud.<br />The photos, though, are what make this book so attractive.  Each type of aircraft (to include experimental aircraft, Chinook helicopters, and future space-shuttle-like craft)has a two-page spread of photos in this oversized book.  Most types feature at least three photos:  one from the side, one from directly in front (the SR-71 Blackbird and the jumbo jet are particularly striking!) and one from the rear.  Every type of aircraft has a photo taken while flying.<br />My young son is learning that jet planes don't have propellers and that rocket engines look different from jet engines.  Of course, at first, he was more interested in the striking colors of the aircraft chosen for the photos, but this book allows him to grow.  He has a while yet before he learns \\"it all\\", unlike some of the other airplane books for young children.<br />An enthusiastic thumbs up!	2002-06-30

My two-year-old son loves this book but he has already destroyed more than fifty percent of it after two months of use.<br />This book has many interesting features, from radio sets connected by string, to \\"radar blips\\" on a screen in a cockpit, little planes \\"flying\\" through the sky, to a steering wheel that changes the view out windscreen as you \\"come in for a landing--and that isn't even half of the activities in the book.<br />The problem is that it requires a high degree of fine motor skill to operate many of the activities.  The \\"radar blips\\" were difficult for me to spin, for example, and the steering wheel kept getting stuck until mommy tore it in one of her many attempts to \\"Fix it!\\" under pressure.  My son also removed all of the little \\"flying airplanes\\" in less than a week of play.<br />Don't get me wrong--my son still LOVES this book, despite the fact that it is now falling apart!  He has a blast using the things that still work, and explaining to me how the things that are broken used to work.<br />I would recommend waiting until a child is at least four before buying this book for them unless they are very careful players or there will be parental help all the time it is in use.<br />And, I would like to add that the girls in my son's playgroup loved this book as well--it is DEFINITELY not just for boys!	2002-04-09

This book is great for letting toddlers know what it is like to fly on an airplane, whether it is in preparation for their first flight, reminiscence of previous flights, or just for their imagination.<br />The illustrations are clear and the story is simple.  The text is presented in a very clear and large typeface that beginning readers should find quite easy to sound through. The things that are important to a young child are emphasized, such as finding a seat and getting a meal--and the teddy bear is a prominant character that my son really seems to like.<br />It may not be a great piece of literature, but it is a very enjoyable little book!	2002-04-09

Books	4	0	0	N	Y	Great for introducing a slightly longer story	I wasn't sure this was a great purchase for my two-year-old at first:  there are a lot more words per picture than in his other books.  But he surprised me by loving it!<br />In contrast to Byron Barton's books, which are very realistic accounts of airplanes and airports, Harman and Payne create an imaginative world that assumes that different airplanes have personalities.  In this book, Artie is introduced as a little plane who loses his job when a road is built to the small town he serves.  The other planes turn up their noses at him until he becomes the only one who is able to be a rescue plane and save his small town in a snowstorm.  It is an engaging story with a gentle moral.  Very agreeable.<br />It took us several tries to make it all the way through with my two-year-old, but now he loves it and is becoming interested in books with more and more words per picture.  I think an older child would enjoy it right off the bat, and I think the way the print is laid out would make it easy for a beginning reader to navigate.	2002-04-09

Will there be enough room?\\"<br />The simple, rhythmic text of this book just begs to be chanted as you read it to your young child.  Go ahead and lose your self-consciousness and do it:  Your child will love the book and learn the alphabet to boot!<br />The story line is simple:  the lower case letters pass along the word that everyone is going to climb to the top of the coconut tree.  Just after z makes it up the tree, \\"Uh-oh!  Oh, no!  Chicka chicka BOOM BOOM!\\"  The uppercase letters come along to \\"hug their little dears and dust their pants.\\"  I understand this is where the board book version of this story ends, but I would highly recommend that you buy the regular version instead.<br />In the full-length version, the lower case letters get up from the jumble with all their bumps and bruises and head home.  But after the sun goes down, \\"a gets out of bed and this is what he said, 'Dare, Double Dare!  You can't catch me!  I'll beat you to the top of the coconut tree!'  Chicka Chicka Boom Boom!\\"<br />If you have fun with it, your young children will love to listen to it.  The alphabet is printed in its entirity (upper and lower case letters) in the fly leaves of the book, and these are great to point to while singing the alphabet song or play a quick game of \\"What's that?\\" before or after reading the book.  And your child will quickly start to chant the story along with you, I'm sure!<br />I, for one, was thrilled when my two-year old started bringing it to me and saying, \\"Read it, Mommy!  Read it, the Boom Boom!\\"  He's learning his letters and having fun.  For what more could I ask?	2002-04-05

He recognizes the symbol used to indicate time to squeak the toy and sometimes even does it at the right time.<br />All in all, I'm very impressed with this book as both a toy and a book.

The words are a bit heavy for him yet, but he loved the pictures.<br />The illustrations in this book are absolutely marvelous.  Swirling yellows surrounding a smiling, dancing main character and a beautiful full moon in a rich night sky are two of the illustrations that stand out in my mind.  The sky is a backdrop for a little girl's activities, from learning to ride a bicycle to a quiet moment in the night.  The layers-deep pictures are what caught my son's eye, but one of the things that I liked about them was that the little girl who is the main character has dark skin, but that fact is not in the least the emphasis of the illustrations or the story.  The author and illustrator have made a universal story around a character who does not happen to be white.  I was quite impressed.<br />The words are inspirational, The sky's responses encouraging a child to go out and dance or learn to ride a bike.  In the end, the sky says that surely it is big enough that all of the earth's inhabitants can live under it in peace, and on the last page of the main text the reader pictures the little girl being grown up and saying, &quot;I believe....&quot;<br />The final page of the book shows the text of Psalm 19:1-4a surrounded by the little girl's paintings.  This is the only direct reference to a particular religion, the remainder of the book being inspirational and spiritual without being religious.  The Psalm text itself speaks of the heavens glorifying the name of God.  Personally, I would not have included that text in order to be sure that readers outside the Judeo-Christian world read the book, but it is a lovely Psalm.<br />This is a beautiful book that children younger than four years will enjoy as well as their older siblings and that parents will enjoy reading aloud.	2001-11-20

I would recommend this book to all families who experience a loss of a loved one or who wish to introduce their children to prayer.  Bereaved adults might also benefit from this book; reading it brought back memories of my father and walking and talking with him.<br />Buy this book for your children and read it to them for yourself.

My two-year-old son absolutely adores this book, even though the writing is directed at children above his age.  He wants to go through the alphabet over and over with me (and yes, there are airplanes for every letter, including the Xandu and the Yak), stopping at his favorites.  No jet aircraft are included in this book, with the possible exception of the Osprey, which the text admits is an unusual inclusion in the book; however, both military and civilian propeller-driven airplanes are included.<br />The text, as I mentioned, is clearly aimed at children older than two.  I am very pleased with the text; it is clear and simple but it doesn't talk down to young readers.  It gives interesting tidbits of information about the various aircraft and explains the basics of how airplanes fly.<br />Although each letter is prominantly featured in both upper and lower case, the focus of the book is really not the alphabet.  The alphabet forms a backdrop and theme for the gorgeous illustrations of airplanes.  The realism and minute detail make this a book older children, who already know the alphabet, would like to possess.  In fact, I know quite a few adult aviation fans who would love to receive this as a holiday gift!  My son easily spends a half an hour to forty-five minutes just looking at the pictures--a VERY high compliment from any two-year-old.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves airplanes.  It would not be my first choice for teaching my son the alphabet, but he is certainly learning to love books and to love airplanes!	2001-11-14

It is fully a how-to, encourage the people who want to breastfeed book.  If you have already decided to breastfeed, or if you are reasonably sure you want to breastfeed and are looking for a few more arguments in its favor, get this book.  If you are sitting on the fence or looking for assurances that formula-fed babies are going to do just as well in life as a breastfed baby, don't buy this book.<br />For the record, although I breastfed my son and would recommend it to anyone who was expecting a child, I am not of the opinion that those who feed their children formula have doomed their children to failure.  There are plenty of perfectly well adjusted formula-fed babies out there--including me!  That is one sentiment that is not expressed in this book, however, so do be warned.<br />However, this book will give you all sorts of tips and descriptions of ways to continue breastfeeding or expressing milk to feed your child.  Some folks seem to give up on breastfeeding after a bit of difficulty; it is important to realize that breastfeeding is something you have to LEARN how to do.  If you and your baby magically fall into perfect step the first time you try breastfeeding and you have had no one tell you how it's done, you are very lucky!<br />This book clearly describes how to get your baby to take the breast, what to do if it hurts (it ought not hurt!  If it does that means you need to change your technique), and how to make sure that your baby is getting enough milk.  It gives you hints about clothes to wear to allow you to breastfeed and ways to minimize your exposure when you breastfeed in public.  It is a bit repetative, but it is not really meant to be read from cover to cover.  It works much better as a resource you pick up and read sections of at a time.<br />Once again, it is unabashedly pro-breastfeeding, and it has a chapter on breastfeeding a toddler as well as plenty of discussion about how much better breast milk is for the baby than formula is.  This all comes in handy if you're trying to convince some busy-body that you're doing the right thing by breastfeeding, but if you've honestly determined that breastfeeding is not for you, you should save yourself grief and avoid this book.<br />If, on the other hand, you want to breastfeed your baby but aren't sure that you can, DO buy this book!

We barely got through &quot;My World&quot; once.<br />The rhymes simply don't click and the story is not interesting enough to make up for it.  I believe the illustration that made my son ask the most questions was one of toothbrushes hanging by strings on nails in the wall.  He had never seen such a thing, but seemed interested in the prospect of putting his toothbrush on the wall.<br />I suppose that was the reason he really didn't get interested in the book: he didn't identify with it.  His daddy doesn't go fishing or sit on the front porch smoking his pipe.  Now, he's never become a sailboat as the bunny in &quot;Runaway Bunny&quot; did either, but he was interested in the idea; it captured his imagination.  &quot;My World&quot; didn't.<br />Perhaps there are some children who might enjoy this, but definitely take it out of the library first before you buy it.	2001-11-06

This work is not of the caliber of &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, but it is a thoroughly enjoyable book, one that gives the reader a taste of life in the Roman Empire.<br />The main character is a self-centered lawyer, Nicole, who is not at all likeable.  The beginning of the book establishes her as the poster child for a woman having a bad day, after which she makes the mistake of wishing for &quot;the good old days&quot; of ancient Rome as she looks at a votive plaque on her nightstand.  The god and goddess depicted thereon take it upon themselves to grant her that wish.<br />Nicole wakes to find herself in the body of her distant ancestor, Umma.  The descriptions of this world and the people who live in it are what drew me in so completely.  This was a world where Family mattered, because it was likely that they were the only ones who could help you out in a crisis.  Death was familiar; cleanliness unknown.<br />I never did grow to like Nicole, even though she grew less self-absorbed toward the end of the book.  Her character seemed somewhat detached throughout, as though she were looking at her own life as a case study.  She showed no great emotion at the deaths of friends or family.  Still, I found the lessons that she learned interesting.<br />This is a great rainy weekend book.  At 600+ pages, it isn't a short read, but it is quick and easy.  In short, a fun and historically accurate book.	2001-06-19

Favorite at Our House	My son (currently 17 months old) has loved this book since he first layed eyes on it four months ago.<br />Each animal in this zoo is represented by a baby dressed up in an animal costume.  My son first payed attention to the baby faces in the book and has since started pointing to the costumes and the various aspects of the animals that are pointed out in the book.  That sounds a bit dull when I write that, but it's really quite fun to watch and listen to him exclaim over moose antlers and crocodile tails.  I'm more than happy to read it over and over again for that reason, as well as the fact that I think the pictures are quite cute, too.<br />If I had to make a complaint it would be that the costumes are sometimes a little more representative than accurate.  That is, the peacock is dressed in a brilliant blue all over, which is different from the real bird.  But there are other books to teach my son that (as well as real zoos!).<br />This book is helping him to love books even more as he looks at the faces of the other babies and the costumes they are wearing.	2001-02-12

Unfortunately, it came nowhere near meeting my expectations.<br />Perhaps I expected too much.  I suppose a part of me was comparing it to Steinbeck's &quot;Travels With Charlie,&quot; which isn't really fair.  &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; is really meant to be a witty account of the author's travels through America in search of The Perfect Small Town.<br />Unfortunately, the one thing that struck me most in this book was that Bill Bryson spent an awfully large amount of time driving in his car being bored.  He makes snide remarks about every person he meets who doesn't immediately welcome him to the community (and even about the few who do) but his description of his appearance and of his conversations with the locals lead me to wonder whether anyone in his or her right mind would really want to talk to him at all.<br />I did make it through the entire book, and I did chuckle a few times, but I am still looking for that witty update to &quot;Travels with Charlie.&quot;	2000-10-26

Boynton starts with one dog (&quot;Woof!&quot;) and progressively adds a dog and a sound until on the last page she ends with ten dogs with ten distinctive barks...and one cat in the corner.<br />My son loves to hear all of the different dog noises as interpreted by his mom, who is willing to ham it up for the little guy.  After we've read it a few times he happily goes to the last page and woofs and arfs quietly to himself (he's just over a year old).  A word of warning, though:  when his dad tries to read this book to him in a much more laid back manner than I do, my son impatiently pats the book and tells daddy sternly, &quot;Woof!&quot;<br />I'm not sure if my son is learning to count from this book, but he surely is learning to love reading.  Read this one where you can have fun with it.	2000-10-03

The oil paintings are absolutely fabulous.  However, they are a little dark and my niece seems to have a hard time relating to them at times.<br />The story is good, but not excellent.  The relationship between the main character and her grandmother is very well drawn.  However, the book wavers between real life and the dream world.  At the end of the book when the whales call the main character's name, we had to answer questions about whether the girl was going to live with the whales forever because they had called her.<br />This is not a bad book, but a bit too disquieting to become a favorite for us.	2000-10-03

Dr. Seuss' original book is a wonderful, rhythmic book.  That book is suggested for children four to eight years old.  It is NOT the same as the  Bright and Early Board Book which will pull the same reviews here on  Amazon.com as the original book!<br />The board book is an abridged version of  the Dr. Seuss favorite.  It is not a bad book (my son has fun with the  board book which he received as a gift and likes to hear grandma make the  sounds Mr. Brown makes).  However, it is in no way as detailed as the  original (no gum-chewing hippo for example) and the rhythm doesn't quite  &quot;work&quot; in some places (&quot;...He can sound like a bee. Mr Brown  can buzz.  How about you?  Can you buzz? ...&quot;).<br />If I could separate  my reviews I would give the Bright and Early Board book Two Stars and the  Dr. Seuss original Four Stars.  Perhaps if I didn't know that the board  book was abridged I'd give it a higher score, but if you wish to make the  better purchase, I'd suggest you go with the original.	2000-09-08

We still have a running rivalry between &quot;Good Housekeeping  Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Better Homes  New Cookbook&quot; for Best Basic  Cookbook.  While each of these books has its strong points, my pick is  &quot;Good Housekeeping.&quot;<br />This cookbook is extensively illustrated  with photographs and line drawings, and features basic dishes as well as  more complicated recipes to challenge those who master the basics.  If  there is any possibility of confusion concerning a method, this book  presents words and drawings to guide the user precisely through the  process.  I also like the fact that there is a photograph of each dish--so  you know what your hard work is SUPPOSED to look like!<br />&quot;Better  Homes&quot; does seem to have a slightly larger number of basic recipes,  and I'm glad that we have both books in our home now, but when I have to  choose just one to give at a bridal shower or to a recent graduate, I  always choose &quot;Good Housekeeping Illustrated.&quot;	2000-08-17

From the first pages I was caught up in the world that  Guterson created.  I was sure I knew what the ending would be--and was  happily surprised to have been wrong up to the last moment.  It's not an  edge-of-your-seat book, but it is a very good novel.<br />I would echo  sentiments expressed in other reviews:  please don't be put off by the  movie!  Skip the movie and just read the book when you have the time to  read it through.	2000-08-14

This book is good fun.	I loved reading &quot;A Walk in the Woods.&quot;  It is laugh out loud  funny--and it holds up when you read excerpts to the person sitting next to  you when you cracked up.  Now I want to get out and walk the Appalachian  Trail...but not all at once!<br />Many folks have taken the time to write a  careful synopsis of this book, so you really don't need me to write another  one.  Bryson successfully blends narrative and fact into a truly  entertaining book.  Unfortunately, a recent trip to one of the areas  described in the book has revealed that at least one of his facts is  already out of date: more than 95% of the Frasier firs in Smokey Mountains  National Park have succumbed now to disease.  It makes me wonder how the  underground fire in Pennsylvania has progressed.<br />But up to the minute  accuracy isn't truly important for this book--just read it and enjoy the  story.	2000-08-14

I read it cover to cover in a week and then each month I reviewed the month.<br />This book, unlike &quot;What to Expect When You're Expecting,&quot; does  everything it can to lay your fears to rest.  Sears and Sears describe what  can go wrong, but they also make sure to emphasize that most women are  likely to have normal pregnancies.<br />I was able to find descriptions and  reasons for all of the odd sensations I experienced with my first  pregnancy, and I was able to share with a friend exerpts that described  different things she was experiencing.  After the third time I read  something to her from &quot;The Pregnancy Book&quot; that exactly fit her  symptoms, she decided that she needed her own copy and was completely won  over from &quot;What to Expect.&quot;<br />I cannot recommend this book highly  enough!	2000-07-22

My 10-month-old son picks it out of his book bag again and again.  He loves to turn the pages and runs his fingers over many of the pictures as if trying to pluck the items  off the page.  My personal favorite is number 8 (butterflies hiding in a  gorgeous bouquet of flowers), but my son seems to prefer the four rubber  bugs.<br />Another feature that I like about it is that the numbers go up to  twelve.  So many counting books end at ten; this is a welcome change.  The  only negative thing I can come up with is that it is sometimes a bit  challenging to find the identified number of things listed in the  illustration, but I think that will be part of the fun for my son as he  gets a bit older.	2000-07-22

Each page has the numeral, the spelled-out number, dots equal to the number, and a photograph illustrating the number.  Four different ways to illustrate a number on each page.<br />The problem is that it is not all that interesting.<br />Some of the  photographs are a bit fuzzy, as though they are extreme enlargements from  an original photo.  And it is just hard to get excited about nine beads on  a string, even though the photo is crisp and clear.<br />My son doesn't  dislike this book, but if I pick it out to be read he only wants me to go  through it once.<br />Another counting book that he seems to like a bit better  is &quot;Miss Spider's Tea Party : The Counting Book&quot; by David Kirk  and Antoinette White (Editor).  It is different from Tana Hoban's book in  that it is a story that also happens to illustrate counting, but my son  wants to hear that one over and over.	2000-07-22

She tells of her experiences at the front and in  the city of Leningrad while Nazi Germany held it under siege.  Shurik is  boy who lost his father at the front and who Kyra Petrovskaya first met as  he was digging through the rubble of a bombed apartment in a desperate  attempt to find his mother.  The author takes him in and tells the story of  the two of them living in Leningrad...Be prepared to discuss this book with  your children when they have finished it.  Like any realistic story of war,  there are parts of it that are disturbing, but well worth the read.	2000-07-08

The first thing he did was to pop it in his mouth--and with fourteeth he succeeded in giving it some good bite marks.  I rescued it before he could take a bite out of any of the shapes, but I believe that he could have.<br />Now that he is outgrowing the Must-Put-New-Thing-In-My-Mouth phase (ten months) he really enjoys the book.  He loves to take the shapes out of the book (one by one at mom's insistance!) and turn them over and over in his hands and look at them from all sides.  He also likes to turn the chunky but light pages and he is learning to point at the shapes when I say the corresponding sentence (&quot;Find the yellow triangle,&quot; for example).  I only wish there were more than four shapes in the book.<br />In short, I would recommend closely monitoring babies in the heavy chewing phase while they have this book, but it seems to be a great way for children to learn shapes and colors.	2000-07-08

Most of the photos and graphics  are very well chosen and enhance the reader's perception of the text.  Unfortunately, the reproduction quality of some of the photographs is less  than stellar, and the reader is left struggling to figure out what exactly  the point of the picture is.<br />Read this book to understand what  &quot;The Average Soldier&quot; (Ellis attempts to include facts about the  soldiers fighting on both sides) had to deal with in World War I (I think  re-enactors would find this book particularly useful), but select another  for the facts of the war or any particular battle.	2000-07-08

As long as the little house-shaped plastic pieces don't get stuck in the plastic tube  that holds them, visible through a cut-out on every page, it makes a nice,  gentle rattling sound, and there is a handy cut-out for a handle.<br />The  words are not extremely exciting.  Each page has a sound description  (&quot;A hammer goes tap, tap,&quot; for example), but the sounds are not  connected in any way that I could figure out (hammer to keys to a person  laughing...).  This sequence ends with &quot;My book goes rattle,  rattle.&quot;<br />It just doesn't hold my son's attention they way other  sound books do (try &quot;Mice Squeak, We Speak&quot; by Tomie dePaola for  animal sounds), but it does make an okay toy.	2000-07-04

Neither is a book I would choose to give another family, but &quot;Choo Choo&quot; is, in my opinion, the less  appealing of the two.<br />The rattle is a clear plastic box embedded in the  last page of the book with three car-shaped plastic pieces inside.  The  plastic pieces have a tendency to interlock and wedge in the end of the  plastic box, effectively elimiating the rattle.  When they are moving, my  son does like the gentle rattling sound they make.<br />The words describe  sounds that inanimate objects make, but they are not strung together to  make a story and I disagree with most of the choices of sounds.  For  example, taxis go &quot;beep, beep&quot; and cars go &quot;toot,  toot,&quot; but pickup trucks go &quot;vroom, vroom.&quot;  And when was  the last time you heard a motorcycle go &quot;zoom, zoom?&quot;<br />I would  recommend buying a rattle and buying another book (I'm still looking for a  good book on inanimate object sounds, but for animal sounds try &quot;Mice  Squeak, We Speak&quot; by Tomie dePaola) instead of buying this rattle  book.  If you insist upon getting a rattle book, I would recommend  &quot;Tick Tock&quot; (same author) over &quot;Choo Choo.&quot;	2000-07-04

It is one he can listen to over and over--and, fortunately, it's fun for me to read aloud to  him.<br />Each animal sound is introduced with a simple two-word sentance and  a colorful, full-page drawing of the animal.  The rhythmic, rhyming  passages, coupled with the fact that the pages are turned quickly (no more  than four words per two-page spread) make this a favorite for early  listeners or readers.<br />I highly recommend this book for young children to  introduce them to listening to and reading books.	2000-06-24

I thought this book would fill that  description, but it didn't quite fit the bill.  It has great photographs,  but no text.<br />Despite the catchy, rhyming title, each page shows  only a  picture of the item:  No rhyming text is involved.

The text focuses  equally on her perceptions of the people she meets and her perceptions of  her disguise.<br />I was impressed with the author's descriptions of the  people she met as well as her descriptions of the various decorative arts  she was studying, but I found her musings upon her disguise more  distracting than helpful.  I was most interested in her musings in her  epilogue in which she contrasted a later visit in veil with her trip  dressed as a man.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to know  more of the people who live in Iran regardless of the political situation.  I was particularly impressed with her record of discussions with religious  teachers.  The author's attention to detail made me want to read more about  the people of Iran after I had finished the book.	2000-06-20

He liked them both, though &quot;Black on White&quot; was clearly his favorite (he reached for that one more often  when they were both in front of him and there are far more tooth marks on  that book).<br />Still, the white silhouettes of familiar objects on a black  background did catch his interest when I turned the pages for him, and the  simple, two-color book did interest him early on.<br />As with &quot;Black on  White,&quot; however, I find that his interest in &quot;White on  Black&quot; waned when he turned about seven months old in favor of other,  more colorful books.<br />If you only want to buy one book of this type, I  would suggest going with &quot;Black on White.&quot;  However, I believe  the two books do provide a good variety for a very young infant.	2000-06-20

This book is not for the faint hearted, but if you truly want to learn to read, this is the book for you.<br /><br />Melville starts with the bones of a good story, adds the meat of interesting characters, and then augments that with layer upon layer of detail and symbolism, each of which is as rich (and as hard to bring home) as the whale oil the characters seek.<br /><br />If you love  MTV, you'll hate Moby Dick; it is not easy to get through and find the  plot.  But if you like poetry and enjoy searching for symbolism in deep  details, you will ultimately enjoy this book.<br /><br />My advice to those who are  looking for quick gratification and have been assigned this book for an  English class:  read the first hundred or so pages, then skip to the last  fifty.  This will give you the basic plot and let you enjoy the action.  Then  go back to the center pages you skipped (if you don't you will be  doing yourself no favors) and read those pages as you would poetry.  I must  admit that I wish I had done this the first time I read it:  I spent a good  long time wishing Ahab would please hurry up and catch his silly \\"fish\\" instead of listening to the language as I ought to have done.<br /><br />So  read this book and savor it.  It isn't the action-packed adventure about a  man and a whale that one might expect from the movies.  Instead it's a  thought provoking work about the nature of man.	1999-03-01
