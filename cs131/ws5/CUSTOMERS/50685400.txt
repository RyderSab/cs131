Her writing is crisp and clear, and crackles with authenticity. The dialogue is believable and true-to-life, and her characters are so real you feel as if you'd recognize them if you met them on the street.      <br />    The novels, featuring Mars Bahr (Candy Man) are guaranteed to keep you up late at night and to provide a satisfactory, if not always happy, ending. I enjoyed \\"Alone at Night\\". Presented with a cold case, the murder of a convenience store clerk, that at first seemed absolutely unsolvable, Mars Bahr and his assistant, Nettie Frisch, grind it out and develop clues which eventually lead to a solution of the years-old murder involving some very important people, people who are willing to kill again and again to hide their involvement. <br />     Don't miss this author. She deserves to be on the best seller lists, and if her publisher will promote her, I'm sure that's where she will eventually be. <br /> <br />	2005-02-04

Michael Devlin, the young sailor growing up after boot camp at his first duty station is a character with whom any of us who served in the military can identify. The characters at the Navy base are familiar and could have been found on any military base in any branch of the service. <br />     The love affair with Eden Santana is absorbing. The erotic passages are well done - you can almost taste and smell the sex. <br />     However, it is a little jarring when he gets some of the historical details wrong. Though the novel was set in 1953, he went on about the Dodgers moving to Los Angeles which didn't happen until April of 1958; wrote about James Dean and his famous red jacket from \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" which was released in 1955. <br />    These kinds of sloppy writing mistakes jar a reader out of his suspension of disbelief for a moment or two and make what otherwise would be a wonderful historical novel into just a pretty good one. <br />     Still a good read - but it could have been a great read.	2005-02-01

It fairly crackles with realism, and features fully realized, sympathetic characters who are easy for the reader to like and pull for. I am always happy when I pick a novel off the shelf and find a writer this good, and I'll watch for more of Ed Dee's work. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good fiction. I won't go into the story line, as that's been covered well by the other reviewers. I'll just say don't miss this one!	2004-10-29

He is not involved in the battle, is instead part of a support unit, and after a narrow escape, survives. This young officer goes on to an undercover operation for General Sherman in Cuba, is sent to Arlington for a tour tending the graves of the Civil War dead, and then is sent to South Africa as an observer, but is forced by circumstance to participate in several horrific battles in England's war against the Zulus. At all times, Lt. Michael Crofton conducts himself with honor and integrity, and such an admirable, likeable character that you just hate it when the novel ends - all too soon. <br /> I just loved this book, and look forward to more from Mr. Coplin. I heartily recommend this novel.	2004-07-30

I've read through the reviews submitted by other readers and I find myself agreeing with just about all of them - positive AND negative.<BR>If this doesn't seem to make sense, let me explain. I've been a Dean Koontz fan for over thirty years, since he was writing as Leigh Nichols and other pseudonyms when I could find them, and followed his career as he gradually blossomed into a writer of big fat best-sellers. I've enjoyed almost all of them.<BR>However, he is in danger of becoming a victim of style. He seems to search the thesaurus for synonyms that send me - and apparently hundreds of other readers - to the dictionary just so we can learn what the heck he is talking about. This is a distraction, and good writers avoid this kind of overkill. He plays with words and phrases, often to the detriment of the story and more often than not ends up irritating the reader with his cleverness. Okay, Dean, you've got a giant vocabulary and we're all impressed, but for Pete's sake, just tell the story in a clear and understandable way.<BR>He is in danger of becoming all style and little substance. Let's have the old Koontz - more story, more suspense, and maybe a bit less clever use of obscure words. Please.	2004-06-17

This advice is ignored totally by Wachtler and Gould in &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;. What could have been an exciting courtroom drama unfolds instead as a not very interesting narrative about an ex-clan member on trial for a forty-year old murder. Oh, the former clansman and the attorney representing him became &quot;blood brothers&quot; when they were 15, before the Jewish boy who became the attorney moved from Georgia to Brooklyn - hence the title.<BR>My beef with the novel is that it is basically just a long strung out narrative. Every scene that would have crackled with excitement and suspense if &quot;shown&quot; was simply &quot;told&quot;, to the detriment of the story. I love a good courtroom drama, and the heart of a good one is the trial, the testimony of the various witnesses and the way the attorneys conduct their examinations and cross examinations. Very little of this will be found in &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;. Only two or three witnesses are questioned so the reader can see what's going on; the rest of the trial is simply &quot;told&quot; to us.<BR>I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this one. Send these guys back to creative writing class!	2004-04-01
US	50685400	R21YD0VEJ2W04P	1400040752	17335739	Black Maps (John March Mysteries)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Hoping for more from this author	This book is a terrific debut by a new author, and I'm always thrilled to discover one who can write the way he can. His character, John March, is an ex-deputy sheriff turned private investigator working in New York city, and the case in Black Maps concerns financial shenanigans and blackmail at a very high level. Very well written and Spiegelman makes the world of high finance seem interesting - not an easy task, I'm certain. His characters are well developed and the plot, while complicated, is easy to follow.<BR>If I have any complaints, it is that he kind of over emphasizes his character's physical fitness: John March seems to live on tuna and yogurt and runs five to twenty miles every day. When he's not running, he's working out at the gym. I felt like saying, &quot;okay, okay, we know he's physically fit - now move on!&quot;<BR>But that's a small gripe and I feel almost guilty at mentioning it, since the book is so good otherwise. <BR>All in all, a very good read, and I hope to hear more from this author.	2003-11-26
US	50685400	R8Y98RKEMX4AK	039915079X	700072898	The Teeth of the Tiger (Jack Ryan Novels)	Books	2	3	6	N	N	The world according to Clancy	This novel reflects Tom Clancy's uncomplicated view of the world: it's us, the United States, against the bad guys, and anything we can do to kill, maim, or cripple the bad guys is all right, even to the extent of sending hit teams out to murder terrorists in other countries. This appeals to our sense of outrage at the terrorists, but unfortunately ignores the rules of civilization. As much as we would like to, we simply can't operate that way in the real world. In Clancy's fictional world, though, I suppose we can, and a large part of me rejoiced in the instant justice meted out by Clancy's young heroes of this novel.<BR>However, I think the editorial pukes at Putnam's Sons should take a hard look at their star author's writing style - after all, isn't that what editors are supposed to do? Every character in this novel speaks with the same voice - they all 'sound' the same, regardless of age or background. Everyone who is not a combat type is a 'puke', for example, no matter who is speaking.<BR>There is just no variation from character to character, so you have to check constantly to see who is speaking. And all the young protagonists say 'roger that' when replying to another, to the point it becomes annoying. His lack of expertise with firearms and ammunition is made painfully obvious by the awkward way he describes them at times. Pick up a \\"Shooter's Bible\\", Tom, and use it.<BR>Maybe this sounds like nit-picking, but I've read all Tom Clancy's novels, and while he desperately needs a good editor, he's really a much better writer than this. \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" was outstanding, and still stands as his best work as far as I'm concerned. <BR>The best that can be said for this novel is that it is much shorter than his usual tomes.	2003-11-17
US	50685400	R2N1I2EDC3CHQ2	0553802488	607743484	The Face	Books	2	8	12	N	N	Sorry, but &quot;The Face&quot; doesn't  do it for me	I've been a Dean Koontz fan for over 30 years,and have read his books from when he was writing as Leigh Nichols and other pseudonyms, when I could find them out. I've enjoyed his writing through all the changes he's gone through, and was pleased when his books started becoming best sellers. I've purchased dozens of his hardback novels, and many of the paperbacks<BR>    So I feel entitled to be critical when need be, and this is one of those times. &quot;The Face&quot; is a distracting novel in the same way the movie &quot;Traffic&quot; was distracting, and the TV series, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; is distracting. When you become more aware of the author than of the story and the characters, it is distracting. Just like when you're trying to watch a movie or TV drama and you're more aware of the tricky camera movements than you are of the unfolding story, you are distracted. And in &quot;The Face&quot;, Koontz distracts us by his writing style - it never just rains, it drizzles, weeps, torrents, mizzles, and so on. A pistol isn't a .38 or a .45, it is a trey eight or a four five. Cute, but I've never heard a gun referred to as a 'trey eight'.He must've written the book with an open thesaurus on his lap. If I have any problem with Mr. Koontz, it is this: as much as I usually love his books, he has never settled on a consistent style of his own. Some of his books are just beautiful. In others, he just doesn't quite get it together. He seems to be constantly experimenting.<BR>     Also, in this book, &quot;The Face&quot;, he has created this really evil villain who is out to kidnap the son of the 'world's biggest movie star' and torture him to death. And never at any time do we understand why this villain wants to do this. We are just supposed to accept that he wants to do it because he loves <BR>chaos, I guess. It didn't work for me. I wanted to know what motivated this evil character who seemed to have almost supernatural powers. It is never made clear to the reader, though.<BR>     So as much as I usually like Dean Koontz's novels, I have to say that I don't recommend this book. If you're new to Dean Koontz, try one of his earlier novels. You'll be much happier with them.	2003-08-16

Books	4	13	19	N	N	Entertaining, but some factual errors are distracting	Michael Moore's polemic against the Bush administration and white men in general is entertaining and often right on target, but some glaring factual errors distract one from his points.<BR>He says, for example, that a woman has never been a candidate for president or vice president in the United States.

She was Walter Mondale's running mate and a candidate for vice president.<BR>He also goes on at length about how things haven't gotten any better for the African American, which I don't believe is supported by the facts.<BR>Entertaining, yes.

I couldn't figure out whether Du Pre and Madelaine were married or just lovers and the book never made it clear. Du Pre runs around in a police cruiser complete with a light bar, is allowed by the local police to sleep in a crime scene, but has no police powers or offical status. He drinks ditches, whatever they are, and the only clue given by the novel is that they have whiskey in them. His reaction to almost anything that happens is to nod. &quot;Du Pre nodded&quot; must appear at least two or three times on every page.<BR>I hate to be negative in the face of all this praise but this book just doesn't do it for me. I like a bit more clarity in what I read. I can put up with the unusual dialect but I'd like to know who's married to who and why Du Pre drives a police cruiser but isn't a law enforcement officer and please, for God's sake, somebody tell me what a &quot;ditch&quot; is!	2002-08-05

I've long been an Elmore Leonard fan and appreciate his lean writing style and clever plotting. But it seems to me that with his last couple of novels he's been leaning heavily on his style and shorting us on substance. All flash but not much you can sink your teeth into.

One dimensional, unlikeable characters for the most part (Stone Barrington is a pleasure-loving sybarite who'd screw his brother's wife if he had the opportunity) and flat, unexciting stories. <BR>I hate to see it.

I was moved to tears several times in the reading of this novel and I heartily recommend it to anyone who is in search of something meaningful to read.

But as they became more and more popular, they began to read like treatments for a movie-of-the-week on TV, lacking the satisfying depth and characterization of his early works. Books that used to be a solid 350 pages, 125,000 words, now are barely 300 pages of widely spaced lines, probably not much more than 60,000 words. They're beefed up on thick paper to make the books look thick, like the old ones, but believe me, it's mostly pulp. I won't read the Parker books anymore, because they are disappointing, one long wise-crack with no suspense at all. &quot;Gunman's Rhapsody&quot; reads like the screenplay of &quot;Tombstone&quot; - some of the incidents depicted in the novel could literally have been lifted off the movie screen. There was nothing in the book that hasn't been in the movies, no new insights into the Earps or Tombstone or the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. I hate to say of it an author that I used to revere, but I think Mr. Parker has grown lazy, cashing in his reputation and writing about half as well as he is capable of. He needs to get back to his old self and write novels as good as he used to do.	2001-07-26

His characters are vivid and real and he is a master plotter. Why he is not an automatic best-seller author is beyond me, he is so much better than some of the authors who are always on the list. &quot;The Hearing&quot; is complex, satisfyingly long and very well plotted, typically Lescroart.

He's capable of wonderful writing.     Unfortunately, this Stone Barrington series, and especially the Stone Barrington character, reveals very little of his great talent. The character is a self-absorbed, shallow, utterly unadmirable womanizer with the morals of a snake and the heart of a hustler. I won't be reading any more of the Stone Barrington books.     This latest novel is very smooth and glib, like a dish of vanilla pudding, mindlessly pleasant as it goes down but ultimately unsatisfying. Every article of clothing Barrington wears is lovingly detailed for us; every luxury car and airplane, every beautiful woman, the menu of every meal is lingered over, making one wonder if Woods is as much a sybarite as his character. Too bad the story isn't as absorbing as it is smooth, and it's quickly forgotten.      I hate it when authors with huge talent churn out trifles like this, and I've seen it happen over and over. It's like they're just cranking out a quickie for another fat check and to hell with the quality. Where are their friends, their editors, their confidantes? They need to be told to get back to their writing roots, to write the way they are capable of writing. The kind of talent that has been given to Mr. Woods is rare and shouldn't be expended on such trifles.	2001-03-07

The basic idea is okay - a man wakes up, dressed like a bum, in Washington D.C., with no idea who he is or how he got there. Turns out he's actually a rocket scientist involved with the launch of the United States' first satellite. Unfortunately the story is filled with anachronisms (a Ford Fiesta in 1958 is one glaring one)and highly improbable plot devices. In one segment, a CIA agent fires several shots at our hero, in the dark, behind a large Washington hotel, then runs out and gathers up the spent bullets! However, the absolute worst, the point at which I felt like hurling the book against the wall, was the final chapter in which the moon landings took place. Follett has it happening on July 20, 1968! 1968! Is there anyone who doesn't know that the moon landings happened in 1969?? Is there an editor or fact checker working at this publishing house?  Mr. Follett, I've been a fan of yours ever since &quot;Key to Rebecca&quot; but you're going to have to do a hell of a lot better than &quot;Code to Zero&quot; to keep me.

I give the book a generous three-star rating because the writing, right up to the final chapter, is up to Patterson's usual high standard.

In order to enjoy fiction, one must be able to &quot;suspend disbelief&quot; and be caught up in the story along with the characters. Too many factual errors for me to maintain that  critical suspension of disbelief in this one. For example, Mr. Reich  describes a .45 caliber pistol as having nine bullets in the cartridge, one  in the chamber. Huh? A bullet IS a cartridge, and they go in the magazine,  or the clip. Little things like this are jarring, like seeing a soldier  with long hair curling over his ears in a movie about WWII - just not  realistic. Mr. Reich has a fairly good writing style, but he needs - badly  - a fact checker.	2000-07-05

I found this book very hard to get into, and in fact finally gave up on it after a very turgid 200+ pages. The author jumps from the 1940s to the 1990s at will and his characters are two dimensional and did not seem real  to me. The story had to do with the creation of a &quot;data haven&quot; in  the Phillipine Islands, but the author never fully explained the  significance of a data haven or why it would be important. The editors  should also do some fact checking. For example, I don't think the Special  Air Service (in the British Military) existed during WWII.  I had high  hopes for this book as I worked in a related area while in the Air Force,  but I was disappointed, and I'm afraid that many others will be as well.	1999-11-30
