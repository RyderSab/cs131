Kimberly is...a pain in the arse!<BR>Since about 40 pages are spent on her you'd think she was the main character. Considering that, she really does have more depth in her glassy eyes then Fiona has in her entire 6'0 frame as she flounces and pouts through page after page. Ace is no ace with me. I like my heroes somewhat smart and considering he was engaged to a dim witted blond who anyone could tell he wasn't really in love with (since hot potatoe style he ditched her for an equally whiny heroine, Fiona) makes me question his intelligence. Both of his girls'(Fiona and Lisa) also seem to dislike the swamp-a world Ace adores, which makes me wonder how much of his attraction to Fiona is just lust rather then love.<BR>I suggest The Taming and The Conquest by Jude Deveraux instead. Or may I suggest Judith McNaught and Karen Marie Moning.	2003-11-27

Heaven by a twist of fate escapes a house fire in this latest edition of this electric series. With a reluctant goodbye to Hiro she's off to the dazzle of Las Vegas where she seeks an old friend. In Las Vegas one can be blown wayward on their path and Heaven says Hello to an old friend-Katie and a new bubbly friend-Mr. Alcohol which she had a wild, reckless and ultimately humiliating relationship with in Book 3 The book of the Pearl (remember the jelly fish scene?). The alcohol misuse aside this is a fun, fast paced book. We see a new side of Teddy which makes him a more multi dimensional character and something very sweet and wonderful happens at the end (quess cuz I'm not going to tell!:) <BR>All in all a great book in the series.

This new Gaia seems softer, hanging off of Jack like a fuzzy Koala Bear. And speaking of their relationship, though they are alike physically and somewhat mentally their relationship lacks the spark (or rather the bonfire) that was Gaia and Sam or the sweetness of Gaia's relationship with her best bud, ex skater rat-Ed.<BR>Ed and Sam seem faraway from Gaia as is Pluto from the sun in these last few books. In the past books it was their relationship with Gaia that I though kept her from becoming complete cold and alienated and distrustful of humanity and now poof! They're gone. Now Gaia's basking in the Sun of a new Normal life but it's lacking the heat of Gaia's relationship's with these fine leading men. And just where the heck is Heather? I miss that girl!<BR>Don't get me wrong, Jake's a great guy-I mean he caught a bullet for this girl! But I was skimming the pages because it didn't have the tension and intensity of the earlier novels. Now Gaia and Jake are like a scum butt kicking team which sounds great but it's actually kind of boring because they're so much alike in someways. Gaia doesn't need a twin! This Bobbsy(however the heck you spell it) twin team didn't keep my eyes speeding across the page like Run for example or Gaia Abducted. And Gaia just seems different. Of course she's naturally graceful and strong but now she seems like a sterotypical Jock and if there's one way to describe the earlier Gaia is that she couldn't be sterotyped-she was in a class by herself!	2003-11-02

This book is a wonderful way to raise spirtual vibration. Elizabeth Prophet explains in a simple but profound way about how negativity can can get stuck in your being like tar, weighing you down. Alas! There is a simple but very effective way to cleanse yourself and raise your vibration-the violet flame. Like cleaning your teeth it's a very easy habit to include in your daily routine to cleanse yourself through and through and keep you healthy. Elizabeth Prophet in this book even shows how the violet flame has helped heal physical problems. It seems the experience is unique to each person who uses the violet flame but I will tell you that from my short experience I've already noticed more harmony and more flow in my life. No mind blowing results for me but rather quiet nudges from the universe that show me that the violet flame is working. <BR>I also like the part about the violet flame can be used to heal not only on a small scale but on a very large scale- meaning the entire Earth! Thank you Ms. Prophet for bringing this experience to me!<BR>I also suggest Doreen Virtue as a spiritual author to read. Her books about Angels and Ascended Masters is wonderful!	2003-10-31

This book is in desperate need of excitement juice!The book for me was a flat, parched desert land missing the excitment you'd find in the early series! Basically I remember the book like this: They, our three 'heroines'(eye roll insert here) end up at the the 'prison'. The heroines meet the evil, cackling headmistress who of course, is out to get them! They whine and pout as the evil characters circle them like vultures. They get thrown some magazines and then shock! shock! realize that the evil prison person uses the stupid magazines as way of manipulating them. Some wise old guy appears on the scene and gives them cryptic wisdom like bread crumbs scattered about to lead them home and they oommm meditate and escape the prison of their minds, they twirl in crazy circles after being dumped out in the desert and left to fry and cry but despite snakes and a fire they come through renewed.........and I wake up and realize this book was a real bonker of a snoozer and hope and pray that the next book will be good though i realize I'm just like those girls in the desert circling around and around and just as stupid cuz I keep reading on though imo the books haven't been that great after the Melody Series though the DeBeers was actually pretty good and gave me renewed hope so I trudge through the desert of boring books till I get to the next great V.C. Andrews (hopefully......!).<BR>I suggest all the early books-now those were the greats!<BR>I Also suggest House in Thornton Wood by Anne Knoll for older readers it's about a young woman who discovers the mysteries of the past.	2003-10-29

A neat little book about Soulmates and the ultimate love, the Twin Flame. I admit I leafed through the first chapter or so about the love between two movie stars which I found kind of boring. The rest of the book though was quite interesting. You learn about how twin flames come into being, about soulmates and about karmic marriages. This book also has a neat section on the violet flame visualization. The violet flame is supposed to help raise spirtual vibration and dissolves karma. This book introduced me to this interesting exercise of the violet flame and I plan to learn more about it. I also suggest reading her book on Reincarnation which is just as fascinating.	2003-10-21

Can things end happily for Theodore or is more struggles ahead for him in the new land of America?<br />This saga involve's Ned Wakefield's side of the family and is just as good as the first saga. This saga has it all-courage,daring and a rollercoaster ride of emotions. Alot of things don't end Happily Ever After and this book in my opionion is more mature and an intense read then the Sweet Valley Series where everything often has sunny, cheery endings. Given that I read this book about 8(?) years ago and still remember it after reading thousands of books since then says alot.<BR>I also suggest for older readers the Fearless series which is also created by Francine Pascal	2003-10-21

It's a sweeping saga of love, heartbreak and courage. Even after 7 or so years ago when I bought it I still remember it fondly. This book involves the women on Alice Robertson's side of the family. It shows these beautiful women's courage and strength as it follows them from a boat heading for America where Alice meets the true love of her heart, Theodore Wakefield, to Sweet Valley California. Along the way you experience the heroic spirit of each of the women and their loves and losses. This is no drippy love novel but a novel that is filled with both bright and dark moments as each character faces challenges and love lost and found. <BR>If you like this novel I suggest for Adult readers To Deep for Tears and for the younger reader The Wakefield Legacy: The Untold Story.	2003-10-20

There's constant action and terrifying dark magic and a killer curse to keep one glued to the pages. I also highly suggest Christopher Pike as well, like R.L.

In some books the hero comes across to me like a manequin-very handsome on the surface but without any depth or any chemistry appeal.<BR>The sparks flying off Talon and warm hearted Sunshine,the heroine, were very heated and the idea of the soulmate thing I thought was neat.I also liked the idea of sexy muscley vampire slayers roaming the night wearing ray bans and protecting the innocent as they zoom around in flashy foreign cars (In Kyrian's case) or on motorcycles (As Ash does).<BR>Plus, I like that Ms. Kenyon made her hero blond. There's enough dark haired heroes in romance to sink a ship. And there's just something sinfully delicious about a dark eyed man with golden hair, especially in the way that Ms. Kenyon creates them.<BR>I also suggest Karen Marie Moning as an author to read. Her heroes also have brawn with brains and a special kind of chemistry with their mates that make for a fun read.	2003-07-17

When I saw Dr. Mummford's book mentioned in her book I eagerly snatched up the book and card kit. Ashamed to admit it, but I'm not one to have an attention span for longer then 5 seconds but the cards did help my lucid dreaming and probably would have had more profound results if I had stuck witht the exercises. Right now I'm returning to the tattawa's because of my need to get in touch with the element of earth after badly hurting my knee. the exercises are interesting enough that I'm eager to return to them.

They steal, lie ,drink and sleep around and act totally messed up which is a nice change of pace but I felt like it was the same paper dolls just dressed in biker chick wear this time. The characters don't seem very fleshed out to me and it's merely their anti social actions that seperate them from Melody or Laura in my mind. And the thing about them going to some 'special' jail. Gimme a break! Hopefully it's not going to be like the Orphan's or Falling Stars with some evil person running the place. Imo, it would be interesting to see them try to fend for themselves in a real jail.

I loved Willow, Into the Woods and on the opposite side, loathed Twisted Roots (The Title: What is this a shampoo ad?). HL falls somewhere in the middle. It was interesting to see things from Claude's point of view but the book felt glossed over. We never really got to see Grace open up about the horrors she experienced and let sunshine into those wounds by way of Claude's love. Instead it was more like-I love her, she loves me, now let's go have some fun rolling in the grass behind the Willow's. Another thing that was maddening was how they made her into the Pollayana of the Mental Institution. Cheering all the other patients up and acting completely sane, how boring and so much like all the other V.C Princesses who go around making everyone instantly happy just by their presence. And then when Claude was struggling to find what to do about the pregnancy that really ticked me off. If he loved Grace so much he could have found a way to be with her without risking his reputation. All he had to do was have her released and then like a year from then join her and their baby. She wouldn't be a patient anymore so he was free to be with her. Instead he has his fling then meekly returns to his snooty wife he doesn't even love except as a prized trophy to show off to his friends. Divorcing his wife would have caused them all a whole lot less loads of pain. <BR>The next book Broken Wings looks.... interesting.

I ended up skipping the Sam and Tom parts because I really didn't think they were that interesting and instead read the Heather, Ed, and Gaia parts (my three favorite characters. T. is added to that list when she appears in later books). So there I was reading an exciting Gaia part then BAM! it would be sniveling Sam being bullied by Mr. Psycho Josh and torturing himself again and again and again that he can't tell Gaia that he's a pawn used by Loki and his gang. Yawn. Still, the 100 or so pages I did read were great with Ed getting closer to mustering his courage and telling Gaia his true feelings.

Things are definetly getting more exciting in Gaia's world. #24 is a shining star of a book, and high above #13,14,ect (which I liked but did not love).

She went from self-centered prima donna to mother teresa type character who's found some amount of peace. That's the one word I would use to describe this book-peace. Each of the characters finds an amount of peace in this book. The struggles are over (for now).

I am so glad I picked up this CD. After the relaxing effects of her Becoming the Goddess CD and her Intuition one it didn't take much to convince myself to snatch up this CD. This is a great CD and already after 3 days of listening to it I'm feeling the effects of it. My thinking is much clearer, not so clouded with worry as it was. I try natural alternatives as often as I can rather then loading my body with pills to deal with my constant state of stress overload and these CD's...their like sunshine for the mind, helping to keep me healthy. <BR>I also suggest Becoming the Goddess and Hypnosis for Intuition.

Andrews it was refreshing to have a heroine who was sharp, if not cruel and cynical.<BR>That's all the praise you'll be able to pry from me for this book. Though the change of character was something new I still couldn't like this book and I especially found it hard to sympathize with a character that will later on do so many horrible things. I suppose this book was supposed to show us how Oliva Logan became so cold and evil, what with getting her heart broken by what's his face but I think that no matter what had happened, what environment she had grown up in she would have grown up the same. With snake venom in her veins rather then blood what else could we expect? I was so sick of her spitting negativity left and right that I was glad when the book ended. Later thankfully, V.C. Andrews ceates a heroine that is both smart and kind, Willow	2003-03-08

Then Gisselle bursts onto her tranquil existence bringing with her a hurricane of trouble and a blue eyed man she once knew and has always loved...<BR>A silent world of eternal sleep will claim one of the characters and a love awakened will claim others, ripping worlds apart and causing one character to take a long, deep sip of bayou water.	2003-03-02

Good thing I picked it up at a dollar store. The story started out alright but I think it was when Barf stumbled tipsily onto the scene that things went down hill. The last scene were they were in the woods was.....about as romantic as watching a dead tree rot. <BR> The L.J. Smith type cover design attracted me to it despite the giggle worthy red eyes of Garth, our \\"hero\\" (snort) and the way Miranda's sprawled across it like one of those cheesy 80's romance covers. And if I remember right (this book is in a deep dark place in my closet and will hopefully never be unleashed on the world again)Garth even has a mullet..and then there's the demonic blood shot red eyes staring out from the cover.)   <BR>My suggestion, L.J.

I have read three of the books from this series and while they have not blown me away they are fun reads. The books are about 4 girls living in L.A. who find out that they are more then ordinary girls, that they are in fact quite special-they are daughters of the moon. These books though are more then just about 4 girls with magic powers fighting the evil atrox. They are about finding the goddess within oneself, the part that is courageous, and the part that is willingly to fight for something that one believes passionately in. To me the message is that every girl is a goddess in disguise. Like it says in this book, they don't look like goddesses (Serena has a nose ring for example and dresses like one character puts it \\"like a christmas tree\\". They can feel embarassed (Vanessa's feelings about dissapearing around Michael) and the mean,popular girl at school (who insecure inside) gets enjoyment by criticizing their clothing. She gets her just desserts though, just read the part involving the school pep rally and laught out loud! This is a great book and filled with funny parts like when Catty falls into a cafe after one of her time travels and how Serena's mind reading sends a nice guy she liked running in the opposite direction!!<BR>She does meet someone else but this person is a mystery to her because all their thoughts are in arabic. This being unable to read their thoughts might put her in danger though (hint: he has a sun tattoo around his belly button while Serena is the daughter of the moon) and send her into the cold fire.	2003-02-28

I'm past the teenage years now but still I find myself turning to a Sweet Valley book when in need of a comfort read. I still own half of my old Sweet Valley Twin books and I regret giving the other half away.These books are often unrealistic but they are also fun. This book is a little darker in tone but come on, these books are like a disney movie you know everything is going to turn out alright at the end. But then, in these times I'm glad to have a book that will be guaranteed to put a smile on my face and I'm not ashamed to admit it. They should give kids these kind of books to read in classrooms rather then those depressing ones. Sorry about the rant and I'll just make a quick review about this book. In it Gia comes to SVU to find an ex who dissed her. She has made herself over and has some magic tricks up her sleeve,she is ready to do anything to snare Parker and put him under her spell.<BR>Anything, even if it means putting Jessica out of the way-permantly.

The story is about Maggie who is trying to find her supposedly dead brother and who, because of her dangerous quest, is dragged into a land unchanged by time, a place of castles, and witches, and gorgeous vampire princes with hearts of ice. The chemistry between Maggie and Delos is great and Maggie, like Poppy, is not drop dead gorgeous as a human. She's just an ordinary girl with a big heart and extrodinary courage which Delos see's in her eyes and it attracts him to her. She is the warmth that is missing in his cold existence and the scenes where they are together just make me want to go \\"awww\\" because of how tender he is towards her. <BR>Maggie seems, I don't know, I quess less archetypal to me then some characters and like a real girl. Like the kind who would at school get voted most popular simply because she's so nice to everyone.<BR>An L.J. Smith book that in my opinion is not to be missed!	2003-02-27

When I heard about it I immediately headed to the bookstore to buy it. To my dissapointment they did not have it in. It took a couple of more try's but I finnally had it in my hand and was anticipating sitting down and reading what looked like an exciting vampire/romance novel.<BR>I sat down, I read halfway through, then I put it down and never picked it up again. It started out interesting but went down hill once Aidan a dominant caparthian male, became the dominant character in the story. His personality was to overpowering and the heroine just seemed to fade into the background. When he started acting like the heroine couldn't move an inch without him there to protect her that's when I realized this was going to be one of those boring novels where the woman is protected like a piece of china . It looked like a good book but Aidan cast to much a shadow over the heroine's personality so she became just a meek shadow of what she might have been.<BR>If you like a little horror in your vampire romance you might want to check out Laurell K.

It is well written (waaay superior to books like #20 for example) and it does not go around in circles like some previous books and instead zooms forward like Ed riding his skateboard but it's heading toward a big brick wall. That brick wall is poor, poor ex-prisoner Sam. Poor Sam! All day he dreams of Gaia to keep him sane in his cold little prison. Then one day he escapes. Why Oh Why did he have to escape?! What with all Sam went through at the hands of Gaia's Evil Uncle Loki Gaia's got to be feeling pretty guilty. Esspecially since she and Ed were getting all lovey dovey and smoochy while Sam was rotting away not knowing if he was ever going to be saved, probably thinking he was going to be in there till he was an old man with rotted teeth and white hair.<BR>If I could reach in the book and grab Gaia. I would shake and shake her and scream: You do not have to get back with Sam! Guilt should not chain you to this [person] who was so stupid he kept breaking up with Heather and getting back together with Heather, breaking up with Heather and getting back together with Heather and then, and then sleeping with your evil adopted mom!<BR>Oh and dumping you on your doorstep when you were knocked out cold and totally defenseless because he was to afraid to face Ella!! I am crossing my fingers and toes and praying that the next book does not take a turn in that direction.	2003-02-23

Madness, skeletons in the family closet, and an innocent girl pulled undertow by her families secrets. Where have I read this before? Um, Let me see...Dawn, Ruby, Heaven, FITA, Melody. Two hundred or so pages is not long enough to really get to know the character and only allows enough pages for the bare bones of the plot to be laid down. And that plot had already been done in um, let me see...Dawn, Ruby, Heaven, FITA, Melody. Still, I made my way through Cinnamon, then Ice, and now Honey. By the time I got to Honey I was pretty much ready to give up. I thought it couldn't be more boring then Cinnamon. I was wrong! There's Honey living on a farm, playing her (fiddle? cellio? I can't remember!) and living with a (bible spouting Grandpa? Again can't remember!) All I remember clearly is the level of dissapointment I felt. And yeah there probably was some bible spouting relative thrown in the mix (think FITA, Melody, Dawn, and Darkest Hour)and you don't have to be a psychic to figure that out!<BR>If you find Honey tastes more like garbage don't give up hope! V.C. Andrews does redeem IMO with Willow ( a full length novel Halleleuigh!!)And adult readers might want to check out The House in Thorton Wood by Anne Knoll. It's a gothic novel I just read about a young girl (first person like V.C. Andrews) who goes to live on a manor as a nanny and finds love and discovers the secrets of her past.	2003-02-22

I mean actually talking not just staring at eachother like moony eyed stuffed animals. If you want an interesting novel try L.J. Smith's Forbidden Game triliogy or Cate Tieran's Sweep series.	2003-02-22

True balance-I had lost my balance literally a year back and every since then have been plagued by leg problems.<BR>This book helped me realize I had been missing the warning signs of an unbalanced first chakra. I could probably have prevented my injury if I hadn't been so mule headed and had had this book earlier. Sonia's tips and suggestions on how to get in touch with my first chakra are easy things to do, there's nothing so hard that I can't incorporate it into every day living. The check list on each chakra really can help tell where one stands on each chakra. Thanks to her book I've spotted a problem with my throat chakra (the chakra center that deals with speaking and communication) before it became a big problem like my root chakra (heck, I quess I'm learning!). This is a neat book with tons of ways to balance each chakra and her Psychic Pathway book is just as good.	2003-02-22

I've read the Sweep series, which is wonderful, I've read Circle of Three which is...alright but no series has ever measured up to these three books. In this one Cassie starts to really find the power within. I don't just mean her witch powers but also a core within herself that makes her strong. The final showdown between her and her father is great. I was cheering for her all the way. This book has it all-strong heroine, dashing hero(es) (come on, we can't forget Nick!)and wonderful secondary characters. ...	2003-02-22

Jenny and friends are caught in a nightmare world inside a paper house. Can Jenny escape or will she succumb to gorgeous Julian and become his shadow queen? <BR>When I first picked this book up I had no idea what I was getting into (just like Jenny and her friends when they were building the paper house!) This is a great book with two great leads (when I say that I mean Jenny and Julian) they are so great together and why the heck Tom was even in this book except to be a whining, annoying distraction? Maybe because it makes look Julian even more like the perfect guy!!! If I had been in the story it would have been only about 20 pages long cause I would have looked into Julian's mesmerizing blue eyes and been like, please, please, please make me your shadow queen! Jenny must be made out of ice resisting him for so long before she finnally... It makes for a great great read though!	2003-02-22
US	37913445	R1RFKL7QJ2HKLC	1564145581	470313317	The Power of Your Other Hand, Revised Edition	Books	4	61	62	N	N	Simply put, a good book	I picked up this book while going through a phase. I was trying to tap into my more artistic side which had been easy for me up until about three years ago, with real world concerns pressing in and working at a job that didn't spark my creativity I found it harder and harder to distinguish what I really wanted to do compared to what I thought I should do. This book I was hoping would help-and it did. It has many, many exercises to help you get more in touch with your more spontaneous, child like side. Many of these exercises were  uncomfortable for me at first for me because they involved giving up the control I held so rigidly to.In fact I found it very hard because giving up control would mean I would have to trust in myself. I didn't know how to flow anymore and this book is all about flow. Some of the exercises involve drawing pictures with your non-dominant hand and others involve getting in touch with different parts of yourself you might have left behind for some reason or another. I find Lucia Cappachione an author who's style is very warm and the personal stories she tells in the book set her apart from self help guru's who just preach and preach and give nothing of themselve's in turn. This book is never boring and is like a kid's activity book for adults.	2003-02-22

The book soon became to boring for me though and I started skimming about half way through the book. When the author wrote something about the hero getting , um, lusty about another woman in some spa or such that's when I realized this book was not for me. The perfect hero may get lusty about another woman but I do not care to read about it and this hero was to boring and arrogant to be my perfect hero. <br />For the personification of the perfect hero, in my opionion, Karen Marie Moning could not make them better.	2003-02-22

I too think Hannah is a big baby for getting so bent out of shape about a baby. The change in Willow is most shocking. I thought she was stronger then that! She acted like a complete wimp. Granted she suffered a great loss but you think she would have learned something about coping in all those psychology classes she had taken. Sure Ruby suffered after the loss of her ***(might be considered a spoiler so I won't put it) and sure she retreated to fantasy land but she would have been proud of how her daughter (Pearl) had reacted. Hannah on the other hand is nothing to be proud of. By the end of the book I was skimming because Hannah was just too irritating.	2003-02-22

If you like a book where you find yourself smiling about it even hours after finishing it these are the books for you.

I was at wits end looking for an author to replace L.J. Smith who's last book was written when the dinasours still ruled the planet and man lived in caves (since she's my favorite author it has seemed that long)! When I stumbled across The Circle of Three. The Circle of Three series is by no means boring and In the Dreaming was quite interesting but so far in the last few months I've only bought 3 from the series because I feel no urgency to get the whole series (you know where you practically fall in love with a new series and have to get them all right away? Don't have that magic feeling.) Isobel Bird's Circle of Three Series does not take flight but it will keep you up late turning the pages until you've finished this light, fun read. <br />Suggestions on books like those of L.J. Smith and Isobel Bird that you might want to check out:<BR>Companions of the Night-Vivian Vande Velde,The Silver Kiss and Blood and Chocolate-Annette Kurtis Clause, The Dark Angel by Meredith Ann Pierce, Any book by Christopher Pike,The Fingerprints Series by Melinda Metz	2003-02-20
