The problem is that this book doesn't do it. The authors do not fully explain the examples. For example, on page 45 they display a dialog box, but never tell you how to get to it. The examples don't work; on another page we are told that if you double click on a combo box that certain code will be generated. JDev doesn't generate the code. The book is also based on a beta release of JDev!!! I am not sure why anyone would base a book on beta software.  <br /> <br />After struggling with the book for hours I gave up. This was really a disappointment for me.  <br />	2004-09-10

It provides an excellent analysis of the situation. In the `90's the irrational exuberance of the economic potential of the Internet created the dot-com bubble. There is also an inflated perception on what the Internet means socially, a condition that still exists. This book is a pin that pops that bubble. <br />One warning, this book is not a page-turner. At times the way in which the authors deliver the information is somewhat dry. This made the book difficult to read at times. This is not to suggest a fault, you just need to be prepared for what you are about to read. <br />If you are looking for a fun filled read, this is not the book for you. If you are looking for a book that delivers factual information and insights on the implications of the Internet on closed regimes, then this should definitely be part of your library.	2003-04-04

There are other books that are like eating chocolates. You enjoy every bite, but you know with every bite you are getting closer to the end and when you get to the end it's the end. That is how I felt about this book. It turned into a real page-turner for me because I kept getting drawn into the book. With every page I knew I was getting to the end.<br />I started reading this book because I wanted to learn more of the cognitive sciences. I did learn a great deal. There were, however, many other lessons that I picked up along the way. The most important is that our children are not lumps of clay waiting to be made into something. Our children are our children and we need to focus more on the experience of parenting them. When I finished this book I spent the evening at the movies with my son. I think this is the most important lesson I have learned from the book. <br />As a Christian, I found this book challenged my faith. I do not mean that as a bad thing in any way. The book raised important questions that we as Christians need to ask ourselves. I am not sure if I have any answers to the questions this book raises, but I am glad that it has forced me to think more deeply about my beliefs. <br />Also, I enjoy a book that pulls in things from many different disciplines. You have to love a book that quotes Hobbes, Vonnnegut, and Orwell. This book is well worth whatever investment you might make in the time and money to read it. I would strongly recommend this book.	2003-03-16

My nine year old read this book and I read everything my children read. I was taken by surprise. This is so much more than a book for children, although children can certainly appreciate the lessons that it has to teach. <br />There is so much here. It is truly a rich and rewarding reading experience. To me, it demonstrated how we all need to unleash overselves from the dull and mundane. We need to look beyond what is apparent to the eyes and see the magic that is in something as simple as a glade or a few trees across a brook. I also like the references to Narnia.<br />This book has won many awards and they are well deserved. I wish I could congratulate Katherine Paterson personally for such a magnificent contribution to literature. You really owe it to yourself to read this book.	2003-02-27

I am sure that Jan Herring's intent was to deliver something of real value. Sadly, this book falls short of the mark. In short the information in the book is out of date and poorly presented.<br />The book was published several years ago and it shows. Much of the information is so old that developments since the book was published make many of the author's points moot.<br />In addition, the material is poorly presented. There are pages that look like they were taken directly from a presentation and stuck into the book. Often these slides while taking up space in the book do not add much value. Much of the information is simply a rehash of other papers that the author has read. Even with all this fluff the book is only 66 pages.<br />This book is certainly not worth its costs. Save your money and look for a more recent work.	2003-01-08

What the heck do I know about barbecue? Before I read this book, nothing. Then my family bought me a real barbecue, the kind you use when you cook with real wood. Some friends recommended this book to me and I started using some of the recipes. Well, now when my neighbors smell the smoke they line up by the front door ready to eat. <br />I work in an industry where I travel quite a bit. When I am in the south I am able to get some good barbecue, and the recipes in this book have that same genuine southern flavor. I also have friends from all over the country come and visit. Even folks from the south, where they know what real barbecue tastes like, enjoy my cooking. <BR>The Apple-City ribs recipe in here you would not believe. It is soo good that when you taste it your lips are going to jump off your face, turn around and kiss you for eating something THAT good.

I thought the discussion on the duel between Hamilton and Burr was excellent. The book delved into the events that actually led to the duel. The book also had an interesting discussion on the slavery issue. <br />Some of  the things that were discussed I really liked. I have never been all that enthused with Franklin, I think he is rather over rated. In this book, the author seems somewhat cool towards him as well. He raised some interesting points on Franklin that kind of point to his having feet of clay. <br />For all that I have read to date on the American Revolution, I still don't get this hero worship of Washington either. He just doesn't seem all that great to me and this book only seems to confirm this feeling. It may just be me, but from what this book says, I still don't know why this man is so glorified. <br />The book spends a lot of time talking about the entire Adams and Jefferson thing. Well, that subject has been done to death. I can do without reading a heck of a lot more on that one. If you're interested in that subject you should definitely read this book. <br />All in all, I would recommend reading this book, but I wouldn't tell you that you have to rush out and get it. I certainly don't feel that it was worth a Pulitzer. Then again I don't know what the competition was like.	2001-12-23

There are several important features to this text that make it well worth using. First, it is well written. The discussion of the scripture verse is at times insightful and instructional. The thoughts are very easy to read, yet substantive. Second, additional verses are provided. As you work your way through the year, you could make this part of your daily study time. After reading what is written in the devotional itself, you can then go on to search the scripture further. This makes the devotional not a substitute for reading the scripture, but a compliment to it. No matter how good a devotional may or may not be, it should never replace the reading of the Word. This adds to that reading. <br />Finally, there are suggestions for prayer. The suggestions assist the reader in meditating on what that days reading may have meant in his or her specific life and how it might be applied. The link between reading the word and prayer is perhaps the most important. We need to have a dialog with the Lord and this text encourages the reader in establishing this dialog.<br />In short, I really liked using this devotional and I would encourage you to do so as well.	2001-12-23

It combined all my favorite things into one. I love history. I work with information systems and I am excited about the future. This book combines all of them. <br />This book examines how information systems have affected our society throughout history as well exploring the possibilities of what the future might hold. Have you ever considered how information systems have affected our history? Have you ever thought about how it is going to affect our future? Mr. Cortada?s insightful book provides great food for thought. There is just so much stuff here that is really fascinating. <br />Any student of history will certainly enjoy this book. Any one professionally involved with information systems should read this book. It made me appreciate the value of the commodity in which we trade, information. <br />The back of the book says that the author has written over two dozen books on these subjects. I really think I need to go out and get some of them. It also says that he is a lecturer. I look forward to the day when I can hear him speak. <br />Well done!!	2001-12-15

It is not a down and dirty technical book that describes the inner workings of an e-procurement system.  Then again, I think that is why I like it so much. After reading this book I feel I know the business behind e-procurement and that is THE most important issue when it comes to any system. <br />As a result of reading this book I have a better understanding of what e-procurement is all about. I also feel I have gained an appreciation for the different types of systems as well as where the entire e-procurement market is headed. He discussed the importance of things such as Decision Support and Business Intelligence. He supported most, if not all, of his points with solid research. <br />I am an systems engineer and not a business person. I got a lot out of this book. I would recommend it to both members technical groups as well as business people. The technical person will gain an appreciation for the business aspects of e-procurement. While the manager/business person will be given good direction and insights into e-procurement. I would imagine this to be of benefit to anyone whose organization is contemplating e-procurement or just some one generally interested in the area. This is even a good read for the manager who is not currently involved with e-procurement. It may show you how much you DO need it. <br />KUDOS to Dale Neef.	2001-12-12

While &quot;The Prayer of Jabez&quot; did give me insights into prayer, it did not center enough on Christ. This work corrects that error. He starts right away talking about the Lord and our relationship with him. I think that it is extraordinarily important to any study of Christianity. I would recommend that you read this book prior to &quot;The Prayer of Jabez.&quot; If you already have read the other, you should read this one soon. <br />The second thing that I liked about this book is the characterization of discipline. He portrays God and our relationship with him so well. He describes a God that is not out there to SLAM us for the least little error, but a loving Father that is interested in growth. How true! <br />The third thing I enjoyed about this book is that it drew a distinction between pruning and discipline. I agree that there are times where the Lord is trying to correct a behavior in which we are participating and in the other he is trying to lead us on to more fruitful behavior. <br />The fourth thing I enjoyed about this book is the definition of fruit. I read this at a good time in my life. So often we think of fruit as simply leading people to the Lord. In this book he describes fruit as doing things that glorify God. So, we can see things like being a good father and husband, a good employee, and a good neighbor as all things we do to glorify God. This really helped me prioritize some of the things in my own life. <br />I can go on and on about this book, but I won't. You should just read it. What I enjoy most about this entire series of books is that they are brief and to the point. They teach a specific lesson and move on. I see them as having a larger scope than an individual sermon, but not so large that there needs to be volumes and volumes written. I hope to see more books in this series.	2001-11-21

I heard it once said of baseball that it is three minutes of action packed into four hours. This book is seven simple thoughts packed into 94 insipid pages. The \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" bookmark I was given with the book delivered the same concepts as the book. The bookmark, however, presented the concepts more succinctly and just as well.<br />The problem is not the idea of embracing change. The idea that we should expect, anticipate, and embrace change is valuable. The problem is in the way the author chose to present it. While the story of the mice was cute, it would have been tolerable if it was presented as part of a text that dealt with the benefits of change and an analysis on why people are resistant to change. Instead, the story of the mice is couched in a story of some people at a class reunion. The people at the reunion superficially discuss the application of the ideas in the mouse story. Early in the book an individual disagrees with the \\"group think\\" and is ridiculed in the book, a handy way for the author to deal with dissent. <br />How much better this book could have been if a more disciplined discussion of change was included. This book is such an oversimplification of the issue change that it is virtually worthless. Again, save your time and money; buy the bookmark. It is just as helpful as the book.	2001-11-08

I very much enjoyed reading of the relationship between he and his wife, Abigail. This tells a good deal of her story as well as the hardships she had endured to support her husband. I could not imagine the separation both of them experienced. As a result of reading this I came to have a greater appreciation of them both. <br />Also, I came to see John Adams as a kindred spirit. His love of books and literature were something to which I related. He also considered himself both a Christian and a Free Thinker. A combination while important is still very rare. It is a description that someday I hope others would make of me. <br />The only place I think the book falls short is that it is a very personal biography and that it does not pay enough attention to the historical events that are going on around him. For example, the discussion of the Boston Massacre was not nearly detailed enough. I would have preferred to have seen much more on this topic. Also, while the relationship between Adams and Jefferson was discussed throughout the work not enough of a discussion was paid to the differences in their beliefs. This was something I was hoping to get out of the book when I first started reading it. <br />All in all, however, I would say that this book is well worth reading. While it does not provide some of the insights that I had hopped to gather from this book, it does provide many others. The chief insight is the personal costs paid by many for the founding of this great nation.	2001-10-22

There weren't many things to laugh about, then I read this book. The first half of the book had me laughing so hard my side hurt. I sat in Logan airport laughing uncontrollably. People must have thought I lost my mind. <br />This is Garrison Keillor at his Finest. I loved it. Don't think this is lighthearted fluff either. The book reminded me of what it is like to be a boy in small town America. There was a real story of substance here. One of the things I enjoy so much about Garrison Keillor's work is that he is able to tell a story with an extremely important message while making you laugh. This book touched my heart. As I read the final paragraph there was more than one tear in my eye. <br />Well done Mr. Keillor.	2001-10-02

I initially picked up this book to learn. I didn't think that it would be a &quot;fun&quot; read, but I thought the concepts I would learn would be of real value. As it turns out it was a very good read. This is an enjoyable work that conveyed some great information on some very interesting topic. This is a very very readable and enjoyable book. In addition, this book is tremendously helpful in that it points the way to the next set of books to read. This book first gives you a taste for these topics and then it points to where we could learn more. As each school of thought is discussed some of the chief works for those schools are discussed. It has launched me on a totally new area of study and research.<br />Prior to reading this book I had no appreciation for any of the different schools of philosophy. For example, I know that many of the founding fathers of our nation based their thoughts on men like Hume. However, I did not know the specifics of the relationship. This book clarified that as well as many other points of interest. It has also helped substantiate many of my Christian beliefs. There are things in Christianity, communion for example, which I did not understand. After reading this book and getting a taste for some philosophical schools of thought, I now have a deeper understanding of some of our basic Christian principles. <br />If you are at all interested in philosophy and are a novice to the field, READ THIS BOOK.	2001-09-17

I am very interested in the history of Christianity as well as its affect on Western civilization. This book was an excellent starting point. From the adoption of Christianity by the Roman Empire through the middle ages, this book gave a great review of how Europe developed. Since the church was so instrumental in this development, it is discussed in great detail of course.<br />I am not sure which parts of the book I liked best. The first few chapters were excellent, but I literally could not put the book down for the last two chapters. I really mean this. I was on a plane when my glasses broke. I was so into the book that I struggled to read the last 50 pages without my glasses, at times holding the book at arms length and squinting really really hard. <br />If you enjoy history, I would most heartily recommend this book.	2001-08-23

The book picks up where the first leaves off and of course to appreciate this book complete you will want to first read &quot;I,Claudius.&quot; Reading &quot;I, Claudius&quot; and &quot;Cladius, The God&quot; gave me a thirst to learn more of Roman history.

It kind of snuck up on me, but now I realize I really did like this book. When I first finished reading it I did not like it at all, this was a couple of days ago. Once I started to really analyze the story, however, I realized how well it truly works.  <br />There are parts that I would have chosen to emphasize and develop more than the author had. For example, the Gollum, there was so much potential there and nothing was really done with it. It also was just depressing at times. I just did not like at all what happened with the brother (I am trying not to give too much away in this review). <br />About half way through the book it started to wander. I felt that it really started to drone on and on. I couldn't help but wonder where the heck the author was taking me. If, however, you suffer through that part you actually get to a pretty good conclusion. Just remember it may take a bit of time and thought to appreciate the story. Overall I would think the book is worth a read. In fact, of all the Pulitzer winners I have read this ranks up there as one of the better ones. The prize was well earned by this author.	2001-08-20

Also there are times where he could really demonstrate the importance of some fundamental Christian principles, but misses those as well. <br />First, he doesn't even mention Jesus until a third of the way into the book and then it is just to quote him. Jesus is the center of our faith. Without his death and resurrection we could not approach a holy and perfect God. In addition, the promises of God are for his children, not just anyone. Although anyone can become a child of God, we must do so through Jesus Christ. I am sure that the author understands this, but those not familiar with the Christian Scripture could assume from this book that anyone who would pray this prayer would receive the promises of God. We can't &quot;con&quot; God with some simple little ditty. We must submit ourselves to his will for our lives.<br />A second major omission is the lack of emphasis on the end of the prayer. Here it says &quot;And that you would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain.&quot; Isn't that a major point in our Christian belief? Don't we shun evil because we don't want to cause pain, pain to ourselves, pain to the ones we love? More importantly, if we truly love God we strive to please him, to cause him the opposite of pain which is the joy of having children who love him. There are hours worth of discussion on this point alone. <br />A third issue is the name Jabez, it means born in pain. As Christians we were born in pain, the pain Jesus suffered on the cross so that we might receive salvation. How nicely this could have tied the salvation message in with the message that God seeks to bless those who love him. The idea was just not developed. <br />As a Christian, I understand what the author is trying to say, but he inept in his explanations. I would sum it up differently. First, the children of God were born in pain, the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Second, if we genuinely seek to fulfill his will for our lives he will bless us in that endeavor. Third, the purpose of this blessing exceeds earthly riches, but the extension of God's love and blessings to all with whom we come in contact. <br />In short, I would have preferred to have heard more of discussion of how this relates to our relationship with God through Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. Although the author expressed his views poorly, from reading the book his heart seems to be in the right place.	2001-08-15

I wasn't sure of the message that it was sending. Nat Turner's &quot;owner&quot; by the account treated him well. Yet, Nat Turner killed him. Why? Is the very act of owning a slave justification for the killing of the owner? Was Nat Turner just a madman as the book seems to imply? Or, was he so mistreated that he was a product of his times? <br />This is a very thought-provoking book. Regardless of what may think of the main character or even that terrible period of our history in which people were enslaved, you should read this book. It gives a different perspective of that time. It is excellent fodder for discussion of not only Nat Turner and what happened in that particular revolt, but the entire institution of slavery. I am not sure I really understand this issue and its long term implications on our society. This book, however, helped me understand that I don't understand.	2001-08-14

I first read this book when I was in high school. I so loved the work that I went on to read the rest of the books written by Vonnegut. Since then, I have become a voracious reader. It is all because of this book. It was perhaps the first book that taught me the joy of reading. Looking back on it now, I think of how it warned me of chasing my own sirens in life. If only then I had understood the book as I do now! Perhaps I could have avoided a wrong turn or two. <br />In any event, this is really one of those books that everyone needs to read at least once.	2001-08-13

The Hobbit and the subsequent Lord of the Ring Series really launched an entire generation of Fantasy readers. I loved this book as well as the books that followed. While this is more light hearted than the ones that follow, it certainly is just as great as the others.	2001-08-13

What a book it is!! I strongly recommend it on two levels. First Mr. Bellow is a master of the language. His descriptions are so unique. I am afraid to mention them here because I don't want to spoil them for you. I will share one of my many favorite lines from the book. At one point, he describes an old man as having &quot;a head like a blown dandelion.&quot; How on earth did he come up with such a terrific description. This book is filled with lines like that. <br />The book also has a great story. It in fact reminds me of another favorite book &quot;Confederacy of Dunces.&quot; This is, in a sense, a more serious look at the same type of character as the main character in &quot;Confederacy of Dunces.&quot; Humbolt himself is a provocative character, but then there is the reaction to him by the people around him. It is well worth the read.	2001-08-13

Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings)	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	This is THE book	When it comes to Fanatsy it doesn't get any better than this. Tolkien weaves a tale of such marvelous depth and richness that it is a classic. If envy you if you have not read this book. You get to read it for the first time. I'll never experience that joy again.<br />You have got to read this book even if you have a passing interest in fantasy.	2001-08-13

I first read this book six years ago and it has changed my career. It provides a clear and concise description of a data warehouse as well as the necessity of creating one. <br />A well-read copy of this book should be on the shelf of every one involved in the construction of a data warehouse or business intelligence system. It is a classic that needs to be read.	2001-08-10

I found the story interesting and I related to the main character. There were points where I found myself thinking &quot;I understand how he feels here.&quot; At other times I thought &quot;Wow, I never looked at it that way before&quot; and I felt much better about how I felt about my self as well as things that have happened around me. I would certainly put this on my list of books that are worth reading. I really enjoyed it.	2001-08-10

I have now read every book in the series. This book is well worth the acclaim it has received. I know that many Christians have heard terrible things about this book, but they are untrue. I found this book to he a touching story about a little boy to whom I greatly relate. I understand that there is magic and wizardry in the book, but I personally found it no more objectionable than what I found in Tolkein or C.S. Lewis. Although the book does not have the Christian symbolism of &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; or &quot;Chronicles of Narnia,&quot; it still is a great story of a boy who is shunned for being different and overcomes adversity. A good lesson for anyone. If you are a Christian parent, read this book and judge for yourself after having read it.	2001-08-10

After reading this book, I had a much better understanding of the American colonial experience. I also understood to a greater degree the affects that Christianity has had on our culture. In this book, Boorstin compares three colonies. It is interesting to read the cultural differences. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the origins of our nation.	2001-08-09

There are some characters in literature that I find admirable and this book contains several of them. The central characters in this book show great strength and resiliency. The story covers several generations, so it requires a bit of patience on the part of the reader. At one point, I briefly felt that the story was dragging a bit. The ending, however, makes it well worth the read. It is a very thought-provoking book. It certainly deserves the acclaim it has received.	2001-08-09

From the American Industrial revolution to the western expansion, this book opened my eyes to many factors in the building of our nation. In lectures, I often quote Boorstin and his observations.  <br />I also found it amusing when he exploded some common myths concerning our history. You really should read this book.	2001-08-09

Who are truly the artists today? Who are truly the people that are &quot;self-actualizing.&quot; Stegner's work really causes one to stop and think. <br />This book is a delightful discovery for me. This is the first book I have ever read by Mr. Stegner and was immediately drawn into the book. He is masterful in his ability to weave a story. His observations are insightful and his metaphors are thought provoking. This book alone makes him one of the masters of American literature. You NEED to read this book. I personally have it on my list of favorites	2001-08-03

The only problem with this book is that it has the wrong title. It shouldn't be called a &quot;Christian&quot; guide to literature, but simply a guide to literature. I heartily recommend this book to both my Christian and non-Christian friends. <br />Mr. Veith clearly explains the importance of literature in our modern society. His description of the different literary forms gave me a new appreciation for some genres that in the past I had avoided. This book is important to both the avid reader as well as some one who would like to develop an appreciation for literature. It is most appropriate for anyone who has an interest in literature, not just Christians.	2001-08-03

The point of the book is not to provide astounding new star schema design revelations, the very point of the star schema is simplicity, but to provide a method of defining a star  schema that meets the needs of the user. I agree with the Chicago reader  that says that another good book is Kimball's. Both provide valuable  insight. Kimball lays the foundation of the star schema itself, while this  book demonstrates how to use object oriented methods to link that schema to  the needs of the user.	2000-06-06

In my opinion it verges on misrepresentation. The prefix &quot;e-&quot; has a very specific meaning in the industry. The publisher and the author MUST know this. To title the  book &quot;e-Data&quot; more than implies that the  book discusses the  internet. It is only after purchasing the book that I discovered that it is  simply a general data warehousing book with NO appreciable discussion of  the implications the internet has on business intelligence. I have been  working in the data warehousing/business intelligence area for close to ten  years now. I have never heard &quot;e-&quot; applied to anything but  internet realted material. I have no problem with some one coining a new  term in the industry, but it seems to me that this title is a diliberate  attempt to mislead people. I would hope that amazon.com does something to  make clear that this book is improperly titled.	2000-04-26

It is simply one of the best books I have read in a very long time. The style of the book reminds me of Vonnegut when he was in his prime. This work rates up there with  works such as &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; and &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot;.  He has really captured the flavor of New Orleans. If you have ever been  there you can sware that you have been to many of the scenes he so aptly  paints. READ THIS BOOK ! !	2000-04-10

Prior to reading this book I didn't know anything about the Scopes trial other than &quot;Inherit The Wind&quot;. Larson's book, however, was more than informative on the Scopes trial. It  provided insight into many of the related topics. I frequently recommend  this book to friends and family that are interested in finding something  good to read. You really need to read this book. I promise, you WILL love  it.	2000-03-17
