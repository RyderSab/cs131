Koontz takes a turn from his usual, and gives us an unusual twist in the Arctic Circle. I think my question was like the question of some, and I wondered if it would work. Would Dean Koontz try to be Tom Clancy mixed with Oliver North and try to pull of a techno-suspense thriller? No he didn't and I thought WHEW as I finished it up.<br /><br />So we take an assignment to the Arctic, on an iceberg, and let the games begin. But with the climate, storms and what not, trouble brews. As time passes, you wonder if there is somebody there with murder on their mind. You have Harry and Rita Carpenter. Harry is the leader of the expedition, the big dog. Rita has her fears, actually intense phobic reactions. These fears are, #1; Cryophobia: the fear of ice and frost. #2 fear is Frigophobia: the fear of cold. And last but not least is Chionophobia: the fear of snow. Then you have big and bad Pete Johnson, along with Roger Breskin, your basic no fear type guys, Pete is the electric engineer. Then you have Brian Dougherty, related to a former President. I myself couldn't help but laugh at George Lin, who thinks the communists are trying to control them. Claude Jobert, who is also part of the team, and Franz Fischer, who used to date Rita. There you have a believable story, mixed in with the fact that you have a murderer. Oh and by the way, you have bombs in the ice that will blow up the iceberg in about 12 hours. No sweat, right? And HEY!! the Russians are coming to the rescue this time! Don't miss out. I really like the Russian submarine captain, Nikita Gorov, who is in all reality, doing this for his son.<br /><br />I guess the reason I gave this only 4 stars is easy for me. I missed the heart stopping suspense that he normally delivers, and I didn't get much in this. I did get a well written story, one that you can share with anyone without scaring them too much. Koontz really showed a lot of guts in attempting something new, and he pulled it off.<br /><br />So, there was no quote in the beginning from \\"The Book of Counted Sorrows\\" as usual. There was no real blood and guts, as you suspect from Koontz, but he made it work, and did better than most I might add. Now, in his author's note, he added that he previously released this as \\"Prison of Ice\\" by David Axton, and it was rougher and grittier in form. He even said it wasn't his intent to be as technically detailed as Tom Clancy, and I'm glad he wasn't. That would be too overwhelming. But instead, he gives us some frostbite, just a little on the brain to play with our heads here and there. Try it, you just might like it!pting something new, and he pulled it off.  <br /> <br />So, there was no quote in the beginning from \\"The Book of Counted Sorrows\\" as usual.

This is incredible. It is certainly no wonder that this is enjoyed better than \\"Left Behind\\" by some. My wife owns all the LB books, and I got as far as book #3, \\"Nicholae\\", impressed, but not really willing to go further. I couldn't put this down!!<br /><br />So he takes book 2, almost cuts it in half compared to the other 2 books in this trilogy, and just has you squirming on the edge of your seat the whole time! We catch up with Decker and Christopher, and by the end of this, we know who sweet Christopher really is. And although he has very little mention, when he is mentioned, you know a little more about the mysterious Master Djwlij Kajm, and that makes you squirm too. Some of the scenes in this are frightening. Like the locust part. Wow! Hey, it's already in Revelation, and after the way BeauSeigneur described them, I don't want to be around to feel the sting of those suckers!<br /><br />If there is one thing that is convincing, it is the lies of Satan, plain and simple. Just read this, you won't have any doubts. And the way BeauSeigneur writes this is none other than gifted, as well as annointed. Yeah, HE even admits that the trilogy title might be a touchy subject for some people, but I think we can all agree, the point here is to be touched. And to be touched by something greater than we can ever possibly imagine! Book #3 should be amazing, and I'm expecting nothing less!	2005-10-09

It was in mid-March this year, 2005, that my co-workers were going absolutely bonkers over Dean Koontz's first \\"Frankenstein\\" book. After reading it, I was positive there was nothing that could possibly match it. Matter of fact, this old boy was convinced! A few days ago, I picked up Mark Mynheir's debut, \\"Rolling Thunder\\", and \\"Frankenstein\\" got shot down to my 2nd favorite read this year. Not an easy thing to say, but THE ONLY THING TO SAY after finishing this.<br /><br />It isn't always easy to determine whether a first time author has it in him to back up the title, and then make the read as exciting as the back of the book proclaims. In this case, it was all understated. This is for people with real emotions, real hurts, and especially for people who believe in a real God who can heal, even through the most raging storms in life. If the likes of author W. Dale Cramer touched you, give Mark Mynheir a chance, and you won't be able to put this down!<br /><br />We join Agent John Russell who picks up a case. This is a 6 year dilemma of a boy who's been missing from state care. The governor says this comes before anything, and John Russell is the man for the job! In the midst of all this we have baseball season. We also have the biggest storm of John's life. A long buried memory from his past comes back for a visit. It is a storm that John must endure. Will God calm this storm?<br /><br />We learn that John is haunted by thunder storms. He can't stand them. He has an awesome wife, and 2 boys that love him to death. There is even one part of the story that lets us why we need our church family. It's a small tidbit in this, but it had an impact on me. This is God at His best! This is about forgiveness when you don't want to forgive. When it seems like even God doesn't understand what you've been through. It is so powerful! Mark was just instructed to compose the story, and he exceeded my expectations! This is an author to look for in the future!	2005-10-04

When I was a little guy, I loved books by Richard Scarry! Now as a daddy, I'm overjoyed that my little girl, Riley, gets into this book that she got by Scarry.<br /><br />Welcome to Busytown! This book consists of 3 stories that basically have 1 thing in common. They have Huckle Cat, and they all had Lowly Worm as the main attraction in each story. Huckle and Lowly are best buds!<br /><br />The first story, \\"The Best Mistake Ever\\" is simply about how Huckle Cat is sent to the grocery store. There's just one small problem: Huckle forgets the shopping list that Mother Cat wrote out. But Lowly Worm comes to the rescue!! Or does he? While Huckle thinks that his mother wants cream, Lowly's pretty certain that it's ice cream. And when the question of apples comes up, Lowly thinks that apple pie is just what Mother Cat ordered. Will Mother Cat be pleased?<br /><br />Story #2 is \\"A Visit to Mr. Fixit\\". Huckle Cat gets his mother a cuckoo-cuckoo clock for Mother's Day. But with Lowly Worm riding on the back, he takes a corner too fast and crashes into Postman Pig, and breaks the clock. After being ordered to fix the bell on his bicycle by Officer Murphy, he makes a trip to Mr. Fixit to fix both the bell, and a broken cuckoo-cuckoo clock. What will Mr. Fixit do with the broken pieces?<br /><br />Then finally you have \\"Best Friends\\" on Huckle Cat's birthday. But for some reason in school, Lowly Worm is hanging around the other kids, but not Huckle. This is quite unusual, but Huckle gets the surprise of his life!<br /><br />And this is something great for your kids! Richard Scarry is always fun, and it's never a mistake to go with his books. Kids and Richard Scarry go hand in hand!	2005-10-01

After earlier reading \\"The Confessor\\" this year I was hoping for it to be another Gabriel Allon thriller. But it wasn't, yet it had spies, and to say the least, I wasn't disappointed. But there were elements in this making it a little too long, making it clear that this was Silva's first work. That, along with a few other minor things kept this from being the ideal spy novel for myself.<br /><br />We are taken into Abwehr operations! It starts off immediately with a murder, and Silva sets the pace. You have Alfred Vicary, who is Winston Churchill's main man, to basically stop a menace who is virtually unknown, if not unstoppable. In short, Alfred Vicary is depended on by MI5.<br /><br />On the other side, the Germans have Catherine Blake, who is drop dead gorgeous, and if is underestimated, will take you out! She's not one to be trifled with. She even attracts the attention of American hero, Commander Peter Jordan. The question is, when the sparks fly, where will they land?<br /><br />Throughout all this, we are taken into Hitler's war room, along with some other key players. We are tempted at times with the best in wines, and great suspense to go along with it! The ending has the intensity and tenacity of \\"The Hunt For Red October\\" and really gets the heart pumping! This comes at you from all angles. It's probably more than likely that Daniel Silva will be an easy read for me in the future. He's got some great reads out there, and he as me hooked!	2005-09-27

Ok, I've seen the arguments, and the ones for this book are nothing more than futile. This is the worst Grisham novel out there, and I KNOW I'm not the first person to make a statement like that! This sucked! Plain and simple. Need more? Yeah, ok. It lacked. It was like a Bullmastiff dog crapping on the sidewalk, and the owner didn't have a pooper-scooper large enough to scoop it all up. People, let me just say this, John Grisham is that Bullmastiff, and he's crapped all over us.<br /><br />One argument is that, \\"OH, well this is a bestseller!\\" Lemme tell you something, ok. When your name is Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Danielle Steele, Sandra Brown, Tom Clancy, David Morrell, Pat Robertson, WHOMEVER! If you have a name and you are an accomplished author that's had a few bestsellers, the the rest of your work makes it to bestseller status, and that's regardless of whether the book shines or just plain whines! This is a whiner book. And the story line isn't bad, but Grisham doesn't pull it off. And trying to do it with gay ads laced within doesn't quite cut it either. It lacks emotion, and it's nothing less than a cheat. It is also full of dishonesty throughout. That's not the Grisham I enjoyed reading.<br /><br />\\"Runaway Jury\\" was a classic. \\"The Rainmaker\\" was a classic. Not this, not ever.	2005-09-26

Lewis NEVER fails to impress me? I have yet to finish anything by this man that I didn't love! What I've always enjoyed was simply the challenge of what I read by Lewis. Never that easy of a read, but always worthwhile if you take the time, and always an inspiration. When a great novelist like Dean Koontz can quote this man, you KNOW he is at least thought provoking, if not so much more!<br /><br />So, YOU want to know about C.S. Lewis?  When you wanted to know about C.S. Lewis, look no further than \\"Surprised by Joy\\". He loved to read the trilogy of Edith Nesbit, and says that at one point, \\"Seigfried and the Twilight of the Gods\\" book was more important than his doubts about Christianity. Meaning that he cared more about Mythological Norse gods that he didn't believe in, than in a true God he should have believed in. Sounds pretty worldly, but at least he admitted such things. Would many of us today as Christians admit a thing like that? There is nothing more than knee buckling from a man such as Lewis, and it proves he was human, not just the legend we read in awe. This work is partly the HEART of when Lewis was an atheist! I guess anyone who claims to never have sinned has never read the likes of this man, and then experienced the humility. For me it was close to gut wrenching. C.S. Lewis was for real, and he had real problems, and he wrote so many books on so many subjects. That would not only make him a great author, as well as a great Theologian, but also a man of great experience, and that is not to be underestimated!<br /><br />Here is a statement he made about himself without Christ, and about our free will. \\"Without words and (I think) almost without images, a fact about myself was presented to me. I became aware that I was holding something at bay, or shutting something out. Or, if you like, that I was wearing some stiff clothing, like corsets, or even a suit of armor, or if I were a lobster. I felt myself being, there and then, given a free choice. I could open the door or keep it shut; I could unbuckle the armor or keep it on.\\" That means you have the choice to accept God or shut Him out. C.S. Lewis is a tough author, but he makes it pretty clear with that statement. Then he blew me away with this self-examination of himself. See if this statement doesn't knock your socks off! \\"For the first time I examined myself with a seriously practical purpose. And there I found what appalled me; a zoo of lusts, a bedlam of ambitions, a nursery of fears, a harem of fondled hatreds. My name was Legion.\\" And I read THAT saying WHAT?! This is the great C.S. Lewis, the man that we as Christians put on a literal pedestal, and you have to realize that YES!!!, like the rest of us, he was just a human. Lewis was just your average Joe, then he found something awesome, that something was Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Through Christ, Lewis did amazing things. And he was indeed, an ordinary person who did some extraordinary things! This was just one of those things, and it will get the attention of the masses!d then, given a free choice.

Well, the conclusion of \\"The Martyr's Song\\" is a breezy one indeed, and some might say has sadly come to an end. But do not fret, for you can sing Nadia and Father Michael's song day after day just by being an example. Plus you get a cool CD featuring Todd Agnew, who sings \\"The Martyr's Song\\". Let me tell you this, it is beautiful! When my own daughter at nearly 19 months old attempted to sing this, WOW, it does have an impact.<br /><br />Take a journey with Marci. Enter a flower shop. Be drawn in with a story. Allow yourself to listen to the laughter, allow yourself to embrace the heartache, along with the triumph that follows! Watch something that has been beautiful since day one, discover for herself that she is indeed beautiful!<br /><br />Ted Dekker created a masterpiece with 3 books, and now a 4th novella has emerged. This is what made Ted Dekker who he is, and nobody can debate that.<br /><br />We as Christians can continue this story so graciously as Ivena did with young Marci, and simply pass the story on, and share it with others. Don't just keep it on the shelf as a decoration for others to see, it's too beautiful! So, in saying that, let the song live on in your life. Thank you, Ted Dekker, for the song that started it all!	2005-08-27

When I get it in my head that I want to read a certain author, there will be times where I run it by my wife. At times, she'll check out the title, and say something like, \\"Yeah, that doesn't look too bad.\\" Well, she made the comment about this series, and picked up this book, NOW she's waiting for \\"Breaker's Reef\\"! Go figure, right? She flew through these books, and I finally made my way through this one. In saying that, I have no regrets in giving Terri Blackstock the chance that she deserves, especially after my wife made me start with this one... AHEM!<br /><br />Well, welcome to a place called Cape Refuge! But don't wear out the welcome too long before you discover the murder of 2 of it's most beloved citizens, Wayne & Thelma Owens. You may try not to get too attached to the residents in Hanover House, but you'll probably have a hard time peeling yourself away. You may indeed find yourself fighting for Jonathan Cleary, as you learn that he is accused of this horrific act! But in a way, you'll hurt along with Morgan, and you'll get steamed like Blair as this mystery unravels itself. Don't be surprised if you find yourself watching bits and pieces of this like a hawk, as do the local judge, along with his wife.<br /><br />Cape Refuge asks the question, \\"Where is God when it hurts?\\" Don't we all ask that? Yeah, I believe we all do. But it also gives us the message of who is in control, and if you haven't figured it out yet, it isn't us! Not just yet. The likes of Gus Hampton would tell you something like, \\"Trust in God, mon, he be knowing best.\\" He knew the heart of one Terri Blackstock all too well, and that's the reason why the first of this series came out when it did. That deserves a huge thank you! This was written from the heart.	2005-08-26

Yes indeed that would be one definition for the word, and the book, \\"Flabbergasted\\". I really didn't know what to expect, but was glad I took a chance, and I'll be hunting for more of Ray Blackston.<br /><br />There was a little bits and pieces at times about this that I found to be slightly pesky, but it all came together. We meet Jay Jarvis, and we learn a few lessons along the way. We share his romantic interest of a missionary whom he gets to know on a weekend beach trip retreat. Lots of characters the whole way through, yet never confusing. Actually, it was really fun! It is inspiring, the faith of Allie that is so content. Some of the characters I took for granted such as Ransom, never thinking he would be a Bible study leader. I think that Ray shows the human side of even the toughest of people when the question arises of Jesus drinking a brew on the beach. Towards the end, you might find yourself asking the difference between tick and tock.<br /><br />So, with the occasional food fight, we are treated to poetry, and promised more of Jay Jarvis and his adventures. I'm looking forward to the ride!	2005-08-10

When you see a title of this nature, you can't help but gather the question marks in your head by the dozens! And I couldn't help but pick it up and find out for myself what it was all about. So, if you feel up to taking your chances, your first introduction will be to Francis Xavier Petrel.<br /><br />You meet Francis in his apartment, and realize that people take him as special. After all, he has to take medication, and he was released from Western State, a mental hospital.<br /><br />So John Katzenbach takes the approach like this: Suppose you are diagnosed as a mental case, yet you have a story, like so many of us do, but where to start? Why, on the walls of your apartment, of course!<br /><br />You discover that Francis, or C-Bird as the hospital knows him as, does indeed have a story. He has friends such as Peter the Fireman, one guy goes by the name of Napoleon, and there's a Newsman who lets everyone know of current events. There are 2 brother attendants, known as Big Black and Little Black. But it is kind of discouraging that your group therapy leader is known as Mister Evil! And it downright scares the crap out of you when killings start going on! And that's the story. Right? What kind of killer are we looking for? Well, at Western State, they call him The Angel. So, bring in the right outsider, and they just might tackle this turkey!<br /><br />I guess the question that C-Bird faces is simply, who's going to believe my story? He's been undermined his whole life, somewhat a born loser, but now it is HIS TURN! The question is, do you have the guts to read this tale of the supposed, MADMAN? Have some fun in the process if you do!	2005-08-05

Well, I picked up this with some anticipation, and in an anxious manner, both good and bad. Gansky is an incredible author, that's not to be debated. But the last book I read by him, I wasn't too impressed. His 3rd J.D. Stanton novel, \\"Out of Time\\" wasn't my favorite. But I was really hoping that this would redeem the Senior Pastor and author, and indeed he showed us once again what makes him great.<br /><br />This is the beginning of Perry Sachs, an engineer, and his adventures. Well, if you are looking for a page turner, this is worth it! Just imagine a secret! Yeah, one of those, \\"You aren't qualified to know\\" type deals, ok? So suppose this effort attracts the Mayor's attention. Could be trouble, right? It might even attract some negative attention. It could get action packed, and it may get bloody at times. Oh yes, this is a treasure, one that you'll share with friends and family, because you don't just keep something this good to yourself!<br /><br />In saying that, there are some good messages in this. One is to those who have ever blamed God for something. It gives you a certain amount of humility to realize that you shouldn't blame Him, although a lot of us do, myself included. There is nothing He can't handle, and nothing He can't forgive. Anne Fitzgerald found that out, and she also found that God's grace is so sweet.<br /><br />This is just the first of a 3 book series, and I'm hoping that the other 2 pack a punch like this one did!	2005-07-27

(quote-unquote)	The year is 2005, but I go back to the beginning of the year, checking out what new releases might be of interest to myself. My favorite authors all had new stuff coming out. But then you look to some of the new titles and you can clearly one thing. These guys have taken a chance. They have their first published novel out in the market. Chris Well was one of a few that I chose to take a chance with. Chris Well is one that is very well (yeah, hence the last name, amen?) worth taking a risk reading. Chris Well will be on my list in the future!<br /><br />I can easily say that early on the title, cover, EVERYTHING attracted my attention. There was one thing standing in the way. This isn't my first choice normally. And the way it was presented, I had to wonder, \\"Will this actually work in the Christian market?\\" Yes! I even wondered if it would be interesting with the short chapters, but it was. Made you keep turning the page!<br /><br />You take a contract killer, add a few BAMS! Take a detective, Tony Griggs, and add some good stuff, along with a message that delivers grace. And once I got into it, it was easy to accept that cusswords weren't a necessity to make this a good read! I could see a few times where Well kind of had to improvise, but he did it without compromising his message.<br /><br />So, you take some comic books, add a few Jolly Rancher candies to liven up the flavor, and sit back, and enjoy this read. You know you'll run into some good surprises as the smoke clears, and you won't be sorry. As you hear in some gangster clips, this is an offer you can't refuse! Oh yeah, Chris Well put his chips on the table, and it payed off.	2005-07-17

Man, he blows us away with action, and some top notch suspense that is pracitically haunting at times. Sometimes we might see that the story is about a dead lawyer, but Turow pretty much brings it alive for the most part.<br /><br />Telling this in the first person isn't the easiest thing to do, and it wasn't always easy to follow. But once you get past that, it is an enjoyable read. It might even be safe to say that this is a fatally attractive in some ways! I think that Carolyn Polhemus proves that with a few people, eh?<br /><br />So, what does this prove? That there are others out there other than Grisham that can write this stuff? Nah! But Scott Turow is different, and a read that is to be looked forward to in the future!	2005-07-12

I probably feel the exact same way as every person who has read this book when I say that I was excited, jumping out of my skin, and pumping my fist when I knew Peretti had this coming out in April. As I just finished this latest work, I look at reviews and see that some people loved it, some people hated it, and some people just don't know WHAT to think! If you have read Peretti like I've read Peretti, you KNOW this is not the best he's had to offer, but it was good. And while my usual rating for a good book might be an easy 4 stars, the stakes go up with Frank Peretti, and all I can give it is 3. I'll be the first to say that if you ever start reading Frank Peretti, don't start with \\"Monster\\", start with \\"This Present Darkness\\" or \\"The Oath\\", and then you'll know that I'm not being cruel by giving this 3 stars! Peretti's work normally makes people at first go \\"HUH?\\" then read on and be blown out of the water. But along with the \\"HUH's\\" were a few disappointed grunts from this long-time Peretti fan, and even though he wrapped it up with his usual brilliance, I had to let out a \\"Hmmph!\\" feeling a little cheated.<br /><br />This had so much potential! Reed and Beck Shelton hiking in the woods and BAM! No Beck! Where is she? The search is on! Peretti deals with a tough issue, dealing with Darwinism, evolution, and slapping a few people silly with God's truth. With the Sasquatches, Rachel, Leah, Jacob, I thought that was neat. But there were also times where it appeared Peretti tried a little too hard, and it took away from the book in my opinion. He also fell back on \\"The Oath\\" in this. When I read Peretti, I don't want to see something he's already done like a bear getting shot! Yeah, it worked in The Oath, but in this it was a distraction, I saw it coming, and I'm slapping myself, shaking my head, wishing that he could've made this better with a better distraction than a dumb bear.<br /><br />For me this was a quick read, but not one that I'll be picking up again. I won't be recommending this as a first time read to Peretti fans either. He can do so much better, and I wanna see it!in. I won't be recommending this as a first time read to Peretti fans either.

You know, I thought I loved \\"Searching For God Knows What\\" by the same author. Then I read this, and I REALLY LOVED \\"Blue Like Jazz\\"! I'll say this, you don't always know what you might get, but you do get more than what you figured. Make sense? Read it and find out!<br /><br />In this you get experience, and you get taken out of your comfort zone. You get real! Donald Miller refuses to sugarcoat his work, and he composes a literal symphony, oh yeah, a symphony for life!<br /><br />In the process, he practically dares us to take a walk on the wild side. This is about seeing other people as Jesus sees them, not just as the church itself sees. It is also about having a heart for the lost. Miller talks about loving those who are really tough to love, and I love Donald Miller for just laying it out there! While some authors are afraid to hurt a few feelings, Miller isn't afraid to say what's on his heart, and neither should we. A lot of laughter, along with some tears, and the whole time, a heart for something much bigger than ourselves!<br /><br />In his chapters he talks about belief being the birth of being cool, he adds a little magic, gives some advice on romance, and still has room for community, all the while doing it in love. Some people don't like Miller's theology, in which case, they've already missed the point! It isn't that tough, people, and Miller encourages us not to treat Christianity like some stupid math problem. But I love this man's work, and I don't have a problem with what he has to say, even if some of it does make me a little uncomfortable. Be human, and see what you're missing. You might just be surprised!	2005-07-06

This is the credit I give to Mr. Bunn. It is a book that probably won't be for everyone, but for some it will be just what they need for a little inspiration.<br /><br />You could almost mark this as a fictional \\"Catch Me if You Can\\", if anyone's read the book or seen the movie. Valentine Haines is EVERYWHERE in this cat and mouse type thriller! In a way, it sometimes gets just a little far fetched, but it still kept the pages turning for me. Bunn Makes a fist, and makes us deal with some very raw emotion. Take a little hatred, along with some vengeance motivated, add memory loss to fuel the fire a bit, and you've got \\"Lazarus Trap\\". Then just add the right gal and BOOM! You've got something worth reading here, worth the money, so to speak. Add some fisticuffs to the woodwork, just to make it interesting.<br /><br />While this has good action, and while the approach is harsh throughout, Bunn somehow manages to do it with the elegance he always maintains through a Davis Bunn read. I don't know HOW he does it, but that's what has made him an author to read in the past. He also has a message, and it is worth sharing with everyone. That's what keeps me coming back for more, every time!	2005-06-26

Yeah, I guess sometimes that would be the description of Steve Alstead, right? Keeps getting pulled away from that lovely wife of his and he sings the blues on occasion. So, while this didn't completely blow me away, it did keep my attention after getting it going, and I'm glad that I sang the blues with Jake Thoene.<br /><br />WE'VE GOT CYANIDE! Oh, and Miles has a cool thing going on, and it happens to be called \\"Firefly\\", right? That's where the title comes into play. We have a few Mexicans to deal with, and like Taco Bell said before, \\"SEND 'EM RUNNIN' FOR THE BORDER!\\" or was it Ray Charles that said, \\"Hit the road, Jack\\"? But hey, a decent addition to a series that started off very well. Senator Morrison and the rest of the team makes sure the action is pure, yet interesting entertainment. Add Kristi Kross, and ask Steve's wife how exciting it can get! Just kidding.<br /><br />What I appreciate the most about Jake Thoene is his love for country. Not only that, but he isn't ashamed of his God either. The God that built my America! That's something you don't always see these days. SO, while I prepare myself for \\"Fuel The Fire\\", I'll probably need a good pitcher of iced tea on hand. Good flames the whole way around so far.	2005-06-18

OK, before I set out to do my review, who actually out there, sat down and read this book, page by page by page? Hmm? OK! Now after you answer that one for yourself, yeah, you might need to reevaluate a little bit.<br /><br />A lot of people sure do hate Ryan Dobson, and then some people say, \\"Well, daddy's boy finally got himself out on the market, and I hate him too!\\" Yeah? YEAH RIGHT! At least he's right, people! At least Ryan Dobson doesn't make excuses for what he believes in, does he? At least he's intolerant and doesn't put up with the lame excuses! And you (I'm referring to the 1 and 2 star reviews, or the constipated reviews, as I like to put it) actually believe that he wrote such a book with Jefferson Scott just because he hates your guts and sinners like you, ME AND HIM! The very fact that he had the nerve to write such a book for the sake of Christ's Kingdom shows me that this man has a lot of love for a few people, and he isn't afraid to let the world know. Now, some people might say that Ryan did this just because his parents raised him this way. First of all, mom and dad or no mom and dad, the way they raise you hardly has any impact on you, me, or any other average Joe out there. You have to have a personal passion for people, then you have to go out there and execute the plan! We all make our own choices, this one a rather bold one, I'll admit it right away. But can I suggest that the plans Ryan Dobson lays out might just be the only plans, for God's only plan? Like it or not, he's right, and everyone else is wrong!<br /><br />He encourages us to be somebody's hero. Care enough to be a hero, and care enough to confront people, but to do it in love. My dad once told me he didn't want me drinking and driving. Why? Because he'd ruin my fun and because I loved it so much? Nah, my dad just loved me enough to let me know that what I was doing was pretty stupid. Duane Blue, and ex-biker, had a past that not too many people could claim. As a speaker now, he simply closes by making a statement like this. That people in your community will come after you, but the church sits around while people all over the world are going to Hell. John Hagee once told a man who didn't believe in Hell this, \\"I don't care what you believe, it's still there, and YOU'RE STILL GOING!!!\\" Pretty blunt, and pretty intolerant, but it just might get people thinking pretty seriously. Is Jesus the only way to God? Oh, you better believe it! And I love people enough to say it. Is abortion wrong, is homosexuality wrong? YES! Am I being mean and rude by saying that? Nope, I'm just trying to save you.<br /><br />In closing, this is like the Christian who was out with the atheist on a duck hunting trip. The atheist happened to ask the Christian, \\"What's the difference between you and me?\\" Well, no sooner did he ask that, and 2 ducks hit the air and the hunter raised his gun... BOOM! BOOM!! One hit the ground dead, the other was wounded and was flapping around like crazy, doing what he could to survive. The Christian looked right at the other fellow and simply said this, \\"See those ducks? I'm the wounded duck, and I just keep a'strugglin' along, day by day. But you, sir, are the dead duck.\\" Folks, without Christ, we're nothing but dead ducks. Which one are you?ow, he simply closes by making a statement like this.

I know, I know, it is Jon Stewart, but I thought it might have more depth. It just goes to show you what some people actually consider \\"quality time\\", and in this case, nice try! I personally got a laugh out of all the reviews who said that this book is a thoughtful read. You'll also find these people finding brilliance in Larry, the Cable Guy, although Larry does have his moments. But all in all, not much depth here, people.<br /><br />I didn't find this book the least bit thoughtful, or even too much in depth, because it was all covered up by the ranting and raving, with not much thought to it at all. Some people like Jon Stewart don't need thought. They simply needed freedom of speech, freedom of choice, and then a book like this comes out of it. But I think he forgot his hip waders when he took on a project like this. (no applause, please)	2005-06-12
US	30212713	R22HQMWFSHNAZC	1578567459	246054935	Expiration Date	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Set up another date, because I'm hooked!	What can I say? Mr. Eric Wilson's 2nd book has well exceeded my expectations, and now I have to breath! WHEW! There, now that I got that out of the way, WOW!! Dealing with the human touch, he certainly brings a whole new meaning to the words \\"goose bumps\\", am I right? Just ask Clay Ryker! Because he's the one who has to deal with a few things, along with kind of a shady past. If you read Eric's first book, expect a visit from Vince Turney. There's more!<br /><br />This is a new kind of spiritual warfare, because Eric did this with bravado, and had me cringing most of the way. His first book was awesome and I was looking for things to compare it to, and I came up with some differences. In \\"Dark To Mortal Eyes\\" the chapter titles were icy. In \\"Expiration Date\\" however, they were chillingly haunting! Such as \\"The Below World\\" or in one part the title is \\"Up The Crooked Staircase\\". Early on a chapter title reads \\"No Turning Back\\" and followed up immediately by \\"The Deception\\". YAH!! In his first book he started the prologue at Devil's Elbow, while in this work, he simply states the title \\"The Devil's Work\\". Yep, that gives you the goose bumps! No doubt about it.<br /><br />The characters in this were awesome, some of them were downright suspenseful, take for example, Asgoth and Monde. You'll probably think they're about as charming as Henna. But I really like Kenny Preston. He never failed to intrigue me, yet in the process of it all, humor me. With his no fear attitude, some might call him a junior spy master. And with his games of Scrabble, his paper route, and a little friend named Gussy, he was easy to love and appreciate.<br /><br />I can only express this one way. I'm ready for another date, because now I'm hooked to Wilson's writing, and I'm not about to let go! Set this dude next to Ted Dekker and Dean Koontz, I do believe he's earned it!	2005-06-10

Randy Singer smokes in his latest, and just keeps getting better! All I can say is wow! But I originally said that for \\"Directed Verdict\\" so I have to say more. Just kidding, I'm more than happy to report after self indulging on this! My verdict? Pretty darn good! Maybe better.<br /><br />To say the least, this starts out with a bang! Tara Bannister isn't taking anymore from her step-father! And Leslie Connors is gonna help her. Her soon-to-be husband, Brad Carson will do what he can to help. And of course, Bella, the secretary keeps things interesting throughout the whole ordeal. And Sarah Reed, a firm believer in Christ, will be praying in the midst of all this mess. And hey, Leslie tells this all in the first person. Pretty impressive if you ask me. And it was self defense, right? Surely Tara is out of harm's way, no irreparable harm done, right? WHOA! WAIT!!<br /><br />Did I just say \\"irreparable harm\\"? WRONG BOOK! Yep, wrong book, but right character. Mitchell Taylor enters the picture to take on Tara! If you've read some of Singer's previous works, you may see a ghost or 2 from the past emerge with charm, or maybe in a detestable sort of nature. Things are gonna get good, right? OK, awesome!<br /><br />So, read this, and you'll find out soon enough that this isn't just about self incrimination. Not just that. You'll probably find some elements of self defense, (of course) self sacrifice, and possibly some self indulgence. The last part is up to you, by the way! Read this with your heart, and you'll definitely get more than you bargained for. I guarantee it!	2005-06-03

But he kept the pages turning, and I cared about most of the characters, so saying that this book was a let-down for me is to say so with much reluctance. But in saying that, Koontz is a highly accomplished author, and nobody can take that away from him.<br /><br />You meet a bunch of people in this. Right off the bat you meet Dom, you learn about his sleepwalking episodes. You meet the good doctor, Ginger, whom you might learn to care about. You run into the likes of Jack Twist, who has turned to a life of crime after his country let him down, and let his wife suffer. You come across the Tranquility Motel, and then the grill. Quite mysterious to some people. Sometimes you reach a somewhat hypnotic state for some of our beloved characters. Unfortunately for me, I found a lot of dull and boring spots during this read.<br /><br />Almost 700 pages, WOW! Koontz did indeed have some stuff on his mind, and it is a best seller. But for me it wasn't one of his best reads. But it won't keep me away from his other works, because I'm no stranger to Dean Koontz!	2005-05-26

Ok, now that I got your attention, I guess an explanation is probably due, right? Ok, you got it! My wife and I picked up this book originally for a Bible study. I can most certainly say that I was indeed excited about it. In saying that, it really wasn't for me, but on the other side of that, you have the other crowd who got everything you can get out of this book. Some people will without hesitation say, \\"OH, this book just changed my life! I'm going to re-read this book over and over again. I'd pee my pants without this book!\\" and I wonder if they've made the fatal mistake of reading this book in place of daily scripture. I really don't know. But then my church decided to do the \\"40 Days of Purpose\\".<br /><br />And right away you had the same thing, only 1 other person said he wasn't getting anything out of it, simply because he wasn't reading it. But then I admitted that I got some out of it, but not a whole lot. Well, there's got to be something wrong with you then, RIGHT? What a bunch of bull! What I understood from the get-go is that I'm certainly not the exception that knows everything, it was just that I expected to be blown away. We even got the journal that goes along with it. And so I understand that we were indeed made for a purpose, that we aren't an accident, that God has a reason for our lives, a lot of stuff that I probably heard growing up in Sunday school. I also realize that this is a book of application. Hey, we were made for a mission, we were made for worship. Somebody even told me that if there's something God wants to get through to me, He'll use a sledge hammer. If He still can't get through, He might just use a jackhammer, and that that doesn't work, God will use something really big to get through to you or me. Stuff like that is good to know.<br /><br />The illustrations in this are awesome. Rick Warren quotes C.S. Lewis, and even takes from \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" with the final book about how the end of this life is just the beginning! That's good stuff! This book is filled with scripture, just look in the back at the references.<br /><br />But what really pissed me off about the whole thing was something I pointed out earlier. If you don't get something out of this book, and everyone else is, there's got to be something wrong with you, or you didn't put everything in this book, or you would SEE that you NEED this book to CHANGE YOUR LIFE! Only a handful of people understood that. And I agree wholeheartedly with one of the spotlight reviews. This book is a fad in the Christian church. The great comedian Jackie Mason had a better word for things like this, and they were called status symbols. Oh yeah! We even have them in the Christian church. Some are good, some are bad, some just you love or you hate, and unfortunately, this happens to be one of them. Jackie Mason said that anything that happens to be a status symbol, you either have to love it, or you're a putz if you don't. I guess that makes me the putz! I'm kind of ashamed to say that most of the people that understood my dislike came from my work, and only a select few from my church left me alone about it. But hey, when one of the leaders stands up in church and says, \\"Ok, now be honest. Who out there is having a great time with this, can I get a show of hands?\\" Do you really expect people NOT to show their hands for fear of being the black sheep? Let's get real!<br /><br />For the record, I feel that Warren wrote this for God, I have NO DOUBTS AT ALL! I don't think he just sat there at his desk and said, \\"HMM, bet this'll be a big moneymaker. How about THIS?!?\\" No, people who say that are just plain mean. And this isn't meant to be what some might call \\"a sugarcoated Bible\\". Not to sound unChristian, but either read the book and form your own opinion, or get the hell out of the way and read something else! Start with YOUR Bible if it bugs you so much. I can only say that if you read this, YEAH, try to get something out of it. If you don't, you don't. Big whoop! Me? I personally am looking forward to reading Donald Miller's \\"Blue Like Jazz\\" because I loved \\"Searching For God Knows What\\". But \\"The Purpose Driven Life\\" happens to be a bestseller. SO WHAT? Either you read it and get something out of it, or you don't. Don't form a constipated opinion without the facts, it really, REALLY makes you look stupid. I personally hope that there are people who get something out of this. God bless!If you don't, you don't. Big whoop! Me?

Does my 5 stars say enough? Probably not, except that I'll be looking more into Meltzer because I for one was impressed! Expect the water to get somewhat choppy if you plan to read this thriller.<br /><br />Join Oliver and Charlie Caruso for what appears to be possibly the ultimate crime, scam, take your pick, there isn't much difference. Take a stroll into Greene & Greene Bank, where two million just might get you an account, and possibly in their good graces. But it appears if Oliver and Charlie have been taken for a ride, and there might be a possible 3rd wheel. Involve the secret service, and you just might have one crazy chase on your hands! Get mom all worried, uh-oh!<br /><br />So, will there be deception? Just maybe. Corruption? Oh boy, oh boy! In saying that, you can count on it getting bloody! You can probably count on there being guns. And all at stake is the money, or possibly family! And I loved it. Brad Meltzer hit it rich with this man! You may even wonder if this could be an earth shaking valuable work of art that was meant to be a jackpot for the human soul. It'll have you asking questions, and hopefully coming back to the world of Brad Meltzer. Thanks for the thrills, and even for a few chills. I'll be back for more!	2005-05-11

The cover even suggests that this is going to be a blast, and the message within is straight from the heart. So, what's it all about? Let's see... a detective, a taxi cab, women here and there, a cult, 21 days of fasting (but not like Daniel), a king, and the Word of God. That's \\"Bye Bye Bertie\\" for you in a nutshell. If you are looking for some satire, you've come to the right place!<br /><br />I think Rick Dewhurst took a chance by writing this in the first person, and it paid off. He takes Joe LaFlam, private detective, and just rolls with it! And he had fun with it, which is obvious. And you know that this will probably be the type of book that is \\"too immature\\" for some people. Oh well! Hey, we as Christians need to laugh at ourselves sometimes and just roll with the punches! Don't worry about what might go wrong. And as Abner remarked when he encountered Joe LaFlam, \\"Maybe you private eyes ain't the same after all.\\"<br /><br />This book also has a lesson in it amidst the so-called turmoil. It simply teaches us that God might call us for bigger and better things. With that said, I hope there are people out there willing to take a chance on Rick Dewhurst. He's earned it, and the message is worth it. You'll get something out of this, trust me. You might even dance on the edge of your seat a time or two. Just don't sweat the small stuff!	2005-05-01

Just imagine that you just heard of this new discount store, and they have music CDs for a pretty reasonable price. You parents might shoo you out of the house, and the best you expect to find is between New Kids on The Block or Vanilla Ice. But, you walk in this store, and you see stuff that is on the top of your list! What's even more impressive is that it doesn't even look that used, it looks like it just might be in great condition! It did more than meet your expectations, right? You walk out of there with over $100.00 worth of stuff, paying under $40.00! In short, it was too good to be true, but it happened. This is exactly how I felt about this book. Didn't expect much, got a lot more than I bargained for! I didn't pay nothin' for it either! It was a Christmas present.<br /><br />But it was laying on my shelf, pretty much on my \\"I'll read this later\\" list, when I get to it. Well, Christmas is over, and LATER is here, has BEEN here! And when your wife is the one who got you that Christmas present, you want to at least appear appreciative, right? The fact of the matter is that I never intended to read ANYTHING by Randall Ingermanson, mainly because Sci-Fi has never really been my first choice. And I confess that I made kind of a harsh judgement from the get-go. I opened the package and was like, \\"WOW!\\" Look at the cover. \\"It actually LOOKS good. It actually catches my attention, in all honesty.\\" Read what it says on the back, \\"Hmm! Yeah, that looks good. Might not be too bad after all.\\" But then the prick in me takes a cheap shot and it goes something like this... \\"But it's written by HIM!!\\" So I tell my wife thank you, and on the book shelf it went. Until I took it OFF the shelf to read it and simply get it over with. And now I'm recommending it! Now you can read my review! Yeah!<br /><br />I guess the way to start this is simple. Read it in it's simplicity, or in it's complexity, you choose. But then again, that's what you get with Dillon Richard, a little of both. He's an engineer, and he's a genius. The Dillons out there will probably read this with pepperoni and pineapple pizza, with a glass of V8, or maybe a bowl of your favorite fruit salad will do as well. You have Rachel Myers, a fiery, passionate biophysicist with a big plan, or maybe more than one plan. Rachel would probably suggest you read this with beer and pretzels, and maybe some celery sticks as an afterthought. Then you have Keryn. Oh, sweet Keryn, practically innocent, who just wants to write her book, and maybe kill some dude named Josh. You have a lot of players in this. You'll see some quantum encryption mixed in with quantum physics, and quantum this and quantum that. Don't really know what that means, but it was really a blast! And something is up!

Because I found this book, along with \\"Blue Like Jazz\\" and decided to take my chances. Some might even feel that Miller took chances in writing a book like this. The chapters range from fine wine, to Shakespeare, and even a little nudity! With this comes some awesome insight, and might even have you asking if you are in kind of like a lifeboat type Christianity. Seeing some of these chapters might make one possibly say something like, \\"No way!\\" You have to read it, and then you have to understand where he is coming from, and you realize that it does indeed make good sense. Some might be objectionable to the fact that he uses words such as \\"crap\\" and \\"sucks\\" on occasion. Who cares? We need people to be open in their walk. That's what makes them genuine.<br /><br />Miller spends some time in Genesis, and takes on the Gospel. Awesome! Awesome because Miller looks at some of the points in Genesis, and has me laughing through some points, and then cringing because I can see the somewhat sobering way he describes things, and you do sometimes have to think about it. Yeah! At times this is a thinking person's book. You'll be wondering if that's true if you buy this book, you're driving in the car, you get home, and all of a sudden you see that chapter 2 says that Santa takes a leak! Trust me, it is all worth it! I thought the best chapter in the whole book was the longest and was simply put, Jesus. See if that doesn't blow your mind! That could've been the final chapter because I was going WOW! But it wasn't, and I buzzed through the rest of it refreshed and inspired!<br /><br />To be honest, I thought at first that it was going to be a little bit dry, but that changed rather quickly. Miller is very creative with his writing, sometimes point blank and doesn't apologize for it. Don't start reading this and then expect an apology, not this time! If you are looking for real, look here. Donald Miller is special, and that's because he surprises us with these crazy titles, and then makes perfect sense of it. It wouldn't surprise me to see him come out with a title called, \\"No Way in Hell\\"! Now, if a title like that ever emerged from Miller's pen, you know you'd hear people saying, \\"That's supposed to be Christian?\\" with a title like that, right? OK! With that said, I loved this! No, it might not be what you (or myself at times) had in mind, it just might be more! It was something I needed to read, and an author I'll be looking for in the future!

For some reason I'd been putting it off to read something by Daniel Silva. When I finally did, it was a treat! Now in this, you might find see words like Jews, or Bolsheviks, and maybe even a Hebrew, all that among a few Italians in the Vatican. Is THAT what makes this an enjoyable read? Maybe, just maybe. There's other stuff that make this easy to enjoy as well.<br /><br />I really enjoyed my first meeting with Gabriel Allon, but at first it was a little easy for me to put it down here and there. But once I got into it, it wasn't hard for me to get into this little gem. For those of you who haven't experienced a Silva read, I'll let you in on a secret, he's good! We are kept awake by espresso, treated to fine wine and sumptuous dining that is more than plentiful, followed by a bullet for dessert at times! Lions and tigers and bears? oh no! But there might be a Leopard lurking in the shadows. Watch out! It isn't always pretty. In fact, it might get down right dirty and ugly! You may even be introduced to the Pope. Oh yeah, this will keep readers guessing!<br /><br />Hey, this dude really was worth it, and I'll be looking for more of Daniel Silva. I could use some more of this!	2005-04-18

You find out about this, and you love it too, right? Cheer up! It isn't over! I can't wait for BOO-HISS!<br /><br />The question in this book just might be something like, \\"What in the world is she up to?\\" But who's the \\"she\\" we're referring to? Could it be Ainsley, with dreams that reach the sky? Could it be the town busy-body, Miss Peeple, who ALWAYS has something up her sleeve? Or could it possibly be Melb, who needs to get a few things straight with Oliver!? Hey, we just can't get enough of Skary, amen?<br /><br />So, does Rene tickle the funny bone once again? Oh yeah! Hey, with a title like BOO-WHO, I expected a lot, and got even more, which Rene accomplishes every time she does a project like this. Real people, real humor, but also some real tears at times to actually make it real. That's what we need more of today, along with the genuine love of Christ. That is what Rene Gutteridge provides, which is why she is always a welcome addition to my bookshelf!	2005-04-06

From crossword puzzles to sugar pecans, Koontz creates, and triumphs! I got the book because it was just a regular paperback, planning on reading it much later in the year than now. But when you hear all the hype about this, for once just believe it and find out for yourself! Approach with caution, it'll grip you from the first page! Then the nouns, verbs, adjectives, all that good stuff just falls into place. The excitement Koontz serves up is very electrifying in more than one way! OK!<br /><br />Join EVERYBODY from Deucalion, the tattooed man, Carson O'Connor, the NO-FEAR detective, her partner, the arrogant, yet somewhat laid back, Michael Maddison. How long has Deucalion been dealing with his situation? What is his purpose? Maybe ask yourself how long this dude's actually been around for! You'll find out.<br /><br />At the same time, drink in the anxiety of Randall Six, with his crossword puzzles and daily routine. Yet stagger with fear while you observe Dr. Victor Helios. What kind of a man is the good doctor? Hey, is he a good doctor? How long must one endure? Enjoy the human side of all sides of this creation! Koontz quotes the great C.S. Lewis to prepare us, yet humbles even the likes of one Mary Shelley. Have I read Shelley's version? Nope? Am I likely to? Probably not. I think if Koontz were to hear that this isn't like Shelley's original, he'd probably be the first to say thank you. It wasn't meant to be.<br /><br />As usual with Koontz, expect the unexpected! Be pleased with as surprises arise, yet let your heart share in small bits of sorrow. But don't be surprised if you steal a few laughs as you bite off that last fingernail! We don't know what will happen next, but I do know this. I can't wait for more! The question is, do you dare take the risk of this first book?	2005-03-25

I guess this was one of those things where I saw the book, said that the book looked good, but merely considered reading it. Then, as book #3 (Fuel The Fire) was already on the shelves I finally picked up book #1. Go figure, right? But with a great, sometimes frantic pace, it was impossible to put down!<br /><br />It ripped, it roared, and it never snored! We join what is called the Chapter 16 team. This is after the fact that a bomb has obliterated a transit subway station. But you might think, the ultimate team? Oh, you bet! We learn that this team is put together by a Senator James Morrison, and as my own dumb joke I was wondering this: If people ever call him Jim Morrison, does he sometimes sing to himself, \\"This is the end!\\"? But in this book, that would be a bad guy song, right? Leave it to a former die-hard DOORS fan to think up something weird like that! ANYWAY!<br /><br />You have Special Agent Steve Alstead in charge of a team that isn't likely to lose. Hopefully not. In the midst of all the chaos, we learn what \\"Shaiton's Fire\\" is. Oh, do we ever!<br /><br />With an idea like this, along with good plots, combined with a little humor along the way, Jake Thoene has created a spark. One that already has 3 books and hopefully doesn't fizzle out after that. All I can say is thank you!	2005-03-25

Well, I can honestly say that I was warned about this book. But that was in a good way. My verdict? Right and wrong. One reviewer said that this might not be for adrenaline addicts, and is correct. But I didn't give a rip about the people! This didn't have me after certain chapters wiping my brow saying, \\"GEEZ!\\" or \\"Holy cow!\\" or even \\"Man alive, that was one heck of a twist!\\" Unfortunately it was more like, \\"Hmm, interesting. Yep.\\" It seemed like a lot of things fit too perfectly.<br /><br />But we take Father Grif who gets a late night phone call and discovers a dead body. Now Griffin Reed tells this in the first person. Famous person found dead in a chapel. Relatives, some that cared, some that hated him. The nagging sister of Father Griffin. Delffs does this, but not where I cared. The funny thing was that I got to the end, and was still kind of like, \\"Whoop-tee-doo. I still don't care!\\" Why? It just was, and there was nothing that struck me as outstanding about this. The best thing about this was I got it at the right price. Hey, you win a few, lose a few, but some like this just break even. And it probably won't convince me to read \\"The Judas Tree\\" too soon either, even though I have it too.	2005-03-18

But for me, this one took me over 100 pages to get into. The first 2 books had my attention like a good old fashioned Navy yardarm! That's the truth. But this one was so easy for me to just put down, and I hate to say it, hard for me not to completely put off. It wasn't the page turner I expected like his first 2 Stanton books, which I though were equally amazing. But Gansky didn't disappoint me the whole way, and I'm glad I stuck around for the whole round trip.<br /><br />We join Captain J.D. Stanton and a crew, along with a few misfits for some fun. He takes kids with some real problems, not just the problem that the nerd didn't get the prom queen to go out with him, nothing like that! We're talking about kids who need some guidance, someone they might be able to relate to, someone who actually cares. We have a big storm to increase the momentum of this adventure, and THEN we realize why Gansky calls this \\"Out of time\\"! AH-HA! So, we take an adventure on a catamaran and have the time of our lives. Just kidding, but it was still a good read. Altogether, while this wasn't my favorite J.D. Stanton book, I'd still recommend it and I'm still looking to read more by Alton Gansky. He's been around for awhile, and that's saying a lot these days!	2005-03-13

Hey, can you not look at the title to see that it will probably create (as God did the heavens and Earth) some controversy? When I walked into work with this book, I wondered to myself if maybe 1 or 2 of the chapters of this would get me fired. Jeffress cranks home with this, he isn't afraid to do so, and makes no apologies for what he says. He's looking for some wimp-free Christians! If you don't like that statement alone, then leave this book alone. So, YEAH! This book will probably step on a few toes to those who disagree with what Jeffress has to say, or for that matter, what God has to say.<br /><br />He basically starts his first chapter by offending most of the world by saying that every other religion in the world is wrong? For those of you who get your feelings hurt, I just want to ask a simple question. Is he wrong? Or are we really that intolerant? C'mon, people! I heard an awesome message by Jay Carty based on chapter 3 about God sending good people to Hell. It was an amazing message, and I've since passed it on. Now chapter 4, you show this to the wrong person in the work place, and you'll be stamped with labels like \\"bigot\\", \\"hatemonger\\" and all other kinds of nice names people can come up with. It is titled, \\"Homosexuality is a perversion\\" and I say AMEN to that! It's about time! Jesus Christ did not make us a fearful people, and Jeffress proves this with this particular chapter. He shows no fear. Hey, I confess that when I strolled into work with this book, I was concerned that if the wrong person saw this and looked at the chapters, would my job be in jeopardy. In today's day and age, it could very well happen! Then who's the intolerant bigot, amen?<br /><br />Does Robert Jeffress realize the heat he might take for writing something like this? Oh yes! This man is wading in shark infested waters with a book like this. I for one say that it's about time that somebody take a stand, and give it all he's got!!!<br />  <br />	2005-03-05

I guess for some reason, when we look at the back and see that the book is for parents and teenagers, we don't feel that it can apply to our lives. Don't let that fool you! Be prepared for something very special in \\"The Waiting\\" and don't be surprised if you can't put it down!<br /><br />Consider this a modern day Prodigal son story. Well, if you know the parable Jesus told, it seems pretty obvious what's about to happen. Or is it? You take in the life of John Michael Davis, with his 2 brothers, older brother, Lewis, and younger brother, Phillip. Then you have dad, Jonathan. But suppose John Michael is ready to go into the real world with a rather large sum of cash. Dad, you gonna give me the blessing? Well...OK. But you are always welcome here and I still love you. The little brother doesn't want him to leave. The older brother says basically, \\"Fare thee well!\\"<br /><br />Then he hits the streets. He meets some friends. A lot of these friends think he's crazy, seeing as how they've never actually had somebody like John Michael's dad who loves them. But because of your cash flow, you're always the man of the hour. That is until the obvious happens, you run out of money. What happens? You don't want to miss this!<br /><br />Jesus had a passion for parables. Mark Rempel has a passion for people!

This might be one of those you look at and a big question mark comes to mind. When my pastor's wife loaned it to me, I'll openly admit it wasn't exactly my first choice of what I wanted to read. We'll, it IS a first recommendation from myself! What a picture.<br /><br />We join a man named Simeon. A desperate man, to be blunt. To himself, a pathetic man. He has the scars to prove it. But while visiting his cousin, he meets Yeshua. He observes some of his followers, like Peter, and observes the crowds around this amazing man. It is close to Passover. We even get a picture of Pilate, Judas, and many more!<br /><br />This takes you to the cross. And beyond! You can face tomorrow, people! This actually comes close to \\"The Passion\\", but it still touches the heart and pierces the soul.<br /><br />My final thought is this: If someone loans this to you, read it. Not just another book! I loved it. And it isn't complex, so it makes for an easy read. Wow!	2005-02-24

You take your chances. I'm glad I took my chances. It was kind of like reading the \\"Dear Abby\\" section, but hearing both sides of the story, then hearing Judy's opinion. Issues concerning marriage, kids, parents, and what-not. I usually get a good laugh from reading the \\"Dear Abby\\" section in the paper because I feel if you actually have to have someone like that to solve your problems, there's no hope for you. So the title of this book was completely appropriate. But in being fair, some of the questions were actually legitimate.<br /><br />Hey, lots of people love Judge Judy because she tells it like it is. She still does in her book!

But there was something about this that had a lot of his pizzazz and zip, but it didn't seem like a whole lot of it in this one. Still impressive though, and still highly recommended. I almost wondered if this was an attempt to top \\"THR3E\\", and if that's the case, I don't think it's gonna happen. Not yet, anyway. When he said that it was for The Circle, I agree. The elements in this are undeniable.<br /><br />But there is the pursuit, the total obsession that drives Stephen Friedman to go as far as he does. A love for something, how far will he go? He is used to success!<br /><br />Then you look at Roth Braun. Whew! Ruthless sucker! You get a look at Nazism and the cruel mind games they were capable of. In short, Roth Braun is not a nice guy.<br /><br />But is Ted trying to repulse us? I don't think so. He's able to give a sense of reality that not too many people can put on paper. In another way, he does get down and dirty in this! I liked that. Love and war? Yeah, why not?<br /><br />So, I guess the attitude towards DeKker's work for me works kind of like this... MINE! MINE!!

He also knows how to lift the spirit, than let us know who is in charge and why.<br /><br />He takes a friend of journalist, Jake Woods, and gives us that is just as equal to \\"Deadline\\"! We join Clarence Abernathy in his search for justice. He teams up with Ollie Chandler, who seems to be a hick. But the two forge an unforgettable friendship, as well as a good team! This book takes you into the heart of racism, then power drives it with a force that can't be stopped. I really liked how Obadiah (Clarence's father) simply talked about the good old days, especially the part about Negro League Baseball. He talks about Hank Aaron along with Cool Papa Bell, and tells about the earth shattering home runs of Josh Gibson. You read baseball books, you know this isn't just made up stuff. We are also given verses of \\"Amazing Grace\\" and other tunes that just light up your world, and God's world! To make matters more interesting and more sumptuous, he gives a tempting decription of home cooking, with more than just corn bread and chicken!<br /><br />Alcorn writes something that probably won't be popular with all audiences, but he doesn't have to worry about that. This was never a skin issue, but a SIN issue, and when it comes down to it, when does it end? What will the body of Christ do about it? More heart pounding illustrations from Randy Alcorn make \\"Dominion\\" demanded to be read, today and tomorrow. It is why he is one of the best out there! Well done!	2005-02-11

Peretti had been pondering this for how many years!? If you've personally heard the message or watched the video, you know he struggled with it. When you normally listen to or watch a Frank Peretti message, he is ALWAYS sobering, yet off the wall, going nuts, making some crazy noises now and then, yet always making a profound point. This time, minus some of those noises, he once again makes a profound point, in his most important message.<br /><br />Well, he talks about The Wounded Spirit. He talks about bullying. Where's this come from? He takes you inside his childhood. It started with a tumor. It escalated in school from just a simple scar to insensitive teasing and bullying. Kids pushing him around, saying, \\"That's the kid to pick on!\\" Frank was into monsters as a kid. He loved them! He said that he was into monsters because maybe he felt like one.<br /><br />Peretti mentions that he couldn't throw or catch a football in school, yet he tackles this subject like Lawrence Taylor ended Joe Theisman's career. Frank Peretti met this head on, probably with a little fear, but with dignity and no disgrace! I, myself, read this, as well as listened to this message with all the intensity and tenacity I could muster, and learned something about myself. That's the truth. I got messed with some in high school, but I did fight back, serving only a couple, but enough knuckle sandwiches to those who really pushed me. I'm a PK (preacher's kid) and some people like to mess with the PK. Today I can say that I make my attempts to stand up for the underdog. I still have my imperfections, and so does everyone else.<br /><br />Hey, this message is from everyone. All ages, people. Nobody is immune, and people getting pushed around happens to some a lot more than others. Peretti attacks this subject with fierce determination. He challenges us to stand up for those who can't stand up for themselves. I challenge anyone to take in this message, if you have the guts! We need more stuff like this.

Getting the treasury of Beatrix Potter was like WOW! This is a lot of good stuff, and while a little advanced, kids normally get the meaning and lesson through every story. I loved reading stuff like \\"The Floppsy Bunnies\\" and going to Tom Kitten, while wondering about stuff I don't remember reading like Jemima Puddle-Duck.

I gave it about 50 pages, thought it was going to be another slasher book, picked it up again, and gave it 50 more pages. Then I realized why it won the Bram Stoker award. Unfortunately, I think that there will be people who have their prejudices about an Indian author. I challenge those people to overcome them, and to take this on with an open mind. You can easily see that Owl Goingback has his beliefs, and isn't ashamed of his heritage. Something I respect.<br /><br />So yeah, this will have a fair share of bloodshed, but look for something more in the process. Take in the legend of the Crota. Read about great Indians such as Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa. If you know your history worth a lick, those aren't made up Indian names. They are as real as you and me, and to people such as Owl Goingback, they mean more than just names and campfire stories.<br /><br />Get ready for fun adventure!

When you view previous works of an author, and the results aren't always the best, the first reaction is to just take the advice, and spend your money on something you'd like. This was a case where I ignored a lot of critics and took my chances. Now, I won't go as far as to show interest in Sherlock Holmes, or G.K. Chesterton mysteries, but this caught my attention. What also caught my attention was the author's name. When I see a name like \\"Kel\\", only 1 thing comes to my brain for some strange reason. I used to watch \\"Kenan & Kel\\" on Nickelodeon, and was wondering if Kel attempted writing stuff like this. NO, Kel Richards is from Australia, and this was pretty good.<br /><br />We join a somewhat reluctant Nick Hamilton, a journalist, as he takes an expedition to a remote place called Cavendish Island, along with a team of workers. There is a professor, the captain of The Covenant, the ship that takes them to Cavendish Island, and you go on a rocky adventure! A lot of characters, a doctor who claims to be an atheist, a hard core professor, and you are sure to run into a few surprises. Cavendish Island, by the way, has a history of mystical power. You find out through a journal of a Lieutanant Edmund McDermott, an officer of the 1800s of the New South Wales Corps, that it does have a mean history indeed! One that goes as far as Satanism. You find out that some of these people on the expedition are into a little white magic.<br /><br />All in all, this paints a picture of God in the bad times. Kel Richards is a Christian author. One of his influences is C.S. Lewis. God's word tells us of countless times where many people, including Jesus, prayed not for their will, but for God's will. Putting on the whole armor of God is an essential, especially in the roughest and toughest times we face in our walk. But hey, get ready for some excitement, a walk or two on the beach, and have a blast! This passes for good stuff, and I hope Kel Richards has some more stuff like this planned for the future. He knows his stuff, and I thoroughly enjoyed the adventure! This is dangerous stuff.his planned for the future. He knows his stuff, and I thoroughly enjoyed the adventure!

Ok, I've seen a couple of things with this book. Things like, \\"2nd book is 2nd best\\" and that there is better Christian fiction out there. Let's get real! While this wasn't the most original, and while it certainly wasn't \\"The Resurrection File\\", it was just as good, but in its own way. Craig Parshall is a whiz at what he does, and he does better at showing the human heart.<br /><br />We rejoin Will Chambers as he is dragged in a custody dispute, one where the odds are against him... BIG time! He goes from Virginia to Georgia to the rescue of Mary Sue Fellows and her husband Joe. Against their little boy, they are accused of the unthinkable. Diving deeper into this, it looks tainted. Will takes on everyone, and has to lick his wounds and keep pressing on. And if that weren't bad enough, we look at the struggle of his relationship with Fiona. Will Chambers is a smokin' gun!<br /><br />Get ready for some good twists and turns, but don't look to put it down once you've started! There's a plane scene in this book that has some good twists as well! Hey, with his first book, I thought Parshall had something pretty tough to compare with. In this, he shows he has the chops to make a case for himself, and he squelches all futile arguments about his work! Don't quit writing, Craig, we want to see more good work like this. Bring it on, and keep 'em coming!	2005-01-20

He includes everything but the kitchen sink in this thriller! It is easy to figure out why there are people out there that consider Koontz one of the best!<br /><br />I can imagine being the person of Ethan Truman, and sometimes feeling the anxiety. But then you think also of what it might be like to Fric. Koontz throws a lot of stuff together. From Broadway roses, to Jewish food, maybe even a dead body here and there, right? I enjoyed the NO FEAR attitude of Hazard Yancy. Corky Luputa made kind of an obnoxious villain, yet a worthy opponent.<br /><br />While it kept my attention, it was easy at times to put down. However, near the ending, it goes nuts, and you find yourself saying, \\"He did it again.\\" So, all in all, Koontz does not disappoint. He thrills us, entertains us, and for some people, he actually inspires us. No harm done there.	2005-01-14

Real original, Groom. Lt. Dan, reunited? That was actually ok.<br /><br />If there was 1 thing I could actually pin point and agree with 100%, it would have to be a kid's reaction to his new creation, New Coke when he said, \\"EEWW!! This tastes like [...]\\" Yeah, and it read like it, too! 100 pounds of pure waste of it, along with a real waste of talent. I ain't readin' no more of Winston Groom! If you wanted a best selling sequel, write something that actually sells. Not over 350 pages of pure BS! I at least hope his effort was worth it. What a waste of time. What a shame!	2005-01-05

I started 2005 with \\"BOO\\" by Rene Gutteridge, and after the drag at work had me so pooped, I picked up this book that I got as a Christmas present, and was hooked. I'd put my daughter to bed for the evening, and I'm glad she was sleeping, because within a few pages, I was rolling with laughter! There were places in this book where I'd be on lunch in the break room at work, I'd start literally howling, and people wondered what was up. So, expect people to wonder where your medication is when you read this, and tell them, \\"THIS is IT!\\"<br /><br />I remembered when I first heard the main man's name was Wolfe, the same name as myself. Now, I was named after author Thomas Wolfe, but I never figured I'd run into a book that would catch my attention with the main character named Wolfe. But, he becomes a Christian in this town called Skary. What makes things really weird is the fact that he's a well known horror writer, and this town is all about Wolfe Boone, better known as Boo. So, leave it to Miss Missy Peeple, the town gossip, to try and get things back to the way they were. And Ainsley Parker, daughter of the Sheriff is the main attraction of Mr. Wolfe Boone. Ainsley Parker, works at The Haunted Mansion, which happens to be a restaurant that has delightful choices. How about some queasy quesadillas, with some bloody fingers. Maybe have the special of the day, Mad Cow meat loaf with a screamy potato?<br /><br />But Wolfe is what I'd call a very likable person. People want to know who witnessed to him in the first place. I mean, his editor, Alfred Tennison even wants to know when his next work is due out, and man, are citizens of Skary sure getting nervous! And while Wolfe is someone you like instantly, you really learn to dislike Missy Peeple. Believe you, me, you'll be able to picture people just like her while enjoying this work. I actually took a personal liking to Thief.<br /><br />Yet, even among all the hilarity of this, there is a somber message within the pages of this crazy, sometimes out of control work by Rene Gutteridge. I thought \\"Ghost Writer\\" made me an instant fan! This is one author more than welcome on my bookshelf!e pages of this crazy, sometimes out of control work by Rene Gutteridge.

After reading \\"Bad Ground\\", I was literally blown away, and my expectations for this was high. It started out great, but while the pages kept turning, it took about 90 pages after the first chapter for me to really get into it. But Cramer still shows his stuff, and conducts an orchestra for all to hear!<br /><br />This is a book with a lot of pain, even going as far as to ask the question \\"WHY?\\" a few times. Some chapters even start with entries from Jake Mahaffey's journal. But we also get a look in the life of Harley. But there are people who are skeptical of this new stranger in town, and frankly don't want it disturbed anymore than it has to be. You take a look at Miss Agnes Dewberry, a spry old gal who takes Harley in. You see the life of Web Holcombe, used to having things his way. You look at Web's son, Eddy, and his best buddy, Marcus and how they romp and stomp together. By the way, I loved the baseball chapter!<br /><br />But you take this the whole way through, and it all adds up to one thing in the end, faith. This was a good read, and I can't wait for Mr. Cramer's next work to emerge! I'll have to be patient!	2004-12-31

First of all, I am a Pastor's son, just in case anyone didn't know. Yeah, the title of this book is called, \\"And the Shofar Blew\\". I'm here to tell you, Francine Rivers blasts a mighty loud horn! I am thankful that my dad never fell into the traps that Paul Hudson did in this. One thing we need to admit, Pastor's are called, but they are far from perfect! I know that from experience. But Rivers isn't just writing this to point out all the faults of Pastors. But on the other hand, this stuff really happens, and if we think it doesn't, we've been deceived!<br /><br />Paul Hudson wants to follow in his father's footsteps. He wants to build a large church. He appears to do so, but what's going on behind the scenes? What's going on at home? Does God have a say in ANY of this? This is also a doggone challenge of accountability. Something that Christians need, with either a brother or sister in Christ! We also need to listen to what God would have to say to us, and then act upon that. And on top of all of that, we need to take helpful advice from elders of the church. I'm a greeter in our church, but I'm not afraid to ask our head greeter for advice, should a question arise.<br /><br />This also paints a picture of a broken man, what his choices have done to those around him, and how to deal with it ultimately. It paints a very real picture of brokenness, and forgiveness. I can say that, because I've seen it, and wrapped my arms around a brother who was devastated by his actions, and all I could tell him was, \\"I love you!\\"<br /><br />You WILL feel the stress of this story, you WILL taste tension, and you WILL not be able to deny who is in complete control! Francine Rivers does not write with bull crap as a back up. She writes the truth, no matter how bad it may hurt, but she always gives hope, because she knows in Whom it is! Amen!	2004-12-27

Let me be very frank to begin with...I do not like racing! I've never liked it, Jeff Gordan never caught my attention, Richard Petty caught my eye a few times when I was little, but racing was never my thing. I was always into baseball, football, boxing, and racing was never something I could watch. So why did I read a book like this? The first reason was because I've been looking for some kind of Christian sports fiction book that would hold my attention, which this certainly did! The second reason was because I liked Morrisey's first book, \\"Yucatan Deep\\" and I wanted to see if this would be good. It was better!<br /><br />We take a look at driver, Chance Reynolds. He is an awesome driver, knows how to keep his cool on a racetrack. But his career is cut short. Chance is also a Christian, with a wife who is expecting. He has to let his faith to the talking, and let God be his guide. While this is going on, his friend and teammate, Lyle Danford has problems with his youngest boy, Duane. I really liked how Morrisey got creative with names in the book. Like when Chance gets hurt, his replacement is a rookie named Gage Grissom. And I suppose that like a good race, this had some solid twists and turns! And might I add, this book is redneck through and through! I loved the way it was written. Very creative!<br /><br />Some might say that this is overly-preachy, but you can tell right away that while racing is a focal point in this, it isn't the main goal. Some people might even complain that it is too perfect, which I really didn't see myself. Here's my final take on this. Maybe, just maybe, Tom Morrisey saw the whole picture, God's whole picture. Then he put it on paper, and impressed this man!<br /><br />Am I now a racing fan? Nope? Do I care to watch a race on TV? No way! Will I read more by Tom Morrisey? Oh yeah! Awesome work. Deserves a pat on the back!	2004-12-18

Great humor packed all in this book. Oh yeah, he talks about gettin' a whippin', about Bill Gaither, and he even makes us feel something every so often.<br /><br />He talks about an ugly nurse who made him pivot on his \\"good\\" foot after a terrible accident. He lets us know that no matter what kind of bad wraps we as Christians may get in life, it sure beats burning in Hell! How'd you like to have a condescending teacher with a name like Miss Barth?!<br /><br />Insight from Mark Lowry 101 is now in session! There are only 2 lessons. Jesus Christ, and fun to go along with it! The 2 things that a lot of people, including myself sometimes, take for granted!

Well, Robert Whitlow brings the Santee series to a close with a rather quick ending, yet altogether satisfying.<br /><br />We rejoin Rena Richardson, Alex Lindale, Ted Morgan, and a few new faces in this fight for the life of one Baxter Richardson. We get some sharp looks at Boris, Alex's dog, sulking from Misha the cat, and admiration from Ted. Although this wasn't the quickest Whitlow read, it is without a doubt a work anointed! Whitlow can be proud of this accomplishment.<br /><br />A good start, like Whitlow always does, yet it did seem to drag a little bit, and while it was uplifted our spirits, he could've taken a few pages. There was sometimes a slow burn. Sorry, Robert. While \\"Life Support\\" set up a grand finale, he produced a work that will appease his fan club, but I think many will agree that this isn't his best work. As a big time fan of Whitlow, I'd have to recommend \\"The Trial\\" as his best work to date. Yet he still takes us through life in the south, with smells of the best chicken fried steak, the sweetness of iced tea, and the splash of the ocean. Robert Whitlow is never at a loss for words.<br /><br />So hey, he slows his pace a little, yet keeps his eye on the goal, which he achieved! That's more than enough to keep me reading Robert Whitlow! I'll be anxiously awaiting his next book!	2004-12-11

This was a book that I thought could have been shortened by about 50 pages. Arvin loves to draw out the scene, sometimes tries a little too hard to slam his point home, yet makes for an entertaining read.<br /><br />He takes Henry Mathews back to his hometown of Council Grove, Kansas. His job is to execute a will of Tyler Crandall. It gets much more personal than that! He has to deal with a grown up child in Roger Crandall. But that's not all! There he runs into Raymond Boyd, otherwise known to the people of Council Grove as The Birdman. Birdman gets most of Tyler Crandall's estate, and boy is it worth a lot! He appears to be a loony, preaching in the middle of the park with his pet bird that he simply calls, \\"Bird\\". We find out that there is a past and that there are secrets! Sleazy stuff going on in this neck of the woods, let me tell you. This kind of reminded me of watching something Hitchcock style. The suspense is very real, the people are very real, and the situation is all too real!<br /><br />You can tell Reed Arvin has a message for people, yet not in a way that everybody will appreciate. If you can tolerate little things, then you can certainly accept \\"The Will\\" by Reed Arvin. In saying that, and considering his background, he walked the finest line you could, and he still succeeded. That took guts, but it could've been a fatal error! While it is good to have some brass in you, don't get too much, it could weigh you down in the end! When dealing with issues such as these, be certain of the foundation. That was what made this critical. Hopefully we'll see a true masterpiece from a work in the making. But in saying that, I'll be looking for more of his work!	2004-12-04

With the movie coming out titled, \\"Christmas With the Kranks\\", I was hoping that Tim Allen would actually fit the bill for a Grisham book turned movie. This was great, light, hilarious, and made you think in places.<br /><br />So, yeah, the title does indeed speak for itself, as that is indeed the plan for the Kranks as their daughter, Blair goes to Peru with the Peace Corps. So there will be no turkey, no gifts, no wine, no stupid fruit cakes, no Christmas tree, and no Frosty! You can't read this and can't help but laugh at some of the petty imperfections that practically every family goes through when they get ready for Christmas. Hey, there are some dumb things we do, but we know that the spirit of Christmas is a little bit stronger than stupid family differences! Here Grisham uses a little bit of surprise, yet mostly humor and tradition to make us laugh and smile.<br /><br />But through all the mess, there is a message, along with a little cheer and giving to boot. To all the people who bawled, whined, and boo-hooed because they expected a complex Grisham-like plot: What the heck were you expecting? It isn't little Joe Doe from the South Pole suing Santa's top corporate executive because he didn't get his X-Box! I don't think that negative comments on this will just mess up someone such as John Grisham. He knows who he is, and this is a classic! I personally am glad that it was more than that, and it didn't have to be complicated.<br /><br />So, for those with an open mind, enjoy this holiday treat along with some eggnog and Christmas cookies! If you don't like eggnog, coffee will do!	2004-11-24

It is also more worth my while than what I'll simply call \\"that other fantasy writer\\". AHEM!<br /><br />But we meet Byron Thorn on his Misrule day. I can appreciate a book every now and then opening up with a little mischief! There are a lot of characters. Centaurs, satyrs, lots of stuff to keep the mind occupied throughout the whole thing! And now I can truly say that I know what a griffin is. You can tell in places that Crowell has his influences, yet it doesn't bog down the story to where you can just yell copy-cat. It has original qualities. There is also great action in parts of this, along with some blood, sweat, although too many tears for my liking.<br /><br />All in all it was a great effort. An honest effort, and that's what I can appreciate about it.	2004-11-19

My only complaint is that it ended too quickly.

That punch was one that we saw coming, yet I wasn't about to block it.<br /><br />Ted threw us many curves in \\"White\\", and some of them are like, \\"WOW!! Oh man! No kidding?

Stanton, retired Navy Captain, he takes us above sea level, and then really has us seeing stars! It isn't often that a follow up book is as good as the first, yet this is an exception. Both \\"A Ship Possessed\\" and \\"Vanished\\" deal in spiritual warfare, yet in different ways.<br /><br />Gansky takes a community of Roanoke II, and then most of it disappears. Why? Yeah, that is the question. And J.D. Stanton has questions. He also has people such as Agent Tulley and Dr. Eddington, who have attitudes to go along with their jobs. I love it that Gansky re-introduces us to Dr. Hawking Striber from \\"A Ship Possessed\\".<br /><br />So, while you could say that Stanton starts out on Thanksgiving with turkey sandwiches, and ends this mission with turkey tacos while watching Monday Night Football, that is all irrelevant.

That world is homelessness.<br /><br />Grisham takes Michael Brock, and tells the story in the first person, and pulls off a great work! Michael Brock could care less about the homeless, until he has a violent confrontation with one, and survives. It changes his perspective somewhat. He is a big shot lawyer at Drake & Sweeney. But after his incident with the homeless man, he finds dirt within his firm. He goes to homeless shelters, finds himself caring. I found myself caring for characters in this book.<br /><br />Some people have accused Grisham of being preachy. If this book actually caused a few people to feel something, oh well. People may suck their thumbs about bits and pieces here and there, and that's when they need to put the book down, and suck your other thumb as well! Good grief! I'd kind of like to know what people were expecting, more or less. But I do find the reactions here and there to this book either praise worthy, or ridiculous. It goes to show that some people either have a heart, or have what may be known as retard-itis! Sometimes you have to wear a different set of shoes to know where they've been before you can judge. AHEM! Hey, if something convicted Grisham to put a little morality in his story, then more power to him!<br /><br />There have been so many books of Grisham's put on the big screen.

You think, \\"A love story!\\" Yep. You also think, \\"A story of acceptance.\\" You bet! Could forgiveness fit into this picture? Oh yeah! Grace? Uh-huh. And so much more! You may even laugh once or twice before this is over!<br /><br />While the beginning is long, it is brutal and terse to the extreme! A few places you jump back. You meet Angel and who she is. You learn what the despicable Duke turns her into. You learn she escapes Duke, and finds The Duchess and her brute, Magowan. But then Angel meets Michael Hosea! He knows he is to marry this woman, harlot or not. He marries her. She runs away from him! He takes her back. He treats her like a woman, not like a sex slave! Even Michael's own brother cannot except this woman.<br /><br />You feel something when God talks to Michael, and you cringe when the enemy beats Angel down with her haunted past! There is a fight scene in the book. A scene where Michael fights, and not many, if anyone, lays a hand on him. He fights relentlessly and when he's done he says, \\"Who else wants to get between me and my wife? Come on!\\" Awesome illustration of Christ and his children, better yet His bride. Rivers notes that when Michael fought, he hit square and he hit hard. And those he hit stayed down. I don't want that kind of wrath from my Father. But I do want Him fighting for me, telling Satan, \\"Back off, Sucker!!! This one is mine!\\"<br /><br />And do we deserve His love? No chance. But He loves us anyway!

I read the first 3 Left Behind books, and while I enjoyed them, I can wait for the rest of the series. Not so with this! I borrowed this book, so until I get book #2, the wait will be most anxious!<br /><br />BeauSeigneur tells you in the beginning to never assume that the characters speak for him. But this is based on scripture, and it is very clever, as well as very in depth as well as accurate! But it does keep one guessing.<br /><br />A few of the characters are as follows. Decker Hawthorne, he has lost everything, his family, and he works as a reporter. There is Christopher Goodman, who lives with Decker after the Disaster, and happens to be a clone. There is a man named Milner, who knows all about Christopher. Then there is the very mysterious Tibetan, Master Djwlij Kajm. Who are these people?<br /><br />You may be asking questions such as myself. Questions like, \\"What kind of title is that for a trilogy?\\" Hey, it is thrilling, exciting, and sometimes even a little chilling.<br /><br />LaHaye and Jenkins are good. BeauSeigneur is by far better. He has praise by authors such as Ted Dekker and W.G. Griffiths. Now he has my praise! Don't pay any attention to the knuckle-headed reviews that are negative.

He even describes the memory of the home run he gave up to Kirk Gibson in the 1984 World Series.<br /><br />All in all, an entertaining read. Who knew? Very good!	2004-10-12

You can admire the fact that this is a story of survival, yet overcoming fears that have haunted you for practically most of your life!<br /><br />You have Chyna Shepherd, who goes to visit her best friend's family, who hasn't really trusted anyone, and for good reason. Then you have Mr. Edgeler Foreman Vess. A collector, you might say. He has photos of his collections, before and after, so to speak. He even keeps a dead body on hand in his motor home, eyes sewn shut. But then you have Ariel, the innocent victim. Chyna learns that this will be Vess's next victim, and all she wants is to save Ariel from this psychopath.<br /><br />I found it haunting that in Vess's house, everything seemed perfectly normal, yet it was totally expected. And then the way that Vess used his name to form different words. But you also find it an inspiration when Chyna finds strength that she never thought she had when it matters the most.<br /><br />I thought that it was slow in some parts, yet a good read from start to finish. Although I will never eat a Hershey bar with almonds the same way anymore!	2004-10-05

This is a picture of real pain, a picture of promise, a picture of regrets. Do not misunderstand my title. I said that this is a read for SOME Christians. Why? Because there will be people who may read a few pages into it, and say, \\"AW, God can't work in that way!\\" But I'm here to tell everyone, even the skeptics, oh yes He does! This is a book for people who have had real pain in their life. This isn't a book for people without a backbone. Need I say more? Oh yeah!<br /><br />One thing you can't deny is the humor that Mr. Cramer uses in parts of this masterpiece. You also see just how creative one can be. You join 17 year old Jeremy after his mother dies. Her request is for him to find his Uncle Aiden. Uncle Aiden can give Jeremy something that his mother could never give, while Jeremy can give Aiden something that his mother could never give to his Uncle. His uncle is a miner. And with names (or nicknames)such as Geech, Weasel, Nanny, Tunk, and then of course Snake, who is Jeremy's Uncle Aiden, you see a wide variety of vision put into this book! But I wasn't the least bit surprised when the name \\"Bubba\\" came up once or twice halfway through!<br /><br />So, when you read this, get ready to feel something. Don't try to think too much, the book will do that for you. Get a cup of coffee, maybe a couple of homemade cookies to go along with this. Just have a good time, and see how our awesome God works! A very rare treasure indeed!	2004-09-29

And it was the first book I'd taken in by Rene Gutteridge. Very impressive!<br /><br />We join Jonathan Harper, a senior fiction editor. He receives an anonymous manuscript. But this is no ordinary piece of writing. It is about his life. And it is pretty accurate as well! On the other side of the table, he gets a draft from Clyde Baxter, his biggest author, who comes out of retirement, and takes a challenge by veering away from his westerns, to writing a thriller.<br /><br />But Jonathan's life isn't all it seems to be. He has it all, but his life is a mess, and his own wife and kids have become a secondary importance to him. But what about God? Where does He fit into all this?<br /><br />A great read with a chilling ending! I will definitely read more by Rene Gutteridge in the future! Great work!	2004-09-23

It is still relevant to today's society. Man, what a powerful statment about our nation! Some people might call this the \\"Bill Clinton turned George Bush\\" fantasy, but it is so much more.<br /><br />What I found out about this was that Hudson wasn't afraid to say what so many people are. He knows who he believes in, and is persuaded that He is able. Amen!<br /><br />He takes the character of President William Harrison and asks a simple, yet complex question. What if we had a president, who knew Christians, had a family that was mostly Christian, knew about Christ, didn't really care about Christ, and then came to know Christ? I know some of the situations in this book. What it is like to say that homosexuality is wrong, just to be targeted as a bigot, or to have people say, \\"You hate me just because I'm different and not like you, don't you?\\" And to top it off, they treat the situation as if they were born that way. Give me a break, people! DDDUUUUHHHHH!!<br /><br />This was very interesting, and the heart of the matter hammered home the message. Well done, Mr. Hudson, for having some guts! We need more people like you.	2004-09-15

He starts in the bowels of Poland, and takes us on an unforgettable journey.<br /><br />You join an order of priests, including Father Thierry and Father Stephen. You also learn about a Harvard student, her name is Nora, and you also realize there is one more piece of the puzzle. A man on a mission. Who is he? What's going on? WHY? And you love it! And as the story keeps going, so you get engulfed all the more! Kind of like dining at its finest, once experienced, you crave it all the more.<br /><br />I saw this as an awesome illustration of one man's failures, yet in trying to save one person. Trying to eliminate a destroyer. You see this man, all blood, all sweat, and all tears! Doesn't hold anything back! A true scrapper to the end!<br /><br />Publisher's Weekly thought that readers would have trouble sticking with this one. Well, it wasn't the easiest read at first, things came together quickly enough. Then it made sense. I was able to absorb it somewhat easily. My advice would be for readers to take their time.

Daniel is an educated man, with not much use for God, while his wife, Lisabeth, is a devoted Christian.<br /><br />But when things go wrong, Daniel is forced to deal with something even beyond his belief in God. He chooses to deal with the thing responsible for the deaths of some of his comrades, but more importantly, he does this for the sake of Lisabeth, and his son, Michael. He encounters a cavern, home of the mysterious Chayatocha. What will happen? He also will encounter a few other beings that are quite mysterious. He meets people such as Gorgathuus, and a stranger named Lucky. You may even see a resemblence to the apostle Peter in a man named John Forrester.<br /><br />Call this spiritual warfare, old school style!

This is how Morrie Shwartz described to Ted Koppel, the way he wanted to live. It seems as though Mitch Albom saw that, and so much more in his old teacher.<br /><br />We find Mitch at a point in his life where he is basically consumed by his career. That is, until he sees \\"Nightline\\" and it features his old professor. So, every Tuesday he visits his old teacher for one final class, to work on their final thesis. Mitch finds himself admiring the way Morrie used to dance with students, how when he was so sick he missed going for that daily swim. While Morrie would enjoy life, with observations such as, \\"Age is not a competitive issue. Think of all I can be! I am every age, up to my own.\\" With life lessons such as forgiveness, and even saying goodbye. Simple pleasures in life. That's what Morrie taught. During a period in the Vietnam war, he gave all his students A's!<br /><br />This isn't a book you have to think about. It is beautiful.	2004-08-24

A beloved mentor once told me, \\"You've got to believe, on the authority of God's Word, that He can overcome any situation. And you have to believe that the blood of Jesus Christ can overcome this situation. Either you believe that, or you don't.\\" Pretty point blank, huh? That's how this was to me. Absolutely chilling in some places, and I loved it!<br /><br />This was my first work by Collins. We are taken through a complete mind game. You join Chelsea Adams, and her visions. She claims they are from God, and they've been proven helpful in the past. But now what? What about the man her husband wants as vice president for his company, Gavil Harrison? Is he a killer? From one encounter in a restaurant, it seems very likely, to her anyway, but she isn't certain!<br /><br />But then she takes this to the police. Bad enough that her husband, Paul, isn't a believer, but the investigating officer, Dan Reiger is! Yet, his partner, Pat Turnbow is not. The vision even leads her to the scene of the crime! The investigation leads to an arrest, goes to trial! The town of Haverlon, California has never seen something such as this. So, the question is, will all be well once the gavel is slammed down?<br /><br />Put Brandilyn Collins right up there with Ted Dekker! But give God the glory. There is one thing I know for certain about this. No wait, two things. The first thing is, I'll be reading more of Brandilyn Collins in the future.

This was an awesome work by Jim Cymbala! I love how he tells it like it is! I'm living proof of how Cymbala said that as a Christian, you will be tested and you will go through trials.<br /><br />There are a lot of great true stories in this, including David Berkowitz, (Son of Sam) and lots of people who are in Cymbala's church today. This is basically about letting The Holy Spirit work through us! And Cymbala has the scripture verses to back it up.<br /><br />My only regret is that I seem to be reading his works backwards, so now I have to find \\"Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire\\" and \\"Fresh Faith\\". And some people say about this book, \\"Ah, this is nothing compared to his earlier works.\\" I guess those will be 5 stars as well. This was awesome!	2004-08-19

I knew there was a sequel to Dead Air, and when I found out that it dealt with the subject of death metal, I rolled my eyes just a little bit. But what people don't realize is, is that there really is stuff like that out there that is written in the pages of Abaddon. Now, a lot of you, like myself don't or didn't know what Abaddon meant before reading this book. So, I took the liberty of looking it up in Websters, and here's what it said... It defines Abaddon as &quot;The destroyer, or angel of the bottomless pit; -- the same as Apollyon and Asmodeus.&quot; Read this book, and you'll find references to the name Asmodeus within the pages as well.<br /><br /> We rejoin Wes Bryant. He is married now to beautiful Annette, and is general manager of KVCE. He discovers some things about his step daughter, Jennifer. Blood on the bathroom mirror, behavior that isn't her own. Enter Night Sacrifice. A death metal band, with demented lead singer Clint Blade who is deceived by Satan. Wes's son-in-law, Mark refers Wes, Annette, and Jennifer to a Dr. Brown, who knows his stuff about spiritual warfare.<br /><br /> There are people out there who would like us to believe that music such as &quot;death metal&quot;, &quot;black metal&quot; is merely entertainment. A lot of it is the work of Satan. Bands such as Slayer, Morbid Angel, Death, bands who do the work of Satan, and they don't want people to know that. I'd advise people not to be fooled. Choose your entertainment wisely.<br /><br /> On a closing note, I'd just like to say that I, myself also listen to heavy metal. But the stuff I listen to is Christian, proclaiming the Good News! Bands like Tourniquet, Bride, Deliverance, Barren Cross, Mortification, all bands who stand by what they believe in. They believe in the Blood of Christ! These aren't just bands who sing &quot;Praise God!&quot; and then go get drunk and light up joints. Yeah, let's at least admit that music is music. But let's also try to stand by Psalm 150 that tells us to make a joyful noise!! And might I add, that clashing cymbals and stringed instruments are included in that particular passage! Let's just remember to glorify our Father who gave us that music. Don't give the devil anymore credit! If he reminds you about YOUR past, remind him about HIS FUTURE!!salm 150 that tells us to make a joyful noise!!

He becomes one of the SS, in an attempt to find a most secret and dangerous weapon that could indeed destroy the U.S. While taking on his role, he finds confidence in Kurt Daluege, discovering him to be a Christian in a most hostile environment. Shaw seeks nothing more than revenge against the despicable SS, yet comes to the realization that revenge belongs to our Father in Heaven.<br /><br /> Prepare to meet the likes of Winston Churchill. Or maybe even feel what it is like for Heinrich Himmler to be under the likes of the icy darkness of Fuhrer Adolf Hitler.

To think that one could come up with something as genius as this, it blows one's mind! We find letters from the enemy, preferably Screwtape advising Wormwood, and we find caution in how to arm ourselves against the forces of Hell.<br /><br />While a wonderful addition to my library, I found it interesting that Lewis showed Screwtape as a discourager, rather than an encourager, which is not unlike the devil. He gave advice, yet always found a way to put Wormwood down, rather than lift him up.<br /><br />He hit the nail on the head once again. A well full of wisdom! Good stuff!	2004-07-25

I'll be the first one to say that this is an awesome work by Dobson. We do not have to put up with the lies that say homosexuals were &quot;born that way.&quot; No. Nuh-uh, it ain't happening. As for me and my house, we will serve The Lord!<br /><br /> Marriage was made for 1 man and 1 woman, end of discussion! Now, just because the Christians don't accept homosexuality, does not mean that we hate homosexuals. A lot of people would like you to think that the word Christian is synonymous with words such as hateful, or gay basher. Give me a break! You are only such a thing if you choose to hate and bash people. James Dobson writes this book in love, and that is something that we need to make clear. Is this book one sided? Yes, it is, and it is the only side!! If you happen to be for gay marriage, you're on the wrong side, because the fact of the matter is, you'll lose. You may not lose today, you may not lose tomorrow, but in the end, you will lose, and I don't want to be on the wrong side, because when it comes right down to it, it is wrong!<br /><br /> Now, to set the record straight, I'm not a bigot, and I don't hate gay people. I love them, and I pray for their salvation through Jesus Christ. But I don't have to take the lies, and I certainly don't accept them!! God will not accept the lie, &quot;I was born that way.&quot; Don't think so, people. So, don't try it. He isn't fooled.<br /><br /> One more thing. This is to the people who think that homosexuals deserve the same rights as black people or minorities. Homosexuals are not a minority, and I'm not sorry to say that. OK? I know of people who used to be gay and turned straight. I don't know anyone who &quot;used to be&quot; black, Asian, or Hispanic and then turned white! And Michael Jackson does not count. Surgery can do anything. Have a nice day!!	2004-07-21

Of course, it involves nukes!! You once again see this from all sides of the battle field, and it makes you want more! I liked how they have General Grisham back in this one, and Bruno Macklin as well.<br /><br /> In this there is a message of keeping the faith. An awesome, as well as an entertaining novel with a lot of faith. While it isn't always easy to keep the faith, North keeps the pages turning with a little blood and guts to make it very interesting!

The one boy doesn't have the training as the other does, although he's giving it everything he has. He's pretty much throwing every bit of technique at the advanced student as he can, and yet he still continues to get beat. The teacher finally pulls the less of the 2 students off to the the sides and says, &quot;I know that you are as tough as nails. I know what you know. Perhaps if you went back to the basics, it might not be so difficult.&quot; The boys line up and square off. They circle each other. The lesser student finds his opening, BOOM!!! The other kid is sprawled out on the mat.<br />C.S. Lewis takes us through the basic points, and BOOM!! He floors us with what we thought was just going to be, &quot;Mere Christianity.&quot; He wrote this back in the 1940's, yet he used a language that we can all understand, yet you have to take the time to comprehend what he's saying. I looked at this as a complex book on simple issues, and it constantly hit me between the eyes! There are places where you see God in a whole new light. It is like you've never seen it in such a perspective, yet now you find yourself amazed. His illustrations are very simple, yet sometimes you might want to read it again to get the full understanding of what he is saying. Then read it again, and smile, and praise God for this wonderful work! People have labeled this as &quot;The most important book next to the Word of God.&quot; It just might be. And it is just the beginning.<br />C.S. Lewis used to be an atheist, and when he gave his talent to God, he became one of the most influencial writers that Christianity has ever seen! Folks, this is what happens when people might say, &quot;God can't use that.&quot; And then God looks at what appears to be impossible and says, &quot;Let's see what I can do!&quot; Did people back then think that a former atheist could pull something like this off?

This is a classic tale for anyone who has ever loved dogs, or, to be more specific, any particular dog. I can say that this is also an icy tale that will actually take your breath away as Paulsen describes some of the conditions he's been in with his sled dogs. This is the true story of how he survives in the Minnesota wilderness, and then takes on the bigtime, The Iditarod in Alaska!<br />When you read this, there are times when you will probably feel different things. Like the feeling some people have had (I have personally) of losing a pet. Or at times, you laugh at the hilarity of some of the things that pets will indeed do that leave you laughing so hard that it almost brings you to tears. Paulsen brings this to life only in the way that he has always used to tell a story. I love it how he describes his, and every man's greatest fear when in The Iditarod, is to scratch. When Paulsen describes this, he compares it to being a leper! He loves his dogs, and talks about how they are practically insane to run. He slightly haunts us with stories of hallucinations as a result of sleep deprivation! Yet, he also describes his most human side throughout the race, describing a cup of hot chocolate given to him by a beautiful blonde. Or how children from the Shageluk school made a pot of Moose chili especially for the mushers, and how he ate 19 bowls because it tasted so great, and then suffered the wonderful indigestion as a result. It is those stories and more, that make this an easy classic, and a read that you find hard to put down!<br />I first read this about 10 years ago. It still is easy to pick up, and enjoy it from page 1. Awesome work!	2004-07-14

But unlike Frank Perett or Parker Hudson, Vernon Buford tackles a subject in spiritual warfare that I've never seen, Legion. They are many, yet they are one. This reveals some heart pounding suspense that will hit many between the eyes. Crisp words combine with fresh hope, and a Savior who we can trust and have faith in when things sometimes go so wrong! But then again, Jesus is there in the good times and the bad, amen?<br />Vernon Buford. Who can forget a name like that? It is a name, that I hope won't go away quietly.

And he leads an unusual life in Pico Mundo, California. This was my first Dean Koontz, and it is for sure off the beaten path of what I'd normally read. I wasn't so sure at first, yet I loved it! It lifts your spirits, yet it kills you. No perfect ending, and that's what made it all the more easy to say, &quot;It is just a novel&quot;, yet in a sense, it is life. And you can sit back and just say, &quot;WOW!!&quot;<br />Odd sees dead people, but sometimes, he does something about it, and does it well. He is also an excellent fry cook. If you ever happen to be in a restaurant and hear, &quot;Two cows, make 'em cry, give 'em blankets, and mate 'em with pigs,&quot; that'll mean 2 hamburgers with onions, bacon and cheese! Hilarious! But along with the humor, you see a humble, yet zealous side of Odd. And, other than his day job, Odd hangs out with the king, Elvis! The chief of police relies on him sometimes. With friends like Little Ozzie, a rather big dude with six fingers on one hand, and a soul mate like Stormy Llewellen, Odd goes through life and does his thing. He feels it is destiny to be with Stormy forever. Little Ozzie is often challenging Odd with quotes, keeping the mind fresh at all times. But, you can't help but feel sorry for the poor cow! (You have to read it to find out!)<br />But there is something very evil going on. What is Odd Thomas to do to stop it? What is it? What will happen? Odd knows it can't be good, but what it is, he can't be certain. Is it just him, or will something terrible strike the simple little town of Pico Mundo?<br />This was a heart pounding suspense story about life and love! Very chilling, yet thrilling. BRR! Good chills! I just sometimes wonder why I hesitated to check out Mr. Koontz sooner! Can't wait to read more.	2004-07-02

It also is the end of the story for one Wade Bennett. It appears to be a suicide, and the case looks to be closing fast. Although you can see that it was his first book, he had a good rhythm going from the beginning.<br />Now, while there is no Mark Taylor, there is Rick Treadway, and those who have read &quot;Circle&quot; and &quot;Interview&quot; prior to this will recognize his name. Like I said above, I made the mistake of reading the other 2 prior to this one. Well paced, well thought out, one I think that any fan of Clay Jacobsen will most certainly appreciate.<br />One thing that was interesting enough was the lesson in this book itself. It was how Rick made a concrete commitment with Jesus, and his understanding the church as one. This is not only a good thriller, but a book for some who might have said, &quot;That's the Pastor's job.&quot; It gives a good message that we are all called to minister. Good job, Clay!	2004-06-29

This is just great humor and great insight from an awesome comedian. He most certainly delivers the hilarity, but there are a few somber times in the book where he is real, very real and takes a serious approach. He speaks highly of his dad, which I respect for 2 reasons. For one, if you have an awesome dad, like I do, and Sinbad does, you should express it. The second reason is because like myself, his dad is a preacher, and wanted nothing but the best for his boy.<br />I guess I would suggest to read the book, not buy it on audio, because the person doing that might expect a stand-up comedy performance, and that isn't what this is about. With that said, however, it is very funny most of the time with the Sinbad humor that people all across the country have grown to love! If you love Sinbad, you'll love reading his book. He also teaches us lessons throughout the book about not taking ourselves too seriously. Have some fun while reading this book!	2004-06-26

With 2 down and 1 to go, man, Ted Dekker leaves the reader in suspense! Thomas Hunter continues his quest along with Monique to eliminate the Raison Strain. Dekker writes at a panic driven speed, along with a sense of urgency, and then leaves the reader saying something like, &quot;WHOA!&quot; and it just keeps getting faster!<br />In this book, you will finally understand the meaning of the circle. In this book, you will understand what The Great Romance really means. And yes, you will know what Red means. The question is, are you ready for it?<br />Ted Dekker is Red hot right now, and after watching some counter punching a little with Black, I'm ready for the knock out punch that'll floor us all! There was a lot more detail in this, that was what I really liked. Black was awesome, but left you ultimately wanting more. Well, he gives you more with Red, saying, &quot;Oh yeah!!&quot; White indeed will be something to buckle your seatbelt for, because this time he ain't stopping until the ride is over!

Well, this was my first Burke book, and to say the least, it probably won't be my last. I was introduced to Detective Dave Robicheaux for the first time, and I enjoyed it. In this mystery you find that the question is about Aaron Crown, and why so many people want him dead. Join Dave as well as Clete Purcel as he squares off with Budford and Karen LaRose, tries to find out information about Mookie Zerrang!<br />So sit back, relax and enjoy some crawfish and something cold to drink along with this book as you read some swampy Cajun action all around the bayou!

I can say immediately that I have been both Hem and Haw. When life throws you a change, you have to deal with it, or it will control you, and you will get NO PLACE AT ALL!!! This is a tough lesson to learn. We want what is ours, and instead of looking for a new opportunity, we pout, like Hem. Unlike Haw, who was able to get something out of what they had gotten themselves into. He laughed at his past, and although for awhile he wasn't finding any cheese, it was a heck of a lot better then sitting on his can doing nothing!<br />Now, for all you Hems out there who &quot;didn't get anything out of this and are still wondering what the point is....&quot; Why don't you actually try reading the book?! It helps to actually try and get something out of it, not just look at the cover and say like Hem would say, &quot;But... But... But...&quot; C'mon! Get your feelings off of your sleeves! Get the chip off of your shoulder. It helps. Really, it does. Out with the old, in with the new. The Sniffs and Scurrys out there have already read this book and are rolling right along with the punches, keeping their running shoes around their necks, just in case.<br />Change does happen, people.

There were parts where I felt he dragged it out a little too much, but it still kept the pages turning, so for the most part, it was interesting. I didn't feel like putting it down, that's for sure!<br />Join Mike Bryant as he goes for a record attempt, to dive Cenote X (pronounced seh-NO-tay as described in chapter) after a first attempt ends in tragedy for his friend, Pete. I thought it was interesting how a deaf woman came into play throughout the story. Mike wants to make it to the bottom of Cenote X, and Bridget (his deaf girlfriend) has a 2nd opinion. I think it is interesting how Bridget is a doctor in this as well. In the midst of all this, a man named Viktor Bellum has his own ideas, what they are, nobody knows. The person who stands out in this book is probably Elvis Hastings, surfer dude turned missionary, who has a lot of deep thought for Mike, who only wishes he had the kind of faith that Elvis has. It is very thought provoking about how we might witness to someone, when you see Elvis take something that Mike might say and turn it into his own illustration. It is awesome that Elvis is a missionary to the Mayan people and how he already uses sign language somewhat as a means of communicating.<br />This is a book of faith, adventure, and a search for something in the depths of Cenote X, what the Mayans call, K'uxulch'en, in their own language it means, &quot;The Well of Sorrows.&quot; For the most part, it was awesome, but it probably could have been shortened. Other than that, I hope to see more of Tom Morrisey in the future. This is good stuff!	2004-06-07

I loved reading this book, everything that the movie left out. You read this through the eyes of Ponyboy Curtis, and you learn what it is like to live life on the other side of the tracks, as greasers. You also feel a contempt for the socs, but also somewhat of a self pity for them as well. You read this and you understand his life, along with his brothers, Darrell and Soda-pop. This book also gave a more accurate description of Dallas Winston, and Two-bit than what the movie portrayed. You cherish the way Johnny is viewed in this book by the others in the gang.<br />It is probably easy for people to believe, but my favorite chapter where the rumble occurs. It gives a lot more detail, and you can feel every punch, every kick and every throw delivered in this work of art.<br />The movie was well made, will never exceed the quality of this awesome work. I could read this over and over and never get sick of it! It doesn't get much better when it comes to fiction like this.	2004-06-06

While I will check out more of David Morrell, I didn't look at this as a novel of survival, but of hell on wheels revenge, and with no consequences. The setting in France was awesome. Takes you to a different place in the world. I thought it was a good attempt of a &quot;kill or be killed&quot; kind of book, but after awhile, I just didn't see it in that light at all.<br />So, in closing I can say that I'll give Morrell another shot. I loved the Rambo movies and would love the chance to read &quot;First Blood&quot; or something that will stick out so I can further read his material. In saying that, the Rambo movies were also movies motivated by revenge, but it wasn't the point Morrell was trying to get across.<br />It was hard for me to give this only 3 stars. But as a man who makes up his mind and sticks to his guns, that's all I can give it. Maybe next time.	2004-05-31

If Randy Singer were a baseball, with all his twists and turns, and then a top notch fastball to boot, we'd be calling him Randy Johnson! I almost had to take a shower after this book, I was sweating so bad! And John Grisham needs to give Mr. Singer a call on writing tips, because Singer makes Grisham look like an amateur, and I really like Grisham. But there's a new kid in town, and that's who I'm reading!<br />Join Mitchell Taylor as he takes the case of Maryna Sareth. Maryna is running from the Snakeheads, Chinese gangsters, and so much more. You also get the feeling that she is indeed searching for something, being raised as a Buddhist. There are a lot of heart pounding twists in this case that literally make you sweat. In some places you actually feel for Cameron when you realize that she never had much of a relationship with her father, better known as The Rock. You feel for her in wondering if things between them will ever be resolved. Judge Baker-Kline, better known as Ichabod returns in this first class thriller to liven up the action.<br />All I can say is that if you have yet to read Randy Singer, you are missing quite a treat. Awesome! When you read him, you are reading more than simply a court case, or whatever it may be. He goes much deeper than that, and that is what I personally love about this author. He's one of my top 3 favorites to read!	2004-05-27

The action in this doesn't stop, folks.<br /> Join Charles Arnold, attorney at law, slash, preacher as he takes the side of Thomas and Theresa Hammond to fight for their rights as parents. When they are faced with tragedy, Arnold steps in to face Rebecca Crawford, A.K.A. the Barracuda.<br />I love Randy Singer. I love the way he mixes humor that you might slightly compare with Jefferson Scott, and he comes at you 80 miles per hour, and doesn't bother stopping, just makes you sweat a little bit more.<br />I thought that it was something you don't see every day in the case of Buster Jackson. Buster makes a statement that can make everyone who is a Christian think when he said, \\"Christians don't return hate for hate.\\" That choked me up. Picture Michael Clarke Duncan as Buster, and possibly David Chappelle as Charles. This could be best described as a story of forgiveness, piety, but also very much a story of redemption. In saying that, I am in the middle of Irreparable Harm by Mr. Singer. We want more! Can't get enough of this man!<br />This man should be as popular as courtroom authors such as Steve Martini and John Grisham. I say that because he's better than they are! OH YEAH!!

But if you want someone to get into your series, make it interesting, starting with the first book. I can most honestly say that I wanted to get into this. You look at the cover and it really looks intriguing and like a page turner. But to be blunt, except for a few parts, it is BORING, and Left Behind is still better! The difference is that Left Behind just gets into it. This looks as if it has trouble making up its mind.<br />Now, I read the whole thing, but I wasn't impressed, and despite myself, I got Exodus, which I will read at some point in time. But if it doesn't get any better, then I'm not wasting my time. I respect the effort and the intentions, but at least make it interesting.	2004-05-23

I remember getting this when I was a teen and I laughed the whole way through. There's no plot here, people, just lots of uses for dead cats, and that is saying a lot, seeing as how I love cats!!<br />How'd you like to use a dead cat for a baseball bat? How about a beer tap? How about a dead cat frisbee? How about a cat pencil sharpener. Yep, I read this book, and I thought it was hilarious. I guess you could say that if you are sensitive to cat jokes, don't dare get or even peek at this book! This just goes along with my somewhat warped sense of humor!	2004-05-23

This is his first published work, and leaves his readers breathless! He weaves a story of forgiveness, faith, action, along with some really good suspense. It has some really good twists in it. Join Josee Walker as her and her father team up to search for her mother, and so much more.<br />I loved the characters. I also liked the idea of his titling the chapters. When it came to that, they not only got your attention, but sometimes had an icy bite to them. I say icy as in cool and awesome, you don't want to miss anything! Chapters such as \\"Deadline\\" or \\"No Rest For the Wicked\\" or something such as \\"Games of Chance\\" or something haunting like \\"Sorceress\\" and when I say that, I give nothing away. Awesome chapter titles for an excellent read. And what a title for a book! Whew! Looks deep? Just wait until you read it!<br />You'll note that I said that this is a book of action, along with other words. Action has many meanings. As a Christian, the biggest action we can use is our faith, which Eric showed throughout this book. I can say already that we can put Eric up there with Ted Dekker and Randy Singer. One thing that I should add. Once you get into this book, and it is very easy to do so, you will probably think of this as a chess match. Pawn here, bishop there. Just kind of an afterthought. Awesome and unforgettable!	2004-05-19

I got it back when I was 19, probably just so I could read about some good fights. But it had so much more. Like how George was a fighter as a kid. He talked about how he played high school football and the coach who carried around the wooden paddle! I thought it was neat the way he talked about his experience in the Job Corps. Even then he struggled with his temper, and talked about how there was one special lady who always loved him. The cafeteria lady, Mrs. Moon, who eventually invited him over for dinner.<br />I loved the way he described his fights, some of them in awesome detail. He still recalls losing 2 fights against a man named Clay Hodges, but then going to the Olympics and winning the gold against Russian, Ionas Chepulis. He vividly tells about what he was thinking in his first fight with Smokin' Joe Frazier. He tells about fighting Ken Norton. I admire the fact that George takes the good with the bad, and talks about his defeat to Muhammed Ali.<br />But the most awesome thing is about how George became a pastor. He truly is an amazing man, with the grace of God. This shows the awesome power of an awesome man, led now by an awesome God!	2004-05-15

To start out, this was my first work by Jim Cymbala. Now I want EVERYTHING he wrote! I really didn't know what to think when I first received this book to read for my own application. While the title may look simplistic, look beyond that. This dives straight into the heart of prayer and faith! Stories from people such as Nicky Cruz, a man who was raised as a devout Hindu and came to know Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior. It also had the story of Lynette Mohammed who relied on the joy of the Lord through 9/11. Jim had a chapter on why we shouldn't fear. Awesome. The biblical examples in this book are just witnesses that can reach anyone! Examples of King David, Moses, Solomon, the apostle Paul and even one of my favorite verses out of the book of Habakkuk. This book taught me a lot about myself, and it gave new meaning to praying. It even taught me a little bit about what I need, patience! To wait on God sometimes. To rely on God's joy to be our strength, not ours!<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their walk with God, and so much more! This book is called Breakthrough Prayer. Read it and find out why.	2004-05-15

You walk into your local Christian book store, and you see a cover such as this, with a title such as this, and you're thinking, &quot;This is Christian?&quot; OH YEAH! Brouwer introduces us to Nick Barrett in the first person, who, by the way, has only one leg, as the result of a car accident. But he travels back to Charlestown embittered by the past, but, when someone else pays for the plane ticket, you make exceptions, right? The fact of the matter is this: Nick is looking for answers. And to do that, he has to face some of his past. It isn't always easy. In fact, you might say that it could get downright dangerous and somebody could get killed!<br />This was my first Brouwer book, and until you take the time to read it through, only then will you realize what the title, &quot;Out of the Shadows&quot; really means to Nick Barrett, and it nearly brings you to tears. A classic mystery where what you see isn't always what you think it may be. Brouwer shows a good Christian witness in this, and that makes it very much worth the reader's time. I'm glad I took my time with this one. Very well worth it! No regrets.	2004-05-09

If you are looking for a tale of other worlds full of adventure, then this is for you. But if you are looking for that and more, than read deeper than just the stories. And then this is also for you. When it comes down to it, you could just say that it's simply about a few kids who discover a land call Narnia and hang out with the Creator of it all, Aslan. Yes, and what a wonderful illustration of it all. That can't be beat! I could go on and tell about each and every book, one by one, but I won't do that, because it defeats the purpose of writing a review for me on a whole box set. What I will do is tell my favorites, and the ones that meant the most to me. My favorites are \\"The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe\\" (naturally) and \\"Prince Caspian\\".<br />But it goes way beyond that. The 2 that mean the most to me happen to be \\"The Voyage of The Dawn Treader\\" and \\"The Last Battle\\". Dawn Treader, to me is a story of change. When Eustace is turned into an ugly, hideous dragon, then Aslan comes into the night and he is once again Eustace, and we see a totally different Eustace, not the arrogant, self absorbing Eustace we see at the beginning. And of course, that's only part of the story, but my favorite part, an awesome illustration. The Last Battle is an incredible statement the whole way through. Now, yeah, it is about this stupid ape who sees a lion skin and tries to play Aslan, which does illustrate how we as Christians exercise our free will all too frequently and try to play God with our own lives. But, of course the monkey takes it a lot further, etc. Some might say that it is the end of the books. Yes and no. But wait! It is the end that hits me, and even Rick Warren uses it in his book, \\"The Purpose Driven Life\\", when he quotes Lewis at the end with this about the children who experienced Narnia with this quote. \\"For us this is the end of the stories....But for them it was only the beginning of the real story. All their life in this world had been the cover and the title page: now at last they were beginning Chapter One of the Great Story, which no one on Earth has read, which goes on forever and in which every chapter is better than the one before.\\" How true for each and every one of us.

When I first heard of Hudson, it was played out like he'd be the next Frank Peretti. Not so, but he is good. This book was very simplistic and at times, extremely repetitive, which made it very difficult to keep the pages turning. I had to force myself to read a lot of it. For instance, Richard and Kristin having &quot;lunch&quot; together. The first time it got my attention, the second time, ok, the third time, let's see something new, please! That got old. The Tommy story in part 1 was pretty much the same old story. Unfortunately, that as well, got very, very old, even if new stuff was added here and there.<br />But, I know when I read a book, that Mr. Hudson wrote this from the heart. He cares about people. He cares about saving souls. He cares about seeing people come to know Jesus Christ! That is a big step to making an awesome career to writing better stuff in the future. The part about the demons were where Hudson was able to break some ground. What I wished for more of were the personalized angels as well as the demons. You see that in Peretti's &quot;Darkness&quot; books with angels such as Guilo, Tal, such as that who are ready to fight for you with almost an intensity that you feel, not just perched on a restaurant building and choking the life out of a demon. Now, it may be a little unfair of me to compare Hudson with an author such as Frank Peretti, but when you think of spiritual warfare, Peretti's the first name that comes to mind.<br />This probably won't be my most popular review to date, but if I weren't being honest, I'd be just as bad as an enemy because Ephesians says to speak the truth in love, as I've attempted to do without cutting into Mr. Hudson. I just hope I don't sound like Publisher's Weekly sounds at times where they don't even read half the book, and still bash it! I gave this a fair chance, and Hudson does have potential. I most certainly WILL read more of his stuff. You don't get rid of me that easily! But I do thank Parker Hudson for a sincere writing, straight from the heart.n for a sincere writing, straight from the heart.	2004-05-04

Please tell me this wasn't the last Firebrand book! Incredible 3 books!<br />In this one, Scott throws a big league hook at you by switching the narration between 2 people, himself and a lady named who is pregnant named Chun-Mi, and he succeeds! In this book, surprise! Jason Kromer is engaged! And to whom, might you ask? Well, the one and only Trieu Nguyen! Eloise sends them this time to Korea, possiby their most dangerous mission yet. Out of all the Firebrand books, this one touched my heart and I'll tell you why. It had to do with how Garth got so attached to little Ki-Won. How Lewis, who couldn't stand to see a little guy suffer, even over puzzle shapes, made him new ones, and how Ki-won fell in love with his new buddies. I think if I were in Garth's situation I would at some point in time feel the rage like he did when Ki-Won was kidnapped and there seemed to be nothing he could do about it. I also was moved by Chris in this by his adoration of Myong-Chol, the former prison guard. I'm pretty sure that in the last Firebrand, Veggie Tales were used to identify one another. This one used Lord of the Rings. Chimp was Gandalf and one person, whom you'll have to read the book to find out, referred to herself as the White Lady. And Mr. Scott, if you think I wasn't paying attention, I did notice the title of chapter 20, 'You Shall Not Pass': BRILLIANT! This is typical Jefferson Scott humor in this series, and it is what I've personally come to love about them. That and the way that the team depends on God. This is a series that hits you in the chest and even possibly makes you a little more human.<br />Now that this series is over, I've gotta find Jefferson Scott's other books! And I will find them!	2004-04-24

But Bob Larson clearly states afterwards, that it is based on true facts. I would most definately consider this a mature book. DO NOT PICK THIS UP UNLESS YOU ARE READY FOR COLD HARD FACTS! Facts about the occult and what they will do for Satan and for power. The detail in &quot;Dead Air&quot; are are very graphic very gruesome, and yes, very disturbing. The sad thing is, it happens. If Bob Larson just made this up, he's a sick man, but I've heard his radio show, and when he was on TV, I watched his show, and he isn't making this stuff up. If you read this, be ready for a dose of reality.<br />Make no mistake about it, there is an enemy out there, and his name is Satan. But there also is someone out there, who died for us, and is reaching out to us to save us from the enemy. That someone is Jesus, and he's stronger than anything that the devil can throw at you. With Jesus, that sucker can't touch you!<br />As a dad with a 2 month old daughter, this book was indeed very sobering.<br /><br />Many people don't agree with everything Bob Larson says. I don't agree with all his views. But this is right on! And it shouldn't be ignored, for those who have the stomach for it. If you don't have the stomach, call on Jesus! Some will pass this off as nothing more than a sick horror novel. But it is much more than that. It is a wake up call!	2004-04-13

Instantly you find yourself pulling for Angus MacCameron, and more importantly, the truth! Will Chambers has the attitude that gives you the will to smile at times, and then there's times where I couldn't help but feel sorry for him. But you can see the wheels turning through his head as well. This is the first of a 4 book series, so I'll certainly be reading more of Mr. Parshall in the future!<br />Angus MacCameron is being sued for defamation of character of a well respected professor, and he turns to Will Chambers, an alcoholic lawyer for help. I like how early on, Angus compares the Christian walk as to a coliseum, \\"Will you be standing with the Christians, down in the blood and sand, when the lions come charging-or will you be with the pagans, cheering up in the stands?\\" I can easily see Sean Connery playing an Angus MacCameron.<br />That poses an awesome question that each of us have to answer one day. This was more than just a courtroom thriller, it was more than a mystery. Well worth the read!	2004-04-05

I thought this was very thought provoking. It's great work by one of the greatest authors of all time. I think everyone should take the time to read at least one of C.S. Lewis's works. If you've read the Narnia series, you find a similarity where Lewis takes Dr. Ransom and his companions (2 to be exact) and takes them to a whole new world. That's where the imagination kicks in and C.S. Lewis takes you for a ride! It is always a treat to read any work by this man! Kudos!	2004-03-14

This book is a masterpiece, in my personal opinion. I had a lot of fun with it, and therefore finished it rather quickly. I find it hilarious that amazon has become the bashing ground for this book by wannabe evolutionists! Some people are actually crazy enough to think that Mr. Bell has gone to lengths to \\"punish those darn evolutionists\\", but do you really think that is the case? Nah! This book just upsets or encourages people, and then they have to take the necessary pot shots so their feelings won't stay hurt.<br />I really had a ball reading this as a satire, but then again as an encouragement. It takes guts to do something like this, and James Scott Bell has done this, and he even shows it when he says at the end that he was going to publish this book himself, but then a publisher saw it and said, 'Let us publish it.' Of course, some would blame that on a supernatural coincidence, but us Christians might say something like, \\"To God be the glory, He is an awesome God who does great and mighty things!!\\" This book is a great and mighty thing. And as we see in the review section of amazon, some people get highly and mightily ticked off...<br />GROW UP!!! You either read the book and get something out of it, or you read it and get mad about it. Either way, this is a book that will be read and be argued over for awhile, and I'm pretty sure that it won't just go away. Just so certain people out there aren't too disappointed.<br />Thank you, Mr Bell, and good day!	2004-03-10

I have to say that this book took me a little longer than it normally would take me. But that's the good thing about this book. If you take the time to absorb the message, it will be more than worth your valued time.<br /><br />I was taken on a journey through the eyes of journalist, Jake Woods, who investigates the death of his two friends. It describes the relationship between Finney, who cares enough about his friends to correct them and try to guide them in the right direction, and then there's Doc, who only cares about himself and lives for himself. Jake has to decide what is real for him, and he has to go through some trial in his life to do this. I think it's awesome how Alcorn describes that in Heaven there's always someone watching out for you and someone who desires to fight for you at your greatest moment of need, at least that's what I got out of this. He gives an awesome reality of our Heavenly Father, and also leaves the reader with a desire to live for God.<br /><br />Deadline is a great book with some really powerful twists. One other person said that if you can just take your time through this book, it is well worth it. That is so true, and I'm looking forward to reading Randy Alcorn in the future!	2004-03-08

There were times in this book where I look back at my own life and feel like Caleb. But all in all this was an awesome read and I was once again enlightened by Ted Dekker. I found myself tearing through this book, just like any other Dekker work! Ted Dekker never ceases to amaze me. Good stuff!<br />It seems like Dekker and Bright hit you with a big league curve in certain places, and just when you thought you couldn't be taken any further out of your comfort zone, BOOM! And I love it! Have fun with this one. I think it is fair to say that if you haven't at least tried Dekker's work, you are truly missing out on a treat. That is how good he is!	2004-03-06

Join Thomas Hunter and his quest to save the world while trying to stop an evil that is unimaginable. Without giving anything at all away, this is a fantasy book, yet without witches and elves, etc. But on the other hand, look at it as an end times project. I can't wait for Red!

And it has everything! Action, suspense, romance, all wrapped up with the peace that passes all understanding, Jesus Christ. I rank this book right up there on the level as W.G. Griffiths, &quot;Malchus&quot; because it just had that kind of impact. I finished it, I can't wait to read &quot;Avenger of Blood&quot;, but it gives you hope in times of trouble. This is supposed to be a 7 book series and I just can't wait for them to start coming hot off the press! This book also asks the question concerning how committed to Christ we really are. Are we going to fear the worst, or are we going to trust in Him and press on? It takes a look at whether the reader might be caught up in worldly things? It takes a sharp look at betrayal. Are you going to confess your relationship to Him before men, or will we be ashamed? When you finish this book, it should be with a renewed strength with the power to say, &quot;I don't care WHAT the circumstances or the consequences, I belong to Jesus Christ, and nobody can take that away from me!!&quot;<br />Pastor John Hagee, thank you!

Bayer hits an issue at hand that many people, Christians or not, need to address, the issue of hatred. Satan's Ring does that, and at the same time makes no apologies. This guy has guts for standing up for such a sensitive matter that is not just nation-wide, but world wide! And I just find it unbelievable that Publisher's Weekly and Booklist actually read this and put thought into it. I think that both of them sit in a little room once a week, drinking coffee and saying, \\"Hey, look at this. Let's bash this person!\\" I really do, because if they put some thought in what they read in this book, they'd see merely past the title.<br />It starts right off where 3 hispanics are murdered on a back country road, and at the same time, the governor's car is attacked. Behind it is a hate group called The Brotherhood of The Ring. The leader is known only as The Shepherd. Bring in Andrew Chapman. The thing about Andrew is that he used to be a member of the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood is against all minorities and wants to eliminate all of them in what they call Operation Resurrection. It also seems as if power from this group comes from power in high places. In the midst of it all though, is a prayer warrior who is known for her long lists of who to pray for. This is a novel about Christianity, Satanism, love, hatred, bigotry, betrayal and sometimes you wonder who you can trust! I can almost compare this to Ted Dekker's one and only masterpiece, \\"THR3E\\", and for that reason alone I give it the 5 stars, because it deserves more. As for John F. Bayer, he deserves more respect than PW and Booklist give him. Booklist had the nerve to actually say, \\"Unfortunately, the supremacists are merely stock villains, and one does not learn a great deal about them.\\" Please read the book, then write your review. I did, and it gave me something to keep on my bookshelf. This book also shows the power of an awesome God. He isn't always going to put people in the comfortable situation. But with that in mind,  He also puts ordinary people in extraordinary situations and then you see the awesome power of our loving Father! This is that kind of book. There are times where nothing is what it may seem. That's where trust in God comes into play. I think you have to trust in God to write something like this and then get it published. John F. bayer did that, he did it with success, and nobody can tell him any different without looking like PW or Booklist.<br />Awesome work!!with that in mind,  He also puts ordinary people in extraordinary situations and then you see the awesome power of our loving Father!

Once again he provides an awesome wit, along with sometimes a strange sense of humor that I appreciate. And he once again shows how a member or two might show some weaknesses. You might also want to look for hints of Veggie Tales in this thriller.<br />Eloise sends the team to Sudan, where the Firebrand team looks to free women and children who are slaves. Jason deals with the subject of revenge and also how to respond to certain situations like a true leader. You also find Rachel wishing to seek retribution in certain places of this book. Garth and Lewis never fail to crack me up throughout the book, and Lewis brings along his friend, Chunky. It also has a beautiful Christian witness through everything the team encounters. This book has some awesome action the whole way through the book. It also deals immensely with grace and mercy and forgiveness. I  can't wait for the next book in this series!

If you can imagine traveling to your ultimate fantasy and having it turn into the ultimate nightmare, then take a deep breath and read Crossfire.<br />Sarah marries Nicholas and travels to Bolivia in hope of the perfect life. Nicholas's family, the Cortezes' have wealth that most americans wouldn't believe, courtesy of the family business that provides a life without limits. Encounters with the DEA lead to questions and Sara asks herself if everything is actually what it seems. Many times this book asks the question concerning where God is during the rough times? Has He left us? Has He turned his back on us? When you read this book, you'll see our Heavenly Father in a whole new light, and you will ultimately know that he never left us for one second! That's what makes this more than a mere 5 star book. Jeanette Windle is right up there with Ted Dekker, Frank Peretti and Robert Whitlow! Oh yeah!	2004-01-18

Have you ever looked at a book, and thought that just because the book looked a little weak, therefore it MUST be weak? I wasn't sure what to think, but I didn't know what was coming were some of the most powerful pages that Ted Dekker wrote while teamed up with Bill Bright. I was really moved by the faith of little Caleb. It also moved me with the story of Jason, and then Leiah, who appears to be scarred for life. This isn't just an action packed thriller, (although it is very much so) but it is a testimony of God's love.<br />  If someone gives you the chance to read this book, along with, &quot;A Man Called Blessed&quot;, read them. What an awesome witness! Sometimes we don't know what something like this will hold in its pages, but then you read it, and all of a sudden you find yourself not wanting to put it down!

I was anxiously awaiting this book, and then I found out it was for teens... YUCK! The book buyer in the store stopped me and said, \\"Wolfe, we've had adults who said this book scared the pants off of them!\\" So you take a look at the cover. Interesting. Then you get into the book. Oh yeah!<br />Meet the Springfield family and the twins, Elijah and Elisha, the whole family better known as The Veritas Project, veritas is latin for the word truth (which yes, I learned in the book, so I learned something new) and they help the FBI. In this book you enter a world of hate, fear, and rejection. This book came out after Peretti's touching, \\"The Wounded Spirit\\" and it is right on cue. This book at times scared the poo-poo out me and was a page turner. I can honestly say that it doesn't hold much of a candle to the \\"Darkness\\" books, but it is classic Peretti, and it is certainly a 5 star book. Why do I say this? Because the darkness books were primarily spiritual warfare, while this book centered around bullying. There was one part in the book that deals with spiders and I was wrestling with myself whether or not to turn the page! This is what makes Peretti a master of an author, and that is why he is one of my favorite authors!	2003-12-31

This was hilarious in spots where you shouldn't even be MAKING jokes, but they still came off as funny and at times I'd sit there and say aloud, &quot;GEEZ!&quot; and almost start rolling on the floor! I have to say one thing... Tim Downs should have started writing fiction a long time ago, because this book was long overdue! This book was fun, funny, sarcastic, suspensful and just plain enjoyable.<br />Dr. Nick Polchak, (almost sounds like pole cat!) is the bug man! Or, to be literally correct like Nick would be, he is a forensic entomologist, an investigator who studies dead bodies after the bugs start to get to inhabit the body. Here he investigates an apparent suicide. Kathryn Guilford, friend of the victim is not convinced that it is a suicide and feels that there are details being overlooked. The authorities declare it a suicide, but as Nick gets involved, things come to light slowly but surely. This book has a really good twist, with an even better plot. It also has a message in it, without being preachy.<br />But I'll say this. If you want something different, get this. It isn't just an interesting looking cover, it is a very entertaining read that keeps the pages turning!	2003-12-31

I'd waited and waited to read something by Bayer, but for some reason I wanted to start with his first, and if I liked it, then I'd check out more. I will certainly be checking out more of his stuff! Bayer packs an awesome plot into something huge that any action buff can appreciate. Take for example a little red car that is going about 110 and still in 2nd gear, just getting warmed up! That would be how I would rank John F. Bayer. He's just getting warmed up, folks!<br />This book centers around Navy Commander and Chaplain David Michaels who is looking into his brother's death. His brother worked at a plant in Arkansas. The more David looks into it, the more it looks like murder rather than the accident his brother's employers are making it out to be. This book asks the question, and will certainly be asking the reader, 'what do I really believe... and why?' I hope that there are people who come across John F. Bayer's name on websites like Christianbook.com like I did. Something about this book caught my attention like so many unknown authors do, and I took a shot at reading his first novel. Awesome! So, in closing, I will say that I praise God for finding me another example of something that amazed me.	2003-12-30

This was a good book, but after Frank Peretti, most other spiritual warfare books are only second best compared to him. But I liked the way it was written. This book, in my most humble opinion, shows how society can and will view us as Christians. Now, not everyone out there who isn't a Christian is going to judge, but there are people like the ones in this book in the world. All in all it is an excellent book, but until it matches up to Peretti's standards, it isn't getting my 5 stars. Awesome effort! I do hope to read more from this author.	2003-12-30

From the prologue to the very end, this was a book that I couldn't put down. Being a Christian, I found this thriller very inspirational, and that's what has kept me reading Robert Whitlow to this day.<br />It really pumped me up to read about a character such as Scott Ellis, who stands up for what he believes in immensely. When I first read about Tao Pang, I didn't realize what a role he would play in this book. I also found it fascinating how Scott was asked to be the head of a mock trial team at a local high school. This book is typical Whitlow where he gently weaved in and out and then exploded at the right moment. Great work!	2003-12-09

I read this book after I had read &quot;The Sacrifice.&quot; I knew this was his first book, and I would have thought that Whitlow has been doing this for years.<br />This book is about Renny Jacobsen, an attorney who is fresh out of law school. When his father dies, he leaves to Renny the rights to a list in South Carolina. It is a company that nobody has ever heard of and is very mysterious. It is obvious that this list is fueled by greed, but also an very intense evil. But Renny has something else on his side with Christians praying for him every step of the way. He meets Jo Berry, who happens to be a Christian too, and encourages Renny to not participate in this.<br />The List asks the reader a simple question. What do you get if you gain everything? A powerful read that I would encourage any Christian to read.	2003-12-09

Believe it or not, I thought this book was maybe 3 3/4 stars, but not four. In my opinion, Bunn fell short because I really didn't see much of a witness all in all for Jesus. When Bunn puts Jesus in light of everything, then he scores a 5, but this time, AH, not quite. I still enjoy Bunn's work.

That was definitely the case with this book. I was in the Christian Book store and I saw the cover. Immediately I thought it was a book about a fire man. Then I saw that it said, &quot;WAR IS HELL. That's why the world needs us.&quot; I thought, duh, and your point is, Mr. Scott? I walked away from the book, yet thinking about it the whole time. Needless to say, the next time I came upon it, it looked more interesting. So, when I got some money for my birthday, this book was one among four that I happened to purchase that day. I still wasn't expecting anything very impressive. I was so wrong, and I'm glad that God knows me better, a lot better than I know myself!<br />I found myself engulfed in the story. You can see that certain people have their weaknesses. Jason's reluctance to join the Firebrand team illustrates how we as Christians can sometimes question God and why He calls us to do certain things. One person who caught my eye was Lewis when he overcame his own fear in one part of the book. When I say that, I give nothing away. It is a witness to me how someone such as 'Chimp' could change as well, and be a witness and a leader at the same time in the middle of crisis.<br />This was a prime example of the old saying, &quot;You can't judge a book by it's cover.&quot; I thank God for once again opening my eyes.	2003-11-28

God loves us so much, and this is an awesome, thought provoking illustration of that love. This book is sometimes like a quick punch to the chest, and then at times it's a cool drink of water. It has that kind of action and then at times that kind of romance that perfects this book. I can understand why this is such a controversial book, but that's another reason that it makes it so good.

There are some issues that some people may not be comfortable with. But for those people, you have to see the whole picture, and you appreciate this book all the more. When I read about Mark trying to figure out what's just going on, the words came off the pages! Thank you, Clay! Bravo!	2003-10-27

It's not an autobiography, but then again, it is in a sense. It is a book of day by day devotionals by an awesome man who loves The Lord. Hey, he takes the approach from different experiences he has had. This was a very simple approach to a devotional, and that's what it was meant to be. What a pity that people still feel the need to bash this man. He deserves to be praised!<br />Reggie White, awesome book! Keep it up. He will certainly hear the words, &quot;Well done, good and faithful servant!&quot; Because in the midst of all the controversy, despite the petty name calling, Reggie White is on the right side! Preach it, brother!! I like that!!	2003-10-21

First of all, I'd like to thank Publishers Weekly for that overly constipated review of Mr. Dekker's work. They give Christians a bad name, and instead of acting like Christians, they really act like the Pharisees, so they should be quite proud of themselves! Let's give them a big hand, because we watch out for you all the time, and you really aren't that good at writing reviews anyway! And as for the readers on this site who didn't have any nerve to put their name, please get some guts and then write a real review. Now, on with MY review.<br />I think most readers (except for the ones mentioned above of course, ha ha) can imagine being such a person as Seth Border, and then running into someone like Miriam. This was not only an awesome read, but it really drove the point home! I couldn't read this book without giving God all the glory in the end! It is all about 2 people learning about each other and so much, much more. If you want a book that will not only give you an honest adventure, some unexpected twists, and an end that will make you say, &quot;Now I NEVER really imagined something like THAT happening, but it makes sense!&quot; If you want to say something like that, get this book. Because that's what I was saying after reading it. Why? Because that's how God works. You aren't supposed to expect everything that is coming. That's how this book is, and it was worth every cent! YEAH!!!	2003-10-19

This is a work of genius. Focus on The Family radio played Frank Abagnale's testimony, and it sounds almost unbelievable, but there's things in here that you can't talk about and just make up to talk about. I read the chapter about the French prison system. To just imagine the conditions of being confined like that, WHEW! The most accurate part in the movie had to be when he impersonated a doctor, and when it came down to it, went before a medical board, answered a few questions (which the movie didn't show), and became not only a pediatrician, but the head pediatrician down south in a hospital. Amazing book.	2003-10-08
US	30212713	R5G2LOUE51VES	0785277099	351376566	Leviathan	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Good, but predictable	I'll be reading more of Huggins, but this book was predictable in my opinion. Not much of a plot. Leviathan is loose! Kill Leviathan! And on the other hand, Leviathan kills everything in it's path until it is stopped. But on the other hand, I really liked who Jackson Conner was. This is a man who cares for his family and is willing to fight for them, even if to the death! Then you come to Thor! Oh, you've gotta love Thor! When Huggins describes his size, you figure he should naturally be with one of those wrestling places! Huge man with a mammoth battle axe, but a heart for the Lord. I find it interesting that Thor is the scholar in this book, but that's what makes it interesting. The one thing I did not know was that Leviathan is in The Bible in the book of Job. That was one thing that kept me reading, and although like I said it was predictable, it was a quick read. Keeps the pages turning, but was easy enough to figure out. But in closing, I'll say that I can't wait to read more of Mr. Huggins. Good work!	2003-10-08

Through the eyes of Malchus, a servant of Caiaphas, and a skeptic, he finds out for himself who Jesus truly is. This book will make you think. What are you willing to stand up for? At what cost? Awesome! Beautiful picture of what Christianity is and should be all about!	2003-10-08

I thought the ending was way off. The book was very well written, and after the ending, it still had me looking for much, much more. That doesn't just dismiss Bunn as a bad author. Read either &quot;Drummer in The Dark&quot; or &quot;The Great Divide&quot; and you'll find that he is a very seasoned author, he loves The Lord, and it shows in his work.	2003-09-28

With the 2 being in one, sometimes the arms get quite a workout, if you read it for too long! Frank Peretti is right up there with Ted Dekker. I've heard Frank speak, and he is one of a kind. If you are looking for an author who writes about spiritual warfare, just head for Peretti, because he is the best in the business! He will make you think about eternity in a whole new perspective. Frank isn't a new author, and he won't go away. He will be known as an inspiration for generations.<br />Join Tal and Guilo and other angels as they take on demons and the powers of darkness in the fight for souls!  Frank Peretti digs deep into the soul. He also shows a very human side of life, teaching you and making it quite interesting and at times humorous. He has to be one of the biggest experts on spiritual warfare. As I said above, if you don't believe that, listen to him. The man does his homework. Now, if this isn't telling you what you need to know, you need to get one of his books. If he doesn't suit you, there's always Dr. Suess!<br />He's one of the best, and he will always be one of the best. What's more, he has our Heavenly Father on his side. An annointed man with awesome stuff. All for the glory of God! Can't ask for too much more. Check it out!	2003-09-17

I enjoy the way that Brad Carson stands up to &quot;Ichabod&quot; while in the courtroom, but keeps the case on the line as well. This books shows how brutal The Muttawa can actually be, and how graceful and merciful our heavenly Father is. This book is a real page turner, with a good twist or two, and a very good pace to go with it! Amen, Mr. Singer! Keep it up!	2003-09-17

I remember the first Dekker book I got was Thunder of Heaven because I thought this one would be too slow. I was dead wrong! This book takes you outside of your comfort zone, you wonder what you might do if you were Kent. And of course, Helen is in comparison with The Energizer Bunny: She keeps going and going and going...<br />Ted Dekker is one of the most gifted authors out there. If I were to make a challenge out there to someone who feels that things aren't going just the way they feel they should, read this book! You'll feel a lot better.<br />Thank you Ted for putting ordinary people into extraordinary situations.	2003-09-17

They like to make North look like a traitor and a Bill Clinton basher. Let me tell you something, Clinton deserves to be bashed. WHAT HE DID... WAS WRONG!!! And this book isn't about how North should or shouldn't be classified as a traitor, it's about learning about being a Christian in the worst possible circumstances. It was about right and wrong. And I really do believe, that if you want to label me or anyone, or Oliver North a &quot;Bible Thumper&quot;, do you think we care? We are proud of who we are. We're Christian men, and we care about honoring God more than we do about serving someone such as a Bill Clinton! Like Lt. Col. Newman, we have to stand up for what is right and for what Jesus would think, not what society thinks we should stand up for. Bravo Lt. Col. North! This brother in Jesus Christ salutes you! AMEN!!!	2003-08-30

And if anyone takes away from this book, God will take away from him his share of the fruit of the tree of life and of the Holy City, which are described in this book.&quot;<br />Now if someone hates me for what I just said, that's ok. I love everyone because God commands me to. But I mean it when I say that I never read this book, and I never will!! It probably makes very good fire wood. And that is all it should be used for.	2003-08-16

I've read all of his books, and this one is just as good as his other works. I describe Robert Whitlow as the Tommy Lee Jones of Christian Fiction. Here's how that analogy works. Tommy Lee Jones is always cool, calm &amp; collected in his demeanor, but when the time is just right, HE EXPLODES and has you holding on to your seat! That is the same way with Robert Whitlow, and for the world of Christian Fiction, it is very refreshing.<br />This book has an awesome array of characters. You really get drawn into the plot, and more and more interested as Rena &amp; Ezra do battle concerning Baxter's life support, with Alex the attorney in the middle of it. This book paints a beautiful portrait of Christianity, at the peak of people under pressure, while trusting in God the whole time.	2003-08-15
US	30212713	R166ECHDXCRI20	0805462937	54403255	Anonymous Tip	Books	5	9	19	N	N	awesome, thought provoking!	I'm going to take a shot in the dark and say that this was Farris's 1st attempt at fiction. There were a couple of minor spelling errors and a couple of missed quotes, but it didn't by any means take away to the quality of the work. It was well written and well researched. People who can call a simple spanking, &quot;child abuse,&quot; they should avoid this book at all costs. If you are one of those kinds of people, try being a real parent! I found myself plugging for Peter Barron, along with Gwen Landis and her little girl, Casey. If anyone is offended by this work of Mr. Farris, I have some gentle advice, and this is gentle for myself. BOO-HOO-HOO!! Grow up and get a life. My Bible says that if you refuse to discipline a child, then you don't love them. Either you believe that, or you don't. But whether you do it with your mouth, or if you shake your head at what Farris has had the guts to say, nobody calls my God and my Jesus a liar!!! And those who do, by making loser remarks such as, &quot;Don't tell ME how to raise MY kids,&quot; let me tell you right now, if you belong to Him, Jesus will. Jesus will tell us how to raise our children. They belong to Him. Now if anyone has any arguments about my statement, please feel free to e-mail me anytime! And if that doesn't suffice, get a real life!<br />The real matter is this. Praise God for Michael Farris and for doing what is right! We need more people like him in this world, because we have too many non-educated sissies who are live in mom and dad's pocket, they are afraid of going against what our all popular society might say and last but certainly not least, these people are afraid of being thrown in jail because they don't rule their own home and are afraid of hurting their babies. A good crack in the tail never hurt anyone, and anyone who can call that child abuse is nothing but a coward! I look forward to EVERYTHING Michael Farris has out! Keep up the good work, brother, you give Christians a name well worth living for, a cause worth fighting for, and I can say that it is well worth living for Jesus Christ! AMEN!living for, a cause worth fighting for, and I can say that it is well worth living for Jesus Christ! AMEN!	2003-08-10

I was in a Christian Book Store and saw 3 Ted Dekker books, and they were of course, The Martyr's Song Series. On Heaven's Wager I noticed that Frank Peretti had recommended it, but when I looked at the back of the book, I didn't think it would be fast enough for me (silly me!) So I got Thunder of Heaven and asked for the other 2 books for Christmas. Needless to say I was impressed! Now some people might be wondering why I would mention Frank Peretti. That is a very important part of my story. You see my friends, Frank Peretti was my favorite Christian Fiction author, until he recommended Ted Dekker. Frank Peretti is still an awesome writer, but Dekker topps Peretti just barely. Ted Dekker does this. He puts ordinary people in a situation only God could get them out of, so you are in for a trip out of your comfort zone when you read him. I own all of Dekker's work, and it is worth twice as much as you pay for it. I've heard it been said that a layman is just an ordinary person who does extraordinary things for Jesus Christ. Ted Dekker, you truly are a layman for everyone who reads your work, and an inspiration. Praise God for this man!	2003-08-02
US	30212713	RIOV0AZ9BYR2F	0849943728	822018095	Three	Books	5	4	4	N	N	needs more than 5 stars	Ted Dekker has the ability to take Christians out of their comfort zone. Is that a bad thing? No. As a Christian, God calls people to do so with talents such as writing Christian fiction. I read this book pretty quickly. You don't read a Ted Dekker book and say it's boring. If you do, you are a very tough customer and cannot be pleased. I can go as far as to say that this book will even play with your mind a little bit. Maybe even more. I have everything Ted Dekker owns. When an author such as Frank Peretti can make a recommendation on certain books, you know it's a good book. You don't even ask questions. If you are looking for a milk and cookies book, then don't read this. If you are looking for a read that will challenge you, make you nervous and make you think, then read this book. Ted Dekker gets his work from The Lord, and it shows in everything he does. Any more questions, just buy one of his books. Start with THR3E.	2003-06-05
