This is one of those books that will keep you giggling long after you've closed it and shut off the lights for the night.  Cameron's turn of phrase is just so funny, his observations about men so, so true.  From leaving the toilet seat up, to snoring, to asking for directions, he covers the behavior of the modern man with a delightful sense of humor.  This is not male bashing--Cameron is, after all, a male himself, and when he pokes fun it is most often at his own failings.  His self-deprecation is both refreshing and hilarious. <br /> <br />How to Remodel a Man follows the course of Cameron's own journey to \\"Changed Man,\\" along the way exploring other topics such as dating, why men are so competitive, how to communicate with a man... and there is a sweet story involving his goofy crush on a woman at work, as well as his intervention in the emergency delivery of his cousin's baby.  In other words, this is a rich book, full of surprises and laughter!	2005-03-04

The subject looked outlandish and looked political--that is, I expected there to be an agenda here, an indictment of one particular administration or another.  Instead I was sucked in by DeMille's solid plotting and superior and fluid writing.  To my surprise I found no agenda, no preaching, just a fun read.  True, it is a book pulled from the headlines, but that isn't a bad thing, in this instance, but rather makes it seem all the more relevant and ultimately exciting.	2005-02-23

Not just because of the events of her life, which are astounding, but because of the upbeat and unblinking way in which Marcia Wallace examines her life.  This isn't a poetic book, a book of fine writing and carefully wrought prose... this is a book that sounds like an afternoon conversation with Marcia Wallace.  I loved every minute of it and feel like she is now my best friend in the world.	2005-02-23
US	14429061	R3FQ8TAUH0FYKO	0440224764	999720718	The Partner	Books	1	3	5	N	N	The quintessential Grisham -- and that's not a good thing	Read this book to get a feel for what nearly every other Grisham novel is like.  This is a novel about a big pot of money, and characters who have no souls who are chasing it around.  You won't care about the relationships--this is about dreaming what it would be like to have millions of dollars.  A lotto ticket might be a better investment.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the end except to say that it ends like all other Grisham books:  it won't make much sense, it will be \\"ironic\\" in the sense that suddenly characters behave completely differently than you would have expected, and it is a \\"twist\\" in the sense that the author has been holding out on you and then suddenly reveals a fact you should have known all along.  And, of course, it is about the money anyway.  I turned the last page realizing I didn't really care about anybody in this book, I just felt, for a little while, that I was going along for a 90 million dollar ride.	2005-02-23

It has the goose-bumps of a ghost story, and the page-turning plot of a mystery, but the real story is the way Spencer writes.  He has a way with the English language that is almost like no other.  I was simply amazed at the fluid prose, the careful construction.  The love story swept me up and kept me enthralled.  Spencer can write of obsessive love like no other author, but unlike his Endless Love, where the love had a creepy, stalker quality, this is the sweet and romantic love of a man who cannot give up on a woman just because she is dead.  Find a copy of this book and read it, you will love it.	2005-02-23
US	14429061	RJQFFD9428UPA	0156028808	76080055	The Blind Man of Seville	Books	3	11	14	N	N	Slow and confusing	I never could get traction in this book.  The slow start, combined with what I felt was a confusing similarity in the names of the characters, made for tough going.  Eventually it picked up the pace, but by then I had trouble caring.  If you enjoy the feel of a \\"foreign\\" novel, this will probably appeal--there is no doubt the author has captured the sense of living in Seville.  But if you want a quick, fast thriller that you can read hungrily, this one isn't for you.	2005-02-23

Rich and powerful and satisfying.	2005-02-23

Her words feel like they are polished and slipped into place one by one.  Her characters come to life so strongly that even after closing the cover of the book, you'll feel as if you know these people and one of them may call at any moment.   <br /> <br />Beyond character and writing, I found the plot, concerning a young womam with a cynical attitude suddenly thrust into one of life's most rewarding, yet challenging roles, to be fascinating.  This isn't a \\"chick lit\\" book, it is more like a female \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" with a hilarious first person view shielding a woman from her real feelings.   <br /> <br />This is a powerful first novel and this author is one to watch.	2005-02-23

This book cannot be put down when it is solidly in the 50's spy years.  As it brings us closer to the present day, the stakes are not as high, but by then we care about the characters and are eager to see decades old injustices addressed.  Recommended for anyone who loves spy novels, especially if it seems to you that spy novels just don't have much point now that the Soviet Union is gone.	2005-02-23

I found some of it funny, sure, but I also had to wade through a lot of text that was much less interesting to me.  My overall impression is that this is more of a marketing feat than a real book--this wasn't an author deciding to write something that was in his heart, but a product assembled to take advantage of the show's popularity.  There are books by real humorists out there--this is a compilation by a bunch of people you've never heard of.	2005-02-23

I never would have thought I would read a book that has words in the title like \\"soldier\\" and \\"war.\\"  But I was urged to give this a look and I knew the writer's other work, which was never short of wonderful.  This novel is amazing in scope and power.  Helprin is a true craftsman; his words seem to almost sing off the page.  And the main character is someone I came to care about deeply, his life and loves, his friends, the tragedies, and even the deep humor.  Yes, there is war here and even some exciting sequences which normally I tend to skim, not being a fan of \\"action.\\"  But the way Helprin writes draws you into the story and never lets go.	2005-02-23

You will be better off with one of the author's earlier works.  But if you want your cherished beliefs challenged, if you want to have cold water dashed on your long held convictions, this book is a wonderful way to have scientific data presented with a story to go along with it.  In the end you may feel a bit foolish when you examine the considerable evidence offered in support of the author's underlying thesis--I know I did.  But in the end, what I really craved was not an education but just a great fun book.  That's not what this is.	2005-02-23

Yet I found the plot curiously lackluster.  If you are a Berger fan, you'll pick this one up, but don't dive into it if you've never read anything of his.  You'd be better off with nearly any of his others.	2005-02-23

This is a book that gives us despicable characters in the raw, with such embarrassing moments I felt a little squeamish as I read it.  Yet it is undeniably funny and well written, a truly wonderful novel.   <br /> <br />Much more rich than the screen version, this book gives us four characters who don't seem to understand each other at all, yet must live next door to each other as new neighbors.	2005-02-23

Jefferson Parker fan with Silent Joe, but I have to say this one is my favorite.  A deep, complex, emotional mystery/thriller, with a real sense of danger.  You will care deeply about the characters and will never guess the ending.  I wish all writers who put so much into their plots would take a lesson from Parker--the more you care about the characters, the more you will care about what is happening!	2005-02-23

Think of James Thurber, O. Henry, and the more modern David Sadaris and W. Bruce Cameron.  Rich, full, delightful humor, all based on the human condition.  This is a collection of essays that is absolutely timeless, as funny now as when they were originally written.	2005-02-23

I am amazed that there are people out there with teenage daughters who have not read this book!  This hilarious work could have been sub-titled, \\"I feel your pain.\\"  Not just a series of jokes, Cameron has compiled a thorough examination of all the aspects of having a teenage daughter--Dating, Braces, Phone Calls, Curfew, Prom, etc.  And in the end he ties it all together with love and caring for his daughters, so that I found myself actually crying (not from laughter, as I had with all the previous chapters, but with an outpouring of emotions that I felt about my OWN father.)   <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this book more highly.  You really need to read it even if your daughter (or son!) is not yet in the teen years.  It is a wonderful book about families and parenthood.	2005-02-23

It was given to me by a friend because I had so enjoyed \\"He's Just Not That Into You,\\" but this is not the same author but just someone who decided to take advantage of the hard work of the original writers of the first book and name his book something similar.  I found none of the humor and warmth I was expecting, nor any delving into what is important to ME in a relationship, which is moral make up of people, their beliefs and feelings.  Everyone is stripped down to their biology.  It is as if someone filmed a high school biology lecture and then named it \\"Lord of the Rings\\" so people would buy it.	2005-02-23

I can't complain about the writing, which is well crafted, nor the characters, but I did feel that the middle of the book sagged a bit, leaving me feeling a bit listless as I turned the pages, struggling through a long subplot about which I really didn't care much.  If you enjoy fine literature, this will not disappoint, and I am certain this will be one of those books that is read by many for years to come.  If you need a light book for an airplane, something with a fast moving plot, this one isn't going to do it for you.	2005-02-23

I have to confess I was let down when I saw that it was about the insurance industry--what could be more boring?  But \\"boring\\" is exactly the wrong word to use to describe this wonderfully exciting novel.  I was hooked from the first few pages and just could not put it down.  This is one of those suspense thrillers where you love the characters and are so swept up in the story you forget to make dinner for yourself.  The disappearance of a woman who looks as if she is involved in a scheme to peculate millions leads a former lover on a quest to uncover her fate, and he soon finds himself embroiled in a deep conspiracy.  This is believable, a book about greed and love, that will fascinate you.	2005-02-23

Women, in this telling, are manipulative creatures who lure in a man, tricking him and lying to him, following not her own heart but a cold blooded pursuit of a man by attempting to exploit his weaknesses.  I'll confess I read the whole thing because I was completely horrified to think that there are any women out there like this!  It made me ashamed of my gender. <br /> <br />I believe these rules would work--if you don't care about love or happiness, but are only interested in finding a shallow, stupid man with a lot of money.  Don't read this if you have a heart, it isn't for romantics, it is for sociopaths.	2005-02-23

Yes, it has a pulse-pounding plot and an ending that comes straight out of the thriller genre, but along the way this book pulls us all deeply into the issues of Vietnam, making us examine how we feel, and sweeping us up into a moving and powerful story.  Of all the DeMille books, this is the best one to read, in my opinion.	2005-02-23

My recommendation, though, is that all parents should consider reading this book.  It is a wonderful look at the frustrations we all feel, the self-doubt and self-loathing and even those moments when we wonder why we ever had children.  I cried when I read this book, it is so brave and loving and heartfelt.  Even if your child doesn't have special needs, you should consider reading this book for the wonderful honesty.	2005-02-23

On Valentine's Day this is what I did:  I bought this book.

I'm still waiting for that guy to call but in the meantime I read Michon's book and I wound up staying awake half the night.  This is the tender tale of five women, the members of a chapter of the \\"Grrl Genius\\" club, who work through problems of divorce, death, love, and life, with dog custody and trying to \\"trap\\" a man into proposing and gourmet food and chocolate and fun facts about animal love.
