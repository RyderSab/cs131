Basically, describing an econometric approach to evaluating ideas or somewhat like applying Sabermetrics to business.<br /><br />Pros: The book is a very good introduction to MVT and the process used by QualPro Consulting.  Makes a compelling case for the need to test ideas in combination to achieve true synergy and to rely on empirical evidence versus conventional wisdom which is sometimes wrong.  I also liked the case the author makes for using practical, fast and no cost ideas because those ideas used in the right combination tend to be more effective than those requiring an investment in capital.  Finally, the book gives a good contrast of MVT versus Six Sigma.<br /><br />Cons: While the book has an easy to read style, it also reads like a brochure for QualPro's services and gets annoying after awhile.  That is also the \\"catch\\" to using MVT.  According to the book, you need a QualPro trained consultant to facilitate the process because of the advanced statistics involved.  So using MVT is not cost-free in that you need to hire a consultant for implementation or make a sizable investment in training and time to bring this expertise into your organization.  Therefore, MVT as described by this book is useful only to those organizations that have the resources to hire a MVT consultant.  This would potentially exclude small companies or distressed companies that could really make use of MVT, though I personally believe that MVT can be used without relying on QualPro or another consultant.<br /><br />Bottomline: If used only as a primer, this is a good book on MVT.  As a guide, it will only be useful for larger organizations.	2005-05-08

The book gets 2 stars because the few pages devoted to entrepreneurship has very little substance and the information under each idea is sparse and in many cases not helpful.  In addition, there are numerous ideas that require a tremendous amount of work.  The author does state that what may be work for one person, may be play to another.  However, this relates to doing something you enjoy or having a passion where you don't mind putting in the time or work.  The title suggests that the business ideas listed in the book will not require a great deal of time or effort, which is not the case for many of the ideas(Masonry, Restauranteur for example).<br /><br />This book has some value for those that have not read similar books of this type.  Otherwise, I would take a pass on this one.	2005-03-23

The book is well researched and does explain how bubbles start, grow and end.  However, I would not say that this book is amusing or insightful and I agree that none of the information or suggestions will be heeded during the next bubble.<br /><br />My problem with the book is that it is written like a research paper or dissertation with a lot of quotes that disrupts the flow of the book.  The first two chapters of the book(more than 50%) devote over 100 pages to examining how bubbles arise.  Yet, there is nothing new that hasn't been written by others.  The suggestions given in the last chapter are not insightful and will help little in protecting yourself once a bubble bursts.<br /><br />Again, the book is well researched and accurate in regards to the dynamics of a bubble and thus the three star rating.  I would recommend this book for researchers, academics and MBA-types pursuing a career in Venture Capital.  To others, I recommend reading the Introduction, which summarizes the first two chapters, and the last chapter to get the gist of what the book was written to provide.	2005-03-14

This book fails to capture and hold your attention because the author's writing style makes his story of discovering the positive impact of storytelling uninteresting.<br /><br />There are some positives in the book.  If you are involved in knowledge management, you may be able to follow the story a little better.  Also, the appendix tells you the essential elements of a springboard story and takes stories in the book and dissects them into those elements.  Finally, the book touches both on crafting the story and delivering the story, though neither is treated with a lot of depth.<br /><br />If you already have experience with storytelling and want a reference on how to apply to business, this book could be useful.  However, I would first look for a used copy to purchase.	2005-02-09

The book is decent, probably worth 2.5 stars, but there is nothing new contained in terms of the content.<br /><br />From the title alone, you may think that this is a book a how-to guide or would cover traditional and non-traditional ways of working for yourself.  The book is actually about the psychology of work and money, and how to change your life by changing the way you think.  It then covers various topics such as affirmations, visualization, NLP and entering a meditative (optimal learning) state.  It stresses confronting then forgetting about the past in order to move forward and taking responsibility for what happens in your life.  I agree that a person's thinking and how they see themselves is important to accomplishing their goals.  In that respect, this book is more useful for those that need to change their thinking and those who are not familiar with this part of the self-help genre.<br /><br />What really takes away from the book are the opinions that are included in the text that could turn some people off.  Several times the authors state that you should not listen to Country and Western or Rap because they are negative.  While I understand the premise of not being influenced by negative lyrics, it is wrong to single out a specific type of music because all types can be both positive and negative.  There is also a point in the book where the authors refer to Downtown Detroit as an urban wasteland.  Again, whether this is the case or not, it adds nothing to the book and, for some people, take away from it.<br /><br />Overall, an okay read, but nothing illuminating.	2004-10-05

Some good stories but also questionable	This book reminds me of \\"What Should I Do With My Life?\\" by Po Bronson, just shorter and with an emphasis on finding a more quality place to live.  I didn't mind the side stories about the author's flying experiences and didn't think it took much from the book.<br /><br />There are two things about the book which I had problems.  First, the people profiled were high achievers and not typical of the average citizen that lives in high priced urban areas and is looking for an alternative.  Technology has allowed for people to work in places outside of the large cities and it would have been nice to hear about \\"regular\\" people who have been able to make the transition to smaller places.  The people in the book would probably be successful wherever because of the track record and capital that they had previously built.  The second thing I had a problem with was the third section \\"150 Cheap Places to Live\\".  There are places listed that I had not considered and merit further research.  However, there are place listed, such as Boulder, CO, that are very expensive, unless you are downsizing from a house in LA, Silicon Valley, etc...  Also, some of the choices are suspect.  For example, Cleveland is listed under Bohemian Bargains, yet this city has the highest percentage of residents living in poverty.  Omitted was Dallas, TX which has fairly low housing prices and a stable economy versus Austin, which is also reasonable, but not as diverse of an economy.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed reading the book and it is a starting place for thinking about alternative locations to live.	2004-09-28

It's concise and can be read in a day.  Some entertaining stories and a few nuggets of inspiration.<br /><br />As a downside, readers may find the book more anecdotal and most of the \\"Rules\\" are common sense.  However, the author does state in the introduction that this is not meant to be a \\"how-to\\" guide, rather like talking to an older mentor.  Though the principles are common sense, I do agree with the author that it is the little things like having manners and being yourself that does make the difference.<br /><br />Again, a good book that would make a great gift for a young person starting out in life or an experienced person that needs some grounding.	2004-09-27

As a strategist, I have found most books that attempt to apply Eastern Thought to business to be either poorly written or with little practical application.  I found this book to be concise, practical and an enjoyable read.<br />Each of the 36 Stratagems are easy to understand.  The author provides both business and historical case studies as examples of how each stratagem were applied in the past.  An appendix is included that is meant to help brainstorm ways to apply the stratagems in business.<br />The only downside to the book is that you could argue many of the business cases were selected to &quot;fit&quot; with each stratagem, meaning the companies did not consciously set out to use various stratagems.  I would say that it speaks to the unwillingness of Western companies to learn and apply eastern business strategies.  Also, it would have been nice if there were cases featuring Asian businesses that applied the principles in the book.  However, this does not take away from the book's value.<br />Again, an excellent read strategists, managers, entrepreneurs or anyone interested in Eastern Philosophy.	2004-05-19

How to Use Everyday Ingenuity to Solve Problems Big and Small	Books	5	22	27	N	N	Definitely Recommend	I have a huge interest in creativity and have read many books on the subject.<br />What I liked most about the book was its pragmatic approach to creativity/problem-solving.  Rather than going through dozens of techniques and suggestions to inspire breakthrough solutions, it breaks the process down into two parts: Finding solutions and Applying existing solutions; and four techniques.  While there is definitely a need for truly original ideas and solutions, there is also value in building on existing ideas.  Many books on entrepreneurship preach this method for generating business ideas.  This book does a good job on telling you how to do that.<br />In addition, the writing style of the authors make it a fast and enjoyable read.<br />As for negatives, I thought the discussion on &quot;Why can't you feel my pain?&quot; could have been explained better and the placement of some exercises disrupted the flow of the book.<br />Keep in mind that the focus of the book is presenting a way to look at problems and solutions.  While there are suggestions and examples, I would not consider this a step by step guide to creativity.<br />Overall, a very good book worth reading.	2003-11-03

The main premise of the book is that the answer to &quot;What should I do with my life?&quot; does not typically come in a flash of insight or by seeking to discover yourself first.  Rather, it comes from trying different ideas or alternatives and then reflecting on the experiences.<br />I have been engaged in the exercise of finding the right career for the past three years.  I have did all manners of self-tests, journals, coaching and personality tests to find the answer.  This isn't to say that my efforts were wasted because I was able to gain clarity into what I liked and disliked.  The problem is that I never took action because I was looking for an &quot;aha!&quot; moment of discovery that never came.  By reading &quot;Working Identity&quot; I have discovered that it is normal not to have an &quot;aha!&quot; and that the real value is taking what I have done and put it into action in order to discover what I would like to do.<br />In addition to the approach described by the author, the book is a short read, is well researched(with the research methods included) and has numerous stories as examples.  The writing does get somewhat dry and academic in parts, but that is more than offset by the approach, short length and the stories.<br />I highly recommend!	2003-03-02

From the title you can guess that I highly recommend this book. \\"CIG to Calculus\\" covers all of the topics from the first year of a university calculus course. The vast majority of the topics are explained in plain, clear and concise english, which is the strength of the book. This book is not meant to be a replacement to a textbook, but as a supplement. The shame is that there is a need for books such as these because the \\"so called experts\\" cannot clearly communicate the subject matter in lecture or written form.<br />If you are planning to take calculus for the first time, use this book to help your understanding of your textbook and lecture notes. If this is for self-study, read this book and use a book with a lot of solved problems to cement your understanding.<br />Again, this, in my opinion, is the best book to date on beginning calculus.	2003-02-16

This book falls somewhere between the extreme negative and positive reviews.  The book reassures that there are others pondering what they should be doing with their lives, that it is not unusual to ask the question and there are numerous paths to finding an answer.  The book has been criticized for featuring \\"over-educated\\" and \\"multi-degreed\\" people. I do agree, yet these are the very people who not only ask the question, but also try to actively find the answer.  Also, there is criticism for the author inserting his own story within the book.  I personally didn't think it took away from the book and it gave some insight on why he chose to write this particular book.<br />I would have liked to have seen a more diverse collection of people.  For example, I am African-American and I am definitely pondering the question of what to do with my life.  Given Mr. Bronson's background and his method of collecting the stories for the book, it is natural that the responses would come from those that travel in similar circles.  However, to make the book more complete, Mr. Bronson should have made an attempt to find other ethnicities and those in lower economic classes that are not just asking the question, but trying to answer it.<br />To get the most out of the book, don't expect for it to give you the answer, just to encourage you to keep searching.  Also, don't get wrapped up in who is profiled, but really look at the stories to find common issues and how people dealt with them.	2003-02-04

Past works on real options analysis(ROA) have been heavy on theory, but low on application.  However, as I read through this book I was disappointed in how the content was presented.<br />First, the good points.  The book is more application-oriented than other books on the subject thus far.  The book is thorough in its discussion of real options analysis, and demonstrates how to estimate volatility, which has been poorly explained by other authors.  The book provides lots of case studies and examples.  Finally, the methodology is simple to follow.<br />Now, the bad points.  Enough has been written about the book's errors in other reviews.  Also, the solutions should have been provided for free.  The most disappointing part is the authors' claim that this is a &quot;practitioners&quot; guide and that ROA will eventually replace NPV in corporate valuation.  If you are a financial engineer or quant-jock for an I-Bank, Consultancy or Treasury group, then it is a practitioner's guide.  Otherwise, the book is written above the level of the industry financial analyst, particularly beginners.  The authors' use Everett Roger's five attributes of innovation that determine its rate of adoption.  One attribute is low complexity for easy understanding and implementation.  This book is very complex and it's no wonder why ROA has a slow adoption rate among corporations.<br />Bottomline, the book needs to be rewritten properly from an editorial standpoint.  More importantly, Mr. Copeland needs to decide whether he truly wants to bring ROA to the corporate masses or keep it in the hands of a few who can sell their expertise to companies	2002-01-29

My complaint is that it is too anecdotal which makes the book longer than it needs to be.  That being said, the author gives a preview at the beginning of each chapter and provides action steps at the end.  My suggestion to a prospective buyer is to first read the previews and action steps to determine whether the book will be useful for your needs.  Some of the reviews have stated that the content in the book is not new or that it is to simple.  I suspect that those with a background in marketing might find the material redundant.  The book will probably be more useful for non-marketing types.  As for the content being too simple, I'm from the school of thought that business is based on simple concepts and should be explained in that manner.<br />The best way to use the book is to read through for ideas and consult other books, the internet and/or people for specific help.  For example, Chapter 6 discusses the importance of a unique selling proposition(USP).  I would read the chapter, jot down ideas from the book, then look for resources that deal specifically with developing a USP.<br />Hope this review is helpful.	2001-11-07

Two of the previous reviews lament the lack of practical ideas.  However, the author states that this is not a &quot;how-to&quot; book, but a book on ideas.  If your purpose is to find specific strategies and to be walked through the implementation, then you will be disappointed.  If you are looking for new ways to think about business in order to create your own ideas, then the book will serve its purpose.<br />Some key take aways were the concepts of growing solutions, cooperative game theory(which is validated in Coopetition), communication strategy and new venture probability.  I am using the concept of growing solutions via listserves and virtual teams to create a strategy for a deregulated electric utility.  In trying to start my own company, I have been stumped on how to get started.  The author addresses this problem by using the Hilbert Space/Green Frog concept to get started, which is half the battle in itself.  It's been said that the definition of an entrepreneur is a person who brings together resources.  This book discusses ways to do this utilizing the Internet.<br />The book is not without it's drawbacks.  The reading tends to get bogged down as you get into the latter half of the book, though the author summarizes everything in the last chapter.  Some of the explanations do get academic(Hilbert Space and Game Theory).  Finally, better examples and cases would have been nice.<br />Overall, the ideas sparked by this book was worth the price and the 5 star rating.	2001-05-01

I have doubts about many of the reviews that claim fast results from copying the techniques from the book.  However, the book is not as bad as those that have given it low reviews.  The reality is more towards the middle.  The book contains sound advice on target marketing, establishing a web presence and building traffic and a customer list.  In addition, there are good tidbits throughout the book.  To get the greatest amount of value from this book, you need to be able to grasp the concepts behind the ideas in the book and apply them in a unique way.  If you simply try and copy the ideas out of the book, you will have a low probability of success.<br />I agree that the book is self-serving and may be ghost written.  But there is value in aggregating content into one place.  Also, the book does no more damage than the academic or MBA level books on Internet marketing and strategy.<br />Overall, if you are new to e-Commerce and looking for ideas on how to get started, it's a good read if seek to understand the principles behind the ideas rather than trying to copy them.	2001-04-10

I purchased this book(along with Infinite Self) based on the previous reviews.  I found the content to be okay, nothing earth-shattering from either a business or meta-physical standpoint.  Where I had the most problems was with the author's writing style.  The author tends to ramble, though he includes some good stories.<br />In terms of content, I recommend this book for those that have not been exposed to books on how to think about money and success.  Others may find the content redundant.  In terms of style, it will depend upon the taste of the reader, but the principles could have been laid out in less than 50 pages.	2001-02-09

Since I'm not a marketing person, I found the book useful.What I got was a different perspective on how to market to customersvia the Internet.  It also stimulated my thinking on some alternativeways to market my business ideas.  Where the book falls short is thatthere is little &quot;how to&quot; information for implementing theideas.  However, if it gave &quot;how to&quot; information, thenpeople would just copy the techniques rather than taking the conceptsand creating orignal ideas of their own.  Also, the information in thebook is somewhat repetitive, but this does help to reinforce thecontent.<br />Will this book become an ideavirus?  Probably not.  But ifyou are new to Internet marketing, it's a good read.  ...	2000-10-29

The majority of people do not have the time to thoroughly research stocks in order to build a portfolio that will earn the 12%+ per year needed to retire.  Also, the book makes the correct  point that it is very hard to beat the market in the long run, and by  investing in indexes, a person can do just as well at a lower cost as an  investment professional.  If you are looking to become the next  Buffett, Soros, Lynch, etc..., buy another book.  If you are looking for a  simple, inexpensive, less time consuming way to build a portfolio, this is  a good book to buy.  To comment on the one negative review, yes the author  could have explained everything in 20-30 pages, but the writing is easy to  read and when you get down to it, most books can be condensed to fewer  pages.  Enjoy!	1999-12-14

The title caught my eye and after a quick preview decided to take a chance. The first couple of chapters and the table of contents got me pumped, but after that I could barely finish it because of the babble and musings. There is some good information in the book, but not enough to justify buying. A much better book is \\"Kiss Off Corporate America\\" by Lisa Kivirist. It's also a motivational type book for going solo, but I found it more practical and a much easier read.	1999-11-22
