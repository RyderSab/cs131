In this book, he picks up a theme from his earlier work:  \\"Imagination\\" (Feast of Fools) and leads the reader along with his students and others in a welcome encounter with Jesus the Rabbi.  I actually felt as if I were in the classroom or on the campus with Professor Cox and his students, joining in the ongoing response to the \\"parable\\" of Jesus' life.<br /><br />Jesus now \\"belongs to the world,\\" Cox writes, and this book goes a long way toward helping us all sort through contemporary stories about Jesus, whether \\"toxic\\" or \\"salutary.\\"<br /><br />Jesus lives!	2005-02-11

In particular, his discussion of &quot;plenitude&quot; (evoking Mumford here), Roszak provides an elegant alternative to our current fascination with mindless surfeit.<br />The Principles of Ecospychology are sketched in an Epilogue, rooted in the assertion that &quot;the person is anchored within a greater, universal identity&quot; than that which has been presented in earlier psychologies.  Here the goal is to &quot;awaken the sense of environmental reciprocity that lies within the ecological unconscious.  Other therapies seek to heal the alienation between person and person, person and family, person and society.  Ecopsycholgy seeks to heal the more fundamental alienation between the person and the natural environment.&quot;<br />A very useful appendix, &quot;God and Modern Cosmology,&quot; provides an annotated bibliography for continued study of the growing convergence between science and religion.	2004-03-05

In this promiscuous and universal conversation, everyone must abandon the attempt to corner the market....&quot; (page 142)<br />In an increasingly global society, this kind of conversation is a universal personal imperative for those seeking a way beyond the God Brokers and True Believers in the perennial quest for truth.	2004-02-02

The very inviting format also helped to pull me right in, but I soon realized that this is a book for those just beginning the spiritual journey, and in a conventional Christian setting.  And this may be a good starting place for some, but contemporary adult seekers are increasingly expecting a bigger perspective on God then that which is offered here.  Not to deny the right of those who wish to present God, religion or spirituality from limited perspectives, but adults are better served when authors at least acknowledge up front that they are speaking in the context of a particular tradition.<br />The authors of this book seem only able to speak of God exclusively in evangelical, bible-believing terms (see the chapters on the Bible, Jesus and church).  Nowhere in the text do they acknowledge this perspective or relate it to the everyday &quot;details&quot; of pluralism, a definite must for those who would speak authentically to contemporary adult seekers.  Granted, these reservations may seem to be &quot;small stuff,&quot; but for so many today they are the &quot;details&quot; God, it seems, has chosen to be &quot;in.&quot;	2002-03-03

Hellwig awakened me to the sense that understanding Catholicism (or any tradition) is indeed a lifelong process.  Catechesis is ongoing, at least in my experience, and this is very much unlike the idea, increasingly found in conventional Catholicism, that we somehow have managed to fully articulate the Christian vision.	2001-07-22

Palmer's voice needs to be heard by many now crusading for education reform if schools are to live up to their potential for spiritual transformation and cultural renewal.

Regarding biblical history and morality, Eisler notes that &quot;to the extent that it reflects a [male] dominator society, it is at best stunted.&quot;<br />Continuing with biblical history as she advances her analysis forward to the present day, Eisler writes that &quot;the more gylanic followers of Jesus tried to transform the cross on which he was executed into a symbol of rebirth- a symbol associated with a social movement that set out to preach and practice human equality and such &quot;feminine concepts as gentleness, compassion and peace.&quot;  Eisler also details the attempt by some Gnostic Christians to establish a continuum of psycho-sexual identity in the face of opposition from church patriarchs as another instance of the gylanic retreating in the face of androcratic political power.  I found this revisionist adventure to be very useful, and I recommend it to those seeking the reintegration of a culture mesmerized by scientism, materialism, and the faux enlightenment of prosperity.	2001-03-27

Palmer describes public experience as our &quot;life among strangers with whom our lot is cast, with whom we are interdependent whether we like it or not.&quot;  And the educational process is one &quot;which brings us out of ourselves into an awareness of our connectedness.&quot;  At its core, public education recognizes the fundamental dignity of a &quot;relationship rooted in our common humanity.&quot;  Public education then, unlike private forms, will consciously underscore the shared primary elements of social experience without giving preferential treatment to limited secondary characteristics based on wealth, economic status, race, religion or ideology.<br />&quot;In this process,&quot; Palmer continues, &quot;opinions become audible and accountable and individuals learn that private viewpoints have implications for the common good.  Under the pressure of accountability religious discourse may be forced to reach for the essentials which unite us.&quot;  In contrast to withdrawal from public participation into private enclaves of conspicuous consumption or of opting to participate only as a convinced crusader invincibly armored to fend of responsible dialogue,  Palmer notes that &quot;public life becomes the spiritual guide of our private life.&quot;  Truth, he continues, &quot;is a very large matter, and requires various angles of vision to be seen in the round.&quot;  Such an  assessment of public experience is, in my view, what makes American education a &quot;very large matter,&quot; requiring each of us to renew the commitment to public education.  In this way we may be drawn out of ourselves to the point where our angle of vision allows us to see and to respect the common ground we share with others.	2001-03-23

Growing up in Brooklyn, in a large family  always financially challenged, we moved from apartment to apartment under a  shared dream that we would someday have the &quot;house in the  country.&quot;  My father, myself and other siblings were also involved in  show business for a time, although I did not continue beyond what I needed  to do then to be part of this other hand me down family dream:  Making it  in the big time.  Jacobsen's book helped me to clarify this dual aspect of  my family's influence (quest for rootedness and finding a voice) on my life  course (or &quot;career&quot;), to acknowledge that one was put on hold  (voice) while I achieved the other (rootedness), and that I can now reclaim  and develop the other on my own terms even if it does not yield a career in  the conventional sense.  So even if you are not unhappy with your current  job or career, read this book for transformational insight on the family  dreams animating your life.	2000-06-25

In an age when adults are turning to conventional piety in greater numbers,  it seems, Booth's book is a practical guide for developing authentic adult  spirituality rooted in wisdom when the \\"God Box\\" offered in  contemporary forms of True Believerism loses its allure.<br /><br />I consider works  like Booth's (and many others) to be a kind of \\"warning label\\" on  the real dangers of devotion associated with the resurgent fundamentalism  and parochialism found today in most religious institutions and spiritual  movements.  Booth's work meets a growing need for spiritual recovery among  adults who become disillusioned with the polarization, polemics and  proselytism too often associated with naive forms of religious enthusiasm,  however orthodox and \\"grown-up\\" in nature.<br /><br />Chapter by chapter,  Booth leads the reader in recovery from the \\"numbing effects of...  religiosity\\" (page 11), to the \\"reclaiming of spiritual power  lost to dysfunctional or outmoded religious messages.\\" (page  13).<br /><br />Thanks to Leo Booth for encouraging us all to \\"experience 'The  Way' demonstrated not just by Jesus, but by so many great spiritual leaders  and teachers in all cultures and walks of life.

But for those who cannot carve out the time, this fine book comes as near to the real thing as I've seen. Pythia Peay's transcription and editing of retreat sessions by Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan allows the reader to participate in the \\"process of inner unveiling\\" (ix) and awakening at the heart of this very readable and ecumenical book. With a gentle insistence on the development of conscience (\\"awakening in life\\") as a result of \\"awakening beyond life\\", Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan provides an antidote to mystified notions of spirituality and the disengagement often associated with conventional religious enthusiasm. Here are some of Pir Vilayat's own words from a book filled with authentic wisdom: \\"Though the mystical encounter goes deeper than words can convey, tangible traces of it can be seen in the actions we take, the values we uphold, and the ideals we strive for. In effect, what I am trying to say is that the illumination of consciousness leads inevitably to the awakening of conscience. This enables us to fulfill the purpose of our lives and actualize the unfurling of the potentialities of our beings.... there is no limit to the responsibility we bear toward others.

Yet it is an account of a return to Christianity, and reportedly, a faith  of any kind, so I am understanding of the \\"beginner's\\" tone to it  all. At the outset, Norris describes her effort with the analogy of an  infant and writes of \\"rudiments of words\\" forming in her response to the language of Christianity (page 2).  \\"Religion came to seem just  one more childhood folly that I had to set aside as an adult,\\" Norris  continues.  \\"In my mid-thirties, however, it became necessary to begin  to reclaim my faith.\\"  And later, on page 169 she writes, \\"faith  is still a surprise to me, as I lived without it for so long.\\"<br /><br />What I  find surprising is how someone with such obviously well-honed reflective  skills seems to be implying that she lived without faith prior to the  return to Christianity.  It just doesn't seem likely, at least from my  perspective as a seeker with a similar spiritual story.  Must experience  be Christian to be faith-filled?  God, I believe, is present in all of  life, and faith experiences within or outside a particular tradition (even  prior to affiliation or return) provide a \\"surplus of meaning\\"  which religions never fully capture, I suspect.  Religions do help  illuminate experience in a particularly helpful way, so they can be useful  partners in the journey of personal transformation, helping us to discern  God's presence as the \\"hidden wholeness\\" (Merton) in those times  when we thought we were without faith.<br /><br />Maybe Norris will reflect on this  aspect in the future for those readers who sense that if a return to church (or religion) is not also a return to the world of profane experience, then  it may seem cloistered indeed.  What Norris may find in such an effort, to  borrow a phrase from Caroline Myss,  is just how \\"richly guided\\"  our lives have been at all times.  Now that is truly amazing grace.\\"richly guided\\"  our lives have been at all times.  Now that is truly amazing grace.	2000-01-27

All the more reason to learn the lessons of generational forgiveness and healing so wisely taught in this book.  As I  continue to research my own family's history, and to write what I know of  the family story, this book is helping me to take a more compassionate  stance toward my own parents. Dr. Grosskopf skillfully blends anecdotal  accounts, biblical narratives, fairy tales and religious proverbs to help  the reader ask their own parents, in a way which heals, the question from  God to humanity in the biblical book of Genesis:  \\"Where are  you?\\"<br /><br />Of particular use to me is the way the author reinterprets the  fifth commandment's \\"honor thy father and thy mother.\\"  While  reading through chapter two I was struck by the liberating potential for  forgiveness in hearing the command to \\"honor\\" parents not as an  authoritarian dictate but instead as an invitation to \\"imagine\\"  parents as the powerful but complex individuals they really are.<br /><br />In chapter  four, Dr. Grosskopf underscores the need we all have for  \\"witnesses\\" to our emotional pain and how restorative it can be  for parents when their children meet such a need.  For me, the main insight  here is that children who would honor their parents (and heal themselves)  can best do so in learning how to ask them (or others) \\"where are  you\\" without implying judgment or rejection.  In this way the answers  may repair and transform the fabric of life shared by parents and children  and all of society.	1999-12-12

The approach here fosters  understanding of how the bible actually came to be and how it may be read  for meaning rather than for mere certainty.<br /><br />I am in the second year of use  with a small group of adults at a parish in Pennsylvania and it is proving  to be very helpful, especially with so much recent news about the Bible and  related trends, issues and initiatives concerning spirituality, education,  and social values. The Bible text itself is presented in an easy-to-read  format, with excellent footnotes and cross-references.<br /><br />But the real value,  at least in our group where a great deal of Biblical background is all so  new, is in the reading Guide and associated study aids.  All of this is  presented in a way that non-Catholics will also find to be useful. The  Reading Guide material is presented with a minimum of jargon and technical  discussion, allowing first-time students to quickly acquire a basic  familiarity with the essentials of Bible study from a critical perspective.  Clearly designed charts, diagrams and maps also assist students in the  goal of appreciating the historical development of the Bible, a process  which is too often neglected (or even demonized) in many popular forms of  Bible study.<br /><br />The Catholic Study Bible takes an eyes-wide-open approach to  Biblical studies while maintaining an appreciation of the text as the word  of God within particular human events and experiences.  Discussion-generating questions are also provided along the way to support  the small-group experience. Sprinkled throughout, yet associated with  specific books of the Bible presented in the Reading Guide, users will find  book-by-book commentary and insightful essays and entries on a wide array  of related topics, including:<br /><br />The Four Sources Theory of the  Pentateuch;  Characteristics of Apocalyptic Literature;  Myth;  Did Moses Write the Pentateuch?;  How the Bible Has Been Read in  History;  Are Some Genesis Stories Just Rewrites of Ancient Myths?;  The Process of Transforming Life Experience Into a Text and Beyond;  MSL:  Metaphor as a Second Language;  Determining the Full Meaning of a  Text;  The Importance of Story.<br /><br />Perhaps unique to this study Bible is  the inclusion of an in-depth (but very readable) Glossary which is very  strong on explanation of Jewish Biblical and religious terms.  This  learning tool is a real plus for those who want to understand how  Christianity developed within a Jewish setting.  Brief entries are quickly  located to provide understanding of many ideas essential to a contemporary  appreciation of the Bible, including: canonical criticism; fundamentalist;  historical-critical method; literary criticism; paleography; redaction  criticism; source criticism; textual criticism; transmission history;  For the Catholic reader a guide to the Sunday Readings and the major feasts  of the year is also provided.acteristics of Apocalyptic Literature;  Myth;   Did Moses Write the Pentateuch?;  How the Bible Has Been Read in  History;  Are Some Genesis Stories Just Rewrites of Ancient Myths?;   The Process of Transforming Life Experience Into a Text and Beyond;   MSL:  Metaphor as a Second Language;  Determining the Full Meaning of a  Text;  The Importance of Story.
