I am very frustrated that no one has been brought to justice over the murder of her daughter, I give Lois alot of credit for her strength.	2001-11-01

I love the 2 other books from Suzy Spencer that I have read, but this one left me wondering why, and how?<BR>I wish there was more explanation about the two killers, I felt like I learned more about Lisa, Chris' girlfriend then I did the killers.	2001-09-06

US	51362896	RJFG3UDNNU9KT	096290841X	822997476	Manson: Behind the Scenes	Books	2	4	6	N	N	disappointed!	I expected so much more from this book. Nelson, like him or not he has so much info on the Family that this book could have been great. Unfortunately Bill jumps from topic to topic and mispells many words. I would love to read a book soley on the Family and not Manson and the crimes. I dont recommend this book unless of course you are a collector of Manson books.	2001-07-08

But it still was a bit confusing.  Anyone who wasnt familiar with the scene and didnt know who was who would be lost.	2000-12-10

I wish Dee Dee could have dished the dirt a little more (especially about the lyrics to 53rd &amp; 3rd) I wish it could have been longer and a little more detailed.	2000-12-10

I didnt find out anything new.  There were alot of drawings of Manson and cartoons that were somewhat interesting but I expected more.  Still it is a must have for a collector of Manson books, can be hard to find.	2000-10-17
US	51362896	R2DZQAPOEKE646	0449911411	982601585	And I Don't Want to Live This Life: A Mother's Story of Her Daughter's Murder	Books	5	1	1	N	N	very honest and touching	I read this book about 3 years ago and it got me started on a long list of  books dealing with the sex pistols and that whole era of music.  The  writing in this book is very honest and heartfelt.  It made me feel very  sad for Nancy as well as for her family.  Many people (who knew both of  them and were around at the time) do not believe that Sid killed Nancy  rather that a drug dealer did (either way a sad ending for both of them) I  recommend this book highly.	2000-08-11
US	51362896	RVIXRG3C8OGR0	067170088X	917004051	The Sunset Murders	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Very detailed, well written	I read this book a few years ago and I still wonder about Carol Bundy. She is the most pathetic person, she still wants to help Doug Clark even though  he has tried to blame the murders on her. This book was very detailed, Farr  did a very thourough job in describing all the details that true crime  buffs love.	2000-08-02

Any book she writes is a must have.  The fact that she new Bundy is shocking. She writes with care, warmth and extreme knowledge of not only the killers but the victims and  their families too.  This book told the most accurate info on Bundy where  some other books on him only concentrate on the gore aspect.	2000-07-30

I guess she needed the money so decided to dish the dirt and try to make  herself look good.  It had its ok parts but most of the book was just  Cyrinda whining.	2000-07-30

This book has everything, addictions, lovers, music and sad endings for some.  A great tribute to the  most forgotten band. They never got the respect they deserved for the style  they started which is so copied now.	2000-07-30

This book describes everly last detail known on the case (which some find a little boring) If you want all the details you must read this. It boggles my mind that some actually think he is innocent and look up to him.  I am  so glad he got what he deserved.	2000-07-30

Doesn't matter if your straight, gay, male or female.  I loved how Frank describes his family members and his life.  It was very touching, witty, and it really opened my eyes to what gay boys  have to go through to try to feel excepted.	2000-07-30

Yes I do believe in some ways Susan was a pawn for Manson, but we all must pay for our own actions. I am sure she is re-born (being in prison that long, most  criminals do become born again) The book was a little boring, and didnt get  into enough of her life with the family.  I wonder what ever became of her  son?	2000-07-29

A good look at the inside of the members and how they lived.  A must read for anyone who read  Helter Skelter.	2000-07-28

I would still recommend  this book to any true crime fan.	2000-07-28

This book haunted me for days.  This is one sick family and I wonder what the kids will grow up to be, how will they raise their own  family with Fred &amp; Rose as their role models?  I do not recommend this  book for the weak hearted, it its very descriptive and shocking.	2000-07-26

Nothing was held back from this oral history, very detailed and fun.  Yvonne Ruskin did a great job, I felt like I knew these people and since I  have never been to Max's and now that it is gone it was alot of fun to see  what it was like and sad at the same time because I wish I could of been  there.	2000-07-26

I still wonder what will ever become of the children, what kind of people will they turn out to be?  The only problem I had with the book was the picture of  the baby, that haunts me,I kept trying to skip over it when looking through  the pics.  That I felt was not called for.	2000-07-26

This story haunted me for nights, very well written, very thourough details.  I feel so sorry for of course the victims but even more for their families.  Larry  Eyler died in prison of aids I'm not sure if he ever confessed.  There was  a conspiracy theory that he had an accomplice that has never been caught,   if anyone has any info let me know.	2000-07-25
