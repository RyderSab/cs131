It has characters with mysterious pasts whom you love to root for, disturbingly evil villains, and a scientific backdrop that is all too real.<br /><br />Great stuff! Looking forward to more Dun.	2005-10-01

Detroit Private Eye Ben Perkins was the coolest hero since Spenser--tough and funny, but also with amazing depth.<br /><br />The books (nine of them so far) are clever, with plenty of action, and they anticipated the trend that would continue with Robert Crais, Michael Connelly, and James Lee Burke, where the hero was as important as the story.<br /><br />Kantner quickly became a must-read in the mystery community, winning awards and gaining fans. I urge everyone to seek out HELL'S ONLY HALF FULL, which is one of the best PI novels ever written. The rest of his stuff is damn good too.<br /><br />Anyone who has read my books can easily spot the influence Kantner has had on my work. He's one of the reasons I became a writer.<br /><br />When I heard Rob was putting together a collection of Ben Perkins short stories, I got in touch and begged him to let me write the foreword. Rob, ever gracious, allowed me the honor.<br /><br />If you're a Kantner fan from way back, rejoice in this new collection. And if you've never read him before, you're in for a real treat.	2005-08-12

He's is a master at writing fiction that plays like a movie in your head. You hear the dialog. You see the brutality. And this movie is one hell of an adventure.<br /><br />A modern-day serial killer is following an M.O. that goes back thousands of years. The ensuing manhunt is full of twists and scares, playing out like a prehistoric episode of CSI.<br /><br />If you've never read Bonansinga before, this is the perfect opportunity to immerse yourself in his slightly perverse, somewhat twisted, and always entertaining world.	2005-08-08

Gordy is a great character, a perfect combination of pathos and humor, and I was rooting for him from the first chapter on.<br /><br />The lawyer aspects engaged me more than I would have expected---being a lawyer himself, Schaffer takes us through a trial that is both realistic and fascinating. This isn't TV melodrama; this is the real deal, described by a pro in layman's terms with a smattering of sarcastic wit.<br /><br />But beyond being a funny, compelling book, Misdemeanor Man also has real heart. Gordy's family life and romantic life are just as important to the reader as the against-all-odds case he must win, as is his affinity for Barry Manilow.<br /><br />It's a testament to Schaffer's writing that I actually revisted some of Manilow's greatets hits after reading the book. Sure, I may have downloaded them from a file-sharing network on Kazaa, but even the fact that I'm giving the guy a shot should be worth something.<br /><br />The sequel is going on my to-be-read pile, and Schaffer is now on my must-read list.<br /><br />If you like the Fletch series by Gregory McDonald, or the funny caper novels of Westlake, check this book out.	2005-08-07

What is the true nature of evil? Is it the sincere desire to do harm? Or is it lack of any desire at all?<br /><br />You'll find out in The Twelfth Card. Some of the action scenes are unforgettable, and Thompson Boyd will go down in history as one of the most unique, and scariest, killers in crime ficiton.<br /><br />As usual with a Deaver book, we're treated with some great forensic scenes, surprise twists, and insights into every character, majors and minors alike. Deaver's writing is seemless, and the highest compliment I can say is that his words don't get in the way of the story, unlike other, more verbose thriller writers.<br /><br />But it's Boyd's motivation, and the way he conducts his business, that takes the book up to that next level.<br /><br />Plus, I'll never think of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" in the same way again...	2005-07-11

STUFFED is one of them.<br /><br />A worthy follow-up to the cult fave PIPSQUEAK, STUFFED is even crazier, crammed full of moments where I almost hurt myself laughing. It's also a well done mystery, with a great ending.<br /><br />Searching for the perfect summer beach read? Look no further. Wiprud is a genius.	2005-07-07
US	51692288	RVWKHBDTXBJDL	0525948775	535890305	The Death Collectors	Books	5	10	10	N	N	another winner for Kerley	With his second novel, Kerley proves his thrilling debut THE HUNDREDTH MAN wasn't a fluke.<br /><br />Alabama PSIT Detective Carson Ryder is back. He's a likeable hero; self-depricating, determined, and smart, with enough of a sense of humor to help take the edge off of the horrors he witnesses.<br /><br />His insane, incarcerated brother Jeremy is again called upon to help Carson catch a killer, and their scenes together are among the best in the book. I've read reviews comparing the motif to Silence of the Lambs (the hero consulting the serial slayer), but in my opinion Jeremy is a much more believable and compelling psychopath than Hannibal Lecter. Creatures like Hannibal (the brilliant but insane psychiatrist) don't really exist. Creatures like Jeremy do exist, and there's a strange repulsion/attraction when reading about him.<br /><br />Great suspense, solid characters, and a nail-biter finale, all revolving around a very unusual group of collectors. First rate all the way. I expect that Kerley will be around for a long, long time.	2005-06-25

ONE SHOT is fast, exciting, sexy, fun, and totally unpredicatable, much like Reacher himself. I devoured it in one sitting.<br /><br />Haven't read Child yet? Once you read this, you'll be a fan for life. Read Child before? Then you know you're about to surrender yourself to a master at the peak of his talent.<br /><br />You'll be hooked on the first page.

More fun than the last several, in fact.<br /><br />There are numerous in-jokes to earlier Preston/Child novels, as well as some cast reunions and introductions. If you're a fan, you'll eat these moments up.<br /><br />The plot is frantic and intelligent, and you get the feeling they really enjoyed writing this one. Pendergast must stop his brilliant but insane brother Diogenes, who has spent the last decade constructing the perfect crime. And a doozy of a crime it is.<br /><br />The ending really smokes, the twists come fast and furious, and there are some smiles as well. Looking forward to the next in the series, which can't come fast enough.	2005-06-15

Gischler walks a peculiar tightrope between humor and satire.<br /><br />On the surface, you wonder if he's doing a parody of James Crumley, with an alcoholic loser hero, insanely over-the-top villains, and femme fatales amundo, all with a tongue-in-cheek style that makes the reader smile.<br /><br />But there's also graphic violence here. And graphic sex. And though the book is funny, it's never silly. Gischler respects the crime genre, and plays by the rules.<br /><br />The end result is a fast, fun read that will please Gischler's growing fan base and convert the non-believers.<br /><br />If you enjoy crime fiction, you'll enjoy Suicide Squeeze.<br /><br />If you don't enjoy crime fiction, why the hell are you bothering to read this review?	2005-05-31

Parker, you'd get something very similar to Still River.<br /><br />This book has got everything a PI novel needs. Tight writing that brilliantly exploits the Dallas setting, a stoic hero who dishes out heaping portions of justice and wisecracks, sex and gunfights and car chases and arms dealers and evil land developers and enough suspense and style to burn.<br /><br />Exciting, funny, and loaded with memorable characters, this is one of the best debuts of the year.<br /><br />If you like John Connolly, Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, Lee Child, Sara Paretsky, Ross MacDonald, Dennis Lehane, Harlan Coben, or Laura Lippman, check this book out.	2005-05-23

It's got tons of action, likeable characters, a brilliant concept, and a kick-butt ending that had me cheering.<br /><br />I'm afraid to start another book, because I know it won't measure up. It's that good.<br /><br />If you like Michael Crichton, Peter Benchley, Preston and Child, Clive Cussler, or Matt Reilly, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! Because once you do, you'll never be satisfied with them again.<br /><br />Thanks, Steve, for ruining my summer reading list.<br /><br />Now hurry up with your next book, please.	2005-05-11

Bowles doesn't lecture readers--he delights them with a witty tale told 'once upon a time' style, cleverly explaining how a savvy ruler can get the most from his followers through simple observation and easy-to-learn techniques.<br /><br />Besides being informative (and 100% on the money), Kingdomality also does something NO OTHER book on management has ever done. It entertains.<br /><br />When you finish the book, you've not only learned a great deal, but had more than a few laugh outloud chuckles, and too many smiles to count.<br /><br />Bowles proves that learning, even if you're a high-powered Fortune 500 executive, can be fun.<br /><br />Stephen Covey could take lessons from Sheldon Bowles.	2005-01-28

It has all the wit, weirdness, multi-layers, and creepy violence of their other books, along with the re-teaming their two best heroes, D'Agosta and Pendergast.<br /><br />If you're a fan of James Rollins, F.

I love books about serial killers (which is why the books I write have serial killers in them), and I try to read everything in this sub-genre.<br /><br />What struck me immediately about DDD was its playfulness--this book is fun. Dexter, though psychotic, is an amusing and sympathetic character. There were even moments where I laughed out loud.<br /><br />The plot--Dexter chasing a serial killer who is eerily similar to himself--kept me guessing up until the very end.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fun, fast read; one that will keep you up all night, check this book out.

The third book in Alten's MEG series once again finds prehistoric shark expert Jonas Taylor battling his greatest fear-- a modern day Megaladon. A Meg, for the uninitiated, is a 70 foot great white shark; an eating machine that can swallow Grizzly bears whole.<br />Jonas is much older than the last time he tangled with Megs. His marriage has lost its spark, his teenage daughter thinks he's a fool, and his primary motive in life is to pay bills. Enter Daredevils, a reality TV show that offers Jonas the two things he needs most; money and self-respect. All he needs to do is on-camera color commentary for their second season, which takes place aboard a replica Spanish galleon.<br />So once again, Jonas finds himself on the open ocean, and once again, monsters from his past come back to threaten him and his family. Like all Alten books, you care about the characters and their outcome, and like all Alten books, not everyone survives.<br />The action is fast paced and jaw-dropping, the story moves along like a tsunami, and the ending will leave you utterly exhausted. Alten is one of the best suspense writers in the world, and this is him in top form. Knowledge of the first two novels in this series, MEG and THE TRENCH, isn't necessary to enjoy PRIMAL WATERS, but once you read this one you'll want to grab those anyway.<br />PRIMAL WATERS is the ultimate beach read... if you have the guts read it near the water.	2004-07-16

HANNIBAL is a bad book. I can't think of a single  complimentary thing to say about this novel... isn't Thomas Harris a thriller writer? This book is without thrills. It turns the greatest villain of the century into a hero, and then drops him into a bad James Bondish plot (cybernetic pedophile without a face conspires to use pigs to eat off Lector's feet?!?) Endless Italy travelogue, Starling wasted, no Will Graham, needless lesbian mayhem...<br /><br />This should have been the greatest book of the decade, instead it was a bitter pill to swallow.
