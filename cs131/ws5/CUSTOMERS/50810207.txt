So, it's a cheesy story.  Formulaic, too, since almost all of Kenyon's heroes are carbon cutouts of one another: tough, tormented men with supernatural abilities and tortured pasts who somehow always manage to save the day from (seemingly) undefeatable enemies and hardships.    But I guess that's why I keep reading these books.  They're familiar and entertaining, no matter how cheesy.  I mean, I knew the moment I started reading NIGHT PLAY, it was going to suck me in, and nothing was going to keep me from finishing it, not even the need to sleep or go to the bathroom.    So, much like a drug, Kenyon's books are addictive - they're not necessarily good for you, but you can't stop from buying more and more!    Anyway, enough with the rant.  Back to NIGHT PLAY.      This is the story of Were-Hunter Vane, who you may remember as the werewolf in NIGHT EMBRACE.  If you have never read NIGHT EMBRACE, I suggest you back up and read that book first.  In fact, start the DARK-HUNTER series in order, beginning with its prologue FANTASY LOVER (about Julian), and going to NIGHT PLEASURES (Kyrian), NIGHT EMBRACE (Talon), DANCE WITH THE DEVIL (Zarek), KISS OF THE NIGHT (Wulf), and then NIGHT PLAY.  You're better off, as you will understand secondary characters, background, and inside jokes a lot better.    Vane initially met his heroine, Bride, in NIGHT EMBRACE, and their attraction brings them together in NIGHT PLAY.  I like Vane as a hero.  Being a wolf most of the time, he is totally clueless as to how humans interact, and that gives him a nice vulnerability that many past DARK-HUNTER heroes lacked.  Plus, he's genuinely a good guy.  He's not a jerk off, he has nothing to prove, and he's kind to animals and his own family members.  In fact, he's now one of my favorite characters, which includes Ash, Simi, and Zarek.    Bride is an interesting lady.  I've never read about a size-18 heroine before, especially one who is self-conscious about everything.  I liked the fact that Vane loved her immediately for who she is (and Kenyon was very convincing in showing why and how he could love her).  I'm not sure I liked her myself.  The one thing she said that really bugged me was how impressed she was that Vane was \\"loaded.\\"  To me, it's tacky to bring up finances right from the start of a relationship.  It's also shallow.      Anyway, Vane and Bride get involved, and then Vane's various family members begin hunting him down for the crime of being alive.  There's a little bit of time travel involved, and of course, there is Ash and his many interesting predictions.      Altogether, it was an entertaining story - though it did have some cheesy dialogue, etc.  So it's not perfect.  But it's enjoyable.  And it makes you want to read more.  Now I have to go buy SEIZE THE NIGHT (about Valerius).  Arrgh!	2005-10-11

It is an easy-to-read narrative about the real-life environment and adventures of the first pirates of the Caribbean - and it's written by a 17th-century buccaneer!  <br /> <br />The first part of the book concentrates on describing how the buccaneering lifestyle was established, as well as included an in-depth description of the flora and fauna of Tortuga and Hispaniola.  Having been to the Dominican Republic on Hispaniola, I really appreciated the rich detail and history of what the island was like in the 17th century.  I can't believe Hispaniola had so many animals back then - if you go there today, you'll find all the wildlife was killed for food long, long ago. <br /> <br />The second part of the book mostly covers the exploits of Henry Morgan, probably the most famous buccaneer of them all.  One of the fascinating chapters is about the sack of Panama, which includes all the hardships the buccaneers endured in order to pillage Spanish cities and fortresses. <br /> <br />This was a neat little book that kept my attention from chapter one onward.  I also stopped quite often just to read different passages aloud.  If you are going to travel to the Dominican Republic or Haiti, I'd recommend reading this book or taking it along as your \\"beach book.\\"  It's too bad there aren't really any touring trips to Tortuga, the infamous pirate haven that is referred to quite often in BUCCANEERS OF AMERICA, as it is nowadays an uninhabited island. <br /> <br />The only part of this book I didn't enjoy was the Introduction, which was pretty dry to read.  If you bypass it completely and just start with the first chapter, you'll be fine! <br /> <br />***Another fascinating pirate book to read is UNDER THE BLACK FLAG by David Cordingly.**** <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

The plotline sounded interesting - a biologist finds a new species of frog, only to discover he's really a 1,000-year old cursed Welsh prince - but the story is so horribly written, I could barely stomach it.  Characters from the medieval times use modern jargon like \\"Okay.\\"  Phrases like \\"his booming laugh splashed water onto the hard white floor\\" made no sense.  Other phrases like \\"swollen peaks of desire\\" were just dumb.  The author also constantly misused the word \\"insure,\\" on top of other terrible grammatical mistakes.  Where was the editor?  What was Love Spell thinking, publishing this mess?     The heroine is not endearing.  She is supposed to be a scientist (meaning, we're supposed to believe her intelligent), yet she acts like a complete moron.  For instance, she freaks about about the fact that the hero spends the first third of the book naked (especially since she has a fiance hanging around), yet she doesn't immediately try to clothe him.  She doesn't even offer a blanket.  It takes her several days before she finally buys him some clothes at the store.  Then, instead of being discreet and purchasing clothes in another city, she purchases clothes in the local men's garment shop, which of course gives the town snoop something to gossip about.  Come on!    That's just one example.  I don't even want to go near the \\"moral\\" struggle the heroine supposedly has.  In fact, there's just too much to complain about regarding this book.  I don't have to time or desire to go into it.  I'd rather forget this book existed.    Listen, I too purchased this book from amazon thinking that the negative critics were probably being too harsh.  I thought it would be worth my time reading it, just because the premise sounded cute.  The book sucked.  Really.  This publisher usually puts out good books, so I'm shocked.  And disappointed.  I would give KISSING FROGS zero stars if possible, and I never have felt that nasty toward a book before (not even after reading Christine Feehan's awful DARK PRINCE).     If you want a good story, read something else, anything else.  My idea of a witty, fantastic, well-written paranormal romance would be BREATH OF MAGIC by Teresa Medeiros, IMAGINE by Jill Barnett, or KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR by Jude Deveraux.	2005-09-25

It didn't let me down!  In UNDEAD AND UNEMPLOYED, foul-mouthed airhead Betsy Taylor continues her antics as the reluctant vampire queen, this time by getting a dream job in the shoe department as Macys.  In the meantime, she has to figure out who is killing vampires in her city.  Of course, she's accompanied by her human friends and her vamp archenemy, namely that hottie Eric Sinclair. <br /> <br />I read this book in just a few hours, non-stop.  It was light and fun, and it made me laugh.  It's not a perfect book - for one, the bad guy was obvious - but it still got me anxious to read the next one!  Betsy is just hysterical, in my opinion. <br /> <br />Just so you know, this isn't really a romance.  It's part of an ongoing series about the crazy antics of a whiny, vain, slightly idiotic designer-shoe aficionado who is not only a vampire, but a vampire queen.  The book does have its erotic moments, however.  Sinclair is a yummy vampire king. <br /> <br />Anyway, if you are interested, begin the series in order, starting with UNDEAD AND UNWED, then read Davidson's short story \\"Dead Girls Can't Dance\\" in the anthology CRAVINGS, which features Betsy and Sinclair. Then read this book (UNDEAD AND UNEMPLOYED), followed by UNDEAD AND UNAPPRECIATED and UNDEAD AND UNRETURNABLE. <br />	2005-09-22

It is the story of vain airhead Betsy Taylor, who is run over by a car and ends up a vampire - but not just any vampire, but the foretold vampire queen.  While Betsy is dealing with the ick factor of drinking blood and meeting loser vampires, she's also trying to expand her designer shoe collection and not fall for the charms of a sexy, dangerous vampire who gets on her nerves and drives her up the wall.    UNDEAD AND UNWED can be found in the romance section, but I wouldn't call it a traditional romance.  For one, it's in first-person narrative.  Two, it isn't your typical hero-heroine get together story; in fact, Betsy ends the book feeling the same way towards Sinclair as she felt when she first met him: he's hot and she's hot for him, but he's still a rat bastard.  So don't expect a happily-ever-after ending.  Third, the sex in this book is ... different.  Very different.  I was shocked, actually, by most of it.  Not necessarily in a bad way, but still shocked.  Fourth, the book is first in a series.  Granted, it's an entertaining, laugh-out-loud (snort your milk out through your nose) kind of series.  The kind in which you hope there are lots and lots of sequels.    Anyway, I highly recommend UNDEAD AND UNWED.  It's one of the most enjoyable vampire books I've read in a long time (and I've read everything from Anne Rice to Christine Feehan).      If you like UNDEAD AND UNWED, then read Davidson's short story \\"Dead Girls Can't Dance\\" in the anthology CRAVINGS, which features Betsy and Sinclair.  Then look out for UNDEAD AND UNEMPLOYED, UNDEAD AND UNAPPRECIATED, and UNDEAD AND UNRETURNABLE.  Have fun!	2005-09-21

Topics include the design, origins, and conversion of pirate ships; small vessels and pirate flagships; and the pirate ship in action.  The narration is easy to read and nicely detailed, and of course the main subject of the book is the pirate ship itself.  One of my favorite passages was the real-life entry of a pirate-attack survivor, who talked about how his merchant ship engaged in bloody combat with pirates while (shockingly) two other merchant ships looked on, doing nothing to help.     <br /> <br />What you won't find in this book ... I knew this book wasn't about the pirates themselves, as there are other books in this series written by this author that exclusively discuss pirates (or buccaneers).  What I HAD hoped for, and didn't find, was a discussion about what living in a pirate ship was like (where did they eat, sleep, use the restroom, etc.?).  As a side note, the closest I've ever come to seeing what life aboard a pirate ship might have been like was visiting the Vasa Museum in Stockholm, Sweden, which has a restored 17th century warship and includes a display on life inside the ship.  It's a neat museum.   <br /> <br />Anyway, this was a good little book for those interested in pirate ships.  A recent pirate book I read and highly recommend is UNDER THE BLACK FLAG, which was rather entertaining for non-fiction.     <br />	2005-09-19

I sure do, having been fascinated by pirates since I was a little girl.  In the nonfiction book UNDER THE BLACK FLAG, author David Cordingly debunks the pirate myth to tell us what real 17th and 18th century pirates were like: uneducated, drunken seamen who were very young and very violent.   <br /> <br />Writing in a clear, easy-to-read style, Cordingly explores pirate life (mostly within the Caribbean), from historical raids to shipwrecks,  pirate loot, and executions.  There's even a chapter about female pirates.   <br /> <br />I found this entire book fascinating, and read it as quickly as I would read a fiction novel.  Moreover, I often stopped to read aloud certain passages to family members, just because the passages were so interesting and full of historical significance.  For instance, I had no idea that pirates sacked Panama or that an earthquake completely destroyed Port Royal in Jamaica, a big-time pirate hang-out.  The most popular passages, however, were the descriptions of exceptionally nasty (yet curiously inventive) means of torture carried out by sadistic pirate captains on their poor victims.  You have to read it to believe it!   <br /> <br />Anyway, UNDER THE BLACK FLAG is quite an eye-opening experience.  It's history and adventure and fascinating biographies all rolled into one.  Highly recommended!	2005-09-15

I cannot believe that I left TRAVELER by Melanie Jackson sitting on my bookshelf for months, ignored, in favor of reading other romantic paranormals.  What an idiot I was!  This book is a jewel among paranormal romances!  It has fantastic characters, a fascinating storyline, and a creative setting.  The best part is that Jackson can write - and I mean well!  I cannot stop raving about this book. <br /> <br />The hero, Jack Frost, is sent in by the police to find out what dirty deeds the flesh-eating goblins are up to in Goblin Town.  Jack happens to be a death fey, meaning he has potent death magic up his sleeve.  At the same time, an underground organization called HUG is sending in Io, a siren fey, to intercept Jack and find out what he knows.  Jack and Io meet, the attraction flares, and from that point on, they work together on a dangerous mission to stop an evil goblin from exterminating the human species. <br /> <br />The alternate world that Jackson creates is fantastic.  Goblin City comes alive in all its ugly weirdness.  Jack and Io's magic spells are also fun; in many ways, the magic itself becomes a secondary character.  I love the easy dialogue between these two, as well as their relationship.  You can practically see these two fall in love.  And it's not fast or cheesy.  Plus, this book is NOT sex scene after sex scene, interspersed with minimal (or stupid) plot, as many other romances are.  No, it actually has a great plot, which keeps you reading.  You WANT to know what happens next in Goblin Town. <br /> <br />Of course, the book is not perfect.  Some reviewers complain the first chapter is confusing, which could be true.  Certainly, it is almost all talk and no action, as it tries to explain the dynamics of humans, half-feys, and goblins within this alternate world.  Also, I would have liked to see Jack use more of his death magic ... but that's not so much a complaint as it is curiosity. <br /> <br />Anyway, if you are looking for a good, engaging read, try this book.  TRAVELER is one of those stories that tickle the imagination.  It is also the first in a series.  The next book is called OUTSIDERS (supposedly, the hero is a dragon).  I can't wait to read it! <br /> <br />***For a similar read, try Emma Holly's erotic THE DEMON'S DAUGHTER.  It is also set in an alternate world, which is sort of like Victorian England.*** <br /> <br />	2005-09-10

What I liked best about this book was how it wrapped-up at the end, explaining that Carly's time-travel was no fluke, but rather the fate of two soul mates.      What I didn't like was the author's \\"tell, don't show\\" approach, in which we are told that Carly becomes friends with all the pirates and that Carly and Andrew are falling in love, but doesn't devote any initial scenes showing it.  That's why I really didn't believe it the first time Andrew thought he was falling in love with her.  Why would he?  There was nothing in their interactions that screamed \\"love\\"; maybe lust (she's the only female on the ship, for crying out loud), but not love.      Any way, I liked Andrew.  He was a sweet hero - too, sweet, perhaps for a man who is supposed to be a pirate - but definitely a good guy to root for.  Carly's interesting as a heroine, though I personally didn't like her.  She comes across as tough, for she is a navy pilot, yet her insecurities, as well as her sob story about why she hates rich men, bugged me rather than made me feel sympathetic.      Overall, the book is an entertaining read.  It'll keep you interested.  As time-traveling romances go, it's original with its pirate theme.  However, time-traveling aside, I don't think it's realistic.  Pirates weren't that nice and lovable.  Nor did I believe in Andrew and Carly's love.  But that's just me.      ***For those interested in time-traveling romances, A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR by Jude Devereaux is probably the best one I've ever read.  Period.  Also look for BREATH OF MAGIC by Theresa Medeiros or THE AUTUMN LORD by Susan Sizemore.  All three are fabulous books.  Oh, and if you want to read about real pirates, try the nonfiction book UNDER THE BLACK FLAG by David Cordingly.  It's eye-opening!***	2005-09-01

In fact, it ranks high on my list of all-time favorites.      Both the hero and heroine in SKYPIRATE were appealing and multi-dimensional.  Dax the skypirate was sexy, brave, and goodhearted - while his guilt and fears made him human.  The slave, Califa, was strong despite the trials she endured.  Not only was she a sympathetic heroine, but she was also someone you could root for.  Neither character left you with a sense that they were too good to be true.  They each had their faults, and were likable because of it.    The storyline also kept my attention.  Basically, Dax unintentionally saves Califa, his enemy, from a dastardly fate, and she helps him discover the fate of his people, who were almost completely annihilated by the evil Coalition.  Califa finds herself falling in love with Dax.  The problem is, she was once an esteemed Officer in the Coalition, which had destroyed his planet and enslaved his people.    I pretty much enjoyed everything about this story.  It was touching and action-packed, as well as satisfying regarding both the love affair and overall conclusion.  In fact, I don't have any criticisms.  My only suggestion, however, is that you read its prequel, LORD OF THE STORM, first.  Califa plays a pivotal role in LORD OF THE STORM, which is referred to often in THE SKYPIRATE.  In addition, in LORD OF THE STORM, you get the opportunity to see the \\"old\\" Califa (uncaring Coalition officer) versus the \\"new\\" Califa (now an escaped slave and freedom fighter) featured in THE SKYPIRATE.      Since both books are out of print, you'll have to buy them used.  Don't worry - they are worth the effort!      **For similar reads, look for the sci-fi romances WARRIOR'S WOMAN by Johanna Lindsey or SHIELDER by Catherine Spangler.**	2005-08-24

If I had to describe it in one word, I'd use \\"cheesy.\\"  Of course, that didn't mean that it wasn't entertaining to read.  I finished it up in a few hours.  Most of that time, I was snorting out loud at something or other I found ridiculous.  Still, I finished the book in record time.  Who knows, I might even read it again.  It wasn't bad.  Just ... cheesy. <br /> <br />The gist of the story is that Grimm, a 16th century Highlander, is a Berserker - a legendary fighter with supernatural strength.  He's in love with a laird's daughter named Jillian, but he's afraid to be with her, for fear that he will harm her like his father killed his mother.  Jillian, of course, doesn't know his secrets, and has embarrassed herself in her lifelong pursuit of him.  She thinks her love is unrequited.  Her father, who knows better, tries to force Grimm to admit his love by setting up Grimm against two other suitors for Jillian's hand in marriage. <br /> <br />So what did I think was so cheesy about this book?  First, even though it is set in the 1500s, no one acts like they are in the 1500s.  Jillian makes comments like \\"a lass has got to do what a lass has got to do\\" and uses modern slang like \\"stupid.\\"  Her parents also want her to marry for love.  Most noble families married off their girls at young ages in political alliances during this time period.  Jillian is in her 20s and gets to choose between numerous suitors.  That's a little too unrealistic. <br /> <br />Second, Jillian has three men fighting for her affection.  However, I never felt the other suitors would actually steal her heart, even though the author tried hard to create a mystery surrounding it.  Plus, the only \\"tense\\" scene in which Jillian almost gets married to the wrong man was more trite than nerve-wracking, as the author informed us several pages ahead of time thatGrimm was going to save the day. <br /> <br />There were other things that bugged me, that made me feel like this book was a pedestrian effort.  I won't go into any more detail, but I do want to point out that the Grimm in this book was inconsistent his character in the prequel, BEYOND THE HIGHLAND MIST.  For one thing, I never once saw any hints that Grimm had magical abilities or was anything special in BEYOND.  Also, I thought Hawk in BEYOND was Grimm's best friend.  In TO TAME, Quinn is named as Grimm's best friend.  It's little inconsistencies like that made my reading experience less enjoyable. <br /> <br />Anyway, on the bright side, I liked Grimm as a character.  He endeared himself to me with his treatment of his scarred horse and the half-blind boy.  I also like his real name, Gavrael.  Very sexy and original. <br /> <br />Overall, TO TAME A HIGHLAND WARRIOR is entertaining, if corny.  It is book number two in the Highlander series, which has some worthwhile reads (DARK HIGHLANDER is my favorite).  I'd say go ahead and read it.  Just don't take it seriously, and you'll be fine. <br />	2005-08-24

The paranormal romance KNIGHT OF A TRILLION STARS by Dara Joy was laugh-out-loud funny at times, as well as engrossing and entertaining.   <br /> <br />To summarize, modern-day Deanna discovers a gorgeous, magical alien in her living room one miserable day, and he ends up marrying her without her realizing it and brings her to another time, in another dimension, on another planet, to complete a quest to save the universe.   <br /> <br />Lorgin was different hero ... sweetly unbearable, hysterically self-assured and affectionate ... to Deanna's never-ending frustration.  The different worlds that he takes Deanna to were rather creative; kudos to the author on her vivid imagination!  I also liked the two secondary characters who go on the quest with Lorgin and Deanna, namely the shape-shifting Familiar Rejar (hot!) and the ice-cold Traed (in some ways, even hotter!).  I couldn't help wonder if they stole the show.... <br /> <br />On the negative side, the book was vague in some respects and anti-climactic in others.  I'm still not sure why Deanna had to be married to Lorgin and why she was the chosen one (what, exactly, were her magic powers anyway?).  I also thought the final confrontation wrapped-up a little too quickly, as if the author was rushing to meet a deadline.  Oh, and something else ... I thought it incredibly silly that Lorgin expected Deanna to see how much he loved her because he had (drum roll, please) oral sex with her.  Snicker, snicker. <br /> <br />Still, I enjoyed this book immensely, and am looking forward to reading its sequel, REJAR.  This was definitely a \\"joy\\" to read. <br /> <br />***For a similar read, try VIRTUAL HEAVEN by Ann Lawrence or THE STONE PRINCE by Gena Showalter.*** <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-24

When I first heard about it, I couldn't wait to read it.  After all, the hero, Nathan, is a gargoyle.  I thought to myself, how clever and original!  Then I read it....    First of all, I really did like how the author played with the idea of a gargoyle hero.  She created an interesting history about a race of men cursed with the ability to shape-shift into gruesome creatures with the express purpose of helping mankind.  That alone was worth reading about.    But there were problems with the book.  For one, the book is called CARVED IN STONE, and Nathan is described by the heroine as having a earthy, rocky scent.  Yet these gargoyles don't turn into stone, and there's no other stone connection at all.  That was bizarre ... and a little disappointing.    Some things I also found disappointing were the love scenes, which didn't come across as sensual to me.  Maybe it was the language.  I know that the term \\"hand job\\" jarred me when I read it.  It was a little too crude for me.      Also, the first \\"heroine in danger/hero saves her\\" scene with the \\"hood\\" in the bar was cheesy.  In the middle of a fight, in which the \\"hood\\" is holding a knife to her throat while Nathan threatens him, Rachel actually rolls her eyes and makes a caustic comment about having better things to do that day than listen to their pissing contest.  I was the one rolling my eyes then.  I just can't take the story seriously if the author doesn't try to attempt a little realism when it comes to human interactions.    Another issue is that the ending to the story doesn't wrap things up, plot-wise.  In fact, you have to read the next book, FLESH AND STONE, to find out who the \\"bad guys\\" are that threatened Nathan and his fellow gargoyles in CARVED IN STONE.  I find that rather unsatisfying.    Going back to the plot ... well, let's just say the plot rambled around a bit.  It starts off with Rachel, an Interpol officer, trying to track a killer, then veers off to her tracking down a gargoyle who killed the killer, then veers off to strangers trying to kill the gargoyles.  All the while, Nathan and Rachel fall in love, even though he's one of the monsters she's trying to destroy.    Anyway, for me, CARVED IN STONE is a so-so book, saved only by the fact that the hero is a gargoyle.  It was interesting to read, as well as fast paced.  I finished it quickly.  Unfortunately, I couldn't get into it.  There were too many things that put me off (including the contrived ending).  Still, I'm planning to read the next book, in hopes that the writing will improve.  After all, the concept fascinates me.  Gargoyles.  Very cool idea.  Just wish the book was better executed.    ***For those who like shapeshifter romances, the best I've ever read are about werewolves.  Try TO CATCH A WOLF by Susan Krinard or KILLING MOON by Rebecca York.  Or, try THE SELKIE by Melanie Jackson, which is a solid romance about a man who is half-seal.***	2005-08-24
US	50810207	R1NQ7TRQKB4SAE	0515138150	81264330	Cravings	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Four Erotic Stories about the Undead and the Cursed	CRAVINGS is a collection of four erotic paranormal stories, of which one story I thought was fantastic, two were decent, and one was a straight-out bust.  Here's my opinion:<br /><br />\\"Blood Upon My Lips\\" is by featured author Laurell K. Hamilton and appears to be an excerpt from one of her Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, novels.  Having never read an Anita Blake novel, I can't really judge if this story was good or bad in comparison.  I can say, however, that this story killed any interest I might have had in reading her novels.  Personally, I don't like heroines who are mannish in nature (I found it bizarre she wore a tux to a wedding).  More importantly, I don't like heroines who sleep around.  In this story, she has 3 current boyfriends, meets up with another guy she had sex with once, and gets hot and heavy in a threesome with another two guys.  Sorry, but that bothered me ... in the WRONG way!  Too many other things about this story creeped me out, so I'm giving it a 1-star rating.<br /><br />\\"Dead Girls Don't Dance\\" by MaryJanice Davidson had the opposite effect - now I can't wait to read the rest of her UNDEAD series.  This particular story was about how young vampire Andrea meets up with an old college flame (a deliciously dopey human stud) and then, together, set out to meet the new Vampire Queen.  The Queen was hysterical!  The story itself was beyond cute and had attitude.  I'm now a fan.  Rating: 5 stars.<br /><br />\\"Originally Human\\" by Eileen Wilkes grew on me.  I wasn't sure if I was going to like it at first ... however, the moment I found out the heroine was a succubus, I got into it.  In essence, the story revolves around what happens when a beautiful young man with no memory suddenly appears injured at Molly's feet.  Molly is the succubus, of course.  Because the ending was rather vague, as well as the bad guys, I'm giving this story 3 stars.<br /><br />\\"Burning Moon\\" by Rebecca York was the reason I bought this anthology, since I'm a fan of her werewolf series.  This particular story features werewolf Grant Marshall, whose mate was murdered.  Now he's hunting the killer.  What I liked about this story was the fact that Antonia, the heroine, was a blind tarot card reader.  I also liked that Grant was grieving hard over the loss of his mate.  What I didn't like was the cheesy ending, in which they fall in love so quickly.  Oh well.  This one got 4 stars.<br /><br />If you are interested in MaryJanice Davidson's books, the vampire series begins with UNDEAD AND UNWED.  For Rebecca York's werewolf novels, the series begins with KILLING MOON.f her werewolf series.  This particular story features werewolf Grant Marshall, whose mate was murdered.  Now he's hunting the killer.  What I liked about this story was the fact that Antonia, the heroine, was a blind tarot card reader.

It was entertaining and action-packed, and included appearances from favorite characters like Zarek, Julian, and (yummy!) Acheron.   <br /> <br />The plot of KISS OF THE NIGHT revolves around the Viking Wulf Tryggvasen, whom nobody can remember five minutes after meeting him.  Wulf, a Dark-Hunter, saves Cassandra Peters from a Daimon attack, only to discover that Cassandra is a Apollite - one of a race that Wulf hunts and kills to protect humanity from is evilness.  Not only is she the enemy, but she is also the last direct descendant of the Greek God Apollo, so if she dies, the whole world will die with her.  As if that's not enough, Wulf and Cassandra become lovers - with some interesting results. <br /> <br />As a Dark-Hunter novel, it wasn't one of my favorites.  While it made the Daimons more interesting in that it \\"humanized\\" them through Cassandra's point of view, I felt the overall story was rushed.  I also would have appreciated more background and detail about other characters that played important roles in the story, such as Kat, Urian, and Stryker.  Kat was a big enigma to me, especially since Acheron didn't know who she was (I also was curious about the identity of her father).  Speaking of Acheron, I read this book with the express purpose of seeing him, so I was disappointed that he only played a small role in the end. <br /> <br />Also, going back to the background issue ... Kenyon played up the hero's backgrounds big time in her last 4(5) books, letting us \\"see\\" how they lived, who they loved, how they died, etc.  Wulf's past wasn't brought up much.  I wish it had been, since he was tricked into giving up his soul by the Norse god, Loki.  I'm a big fan of Norse mythology, so I would have LOVED to have seen Loki play a role in the story.  After all, he owns Wulf's soul.  But he never appeared.  Not once.  That surprises me, since Kenyon loves to write about the gods. <br /> <br />Anyway, if you are a Dark-Hunter fan, you'll find this book fascinating just for the detail it gives you about the Daimons.  If you've never read a Dark-Hunter novel, DON'T start with this one, for you will be confused.  It' best you read the books in order, beginning with FANTASY LOVER, NIGHT PLEASURES, NIGHT EMBRACE, DANCE WITH THE DEVIL (the best one, in my opinion), and KISS OF THE NIGHT. <br /> <br />	2005-07-30

It's the story of Princess Arianne who, in order to free her 12 brothers from a curse, must remain absolutely silent while she knits 12 shirts out of nettles.  It's a daunting task made all the more difficult when Richard, King of Avalon, stumbles into her life one day and sets out to make her his mistress.    What did I like about this book?  Lots of things!  First, the author writes with a witty attitude, making it fun to read.  Second, both Arianne and Richard are lovable characters, especially when they're irritated.  Arianne can't say anything, so Richard has to do all the talking - and it's cute, since he's something of an ego-maniac, yet charming, young king.  It's also fun to watch Richard go from lusty to loving (and jealous) through the course of the book.    The only thing I didn't like about the book were its constant references to John Paul (Richard's pet name for his privates), which was a little immature.  However, it didn't deter from the story, which was rather sweet, as romances go.    I finished this book within 3 or 4 hours, so it's a quick, entertaining read.  Too bad it's out-of-print.  Still, I think it's worth it to locate the book.  I'd definitely reread it again!    **For those interested in fairy tale romances, try CHARMING THE PRINCE or THE BRIDE AND THE BEAST by Theresa Medeiros.***	2005-07-29
US	50810207	R1BNSPPVP5F68W	0843955287	21482417	Dark Prince (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 1)	Books	1	215	240	N	N	This Vampire Romance Needed an Editor ... and a Plot	I had expected to enjoy the vampire romance, DARK PRINCE, by Christine Feehan, having read so many raving reviews about it.  However, I should have paid closer to attention to the reviewers who termed the book \\"repetitive\\" and \\"boring,\\" as I agree wholeheartedly on both accounts.      The gist of the story, in one sentence, is that Carpathian vampire prince Mikhail finds his life mate, a human woman with telepathic abilities, all the while battling evil vampire hunters determined to exterminate his kind.    It took me 3 weeks to finish 314-page DARK PRINCE, and that is abnormal for me, since I usually finish a book within hours.  It felt like torture, reading this book, and I only made myself finish because I always wonder if it might get better.  It did not.    So what are some of my grievances?      Well, for one, there is no tension in the book.  Mikhail and Raven are in love right from the start, and have sex like 5 or 6 times by page 100.  Where is the conflict in that?  Why should I continue reading it?  Well, apparently the author felt the laughable subplot in which Carpathian vampires are being hunted by vampire slayers was actually interesting.  Sorry, no.  The vampire slayers (repeatedly referred to as fanatical assassins) are a bunch of one-dimensional characters who die so fast it's not worthwhile to remember their names.  They don't make for interesting or compelling villains.    Two, this book was in dire need of an editor.  How many times does the author need to refer to Mikhail's predatory movements and muscular body or to Raven's innocence and compassion?  Other phrases that became grossly overused included \\"little one,\\" \\"her narrow rib cage,\\" \\"her large blue eyes,\\" \\"her large blue-violet eyes,\\" \\"silky hair,\\" \\"his voice was black-velvet seduction,\\" \\"I'm an American,\\" \\"I'm intelligent,\\" and (my personal favorite) \\"I have brains.\\"  Yes, we all do, thank you.    Three, Raven was a stupid heroine.  The whole book was mostly exposition in which she is arguing with Mikhail about everything and everyone, punctuated with my favorite idiotic repetitions of \\"I'm intelligent\\" and \\"I have brains.\\"  No you don't, not when you throw yourself in danger at every single turn, resulting in near-death experiences for you and the people around you.  The ONLY time I thought this book was interesting was when Raven was stabbed five times in the gut.  I was so happy!  And that is really, really sad.    So, as you can see, I pretty much loathed this book.    Now, interestingly, my paperback copy of DARK PRINCE came with a \\"bonus\\" 150-page short story called DARK DESCENT, which I was very, very reluctant to read at first.  Luckily, that story had a plot and lots of action, plus interesting characters, so I finished it in about 2 hours.  DARK DESCENT is about how Joie, an American bodyguard and psychic, goes exploring in a cave and discovers her Carpathian life mate, Traian, as well as a bunch of really nasty evil vampires who want to kill them.  While the story had its super-cheesy moments (why do people feel compelled to call vampires \\"blood suckers\\"?), it still was fast-paced and interesting, much more interesting than DARK PRINCE.  So at least I didn't completely waste $7.99 on the book.	2005-07-28
US	50810207	R1L1B2PJG7RXE6	0439784549	162568542	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	The Half-Blood Prince Is More Important than You Think	I decided to wait a few days after finishing HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE (Book Six) before writing a review, just to give myself time to recover from the cliffhanger-like ending.  Some people loved this book; others hated it.  I personally thought it was engrossing and read it within a 24-hour period.   <br /> <br />It's true that the book is more about Voldemort's history than anything else, but I enjoyed that aspect of it completely.  In fact, I started to feel sympathetic toward him.  To me, good-versus-evil stories are much more fascinating when there are shades of gray; in PRINCE, Rowling went out of her way to give Voldemort a rich background and complexity not seen in the first 5 books.  He is no longer just \\"the evil character,\\" but a \\"real\\" character now.  In that regard, Snape is growing as well.  In PRINCE, Harry learns some things about him that are just shocking.  The one that stands out most vividly in my mind is Harry's unwitting realization that he looked upon Snape as a friend (surely Rowling did not write that as an accident).  While Snape has almost always come across as Harry's nemesis, I have to agree with Dumbledore that Snape isn't as evil or suspicious as everyone thinks he is, no matter what happened in PRINCE.  Rather, he's become one of the most intriguing characters in the Potter series.  I'm so looking forward to seeing what happens between Snape and Harry in Book Seven. <br /> <br />Anyway, here's a couple wrap-up thoughts on PRINCE.  First and foremost, I'd recommend that people reread ORDER OF THE PHOENIX (Book 5) before reading PRINCE, since there are many secondary characters/plot elements from PHOENIX that are mentioned or pop up randomly in PRINCE.  Also, it must be remembered that Harry and his friends are teenagers now, so Harry (realistically) still suffers from a little angst, while everyone else is going girl or boy crazy.  Finally, this is the darkest book in the series so far, though it does have its laugh-out-loud comic moments.  In fact, PRINCE does depart a bit from the standard Potter storyline (for instance, we don't see too much of the Dursleys or Quidditch), but that's fine.  The books are maturing with Harry, and Harry has a lot more to worry about than grumpy relatives or playing games.   <br /> <br />All in all, I think PRINCE was a fascinating read, not only in that it provoked new reactions and feelings about certain characters, but it also has made me ridiculously anxious to read the final book in the series.  Please, Ms. Rowling, write it soon! <br /> <br />	2005-07-19
US	50810207	R3KUMNDT0VOLXU	1930709323	380673421	Goddess By Mistake	Books	3	8	8	N	N	Schoolteacher Loves a Centaur: Fantasy or Romance?	I really enjoyed the first half of GODDESS BY MISTAKE by P.C. Cast, thinking it an intriguing idea and refreshingly original; unfortunately, this fantasy-romance novel lost its tension (and, sadly, my interest) in the second half of the book, making it something of an effort to finish.    First, the good: GODDESS BY MISTAKE is the first-person narration of Oklahoma school teacher Shannon Parker, who is sent into an alternate world in which everyone believes she is Rhiannon, goddess incarnate and follower of Epona, a Celtic goddess of war and horses.  To complicate matters further, Shannon/Rhiannon is immediately married to ClanFintan, a centaur shaman with the ability to shape-shift.  I LOVED this idea.  It was fascinating to see Shannon/Rhiannon adjust to her role as goddess incarnate and deal with the fact that she's expected to mate with a man who is half horse.  The author writes with a funny sense of humor, and I was giggling wildly at the thought of wondering how Shannon/Rhiannon was going to deal with it all.    Now, the bad: What interested me upfront about the relationship between Shannon/Rhiannon and the centaur was the fact that there was heavy tension between them.  A good romance novel feeds off of that tension until the very end.  Which makes me wonder if GODDESS was supposed to be a romance novel because, unfortunately, the two lovers fell in love immediately, killing all the tension by the middle of the book (their major love scene was also pretty tame).  From that point on, the centaur is left with nothing else to do in the story but give his wife massages and fight the bad guys (everybody else is fighting the bad guys, too, so this is nothing special).    Speaking of the bad guys, the book is mostly about the good guys battling the bad guys (demon-vampire creatures), making it feel like it is more fantasy than romance.  I wasn't interested in that.  Sigh.    Anyway, this is the second P.C. Cast book I've read, the other being GODDESS OF THE SEA.  Inoticed that in both books, the hero is pretty much a secondary character, and his undying love is given upfront and guaranteed.  All the so-called tension is supposed to come from \\"bad\\" characters.  If you don't mind this, then I am sure you will enjoy GODDESS BY MISTAKE, for it is an interesting and creative fantasy.  But if you are like me and are looking for a delicious, page-turning ROMANCE with steamy love scenes, then I don't think this book is for you.	2005-07-11
US	50810207	RSS1YA84RJWV2	0505524929	743196609	Virtual Warrior	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Hero Finds Love in an Alternate Reality Video Game	The third in a trilogy, VIRTUAL WARRIOR is a fresh look at what happens when a modern-day hero magically enters a virtual reality video game.  In this story, Neil decides to start life anew by willingly entering the alternate world found in the game, only to find himself flung into the court intrigues and power struggle between Ardra of the Ice Fortress (who was featured in the second book, VIRTUAL DESIRE) and Someht, the High Councilor who wants her lands.  Rather than concentrate on the slavery issues, like the author did in the first two books of the trilogy, this story delves deeper into social customs and rivalries, as well as gives the reader a closer look at the main bad guy in the trilogy, Someht.  It also doesn't rely on back story, which is nice.  Ardra makes for an interesting heroine in that she comes across as both subservient in some ways, yet strong in many others.  Neil recreates himself as the pilgrim \\"Lien,\\" and grows as a character (he starts off the story wanting to help no one but himself, but ends up becoming the ultimate defender of justice).  He also acquires magical abilities, which are pretty interesting (though I would have liked to know how and why he ended up so gifted - that was unclear in the story).  There wasn't anything \\"bad\\" with the story, by the way, other than at times I felt the political drama overshadowed the romance a little bit.  Still, it was entertaining and different.  Definitely a big-time fantasy of a romance.    FYI: The trilogy begins with VIRTUAL HEAVEN (the best of the three), followed by VIRTUAL DESIRE (a blah sequel), and ending with VIRTUAL WARRIOR (different from the first two books entirely - like I said, refreshing).	2005-07-04

Oh well.  I read the paranormal romance A LOST TOUCH OF BLISS by Amy Tolnitch in a little over 4 hours.  It wasn't a long book, and it kept my interest.  The gist of the story is, in England 1196, Cain sends for his ex-lover Amice to help drive away a ghost from his castle, and the two find themselves unable to resist each other all over again.  It was an interesting storyline, which is what prompted me to buy the book (based off of other Amazon reviews).  However, now having read it ...     I swear, I DID look for something good in the book to rave about, something to offset some of the things I didn't like, and the closest I could come to it was the fact that Cain (the hero) is bested in a swordfight by another man who wishes to marry Amice.  I thought, wow, isn't that original to have the hero lose?  But then, the more I thought about it, the more it didn't seem \\"right\\" (it just made the hero look bad).      So, what was it I REALLY didn't like?  Here's just a couple examples ... the bad guy was a one-dimensional carbon cutout whose only purpose was to provide the requisite \\"hero rescues the heroine\\" scene in the book ... Cain's family secret was silly ... a lot of the issues between Amice and Cain could have been resolved by chapter 2 if they had just spoken to each other about their past misunderstandings, etc., etc.      That said, A LOST TOUCH OF BLISS wasn't a terrible book.  Like I mentioned upfront, I read it quickly and it kept me entertained.  It was just that (ghosts aside), the story wasn't credible, in my opinion.  To give you an idea of paranormal romances I do like, look up THE BRIDE FINDER by Susan Carroll or A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR by Jude Devereaux.  Anyway, A LOST TOUCH OF BLISS is alright reading.  After all, I'm the only one who gave it a mediocre review.  Maybe you'll like it better than I did.	2005-06-22
US	50810207	R2NAP3A7EZ6J3O	0505522551	147035301	The Last Viking (Viking (Love Spell))	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Norse Viking Is Shipwrecked into the Future & Finds Love	THE LAST VIKING by Sandra Hill is a time-traveling romance in which Rolf the Norse Viking is magically shipwrecked in 1990's Maine, where he meets \\"Merry-Death,\\" an expert in medieval history and the woman he falls in love with.  The story is cute and witty, and most of it revolves around Rolf becoming adjusted to modern-day life while trying to figure out how to return home to the past.  Rolf also has many endearing traits.  While he is a domineering man, he's also very tender and he has a lot of personality quirks, like an obsession for oreo cookies and a love for the TV show \\"Home Improvement.\\"  He also brought home a scarred dog from the pound -how can you not love him after that?  As a romance novel hero, Rolf ranks high as an all-time personal favorite.    The reason I didn't give this book a 5-star rating, however, is twofold.  First, I was super excited by the prospect that Rolf, a real-life Viking, would end up in a confrontation with Merideth's snobby parents, both who are professors and experts in medieval history. But the author killed that confrontation by having Meredith call her parents and tell them not to come over.  Why?  I was so disappointed!!!  Second, I found Meredith to be a little irritating as a heroine.  For example, she screamed and shrieked nonstop throughout the book, worse than a little kid.  Stuff like that made her less attractive in my eyes.    Still, the book is a lot of fun.  I enjoyed the humor and Rolf's antics, as well as the interesting Viking cultural and historical tidbits.  I highly recommend it!    Please note THE LAST VIKING is part of a time-traveling trilogy that also includes #2) TRULY, MADLY VIKING and #3) THE VERY VIRILE VIKING.  An alternate read would be Johanna Lindsey's Viking time-travel, which is called UNTIL FOREVER (the hero is Thor's cursed brother).	2005-06-20

Since most time-travels usually send the hero or heroine back in time to Old England or the Scottish Highlands, RUN NO MORE is a breath of fresh air, setting-wise, as it takes place in exotic locales like Tahiti and Rio de Janeiro.  It's also the first romance I've ever read that revolved around cat burglars on a jewel heist to steal a magic stone.  And, it's the first I've encountered that uses Brazilian voodoo as a key plot point.    The characters are all interesting, from crippled hero Ian (a former cat burglar) to young Tasya, his tormented protg and heroine, to secondary characters ranging from Ian's Brazilian and English pals to his former ex-partner, a double-crossing gambler named Alex.  The storyline is fast-paced, and I even became anxious at the very end, wondering if Tasya and Ian were really going to end up together.      My only complaint about the book revolved around Tasya's abusive past at the hands of Richard, who was over-the-top as the bad guy in the story.  I had no problem believing in magic jewels and time travel, but Richard's almost cartoon-ish evilness was too much for me to swallow.    Anyway, I highly recommend RUN NO MORE as a different and enjoyable reading experience.  If you are like me, you'll want to book a flight to Brazil as soon as you finish this book!	2005-06-14

I didn't like EDGE OF THE MOON as much as I liked its prequel, KILLING MOON.  The second novel in a suspenseful/romantic werewolf series, EDGE OF THE MOON is about cop Jack Thornton and graphic designer Kathryn, who become pawns in a deadly battle between a magician and the demon he intends to enslave.  The magician wants to sacrifice Kathryn as part of a ceremony to take control of the demon, while the demon uses Jack and Kathryn to protect it from the magician.  It's actually a creative and fascinating idea for a paranormal romance ... unfortunately, the story didn't appeal to me.    For one, I felt the story dragged at the beginning and spent too long setting up the plot (and, while Jack was a fascinating and sympathetic character in Book #1, the issues revolving around his kids became boring in this second novel).  In addition, I questioned the sexual tension between Kathryn and Jack, as I didn't feel it was clarified that it WASN'T the demon who made them hot and bothered for each other.  Ross the werewolf also appears in this book, but his character isn't used very well as a secondary character (I was also surprised Ross admitted to Kathryn that he was a werewolf without knowing her, when it took him forever to tell the truth to his lover in Book #1).     Anyway, while I didn't like this book that much, it may appeal to others, especially if they hadn't read the first book.  However, the next book in the series, WITCHING MOON, has a werewolf hero (which I prefer) so I'll definitely be reading it.	2005-06-10

The dragon is actually a man with a secret, and the virgin, Gwendolyn, isn't allowed to see his face while she remains his pampered prisoner.  Nevertheless, she falls in love with him, and it is her love that helps break his family's blood curse.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed this story, which is full of witty humor and funny situations, such as Gwendolyn's botched attempt at escape (she gets stuck climbing out a window, leaving the Dragon with a lovely view of her derriere).  Sometimes, I thought the fact that Gwennie was overweight was brought up too often, but it didn't detract from her being a sympathetic heroine. <br /> <br />Though THE BRIDE AND THE BEAST is a quick, fun read, I didn't enjoy it as much as other books I've read by Medeiros.  I'm not sure why (perhaps the ending dragged on too long).  I prefer her witch time-travel BREATH OF MAGIC and its sequel TOUCH OF ENCHANTMENT a lot more.  Still, I recommend THE BRIDE AND THE BEAST any day as a good fairytale romance to curl up with and enjoy. <br />	2005-06-08

I'd read a couple other books by Moning before and was unimpressed, so I am really stunned that I liked this book so much.  Yes, it's not a perfect book, but it had a good story with compelling characters.  The gist of the story is that modern-day beauty Adrienne is sent back in time by a vengeful faerie with the hopes of making prettyboy Hawk, a 16th century Highlander, suffer the humiliation of marrying a woman who hates men.  Both Adrienne and Hawk have pasts, and because of that, Adrienne struggles to the very end not to succumb to her handsome husband.   <br /> <br />In my mind, the most fascinating character in BEYOND is neither Adrienne or Hawk, but Adam Black, the dark faerie who makes an appearance in most of Moning's Highlander books.  He is hot, hot, hot here.  Even Adrienne drools over Adam first, before she even sees her husband, Hawk.  Of course, this creates a lot of jealousy and is a driving force behind the plotline. <br /> <br />Anyway, there's lots of good stuff in BEYOND, including a sexy description of taming falcons and a heroine who keeps flashing back and forth through time at the whim of fairies (the bad stuff includes, among others, the fact that Adrienne is so-called \\"perfect,\\" yet she comes across as a serious shrew).  Still, I'm actually looking forward to the next book, which is about Hawk's friend, Grimm. <br /> <br />The Highlander series, by the way, goes in this order: BEYOND THE HIGHLAND MIST, TO TAME A HIGHLAND WARRIOR, THE HIGHLANDER'S TOUCH, KISS OF THE HIGHLANDER, THE DARK HIGHLANDER, and IMMORTAL HIGHLANDER. <br />	2005-06-07

I liked the moody atmosphere in this novel, which well uses a stormy, isolated beach on a small island as its setting.  Nicholas is a blunt hero who knows what he wants, while the heroine, Makenna, is refreshingly forward herself.  The ghost is as much a character in this novel as the hero and heroine, though it is a malevolent presence intent upon doing harm.      I read THE GHOST OF CARNAL COVE in one afternoon.  The writing is clean and straightforward, and the story flows well.  There wasn't as much action as I'd like - or conflict between the hero and heroine - since the story more revolved around Makenna's past and the ghost.  It's an entertaining book, though I can't say I loved it.  There weren't any scenes that stuck out as memorable (however, I thought the dog was a nice addition).  Still, GHOST was a good read.  Pleasant.  Like eating apple pie, not too sweet, but not too fancy, either.    FYI: Here's a couple other ghostly romances to read ... BEAUDRY'S GHOST by Carolan Ivey (Civil War), GENTLE FROM THE NIGHT by Meagan McKinney (spooky Gothic), STARDUST OF YESTERDAY by Lynn Kurland (a ghostly knight), and A PHANTOM AFFAIR by JoAnn Ferguson (sweet ghost romance).	2005-06-05

I just finished reading it, and thought it was not only inspiring (on an emotional level), but fascinating as well.  I think everyone in my family became sick from me quoting this book every five seconds.  I couldn't help it; there were some interesting tidbits about accumulating financial independence that I hadn't thought about.  I'd always known a car or clothes don't equal a person's financial status, but this book help cement the reality of it.  What I thought even more interesting were the chapters on adult children who are always getting cash gifts from parents (there is nothing to be jealous about!).   <br /> <br />Regarding those same children, I loved this quote in the book: \\"Consider for a moment that you are a typical affluent parent.  You noted that your oldest son or daughter even at an early age was extremely independent, achievement-oriented, and well-disciplined.  Your instinct is to nurture these traits by not trying to control his or her decisions.  Instead, you spend more time helping your less resourceful child make decisions, or you actually make decisions for him.  With what result?  You strengthen the strong child and weaken the weak.\\"  That is so true of my family!  And it goes beyond financial support to emotional and mental as well!   <br /> <br />Anyway, I felt this book was eye-opening - as well as a good choice on my financial advisor's part in perking me up and letting me see that I'm on the \\"right\\" track.  It also gave me some options I hadn't thought of before.  I think I'm going to buy my siblings their own copies ofthis book for Christmas.   <br />	2005-06-04

A futuristic romance, it is the story of Sahylah Graymist, heroic Captain of a starfighter for the Coalition, and Wolf, the last of a people opposed to the Coalition, who is given to Shaylah as a pleasure slave.  Seeing the proud, regal Wolf in chains is too much for Shaylah, who sets out to free him, even if it means becoming a traitor and risking her own life.  This story is gripping, to say the least, and full of steamy love scenes.  It's also amazing to read a romance where the heroine is in charge, and is the one doing all the saving.  At the same time, the not-so-perfect heroine does something so profoundly stupid that you just want to choke her - and you can't help but read more, wondering how Wolf will respond, and if he'll ever forgive her.  I loved this book and can't help but wonder why it is out of print (though it's worth the effort of buying used).  Happily, I understand it has a sequel called SKYPIRATE, which plenty of reviewers have raved about.  I can't wait to read it.     FYI: For more intergalactic sci-fi romances, look for SHIELDER by Catherine Spangler, WARRIOR'S WOMAN by Johanna Lindsey, and KNIGHT OF A TRILLION STARS by Dara Joy.  All are the beginning of series.	2005-05-27

One is a vampire story, and the other three feature shape-shifters.  Overall, they weren't anything to rave about.  Here's my assessment:<br /><br />\\"Winter Born\\" by Sherrilyn Kenyon revolves around were-panthers who meet and fall in love at a convention in Atlanta.  I bought STROKE OF MIDNIGHT for this story, as I am a fan of Kenyon's Dark-Hunters series, but this story ended up being disappointing.  Acheron and Simi make an appearance, but they don't add anything to the story (in fact, Acheron comes across as whiny).  Worse, the love story between Pandora and Dante is rushed and doesn't ring true, and the threats they face lack in tension.  Basically, Pandora is in heat, and Dante takes her to bed and makes her his mate.  That's the gist of the story.  Ho-hum.  Rating: Two stars.<br /><br />\\"Born of the Night\\" by Amanda Ashley is pretty cheeseball.  Shanara is taken as a hostage by Lord Reyes to avenge the fact that Shanara's father killed Reyes' father.  Reyes is also a werewolf.  It sounds like an interesting story.  It isn't.  Most of the story suffers from the fact that the characters keep changing their minds every five seconds (to ravish or not ravish, imprison or not imprison, escape or not escape, etc.).  The worst moment in the story occurs after Shanara learns Reyes intends to marry her out of vengeance (as a means to provoke her father), and Shanara spends half a day deciding whether to have a pink or blue wedding dress.  How dumb are you to spend half a day (!!) picking a color for a wedding that's forced?  Rating: One star.<br /><br />\\"Make it Last Forever\\" by L.A. Banks had an interesting storyline: Tara was bitten and is turning into a vampire, and a golden-haired biker turns out to be her unexpected hero.  I also liked the erotic shampoo scene.  However, the epilogue of this story makes it clear that this is part of a series that I haven't read.  I also didn't like how it ended.  I prefer happily ever after endings, and this one wasn't like that.  Rating: Two stars.<br /><br />\\"Red Moon Rising\\" by Lori Handeland is a first-person narration of a writer with writer's block who is being chased by a \\"skinwalker\\" (Native American werewolf).  Lucky for her, a hunky werewolf hunter has come to her rescue.  The story was fast paced and entertaining, though the love affair was rushed.  Also, Maya's flippancy can either be fun or annoying, depending whether you like people with attitude.  (Note: I suspect this story is part of a series about monster hunters, which I might like to read).  Rating: Three stars.	2005-05-26

I even read aloud some parts to various family members, including the tidbit that eating actually dehydrates you (I had no idea).  This was a short, easy-to-read, handy little book that you should definitely take with you on a trip to the great outdoors.  It's a great gift for that guy/gal who loves camping or hiking, or for anyone you know who drives through long stretches of desert.  For better mileage, I'd stick this book in your bathroom as the \\"bathroom book,\\" especially if you have a big household or get a lot of guests.  You never know who might need info like this one day to survive.  Plus, it's interesting!	2005-05-26

THE BLACK JEWELS TRILOGY by Anne Bishop is imaginative and utterly fascinating.  The book is over 1,000 pages, which I read in 3 days.  Actually, I couldn't tear myself away from the book, it was that engrossing.  A fantasy based on Hell, THE BLACK JEWELS TRILOGY is set in a world similar to ours, except it is a warring matriarchal society ruled by witches, many of whom control men and other witches through sexual deviancy.  There are three heroes in this book: Saetan (the dead father and mentor), Lucivar (the angry winged fighter and brother), and Daemon (the sadistic pleasure slave and lover).  The heroine is Jaenelle Angelline, the abused young girl who grows up to be Witch, beloved and most powerful queen of all witches.  The unconditional love that binds them together is touching, and makes you want to read more and more about these fascinating characters as they grow together and face war.  Seriously, I don't think 1,000 pages is enough (!!!); I could have happily read more.  The story, however, isn't for everyone: there is a lot of sexual torture in this book (not too graphic), as well as severe violence.  I cried a couple times reading this, especially when it came to attacks on the Kindred.  If you can handle the fact that a lot of characters die, you'll be okay.  One other (good) thing I'd like to point out is while this book isn't a romance per say, it is rather romantic, with a delicious and frustrating love story as the major thread holding the trilogy together. PS. I just found out it does have a sequel (big fat yeah!!!) called DREAMS MADE FLESH.	2005-05-20

A Highlander Romance, Ghost Story & Time Travel in One	I wasn't really impressed with A MAN IN A KILT by Sandy Blair.  It's the story of modern-day New Yorker Beth who inherits a castle in Scotland, which happens to be haunted by a handsome, yet cursed Highlander ghost, and ends up whisked into the past to help break the Highlander's curse.  It was a short romance novel, so maybe that's why a lot of the story felt rushed, especially Beth's initial response to her ghost and in how quickly the two fell in love.  I also had clarity issues with the story.  I'm a professional writer and editor, and I had trouble following the story line.  There was a huge amount of Scottish dialect used in this book, more than I've encountered in any romance novel, but I don't think that was the problem.  I think the problem was that key issues should have been stressed more (like why Duncan was cursed, why he and the Bruce were enemies, etc.) over annoying complaints like Beth's jealousy and her constant low-self esteem issues.  Also, the ending is anti-climactic.  I kept waiting to \\"see\\" the curse lifted or to see what would happen when Albany realized Duncan had married the wrong girl.  I was also curious to know how Beth felt about a priest watching she and Duncan make love the first time, but that was never addressed again.  Oh well.  A MAN IN A KILT has a sequel called A ROGUE IN A KILT, but I don't think I'll read it.	2005-05-12

A paranormal historical romance, it is the story of an escaped convict and a female attorney who end up in a deserted island in the South Pacific with three orphaned children, a goat, and a magic genie.  I loved watching these strangers come together and become a family.  I also loved watching how Hank the convict softened, how Margaret (\\"Smitty\\") the attorney learned to relax, and how the two fell in love slowly and poignantly in a tropical paradise.  I also loved the author's wry sense of humor, which made every confrontation (especially between Hank and Smitty, Hank and the goat, and Hank and the genie) turn into a giggle fest.  The author knew exactly how to make fun of her own characters without being mean; it was actually quite touching.  This was a lovely book, guaranteed not to disappoint.  You definitely want to expand your imagination reading IMAGINE, which had some great lessons about life and love.      If you liked this book, you might also like Jill Barnett's witty witch romance, BEWITCHING, and it's hysterical sequel, DREAMING.  Teresa Medieros also writes with similar humor and themes (look for her witch time-travels BREATH OF MAGIC and its sequel, TOUCH OF ENCHANTMENT).	2005-05-10

Though it seems written for a young audience, STARDUST by Neil Gaiman has some mature themes and content.  Set in the land of Faerie, STARDUST is the story of Tristran, who sets out to bring back a falling star to his beloved, and ends up on a life-altering adventure.  The star - a blonde girl who doesn't eat or drink - is sullen and angry, and not at all thrilled to be captured by Tristran.  Unbeknownst to them, the star is also being chased after by other enemies, including a witch who wants the star's heart.<br /><br />STARDUST is beautifully written, and the world of Faerie is creative and fascinating.  Almost every line in the book is filled with meaning, and each character has an interesting story to tell.  I loved the book for its descriptions and interesting take on fairy tales.  What I didn't like so much were the many animal deaths (some brutally violent) and the surprising amount of sex in the book.  There are definitely some \\"mature\\" scenes to skip over if you plan to read this to a child.<br /><br />Anyway, STARDUST is a creative story filled with imaginative going-ons.  Highly recommended for adults in search of a good, short fairy tale.	2005-05-06

Bangs has a smarmy, witty writing style that makes you laugh, often at Blythe's mental comebacks.  Blythe is the heroine of this vampire romance, a girl from Earth in 2339 who time-travels back to Scotland of 1785 for business purposes.  It's her job to make clients happy, and the client chosen for her is a 500-year old vampire named Darach, who just happens to ooze sexual danger.  If that's not intriguing enough to read about, read MASTER OF ECSTASY for its other interesting couple: cosmic troublemakers Ganymede and his lusty cat, Sparkle Stardust - both evil and enjoying it.  I want to read more about those two!!!  Anyway, I had a fantastic time reading MASTER OF ECSTASY.  I finished it in one afternoon, and giggled throughout the entire book.  Darach is a hottie vampire and Blythe a strong, enjoyable heroine.  The sexual chemistry is great, and very creative.  Highly recommended. PS. It has a sequel called NIGHT BITES.	2005-05-04

It's the story of Greek god Darius, ruler of gems, who in trying to break a 3,000 year old curse, inhabits a statue that is about to be sold at a charity auction and comes to life - to the chagrin of the statue's sculptor, Alexandra.  What happens after that is silly fun, with Darius wanting to go back to his playboy ways, especially to woo Alexandra, while Alexandra tries to trick Darius into becoming a statue again for the sake of helping orphans.  Throw in Darius' interesting family of Greek Gods, including a computer-obsessed Zeus, and it's all fun and witty humor.  You never know what Darius is going to do or say next, in his charming, egotistical way.  Fun reading, with a moral about family at the end.      For similar reads, try Gena Showalter's THE STONE PRINCE, about a handsome alien-turned-statue and the girl who must break his curse.  Or, if you are interested in Greek God heroes, read Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series, beginning with FANTASY LOVER.	2005-04-28

Spanning 200 years, it follows the lives of the mysterious Montgomery heiresses, rumored to be vampires, contrasted with the modern-day love affair between a cop named Sean and the latest Montgomery heiress, Maggie.  Sean is also the lead cop on a series of gruesome murders committed by a serial killer imitating Jack the Ripper - and who somehow is connected to Maggie. <br /> <br />I didn't particularly care for the story ... and my list of complaints is long.  The book is actually a quick read and keeps your attention, but I felt it was too melodramatic (and cheesy), especially the prologue.  I also didn't like the author's writing style; she wasted a lot of time on unnecessary \\"fluff\\" details and dialogue, none of which pertained to the plot or romance.  The plot line itself was interesting, but I was rolling my eyes way too often to enjoy it and had figured out the major secrets long before they were finally revealed.  The happily-ever-after ending was also wrapped up too nicely, with no explanation as to how \\"the miracle\\" happened.  All in all, it was an unsatisfying reading experience. <br /> <br />FYI: Erotica writer Angela Knight's THE FOREVER KISS or JANE'S WARLORD both handle these themes much better, the former being about vampires, the latter having a time-traveling Jack the Ripper. <br />	2005-04-24

Um ... was there a plot in between all that sex?  TEMPTING THE BEAST by Lora Leigh is basically a porno about a journalist named Marinus who becomes the mate of a genetically engineered man named Callan who is half-human, half-lion.  Callan is leader of his pride, a group of mixed-breed humans on the run from the evil council who created them.  It's a fascinating concept that is marred by an overdose of sex.  I love romances, but I never thought I'd complain about too much physical loving.  This one overdid it.  Basically, Callan and Marinus are in heat the entire book, from page one onward.  I think there's a graphic love scene, like, every other page.  Raunchy ones, too.  Believe me, this book is not for the faint of heart.  Anyway, I like the idea behind the series ... I just don't know if I want to dare reading book #2 (this is book #1 in the series).  Sometimes too much detail is a scary thing....	2005-04-20

Liu was a quick read (I finished it in about 5 hours) and entertaining, though it wasn't as fulfilling as I'd like, story-wise.  Unfortunately, I finished it feeling I had a lot more questions than were answered by the book.      The basic premise of the story was fascinating: Dela buys a riddle-box from a Chinese woman in a market in Beijing, and out of the box poofs a 2,000 year old warrior-slave named Hari who can shape-shift into a tiger.  Unfortunately, both Dela and Hari have serious enemies, who attempt to kill them throughout the entire book.  Dela also wants to break Hari's curse, so that he may live life as a free man.      The best thing about this book, in my opinion, is the addition of Dela's psychic, gun-toting friends, who add much-needed levity to the action.  The worst thing is that the moment we meet Dela's pals (especially enigmatic Artur, the ex-Russian mobster), I lost interest in Dela and Hari and became more interested in those guys instead.      There were other problems I had with the story, ranging from its painfully overdone \\"poetic\\" writing style to the numerous issues it skips over.  Like why was Max mentioned repeatedly, yet never given a real scene in the book, even at the end when it mentioned he would be home in a few days?  Where did Hari's people live 2,000 years ago and why are they dying out?  Why did the Magi absolutely have to have Hari's sister (I mean, if all he needed was a tiger female, couldn't he have found another one he could mate with? Why all the animosity toward Hari)?  The list goes on and on.  Also, the subplot featuring the Asian mafia seemed completely unnecessary, but that's just me.     Anyway, for what it's worth, I think the storyline is fascinating reading, though I found it frustrating in the extreme to have so many questions.  Who knows, maybe they'll be answered in the next book, called SHADOW TOUCH (which I'm pleased to hear is about about Artur).      ***For a similar story, trySherrilyn Kenyon's FANTASY LOVER (son of a Greek Goddess is cursed to serve women in bed) or Gena Showalter's THE PLEASURE SLAVE (alien warrior is cursed into being a slave until he finds true love).***	2005-04-18

To summarize, it's a story about the relationship between TV producer and single dad Logan and his accident-prone, yet sexy neighbor Melody, who becomes the star of his TV show, \\"The Kitchen Witch.\\"  Only, Melody can't cook ... but she does have pointy witch hats.  I purchased the book because I thought it might have magical moments, but the witch stuff is used more as a gimmick for the TV show than anything else.  I also thought the story dragged a bit (it took me a week to read it, when I usually devour a book this size in 4 or 5 hours).  Why?  Well, for one, the cheeky writing style and glaring typos were a distraction. Two, I got tired of Logan and Melody holding out from hooking up when there was no reason for them not to hook up.  The excuse was he needed stability and she was the anti-thesis of stability, yet everything they did together was perfect and peachy-keen, until somebody else interrupted.  I don't know - I just didn't see the conflict in that.  Even when Logan began \\"dating\\" another woman, you knew there was no need to worry, because the other woman was so awful, there was no suspense in wondering if Melody really had competition for Logan's affections.  Anyway, as I said, it's an alright story.  Predictable and cute, with a cherry on top.  But probably not something I'd read again.	2005-04-17

Set in medieval times, the heroine Lianna is scarred by pox and her hero knight, Jason, is feared as a sorcerer.  It's a non-sexual story, but that's not what bugged me.  What bothered me were pertinent questions that were not answered, like why was Lianna's family killed and why would no one tell the King that his ward was poisoned?  Rating: 3 stars. <br /> <br />\\"An Interrupted Tapestry\\" by Madeline Hunter had good passion and a believable background between the main characters.  Set in London 200 or 300 years ago, wealthy merchant Andreas is helping Giselle raise money to pay her kidnapped brother's ransom.  It's almost painful to watch them deny their feelings for each other.  Rating: 5 stars. <br /> <br />\\"Dragonswan\\" by Sherrilyn Kenyon was the reason I bought this anthology; it was also a letdown.  Don't get me wrong: I love Sebastian, from his frankness to his dark sexuality to his cool facial tattoo.  I also loved the fact that he was a dragon who could travel through time.  Everything else about the story was blah.  Kenyon's Dark-Hunter fans will want to read it though, for its explanation about the were-hunter's \\"claiming\\" ritual.  Rating: 3 stars. <br /> <br />\\"Into the Dreaming\\" by Karen Marie Moning was a delight.  I'm not a fan of hers, so I'm still reeling in shock over the fact I liked this story the most.  Highlander Aedan has one chance to free himself from eternal servitude to a dark (and deliciously intriguing) faery king, and Jane is sent back in time to help him.  The characters are great, the attitude fun.  Rating: 5 stars. <br />	2005-04-11

I enjoyed this book.  The writing was clean, and the major characters stood out as individuals.  Anatole is the dark, brooding hero with a tragic past and the ability to levitate objects and see in future.  Madeline is a practical bride, a woman who doesn't believe in magic or things that go bump in the night.  They offset each other well.  Secondary characters like the bride finder and Anatole's family members also stand out, especially Anatole's rival, Roman.  What I liked most about this novel was the unexpected twists (mostly humorous) that occurred here and there, especially when it came to Anatole and Madeline embarrassing themselves and each other during their first few encounters as husband and wife.  I laughed out loud a couple of times.  I recommend THE BRIDE FINDER to anyone interested in a sweet, magical love story with an aching hero and the girl who can save him.  Please note this is the first book in a series about the magic-wielding family.	2005-04-06

The gist of the story is that private investigator Ross Marshall has special werewolf talents that help him track down missing people and killers, but now he's run into a killer who's intent on hunting him; in the meantime, Ross can't allow himself to fall in love with Megan, because his werewolf powers are just as tragic as they are superhuman.  I liked both Ross and Megan - each had interesting backgrounds and strong roles in the story.  The secondary characters, including a cop and the serial killer, were also flushed out and realistic.  The plot was fast-paced, suspenseful, and easy to follow, and it only took me an afternoon to finish it.  It wasn't a perfect book - each major character had the same abusive parent issue, and a subplot revolving around bad things happening at Megan's work was an obvious device used only to show off Ross' werewolf side. Still, it was a good read, and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series (this was book #1).  Book #2 is EDGE OF THE MOON.	2005-04-02

I loved the first book, but this second one ... well, it sort of lacked.  It was entertaining, mind you.  I read it pretty quick.  I liked the heroine, Gwen.  I sort of liked the hero Vad, though he wasn't as defined a character as Gwen.  I enjoyed Vad much more when he was thrust in the modern world and all confused, versus when he was a warrior on a quest in his own world.  The quest dominated this book, as well as a secondary character named Ardra, which took away from dealing with Gwen and Vad's own back story and love affair.  For instance, Gwen had an intriguing background being widowed and estranged from her family, but the author never delved into it, not even to answer basic questions like how did Gwen's first husband die?  All in all, VIRTUAL DESIRE was an alright read, though I doubt I'll build up any desire of my own to read it again.    The series, by the way, begins with VIRTUAL HEAVEN (an excellent read), followed by VIRTUAL DESIRE, and VIRTUAL WARRIOR.    Note to the Publisher: Regarding that saying, don't judge a book ... VIRTUAL DESIRE's cover is one of the most horrible covers I have ever encountered.  Not only is the model icky, but the cover itself is blurry.  Is it a photo?  A painting?  Who knows?  I would never have purchased this book if I had seen it at a bookstore, just because the cover is so cheap and unattractive.	2005-04-01

One of the best time travel romances I've read, THE AUTUMN LORD plays off of the King Arthur legend by having a Merlin-like old wizard from medieval France zap modern-day heroine Diane into the past and into the life of Simon, a handsome lord made bitter by his wife's betrayal and son's mad desire to kill him. <br /> <br />There are four things I adored about this book.  One, Diane has a very \\"real\\" reaction to being transported back in time.  She's terrified and refreshingly un-heroine like in that she's not trying to change the past or save anyone as much as she's simply trying to survive.  Two, Diane is cursed with the inability to talk unless she's singing a song or telling a story, which makes for a very thoughtful (and vulnerable) character.  Three, Diane is part Chinese, so almost every character in the book vilifies her right away, convinced she's a demon or evil, and abuses her as such.  This is a sad, but unique, approach to the time travel romance, highlighting the danger over the curiosity/exploration of the past.  Finally, this book has an ending that is not only satisfying, but also rewrites the Arthurian legend as well.   <br /> <br />If you are looking for a fresh and unique take to the time travel romance, read THE AUTUMN LORD.  Highly recommended! <br />	2005-03-28

From page one, this book jumps right into the sex.  Lots of it.  There's sex between the hero and heroine - both regular and vampire-style.  There's also a heck of a lot of sexual deviancy and rape in this book, all surrounding the evil characters.  In fact, rape is all they seem to think about.  Luckily, the rape scenes are not graphic.  But they're there, so this book is most definitely not for the squeamish.   <br /> <br />This being the second Angela Knight book I've read, I've noticed it's a theme of hers to have a modern-day reporter heroine put in mortal danger by a sexually perverted killer, with the damaged (and otherwordly) warrior-hero being the only one who can save her.  Read JANE'S WARLORD and compare it to this book, and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br />Anyway, I'm kind of uncertain about how I feel about THE FOREVER KISS.  I read it in 4 hours straight, so it kept my attention.  But all the sexual violence grossed me out a little bit.  It wasn't exactly a feel-good type of romance.  Would I re-read it?  Honestly, I'm not sure. <br />	2005-03-25

I thought two of the stories were enjoyable reads.    \\"Darkfest\\" by Amanda Ashley is a fairy tale about a wizard who falls in love with a blind village girl.  If it had been fleshed out into a novel, it might have been better.  As is, it glosses over a lot of issues that Ashley brings up and never follows through.  Like why is Lord Darkfest drawn to the dark side?  What did the tapestry depicting the wolf's death really mean? Etc.  Also, there were little inconsistencies that bugged me.  For instance, the story claims to take place before recorded time, yet the houses have crosses and the villagers fear the devil and hell.  Two stars, at best.    \\"Phantom Lover\\" by Sherrilyn Kenyon plays off her Dark-Hunter series, featuring a Greek god named V'Aiden who appears to Erin in her dreams.  This story has good interaction with the two main characters and features a delightful twist.  Fun! Fun! Fun!  Four stars.    \\"Under Her Spell\\" by Maggie Shayne was well written and engaging.  It is the story of a Witch who acts as consultant to a Witchcraft-themed TV show and who is strangely drawn to the show's producer, a man delving into the dark side.  The care Shayne puts into describing Wiccan ceremony and lifestyle really defines this story.  Five stars. (***I noticed a lot of reviewers disliked this story immensely.  I almost skipped it myself, because of that.  I'm glad I decided to read it, especially because it was the first witch story I've read that dealt with Wicca (and the stereotypes of witches).  This is just a guess, but I wonder if people disliked the story because of the religious aspect to it.  It's not your average girl-runs-around-casting-cute-spells witch story***).      \\"A Wulf's Curse\\" by Ronda Thompson is about a girl who falls for the beast tamer in a traveling circus, not knowing he is really a werewolf.  This story had the cheesiest dialogue ever, and the plotline was ridiculously similar to the plot of TO CATCH A WOLF by Susan Krinard, which was a 1000 times better. One star.	2005-03-24

Despite its odd title, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A NAKED ELF is a fun fairy-tale of a romance set in a magical world of elves and fairies that can only reached through a living, thinking portal.  And into the portal steps Jane, a modern day gal with a snarky attitude.  Well, actually, Jane is kidnapped and dragged through the portal - but only after she runs over a shape-shifting elf disguised as a bunny.  Hence begins Jane's adventure as she goes to court (in a castle, no less) to face murder charges.   <br /> <br />Jane's lawyer, Charlie, is a gorgeous half-breed with luminous fairy wings.  He is a reluctant lawyer and a reluctant hero.  That is, when Jane isn't driving him batty, she's driving him wild.  Especially when she touches his wings (I never thought of fairy wings as being erogenous!).  They make for a cute couple. <br /> <br />I thought this was a fun, tongue-in-cheek story that has as much romance as it does questing adventure.  Jane can sometimes over do it on the sly, snide comments (especially in the first chapter), but she is also a strong, confident heroine who follows her heart, no matter what others say.  She also plots the Seduction of Charlie, Phases 1-3, which was different.  Not many romances feature the girl doing all the chasing. <br /> <br />The resolution of this story didn't make as much sense as I wanted (of course, I finished it at 1 am, so that could have been due to exhaustion), but I think the point of this story was to enjoy the journey.  It was rather creative, I have to add. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for those who enjoy fairy tales as much as romance, as well as for pop culture references.  If your idea of a true \\"fantasy hero\\" is an elf or fairy, read this! <br />	2005-03-18

I stayed up until 2 am last night to finish this book.  Now I know why it received awards!  SHIELDER is the first in a sci-fi romance series set in a hostile galaxy where Controllers will do whatever they can to annihilate Shielders.  Nessa is an outcast, a crippled Shielder with epilepsy who tries to save her Colony by offering her body as a host for a killer virus in hopes of finding a cure in time.  It's a top secret mission complicated tenfold when her spacecraft breaks down and she's rescued by a surly, revenge-oriented bounty hunter named Chase.  Unfortunately, Chase works for the Controllers, so Nessa can't trust him even if he's the only person EVER who treats her as a human being and touches her as a woman.    This book immediately sucks you into his world and into Nessa's hopes and fears.  From then on, it's fast paced and gripping.  I could not put it down.  Nessa and Chase have a fascinating relationship.  At first, she thinks herself totally unworthy of anything, while he is a total control freak.  How they grow around each other is amazing.  Plus, the threat to Nessa goes way beyond simple bad guys.  She is grievously sick; worse, her death could doom an entire race of people.    I highly recommend SHIELDER and look forward to reading the next book in its series (which is called SHADOWER)!	2005-03-17

In JEWELS, shy American Jude Murray runs away from her unhappy life as a professor and divorcee to relocate to Ireland, where she meets Aidan Gallagher, the handsome owner of a local pub.  Aidan draws her out with his charm and warmth, but is it enough to ease her self-doubt and allow her to fall in love?      I loved this story.  From the very first sentence, I knew it was going to be fantastic.  It draws you in, and you feel like you know all the characters, not just Jude and Aidan.  You also can \\"see\\" Ireland in all its green glory, and its magic engulfs you, making you believe in fairies and ghosts.    Even more, I liked this story because it was about exploration and self-discovery.  Jude gave up everything to come to Ireland and find herself, both as a woman and a writer.  It was inspiring.  This book is more than just a romance.    If I had to complain, it would be only to say the story moves slowly, mostly because the author is descriptive.  I admit I did skim some flowery passages ... the relationships and repartee were much more interesting.    I'm looking forward to reading the other two books in the trilogy!  And I DEFINITELY want to go to Ireland now!!!!	2005-03-17

I had begun reading it with high hopes, especially since it had so many raving reviews.  But it just did not appeal to me.  The premise of the story itself was promising enough: a modern-day girl from San Francisco inherits a haunted castle in England, which comes with a gorgeous, chivalrous ghost named Kendrick, who'd been murdered in the year 1260.  Kendrick was a thoroughly enjoyable hero - a tender barbarian with a wicked sense of humor and a humongous, inflated ego.  He was great fun!  The problem I had with the book was with the heroine, Genevieve.  She is probably the lamest heroine I've ever had the misfortune to read about.    (Warning: From this point on, I'm going to get snarky).  In the very first chapter, Gen is told that she inherits the castle, as well as a MASSIVE fortune.  What does this girl - who has spent her entire life fantasizing about knights and dragons - do?  She declines the fantastic offer, saying that she JUST couldn't give up her day job.  Unrealistic?  Oh yeah.  But I was able to deal and move on.  Eventually, she goes to the castle, meets the ghost, and falls in love (rather quickly).  So then she starts lamenting big time over how she and Kendrick can never touch, weeping about it like every 5 seconds.  However, the moment Kendrick becomes a flesh and blood man, she freaks out at the very idea of hugging, kissing, and seeing him (gasp!!) naked.  So, we're supposed to believe Gen suddenly turns frigid because she's a shy, 30-year old virgin who's never even kissed a man.  Uh huh.  Anyway, Gen might have been tolerable if she hadn't spent the entire book dressed in fuzzy pajamas with padded feet AND scarfing down chocolate ice cream and chocolate chip cookie dough every third page.  I couldn't help but wonder at what point she would turn into a hippo.  THAT would have been worth reading about.      Finally, to add insult to injury, this book couldn't even be called a real romance novel because there were no love scenes to read about.  It was tamer than a stuffed teddy bear.  I'm still having a hard time actually believing cool, suave Kendrick could fall for a woman so immature she acted like a 12-year old.  No doubt, Kendrick fell for her because she was the only chick available.  And that's a SAD conclusion....      However, if you are interested in a satisfying and plausible ghostly romance with two awesome characters and a simply evil bad guy, read BEAUDRY'S GHOST by Carolan Ivey.  That's a 5-star masterpiece.	2005-03-12

It takes place right after NIGHT EMBRACE and is the story of ex-slave Zarek - the most hated Dark Hunter in existence (and my favorite) - and how he finds his humanity in the arms of Astrid, a blind nymph sent from Mt. Olympus to judge him.  If Astrid finds nothing redeemable about Zarek, then he will be executed - that is, if an Ancient Evil doesn't get him first.    Zarek's past is so sad there were moments I actually got teary eyed.  And I loved Astrid.  She didn't back down from his surliness or threats, and was one of the most levelheaded heroines of the Dark-Hunter novels I've read.  You can actually see these two fall in love.    The secondary characters were also fun.  Acheron has a huge presence in this book (yeah!), and we are introduced to his demon \\"daughter,\\" Simi, who made me laugh often with her childish desire to barbeque everything in sight, including a certain nasty Greek goddess.  Astrid's wolf, Sasha, was also cool.  I wonder if he'll get a book of his own.    The secondary characters didn't overwhelm the romance (like in NIGHT EMBRACE), but rather added to it.  This was a great story.  Probably the best Dark-Hunter novel, in my opinion (though there are plenty more I still need to read).    DANCE WITH THE DEVIL is book #3 of the Dark-Hunter series.  It would be best to read the others that came before it (the prologue FANTASY LOVER, #1 NIGHT PLEASURES, and #2 NIGHT EMBRACE) since the author does not dwell on backstory. Also, my edition of DANCE WITH THE DEVIL came with a bonus short story called \\"A Dark-Hunter Christmas,\\" which features Simi in it.	2005-03-07

Warning: Do not read INFINITY without reading its prequel ETERNITY, or else you will not understand what happens between Part I (medieval Scotland) and Part 2 (modern day) in INFINITY. <br /> <br />I was looking forward to reading INFINITY, because the hints about Arianna's back-story in ETERNITY intrigued me.  Unfortunately, this sequel didn't grip my attention.  The premise is interesting enough: Arianna and Nicodimus are both Immortal High Witches, who meet and marry - and are killed - before reuniting to battle an evil Dark Witch.  However, the author has a ponderous and brooding writing style that didn't work in this book (it bored me actually), and the story didn't really pick up until after Nic dies.  In the meantime, Arianna irritated me.  She's one of those overly rebellious heroines who brings about disaster everywhere with all her rash decisions - yet all the guys drool all over her anyway cuz she's cute.  (Insert eyeball rolling here)  The ultimate cheesy moment in this book occurs when dirt-poor, social outcast Arianna is told by a Liard that she can pick any guy in the clan to marry - even his own sons - in order to protect her from villagers who want to burn her as a witch.  Right.  Whatever.  Anyway, INFINITY is an alright read, if you don't mind all the caterwauling about unrequited love, etc., that the author pounds you on the head with.  And if you don't mind predictability.  Also, don't expect a lot of magic here.  They are witches, but they never seem to cast any spells.  They just mope about love and sex, and they die (and are resurrected) every so often.  Ho hum.  The prequel was a much better read. <br /> <br />For a silly and delicious witch story, read Teresa Medeiros' BREATH OF MAGIC and its sequel, TOUCH OF ENCHANTMENT. <br /> <br />	2005-03-05
US	50810207	R263JWHC5S9X8B	0312984820	322000736	Night Embrace (Dark-Hunter, Book 3)	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Vampires, Werewolves, Reincarnation & Greek Gods	To date, I've only read three of Sherrilyn Kenyon's paramormal romances, and of the three (FANTASY LOVER, NIGHT PLEASURES, and NIGHT EMBRACE), I enjoyed NIGHT EMBRACE the most.  By far, NIGHT EMBRACE was less cheesy and had a much more interesting storyline, characters, and romance than the first two novels in the Dark-Hunter series.  NIGHT EMBRACE is the story of Talon, an immortal Celt, who (for nefarious reasons unknown to him) is reunited with the reincarnated soul of his dead wife, Nynia.  Nynia has been reborn as Sunshine Runningwolf, a modern-day starving artist.  Sunshine is the kind of heroine who is easy to relate to: she's made a few mistakes in life, yet she is also independent, realistic, and easy to get along with.  Her responses to Talon, a hunky vampire hunter, are genuine (I could imagine myself thinking those same thoughts if I met a guy like him).  Talon is also an interesting hero with an interesting back story, and you can really see him fall in love with Sunshine.  The best part of NIGHT EMBRACE, however, isn't the romance so much as it is the adventure that revolves around the secondary characters, which include the always fascinating Acheron, a psycho good guy named Zarek, and some were-creatures (not to mention the various Greek and Celtic gods).  Reading about these guys made me want to go out and buy the rest of the Dark-Hunter series, just to see what happens to them.  This is also impressive, because I had almost decided to give up on Kenyon as an author since her first two novels seemed WAY too dopey and silly to me.  NIGHT EMBRACE redeemed her, in my mind.  I'm looking forward to the next novel in the series, now.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-27

I was expecting something as cheesy as its cover art (the model is icky), but the book ended up being both engrossing and highly entertaining.  To summarize, Maggie is accidentally swept into the alternate realm of a reality video game, where she becomes the slave to a warrior named Kered who is on a quest to save his people from all-out war.  Sounds crazy, yes?  It's actually quite good, and the plot and characters are utterly engaging.  The story itself is well-written, and the author does a great job immersing you in the video game's world.  Plus, the ending is also satisfying and plausible.  If I had to complain, it's only to say that the actual love scenes are pretty abstract in detail ... and that's not a big complaint.  Anyway, I'm pleased to note that VIRTUAL HEAVEN is the first in a trilogy.  I can't wait to read the next one!	2005-02-20

First, it is set in 1920s Scotland, featuring a heroine who actually works for a living.  Second, her hero is a selkie, a gorgeous man who lives in the ocean and can transform into a seal with the aid of a magical pelt.  Third, the heroine not only accidentally calls the mythical hero into her life to be her lover, but she ends up being much more than he anticipates - she is, in fact, the means to help the dwindling selkie population survive. <br /> <br />I rather enjoyed the mythical aspects of THE SELKIE.  I had no idea what a selkie was until I read this book, which also features fairies who can't cry and evil mermaids.  Plus, Jackson easily incorporates the myths into the story, making you accept that a \\"modern girl\\" like Hexy doesn't need too much convincing to believe in magic and other-worldly creatures (or monsters).   <br /> <br />There were two things, however, that I had issues with.  One, Jackson uses bizarre \\"big\\" words throughout the story, which were jarring (did she have to choose the hardest-to-pronounce words from a thesaurus to add variety to her prose?).  Second, I couldn't help but wonder how much Hexy and Ruairidh really loved each other.  From what I understood, he had a special aphrodisiac on his skin that made Hexy all hot and bothered (she actually becomes obsessed with him), whereas Hexy became vital to the selkies for her special breeding capabilities, and not because they liked her personality or anything.  These two factors combined made me wonder: if Ruairidh wasn't a walking sex drug and if Hexy were a normal human girl, would their attraction have gone anywhere? <br /> <br />Regardless of these issues, I still enjoyed THE SELKIE.  It is well written and reads almost like a fairy tale, yet the heroine is pretty modern.  The world that Jackson creates is fascinating, whether it is human or selkie or mermaid (and finman), and the story doesn't drag.  In fact, I was so interested I read it in one afternoon.  Plus, the selkie, Ruairidh, is a unique hero in a story that stands alone among myth-themed romances. <br /> <br />For those interested in other romances featuring mythical sea creatures, I recommend THE LAST MERMAID by Shane Abe (four beautiful stories) or GODDESS OF THE SEA by P.C. Cast (a fun mermaid switch-a-roo).   <br /> <br />	2005-02-19

BEAUDRY'S GHOST is one of the most well thought out romances I've read in a long time.  In some ways, it doesn't even read like a romance, though it is so fascinating I barely noticed.  Set in modern times, BEAUDRY'S GHOST is the story of a Civil War reenactment gone bad when ghosts of soldiers past possess living men to once again commit the heinous murder of captured Union soldier Jared Beaudry.  This time, however, Jared intends to die with his honor intact so he can rest in peace rather than haunt the Southern coast as a headless, limbless ghost.  Jared also has a heroine to help him, a girl named Taylor who has her own ghosts to face as she battles Jared's captors.  Jared and Taylor are likable, sympathetic lead characters, and the plot is fast-paced and engrossing (not to mention bursting with Civil War history).  I could barely make myself put the book down.  The ending is satisfying and plausible, and rather exciting as it leaves room for a sequel.  I highly recommend BEAUDRY'S GHOST as an enjoyable, vastly entertaining read.  If you are looking for a good romantic ghost story, this is it!  PS. You can buy an electronic version at LTDBooks.com.	2005-02-15

Both the hero (a sarcastic drunk of an Earl) and heroine (his nave, lovesick stalker) are fantastic.  Letty has to be the most klutzy, accident-prone, and oblivious heroine ever.  The fact that she is so sweet and vulnerable makes it even funnier!  You can't help but laugh every time poor, beleaguered Richard (the Earl of Downe) becomes the victim of all her disastrous attempts to help him.  He's shot, tossed down a cliff, attacked by a cow, and more!  Plus, her dog, Gus, is a good nemesis for Richard.  If I had to complain about DREAMING, I'd have to say I would have liked more hanky panky and could have done without the highway robbery scene tacked on at the end....  Still, the book is a joy to read.  I think that's mostly because Letty is a seriously fun heroine - kinda like the little girl with the crush who everyone laughs at as a kid, yet grows up to become everyone's best friend AND gets the cute boy she's always liked in the end.    PS. DREAMING is a sequel to the novel, BEWITCHING, which is where we are first introduced to Richard and Letty.  Out of the two books, DREAMING is far superior.	2005-02-14

I thought it had a lot of potential; unfortunately, the author didn't go the distance.  The plot of the story is intriguing: the heroine, Tracy, has lived 8 lives, each one ended quite abruptly due to love.  Now Tracy is given one more chance to live a long and fulfilling life on earth.  However, that means not falling in love.  Unfortunately, she's sent back to live on a ranch in 1800s Montana, and the ranch foreman is a hunk of a cowboy who Tracy can't resist.  While Tracy has 8 former lives that she remembers (including being a modern-day ad executive, a maid from medieval England, and an Irish passenger on the Titanic), she barely if ever uses her past experiences or memories (other than from the 1990s).  That's disappointing, considering this is a story about reincarnation (and what prompted me to purchase it).  What's more disappointing, however, is Tracy's attitude when she wakes up to her new life in Montana.  Some readers might enjoy her sarcasm and bossiness; I, however, found her irritating and tiresome.  She was neither ideal nor endearing a heroine to me.  I actually had a difficult time trying to determine what Seth (the hero) or Richard (the anti-hero) saw in her to love.  Both Seth and Richard were interesting characters.  I wouldn't have minded seeing more \\"showdowns\\" between them.  The resolution with Richard stumped me, though.  I read it over 3 or 4 times, and still didn't quite believe that it was so ... anticlimactic.  Also, it was never explained why she went backwards in time to Montana, which was so pivotal and vital to the plotline.  That's not a good ending, in my opinion.	2005-02-14

I'm not complaining, mind you.  I'm just warning you that there is A LOT of intimacy in this book.  Some of it is very exciting - to the point where you don't want to read this book in public for fear of embarrassing yourself.  Yet, sometimes, the sexual descriptions are so detailed it's almost clinical (and sadly humorous, to boot).      I personally enjoyed DEMON'S DAUGHTER.  It's the first book I've read by Emma Holly, and it has made me curious to read more.  DEMON'S DAUGHTER takes place in an alternate world, sort of a Victorian England thriving with both humans and a technologically superior race called the Yama that feed off of human energy.  The heroine, Roxy, is half Yamish (or, half demon), while her hero, Adrian, is a cop who is something of an outcast among his fellow humans for having Yamish implants that make him super-strong.  Accident throws them together, while social and racial issues try to break them part.      I thought Roxy and Adrian were both well rounded, intriguing characters who (demons aside) actually seemed realistic.  My only complaint would be Adrian is the only hero I've ever read about who blushes over everything, non-stop (he is the exact opposite of a bodice-ripping, chauvinistic warrior-type), while Roxy's initial resentment and anger toward her Yamish father seem overblown.  Other than that, DEMON'S DAUGHTER was fun to read.  Adrian is quite probably the most inoffensive hero EVER to grace a romance novel (he's a real sweetie), and while there is some colorful language used in this book, overall it's still pretty tasteful and quite exciting to read.  Just remember, this book is all about the love scenes.  If that doesn't bother you, then you'll be sure to enjoy this most unusual, most unique love story. PS. Will Charles get his own story?    ***For a similar read, try Melanie Jackson's romantic Goblin City series, which begins with TRAVELER.  It's an alternate universe, set in the US, in which characters are half-fairy and are fighting underground goblins who are trying to takeover the world.***	2005-02-05

She was endearing, probably because she had absolutely no control of her magical powers.  The magical mayhem that she caused every time she sneezed was hysterical.  Joy was an enjoyable heroine - vulnerable yet strong, magical yet klutzy, sweet yet vindictive when she wanted to be - as well as original.  How many romance novel heroines have a weasel for a pet and can make it shower pink rose petals the moment she reaches sexual satisfaction?    That said, I was a bit irritated by Alec, her Duke and husband.  Alec was angry the entire novel.  Which got on my nerves.  A lot.  I think his temper tantrums also made the book drag a bit.  You knew whenever Joy cast a spell, he was going to freak out and she was going to have to apologize.  It happened too many times to count.    Another problem I had with BEWITCHING was its lack of clarity.  I read a lot, have a couple degrees in English literature, and know my way around poetry and prose pretty well, especially those guys who require some effort to read, like Joyce and Faulkner.  So I'm no novice when it comes to reading comprehension.  But this was the first book I read that I actually said \\"huh?\\" when it came to trying to remember who was who (especially with Alec's pals) and what in the world the characters were referring to in their jokes about (obviously forgotten by me) events that occurred in earlier chapters.  I mean, I thought the author was an able and entertaining writer, but I think she needed to work a bit on making sure the readers are as clear as she is on what's going on in the story.    Anyway, gripes aside, I'd still recommend BEWITCHING as a lovely romance to read.  Joy is a real sweetheart of a character, with a clever personality and undaunted spirit.  She was someone I could care about.  Which is worth the read.    PS.  BEWITCHING has a sequel called DREAMING, which is about the Earl and his lovesick stalker.  It's hysterically funny and a lot better than BEWITCHING.	2005-01-31

I'm embarrassed to say I was pretty dang spooked, too, and didn't even want to turn off the lights.  I can't believe a romance novel scared me! <br /> <br />GENTLE FROM THE NIGHT is my first gothic romance, and I rather enjoyed it.  I'll definitely be re-reading it.  The author's writing style is clean and creative, and I found her characters to be compelling, especially the dastardly hero, Damian.  He was definitely drawn to the \\"dark side\\" of life - and I have to admit, I liked him all the more for it. <br /> <br />This dark story revolves around Alexandra, a Jewess who is hired to care for Damian's idiot brother, Samuel, in attempt to make Samuel speak.  You see, Samuel has been struck silent by fear - fear of a woman whose evil still haunts both Samuel and his cold-hearted brother Damian. <br /> <br />What I liked most about this book was its suspense.  As in: Is Ursula a ghost?  Is Damian crazy?  Who is trying to hurt Alexandra?  And when will Damian and Alexandra finally hook up? <br /> <br />What I liked least was the good vs. evil speeches scattered throughout the book and Alexandra's overblown reactions to Damian toward the end.  I still can't believe, after having spent the entire night with him doing the nasty, she wakes up and strikes him with a brush for - of all things - trying to kiss her.  Then SHE goes on to lecture HIM for being depraved and cruel!!!   <br /> <br />Anyway, I highly recommend GENTLE FROM THE NIGHT as one of the more entertaining reads I've encountered.  It has horror, suspense, romance, and both a fascinating hero and heroine.  I think I like it mostly for Damian.  He's one of the most intriguing guys I've read about in a while. <br />	2005-01-26

To summarize, it is the story of a 25-year old military girl named CC whose plane crashes in the ocean and whose life is saved by a mermaid.  The catch?  The mermaid and CC switch bodies, leaving CC to deal with a malicious, unwanted suitor whose evilness forces CC to seek the aid of a goddess.  CC gets swept away (literally) into the past, where she is saved by a knight in shining armor, yet she pines for the love of a handsome merman.      GODDESS OF THE SEA is a unique and original romance, and CC is an enjoyable character who catches your attention.  A story like this could have been overbearingly cheesy, but I feel the author succeeds in creating an alternative world revolving around the myth of the mermaid.  One complaint I had is that there's a lot of redundancy in this book.  In fact, the author appears to enjoy pounding you on the head with her messages that 1) women are great & have magic & need to stick together - girl-power and feminism just aren't my thing - and 2) the hero will wait for CC for an eternity (Okay, I got it the first time.  It doesn't have to be repeated another 2,000 times).  Ironically, while the author is overbearing with her themes and foreshadowing, she can be vague in other situations - for instance, the resolution with the abbot needed more explanation.      I also have to admit that I would have liked things with Sean to have turned out different...When the goddess kept asking CC if she was sure about being in love with the merman, my thoughts kept going back to Sean.  Oh well.    Regardless, I would recommend GODDESS OF THE SEA as a light, entertaining read.  While I wouldn't suggest reading it on an airplane (trust me), you may want to take it to the beach somewhere, in hopes of catching glimpse of a gorgeous merman of your own.    For those interested in mermaid romances, THE LAST MERMAID by Shana Abe is a beautiful, poetic novel about four different mermaids and their mortal lovers.	2005-01-24

The man who loves her, a young preacher named Duncan, dies to save her.  While she waits for Duncan to be reborn (300 years later), Raven is pursued by a dark witch who can only gain immortality by stealing the heart of a white witch.   <br /> <br />ETERNITY deals with the horror of witch trials and the murder of innocent women, so don't expect a light-hearted story.  Though well written and engrossing, it does tend to be a bit melodramatic at times, especially with the foreshadowing and declarations of love.  Still, I liked it very much, from its first-person narrative (different for a romance novel) to its lovely descriptions of how Raven uses her magic powers.  There are no cheesy jokes or banter, no overblown action scenes, and no vulgar love scenes - in other words, a breath of fresh air among the many (unrealistic) paranormal romances out there. <br /> <br />ETERNITY is the first in a series.  I'm definitely going to read the next book!!! <br />	2005-01-19

Sad to say, the book actually reminded me of a poorly scripted, poorly acted made-for-TV movie on the Sci-Fi channel.  NIGHT PLEASURES is the story of vampire hunter Kyrian, who must face his torturous past to help protect Amanda, a mortal sorceress, from being killed by a demigod. Amanda, in the meantime, strives to help Kyrian, a vampire himself, regain his soul.  While the plot itself is not bad, the way it's written is.  A lot of the story is cheesy, especially the action sequences (which feature somersaults and lame one-liners).  In fact, the only thing I liked about NIGHT PLEASURES was Acheron, the fascinating Dark Hunter leader (judging from the author's website, it looks like there's going to be a book about him published in 2007).     Anyway, NIGHT PLEASURES is book #1 in the Dark-Hunter series, set in modern times. However, it would be helpful to read its prologue, FANTASY LOVER (which I enjoyed immensely).  I also liked book #2 in the Dark-Hunter series, NIGHT EMBRACE, and am looking forward to reading book #3.	2005-01-17
US	50810207	R2BA2BKNEOIW4G	0425196844	300331712	Jane's Warlord (Berkley Sensation)	Books	3	14	18	N	N	Interesting Premise, But Too Raw for Me	I honestly don't know how I feel about JANE'S WARLORD.  Plot-wise, it was entertaining: a genetically engineered warrior from 300 years in the future is ordered to catch a serial killer as he stalks his last victim, a reporter named Jane.  Character-wise, it was intriguing: Baran the warlord had a tragic, lonely past; Jane the reporter was spunky; and Baran's partner was a genetically engineered talking timber wolf.  Romance-wise?  Well, I'm not sure if it was romantic, per se.  It's supposed to be erotica so, yes, they were intimate, and quite often.  Like dogs in heat, almost.  Even the author called it \\"f***ing\\" every single time.  The carnal vulgarity was a put off, as were the redundant sex scenes and the overuse of the word \\"cream.\\"  I think I'm going to ban that word from my vocabulary now.  Anyway, while I liked how the author wrote Jane's very human character, I thought she (the author) was a bit immature in how she used the wolf.  He's supposed to be this genius, yet all he does is crack lewd comments and cat jokes.  I mean, he's a friggin talking wolf!  Come on!  You'd think he'd have something better to say.  Worse, Jane calls him \\"wolfie\\" and \\"furball,\\" which is just so trite.  I would never EVER call my husky (resembles a wolf) or my rottweiler (as intimidating as one) a \\"furball.\\"  I guess Jane really is a cat person.   <br /> <br />So, going back to my original point, I really don't know if I like or dislike JANE'S WARLORD.  On the good side, it was original, engrossing, and fun to read.  On the bad side, it was borderline cheesy, skimmed over some important plot areas, and was more kinky porno than romance.  Maybe I'm just too used to witty, sensual Johanna Lindsey novels (my favorite) to appreciate fully something more gritty and raw, like JANE'S WARLORD.  I don't know.  I do recommend it as a fascinating read, but I don't think it will appeal to those looking for a traditional heartwarming romance full of love and adventure. <br /> <br />	2005-01-12

It was cute and silly, and quite fun to read.  The premise of the story is, in the year 2020, reluctant white witch Tabitha gets zapped 700 years into the past by her mother's magic amulet and into the life of beleaguered Scottish knight Colin of Ravenwood.  In his company, she does everything from being imprisoned in a cold, dark dungeon to facing a mythical monster in battle.  Very fairytale-ish, indeed.  I enjoyed Tabitha's dealings with medieval folk and her accidents with magic (as well as all her sarcasm and one-liners).  I also thought that Colin, a chivalrous knight devoted to God, was an intriguing hero.   <br /> <br />TOUCH OF ENCHANTMENT is the sequel to BREATH OF MAGIC, which is about Tabitha's parents.  I enjoyed both books immensely.  Each has enjoyable characters and its own unique time-travel storyline.  My advice is to read them both, in order.  They are great fun and have wacky senses of humor! <br /> <br />	2005-01-10

It is also the first romance novel that made me laugh so hard I was crying, especially during one spectacularly funny, completely humiliating scene involving condoms and four overprotective brothers.  I liked the author's breezy, open writing style.  She really made the character of Katie, a modern-day house renovator, seem totally real (in other words, Katie had a lot of the same thoughts I think I'd have if a gorgeous statue came to life and was revealed to be a magic-wielding he-man warrior from another planet).      That said, there were some issues I had with the story, the most important being that it reminded me too much of WARRIOR'S WOMAN by Johanna Lindsey (published in the 1990s).  Both involve modern-type girls with the ability to kick ass who fall in love with super-macho aliens (of the \\"women must submit and be protected\\" variety), and how each tempers the other.  Jorlan even refers to Katie at one point as a \\"warrior woman.\\"  Still, THE STONE PRINCE has its own unique plotline, so while it has some similarities to WARRIOR'S WOMAN, it reads quite differently.      Anyway, issues aside, I rather enjoyed this wacky, fantastical love story between a girl and her alien prince charming.  I mean, how can you resist a man who carries around a cooking spatula as a weapon?  My recommendation: read it!	2005-01-06

In fact, I'm planning to give it as birthday gifts to my young cousins (ages 12 to 16) who like to read.  I enjoyed it, and I'm almost 30.  To summarize, BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE is the angst-filled story of a teenage werewolf (Vivian) who falls in love with a human boy, which is against the traditions of the pack.  In the meanwhile, she must deal with real-life issues like the death of her father, moving, making new friends and fitting in, and dealing with the fact that her family (the pack) is growing apart.  Among the werewolf parts of the story is a fascinating contest to see who will be the new alpha male leading the pack, and how he acquires his mate.  I thought all of the characters were intriguing and the story to be well written, and I ended up reading the entire book in about two hours.  I also couldn't help but root for the boy I wanted Vivian to end up with, and was so pleased when she did!  Thoroughly engaging, BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE isn't just a romantic werewolf fantasy (this is not a horror novel); it is also a coming-of-age story.  Parents please note that there is quite a bit of sexual tension in this book, as well as the use of some profanity (though most is in line with canine references).	2005-01-04

The photos are striking, and almost all the birds in the photos are discussed individually in the reader-friendly text.  The author knows how to make bird facts fascinating.  Every once in a while, I had to put down the book just so I could share with others whatever amazing bit of information I had learned about birds.  <br /> <br />I'll be honest and admit I didn't find LIFE OF BIRDS as engaging a read as LIFE OF MAMMALS, which is also by the same author.  But I think that's because I'm a big cat and wolf type of person, not a bird person at all.  I've never been particularly interested in birds, and only bought LIFE OF BIRDS because I thought LIFE OF MAMMALS was fantastic.  Though I did thoroughly enjoy LIFE OF BIRDS, it took me longer to read it (discussions about aerodynamics are not my thing).  The best thing I liked about LIFE OF BIRDS were the photos, many of which were pretty gross, showing birds eating monkeys, snakes eating birds, birds eating poop, etc.  Everyone loved gawking at those.  <br />	2005-01-03

Plot-wise, it is about a Scottish lady seeking a husband with the assistance of a handsome ghost.  Unfortunately, said ghost is the man of her dreams!  I read this simply because I was in the mood for a ghostly romance, and this was the first book I found with that theme (though it is out of print, so I had to buy a used edition).  As a ghost story, A PHANTOM AFFAIR is not at all spooky (nor did I want it to be).  It dealt more with the frustrations of two people who want to be together, yet to touch is impossible.  I also grew very curious to see how the story would end - would she marry a living man or would they somehow find a way to be man and wife, even though he was a ghost?  Since this was the first Zebra Regency Romance I've ever read, I really can't compare it, say, to a traditional romance novel (like Johanna Lindsey) or even a paranormal romance (like Sherrilyn Kenyon).  I can say that the author's constant use of Victorian(?) jargon caught me off guard (e.g., \\"bosom-bow,\\" for \\"best friend\\" - I think).  I also was astounded at how quickly the hero was killed off -within moments of meeting the heroine.  Finally, I had hoped for a little more steamy passion, but I don't think Zebra romances are that type of novel.  Anyway, I did enjoy reading A PHANTOM AFFAIR; it was sweet and had several truly witty moments.  I'll definitely read it again, though I'll probably keep a dictionary by my side this time, so I can better understand the dialogue.	2004-12-28

The Story Didn't Work for Me	TOUCH OF THE WOLF is a pedestrian effort.  The story - about an American werewolf who goes to England to find her family - is choppy, with holes here and there in the plot, quotes way too much poetry, and is cast with characters who aren't that interesting.  The heroine, Cassidy, is not very endearing - she's irritatingly nave (my eyeballs are rolling right now) and is way too desperate to find love.  She also fixates on Braden right from the start, though I don't know why exactly, other than he is the first werewolf she meets.  I thought Braden was more flushed out a character than Cassidy or his two siblings. His handicap was promising, though there seemed to be a lot of moments in the book where, superhuman senses aside, the author seemed to forget he WAS handicapped.  The story also seemed to suffer from moody melodrama and a need to make a secret out of EVERYTHING.  I understand that TOUCH OF THE WOLF is the first of a trilogy, the other two books following the stories of Braden's siblings (an annoying ice queen named Rowena and a cowardly trickster named Quentin).  I'm not quite sure I want to bother with their stories.  The reason I read TOUCH OF THE WOLF is because I adored TO CATCH A WOLF, which is about Cassidy's brother, Morgan.  I'm pretty disappointed that Cassidy's story was so dopey.  Oh well.       Update as of Jan 4, 2005: I just read a young adult novel called BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE that dealt with many of the same topics as TOUCH OF THE WOLF, including real-life issues such as fitting in, dealing with the loss of family, etc., as well as werewolf issues like determining the leader of the pack and the rules associated with breeding/mating.  I have to say the teen book, BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE, was a lot more sophisticated than TOUCH OF THE WOLF in every respect and was a much more engaging read.  BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE was shorter and set in modern times with a angst-filled heroine and, while it didn't have the full-blown love scenes found in a romance novel, it had a sexually-tense love triangle that was fun and exciting to read about.	2004-12-24

So what if he's something of a recluse?  So what if he is obsessed with magic - to the point of risking his personal and professional reputation?  So what if his heart is as cold as his icy eyes?  Tristan is determined never to be hurt by anyone, even though he is the loneliest of souls.      Enter Arian, a 17th century Puritan witch (white witch, of course).  Escaping an angry mob determined to drown her, Arian literally flies in on a broomstick and crash lands on Tristan's doorstep in the 1990s - in the middle of a press conference!  What is it about this wacky, lovely witch that finally melts Tristan's heart?    I enjoyed this book.  For a time-travel romance, it is pretty refreshing to have the guy be the modern-day hero and the girl be the fantasy lover from a different time and place.  Also, Arian's curiosity with the modern world is fun.  I loved how she practically flooded the building with her fascination over the \\"chamber pot.\\"    I also thought it was refreshing to see a romance novel heroine insisting on being married before \\"fornicating.\\"  I have to say, having a Puritan heroine was an unusual treat.  You never knew what she was going to say or do (or dress).      Finally, BREATH OF MAGIC comes with an enjoyable cast of characters.  Tristan is an ice prince, but he tugs at your heart.  Arian is a delight, and characters like the Indian Copperfield and Norwegian bodyguard Sven are a hoot.  Even the cat familiar is cute.    I say, definitely read this book.  It is the second TM book I've read (I also enjoyed CHARMING THE PRINCE), and I've found I like her style.  She has a different take on fairytale stories and her writing is sweet and witty.  I understand that BREATH OF MAGIC also has a sequel called TOUCH OF ENCHANTMENT, which I've already ordered and am looking forward to reading.	2004-12-20

In one sentence, it's about a modern-day sex therapist who, as a joke, beckons forth gorgeous Julian of Macedon (the mortal son of Aphrodite) to serve her as a love slave - and when he actually appears, what she goes through to help him break the curse.    Yeah, it has some incredibly cheesy moments, but I liked those moments simply because I liked the book.  I think it's the first romance I've ever read that had an Ancient Greek (or rather, Macedonian) hero and dealt with Greek mythology.  That alone made it a worthwhile read (as opposed to the millions of cookie-cutter romances about the ton, pirates, Vikings, knights, Native Americans, etc.).  I think the dopiest moments in FANTASY LOVER are when the modern-day heroine utters \\"Holy guacamole!\\"  The best, however, revolve around Julian, the 2,000-year old general-turned-love-slave who is trapped by a curse to serve the women who summon him.  He is, in turns, gorgeously wicked and painfully vulnerable.  I loved how the author let us into his psyche (no pun intended), letting us see just how tormented and lonely he is.  And just how much he loves Grace.    Grace was a good heroine.  She is described as slightly unattractive, but she is so great to him that I never even noticed.  When her looks were insulted, I was just as outraged as Julian.  The author did a fantastic job of making Grace a most sympathetic, easy-to-relate-to heroine.  I imagine her as someone I'd actually like to be friends with.    A couple of footnotes.  FANTASY LOVER is apparently a \\"prologue\\" to the Dark-Hunter series, which I have never read.  From the reviews, however, the books in the Dark-Hunter series are a lot better than FANTASY LOVER.  This was good news for me, because I will definitely now begin reading the series.    And, yes, there are some bizarre plotlines and coincidences in FANTASY LOVER.  The Greek gods also have no problem using American slang.  And there is a serious obsession with sex in this book (Julian IS a love slave).  But, you know what, I forgave all that (which, for the record, I rarely do - just see my review of KISS OF THE HIGHLANDER or some of Johanna Lindsey's books for proof).  There was something about FANTASY LOVER that charmed me, regardless its problems.  Maybe it was the writing style.  Or the fun characters.  Or the fact that it's about Greek gods.  I don't know.  I think you'll just have to read it and decide for yourself.  Have fun!  I did.    ***For similar stories, read THE PLEASURE SLAVE by Gena Showalter or TIGER EYE by Marjorie M. Liu.***	2004-12-17

Incorporating four magical love stories in one, THE LAST MERMAID begins with a mermaid's tragic curse of lost love, then moves to the first story, which is about a betrayed King of Scotland who is rescued from a watery grave by Ione, the lonely siren of the cursed island of Kell.  This segment was packed with medieval adventure (Scottish warriors against Saxon thugs), and I thought Aeden was a fantastic hero, though Ione the mermaid bugged me at first for being so needy (I grew to like her, especially toward the end, when she risked all for Aeden).  Following this story, we move ahead to the 1700s, in which Ione and Aeden's descendant, the male siren Ronan (Earl of Kell), is targeted for death by a beautiful Spanish assassin named Leila (who has some magic of her own).  Ronan and Leila's story is filled with intrigue and painful attraction (I couldn't wait for them to FINALLY hook up).  However, I think I liked the last story the best, which begins in modern-day Los Angeles.  The heroine, half-Japanese Ruri, has just inherited the Island of Kell (which she didn't even know existed) and is \\"seduced\\" into visiting it by Iain, a hot pirate-like Scot who wants to buy it.  Their story wraps up the four (yes, four) romances quite nicely, with just a little magic twist.  For a romance novel, THE LAST MERMAID is prettily written (you can practically taste the saltwater and see the island in your mind), though the author sometimes overdoes it (she has a certain obsession for eye and hair color).  The actual lovemaking scenes are also elegant, meaning they are less steamy and more romantic.  Overall, I thought this was a lovely novel, eloquent and satisfying, and would recommend it to anyone interested in adding a touch of magic to her day.  <br /> <br />	2004-12-14

At first, I was a little hesitant to read it, unsure if I wanted to read about a hero with kids (over 10 of them!).  However, the kids make this story - starting from the first chapter in which we are introduced to Lord Bannor, who is being pursued by the evil enemy (namely, his children).  The author had fun with this tongue-in-cheek story, not only in her descriptions of Willow's responses to her new family, but also how she treats Bannor's past and Willow's relatives, as well as Bannor's refusal to make love for fear of producing new children.  I particularly liked how Bannor forgets which arm he's been injured on while Willow lovingly nurses his arrow wound.  The only thing I didn't like was Willow's miracle recovery at the end - I actually found myself getting teary-eyed at the thought of her hurt, then - bam! - she's completely OK.  That came off as too false and quick a resolution for me.  But, overall, I enjoyed \\"Charming the Prince\\" immensely.  I highly recommend it as a light, sweet fairytale of a romance.	2004-12-05
US	50810207	R2DF6NHPBKF1RD	0553293168	675345837	Ravished	Books	3	6	10	N	N	Pleasant Story of a Scarred Hero and Quirky Heroine	\\"Ravished\\" was a quick read.  I thought Gideon was an interesting hero; he's scarred both physically and mentally.  Harriett had a unique hobby for a romance novel heroine - that of fossil collecting - but as a character, she didn't grow much (if at all) throughout the novel.  She is obsessed with her fossils throughout the entire book, and while it is amusing, she never once thinks about the consequences of her actions (although she does the same thing over and over, always getting her into trouble).  I did appreciate her loyalty and faith in Gideon, though.  That was heartwarming.  Altogether, the story was sweet, the plot predictable, the characters mostly one-dimensional (bad guys bad for no real reason, family members flat, etc.), the dialogue wordy, and the love scenes redundant - though everything was well-written.  \\"Pleasant\\" is the word that comes to mind when describing this book.  It wasn't one of those books that made me want to rush out and buy another Amanda Quick novel to read.  It was more like I finished it (at a reasonable hour), turned off the lights, and went to bed, without another thought on the matter at all.	2004-12-04
US	50810207	RVGN5RMH8SLFK	044023655X	631228888	Kiss of the Highlander (The Highlander Series, Book 4)	Books	1	18	30	N	N	Crude and Unoriginal	I purchased this book based on the glowing reviews - and was let down completely.  Obviously, I am one of the few people who didn't like \\"Kiss of the Highlander.\\"  Why?  First, it was crude.  Too crude.  I didn't find the horny heroine's quest to lose her virginity very endearing.  She came off as way too desperate, and her \\"cherry picker\\" references became more annoying with every citation.  Who in the world calls it a \\"cherry,\\" anyway?  Plus, Ms. Moning's choice words for the male anatomy sounded more like something you'd hear in a porno than in a romance novel.  Second, the storyline was a rip-off of better time travel novels.  \\"A Knight in Shining Armor\\" by Jude Deveraux is a trillion times better than \\"Kiss of the Highlander\\" and was written long before it.  In fact, \\"Kiss\\" follows the plot of \\"A Knight\\" almost word-for-word.  Hunky warrior from Great Britain's past appears in modern times.  Girl thinks he's crazy, but takes him shopping and shows him modern appliances.  Hot sex follows.  Girl ends up going back in time to a point in the warrior's past in which he does not remember her or the fact that they are in love.  She has to make him remember, all the while exclaiming over what it's like to live in the past.  More sex.  Then she gets transported back to her own time - without him again - until they magically find one another.  The only difference between \\"A Knight\\" and \\"Kiss\\" is that the hero in \\"Kiss\\" is a spell-casting Druid and the heroine is a physicist who, in her younger years, discovered a means to create weapons of mass destruction (adding, of course, to the ridiculousness of the story). <br /> <br />\\"Kiss\\" has a sequel called \\"Dark Highlander,\\" which I think is better written, more engaging, and has better characters (in \\"Dark,\\" the brooding hero is cursed and must find a way to break it before evil takes over his body).  You don't even have to read \\"Kiss\\" to understand \\"Dark Highlander.\\"  My suggestion is to read \\"Dark Highlander\\" and \\"A Knightin Shining Armor\\" and to avoid \\"Kiss of the Highlander\\" completely. <br /> <br />	2004-12-04

The writing was crisp and elegant, and the story itself had interesting characters and a creative setting.  I also understand it is part of a series, of which I am sure to read.    Set in Colorado in the late 1800s, \\"To Catch\\" revolves around two love triangles.  The first includes ex-convict Morgan Holt (a werewolf who wants nothing to do with humans), crippled socialite Athena (a repressed werewolf), and snake charmer Tamar (a voluptuous circus freak with reptile skin).  The second love triangle includes ruthless businessman Niall (Athena's human half-brother), horse tamer Caitlin (a pixy of a circus performer), and social climber Cecily (scheming her way up through false friendship).      The heroes are Morgan and Athena, who struggle to accept their love for one another.  Their challenges are more mental in nature: Morgan was imprisoned for a crime he cannot forget while Athena is not only crippled in body, but also in spirit, and doesn't even realize it.  This is a story about how love heals all types of wounds.    I thoroughly enjoyed Morgan.  Krinard's descriptions of him, as either man or wolf, were beautifully sad, savage, and majestic.  As for the heroine - at first, I was annoyed with Athena and all her self-serving charities, but as her inner wolf began to show, I began to soften toward her.  I couldn't wait for them to finally come together.    Although I really enjoyed this book, there were a couple things that bothered me.  For one, while Krinard writes elegantly and rather creatively, she also tended to overwrite, resulting in some scenes and dialogue that dragged a bit.  She also \\"overwrote\\" a couple characters, too, especially Niall, who started off as a great anti-hero, but ended up a crazy jerk (though I think we're supposed to like him; after all, Caitlin did).  Another major problem I had was with Morgan's secret.  When it was finally revealed, I did not think his crime was worth all the guilt and unhappiness heaped upon him.      However, I was pleased to see that these werewolves were not the ugly, murderous monsters you see in the movies.  Most of the time, as werewolves, Morgan and Athena wander around in wolf form, doing wolf things, like running with the pack, mating for life, etc.  Very romantic.	2004-12-03

Its immediate prequel is \\"Kiss of the Highlander,\\" though \\"Dark\\" can be read alone.  The author, Moning, doesn't rely on back-story to make \\"Dark\\" flow, which is great for first time readers.      \\"Dark\\" revolves around Dageus, the MacKeltar twin with black hair falling down to his waist and gold eyes.  Dageus also has a secret: he has 13 evil Druids inside him, just waiting for him to lose control of his magical power so that they can use his body to destroy the world.    In \\"Dark,\\" Moning creates a character in Dageus that is very attractive, and not just because he is gorgeous.  He is honorable and lonely, yet he reeks of a predatory sexual dominance that has every female character in the story drawn to him like bees to nectar.  Plus, he has a dark side - which is always much, much more exciting than white knights and squeaky-clean heroes.      His heroine is Chloe, a Kansas \\"nerd\\" who now works in a museum in Manhattan tending to Celtic artifacts.  Dageus, who happened to be from the 16th Century Scotland, is by far the greatest, sexiest, and most dangerous artifact Chloe could ever hope to discover.  I personally didn't like Chloe that much - she just seemed too frumpy and nave a love interest for such an exciting guy, but oh well, I guess.  It is a fantasy.    Chloe's reactions to a man like Dageus, however, are very, very real.  There is definitely a sizzle to the numerous love scenes.  They are long, graphic, and not at all flowery.  It's Dageus' aggression and complete control of each sexual encounter that gives \\"Dark\\" its satisfying heat.      This is a story with many magical elements, a dark brooding hero, and an innocent modern heroine.  You don't need to read the rest of the series to understand it.  All you need is a desire to read about an interesting man pursued by evil both within and around him, the girl he loves, and his amazing abilities to move back and forth in time.	2004-11-29

It is peopled with the Maya, a culture rich in history yet suffering poverty, disease, and insignificance in modern times.  And in this world exists the jaguar, a powerful cat who is rarely seen and is not a man-eater, yet is hunted almost to extinction for its exquisite spotted fur and because, quite simply, people fear it.   <br /> <br />I read \\"Jaguar\\" in about 2 days, and fell completely in love with its spirit.  The author, a young scientist, struggled hard to successfully understand the lives of these cats within its world and to keep it alive, often to his own personal tragedies.  His description of the jungle is unromantic and riveting, as are the terrible hardships that go with it.  I will never forget all the diseases, snakes, and parasites than run amok in this story, practically characters of their own.  One lesson I came back with is how thankful I am to live in a country with exceptional sanitation and medical care.   <br /> <br />\\"Jaguar\\" is haunting.  You can't finish it without wishing to enter that dark, dangerous jungle of the majestic jaguar.  It draws out the adventurer in you.  It stirs your compassion. <br /> <br />	2004-11-29

Then, instead of falling right asleep, I stayed up another hour just going over this book in my mind.  It was simply incredible.  I've only read one other time-traveling romance before, and that was \\"Until Forever\\" by my favorite romance author Johanna Lindsey.  I had thought \\"Until Forever\\" was pretty good, but now I realize it simply sucks in comparison to \\"A Knight in Shining Armor.\\"  In fact, if I compared the two books to desserts, \\"Until Forever\\" would be a gingerbread cookie while \\"A Knight\\" would be a steaming chocolate souffl drizzled in hot chocolate and topped with powdered sugar and whipped cream.  It was that yummy! <br /> <br />The medieval hero, Nicholas, was amazing!  It was the little affectionate things he did that had me ga-ga over him, like how he planted Dougless (the heroine) with a joyously sweet kiss once he tasted ice cream for the first time.  Dougless was also fun; she didn't behave predictably and had personality quirks and clever come-backs that I had never really seen before in a romance novel heroine.  They didn't immediately become lovers, but I liked that so much, because it made me crazy anticipating when they finally would - and when they did, all I can say is WOW!  I had to reread what I was reading to make sure I had really read that. <br /> <br />For all my glowing praise, the book is not 100 percent perfect.  The first chapter describing Dougless' relationship with her boyfriend Robert and his bratty kid seemed over the top to the point where I started smirking, thinking the book was going to be totally lame.  Some of the women's lib stuff also felt forced.  But thank God I don't always go with first impressions!  I might have put this jewel down and not enjoyed a witty, magical story full of fascinating detail about medieval life and celebrating a love that spanned 400 years. <br /> <br />I am most definitely going to start reading Jude Deveraux now! <br />	2004-11-23
US	50810207	R2VDFNRTIQBBYL	0393326098	386506024	Monster of God: The Man-Eating Predator in the Jungles of History and the Mind	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Fascinating Scary Animals	Read this book if 1) You are interested in animals; 2) You are interested in exotic locales and different cultures; and 3) You have a tough stomach.    \\"Monster of God\\" is a fascinating look at dangerous \\"man-eating\\" animals throughout the world and how they interact with man.  It is also a travelogue written by a man obviously interested in detail, history, culture, and the inner-workings of the human mind.      Lions in India, crocoldiles in Australia, brown bears in Romania, and Siberian Tigers in Siberia are the main animals discussed in the book.  I thought, however, the most interesting part was the biography of the Romanian dictator, who killed so many bears for sport.  The bears are also the least scary of the predators described (you feel more sorry for them than threatened by them).    This book is loaded with information (sometimes it can get overwelming), and the overall read is fascinating -- including every little gory detail.  Probably the most intriguing moment of the entire book is the description of a crocodile attack, as related by a survivor.  It gave me chills.  I don't think I'll ever forget it.    The main message of \\"Monster of God\\" is that even though we fear them and they can kill us, these animals -- all animals, actually -- are important to this world we share.  If we are not careful, they will disappear -- and we will have lost so much because of it.	2004-11-21

The text is easy to read, though I do admit I had to make a short list of words to look up in the dictionary (and I'm an English major and a professional editor.  Gasp!).  The text is also extremely engaging.  As I read \\"Life of Mammals,\\" I found myself stopping to share bits and pieces of what Attenborough wrote with various family members, usually starting the conversation with, \\"This is amazing!  Did you know...?\\"  Attenborough devotes a lot of rich detail to the descriptions and histories of animals he choses to cover, all fascinating.  There were times when I yearned for more, though I realize you can't devote too many pages to one animal when you're trying to discuss 50 or so different species in one 200+ page book.  He also tried to incorporate at least one photograph of each animal he discussed, which I appreciated so much.  The photos, by the way, are gorgeous.  My boyfriend's 10-year old sister and I spent one hour simply looking at the photographs and discussing each, which was fun for us both.  I enjoyed this book so much that I just bought \\"Life of Birds,\\" also by Attenborough, and am looking forward to reading it, too.	2004-11-01

The author, McCarthy, lays out compelling arguements about the learning capabilities and intelligence of animals (which I've never questioned, by the way, having had pets all my life).  More, McCarthy does so in an easy to read, witty (wink-wink) writing style that had me laughing out loud over and over again, often in tears.  In fact, I brought this book with me to Hawaii as my \\"beach book,\\" and quite honestly, I was more engaged in reading it than in enjoying beautiful Waikiki.  I also brought it to the dentist, which was a mistake, because I ended up bursting into uncontrollable giggles in the waiting room after reading a particuarly hysterical account of animals trying to mate.  People were staring at me while I tried desperately hard not to laugh, which only made me laugh harder.  They probably thought I was on drugs.  I was most certainly enjoying this book!!!  My favorite stories (and there are hundreds of stories, by the way) include the chimp that wages war against an electrical socket, the dolphin that scrapes algae off its aquarium with a sea slug, and the aforementioned mating chapter (the tigers are especially amusing).  I can't tell you how many times I've read these particular jewels to friends and family.  The first chapter may feel a little \\"academic\\" as you read it but, trust me, the dry discussions about the theory of so-and-so quickly end, leaving 200+ plages of fascinating animal behavior.  FYI: When I bought this book, I also bought David Attenborough's \\"Life of Mammals,\\" which ended up being a great help since \\"Life of Mammals\\" has beautiful color pictures and descriptions of many of the animals that \\"Becoming\\" talks about, like macaques (which I had never heard of before).	2004-11-01

It's not awful, but neither it is a page-turner.  \\"All's\\" story is straightforward enough: Damian hires a bounty hunter to find his father's murderer only to fall for the bounty hunter, a girl named Casey who is determined to succeed at a man's job to prove to her her father that she can run a rannch.  What the story lacks is passion.  So much time is spent on discussing the murder and chasing the bad guy that the romance part comes up short.  I didn't devour this book, like I did it's prequel, the marvelous \\"A Heart So Wild.\\"  I wish Casey & Damian of \\"All\\" had half the passion that Chandos & Courtney of \\"A Heart\\" had. I also wish the \\"bad situations\\" that Casey found herself in really seemed threatening, but both her showdown and kidnapping were predictable and not at all exciting.  Big sigh.  Worse was the tacked-on ending revolving around Damian's mother.  Lindsey seems to love having belated parent-child reunions in her books (\\"Angel,\\" \\"So Speaks the Heart,\\" \\"Defy Not the Heart\\" to name a few).  I'd recommend reading \\"A Heart So Wild\\" over reading \\"All I Need Is You.\\" \\"A Heart\\" is a prime example of a REAL steamy, sexy Western romance,  while \\"All\\" (with it's lack of charisma and excitement) is more a girl-oriented murder-mystery than romance.	2004-09-25

It was very sweet.   <br /> <br />My favorite JLs are the ones with adventure, steamy banter, and searing passion.  \\"The Heir\\" doesn't have any of these qualities, yet it was still a captivating read.  What it does have is a realistic approach to romance.  Here are two young people (the hero is 21, the heroine younger) finding love with the girl/boy next door.  That's what happened to me in real life (and at the same age).  Just like Duncan with Sabrina, I was initially attracted to my honey because he made me laugh.  And again, just like Duncan and Sabrina, it only took me a week to know I wanted to be with him forever. <br /> <br />My personal experience aside, \\"The Heir\\" had many fine qualities.  The heroine is likable and down-to-earth.  The hero is stuck in an unenviable position of fulfilling both his grandfather's wishes, whether he wants to or not.  The grandfathers are easily distinguishable from one another, with personalities of their own.  The villain is so awful, vain, and self-centered that it is a pleasure to watch her in action.  And the sidekick, Raphael Locke, is just as exciting and intriguing as the many scene-stealing sidekicks that JL has devoted full-blown novels to later on, like Angel (\\"Angel\\") and Vasili (\\"You Belong to Me\\").  I definitely want to read Rafe's sequel. <br /> <br />What I thought most interesting about \\"The Heir\\" was JL's new writing style (also present in \\"Home for the Holidays\\"), where she is now beginning to delve more into the psyches' of the characters.  Instead of her characters running about exacting revenge or whatever, they are now thinking things through - over-analyzing them, as Sabrina mentioned a couple times.  JL spent a lot of timeon their inner thought processes.  I think this was what \\"bored\\" other reviewers. <br /> <br />That said, \\"The Heir\\" does suffer from some problems.  For instance, the ransom situation was a weak plotline, adding nothing to the story.  I suspect JL thought she needed to throw in a punch-out scene for Duncan to give him more of her \\"Hero\\" qualities, since Ophelia's manipulations and his penchant for drinking away his misery could make him look weak to some people.  I also felt that the passion between the two lovers, once they finally came together, was rather subdued (or more likely, was overwhelmed by the whole Ophelia-will-be-compromised situation).  It WAS Sabrina who was compromised, and why this never became a significant plot point was beyond me.  There are some other problems with the story, but not important enough to discourage people from reading it. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"The Heir\\" is a pleasant read.  I would never classify it as her worst (having read or reread all her books these past 3 months, I can honestly say \\"Captive Bride\\" and \\"Paradise Wild\\" are the worst EVER), nor would I say it ranked among her best work.  But I thought it was different, charming, and more realistic than many of her other romances, much better than \\"Keeper of the Heart\\" or \\"Joining,\\" to name a few I rated as 3 stars, but not as good as \\"Until Forever\\" or \\"Love Only Once,\\" which I rated as 4 stars as well. <br />	2004-09-17

It's not JL's worst romance (\\"Captive Bride\\" and \\"Paradise Wild\\" tie for most awful ever), but \\"Home\\" severely lacks in the passion and character departments.  Neither Vincent nor Larissa have interesting or compelling personalities.  All we really know about them is Vincent has no feelings and Larissa is so innocent and compassionate she spends most of the book crying.  Worse, Larissa is a spineless boor of a heroine; she has no interesting dialogue, no background whatsoever to speak of, and no real reason to fall in love with Vincent.  She doesn't even really get mad, when her situation begs for a spirited tantrum or two.  As for Vincent, he had potential to be interesting, but the brevity of this novel (it's a novella, really) and JL's awful tell-don't-show narration kept him from blossoming into a full-blown hero.  Unfortunately, the only reasons he falls for her are 1) she's gorgeous and 2) he's lonely.  Shallow in the extreme.  I'd advise skipping \\"Home for the Holidays\\" and settling down with a marvelous JL romance instead.  Those who enjoy westerns should read \\"Savage Thunder\\"; for medieval, read \\"Defy Not the Heart\\"; for sci-fi romance, read \\"Warrior's Woman\\"; for Regency, begin the Malory Family series with \\"Love Only Once\\"; for a good rags-to-riches JL, read \\"Once A Princess;\\" or for something a little shocking, try \\"Secret Fire\\" (risqu) or \\"Prisoner of My Desire\\" (a true jaw-dropper).	2004-09-13

I read \\"A Loving Scoundrel\\" in about 5 hours; couldn't put in down, really.  Yes, it was predictable.  Yes, the girl is always beautiful and ends up being really obnoxiously rich.  Yes, the danger never really seems threatening.  But it still was a bloody good read.  I think I like Danny the best of all the Malory novel heroines (even better than Georgina, who is such a feisty girl).  First, Danny is a street urchin, a thief who talks like gutter trash and keeps a mouse as a pet.  This is no pampered princess here.  Danny actually works hard to survive; plus, she has goals that very few romance novel heroines ever have.  Where most heroines just go about the book wanting to marry and live happily ever after, Danny wants to marry AND help other orphans by running an orphanage.  I found this to be sweet and commendable, as well as most happily un-heroine like.  Danny is also blunt, which is nice, since she becomes quite the challenge for young scamp Jeremy, who has gads of girls falling all over themselves trying to get his notice.  Having read about Jeremy for at least the last 15 years, I feel like I've grown up with him, and so it was fun to see him, near my own age, in his own story and struggling with romance.  I loved how Danny denied him ... that boy was never denied anything before!  Speaking of denying, there are a few reviews distastefully likening Danny and Jeremy's first night together as date rape.  If you read more carefully, you would have noticed how much Danny was dying to have him since the moment they first met; on the night in question, yes, she was tipsy, but she had also made up her mind (was \\"tired of fighting it\\") to be with Jeremy (\\"Was he afraid she'd stop him?  Not a chance, when she had such an amazing urge to feel his naked body against hers\\").  That is quite MORE than willing, thank you very much.  Anyway, as Malory novels go, this one was fun, especially since it revolved around servants rather than aristocrats.  Thankfully, this one also had the least amount of back-story and Malory family reunions (sacrilegious, I know) than the past few novels in the series, which was refreshing, really, since it allowed us to concentrate on the lovers and not family shenanigans.  Some people may also harp on how unrealistic maid-turned-lady may be (dare we suggest they read \\"Pygmalion\\"?), but it worked for me.  All in all, I enjoyed \\"A Loving Scoundrel,\\" but would suggest reading it after you read the 6 other Malory novels that proceed it (starting with \\"Love Only Once\\"), just to find out why we Malory fans LOVE Jeremy and to know all the history of the unforgettable Malory family. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-07

However, I think it's safe to say only someone who has read all the Malory novels will appreciate (and be able to follow) the MANY characters present at Haverston for Christmas.  I'm also glad \\"The Present\\" tied up loose ends with Jason and Molly, as their situation seemed so sad in \\"say You Love Me.\\"   <br /> <br />That said, this being a short book, with so many different characters, I think that the romance between the actual hero and heroine of this book - namely, Lord Christopher and the Gypsy Anastasia - was definitely short-changed.  Christopher pretty much lusted after Anastasia, while Anastasia had only one day to pick an Englishman to marry to save herself from a brutal Gypsy bridegroom. This is hardly romantic, especially since Christopher was so drunk he didn't even remember marrying her.  In fact, their love (or lust) affair flies by so quick you might miss it if you blink.  Their bizarre courtship could be forgiven if it were drawn out and filled in with seriously steamy love scenes, as JL has done many times before in other books.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Something else I noticed about \\"The Present\\" were some questionable items in the family trees.  Can anyone explain why Warren Anderson's children have Malory last names, why George's twins aren't even listed on the Anderson Family tree, and why it is written that Warren and Amy have an older son named Eric, yet only the twins were mentioned in the story?  Very odd.   <br /> <br />Anyway, \\"The Present\\" is a light, fast read (two hours for me) that most likely would appeal to Malory fans; anyone who has never read a Malory novel would be better off starting with #1 \\"Love Only Once\\" and working your way through some AWESOME Malory novels (\\"Tender Rebel,\\" \\"Gentle Rogue\\") before you get to #6 \\"The Present.\\"	2004-09-05

I love the Malory novels, especially \\"Tender Rebel\\" and \\"Gentle Rogue.\\"  That said, I thought that the fifth Malory novel, \\"Say You Love Me,\\" while a quick read, was rather lackluster.  I am actually surprised so many reviewers gave it 4 or 5 stars; it makes we wonder if we were even reading the same book, or if they were letting their love for the Malorys cloud their judgment.    In fact, I recall trying to read \\"Say\\" when it first came out in 1996.  I think I read two chapters before giving up (and I LOVE Lindsey).  Now, here I am, in 2004; knowing Jeremy finally has his own story, I decided to reread the entire Malory series before buying \\"A Loving Scoundrel.\\" So that meant I actually had to finish \\"Say.\\"  Well, I did.  Needless to say, I was not impressed.      \\"Say\\" revolves around Derek Malory, the illegitimate son of a Marquis, and a young rakehell, to boot.  In a rather selfless act of compassion, he \\"saves\\" Kelsey Langton - a Lady in need of money to save her family from financial ruin - by buying her in a public auction at a brothel as his mistress.  He deliberately outbids a sadistic lord intent on purchasing her for his own cruel sexual deviations.    An interesting start to a Malory novel.  But, instead of being the usual light-hearted, witty romantic runaround that involves a lot of seduction and sensual banter (which define Malory novels), \\"Say\\" goes a different route.  Derek doesn't have to seduce Kelsey - he's bought her, so she must comply.  The banter is limited in this novel, probably because Kelsey is so accommodating and because the uncle that this Malory novel highlights is Jason, the dead-serious one.  Worse, the novel has the darkest, most awful \\"bad guy\\" scene of any JL romance: Kelsey is kidnapped and taken to a house of horrors by the sadist, who intends to rape and torture her.   This is THE most disturbing thing JL has written; in my mind, it belonged in a suspense thriller or horror story, not a romance novel.  However, to top it off, this scene occurs in the middle of the novel; after Kelsey is rescued, JL spends about two sentences saying \\"Oh yeah, it was a pretty awful experience, so she spent a week in bed,\\" before promptly forgetting about it.  This is the type of incident that traumatizes people for life.  Hello!    I also noticed that there was too much back-story to this book.  Having read Malory books #1 through 4 in the last few weeks, back-to-back, I didn't appreciate the summarizations very much.  I think it would have been a lot more fun if JL had written more about what Regina, Anthony, James, Warren, etc. have been up to now, rather than what had happened in novels I can reread anytime.    Finally, three other points: 1) The last half of the book revolves around why it would be scandalous if Kelsey and Derek marry (even James and Anthony, those scandalmongers, were naysaying a wedding); please, these are the Malorys - they relish scandal - so this plotline, knowing the family, seemed ridiculous. 2) What was the point to Kelsey having The Tragedy in her life?  JL teased us readers with it, made it seem important, then let it flatline completely.  So sad.  3) I actually finished the novel thinking it was still embarrasing for Kelsey to show her face among the Malorys, since everyone was so dead-set against her and the solution was so silly.     FYI: The Malory series includes 1) \\"Love Only Once\\" (Regina is compromised by bored rake Nicholas), 2) \\"Tender Rebel\\" (Roslynn must marry, and Anthony offers himself as groom), 3) \\"Gentle Rogue\\" (Georgina ends up as James' cabin boy aboard his ship), 4) \\"Magic of You\\" (Amy will make Warren marry her no matter what), 5) \\"Say You Love Me\\" (Derek buys Kelsey in an auction), 6) \\"The Present\\" (novella about the gypsy great-grandmother), and 7) \\"A Loving Scoundrel\\" (Jeremy lets a thief steal his heart).	2004-09-04

I read the \\"The Magic of You\\" in two days, it was so delightful.  The fourth book in the Malory series, \\"Magic\\" revolves around 18-year old Amy Malory pursuing - and seducing - her unwilling groom-to-be, hotheaded, coldhearted Warren Anderson.  Amy is definitely a Malory: she's bold, witty, and determined to get what she wants, even if the object of her affection absolutely refuses to fall for her (didn't those rakes, Anthony and James, as well as impish Regina, have the same problem?).  Warren is an explosive man who is nursing a bitter resentment against marriage and the woman who played him false, forcing Amy to try anything and everything to melt his heart.  It's hysterical to see how far she goes.     I enjoyed reading \\"Magic\\"; it had great Malory banter and brilliant family scenes, such as the whole family's reaction as Warren's sister Georgina gives birth.  There were, however, a couple reasons I gave this book a 4 instead of 5.  For one, a few of the Malorys I'd have liked to seen more of, like Regina, Nick, and Roslynn, barely made appearances.  Of course, this is not a serious complaint, since this isn't their book, and I can read \\"Love Only Once\\" or \\"Tender Rebel\\" ay time I want to satisfy that desire.  A real complaint, though, was the whole kidnapping thing.  It really didn't add much to the story other than to get Amy and Warren in bed together (which occurs, finally, more than 300 pages into the book).  The threat to their lives was an afterthought in relation to their rocky courtship.  In addition, I thought referring to the Chinese as \\"Oriental\\" was rude, especially since the book was published in 1993 (and, honestly, I don't care if people actually said that word in the 1800s, because I can point out the English and American jargon, etc. used in this book aren't exactly accurate either).  I also didn't like Taishi's silly broken English, which while I'm sure many people thought amusing, I thought in poor taste.  Anyway, I hate to sound so PC, but that did bug me as I read it.      So that's my assessment of \\"The Magic of You,\\" a vastly entertaining novel (with a few flaws) about two extremely stubborn people caught in the pursuit of love.  To better enjoy this novel, I'd recommend reading the 3 that came before it (\\"Love Only Once,\\" \\"Tender Rebel,\\" and \\"Gentle Rogue\\") to really appreciate the characters and back-story.	2004-09-03

It actually begins with a few scenes taken word-for-word from \\"Tender Rebel,\\" though fleshes them out with Georgina's story, explaining why James meets her for the first time in a tavern, disguised as a boy.  Georgina keeps the ruse aboard James' ship as it sails from England to Jamaica, where she works as a cabin boy.  This is when the fun really begins!  Georgina trying her hardest to remember she is a boy is hysterical, especially since she doesn't know that James knows she's a girl.  I love the banter between these two, as well as the burning passion.  Then we're introduced to Georgina's five protective older brothers, who hate all things English - including James.  Not only do they add hilarity and action to the story, but Lindsey also sets up the fourth Malory novel, \\"The Magic of You,\\" featuring coldhearted, hot-tempered Warren, the brother determined to see that pirate James hang.  Overall, \\"Gentle Rogue\\" is an exciting, endearing story with lots of wit, unforgettable characters, and plenty of memorable scenes.  It's a definite must-read!	2004-09-01

A \\"connoisseur of women,\\" Anthony is a gorgeous, wonderfully charming rake who spends the entire book trying to win the heroine's love (which he doesn't realize he has).  He is one of those characters you could imagine as real: an (extraordinarily handsome) regular guy with wicked wit, a penchant for the gym, and lots of buddies to get drunk and have fun with.  He's not a knight scaling castle walls.  He's not a prince or swashbuckling pirate.  He's not even out for revenge.  He's actually the kind of guy you could run into on the street...which makes you oh-so wistful, wanting him for your very own.     Anthony first appeared as Regina's adorably angry rakehell uncle in \\"Love Only Once,\\" stealing the show in the first of the fantastic Malory Family series.  \\"Tender Rebel\\" is the second of seven books (as of 2004).  I love \\"Tender Rebel,\\" which is bursting with wit, passion, and lovable characters.  Both Anthony and Roslynn are made for each other - the \\"confirmed bachelor\\" and Scottish beauty have eyes for no one else.  Yet Roslynn, terrified of Anthony's scandalous reputation, refuses to fall in love with him.  Too bad for Anthony, who must struggle to win her over.    Roslynn has other problems besides having the most desirable man in London lusting after her.  The strong-willed heiress must get herself married NOW before her fortune-hunting cousin forces her into matrimony.  She agrees to let Anthony advise her on who to marry.  Big mistake, since he wants her for himself.    Add to the mix Anthony's many family members (especially retired pirate James and his rowdy son Jeremy), a quaint Scottish brogue, and a rather sensual use for a chair, and you have a delightful tale of love and marriage in \\"Tender Rebel.\\"      Plus, as an added bonus, \\"Tender Rebel\\" sets-up James' high-seas romance in \\"Gentle Rogue,\\" the third in the Malory Family series.    All in all, \\"Tender Rebel\\" is a most wonderful read.  Just remember to read \\"Love Only Once\\" first, so you get to meet Anthony before you read about his seductive romance in \\"Tender Rebel.\\"	2004-08-21

The lark was kidnapping his current mistress in public and then locking her up in his home so that she misses an important ball.  The mistake is that he nabbed the wrong woman! <br /> <br />Too late to save her reputation, the lovely and charming Regina Ashton decides she must marry Nicholas - before her uncles kill him - and there is where the real trouble begins. <br /> <br />This book is fast-paced and witty.  Nicky is a different JL hero - a conceited rake bored out of his mind.  Plus he has a dark secret hanging over his head.  Regina is simply a delight!  She had impish humor and a delightful ability to wrap her four doting uncles around her little finger. <br /> <br />As for the uncles ... this is where we meet them all, especially Anthony and James.  Yummy!  Anthony, a rake himself, wants to shoot Nicky dead.  James punches him out instead. <br /> <br />I enjoyed reading \\"Love Only Once,\\" especially any scene involving Anthony or James and Jeremy (James' son).  In fact, I loved it so much, I read it in only a few hours.  The book starts off with a bang, introducing us to the fun cast of characters and the kidnapping incident ... but tapers off after Nicky is coerced into taking Regina as his bride.  The reason I gave this book 4 stars is that Nicky strives hard to be a jerk and succeeds very well ... too well, since I started disliking him even though I understood why he was doing it.  I also found it hard to believe that Regina took his boorish behavior so well, considering she IS a Malory.  Oh well.  I still enjoyed this book immensely, but probably because Anthony and James stole the show. <br /> <br />There are several books in the Malory series.  My absolute favorites, of course,are \\"Tender Rebel\\" (about Anthony) and \\"Gentle Rogue\\" (about James). <br /> <br />	2004-08-19

The third in a series beginning with \\"Man of My Dreams,\\" \\"The Pursuit\\" follows the exploits of 16 uncles determined to keep their niece from marrying a man with a \\"crazy\\" past.  Note that the story is more about the uncles than the romance! <br /> <br />Lincoln is the man with a past, a Scot raised in England who is now seeking a wife.  He spies Melissa in Scotland, talks with her briefly, lets her dimples wreck havoc on his system, and then decides to marry her.  Unfortunately, she's leaving the next day for her season in London.  Plus, she has the 16 uncles who, having had a rather nasty experience with Lincoln when he was 10 years old, go to great lengths to keep the two apart. <br /> <br />Most of the book revolves around Lincoln facing off against the scheming uncles and then proving he's not crazy.  In between, Melissa and Lincoln see each other about three or four times - briefly - in the span of about two months, kiss only twice, and somehow (though I'm not sure why) fall madly in love.   <br /> <br />I did like Melissa's and Lincoln's characters.  Melissa is adorable with her Scottish burr and impish wit, and most amusing in her anger towards her interfering uncles.  Lincoln is honorable and has a lot of pent-up resentment towards his mother, who abandoned him as a child.  Alas, together, Melissa and Lincoln lacked that spark that makes a Johanna Lindsey romance so great to read.  They acted more like kids with a crush than the hero and heroine of a romance novel. <br /> <br />I could have accepted the story being mostly about the uncles, amusing hotheaded savages that they are.  I could have also accepted the overblown crush between Melissa and Lincoln as being the basis for a romance novel.  But I could NOT appreciate some of the dopey plotlines in this book.  Worst was the plot involving Melissa and the dragon in the lake.  Here was a scene that could have been played out into something intense and meaningful; instead, it was treated almost comically.  Too bad.  I also did not like the fact the uncles and Lincoln were obsessed over something that happened when Lincoln was 10.  Even Lindsey, in her writing, seemed to be getting annoyed with dwelling on it, if you pay attention to her character's responses over it.  Finally, the situation with Lincoln's mom is way too dramatic.  What, exactly, did it lend to the story, other than to give Lincoln a simple excuse to forgive her?   <br /> <br />All in all, this was a strange read for a romance novel.  \\"The Pursuit\\" is full of lame coincidences (Lincoln, for instance, gets out of being shanghaied to China rather easily) and ridiculous storylines, with very little passion to hold it together.  The only real pleasure I got was in reading about the uncles.  I hope Ian Six gets a book (with passion) of his own.  The same goes for Justin St. James - what a hottie! <br /> <br />My advice is to avoid \\"The Pursuit\\" (especially its endless back story) and instead read its prequels, \\"Man of My Dreams\\" (5 stars) or \\"Love Me Forever\\" (3 stars).  Or, if you'd like a great Scottish romance, read Lindsey's immensely satisfying \\"A Gentle Feuding.\\"   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-17

It revolves around two people in search of someone to marry now: Lachlan is a penniless Scottish lord in need of a rich wife, and Kimberly is an English heiress whose betrothal has been broken and is forced by her father to find a husband.  Both end up at Sherring Cross, the home of Megan & Devlin of \\"Man of My Dreams.\\"  As a sequel, \\"Love Me Forever\\" incorporates its prequel characters (Megan & Devlin) so thoroughly that half the book is devoted to scenes between the two.  Which leaves little room for Lachlan and Kimberly's story to develop fully.  Lachlan and Kimberly are likable enough characters (he's good-humored and charming, she's quickly flustered yet spirited), but their romance lags, especially in the beginning of the book, and doesn't pick up until Lachlan is accused of stealing Devlin's prized thoroughbreds.  This is an interesting plot line simply because JL never threatened any of her heroes with prison before.  The romance perks up then, but the book becomes unnecessarily long with a few chapters devoted to Kimberly's genealogy.  Again, it was an alright book, but it lacked in the pure wit and passion found in its prequel, \\"Man of My Dreams.\\"  Sure, \\"Love Me Forever\\" had some interesting moments - like when Kimberly first meets Lachlan, and her nose is running terribly from a cold - but there are too many blah things about this book (for instance, why so many ridiculous coincidences?).  I much prefer \\"Man of My Dreams\\" (5 stars) over \\"Love Me Forever,\\" and I definitely DON'T recommend \\"Love Me Forever's\\" sequel, the exceptionally lame \\"Pursuit,\\" which is about Lachlan and Kimberly's daughter, Melissa.    PS. Did anyone catch what the huge favor was that Devlin owed Kimberly's dad to make the Duke sponsor her?  I must have missed that completely.	2004-08-08

The first of three novels set in England and Scotland around the 1900s, \\"Man\\" is the story of beautiful redhead Megan, a squire's daughter with high ambitions, and the duke-in-disguise who she falls for when she thinks him a lowly horse breeder. <br />  <br /> Megan and Devlin have serious chemistry together. From the moment they meet, they can't take their eyes off each other. Their repartee is just as steamy - it seems all they talk about is the various pleasures they so desperately want to give each other. <br />  <br /> I love their clash of wills and the crazy ride through Scotland, where we meet the reaver Lachlan (who has his own story in \\"Love Me Forever\\"). The story does slow down a bit towards the end - I, too, felt just like Megan when she complained she wanted her lusty, insulting \\"horse breeder\\" back in place of the stuffy Duke that Devlin becomes.  <br />  <br /> All in all, \\"Man of My Dreams\\" is a wild romp in the hay. Devlin is a great male lead with a life of his own, Megan adorable with her conversations with herself, and the storyline focused and satisfying. Plus, it sizzles with passion.  <br />  <br /> FYI: It has two sequels: &quot;Love Me Forever&quot; and &quot;The Pursuit.&quot; <br />	2004-08-05

I finally decided it was \\"alright\\" approaching \\"lackluster,\\" especially in comparison to its marvelous prequel, \\"Defy Not the Heart.\\" <br /> <br />A medieval romance, \\"Joining\\" is the story of tomboy Milisant and the knight Wulfric, betrothed since babies, who hate each other but are to be married in a month.  With the ability to befriend any and all animals, Milisant desperately wishes she were a boy, and dresses that way.  She loves to hunt with her bow and run around with dirt on her face.  Wulfric is dark and brooding, and has a penchant for ordering Milisant around.  At first, he prefers Milisant's most ladylike twin sister, Jhone, yet somehow he ends up falling for his uncouth bride-to-be. <br /> <br />I loved the relationship between Jhone and Milisant.  In fact, I think this novel would have withered and died without it.  There's real devotion between the two sisters; plus, wise Jhone gives excellent, witty advice to her wayward sister.  Actually, I think I liked Jhone better than Milisant, which is sad.  You're supposed to like the heroine.  But Milisant as a heroine is an eyeball-rolling experience.  She reminds me of a drama queen twelve-year old. <br /> <br />It's hard to feel much for Wulfric.  He doesn't get too much story time, as most of \\"Joining\\" revolves around conversations between Milisant and Jhone. <br /> <br />The hatred between the two lovers-to-be is based on an experience that occurred when they were kids.  It's an argument gone bad, with a dead bird and broken ankle thrown in.  Most of it is just dopey.  More hard feelings revolve around a distracting subplot with famous King John and a visit to the home of Reina & Ranulf of \\"Defy Not the Heart.\\"  I wish I could say Reina & Ranulf were fun to see again; unfortunately, they were so little used it's silly to call \\"Joining\\" a sequel. <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Joining\\" is fine isyou've never read a Johanna Lindsey novel.  It has its moments, with witty dialogue here and there and some interesting situations, but it's not great.  It's way too women's lib (in the medieval times?!?) for me to stomach and lacks real passion (they don't even get it on until page 320).   <br /> <br />I personally would prefer to read \\"Defy Not the Heart.\\" <br /> <br />	2004-08-03

I'm amazed that there are reviewers who disliked Sheena because of her estranged relationship with her sisters or because of her so-called vanity.

I cannot even begin to say how great it was, starting at page one. This book was fast-paced, witty, well written, and had some unbelievably unforgettable characters.  <br />  <br /> Set in medieval times, &quot;Defy&quot; is a story about the mercenary knight Ranulf, who kidnaps Lady Reina to force her to wed a greedy lord, only to be convinced by Reina to marry her himself. <br />  <br /> Reina is an awesome heroine. Nicknamed the &quot;Little General&quot; by her new husband, she has a sharp wit, fiery temper, and a penchant for calling her loved ones &quot;lackwits.&quot; She even goes to war against a cat. <br />  <br /> Ranulf is her gorgeous equal -- part grouch, part giant, with a sad past and the body of a god. I love the fact that he spends most of the book trying to figure out how to pleasure his wife in bed, an area where he was most disappointing at first. <br />  <br /> This book is unique among Lindsey's work. She is careful with the narration, using a &quot;medieval&quot; writing style. There are some serious laugh-aloud scenes in this book, mostly because of the cat and Reina's gay chambermaid. And, the story revolves around the two characters getting to know each other after having been thrust into a quite-unexpected marriage (rather than revolving around a bad guy or some other distracting plot line). Altogether, it's a refreshing change! <br />  <br /> I heartily recommend this book. It is Johanna Lindsey at her best! Though, please note, it does have a sequel in the recently published &quot;Joining,&quot; which is like a deflated balloon compared to the amazing zeppelin of a romance that is &quot;Defy Not the Heart.&quot; <br />	2004-07-28

It shouldn't even qualify as a romance, it is so awful and boring.<br />The plot of &quot;Paradise&quot; revolves around two characters plotting revenge. Jared hates Corrinne's father and marries her as part of a plan to ruin her family financially. But Corrinne is so humiliated that she tracks Jared down to Hawaii to get her own revenge by ruining his reputation.<br />Both Corrinne and Jared are despicable as the heroine and hero. Corrinne is angry, unreasonable, catty, and money-hungry. She does have an interesting vice - she's a gambling addict - but even that bad habit (and its interesting results when she runs out of money) cannot make her sympathetic. She's just lame - and, in my opinion, gets what she deserves. Jared is also blah. After we are treated to a detailed love scene with his mistress (sure way to make the hero unlikable), we get to hear all the boring details of his business and his plans to ruin Corrinne's father through poor investments. After spiting and mistreating each other CONSTANTLY, these two somehow fall in love, though I'm not sure why. Jared refers to Corrinne's beauty enough times that I'm pretty sure it was her looks he loves, not her personality. Pretty shallow, all in all.<br />The only thing remotely interesting about &quot;Paradise Wild&quot; are the descriptions of Oahu, Hawaii. However, I've been to Oahu several times and had no problem following the tidbits Lindsey dropped about location, foods, and language. I'm not sure if a reader who has never been to Oahu would appreciate these details fully.<br />Over all, this book sucked. The plot was listless, the characters terrible, the romance nil. Even the writing was stiff as a board. &quot;Paradise&quot; is on par with &quot;Captive Bride&quot; and &quot;A Pirate's Love&quot; as seriously terrible Lindsey romances, though &quot;Paradise&quot; is the worst of the lot. I wouldn't waste time with it. <br />If you want toread a wonderful Lindsey romance, try &quot;Savage Thunder,&quot; &quot;A Heart So Wild,&quot; &quot;Once a Princess,&quot; or &quot;Hearts Aflame.&quot; These are REAL romances.	2004-07-19

Both have big secrets. <br />I really enjoyed this book and its personable characters. The heroine, Sharisse, has NO idea what it's like to rough it in the desert as she's accustomed to maids doing everything for her, including removing her clothes. It's hysterical to see her attempt to cook. As for the Holt brothers - yummy. Identical twins, one is charming and easy going, the other an ominous gunslinger. It's fascinating to realize that Sharisse wants them both!<br />The plot is straightforward, though there are twists aplenty. I read it in one day, and realized it was just as good now as it was the first time I read it more than 10 years ago. <br />FYI: Other great Westerns romances by Johanna Lindsey include &quot;A Heart So Wild&quot; and &quot;Heart of Thunder,&quot; as well as the marvelous &quot;Savage Thunder.&quot;	2004-07-15

The third in a trilogy, \\"Surrender My Love\\" lacks in the romance department. The story is about a Viking exacting vengeance on his beautiful Danish tormenter - oh yeah, and then they fall in love in the last 50 or so pages.<br /><br />I have nothing against Selig, the angel-faced Viking hero. I loved him as the twice-blessed baby in \\"Fires of Winter\\" and as Kristen's returned-from-the-dead brother in \\"Hearts Aflame.\\" He is so charming! But in \\"Surrender My Love,\\" Selig doesn't get much opportunity to use that charm. Instead, he's wounded and beaten so badly in the beginning of the book that the whole story revolves around his pain, slow recovery, and revenge. I for one wished Selig hadn't suffered yet another wound, as his previous injuries in \\"Hearts Aflame\\" were bad enough. But Johanna Lindsey felt the need to hurt poor Selig once more - and screw up his much-anticipated love story in the process. Why?!?<br /><br />Selig is paired up with Erika, a Danish Viking maid - and the girl who had him lashed. So, in Viking tradition, he takes her prisoner (only to fall in love). But, unlike the stories involving his mother and sister, Erika is no spirited vixen of a captive. She's not even witty. She accepts her chains and humiliation without a peep. Again, why does Selig fall in love?!?<br /><br />I can't say this story was terrible. After all, lots of characters from the earlier books returned, so it was a fun family reunion. But, it was bogged down with back-story. Secondary characters like King Alfred and Meghan, who were so alive in the previous books, were carbon cutouts in \\"Surrender.\\" New characters, like Turgeis the Shadow, were actually intriguing, but so little used, it was sad. Worse, there was no passion or hanky panky until about page 330 - the last 80 or so pages of a 400+ page book. And, on top of that, WHY were Kristen and Brenna - both ex-slaves - so cavalier about Erika's enslavement?<br /><br />I'd much rather read \\"Fires of Winter\\" and \\"Hearts Aflame,\\"the first two of the trilogy, then bother with \\"Surrender My Love.\\" Maybe we'll be lucky and Johanna will redeem herself by writing Meghan's story, putting in a good dose of charming Selig and not wounded and vengeful Selig, which is all \\"Surrender\\" seems to be about.	2004-07-15

A story about a Saxon lord and his Viking prisoner, \\"Hearts\\" sizzles with passion, wit, and MANY unforgettable scenes (a whipping, naked run-ins with the King, hundreds of armed Vikings to the rescue...). Kristen is the boldest, most open character JL has ever written; the Viking maid knows what she wants, and sets out to get it. And what she wants is Royce, an utterly delicious man who hates Vikings with a vengeance. He may hate her people, but there's no way he can resist such a saucy, sassy, spirited \\"slave\\" who gives as good as she gets, even in chains. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel - it has a sexy couple, passionate encounters, believable storyline, and lots of secondary characters who charm you immensely (especially Selig, who was such a precious baby in \\"Fires of Winter,\\" but now such a hunk of a Viking in \\"Hearts Aflame\\"). Yes, \\"Hearts Aflame\\" is the second book in a trilogy, though it easily stands alone (and does so, with barely any back story). It is also THE BEST in the trilogy, which includes \\"Fires of Winter\\" and \\"Surrender My Love.\\" I highly recommend \\"Hearts Aflame,\\" but I suggest you read its prequel first, just to enjoy its secondary characters all the more.	2004-07-12

It's almost hard to find the romance buried beneath these intense subjects, but Lindsey does it - and makes you want to read more.<br />Brenna and Garrick are exciting together, with Brenna's iron will clashing against Garrick's cold heart. She absolutely refuses to be his slave. He absolutely refuses to admit he wants, needs, and (eventually) loves her. All they do is fight, fight, fight, but it's fun to watch. There are also other characters in this story who you end up caring for: Perrin and his slave love Janie, kind Erin from the stable, jealous Cordella, brave Dog, and so on.<br />That said, I have a couple issues with this book. It's easy to tell it's one of Lindsey's earliest novels, for the writing is stiff, the characters lacking Lindsey's famous humor and wit, and some of the dialogue quite cheesy (the first chapter alone is a sad cliche of girl trying hard to be boy). Also, some situations could have used a little more detail, such as Garrick's torture at the hands of the Celts and his sister's death (both are critical to the plot). <br />All in all, however, I enjoyed &quot;Fires of Winter,&quot; finding it an engaging read (the details of Viking life alone are fascinating). Better yet, it is the first in Lindsey's Viking series, which also includes &quot;Hearts Aflame&quot; (the best!!!) and &quot;Surrender My Love.&quot; Read this book, if not for the story itself, but for the fact that its sequel &quot;Hearts&quot; is amazing, and would be a more enjoyable read by knowing what happens in &quot;Fires of Winter.&quot;	2004-07-12

In fact, \\"Keeper\\" in no way compares to its prequel, the outstanding and wonderful \\"Warrior's Woman,\\" yet it is a far cry from the stupidity of its boring sequel, \\"Heart of a Warrior.\\"    \\"Keeper\\" is a decent story, with bits of passion and humor here and there. The gist of the story is that Shanelle's fear of marrying a warrior and her low tolerance of pain make her resist and flee from Falon, forcing her chosen lifemate to chase her across the galaxy to prove his love.    First, the positives. Lindsey did an excellent job of incorporating the characters from \\"Warrior's Woman\\" into \\"Keeper\\" with little to no back-story and stayed true to their personalities and speech patterns. I read the three books back-to-back, and was pleased at how naturally \\"Warrior's\\" story flowed into \\"Keeper.\\"    Now, the negatives: Shanelle's fear of pain and punishment were ridiculously overblown. It was difficult to sympathize with her. If she could learn to defend herself with martial arts, etc., she should be able to tolerate some pain. But the entire book was about her dopey fears! I found myself rolling my eyes once or twice while reading. Worse yet, with Tedra as her mother, how could she be such a wus?!?    I also thought the men in \\"Keeper\\" - Challen, Dalden, and Falon (wow, that rhymes!) - were ALL a bit heavy-handed where Shanelle was concerned. I'd be pretty upset if I had three overbearing warriors breathing down my neck over my love life. Yeah, I'd leave the planet, too.     As for the spanking scene, I started rolling my eyes (again) over the reviews freaking out about it. I'm sorry, but if that really offended you, you should not be reading a Johanna Lindsey romance. A lot worse happens to other heroines in her other books, many of which are awesome novels. This was NOTHING.    ***For those interested in other sci-fi romances, try \\"Lord of the Storm\\" and its sequel \\"The Skyprirate\\" by Justine Davis.  Both are out of print, but worth reading.

I have an English Literature degree and enjoy all genres, so I couldn't begin to describe how delighted I was with \\"Warrior's Woman,\\" a cross between romance and science fiction. And what an amazing book it was! To cram 300+ pages into one sentence, it is the story of a gorgeous security guard who must flee her planet after a coup d'etat and ends up the \\"challenge loser\\" to a hunk of a \\"barbarian\\" warrior on an undiscovered planet. First and foremost, Tedra is an awesome heroine: spirited, witty, and extremely strong, independent, and lethal. She and Challen are hot together, and it is most fun to watch her frustration at Challen's unusual warrior culture and customs. Challen himself is a different kind of Lindsey hero: of course, he's a babe, but his speech patterns, supreme confidence, and complete focus on Tedra and Tedra alone (with no other plotlines to distract him) make him unique. I love their intimate moments - and there are MANY - and the humorous \\"interventions\\" by Tedra's AI computer, Martha, who is a charm. \\"Warrior's Woman\\" is one of Lindsey's most fascinating books, with great care and detail given to the futuristic setting and a simply enthralling story of two people from completely different worlds (literally) who fall madly in love.     FYI: \\"Warrior's Woman\\" is the first in a three-book series involving these characters and their children. Hands down, this book is absolutely the best of all three. The second, \\"Keeper of the Heart,\\" is okay. The third, \\"Heart of a Warrior\\" is rather tepid.    ***For those interested in other sci-fi romances, try \\"Lord of the Storm\\" and its sequel \\"The Skyprirate\\" by Justine Davis.

The first book, \\"Warrior's Woman,\\" is a personal favorite.  The second, \\"Keeper of the Heart,\\" is alright.  This third book - \\"Heart of a Warrior\\" - simply lacks in passion, plot, character, etc.    \\"Heart\\" is the story of a gorgeous \\"barbarian\\" who travels via spaceship to modern-day Earth to stop an evil alien king from committing bad deeds and ends up falling for a Californian carpenter named Brittany.  The story line is promising, but ...     Among my many complaints:    Back-story is the enemy, especially when there is too much of it.  \\"Heart\\" takes the cake in overdosing on back-story, mostly because it borrows heavily from its prequels in terms of evil villains and family relationships.    Also, there's lot of really dumb things that happen in this book.  One of the more irritating and unbelievable things is the fact that drop-dead gorgeous Brittany is still a virgin at almost 30 and single because she is (drum roll please) \\"too tall\\" for men.  Come on, she's 6 feet.  Whatever.  She also refuses to believe Dalden's an alien (albeit a gorgeous one) for SO long that it gets to be pretty lame.  If I spent 3 months on a spaceship and walked on the moon, like Brittany does, I'd be convinced my new boyfriend was from outer space.    Another problem I had with this book is the fact that it covers the same ground as \\"Until Forever,\\" an earlier Lindsey novel, in which a barbarian-like hero also tries to adjust to modern-day technology, like the car, etc.  It was fun in \\"Until Forever,\\" but pretty boring in \\"Heart of a Warrior.\\"  Worse were the hints that Tedra's Ancients from Kystran were similar to Earthlings - Lindsey never elaborates, which was frustrating.      My only enjoyment came in reading about Tedra again, who shined in \\"Warrior's Woman.\\"  I love that story, and recommend it over the lackluster \\"Heart of a Warrior\\" any day.    ***For those interested in other sci-fi romances, try \\"Lord of the Storm\\" and its sequel \\"The Skyprirate\\" by Justine Davis.

The writing is explosive, filled to the brim with memorable scenes and outstanding characters.<br />It's the story of Russian Prince Dimitri, who sees English aristocrat Katherine on the street in disguise as a maid and decides to have her for the night. His personal manservant Vladimir won't let her refuse, and kidnaps her. From that point on, &quot;Secret Fire&quot; is a breathless romp between two stubborn, passionate people aching to be with one another.<br />The love scenes alone are original. Yes, she's drugged - but not by Dimitri (at first). However, I've never read anything sexier than what happens when these two are together. Later, Katherine's imperial temper and scathing wit collide with Dimitri's tyrant of an aunt, which results in an absolutely shocking punishment, followed by one of the coolest rescue scenes ever (in a kitchen, no less).<br />I love this story. Dimitri and his &quot;Katya&quot; are hot together, and their story is wickedly delightful and totally unforgettable. The only true criticism I have is that Lindsey spends one or two chapters solely discussing Russia and Russian history, which was not as interesting as Dimitri and Katherine's love lives. If you are a history or culture buff, this won't bother you; if you just want to see the two get it on, it won't hurt you to skip these passages.<br />&quot;Secret Fire&quot; is one of Lindsey's more risque and fascinating stories. I highly recommend it!!!!	2004-07-07

The plot is straightforward: Lord Rolfe decides to marry his reluctant neighbor Leonie to secure peace in his lands and ends up falling in love. Both characters jump of the page as totally real and likable, and the situations they find themselves aren't unrealistic. I especially liked the drama created by Rolfe's ex-mistress Amelia, who is the numero uno \\"bad guy\\" in this story. More importantly, the ending is satisfying (everyone gets theirs) and there is one especially delightful scene in which Leonie and Rolfe pit army versus army over ... jealousy. What fun!      This is definitely one of Lindsey's better medieval romances. The only complaint I can make is that the hero's ex-mistress in \\"So Speaks the Heart,\\" which is an earlier Lindsey medieval romance, is also named Amelia. Are they related?!? Hah.       All in all, I highly recommend this book any day!	2004-07-04

In fact, it is worse than &quot;A Pirate's Love,&quot; which is pretty damn terrible, but at least &quot;Pirate&quot; is so terrible it's funny. &quot;Captive&quot; didn't even have a spark of wit, intentional or otherwise.<br />So what is wrong with &quot;Captive Bride&quot;?<br />1. For starters, it took me a week to read it. A week! In contrast, I read JL's superb &quot;When Love Awaits&quot; in 3 hours. I even read &quot;A Pirate's Love&quot; in 2 days, and I thought that was pushing it. But a week?!? The first few chapters of &quot;Captive&quot; are VERY boring. Most of it is spent on stupid dialogue like Christina asking the servants for a bath or in dumb topics like brushing her hair or getting dressed. Nothing of interest happens until Philip steals her in the middle of the night and drags her halfway across Egypt to be his love slave.<br />2. All the characters are wooden, with perhaps the exception of Tommy, who surprised me by screaming like a baby in the end. JL can't even keep her characterization straight. For instance: one second, Philip claims he won't marry, the next he's proposing the moment he meets Christina. Hmmmm. And WHY does Christina weep over the old sheik's death? I didn't notice anything worthy about him. After all, he was all for Christina being kidnapped. And she likes him????<br />3. &quot;Captive&quot; is a first novel. That's not to say all first novels suck. But I'd hazard a guess that if someone tried getting this published today, they'd be laughed at - if the editor ever made it past reading the first three sentences.<br />I strongly urge you to NOT read &quot;Captive&quot; unless you are dead set on curing insomnia. If you are new to Lindsey novels, then I would suggest you read &quot;Savage Thunder,&quot; &quot;Once A Princess,&quot; &quot;Defy Not the Heart,&quot; or &quot;A Heart So Wild.&quot; Or, if you need agood Arab romp, read Lindsey's &quot;Silver Angel,&quot; about an Englishwoman sold into a harem.

So I spent a torturous week reading &quot;Captive&quot; just so I can now say &quot;Heart of Thunder&quot; is 1) nothing like it and 2) far, far superior in every way possible.<br />The plot of &quot;Heart&quot;: To force an American rancher off his ancestral land, Mexican hottie and bandito Hank Chavez orders the kidnapping of the rancher's daughter, not knowing that the daughter is the same girl who jilted him.<br />The plot of &quot;Captive&quot;: Jilted desert Chieftain Philip tricks comely Christina into coming to Egypt so he can kidnap and steal her away to his desert camp, where he can make her his love slave.<br />Okay, the common denominators are &quot;jilted&quot; and &quot;kidnap.&quot; But that's about all these books have in common. &quot;Heart&quot; is passionate, with spirited, likable characters who show gumption and can barely keep their hands off one another. &quot;Captive&quot; is an exercise in patience, so wooden that it's difficult to feel anything for the characters - even when they are hurt.<br />In typical Lindsey fashion, both books have key elements: good guy gets hurt, bad guy comes after girl, baby is involved. Most of her novels follow this pattern (like &quot;Brave the Wild Wind,&quot; &quot;When Love Awaits,&quot; &quot;Warrior's Woman,&quot; etc.). So those don't count as similarities, in my opinion. But, in &quot;Heart,&quot; these elements are exciting and keep you turning the pages. In &quot;Captive,&quot; you wail, &quot;Will this EVER end??&quot;<br />All in all, &quot;Heart of Thunder&quot; is a sexy, steamy story with lots of appeal. Be warned: it is a sequel. Be further warned: its prequel &quot;Glorious Angel&quot; is pretty blah, but I won't go into it here (read more about me to see my review on &quot;Glorious&quot;). I would never put &quot;Heart&quot; in the same category as something as pedestrian as &quot;Captive,&quot; and heartily recommend it as an extremely enjoyable read.	2004-07-04

In fact, it is mediocre compared to some of Johanna Lindsey's other Western romances, like &quot;Angel&quot; or &quot;Heart of Thunder.&quot; It can't even come close to competing with &quot;Savage Thunder,&quot; JL's best Western romance and best novel EVER.<br />It did have likable characters. Marion has gumption, especially in standing up to her obnoxious twin sister, Amanda. And the hero Chad has his moments of wit and interest. But they aren't fiery together. Alone, they aren't even that interesting (Colt Thunder or Chandos - two of JL's hottest Wild West heroes - could probably have entire novels about them ALONE, and I'd read it).<br />I think the problem with &quot;A Man to Call My Own&quot; is in the narration. JL spends a lot of time saying this or that happened, but never describes the actual scene. For instance, pivotal to the plot is a train robbery that happens early on in the novel, but JL devotes perhaps two sentences to the entire event. She also says Amanda is a bitch and Marion is the sweet, sensible one, but we don't get too many scenes involving this. Just the statement. If JL devoted more time to fleshing out the characters, I would have warmed to them. As is, they are not that memorable. In fact, not a single scene in this novel stands out as great or exciting, which is a shame, since it had such potential with certain events and meetings.<br />The other problem is that JL devotes this story not just to a happy ending with Marion and Chad, but also with Amanda and her beaux, AND with the twin's aunt and her beau as well. The ending is too tidy for me, too gooey happily ever after, especially following the not-too-intriguing storyline involving the dad's death.<br />Added to that is the fact that &quot;A Man&quot; is a mishmash of older JL storylines. For instance, Marion wears glasses to make herself look ugly, just like Roseleen in &quot;Until Forever&quot; (Tanya of &quot;Once A Princess&quot; is more original by using makeup to hide her beauty). We also have twins changing places - just like &quot;Joining,&quot; &quot;Silver Angel,&quot; &quot;Tender is the Storm,&quot; and &quot;All I Need Is You&quot; (which, coincidentally, involves an abandoned stagecoach, too). Then you have the plotline about the hero marrying the wrong girl, which we already saw in &quot;The Heir.&quot; Throw in a shotgun wedding straight out of &quot;Brave the Wild Wind&quot; and &quot;Angel,&quot; and you have yourself a patchwork quilt of rehashed stories called &quot;A Man to Call My Own.&quot;<br />Altogether, &quot;A Man to Call My Own&quot; is all right if you've never read a Johanna Lindsey romance before. But serious readers would be better off going for any of the other JL's mentioned above. For a sensational Western JL experience, read about Colt Thunder and his Duchess in &quot;Savage Thunder&quot; or Chandos and his Cateyes in &quot;A Heart So Wild.&quot;	2004-07-02

I was a teenager then, and a HUGE fan of Johanna Lindsey, so I couldn't understand why she would write a romance about a man and woman raping each other. Needless to say, this book went on my list of &quot;never to read again&quot; obscurity. Luckily, I threw away that list!!!<br />I just reread &quot;Prisoner&quot; and, to my absolute surprise, enjoyed it immensely. It is a provocative book, but the rape scenes weren't as outrageous as I remembered (actually, they're pretty hot). The heroine Rowena is the one who starts raping Warrick, after all. Not because she wants to, of course, but because she is the victim of her scheming brother's greed and either has to straddle manly Warrick or watch her mother die. What would you do?<br />To say the least, Prisoner is one of JL's more steamy romances. I think half the book takes place in bed somewhere. Rowena and Warrick are fun characters, too, both with strong, likable personalities. It's hard not to like everyone in this book. Even Gilbert, the bad guy, has redeemable traits.<br />My biggest criticism of &quot;Prisoner&quot; is how closely related plot- and character-wise it is to JL's earlier work, &quot;So Speaks the Heart.&quot; Both are medieval romances, both have blond lovers, both revolve around the knight treating the lady like a slave because of something bad involving the lady's brother, and both deal with pregnancies. However, &quot;Prisoner&quot; is the better book of the two, with stronger characters and a more intriguing storyline.<br />I personally would recommend &quot;Prisoner&quot; any day as a great medieval romance. However, if it sounds like too violent a book for you, read &quot;So Speaks the Heart&quot; or Lindsey's other medieval (and fantastic) novels &quot;When Love Awaits&quot; and &quot;Defy Not the Heart.&quot; If you're in the mood for time travel to the medieval period, read JL's &quot;Until Forever,&quot; about a gorgeous Viking with a cursed sword.	2004-07-01

Johanna Lindsey outdid herself with &quot;Once a Princess,&quot; a novel about a girl raised in a Mississippi tavern who is really a long lost Eastern European princess.      Tanya is a splendid heroine. She is feisty, spirited, and witty, AND she knows how to stand up for herself. Stefan is her perfect match: dark and brooding with &quot;devil's eyes,&quot; the future king of Cardinia fights fire with fire, with some passionate results. The two are an excellent pair together and fun to watch.      The fact that Tanya absolutely refuses to believe she's a real princess leads her into quite a few adventures as Stefan and his dashing companions escort (er, kidnap) Tanya back to Europe. Stefan's three companions are great characters, but the best is Vasili, the nasty conceited peacock who is so gorgeous women fall all over him. Of course, he gets his own book in the sequel &quot;You Belong to Me.&quot;      What else can I say about &quot;Once a Princess&quot; but read it, read it, read it. It is my second favorite JL, the first being &quot;Savage Thunder.&quot;	2004-06-30

As a Lindsey historical romance, it doesn't disappoint on the passion factor. The hero and heroine have a love-hate relationship, but it's easy to see why they'd fall in love, and such a pleasure to watch them try to deny it.<br />Tough-as-nails Jessie is headstrong and has a fighting spirit that allows her to run a ranch by herself one minute and integrate with a renegade Cheyenne Indian band the next. Chase is the no-nonsense gambler whose devotion to his stepmother leads him into constant clashes with her daughter and ward, Jessie.<br />There's a lot of fun stuff in this book. First, the Indian scenes are a delight and include two fascinating characters: Jessie's closest friend White Thunder and the Sioux warrior Little Hawk. Jessie's mysterious illness is also engaging - how often do you see the heroine of a romance get obnoxiously sick all over the place? And Chase's little run-in with a robber brings to life a conflict over the ownership of Jessie's ranch. It is also nice to see the guy in danger for once, rather than the girl who needs rescuing! <br />More importantly, though, Chase and Jessie make a great couple. Their clashes energize the story and keep you reading all the way through.<br />The only real complaint I have is over what happened (or didn't) to Laton Bowdre. I also wasn't too fond of the last few chapters in Spain, but only because the situation with Rodrigo seemed a bit forced. However, these aren't enough to detract from the story, which I thoroughly enjoyed.<br />&quot;Brave the Wild Wind&quot; is a delight to read. Be sure to read its two sequels, &quot;Savage Thunder&quot; and &quot;Angel,&quot; as well. &quot;Savage Thunder&quot; is my all-time favorite JL and the best of the trilogy, with White Thunder as the hot male lead.	2004-06-30

From the gripping first chapter in which the hero, Colt Thunder, is almost whipped to death for being half-Cheyenne, to the many, many HOT love scenes, &quot;Savage Thunder&quot; is a wonderful story you just can't put down.<br />I adore Colt, who is the best JL hero EVER!  He is a moody, dangerous &quot;breed&quot; who struggles to control his desire for Jocelyn, a widowed English Duchess as fiery as her red hair.  The pair has great chemistry together, whether it is in sizzling repartee or a tumble in bed (or, in some instances, on a horse).  <br />The storyline is also intriguing.  Jocelyn is plagued by an assassin out to kill her, and this puts her in some interesting positions, including being kidnapped.  We also get to meet &quot;cold-blooded&quot; Angel at this point, who gets his own story later on in the aptly titled Lindsey romance, &quot;Angel.&quot;<br />Whatever criticisms I have about &quot;Savage Thunder&quot; are minor.  For one, Lindsey went into A LOT of detail describing extraneous scenes like the famous showdown in Tombstone with Wyatt Earp.  She also brought in Billy from &quot;Brave the Wild Wind&quot; as the reason why Colt was in Arizona and, of course, literally runs into the Duchess.  But Billy is forgotten after that (I wouldn't mind Billy getting his own story, by the way).  <br />I recommend &quot;Savage Thunder&quot; with a passion.  It is the best Lindsey romance, in my opinion, followed only by &quot;Once a Princess.&quot;  However, before you read &quot;Savage Thunder,&quot; read its awesome prequel, &quot;Brave the Wild Wind,&quot; where Colt is still living with his Cheyenne tribe and is known as White Thunder.  Then, after you read &quot;Savage Thunder,&quot; be sure to read &quot;Angel,&quot; which takes place just days after &quot;Savage Thunder&quot; ends.	2004-06-29
US	50810207	R1WFNF19SN2YLN	0380756285	880483902	Angel (Wyoming-Western Series)	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Sexy Gunslinger Story	&quot;Angel&quot; is the third in a series of romances set mostly in the wilds of Wyoming. In this Lindsey novel, the hero is an intimidating gunslinger named Angel, more often called the Angel of Death, because he never loses a fight. He is called down to Texas to repay a favor of a man who saved his life. The favor: to keep a &quot;meddler&quot; named Cassie from getting kicked out of Texas by the two families enraged at her botched attempt at matchmaking.<br />Both Angel and Cassie are interesting characters, Angel more so for his tragic upbringing and his highly dangerous, but mostly lonesome career as a hired gun. Cassie is perky with her fine lady mannerisms and rancher upbringing. With her flair for getting into other people's business, she can't seem to stay out of trouble. Plus, she has an eccentric homelife, which includes a pet panther from Africa named Marabelle who loves to clean her teeth on bare toes.<br />The story is fun and the action nonstop, from the first chapter's opening showdown at noon to the final &quot;showdown&quot; between Cassie and Angel, with stampedes, brawls, and all sorts of crazy things thrown in between. Angel's search for his identity is also an important element in this novel, and it is treated with care. The only &quot;fluff&quot; extraneous scene happens at the very end and I won't go into detail, but it doesn't serve much in my opinion other than to get Cassie's unconventional mom to like Angel.<br />Altogether, I enjoyed &quot;Angel.&quot; It is fast-paced and witty, and it brings back all the characters from &quot;Brave the Wild Wind&quot; and &quot;Savage Thunder.&quot; Of the three books, however, I thought &quot;Angel&quot; was the least passionate. &quot;Savage Thunder&quot; is, by far, my favorite Lindsey novel EVER and it was where Angel made his first brief, memorable appearance. But the spark between Cassie and Angel isn't as strong as with Colt and Jocelyn of &quot;Savage Thunder&quot; or Jessie and Chase of &quot;Brave the Wild Wind.&quot;<br />I highly recommend &quot;Angel.&quot; However, I'd first read its two prequels, &quot;Brave the Wild Wind&quot; and &quot;Savage Thunder&quot; (in that order) to familiarize yourself with the storyline and to wet your appetite for &quot;Angel.&quot;	2004-06-28
US	50810207	R2JRN7SQ06P9DA	0380762595	742024238	Until Forever (Avon Historical Romance)	Books	4	33	36	N	N	Fun time-traveling romance	\\"Until Forever\\" isn't your typical Johanna Lindsey historical romance. Yes, it does have a medieval cast and crew, but only because the modern-day heroine, a history teacher named Roseleen, travels through time to the Norman Invasion with the help of a cursed Viking sword.    That same sword also comes with a hunky Viking named Thorn, brother to the Norse God Thor, and cursed to serve the woman who possesses the sword. Of course, Roseleen and Thorn's visits to the past screw up history, with some very interesting results. It's definitely a new twist on a JL romance!     This was a fun story. I rather enjoyed the details about the Norman Invasion. I also thought that Roseleen and Thorn had strong personalities and enjoyed their interactions - especially those times when Roseleen had to explain the modern world to Thorn. It was hysterical to see his fear over riding in the car and how fast he destroyed the (moving) kitchen appliances. The shower scene was pretty hot, too.    I had a couple minor objections to the story, which is why is has a 4 rating rather than a 5. For whatever reason, Lindsey stops the story every so often to explain women's liberation or some other inane topic during, say, a love scene. It was so jarring! For another, Thorn has a mortal enemy who appears in the last few pages of the book, and his and Thorn's battle to the death comes across as fluff. Then Lindsey resorts to a silly tactic to make Roseleen appear unattractive, which is to give her glasses she doesn't need (she also does this to Marion in \\"A Man to Call My Own,\\" which was published later). Either drop the glasses ploy completely or really make the heroine blind (which could be interesting); faking a need for glasses is simply insulting to those who actually have to wear them.     Altogether, \\"Until Forever\\" is a charming read. If you like this story, you may also like the \\"Warrior's Woman\\" trilogy, also by Lindsey, which involves sci-fi interplanetary romances between modern-type heroines and barbarian-like warriors from a \\"primitive\\" planet.    Update as of November 29, 2004: I just read \\"A Knight in Shining Armor\\" by Jude Deveraux, which is the second time-travel book I've ever read, and I have to say it is absolutely amazing!  \\"Until Forever\\" sucks in comparison.  In fact, if I compared the two books to desserts, \\"Until Forever\\" would be a gingerbread cookie while \\"A Knight\\" would be a steaming chocolate souffl drizzled in hot chocolate and topped with powdered sugar and whipped cream.  It was that yummy!  If you had to read one time-traveling romance, I would recommend \\"A Knight in Shining Armor\\" any day.	2004-06-24

I fell in love right away.  I couldn't wait for Johanna Lindsey to write his sequel, and am quite pleased with the results.<br />To summarize quickly, &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; throws together gorgeous Vasili with wild Russian Alexandra, a tomboy and horse breeder.  They are duped into a betrothal by Alexandra's father and plot endless amusing ways to force the other to break it before the actual wedding takes place.<br />Vasili is simply exciting - the &quot;peacock&quot; is so insulting and contrary it's a pleasure to once again see him in action.  As for Alexandra, she's his match in spirit and temperament, returning his barbs and hot air with equal passion.  Plus, she is so jealous she threatens to cut off the ears of all of Vasili's &quot;women,&quot; which makes for a fun scene or two.<br />Speaking of &quot;other women,&quot; Lindsey also spices up the story with Alexandra's refusal to give up hope that her first love, Christopher, will marry her.  Add to that Vasili's numerous conquests - including his own personal concubine - and you find grounds for a few serious arguments between the unwillingly betrothed pair.<br />The passion between them is fun, whether it's love or hate, and the setting allows for a lot of action.  After all, they are traveling by horseback and wagon from Russia to Cardinia, Vasili's hometown, for the wedding.  This allows bandits to sneak up on them and other fine messes to follow.  Plus, everyone from &quot;Once a Princess&quot; makes a welcome appearance.<br />The only negative things I can say about &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; is that Russia wasn't used as much as a setting.  If you'd like to read a hot Russian romance by Lindsey, read &quot;Secret Fire&quot; about Prince Dimitri and the Englishwoman he steals.  Plus, &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; is very similar in plot to &quot;Joining,&quot; a later Lindsey novel, in which the medieval hero and heroine practically kill each other to break their unwanted betrothal as well.<br />The only reason I didn't give &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; 5 stars is because its prequel, &quot;Once a Princess&quot; is an all-time favorite and, in my opinion, 10 times better.al hero and heroine practically kill each other to break their unwanted betrothal as well.<br />The only reason I didn't give &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; 5 stars is because its prequel, &quot;Once a Princess&quot; is an all-time favorite and, in my opinion, 10 times better.	2004-06-23

Set in Barikah in the Middle East, &quot;Silver Angel&quot; runs on the premise that Englishman Derek Sinclair impersonates the Dey of Barikah -- also his twin brother -- while the Dey seeks out his would-be assassin. In the meantime, Derek disrupts his brother's harem by pursuing a newly acquired, utterly rebellious concubine, beautiful Chantelle, who was kidnapped off the coast of England and sold into slavery. The detail Lindsey puts into everyday harem life is amazing, and you end up absolutely fascinated with the setting alone. Add to that the fact that Chantelle is a spirited, fiery, and vulnerable heroine, while Derek is a sexy (and considerate) master, and you end up with a sumptuous read. Amazingly, they don't actually make love until page 300, but their nonstop interplay is so sensual and passionate, you never even notice. There are several unforgettable moments in this novel, such as the first time Chantelle is brought to the Dey's palace, as well as the attempted poisoning. The secondary characters also capture your attention, including the eunuch in charge of guarding Chantelle, the Dey's first wife Sheelah, and Derek's mother, the grand dame of the harem. <br />&quot;Silver Angel&quot; is only one of two Lindsey books set in the Middle East. The other is &quot;Captive Bride,&quot; her first novel, and not a very good one at that. I highly recommend &quot;Silver Angel&quot; not only for its exotic locale and interesting tidbits about Arab life, but also for its smooth story, outstanding characters, and intensely satisfying romance.	2004-06-22

The first time I read it was around 12 or 13 years ago. I just reread it this weekend, and it was just as fresh and exciting as the first time! Chandos is one of the most rugged, dangerous, sexy, and altogether tragically romantic heroes JL has created (only Colt Thunder of \\"Savage Thunder\\" can beat him as the ultimate JL hero, in my opinion). Courtney, though timid and shy at first, has so much spirit and grows so much in Chandos' care, that she's wonderful to watch. It was exceptionally fun to see how Cateyes (as Chandos called her) handled being attacked by that monstrous gunslinger Pretty Boy and, much later, by Calida - a beautiful rival for Chandos' affections - in an unforgetable catfight. Hero and heroine aside, the love scenes are hot, the plot is fast-paced and interesting, the supporting characters are memorable, and the action is intense. Plus, there is a dark side to this story that will immediately grab hold of you, making you want vengeance as much as Chandos. I highly recommend reading \\"A Heart So Wild,\\" especially if you like the Wild West and Indian stories. I did finished reading its sequal \\"All I Need Is You\\" yesterday, and must admit I didn't care for it. The sequal in no way had as much passion, daring, or heartache as in \\"A Heart So Wild.\\"	2004-06-22
US	50810207	R3EMKMF9JQ0ZI	0380814714	78646061	So Speaks the Heart (Avon Historical Romance)	Books	4	12	14	N	N	Nice medieval romance	&quot;So Speaks the Heart&quot; is satisfying as a romance, though it's not one of Lindsey's best efforts.  Set in medieval France, &quot;So Speaks the Heart&quot; is the story of Brigette, a lady who is left in the scheming hands of her greedy aunt after Brigette's brother dies.  The aunt conveniently gets rid of Brigitte by duping Rowland, a knight returning to Normandy to protect his father's lands, into taking her.  From that point on, the lady is mistakenly treated as a serf and wench, but she and the knight eventually find true love despite it all.  <br />Some people might take offense to Rowland's initial roughness with Brigette, but I didn't think it a big deal.  If anything, this story mirrors Lindsey's later novel, &quot;Prisoner of My Desire,&quot; which was also set in the medieval times, had blond lovers, had a pregnancy, and had a lady treated as a serf by the knight who owns her because of a problem involving her brother.  Considering that Rowena and Warrick of &quot;Prisoner of My Desire&quot; actually do rape each other repeatedly and fight like cats and dogs, the problems between Brigette and Rowland of &quot;So Speaks the Heart&quot; pale in comparison.  And since I read &quot;Prisoner of My Desire&quot; first and rather enjoyed it, I thought &quot;So Speaks the Heart&quot; was a lot less engaging.  <br />Still, the plot of &quot;So Speaks the Heart&quot; was steady and the twist with Rowland's family pretty good.  I also enjoyed Brigette's dog Wolff, who was a particularly worthy canine hero.  Don't get me wrong: &quot;So Speaks the Heart&quot; has a good story with likable characters, and I'd highly recommend reading it, though it's not favorite material.  <br />My advice is, if you are at all offended by &quot;So Speaks the Heart,&quot; do NOT go near &quot;Prisoner of My Desire,&quot; for you will hate it immensely.  Read &quot;Defy Not the Heart&quot; or &quot;When Love Awaits&quot; two other medieval romances by Lindsey, instead.  If you dolike &quot;So Speaks the Heart,&quot; then definitely read &quot;Prisoner of My Desire.&quot;  You'll see the similarities, and I think you'll agree &quot;Prisoner&quot; is the better story.	2004-06-22
US	50810207	RBB5CWUVYTU1O	0380792028	726577953	Glorious Angel (Southern Series)	Books	2	6	6	N	N	No plot, shallow characters	I've been rereading all the JLs (so far, I've finished 18 in a month), and &quot;Glorious Angel&quot; is just as I remembered it 10 years ago: unappealing, passionless, and actually quite tedious. It is one of JL's first books, and it is obviously a pedestrian effort. The &quot;love&quot; dialogue is beyond cheesy and the love scenes are tepid. Worse, it has a meandering plot that starts with Angela's crush on Bradford as a child (why she likes him, I'll never know), then moves on to a rags-to-riches story with Angela losing all of her Southern white trash talk (which was actually quite charming), to a forced separation based on a rumor of incest that really never seemed to upset Angela other than to make her run away from Bradford. The best part about this book is that it sets up Hank Chavez's story in &quot;Heart of Thunder,&quot; which is a million times better. In fact, only a single year separates the publication of &quot;Glorious Angel&quot; and &quot;Heart of Thunder,&quot; but somehow JL's writing style, sense of character, and dialogue improve tremendously during that short time period. Which makes me suspect that &quot;Glorious Angel&quot; was written long, long before its publication date and published without the benefit of editing, rewriting, etc. That's too bad. &quot;Glorious Angel&quot; could have been much better had JL spent some more time playing up the passion and personalities between Angela and Bradford and less time on fluff like matchmaking in Texas and the pointless assassination attempts on Bradford's life (as an example of how silly this book is, Bradford is tied to a chair in a burning house and his fear of death gives him He-Man strength to break through the ropes, no knife or anything, to escape. Wow!). If you are interested in Wild West romances written by JL, I highly recommend &quot;Heart of Thunder,&quot; &quot;A Heart So Wild,&quot; &quot;Once A Princess,&quot; or &quot;Savage Thunder.&quot; I do not recommend &quot;Glorious Angel&quot; unless you want to read it as a prequel to &quot;Heart of Thunder.&quot;	2004-06-21

The plot of the story is British privateer (pirate) Tristan spies the beautiful Bettina on her ship as she sails from France to St. Martin in the Caribbean to marry her betrothed.  Tristan, of course, wants her for himself and steals her away.  The rest of the story is rape, escape attempt, rape, escape attempt, rape, escape attempt, and then they fall in love.  When I read this 10 years ago or so, I was pretty outraged by the whole thing and hated this book with a passion.  So I was rather reluctant to re-read it, but since I'm now re-reading all my Lindsey's, I figured I'd suffer through this story, then move on to an outstanding JL romance, like &quot;Savage Thunder.&quot;  Little did I know that, instead of being upset all over again, I matured enough to realize this book is just a good example of poor writing and, quite honestly, it is so dumb and so bad it is actually quite funny to read.  I mean, Bettina actually stomps her foot in anger -- like every five pages.  Not only that, but how many times can she get her clothes ripped off her?!? Worse, every time she escapes, she runs into somebody who also wants to rape her (therefore, making Tristan the lesser evil among the rapists)!  Throw in cheesy dialogue and overall ridiculous characterization (Bettina is so-o-o-o innocent she doesn't even know what &quot;rape&quot; or &quot;making love&quot; are at the beginning of the book), and you've got a great book to laugh at. The only thing good about &quot;A Pirate's Love&quot; is the urge it gives you to visit the Caribbean.  If you want to read a seafaring JL romance, go with &quot;Gentle Rogue&quot; or &quot;Magic of You.&quot;  They are a trillion times better than &quot;A Pirate's Love.&quot;	2004-06-21

I found it a fun read, and --speaking as a college student who is just as impressed as Nanny is with Prada, Gucci, etc. while struggling to pay the rent -- easy to relate to.  While I don't think it was funny (nothing is funny about neglect and abuse), I found it witty and entertaining.  It could even make a better movie than a book, if someone took the time to streamline the story.<br />My big complaint was the subplots involving Nanny's family and boyfriend.  I felt that Nanny's family was way too supportive of her; in fact, there was no conflict involved anywhere with either Nanny's family or the boyfriend, so I wondered why they were even there at all -- other than to provide a stark contrast to the Xes' horrible family values.  Luckily, the passages involving Nanny's family and boyfriend are relatively short, so they don't detract too much from the plot.  It would have been much more realistic and interesting had the authors spent more time developing Nanny's family and boyfriend into a real family (with its fights, jealousies, etc.) rather than give her the perfect family to run back to when the Xes step out of line again and again.<br />Regardless, this is a fun book to read.  I think the only people who could possibly dislike it are the very same people that the &quot;Nanny Diaries&quot; decries: selfish adults who think nothing of their spouses and children.  The &quot;Nanny Diaries&quot; is definitely worth reading at least once.<br />However, if you want social commentary wrapped-up in a great story, try &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austin.  Now that is  literature....	2003-04-29

Both books were moving and thoroughly got into the heads of the criminal, yet they further confirmed my belief that the death penalty is necessary and an important feature of American justice.<br />&quot;In Cold Blood&quot; is beautifully written with as many lovely images and lines as in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot; or the Christmas short-story.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because Truman seemed to speed up toward the end of the novel and, in my opinion, didn't really spend to much time with Dick or Perry during their final days.  For instance, after learning about Perry's horrible family life, the bird dream he repeatedly has, and many other fine tidbits in his life, Truman never really discussed how Perry felt about his upcoming execution.  I felt a cheated out. (Also, Truman tried to hide his own character in the novel by referring to himself as &quot;a journalist&quot; -- a bit tacky.)<br />Finally, I just want to remind readers that this is a true story about real people.  In many ways, regarding the characters involved, it is much more fascinating, in-depth, and &quot;human&quot; than any fiction novel could be.	2001-06-30

But this novel was an absolute disaster.  First of all, the author does not  know how to write and should be sent back to grammar school.  Secondly,  where was the fantasy?  Basically, the Irda were depicted as Krynn's  version of blue-skinned, modern-day Americans.  On top of that, the most  important element of their culture -- the fact that they were transformed  into ogres -- happened so fast and ended so abruptly that you had to wonder  if the author was just plain tired from writing such a pointless story. The  book was boring, disappointing, and a waste of time and money.	2000-01-05

By far, Khisanth is the most memorable &quot;evil&quot; character and, quite honestly, the most interesting.  The only thing that  bothers me is her ultimate (and unfortunate) fate at the hands of the  heroes in the Dragon Series.

Unfortunately, my brother gave me this book for Christmas (he knows that I like to read, but  he doesn't understand that I have standards) -- and, like the dummy I am, I  actually wasted time reading it.  The storyline was unbelievably  predictable, and the characters were one-dimensional and shallow.  Not only  that, but the author is either not very subtle or assumes that her readers  are idiots.  How many times must she refer to the twins switching places  and loving each other to death in order for us to understand what makes  them tick? Please, Danieele Steel, stay away from historical novels and  PLEASE stay away from the subject of identical twins.  Or else, write  something that is interesting and original.  And readers, if you want to  read something that is romantic and historical as well as intelligent and  interesting, go for Sir Walter Scott's &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; or, if your not  into classics, at the very least, Johanna Lindsey.

My friend and I absorbed it within a weekend, and we each agreed it was neither satisfying nor believable.  The beginning of the novel was promising -- it  has some interesting metaphors and the girl's story was mesmerizing.  Then  there was the oh-so-promising conflict bwtween the two beautiful geishas.   It began with a band, and just sizzled out by the end of the novel.  But  what destroyed this novel was the fact that it was way too obvious than the  author, a man, was trying to write as a woman.  He was clumsy and  unrealistic when it came to the sex scenes; he probably should have  consulted his wife at this point and asked her what it was like to lose her  virginity.  Anyway, it was an interesting book, but it did not live up to  its expectations.	1999-12-31
