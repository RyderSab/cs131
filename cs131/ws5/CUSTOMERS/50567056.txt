But how can you not sit back and say, \\"Poor Sid\\"? As others have mentioned, the ending is emotionally devastating, not tragic, yet somehow appropriate.<br /><br />I wish Stegner had written a follow-up novel about the remaining 2 Adams and the crippled Eve. It would have been interesting.	2005-10-06

Walsh's text is an explicit condemnation of state-sponsored violence in Argentina. He concisely sets the historical background of the illegal assassinations in a Buenos Aires garbage dump that took place during a failed coup d'etat in 1956. The random selection of the victims is a chilling indictment of the Argentine military, as well as the chilling knowledge that Walsh himself was a victim of the military and is listed as one of the thousands of disappeared Argentine citizens from the 1976 military takeover.<br />This is a clear and courageous book. I highly recommend it for students of Latin American history.	2005-09-28

The story has its tense moments and I recommend it for those interested in military dictatorships in Latin American. Of course, you should see Littin's film, too!	2004-10-13

Read Faulkner as the master of the stream of consciousness technique. To the elitist reviewers who &quot;Can't believe this only has a 4 star average&quot;, wake up to the fact that this book repulses many people, and it's NOT because we can't understand the content; it's that we see through Woolf's shallow and dull story telling masked by over-the-top modernist phrasing. Seriously, this is by far the most overrated &quot;classic&quot; in our literary cannon.	2004-09-22

Okay, I'll start this review by saying that I'm glad I read this trilogy. However, I don't understand the 5-star ratings. McCarthy's writing is inaccurate.  It's one thing to put poor grammar and incomplete ideas in the uneducated speech of the protagonists, but when the descriptions include these errors, it's quite disturbing. He LOVES subject pronouns (HE, SHE, etc) and at times the reader has no idea who &quot;HE&quot; is. The writing is surprisingly unclear at times, peppered with incomplete sentences.  Also, the writing is full of Spanish sentences that he does not explain to the non-Spanish speaking reader. I speak Spanish, so this didn't bother me. However, the poor and inaccurate Spanish grammar in the mouths of Spanish speakers did.<br />Here is my breakdown of each of the novels:<br />1)  ALL THE PRETTY HORSES:  I enjoyed the story, but the conclusion was weak and not convincing.<br />2)  THE CROSSING:  By far the most annoying of the three books. The random episodes, the ambiguity of characters, the philosophical meanderings of certain characters, and the stark and long descriptive passages were almost too much to handle. The first 100+ pages are about Billy and a wolf! Needless to say, not a very exciting beginning.<br />3)  CITIES OF THE PLAINS:  The fastest-paced story of the three and the most engaging. The novel's conclusion, however, is ruined by a HORRIBLE 25-page epilogue that mirrors the long, philosophical &quot;meaning of life&quot; passages that doom THE CROSSING. Without this ending, the plot of this novel is the most exciting.	2004-07-20

The writing is beautiful and the characters memorable. Alexandra is a great yet flawed protagonist and her struggles throughout her life reflect the universal struggles that occupy us all.

There are beautiful, compelling, heart-wrenching,and inspirational moments. Kantor at times demonstrates a fine ability to evoke certain images.<br />The problem is that not every episode is captivating and the reader often has to wade through pages and pages before reaching the &quot;literary payoff&quot;. At times I wondered if I would ever finish the novel. A decent editor could have trimmed this book by 200-300 pages and I believe the novel's impact would not have been changed. I do recommend reading this novel, but with reservations.	2004-05-14

I recommend reading this autobiography, although I do think it is too long and certain sections could have been eliminated.<br />There are some extremely funny episodes, but for me the most powerful writing was the last chapter about the death of his daughter Jean. It is an extremely moving glimpse into Twain's heartfelt pain.  Reading this life story has made me want to revisit the high school classics of Huck Finn and Mark Twain.<br />4 stars.	2004-04-08

Honestly, I thought the first 400 pages were more compelling than the conclusion. However, this book is quite remarkable.  The Biblical theme of Cain/Abel with Charles/Adam and Caleb/Aron is a haunting revelation into the complex balance between good and evil that defines us as human beings. Cathy (Kate) is without a doubt the most devious and evil literary character I've encountered EVER in literature. Every scene she was in I couldn't wait to see what happened!<br />I do recommend this book, despite its flaws, because the glimpse into humanity is powerful. It did concern me a bit<br />too when I realized that 3 of my 4 children are named Adam, Caleb and Kate!	2004-02-03

My only regrest is that I hadn't read this novel before seeing the movie &quot;Gettysburg&quot; several times.  The characters in the novel are so compelling and profound, much more so than in the film. As soon as I could disassociate Martin Sheen (whose performance in the film,quite frankly, was stilted and awkward) with the character Lee in the novel, I learned so much more about the Southern general and I began to appreciate Shaara's literary accomplishment. Being a fan of Civil War novels, I was very satisfied with this book. I highly recommend it.	2004-01-23

It cracks me up how Hemingway refuses to write swear words and the word &quot;obscenity&quot; becomes a verb, ie. We are obscenitied!<br />The obvious Spanish syntax is interesting as well and I imagine that those not fluent in Spanish would find the English both twisted and awkward at times.(example, Hemingway writes, &quot;For a favor, do this!, which seems a direct translation of &quot;Por favor&quot;.<br />Another example is &quot;How many years to you have?&quot; (Cu&aacute;ntos a&ntilde;os tienes) instead of the proper English &quot;How old are you?&quot;.  It's as if Hemingway wrote the dialogue in Spanish and then translated it word for word into English. I'm not sure if this is genious or annoying.<br />Regardless of this goofy English, the novel is a good read and I recommend reading it.	2003-12-28

It was the innaugural choice for a newly-formed book club of college professors here in Idaho, so with much of the book taking place in Boise, I wanted to &quot;connect&quot; somehow to the state I'm in.<br />The &quot;historical&quot; story between Oliver and Susan was by far the most satisfying. I didn't really appreciate the way the story was &quot;framed&quot; through the eyes of Lyman Ward, Oliver's grandson. Those sections of the book seemed the most tedious to me, although I do understand their relevance.<br />Their lives are unhappy, full of unfulfilled desires, and thus tragic. It's a haunting story that left me somewhat unsatisfied at its ending.<br />Overall, I would recommend it for its strongest point, a sweeping view of western life in the 1880's.	2003-12-21

It's pacing is slow and uneven and the narrator repeats ideas and themes. The character is interesting, although flawed in character. After his wife dies, he leaves his children in England to be raised by other people while he pursues his adventures all around the world, often in the name of \\"Christianity\\". I think a true christian would have been less selfish and stayed with his children! He abandons them and runs around the world for the rest of his life. He never even talks about his children after leaving them! Some may point to R. Crusoe as an anti-imperialism novel, but for me, I was more impressed by his crappy parenting. I guess I'm glad I read it. Maybe it's considered a \\"classic\\" because we can all learn from Robinson.	2003-11-26

Here I am, writing this review of a book I read at least 7 years ago. But, like any great book, I still remember Lucy Marsden.<br />(Like I remember David Copperfield, Don Quijote, Natty Bumpo, etc.)<br />Perhaps Gurganus's novel doesn't belong with those other classics, but I remember Lucy!<br />I agree that the book should be shorter. That doesn't change the fact that you should read this story.<br />The most powerful impression that this book gives is that the flowing of time separates us from other generations but there are messages and memories preserved for us to experience and from which to learn.<br />When Lucy compares the confederate veterans hanging out in the town square to the vietnam vets hanging out in that same town square, the effect is dizzying. We came from previous generations and others will come from us, live in our houses, drive down the same streets we do, etc. Lucy serves as a reminder that time passes but things don't necessarily change.<br />The novel's portrayal of history is indeed special.	2002-11-16
