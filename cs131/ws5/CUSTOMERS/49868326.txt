While this is not in the class of \\"Season...\\" or \\"Good Walk...\\", it wasn't meant to be. It's a good book for a young adult audience that may not be interested in reading.

He is always very readable but the substance of this effort is far below his previous standards. The prose is good and the story is somewhat compelling but , in the end I felt as hollow as many of the characters he created. His portrayal of the students of DuPont U. does not ring true to any college student  I know (and I do know quite a few). He paints his portraits of his characters in broad strokes and seems to find no one of substance.  I was very disappointed in this book.	2005-08-20

Robert Caro's \\"Master of the Senate\\" is the third volume in his Lyndon Johnson series. He is a master storyteller. This volume not only covers his years in the Senate (1948 - 1960) but gives a history of the Senate and how it works. He fleshes out the supporting cast of Senators and brings us inside the Senate cloakroom as history is being made with the Civil Rights legislation of 1957. The writing is suberb. Caro may be the best writer (of any kind) in America today. I'm ready for Volume 4. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!	2005-06-30

This is the true story of one man's survival against incredible odds. It is a short book (less than 200 pages) but not what I would call an \\"easy read\\".

The last quarter of the book the pace quickens and it becomes a very compelling read. I found that it ended a bit abruptly and could have used a longer epilogue.

It is not a pretty sight. We find out they began planning the War in Iraq days after taking office. And that they've squandered the budget surplus on tax breaks that have not stimulated the economy (against the advice of their leading economists). The most disturbing insight has to do with President Bush. The picture that is painted is one in which he has little if any insight into the world and the issues around him. He has surrounded himself with idealogues. Mr. O'Neill is an amazing man with an unbelievably gifted mind who is not afraid to tell the truth. Every American should read this book before they cast their ballot next November. It may be THE MOST IMPORTANT BOOK OF THE YEAR.	2004-02-17

Mr. Irving was truly an original voice. In &quot;Piggy Sneed&quot; he has given us a memoir, some short stories and essays. The memoir, &quot;The Imaginary Girlfriend&quot;, is the best piece in the book. I enjoyed the fusion of his wrestling career and his writing career.  I enjoyed the short stories and his attempt to share with us his some of the craft of writing. The homage to Dickens was enlightening and inspiring. I found the final piece of the collection (the one on Gunter Grass) the most difficult to read (perhaps because I haven't read any of his work but the piece has not inspired me).

However, I got this book as a Christmas gift and read it in a couple of sittings. It is predictable in many ways but the plotting kept me interested and intrigued. The &quot;You can't go home again&quot; theme has been played many, many times throughout literature. Grisham holds his own with his attempt at it. The book is a snapshot - recreating a time and place, a mood and feel. The character of the unseen coach is revealed in graceful complex style, through the eyes of those who  knew him. The awakening of the protagonist is somewhat predictable but Grisham still manages to avoid making it unbelievable. A very good read.	2003-12-28

He presents to us with a multi-layered telling of his running of the most famous of all races. He tells us his story but also gives us an entertaining history of the race and those who have run it. He also introduces us to the merchants and spectators who line the course each Patriots Day. This was a very enjoyable read!!! Highly recommended.	2003-11-02

Mr. McMurtry's writing is excellent but the story really goes nowhere. It takes the Lonesome Dove characters and gives them some advevtures for their middle years. Woodrow Call and Augustus McCrae are full fledged Captains now. The time spance of the novel is too long and the stories are too disjointed. Characters are introduced and dropped. An example of this is Captain Scull, who is given much time in the first half of the book ( and is quite interesting in a Theodore Roosevelt sort of way) but is reduced to a caricature in the second half. This book was in dire need of some editting. I liked \\"Deadman's Walk\\" and I loved \\"Lonesome Dove\\". This book was best summed up by Woodrow Call's las line \\"It may be over but it wasn't fun\\".	2003-08-22

This is the story of a mid 30's guy in early 90's London coming to terms with his inability to commit to relationships. The internal monologue is so well written, and rings so true. If you are a woman and want to know how guys think - READ THIS BOOK. If you are a guy and CANNOT relate to this book  - well, we can't hang out.

He flashed on the running scene and broke Jim Ryun's high school mile record. Those of us in Michigan were excited by his arrival at U of M. But after one year he's gone. Lear does an excellent job of telling the tale of that year. Webb's intensity, immaturity and lack of patience come through loud and clear even though Lear does an excellent job of presenting both sides of the arguement. This one does not quite measure up to \\"Running with the Buffaloes\\" but  that is a classic. Great, quick read if you are a runner or a fan of the sport.	2003-07-12

Crichton does a great job of feeding the reader hard to digest scientific/ technical facts in format that is easy to understand (I think?). As always, the plot is futuristic and told in a \\"this could happen \\" style. It is a page turner and a compelling read. There is a real JURASSIC PARK feel to the structure of the novel, the character quality and behavior.

I have been a big fan since I read \\"The Prince of Tides\\". Mr. Conroy has always had a decidedly autobiographical tone to his fiction. This is autobiography written with the eye and ear of one one of our country's great writers. Mr. Conroy's prose is magic. Like all great writers he transports us to another time and place.

From the start I had the feeling many parts of his life were being glossed over (What did it feel like to grow up in that house? Why did he quit college? How did he meet his wife?). The racing and training sequences were great. The section on his Boston Marathon was outstanding. When his injuries force him to give up running the narative gets choppy again and seems to lack insight. The farm accident was interesting, enlightening and horrifying. Much more could have been done with his descent into the world of drug addiction and the pain it caused his family (it may have been me but I never got a feel for his wife and son ).

I found I had a hard time sustaining interest in the book. I did not find the characters to be well drawn. Ms. O'Brien seemed to be so in  love with her prose that I had difficulty understanding the motivation for  her characters behavior. This seemed more an exercise in the writing of  prose than in the crafting of a novel.	2000-05-29
