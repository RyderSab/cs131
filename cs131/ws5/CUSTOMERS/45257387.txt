The original \\"How to be Your Dog's Best Friend\\" is by any measure, a very complete and substantial dog book ...    This new revised edition is more than set to continue as a \\"classic\\" in its own right ... The revision is quite substantial - incorporating new understanding & the changes that have taken place in dog training over the past decade ... and the book continues to mirror the love & devotion that Skete Monks have always had for dogs.    Your Dog's Best Friend is by concept and intent is not just a \\"mere\\" dog training manual and offers much much more to the reader ...    The book covers a whole spectrum of topics from ... how to find/select a puppy ... cooking for your dog ... basic grooming ... basic training ... training for obedience competition ... including a section comprising of 9 chapters on how to deal with common problems related to living with dogs (with a chapter how to cope, when a dog passes on) ...    Not so commonly found in other dog books ... Your Dog's Best Friend also has a section titled \\"Sensitivity Exercises\\" ... dealing with issues of dog behaviour & dog behavioural patterns, and explains dog loneliness, dog silence and dog dreams ... This section also suggests various exercises (massage) and training (round robin recall of life), designed to enhance and make precious the people/dog relationship ... GREAT! ...    Another great section covers the spectrum of \\"Environments\\" where the Monks of New Skete explore city/urban life, suburban/country life and the great outdoors.    Written in conversation-like style, the book comes alive through the use of well chosen anecdotes, humour and the Monks' own distinctive approach & philosophy to life & living ...    The book makes for very easy reading, and in its clarity - makes for easy appreciation & understanding ...    But most of all - I have come to really like this book because - it touches me ...    \\"Myths, Mutts, and Monks\\" ... \\"What is a Dog?\\" ... bring warmth to the printed page, and thebook urges the reader to begin a wonderful journey towards deeper & greater understanding of our canine friends ...    The Monks write \\" ... Because dogs are guileless and utterly themselves, they lack the capacity to deceive. if we take seriously the words they speak to us about ourselves, we stand face-to-face with our own truth.\\"    A very good book ...	2004-11-23

Please place emphasis on the word \\"Encyclopaedia\\" as it appears in the title ... <br /> <br />Apart for the first 30 odd pages of introduction, where the author explains aggression & fear as perceived by dogs ... the rest of the book is arranged in alphabetical manner ... <br /> <br />The book covers a wide range of dog behaviours ranging from Abnormal Behaviour, Body Control, Classical Conditioning to Visual Communication and Xenophobia ... making the book a good reference source. <br /> <br />For example, under the title \\"Dominance & Submission\\" ... the author explains the role that dominance plays within a dog hierarchy, and how the \\"dominance - submission\\" relationship between dogs, is more of a learned behaviour based on experience, rather than just based on the physical appearance/size of the dogs. <br /> <br />The drawback with the format is that it makes for rather disjointed reading and is not quite a book to read from cover to cover ... and requires the reader to jump from topic to topic ... <br /> <br />Content-wise, the book provides reasonable information, very sufficient for the new or first time dog owner. The more experienced dog owner will probably want to look at books by Patricia McConnell, Clarence Pfaffenberger and/or Stanley Coren. <br /> <br />That said ... it remains a useful book to have in the library ... <br /> <br />4stars ...	2004-11-17

Together with Karen Pryor's \\"Don't Shoot the Dog\\" ... Jean Donaldson's \\"Culture Clash\\" encouraged me to re-examine my relationship, my methods of training and attempts at communication with our dogs ...    Jean Donaldson has a no nonsense writing style ... she says it like she believes and thinks - no excuses, no grey ... take it or leave it ... and there is no where to hide ... the reader can either agree or disagree but there is little doubt in Ms Donaldson's own mind ... And she tells it from the dog's perspective ...    Unlike many training books that just set out the procedures & techniques for training a dog ... Culture Clash takes us one step further along the road ... and helps the owner/trainer understand why certain training methods work better than others ... Why positive & operant training methods coupled with an understanding of dog behaviour, instincts & psychology is the way towards a less frustrating, less stressful and more successful method of teaching/training our dogs.    Culture Clash is a training manual, in that it teaches us how to teach/train our dogs - it is more than a training manual because Ms Donaldson also explains how dogs think and perceive our methods & style of training ... she explains why & what makes dogs nervous ... why & when dogs bite ...  what makes our dogs tick and do what they do - or not do ... she tells us what may or may not work ... she tells us of the various psychological thresholds that exist within all our dogs ... and she does all this with clarity & in detail.    No Lassies and no Rin Tin Tins - the author describes our dogs as they are ... and offers us an insight and understanding into their true nature ... and she writes of what is really required to build and maintain a meaningful & responsible relationship with our dogs.    The book offers the reader a deeper appreciation of what is going on in the dog's mind as training progresses ... making for more effective training, and perhaps most important - improving our relationship with our dogs ...    But the least the book will do - is make us re-think the aspects and elements of our relationship with our dog ... and that cannot be bad ...    Culture Clash is a wonderful balance between a dog behavioural book and a training manual ...    A good reference book ... a worthwhile buy & read ...	2004-11-16

Books	5	63	66	N	N	A very good book on how to teach/train difficult dogs	If you liked Ms Jean Donaldson's first book \\"Culture Clash\\" - you will like \\"Dogs are From Neptune\\" ... In fact, I would suggest that this book is a necessary follow-up.    \\"Dogs are From Neptune\\" is written in Ms Donaldson's distinct and forthright style ... The author is clear in her views and sure of her methods ... The reader can either agree or disagree but there is little grey where the author is concerned ...    That said - Ms Donaldson writes in an incisive way, expressing her thoughts in a manner that makes for easy reading ...    \\"Dogs are From Neptune\\" is a collection of case studies ... dealing with \\"difficult\\" and \\"problem\\" dogs - dogs with whom the more traditional training methods may not work so well ...    Together with Patricia B. McConnell's books, \\"Dogs are From Neptune\\" make essential reading for any owner/trainer interested in or needing to learning how to use positive training methods to \\"re-condition\\" a dog with difficult temperament or bad habits, ranging from counter surfing, food & object possession to the more serious issue of dogs that bully, dogs who are difficult to handle and dogs exhibiting nervous or defensive aggression ... The Editorial Review above provides a good summary of the areas covered in the book.    I found the use of case studies particularly the details provided - most useful ... by providing background to the \\"difficulty\\" faced by the respective dog and its owner/trainer ... the book allowed me to appreciate & understand with greater clarity the intention & purpose behind the methods used and suggested by Ms Jean Donaldson ...    Essentially, the book format adopted by the author, brings meat to the bones of training ...    And it doesn't take long for the reader to realise, that while the case studies are by their very nature specific to each case ... Ms Donaldson's methodology, rational and style of training & teaching a dog - can easily be adapted/modified to meet the range of difficulties and issues an individualowner/trainer may face with his/her own dogs.    The book emphasises and teaches why it is so important for every owner/trainer to first understand basic dog behaviour, instinct & psychology and how using such knowledge & understanding in the teaching/training of our dogs reduces frustration, stress & trauma to both owner/trainer & dog, and increases our chances of success.    Most important, the author teaches us how to maintain through all difficult times, the essential bond of trust between our dogs & us.    All in all ... the book is detailed and very sufficient ... A very good read and a worthwhile buy ...	2004-11-16

Good way to start reading the Battletech series	Having played the computer games based on BattleTech ... I was intrigued enough to want to read some of the books, but with a series as extensive as BattleTech - I had great difficulty finding a good place to start ...

TLJP traces the life of Aidan Pryde ... from his early days in training, to his finest hour, when he leads a band of \\"unwanted\\" warriors into battle ... and in so doing Aidan redeems honour,  heritage ... for himself and those who follow him ...    All in all a wonderful trilogy, filled with Mech battles & strategy ... a well constructed storyline (without the sometimes glaring gaps found in series of this nature) ... satisfying characters sufficiently developed to hold and pull the reader's interest ... I was particularly & pleasantly surprised at how the author developed the character of Aidan's daughter ...    But more than just 3 ripping good yarns ... for anyone wishing to get into the BattleTech world ... this is a good book to start with!!! ...    Without breaking storyline, or getting too pedantic, the reader is gently but surely given a wonderful introduction to a basic but sufficient history ... of MechWarriors trueborn & freeborn, of the importance of Bloodnames, of the Clans (how they came into existence & what they represent) ... of the history & conflicts between the Inner & Outer Sphere ... Descriptions of the BattleMechs & weaponry are nicely done too ...    All in all a price worthy trilogy ... and a great introduction into the world of fighting Clans and their giant war machines ...

She offers no methodology or training style save that of daring to listen to our own hearts and learning to hear the heartspeak of our dogs. More than just explaining dog psychology she dares us explore and extend the boundaries of communication between our dogs and us.<br />She writes of how, if we extend grace to our dogs, we also receive profound and nurturing grace in return, one that enhances not just the relationship with our dogs, but enriches our friends, family ... our lives in a quite magical way.<br />More than just a book about dogs, it is a book about living with dogs, and with ourselves.<br />She writes \\"...

Paper quality is reasonable but the binding (for such a heavy book) could have been better. A few rare breeds (possibly extinct) are depicted with drawings, but all other breeds are represented by at least one photograph (often more). Photograph reproduction is unfortunately only of average quality.<br />Chapters describing each major dog group (Gun Dogs, Herding Dogs etc) preface the book, providing the reader with useful introduction to canine diversity and function<br />Each breed is described by country of origin, weight, height, coat, registry and group.

A very strong manual on how to train doggies ...	If you don't believe in physically reprimanding your dog under any circumstances ... then this is not your book ...<br />But if like us, you believe that perhaps, there may not be such great divide between new and older training methods, as many are wont to have us believe - and you are prepared to keep a reasonably open mind ... then give this book a try ... there is much to learn here ...<br />This is very much a reading book, but the writing is well done, humorous and light. The author writes convincingly in a conversational manner but without excess and remains focused on the primary purpose of the book - teaching us how to teach our doggies ...<br />Content-wise, the book is substantial and covers a wide range of behavioural &amp; training topics, from (a) how to teach the basic commands, (b) how to deal with common problems, from excessive barking, jumping, biting &amp; aggression, to (c) training the doggie for the obedience ring.<br />Remarkably, all the above is accomplished in a comfortable &amp; complete manner. At no time does it seem that Mr. Terrel is dealing with or rushing the reader through any issue in a superficial manner. Nor were we left with the impression of impossible complexibility. The book is well balanced and there is always much to appreciate &amp; consider. <br />Characteristically, an issue or problem is identified or discussed, the author then provides a series of possible alternative training methods, some his own, others which he has read or heard of, and may or may not have tried. Where appropriate Mr. Terrell presents his caveats and recommendations in reasonable detail, explaining how and why a particular training method might or might not work. The author explains that no one training method is suitable for all dogs. <br />Many training manuals simply suggests a method for training or eradicating a problem, but stops there, and does not tell us what to do, when it doesn't work! This book offers multiple options, which we find particularly useful (and we are free to choose what we think best for us &amp; our dogs). This adds the much-appreciated dimension of flexibility.<br />Structurally, book is reasonably well indexed, and makes it easy for a more experienced trainer (or those wishing only to address a particular issue) to read selectively without need to plough through all the pages; adding value and making the book a good reference source.<br />Yes, Mr. Terrel is not adverse to 'paddling' the dog, but it must be said that the author does represent this (often most sensitive) aspect of training carefully and only advocates physical handling or reprimand within very limited boundaries &amp; within the context of the severity of the problem faced by the trainer.<br />Nevertheless and while we are ourselves not particularly convinced that physical reprimand is the answer ... that does not detract from the value of the book as a whole. We take the approach that we don't have to agree with all that Mr. Terrel writes, to appreciate he has much experience, from which we can (albeit selectively) learn. Whenever physical reprimand is suggested, we substitute the physical reprimand with another form of acceptable reprimand such as low growls, withholding of attention, temporary confinement etc etc ...<br />Good training manual.	2002-02-26

Great book for anyone wishing to start clicker training	When I wrote the first review on this book in May 2001, I had been using this book for a month or so and was suitably impressed. I was also just beginning to invest in clicker training.<br />9 months on (many books later), and having trained (or at least partially trained ... *grin*) 3 dogs, I'm no longer as convinced that newer operant training methods have as distinct an advantage over classical/traditional methods, as some writers would have us believe. We are discovering that all training methods (including the clicker method) have their respective strengths &amp; weaknesses. What many writers don't say is that much depends on the dog itself or that combination training methods work well too. <br />But that being said ... the clicker is still the most effective way I have discovered of informing my dogs when an action is approved ... its quick, extremely simple &amp; precise ... one click and the dog knows that it has done right ... no buts, no ifs - that's it!<br />Depending on time, mood and disposition, voice commands can vary in tone and quality - the clicker is consistency paramount.    <br />When used properly, the clicker is one heck of a communication tool ... and this book's value is that it teaches a beginner very quickly how and when to sound the clicker ...<br />This is a book consisting primarily of drawn illustrations ... very few words ...<br />And they say a picture is worth a thousand words - therein lies the secret and effectiveness of this book ... the illustrations are as precise and clear to the reader as the sound of the clicker is to the doggie ... The pictures convey in quite a remarkable manner - a clarity of timing to the reader that might otherwise have been lost had words been used ...<br />The reader will find all basic commands such as sit, heel, stay &amp; come dealt with in the book, including aspects of (a) how to 'shape', namely, to lead a dog progressively towards a behaviour that is acceptable to the trainer; and (b) targetting, which is teaching our doggie friend how to nose or touch anything we indicate ... teaching a dog to target, allows us to then teach the dog more complicated commands, such as closing doors and turning switches on and off ...<br />This book is great investment for anyone wishing to start clicker training ... If the reader wishes to progress beyond basic training, or wishes to learn more about how and why a clicker works, then the reader may have to get other books ...<br />But as start-off manual - this book is one of the best!	2002-02-26

It lists a fairly large number of breeds, including some breeds not recognised by the AKC. Each breed is described generally, with details on temperament, training and exercise requirements.<br />Although the book achieves its primary purpose, it does so in a rather pedantic manner, making for dry reading. The layout and language comes across as rigid and repetitive. Some of the colour printing lacks sharpness and falls short of many other breed books. Certainly many of the photographs could have been better taken, and some breeds better represented in visual form. One is left with the feeling that many photographs were inserted as an afterthought, rather than as part of an overall design.<br />While one ought not to select a dog simply because of its looks - good images, well presented in a breed book will always be appreciated. Also, for some reason, the average life spans of the breeds are not provided.<br />The book's strength comes from (a) its convenient size, and (b) the fact that it includes several breeds more commonly found in Europe, which do not commonly appear in other breed books (for example: Central &amp; Eastern European Hounds &amp; Herding breeds).<BR>But otherwise, there are more lively and well-designed breed books around.<br />Closer to 3 and a half stars than 4 stars ...	2001-11-06

Ms. Welton has produced a most practical book for those wishing to find a pup as companion and family member ...<br />The author prepares the potential new dog owner with all the necessary - from how to pick a breed to how to pick a pup, from how to pick a breeder to a timely caution on the time/effort required to rear a puppy ... While most &quot;how to pick puppy&quot; books may deal with the same topics, Ms. Welton does it exceedingly well, and the chapters are conveniently laid out, easy and fun to read ... <br />What we find most appealing is her description of the 200 breeds set out in the book (more than some breed books) ... Ms. Welton provides plenty of information about each breed (again, more than some breed books), from their expected temperament (including interaction with children) to expected life span, grooming requirements, genetic &amp; hereditary medical cautions, availability (in the US), estimated price etc.<br />After having served its primary purpose and guiding owner to pup - the book will continue to be a very useful addition to any dog book library - as a source of information and reference ...<br />The photographs could be better though - maybe in the new edition ...	2001-08-15

The book is hardcover, good binding, average quality paper, standard font size but the good layout making for easy reading. A substantial book, with 500 pages.<br />First published in 1979, Bill Tarrant was well ahead of his time; he's been using praise &amp; reward training methods long before the expression \\"operant\\" became vogue.<br />Primarily directed to training retrievers, Tarrant's method &amp; style is so honest - almost anyone wishing to train any breed will find the book useful and enlightening ... If there is one consistent message that comes through Tarrant's book, it is - NEVER HURT THE DOG!<br />Perhaps what makes this different from many others - is it becomes patently obvious even after a few pages that Tarrant is not teaching anything he has not tested &amp; tried, he is himself unafraid watch, learn and try different methods.<br />Consisting of 20 chapters, the author takes the reader from how to choose a pup to training the first fetch, from how to transport a dog to emergency first aid, from housetraining a puppy to teaching the dog to force fetch. When &amp; how to introduce a dog to water? ... How to train for a soft mouth? ... Gun-shyness, what to do? ... Tarrant deals with all and more ...<br />The book lays out training methods &amp; schedules and offers potential solutions to difficulties &amp; problems that may be encountered. Tarrant has developed his own training methods and procedure - some of which are rather novel. For example, he advocates using puppies to teach each other the beginnings of how to `stay' and to give to the lead.<br />Each topic is explained in-depth; each stage of training dealt with in detail.<br />Written with wonderful humour, the book is filled with anecdotes and stories collected from a lifetime of training &amp; living with dogs, the book is both entertaining and educational. More than just a training manual, the book teaches us how to better appreciate our dogs, respect the individual spirit within each animal and have better understanding of our canine friend.<br />A wonderful read.	2001-08-12

Good Value & Great Book	As befitting a book on photography, colour separation & reproduction are excellent, photographs printed on high grade gloss paper. The font might prove a tad small for some, but the ample spacing between lines does help make for easy reading. The binding on the hard-cover version is sound & strong.<br />As the title suggests, the book is not quite your usual travel photography book, certainly the chapters are not laid out in any conventional manner.<br />Chapter 1 deals with the author's own inner vision, of what creates an good image. Rowell is unafraid to share his philosophy on image making.<br />Chapter 2 explains how both equipment and mind can (and perhaps ought) to be pushed to their respective limits. Rowell is careful to emphasise that often - less is more.<br />In Chapter 3, Rowell writes about melding of camera person's mind's eye visions with the realities & practicalities of a field trip or expedition.<br />And finally in the last Chapter, Rowell shares his thoughts and views about how an image may be communicated to the world.<br />While the title does caution this is not quite your average photography book - the book itself is not some esoteric journey into the dark recesses of a photographer's mind. Rowell is much too pragmatic for that.<br />As always Rowell remained forthright and direct. The contentsensibly written, and helps the reader appreciate the mental preparations required to make good images on a field trip ... the book is by and large about how a camera persons needs to learn/understand how imagination, mind-set and perspective often determines the type & quality of images made ...<br />While not quite the book for the new photographer trying to figure out f-stops, Rowell does shares technical tips and suggestions for the making better & more effective images.<br />For many of us, a time comes when we begin to truly realise (not just mouth the words) but truly realise that getting the latest or most expensive equipment just isn't improving our images ... <br />And that's when we need to read this book ...	2001-07-15

This is a comprehensive book that covers most, if not all, critical aspects of handwriting analysis. What makes this book unusual and effective is the way its been laid out.<br />Ms. Nichol adopts quite a unique approach to the teaching of Graphology.<br />Rather than load the reader with lots of information (which can be a little difficult to assimilate &amp; digest) ... the author adopts more of a Question &amp; Answer type approach ...<br />Each chapter typically begins with the author providing sample handwritings of 3 persons, and then asking questions like: Which of the 3 stole from the employer, or which of the 3 is more reliable? (That each illustration is factual and taken from author's own experience, and not just some hypothetical situation - adds to the intrigue and compels interest)<br />Then, by using the 3 samples of handwriting as a base, the author takes the reader through a particular characteristic of handwriting (such as: pressure, slant, spacing or letter formation etc) which might help answer the question posed.<br />By adopting this solve a `who-dun-it' method ... the author has found a very effective and interesting way of teaching Graphology. It certainly kept me turning the pages ...<br />The book as a whole is filled with lots of little exercises and plenty of illustrations, all of which encourages reader participation and interaction. Although it takes a little getting used to, the book allows and compels the reader to put into practice almost immediately, what is being taught ... and this in turn, assists with retention and increases understanding ... <br />Very good book for anyone wishing to learn more about Graphology ...	2001-06-25

Notwithstanding the title ... this book is anything but a quick introduction into handwriting analysis ... As the author says ... &quot;this is not your usual  amaze and amuse your friends and neighbours type of handwriting analysis book.&quot;<br />This book is comprehensive, detailed - and requires reading with concentration ...<br />The author begins with the history and development of Graphology ... She explains why &amp; how Graphology works, the difference between the French 'atomistic' and the German 'gestalt' method of analysing handwriting ... she even tackles the ethics and morality of analysing someone's handwriting ...<br />Ms. Lowe takes the reader through all the elements of Graphology ... space, margins, baseline, the 3 zones, size, rhythm, connectivity, slant ... etc.<br />What distinguishes this book, is the depth and information provided. Each handwriting element is explored in detail, accompanied by plenty of illustrations, quick tips and anecdotes.<br />The author explains how handwriting analysis is a combination of examining each alphabet and stroke as well as viewing the handwriting as a whole as it appears on a sheet of paper, how one element or characteristic of handwriting may be counterbalanced or enhanced by other elements ... The reader is gradually taken from a basic to a finer understanding of handwriting analysis.<br />A good book. Great value.	2001-06-25

A good sized book, with good binding &amp; paper. The printing is clear, font type &amp; size well selected &amp; adequate.<br />Dr. Hamilton begins by explaining how as a veterinarian, he grew he grew increasingly frustrated with the limitations `modern' veterinary care; of how he was often only able to provide temporary relief, with ailments returning time and time again. He tells of his exploration into alternative veterinary medicine and how by the mid/late 90's, he had become convinced of the benefits of natural/homeopathic sustenance, prevention &amp; treatment.<br />The book is essentially divided into 2 sections:<br />a) The 1st Section contains a reasonably detailed summary of the history of homeopathic care &amp; sustenance, its nature, philosophy and development. Dr. Hamilton carefully explains the theories and principles behind homeopathic care, of how it deals with the entire being (pet or human), seeking always to identify and treat root causes of ailments and diseases. He expresses his concerned that 'modern' medicine is too often symptom oriented, and drugs are prescribed to suppress symptoms without curing the ailment itself. With symptom suppressing medication, relief is temporary and over time, ailments often reappear in even more virulent forms.<br />Dr. Hamilton cautions the reader of common pitfalls faced by beginners and emphasises that proper homeopathic care requires much careful &amp; systematic observation.<br />He tells how homeopathic care is deeply rooted in human civilisation and quickly dispels any notion that homeopathic remedies are 'quack' remedies based on old wives' tales.<br />(b) The 2nd Section consists of a series of chapters which carefully details common disorders and diseases afflicting our dogs and pets. From skin disorders to bloat, from cuts &amp; scratches to death-causing diseases (and practically everything else in between). The author explores causes and effects, and suggests homeopathic preventive care and remedies. Potencies &amp; dosages of homeopathic medicines are explained.<br />The chapter on vaccination is particularly interesting. This issue is dealt with in some detail and Dr. Hamilton is openly critical of the current vaccination practice.<br />An extensive list of further reading &amp; references is provided.<br />This book requires careful reading &amp; concentration. This is definitely not the book for a quick introduction on how to use aromatic scents &amp; oils ... but, I suspect will be invaluable reference for anyone seriously wishing to learn homeopathic care, diagnosis and treatment.<br />I know I'm going to have to re-read this book several times ... The book leaves no illusion about me being ready to prescribe any but the most simple of homeopathic remedies ...	2001-06-18

The author goes though the possible causes of each ailment &amp; condition and suggests remedies &amp; solutions.

The photographs have been invaluable in teaching us how to recognise and identify physical symptoms ... The photographs also allows us to make quick &amp; direct comparison between the condition we see in/on our pets with that described in the book &amp; depicted in images ... this allows us to make some sort of assessment (albeit, untrained) on issue of severity and urgency.<br />All in all ... the book is good value.	2001-06-15

There is a wonderful chapter on common ailments and possible natural remedies.<br />The author draws from numerous sources of information &amp; reference (all carefully indexed and referenced) and she reproduces conversations &amp; interviews with other practitioners of the art (including vets).

This is still a very good training manual providing much sound and good advice ... <br />From the previous reviews, this book appears to have been drawn into the debate (or is it battle?) between the proponents of newer training styles and trainers who still use slip collars and scruff shakes ...<br />For sure this book makes no mention of 'clickers' but neither does it advocate harsh punishment ... It is perhaps important to remember that the Monks are training German Shepherds, a strong and powerful breed. Even at 16 weeks, a GSD if not taught to curb aggression or dominant tendencies can prove to be more than a handful for any owner ... The Monks should not be faulted for  being firm with their GSD from a young age, ... they are firm but invariably fair ... they obvious love their dogs, and their training methods (if a little dated) reflect that love and care ...<br />We have a yellow Lab, and have never ever had to discipline her with anything more than a frown ... she is so mellow and loveable that training is more fun &amp; games than anything else, the 'clicker' works wonderfully well ...

Unlike many other authors/trainers, he begins with teaching the dog to 'target' rather than the usual 'sit, stay &amp; heel' ... innovative to say the least ... and it works.

The author draws on her own experience with 2 poodles ... as well, as the training &amp; trouble solving methods of other trainers ... this approach alone makes the book rather unusual and refreshing ... too many writers believe that theirs is the best or only way ...<br />Contains sound sensible advice, adopts gentle training methods ... with interesting chapters on dog nutrition and medication/inoculations that take an alternative (holistic?) approach ... worth considering ...<br />Oh ... and don't let the number `25' fool you ... the author covers almost all the issues commonly faced by dog owners everywhere ...<br />This book is very clearly written, well organinsed and makes for easy reading ... useful for all dog owners ... very good for first time dog owners ...	2001-03-19

As a basic training/problem solving manual, this book is okay ... first time owners will find possible solutions to a wide range of common doggie behavioural issues ... <br />But much of what is offered can be found even in basic dog breed books ... the various solutions suggested by this book will probably work with dogs who are reasonably socialised to begin with. If you suspect that the problem you have, might prove a little more stubborn ... then search for something more substantial ... try looking under 'Behaviour Problems, Dogs' ...	2001-03-19

Ever since we got our dogs ... we have been reading and reading dog related books ... mostly out of interest and sometimes because we needed advice with particular issues we're encountering with our canine family members ...<br />Some books were far too general, a few (fortunately very few) actually contained bad or poor advice ... most were reasonably good &amp; useful ...<br />But by far ... this is the best we have come across ... <br />The author makes no pretence at offering quick or instant solutions ... in the first few chapters and without emotional tangents (we all think our dogs understand us *laughs*) he takes the reader through the psychology and mindset of a dog, ... it becomes very clear that the author believes a dog cannot be effectively trained simply by rote, punishment or treats ... but through a process of learning to understand their true nature and positive healthy reinforcement ... <br />But what makes the most difference is that ... the author is prepared, without fear of alienating his readers, to require dog owners to delve into their own psychology and inner nature ...<br />This approach makes the book all the more useful ... it made me realise the futility of trying to train our dogs, without first considering how I might be affecting them, with my behaviour and reactions (conscious &amp; subconscious) ... I was asked to consider how my own understanding or lack ... might be causing or contributing to the dogs' good as well as bad behaviour ... The book also provides useful case studies and plenty of practical advice.<br />It does require a little more concentration than one would normally devote to the reading of a pet training book ... but the effort is well worth it ... any dog owner, new and experienced will benefit ...	2001-03-19

The author tells us that in order to correct a dog, oftentimes we must first as owners correct ourselves, our approach ... our whole attitude ... we are encouraged to try and learn the nature of dogs, their instincts and propensities ... the numerous case studies are also extremely useful ...

I'm partial to Rowell ... have been, ever since I started serious photography in '89 ... His photographs have always left me in awe ...<br />So you can imagine my surprise, when I found myself reading the words with as much care as I was looking at the photos ... Rowell carefully describes his preparations, his thoughts and preferences ... he writes as he photographs ... in a direct manner, with few affectations and no gimmicks ... The reader learns not so much about f-stops or apertures, but is introduced into the mind set of an adventurer, an exceptional photographer ... whose approach to image making is both pragmatic and inspirational ... the photographs are more instructional than usual ... but an exceptionally good read!	2001-03-16

Donnall Thomas Jr. ... This book and &quot;Labs Afield&quot; are 2 of the best photography books on Labradors I have found so far ... What can I say ... I don't like hunting but I think Labradors are wonderful ... and the collaboration between photographer &amp; writer celebrates the breed in quite an exceptional way ... If hunting photographs don't disturb you, then this wonderful book will help anyone understand how special it is to have a Labrador as friend and companion ...	2001-03-15

I was very much taken by the cover shot when I first saw this book on Amazon, the reviews too, seemed rather encouraging ... when the book arrived, I was expecting the rest of the photographs to be of similar or better quality ... am a little disappointed.<br />If this is an instructional book on how to raise or train Labradors, quality of photographs would not be so critical ... but its a pictorial book, and for some reason, quite a few of the photographs are missing that little extra ingredient which makes for really good photography ... perhaps if the photos had been more tightly edited, it might have made a difference ... At US$35 the book is not inexpensive, and there are better alternatives around ... just do a quick search, under photography and Labradors.	2001-03-15

I used to hunt a long time ago, but have since grown distant from any need to kill for sport ... so, I was initially rather hesitant about this purchase ... I've had the book for about a week now, gone through it from cover to cover, and must say the hunting element still disturbs me somewhat ... but the subject has been treated in the best possible manner ...<br />The book is well laid out, with quality paper and colour separation ... the photography is very good, the backdrops &amp; landscapes breath taking ... the dogs themselves are shown at their best ... sharing quiet moments with their human partners ... running, playing and working in water ... and doing that which they excel ... retrieving. A wonderful book for all who love Labradors ... and can keep an open mind about hunting ...	2001-03-15

What a lovely read ... its filled with history and information of this handsome breed ... includes a summary of how the dogs are fairing in different countries and a list of champions ... all obviously written by someone with great experience and knowledge ...

It's an impressive book to look at and hold ... quality paper and the photographs are very well done ... lovely printing and colour seperation ... But for a book this size, price and with the title &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; ... I was hoping to find more information about the dogs themselves. Most descriptions are brief. Perhaps too much space has been taken up by those wonderful photographs. So, unless the reader is into collecting pictures of dogs, the books offers little that an average/reasonable dog owner does not already know, or cannot easily find out with a quick search on the Internet for the price of a phone call.<br />More of a coffee table book perhaps?	2001-02-14
