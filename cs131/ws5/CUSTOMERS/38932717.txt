True, it is an unreachable utopia. But is that the only scale on which a book should be critiqued?<br />Communism has sparked a lot of reform. Though it has actaully ruined the laborers in the communist countries, in other more stable nations the workers were actually able to achieve reform applying concepts of communism more limitedly and less radically. It exposed that if such a document must be written, there must be something fixed in the mechanics of society, work, government, and individual. It's extreme distinction between haves and have nots, and the urge of the have nots to take over and rule in peace and equality may be drivel, but the impact it had on the labor movements and their rights is significant.<br />This is a very passionately written document, so of course there will be some loopholes in logic, misdiagnosis of what actually moves history, and an outlandish solution to the human &quot;problem&quot;. But think, you are holding one of the most influential documents, no matter how flawed, in the face of this tiny book that has made the world the way it is right now. Rather than berate for the shortcomings, praise for what it has gotten right. And who knows, maybe if Engels and Marx had not written this you might not exist today at all and the many european and the us governments as you know them might be still abusive toward the common wage slave.<br />Do learn from the example of this book that in ideas embraced by masses there is always a great element of madness. The truth, if there is such a thing at all, lies within the hands of one or few human beings. Communism is somewhat like...religion- a mass delusion. Learn!	2004-02-07

Through Meursault [indifferent, not hedonistic or emotionless, but responsive to physical pleasures], Camus shows how intolerant society is to alien points of view, and how it tries to intergrate the unknown into its rational system of values. By showing that life is purposeless and everyone will die at some point, Camus suggests that the &quot;evilness&quot; or &quot;goodness&quot; of an action are all the same. The ultimate triumph is the realization : &quot;So close to death, Maman must have felt free then and ready to live it all again. Nobody, nobody had the right to cry over her.&quot;; in two words- Amor Fati.

Campbell is a comparative scholar of mythologies, so expect many comparecents between world religions. Also note that the book is written in the form of a dialogue- interview.<BR>It is very easy and simple to follow the conversation- the language is not some convoluted elite jargon but simple human language. J. Campbell is obviously an atheist but not in a Nitzschean way. In fact he doesn't preach at all but lets you form your own conclusions about the subject. Some of his analysis of religions is very interesting and enlightening- I bet most christians never thought of the bible as a metaphor. Though, you could say that Campbell is too Platonic- there is a lot of idealism in his conception of the power of myth.<BR>The Point of the Book: The point of this book is to illustrate how a myth is still very much relevant to today's world, in spite of common conception. He doesn't, however, suggest we go back to old beliefs, but rather that we form new ones, foot-in-foot with modern mentality and fast paced world.	2004-01-28

Khidr's review- Penguin classics was right- misinterpretation is very abundant... The text with many aphorisms and the fascinating prose that distinguishes Nietzsche from a multitude of other writers &quot;dances&quot;- however the dance comes at a price to the reader- <BR>the dance is esoteric. <br />For those who say that the antireligious-antigod argument is weak, perhaps you'll be best served reading the Antichrist. Some Freud will do you well to explain psychology and how it leads to religion. Those who find psychological proofs unconvincing against God, are pretty much fools, as namely these arguments unravel the fabrication easily by showing the psychology behind the creation. As for the child-separated-from-the-mother, and thirst-leads-to-water arguments, I couldn't agree less. These are all physical arguments, while clearly religion and belief in God has rooted itself in spirituality; religion is far from praising physical attributes. Also, if you read psychology, the baby doesn't cry for its mother!-the baby cries for itself. Similarly, humans don't worship god!-they worship themselves. Besides haven't many authors already proven that creation of gods has been a means of control of power to actually disagree with Nietzsche on this point? And, thirst leads us to water? Hardly- I have never heard of anyone following their nose in a desert to water. Plus, once again this is a physical need while religion is spiritual. It seems that the only weak argument here is C. Khidr's.<br />As for the dominating-perspective anti-Nietzsche argument, this is clearly false also. Nietzsche himself states in Beyond Good and Evil, should you care to look, that this is only HIS perspective on truth. <br />How worshipping animals leads us to divine I do not understand. I hardly comprehend how the forms listed by C.Khidr manifest animal worship. Nietzsche says, and I agree, religion and current forms of government are anti natural, not to mention contradictive (have you ever though that in democracy freedom, equality, rights, and unity are incompatible?). And aren't animals part of nature? <br />He doesn't question his suppositions you say? Why, of course he does. If you have cared to read the introduction by r.j. hollingdale to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, he says that Nietzsche was forced to qualify, agree, or negate opinions within his own text because of the lack of audience at that time. <br />Remember, Nietzsche is not something to dive in head first and make immediate conclusions about.	2003-12-30

However, here lies the problem. These are the most acknowledged wors of Nietzsche, and as Kaufmann himself states in his biography of Nietzsche, Nietzsche's more private philosphy is a bit different from that which he put in his most famous book. Of course this is not as to discredit the philospher of the Complete works, but simply that the Complete works could have also included some of the lesser known material, as the Complete nietzsche does.<BR>     As to the critics of the inconsistency of Nietzsche's philosophy I have a message also. First of all ,and most fundamentaly, I do not understand why Nietzsche is observed in terms of other philosphers. If someone wants to disprove Nietzsche for his contrdictions and fallacies Nietzsche must not be viewed in terms of an unrelated outside subjects but in the terms of Nietzsche himself. If his critics would have done that and knew Nietzsche better than they apparently claim to, they would have known that Nietzsche was very dynamic in his philosphy, something that makes him attractive and easy to relate to. It is exactly this progress from religious to nihilistic to hopeful that produces an illusion of contradictions, while all along this are simple faults in trying to bridge the philosphies together without having to refute his older beliefs (Hollingdale, Intro to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Penguin Classics ed.). While some might believe that the dynamismn of Nietzsche destroys his credibility, the effect is obviously opposite. It is through his growth and incredible 180 turns that he is able to polish his philosphy and make it as perfect as possible. His philosphy is not something as static as of Kant (poor old Kant seemd to be obsessedwith Critiques), and static philosophies leave a lot of room in themselves for mistakes. Change, as Nietzsche believed was a fundamental process, and he especially stated this in a Zarathustra chapter, the name of which I cannot recall; it is a process that solidifies and perfects man, and this is what Nietzsche did to his philosphy.	2003-12-13

However, as with other books such as Plato's Republic, we are ultimately dealing with undercrediting human beings for their complexity. It seems that Hobbes is only able to see humans capable of being evil, brutish, and short, while not considering many, many, many other qualities a human can take on. I cannot blame Hobbes for being appaled at the sight of the war he fought, but this is only one face of human kind- a violent expression of the will to power if you will. Besides, if humans are so corrupt what guarantees that the people under the supreme ruler will not ultimately destroy the ruler with their brutishness? Above all, if all men are evil brutish and short how is it ever possible to find a ruler that may take over the people?<br />I cannot however discredit Hobbes for his influence on the more correct philosphers, such as Nietzsche (remember the Ubermensch?) and fortification against anarchists. We could have, however, done with out his obvious influence on nihilism, though it is not his fault forbeing misread.<br />A note on the edition: as always I was satisfied with the quality of Penguin Classics in introducing the text and the annotations. I give the edition 5 stars; but the content of Hobbes's philosphy deserved just 1.	2003-12-13

His relaxed life-style, however, is interrupted by the magician Gandalf who enlists Bilbo as a thief. Reluctantly Bilbo sets out on a pilgrimage with 12 elves to recover a stolen treasure from a dragon. While trying to accomplish their mission, the unlucky crew encounters countless adventures imbued with life-threatening dangers. Exceeding the elves' expectations, Bilbo becomes of great use in these predicaments. The final bloody battle is the climax of the book.<br />The alluring story line is something that will be parted with reluctance. However lighthearted the novel is, there is some profound symbolism and allusions to real facts. e.g. The final battle in the book is a blatant reference to the events of World War One, through which Tolkien has lived. He was obviously against it, as he demonstrates that myriads of decent, innocent people were obliterated. Also, basically the whole book reverberates the theme of maturing, demonstrated in Bilbo as he transforms from a timid creature to a more heroic persona.<br />Overall:This is a beautifully written book. The writing style used by Tolkien is commendable. The word choice is charming and amiable. The overall style is simple and lucid, but very enthralling and captivating. Definitely something that can be read for leisure. The same can be said of the story-line. It is very solid and well-knit together, there probably isnt a single loophole to taint its value. Filled with wonderful tales of magic and adventure it is second to none  in the fantasy class. One of those childhood books that will be fondly remembered later in life. It is only a shame that the sequels to this wonderful fantasy novel have plummeted in the content aspect and the delightful simplicity of Hobbit.<br />In addition to Hobbit, I would recommend The Chronicles of Narnia.Hobbit, I would recommend The Chronicles of Narnia.	2003-09-07

Its marvellous dissemination and public love and recognition beffudles me. Superficial, lackluster, and diaphanous often foolish and loathsome compourtment and intelligence of the characters makes this book nothing more than a wonderful waste of valuable time. Never has Shakespeare created a work so imbued with cliches and idiocy. Basically, Romeo and Juliet is a story about two romantically-impaired &quot;star crossed&quot; lovers who have to avoid the obstacles presented by the feud between their families to realise and consummate their ephemeral marriage. They arent star crossed! They are inane idiots too immersed in &quot;love&quot; to recognize the imprudence of their actions. Their deaths were not the least bit pitiful, but risible. Cognitive, yes. Irritating, yes. Interesting? No. The utter folly of the characters is murderous, very uncharacteristic of Shakespeare who usually presents intelligent and philosophical personages. Do not base your opinion of Shakespeare on this pathetic work, he has created and transcended this one with a myriad of his other much more meaningful and enthralling plays. I d much rather recommend Midsummer Night's Dream or Hamlet.	2003-09-06

Yes there is that aspect of novel to it, but it is so dilute and weak that it makes the fiction in this book unnecessary and redundant. Nonsensical, imprudent, and diaphanous fictional story line do nothing more than deface its value. The characters lack dimensionality and their personality and history are left in obscurity. The fictional story line is fragmented and disconnected. The ending is not only asinine but also obscene.

Perhaps it is a perfect guide to the philosophical thought for someone is in a hurry to be acquainted with it. Otherwise there are much more relevant works printed to provide much better information on the topic, to say nothing of the original works by the philosphers themselves.

Unlike the other translations, dense with tedious bombast and medieval suffixes, the Hollingdale translation is focused and one couldnt ask for a more keen choice of words. With this superb translation I could at least concentrate on the philosophy, rather than trying to decipher the difficult language. While reading this, the words danced rather than gravitated, making reading this book all the more enjoyable.<BR>As for the content and Nietszche's philosophy, it was intelligent and convincing. However one mustn't take this book literally. The transformation to Ubermensch is figuratively speaking, so is \\"dancing\\" and \\"laughter\\". In the context of this book one might interpret them as symbols of liberation and ascention. To best explain this one might take a scientist as an example. At first, the scientist burdens himself with study of the discoveries of his predecessors, in which he resembles a camel (1st transformation). After his vigorous study he must assert himself and his independence from others, in which he resembles a lion (2nd transformation). And thirdly, he must develop a distnctive personal style which will distinguish him from the others, in which he becomes like a child (3d transformation). In the 3d and final stage he is liberated from any signs of struggle, giving freedom to his spirit. <BR>However engaging Nietzsche's philosophy is, it is at times vague and sadly laconic, e.g. his account on the battle of the virtues was not expanded enough and didn't explain what one might do when those battled for supremacy. Also, some might find his philosophy callous and ruthless, as it persuades leaving the helpless behind for the sake of the ascention of few. Ruthless it may be, but accurate and very relevant. In addition, some might find it especially offensive and absurd as it sorns mercy and pity. Regardless of this aspect of it, I would say this bookis permeated with the influence of Enlightenment: striving to improvement and liberation. It is slightly atheistic which will deter fervent believers in god, but the atheistic thread is so subtle it would idiotic to sacrifice Nietzsche's philosphy for religious principles. Overall, an outstandingly written book.	2003-09-02

This is absolutely true of Ulysses, as the convoluted meditations of the characters and abrupt jumps from reveries and memories to actual events do a marvellous job to perplex the reader. <BR>Content: Countless riddles, allusions, metaphors, even intended misspells complicate the reader's life but hardly make this philosphical novel unreadable. Yes, philosphical novel, something you can meditate on after reading. Also, it seems that James Joyce has decided to intertwine modernism, Homer, Irish history, human ethics, and his view on religion and life alltogether, in parts creating a pulp of dense bombast. The modernist techniques are somewhat amusing at first, but after advancing deeply into the book they seem nothing more than ostentatious display by Joyce of his masterful writing ability. There are some faint references to sex and bodily functions, but so subtle as to leave me in mystery of the reason for its ban. Disseminated over a variety of subject, Ulysses does not fail to include relgion and allocate to it a share of the onus. However absurd the concept of religion is, it does serve a purpose in a few of the chapters. Also, Ulysses is famous for its blatant Homeric parallel: each chapter of Ulysses modeled on a Homeric adventure or character. It is truly amazing how the two are combined. To understand the content of this literary behemoth with more insight, one might consult either Pinkmonkey.com (free) or Cliffnotes, both equally helpful.<BR>Characters: The characters could have used a lot more dimensionality. Frugal on polishing their facets, James Joyce seems to be using them as puppets to mouth his philosophy and not much more. Usually a protagonist attracts empathy of the reader, but Joyce did a poor job with his characters as they seem very distant in their meditative drivel. In other words, there wasn't a single way I could relate to them. Even Joyce's flaccid attempt at adding flaws to their character by assigning obscenities, made them no more human or real. Perhaps simplifying the embellished bombast would have helped in understanding them.<BR>Overall: Despite its many flaws (e.g. length, verbosity, etc...) there is no other book that deserves your attention as much as this particular one. If you will just find perseverance to bear through Joyce's daunting baffling narration, you will be delected to have found it (perseverance) to finished such a marvellous literary accomplishment. Having said that, I favor \\"The Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man\\" by Joyce over Ulysses.	2003-09-02

The language flows smoothly and practically dances on the pages. The translation has engaged me and kept my attention, until I have finished the book alltogether. This rendition couldnt have possibly been improved.<BR>As for the tales, this is not like Disney's Alladin or Sindbad. Do not be deceived into believing that the stories are effulgent with simple innocence. In parts, there is mild violence and subtle obscenties. However subtle, one might still consider them inappropriate for children. To make it simple, if this was a movie it would be rated pg-13. This aspect aside, the stories flow smoothly with enthralling tales of adventure, magic, and of course the cliche themes of love. Even though the tales of this book have been displayed on television, this rendition flavors them with fresh originality. The only regret is that one wont be guessing about the outcome of the adventures as the ending has been millions of times entrusted to the media and us...	2003-09-02
US	38932717	R30SLT167JD2EW	0679413383	82353238	The Arabian Nights (Everyman's Library)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Engaging	Feigned as innocent and child-friendly by Disney, the book is a complete antipode of what it is has come to be popularly believed. The fairy tales are absolutely charming and the adventures enthralling as they swarm with magic and adventure, and...quite a few obscenities. This however does not diminish the value of  this marvellous book and an equally marvellous translation, but does taint it's reputation. But it would be truly foolish to let a few subtle obscenities deter one from engaging in the wondrously spun tales of Shahrazad. Also, I would highly recommend the second book of the Arabian Nights with the famous adventures of Sindbad and Ala-Al-Din and the magic lamp.	2003-09-02

Diaphonous, cliche, superficial, idiotic, meaningless, etc... this book hasn't even a single positive aspect. Rather than improve the mind of children and shaping them to become strong and creative, Harry Potter does the opposite, as it wastes valuable earth resources to permeate its pages with absurd, mind-numbing rubbish which has no value at all. Mind degrading, probably the only thing it does well is improve economy through massive sales the cause of which I cannot discern. Why are people drawn to that which is sensless drivel? Rather than being raised and challenged with philosophy and valuable classical literature, any reason is effectivelly and magnificently killed off by the sheer idiocy of this work. It's pathetic themes persuade meekness and mediocrity. In other words one might call it a literary crime. Rather than read Ulysses or Illiad/Odyssey which engorge the mind with ability to think analytically and creativley, children are directed in the harmful streamline of Rowland's Harry Potter. It is a leisurly read one might say. And another might respond, a badly chose leisurly read considering the myriad of more worthy engaging works that have been written. The characters are fools, the plot is idiotic, the theme is nonsensical, and idea of it blasphemous. I do however commend Rowling for her unexplainable success. And, a subtle presentiment tells me that I dont believe I could have accomplished such dissemination and massive recognition: No one listens to reason and good sense after all. Speaking of reason, the reason for the magnetism of this rubbish however is shamelessly perplexing and unfathomable by me.  So in conclusion, please, save a dollar, save a tree, save a young mind: Don't buy or read this nauseating drivel.	2003-09-02

Lucky was I to have picked out this book- it was more than I ever expected. First of all the setting is 19th century India, Himalayas. Three men go on a plant quest. Everything seems to go fine until they are trapped in a mountain valley where they have to finds means of survival.<br />Unlike many adventure books, not only is there action but also I found it very informative. It described a lot of the Indian customs and flora/fauna. Also this book was written in an attractive and amusing style: one that will not bore you much. The suspense will make you want to read more. So, in overall, a great book. One that not-nature lovers but adventure lovers should read.	2003-01-01

It is filled with intrigue, mystery, romance, vengeance and ,ultimately, murder. Its beautifully constructed plot and the whole motive of the murder, the clues and the amazing deductive powers of Sherlock Holmes will hardly fail to entertain you and keep you craving for more. Not only will you find crime and punishment on these pages, but also the unique world (the 19th century England) and personalities (cold-blooded Holmes and always left behind Watson) which Doyle has created. <BR>There is one downside to this marvellous classic. When you are done reading the book and there are no more adventures to consume you will feel nostalgic. One could only wish to relax in the comfort of an armchair in front of a fireplace while a rainstorm rages outside and Sherlock Holmes is patiently absorbing the details of another case, on No. 221B Baker Street	2003-01-01

How dissapointed was I when I finished reading this book. <br />First of all, Melville just loves to start discussing whales and sea and then somehow jump to an absolutely irrelevant subject, such as ponds and paintings. Secondly, if you are looking for adventure and suspense there may be some. However, what little there is of it, it is killed off by the very boring narration.<br />I thought there were some good points. It had strong symbolism, quite a good description of the life at the time and the life of the sailors. Must admit that the characters are masterfully created, especially Ahab with the solemn mystery of his life.	2002-12-28

I enjoy following Holmes' deductions, made by his incredible mind, based upon the smallest details, not observed by anyone else, leaving Watson behind in his own conclusions.<br />The whole book is based upon Watson's narrative of Holmes' crime solving career. Holmes and he travel to solve the cases which have been abandoned by government officials. Watson describes Holmes' investigations and observations, giving way to Holmes' powerful mind and being lost himself(in the deductions that is). It is incredible how the smallest details become the most important ones in solving an intricate case. <br />The cases are told through the &quot;mist&quot; in Watson's mind. He is never able to keep up and follow Holms' deductive train of thoughts. He is usually left behind by Sherlock Holmes and the reader, of course.<br />Sherlock Holmes can be viewed as a piece of a puzzle to make a perfect human. His calmness and mind trained in some aspects should be an example for many to follow. Disregard Holmes arrogance, coldness, and selfishness,add a few characteristics and you have an almost perfect human.<br />In overall this book is a must read. It is full of adventure and intrigue. Personally, I enjoy this book because yu can actually try and solve the mystery yourself(with enough details given, that is.) Read this, you won't regret the tme you have spent on it.	2002-01-03

Seton Thompson's skills in describing the animals, their lives, and even their feelings and thoughts are incredible. Reading this book you you practically live that particular animal's life<BR>Not only are the animal descriptions stunning, but so are the nature ones. Usually when an author describes nature, it puts you to bed. On the other hand Seton's are much more lively and fun to read.<BR>This book is a must read, one of the best nature books ever written. It helps you appreciate hte nature more.	2002-01-01

The book is filled with many humorous stories about the &quot;tribulations&quot; and &quot;disabilities&quot; they have and had experienced. One the most comical moments is the trio packing their luggage. Unfortunately, to the end of the story, the author evidently runs out of humorous scenes to narrate. Still, this book is a comical classic. <BR>The sequel to Three Men On A Boat, Three Men On The Bummel is less succesful. Despite, this it is still amuzing to to read J.K.J. describe the laws and customs of German people.<BR>Both Three Men On A Boat and Three Men On The Bummel are comical, clasical gems. It is amazing how J.K.J. combines history, humor, philosophy, and descriptions together. Some of the greatest books ever written.	2001-12-25
