That's to cause readers to ask how valuable they regard their faith in the God who's promised to put a punctuation mark on the end of history. Jerry's books are in a league by themselves. Yes, he crafts page-turner novels. But he also forces us to put ourselves in the characters' shoes and ask what we'd do if our lives depended on what we believed as eternally true.	2005-09-02

Many others will experience the \\"blues\\" that don't involve the cluster of symptoms of \\"clinical depression.\\"  That adds up to many, many women who will benefit from this book-if not for their own needs, then for those of people they love.  The book's title doesn't do justice to the comprehensive look Vernick takes at a woman's emotional life.  Twenty years ago, Jean Lush helped women realize the role their bodies' hormonal phases played in their emotional well-being. Vernick goes beyond that to consider the package of factors that weigh on women and push some into various definitions of depression. Her book comes with a warning: See a doctor and a counselor if you are having problems which might be depression.  But she also provides a great deal of self-help measures to help women identify and circumvent the problems that can sabotage emotional well-being.  Following each chapter and titled \\"First Steps,\\" they make this book one that can't be read and shelved. To derive full benefit you need to follow through on her suggestions, which include such things as journaling. Leslie's writing is personal and warm, and you get the impression that she really cares about you, the invisible person who has bought this book, possibly desperate for the help it offers. <br /> <br />	2005-05-11

That's the value of Nancy Kennedy's book on Bible women who prayed. From more than thirty Biblical women at prayer, she has chosen ten to illustrate key points of prayer.<BR>They include Deborah (strength and conviction), Hannah (help), Esther (courage), the Canaanite woman (mercy), the woman who needed healing (faith), Salome (boldness), \\"sinful\\" woman (contrite heart), Anna (persistence), Martha (hope) and Mary (joy). Kennedy pulls in other scriptures plus poignant personal stories to make this a for-real book.  You'll long remember, for example, the lawnmower story (pp. 29-31). You may also identify with Nancy's prayers when depression struck her daughter and husband. Each chapter ends with guided study and contemplation to make it a useful tool for personal or informal group study.	2004-03-31

For example: Dwell on your spouse's positives, not the negatives or \\"if-onlys.\\"  Guard against finding soul-mates elsewhere.  Be faithful in prayer. Deliberately love your spouse.

Robin takes us beyond that knee-jerk reaction, to open up understanding of the godly qualities all of Proverbs teach for women. I appreciated her ability to distill and organize the considerable advice of Proverbs, and present it with real-to-life stories that helped me see myself.  Robin also sprinkled the book with memorable quotes. I especially liked this from Fredrick Buechner in Wishful Thinking: \\"The place where God calls you to is the place where your deep gladness and the world's deep hunger meet.\\" Robin gives proper place to purpose (as opposed to frenetic activity), advocacy, control of the tongue, service, and stewardship.

Besides sharing from their own experiences with mentally and physically handicapped or chronically ill children and grandchildren, the authors have invited other special-needs parents to get to the heart issues of their lives. The book is chock full of practical stories, like having a coming-home party when a sick child came home from the hospital.  Or a \\"Blessings Jar\\" to help them focus on the positive. Having a trusted male relative take a wheel-chaired teen to the prom so she wouldn't be \\"dateless.\\"  Keeping thank-you cards in the car for when someone extends special grace.

Leslie helped adjust my perspective as she took me back to scriptures dealing with &quot;self-fulfillment&quot; and &quot;self-image.&quot; Her thoughtful, real-life book is full of sound-bytes. For example, in discussing joy (p. 31), she dismisses the world's definition (temporary pleasures or inner satisfaction of work or family), and says &quot;Those are all wonderful feelings, but they are fleeting, meant only to be tastes of something that points us toward the greatest pleasures and joy of all--knowing the presence of God.&quot; The personal applications at the end of each chapter will drive home the changes we need to make in finding true, Biblical joy.	2003-09-20

Whalin has done a fine job of explaining important Bible doctrines and summarizing the contents of the Bible books.  I noticed a few books missing (Ruth, Galatians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Titus and Jude), presumably because Whalin had to keep to the promise of getting the reader through the Bible in 24 one-hour study sessions. But for covering  the &quot;basics,&quot; and hopefully helping believers approach deeper study with more confidence, &quot;Alpha Teach Yourself&quot; is a worthy addition to the discipling shelf.	2002-12-27

Mary, of course, was the woman in the living room, and Martha was in the kitchen.  I appreciated Joanna's willingness to open up her life and provide memorable stories and fresh symbols.

Her book draws spiritual lessons from the lives of ten who knew Jesus, including seven whose names are lost to history.  They aren't lost, however, to the Lord, who cared for them genuinely in a time when women were second-class citizens.  Despite the gap of 2,000 years between our lives and theirs, we share their needs: salvation, compassion, faith, intercession, forgiveness, friendship with God, ways to love God, spiritual warfare, and spiritual intimacy. Vickey mines the few verses devoted to each biography for lessons for today's woman.

To adapt a title from the 1970s, this book is about &quot;The Total Communicator.&quot;  Florence and Marita help us understand communication from several angles, but, most important, coach us on how to make a difference with the words we write and speak. In keeping with their niche as personality analysts, they help us see we can change certain personality habits to better communicate with others. Recognizing that written communication is equally important, they include two chapters on writing notes. You'll want to bookmark the suggestions on what to write in difficult times, such as failure or bereavement. The last third of the book includes many of the suggestions offered in their training seminars for public speaking. If you find yourself frustrated in trying to communicate with other people, shy about saying what's on your heart, or just yearning to do it all better, absorb the real-to-life ideas in this book.	2001-08-23

She brings us to the basics about simple trust (enjoy her story about praying for a dishwasher), keeping the channels clear with God, and being a husband's cheerleader while doing--well--all the roles of mothering. She's lived through the challenges and gives us hope.	2001-07-20

Even if we hear that she is a Christian, we often have to watch from afar to see how she works out her faith in the workplace.  Lois Flowers has bridged that gap by providing ten intimate portraits of women who have meshed faith and business practice.  These are honest women who let us know where they have failed and where they have struggled, but who hold out the example that our jobs can be platforms for the glory of God--even high-stakes jobs where the cross is more apt to be an offense to non-believers.	2001-07-18

If you've hit mid-age with its &quot;power surges,&quot; increased body gravity, and bearded-lady-of-the-circus syndrome, you'll find a buddy in Laura Jensen Walker.  A breast cancer survivor who entered &quot;the change&quot; early, she knows that the ability to laugh at our bodies' &quot;wild stuff&quot; enables us to accept this time rather than resist it.  This is not a health manual, but a humor lesson.  Beneath all of Laura's joshing about the weird stuff of growing old is another story--that of a husband who is willing to help her hang on for safety as they ride the roller coaster of menopause together.	2001-07-12

I read Janet's book on a harried airplane trip and resolved to put it into practice when I got home.  I did and am glad I did.  Janet approaches this discipline as a fellow walker on the journey, and doesn't make you feel inadequate if you don't walk as much as she does or have to miss a day or so. She knows there are some mornings it's hard to get out, but encourages you with the joys she found when spirit overruled body. She's realistic about practical things--shoes, clothes, safe places (she had a heart-thumping encounter with a criminal scene). If you've dragged your feet (pun intended) on a walking program, get this book and get started renewing your health and communication with God.	2001-06-12
