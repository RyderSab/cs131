If you did not think that greed was an equation in this administration, read this book.	2004-02-03

The author is young and you have to applaud the success at having a book published - the essence of first love so well documented and his attempt to tell it backwards from an old man's point of view.  <br />This is not a book for everyone.

US	51228497	RB2KD9Z3UY6EA	0812579046	622668415	Others	Books	5	7	9	N	N	forceful and compelling	this book was scary.  the possibilities of what happens to deformed children who are not wanted or are left to die are examined in fiction by james herbert. scary, in your face and compelling, no thought is left undone. a man (who has intelligence) but is deformed in a physical sense has been reborn as such to redeem himself from a life before that was amoral and filled with depravity.  so our hero is put on this earth to redeem himself and make do with the scorn of &quot;normal&quot; people.  it is not easy to read this book and think of all the times we have judged the disabled as less than us. to take for granted in a physical sense what we have. in a very descriptive way by herbert, he articulates how the abuse is internalized. this is not a happy book. there are few brief moments of joy and love.  our hero finds a rest home that is the secret jail of others like him, who are worse off than him.  Of course he was put on earth for a purpose, for himself (the redemption) and for others (to save).   i do not agree that he writes (as the flap bragged) that he is like stephen king - who has a tendency to be more subtle and there with kings books there is always a conclusive ending. herbert wrote in his brief and last chapter that this was taken from actual and true events and that he hoped the reader was disturbed.  this is a thinking person's book - despite the fiction and horror of it all, you cannot finish reading it without giving a nod to the reality of what if and hope that there are people who are in position with presence of mind to use their powers appropriately.	2000-11-15

I cannot give this five stars because it reminded me too much of The Year of the Widow by John Irving.  maybe there was supposed to be something &quot;ironic&quot; about the title and the main character actually revising accounts - this is a old method that did not work, because this book was not tight, nor suspenseful.  It was drawn out with definitely not enough character development.	2000-10-12

The author is in touch with feelings and her characters are rich in dimension.  A Map of the World is a story about a woman, married with two kids &amp; her life on the farm.  Until one day everything falls apart beginning with the death of a child she was supposed to be babysitting.  The death is a catalyst and has a domino effect for the rest of the story, including the accusing of the woman of child abuse.  We read about the disintegration of her marriage, her husbands dependence on different women in varying degrees.  Her children, while initially were represented as overblown, become almost background music. I was fascinated by the shifts of tone,  and wondered what the author was thinking as she stripped layers of the characters until they became refined &amp; almost clean.  The book is about forgiveness and this becomes apparent especially at the end - judgement is suspended and you must analyze how things can get blown out of proportion depending on which side of the glass you are peering through.	2000-09-27

I use the word  &quot;attractive&quot; in lieu of compelling, as in, i was compelled to  continue reading the book because it was so good. This unfortunately was  not the case. We are reintroduced to Marino the detective and must read  through the closeness of the relationship, alluding to what they have been  through together.  Huh?  then there is the niece, who makes a brief and  angry appearance and to tell you the truth, i could not figure that out and  neither could the author. A scheming police chief, a scheming co-worker and  a body found in an ocean crate lead us to paris (on the concorde no less).  Oh and then we get to read about the heart wrenching angst of losing a  loved one.  This was an attempt maybe? to branch out. However, there was no  character development.  There is nothing to like about the main character,  who seems to vacillate between worlds.  The surrounding characters we are  supposed to have some following of.  Go back to Lawrence Sanders who could  continue with the same detective, but was not too into repeating himself.  It is like watching a sequel and having to endure the parts we saw from the  first movie.  Not ingenous.	2000-09-13

A man who goes a  little nuts and begins a cult, the detective who comes to the scene of the  crime, the daughter of the nutty man who is nutty herself.  Most of the  books are written so subtly that the nuances - are like real life.  it is  what i most appreciate about the writing.  There is no struggling, even if  shifting scenarios or subject matter to figure out &quot;where am i now and  how the heck did i get here&quot;. The story of the cult seemed initially  farfetched, then i began to see a point, about being taught only one thing  and one way and how narrow the focus on the world can be, as well as  suspicious.  I am not sure if this was intentional or not, but it was an  interesting thought.  the book was enjoyable and as always when reading the  kellerman novels (by Jonathan too) do not feel cheated.	2000-09-13

She has this incredible imagination, the ability to develop characters that are all too human.  So you can take a page out of her book and apply it to yourself or someone you know (she is  one hell of a writer).  The main character, is a woman who is out of touch  with herself, driven, but still compassionate.  We take a trip with her,  through the past and to the present, with relatives, friends, parents and  finally home.  I don't want to divulge too much, suffice it to say that  Fannie Flagg is an american treasure.  She captures what our culture is  doing today and creates a story of a woman who with a lot of struggle and  courage, does find herself.	2000-02-05

The introduction of a cult-like  religion was a twist. This book was so well written, planned out, it had  you rooting for Mark Beamon (along with a cast of characters that were  irritating, frightening and endearing).  There were so many surprises and  the premise of our privacy being invaded by a group of people with a  different agenda was definitely not a far fetched idea.	2000-02-05

This is an excellent one about a woman who has reconciliation to do with her family.  She encounters a man, who has had his share of pain and his daughter (who hopefully we will see in  another book by Luanne Rice).  It is true that the poignancy of the story  can bring out the kleenex, but the writing was superlative, describing a  thanksgiving scene that made you appreciate your family more than ever.

He is able to delve into the hidden fears, phobias and manipulate his characters with accurate portrayal of &quot;that other&quot; lurking beneath the surface.  However, this book  concentrated too much on the fear itself so that the fear became unscary  and tiresome.  A husband and wife are brainwashed, a mad scientist is  responsible, a few heroes are thrown our way.  His best book was River of  Darkness - in fact i believe it to be a classic.

The  nuances, the chest thrusting, the sense that as a man in his prime (no  matter what age) as a rooster, he will crow and loudly.
