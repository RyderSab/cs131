I know it says there are 23 stories, so I should haev been better prepared for short stories...only some of them were only like 5 pages long, and on top of that, they were just plain stupid.  I think this was a waste and I know I will not buy any moer books that have large groupings of stories in them.  Hey, I like a good hot juicy sex scene as much as the next person, but i think i would prefer  a little more depth of the story than what you get with this group of stories. Some of the stories in here would have you going &quot;huh?&quot; after you read it.  What else can you say...	2001-03-26

I know all of you fellow Susan Elizabeth Phillips fans are gonna secretly wonder if it will be worth the extra bucks you'll have to fork over to get a copy of this hard to find out of print book.  I will tell you, it really is.  Dont let the thought that this is her first book deter you either.  She must have been writing in the womb!  Her newest novel, THIS HEART OF MINE, is just as good.  If you read all her books in chronilogical order, some will be even more enjoyable since she will branch off sometimes and give prior characters their own stories.  Get a copy of this if you can, then check out Amazon's other choices for her and buy every one you can, you will re-read every one several times if you love deep, penetrating writing like only SEP can deliver!	2001-02-26

This novel is one of the few that I have done that with.  It is a mix between a &quot;ugly duckling&quot; and &quot;cinderella&quot; story.   Girl is quiet and reserved, boy is wild,girls are warned to stay away from him.  Boy takes his bad reputation and leaves to make a new life in another city.  Ten years later she calls him back to town to participate in a dating game as the celebrity guest.  He says he'll only come if she's one of the 3 female contestants he has to choose from.  She begrudgingly agrees, and bam!  He sees her as a grown &quot;fully matured&quot; woman for first time in ten years.  This book gives a lot of sexual tension, which I find necesary for the characters to mesh, and keeps your attention all the way thru the story. Read it, Im sure you'll agree.	2001-02-26

But low and behold, she just gets deeper and deeper.  I laughed and I cried BIG buckets, and the tears  are well worth the the time and effort to read this book!<br />I couldn't  believe how strongly emotional I became involved in this story.  One thing  I have learned since this intro into SEP's works is that all of her books  will make you feel the same rollercoaster of emotions that this one  inspires.<br />I know I haven't given much detail as to this particular story,  but trust me, If I got started I dont think I would be able to sum up what  I would say without giving too much away.<br />Francesca and Dallie have one  of the rockiest relationships that end up as one of the most endearing  couples I can remember.   Be sure to read &quot;Lady Be Good&quot; after  this one.  It picks up with two new characters that lead off from Dallie  and Francesca's story.  <br />MS.

It talks about Georgeanne's learning problems, and John's  first wifes suicide and what it takes for people to rise above their  insecurities and mistakes.<br />You may read a lot of reviews that promise  that this book or that book was the best they ever read.

I found myself saying, &quot;Enough  Already&quot;!  I wouldnt waste my time on this book.

The characters in this book, from Harley to the baby sister Jody, are so deeply described that I felt like I knew each of them.  Harley, the main character, is responsible for his sisters since his mother was sentenced to  life in prison for killing his father.<br />Harley has the most intriguing wit  and intelligence and doesn't even realize just how smart he is.  He deals  with his responsibility like a grown man.  It takes the reader awile to  actually dawn on the fact that he takes his responsibilities of his sisters  without question and does a remarkable job.  <br />Even though one sister is  promiscuous, one is obsessed with her dead father, and one is constantly  making her lists and praying for her elders &quot;sowls&quot;.  He does the  best he can.<br />The love affair that Harley has with his neighbor is  adulterous, but when you focus on just the two people coming together, it's  hard to look down on them because they do so because of their overwhelming  need to feel loved.  <br />I was surprised by the ending of this book.  I wont  say what it is cause Id be stupid to let the cat outta the bag!  But I  sincerely hope that Ms. O'dell will do a continuation on this book and  follow through with all the characters to see how their lives progress say  ten to fifteen years down the road.  In my mind I find myself writing maybe  what could be with them and how they have progressed and developed.  <br />On  a scale of one to ten I give this book a twenty!

But I sure hope some of you who are comparing how her other books' rank will not only notice the good reviews for this, but buy it.  It truly is one of the sexiest love stories you'll ever find.<br />Nick's character is so well described that I can see him clearly in my mind.  Good Lord, what a hottie!

Of course im always for a good sensual  spark, and the way the they found each other and relearned each other was  nicely written.  Being from the south i automatically have a liking for  southern relationships in a story, but the redneck thing was a little gaudy  for my taste.

It is the shortest of the many Lavryle novels i have read but it still has the same endearing quality of all her sassy and sexy stories.  One thing I  liked was the way both characters were both into being physically fit and  how it was known how bold and strong the female lead is in this story. She  doesnt have to be a bed of roses to be sexy and to make him happy.  I have  read almost all of Lavyrle's books and this was a nice addition to the  rest.  You'll enjoy this book!	2000-04-05

Separate Beds being my all time favorite book.  This story only got better the deeper into the book you got.  The way the characters respond to their feelings seems less contrived than a lot of the  typical romances you will read.  The closer you get to the finale, the  better it gets!  It has a suspense that reams you deeper into the story.  A  must read for anyone who loves a good story and likes to ride the wave of  emotions only Lavyrle can put you on. READ IT !	2000-04-05

I have read one other title from her and I am now addicted to her work.  Her writing flows and has an energy that makes you laugh and cry at the same time.  I will  now buy anything I can find of hers.  If you wanna read a sassy story that  has chin dropping romance, read this book!	2000-02-27

If you are looking for a book that you cant put down, look no further!  The story puts you on a rollercoaster of emotions, from joy to outrage and everything in between!   I have now read several of her books and this one still remains my  favorite.  Catherine and Clay make you feel as though you know them  persoanlly and make you feel you have a stake in what is happening.   Superbly written so that you will not be able to put it down!	2000-02-02
