So a thought occured:  &quot;Why not mix the two?&quot;  It is this revelation that would change both his career, (which was never what it should have been, or is now) and what we think of as a science fiction novel.<br />  The book itself is a maze of self-doubt, which is apparent in all of Dick's better novels.  Ragle Gumm, believing he lives in 1958 (When the book was written) watches as the town disintigrates, including a soft drink stand that turns into a piece of paper reading &quot;soft drink stand.&quot;  The book is slow at first, but picks up fast.  Unfortunately, after a cool sequence that predates &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;, it disintigrates into a political sci-fi mess.  But don't let that distract you:  This novel is as terrific as it is influential.	1997-07-30

Camus gives us a taste of bubonic plague in a shipping town and then shows how the city reacts.  We have interesting insights into the doctors, the politicians, the criminal element who smuggle well people out before they can get the plague, and the bourgeouis reaction.  Camus sets it up in  a style that to me seems rather reminiscent of Kafka's _The Castle_ where you're never completely sure of what's going on.<br /><br />If the novel has a failing, it is in the characters.  Few of them really come to life, rather seeming manipulated by their situations.  Still, it's a novel that will keep you thinking, and deserves its classic status.	1997-07-25

Indeed, the manuscript was in the very car he crashed, and was held up by his family for all these years.  The wait, in this case, has been worth it, and the most frustrating thing about the novel is that he wasn't able to finish his tale.  But Camus fans be forewarned: He was onto something very different here from _The Stranger_ or _The Plague_.<br />    What _The First Man_ does is give you insight into the author.  Unlike Celine's autobios, Camus chooses a wispy, dreamlike approach to his characters and life.  Thus, you feel close to these characters, but still in the distance, seeing in as though through a cloud.  Do yourself a favor, though.  Take a peak at Camus' swan song, and feel the loss as we all must at his passing.	1997-07-24

Here, towards the end of his life, he finally seemed to be sifting his philosophies from his characters; making real people turn up in unrealistic situations, hence making a point about either that character or society.  What results is very strong fiction, be it the adultress in the desert, the teacher who cannot ignore a revolution, the artist locked up in his loft trying to find the perfect idea, or the islanders who must carry a stone to show their faith.  Camus is blunt about what he feels are our shortcomings; but he lets his characters make their mistakes as people.  Thus, years later, you find yourself still pondering these stories and seeing them reflected in the world around you.  Profound, and uplifting in their own downbeat way.  Considering that the novel he never finished, the recently published _The First Man_ is autobiography, it seems Camus felt he had said what he came to say about existentialism and society	1997-07-24

Here we find the crazy Takashi and quiet, morbid Mitsu, both of whom are consciously obsessed with replaying the roles of their ancestors in a small town uprising of over a hundred years ago.  This time it is to rise up against a Korean &quot;Emperor of the Supermarkets&quot; who is tearing the valley farmers away from their past with a Wal-Mart style goods store.  The book deals well both with the positive and negative effects of history and why people want so badly to immerse themselves in legends rather than face the truth around them. <br />  As with all of Oe's books, this is a depressing excursion.

Here we find more auto-bio text, this time concerning Celine's childhood, but as with &quot;Journey&quot; it is assumable that much of this was symbolic.  Celine's descriptions of his family, his schooling, his brief career in jewelry sales, and his appreticeship for a mad genius are all so eloquently written as to bring tears.

Of course, the fact that it was a best-seller is entirely ironic; there is nothing about this book that is conventional. <br />  What the book consists of is a personal, semi-autobiographical journey into the life of a Paris doctor for the poor and his adventures in WWI, in Africa, working for General Motors in America, and finally for a sanitorium in France.  In each instance, the culture de jour is analyzed, reconfigured, and often trashed.  Celine says what he means...  And if these dots mean anything to you...  You'll know you're hooked, too!...

It helps if you approach the book not so much as a novel, per se, than as a gastronomical imagination explosion.  An Explanation? <br />  Like Burroughs, Leyner doesn't write stories, although the book is seperated into &quot;Sections&quot;.  Rather, he chooses to take insane topics, (like the Military Academy of Beauty, a man named Big Squirrel shooting his first, beautiful ape woman, kidney stone removal with Jimi Hendrix guitar solos, etc.) and create an arsenal with it.  Admittedly, this means you will either love it, or hate it.  If you don't like it, leave it alone.  The rest of us will blow cold cereal out our nostrils while howling with laughter.

Critics embraced the former, but what was Leyner going to do for an encore.... Whoo boy.  <br />  What he did was write a 1000 mph masterpiece about a megalomaniac author named Mark Leyner who wrote a masterpiece called &quot;My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist&quot;, steals Lincoln's Morning Breath, performs his own internal organ surgeries, gets a set of bodygaurds who fulfill his every paranoic whim, and is sentenced to having one item permanently removed from his household every month by the FBI.

Well, it doesn't work.  The &quot;Plot device&quot; is so weak it walks on thin ice-nine; an astronaut trapped in a time warp that throws him into the best moments of Vonnegut's books?

His able hand at believable character sketching would make this seem obvious.  But before the first line has even ended, it becomes obvious where Vonnegut is going: Pretention land.  Oh, sure, the play DOES right itself a bit in the second act.  But by then, who cares? The laughs a bound as the plot sweeps out of boundaries.  Vonnegut may have been a bit hard on the work in future years, rating it a dismal &quot;D-&quot; in &quot;Palm Sunday.&quot;  But it is one piece that might best be left out of print; it is one experiment that didn't work out	1997-07-06

But as the years went by, it became so popular around college campuses that students were willing to pay outrageous prices for what few copies could be found.  <br />  That's &quot;Sirens&quot; for you; here we find the first inklings of original madness from Vonnegut: Take a part in an interplanetary revolution,  get stranded on the inner surface of Mercury, or fly off to Titan to meet the infamous &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot; co-stars, the Tralfamadorians.  They make their first appearance here, as does much of Vonnegut's personal worldview, and his wonderfully black humor.  Where this book goes, the rest of his oevre have followed.  And though he wrote two slightly better books (&quot;Welcome to the Monkeyhouse&quot;, which is admittedly just a short story compedium, and the aforementioned &quot;Slaughterhouse&quot;) he would never be quite this outrageous again.	1997-07-06

By the time he wrote his next book, the cult-fave &quot;Sirens of Titan&quot;, he was a writer interested in science.  The transition is contained between these pages; obviously very influenced by Orwell and showing a society turning itself over to technology.  The Frankentstein-comparisons and government-as-fascism schemes are hardly original, but his use of humor is already evident and his characters already rich and full of ideas.  Don't overlook this terrific novel, a sort of seperate universe from the rest of Vonnegut's nadir.

So here we have the first of what has become a bit of an obsession for Vonnegut: the autobiographical  collage.  This version is a bit better than the later entries, though, since it puts more emphasis on worldview-articles and less on endless ramblings of Vonnegut history and &quot;what's on my mind today&quot; type of things.  Best of all is a trip to Burma during the revolution that ranks amongst the half a dozen best short pieces he's ever written.  By itself, that piece is worth the price of admission.  But with a few other good bits and pieces, this becomes a nice rest stop for Vonnegut fans, but little else.  Perhaps if Vonnegut would truly throw himself into these works, and write some gut-wrenching auto-bio, I would be more convinced.  But I always feel like he's holding back, and only putting out as much as he has to.  Try this, Kurt:  Re-read the Burma piece, and approach the rest of your life with the same passion	1997-07-06

Next to &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot;, this is easily the most necessary Vonnegut book to own.  Here, he sets free both his imagination AND his senses of humor and adventure to come up with some of the best short works published in this century.  Just look at this list:  &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot;, &quot;Thomas Edison's Dog&quot;, a truly hysterical piece on assisted suicide and a truly suspenceful piece on a game of chess played with real people. Most of these styles have since, of course,been copied to death.  But has anyone really cut as deep or as precisely into the public consciousness as did Vonnegut here?  One wishes he would have continued writing short stories, at least occasionally, and we could have more collections as diverse, entertaining, and thought provoking as this is.

Though caught up in a family struggle of money and power, Rosewater himself wants nothing more than to read the science fiction novels of Kilgore Trout and be a volunteer fireman.  Here, Vonnegut uses his great skill of detailing characters to bring this tremendous, lovable character to life.  In the background, of course, are the usual life-problems which bring a tinge of dark humor and a sometimes muddling subplot about Rosewater's money which surround him in his life.

Where he fails is in his heavy-handed dealing with bums and the mis-characterization of one Kilgore Trout (his most popular character, drastically miscast as a conman in prison).  A fine book full of funny and poignant moments, &quot;Jailbird&quot; unfortunately remains one of Vonnegut's lesser novels, and a contributer to the great glut that he fell into at the end of the '70's	1997-07-03

There is also another story about a used car salesman losing his mind and wreaking havoc on the good times.  <br />  Of course, the novel is probably most famous for a character that comes in late in the novel, one Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.  Here, Vonnegut does his best Pirendello and confronts his world head on.

Not to say that &quot;Sirens of Titan&quot; wasn't fantastic; it is probably, in the end, the better book.  But here Vonnegut went beyond his substantial imagination to begin to broach two subjects which have haunted him throughout the rest of his career:  the horrors of war and the fakeness of most people.  Here, his hero spends time as an German immigrant spying for America by reading Nazi propaganda over the radio.  His pre-inserted stutters and coughs are really secret messages, but nobody knows that.  Indeed, after the war he finds himself a fugitive, and the book asks us to decide which is more important:  His helping the Americans or making the Nazis believe in their cause.  A fascinating book with lots of surprises, it began a cycle for Vonnegut which would combine harsh reality with an other-wordly imagination, all topped off with black humor.

Outside of an interesting time with the ghost of Kilgore Trout, Vonnegut bores us with more island revolution, (ala &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot;) and a conceited de-evolution theme about humans digressing over a million years into seals.  A tremendous letdown which suggests that Vonnegut needs to look for something, ANYTHING that doesn't have to do with &quot;man is bad, andhe'll suffer for it, by God.&quot;  He's said it all before, and a whole lot better than this	1997-07-03

And it does a fine job of that.

A dark comedy involving one Rudy Waltz who accidentally shoots a pregnant woman, killing her and her child, when he points his gun out his window and fires for the sake of it.  The book deals with one wild thing after another, and pokes fun at the darker side of nuclear bombs, Hitler's art, gourmet cooking, and public atrocity exhibitions of prisoners.

Following in the footsteps of Joyce and Faulkner, Amis flows his words like an elixir through the passages of this book.  His characters breathe life believably; you both despise and root for all the main characters.  But where Joyce had Dublin and Faulkner the south, Amis lays claim to Bitterness.  Even his when they win, his characters can never succeed.  His central character, a literary author, has written a book that nobody can read without getting a brain hemmorage.  His friend and feel-good author writes vapid fluff and sells millions.  The literary author wants to kill off the popular author.  The popular author, though, is jealous of his inability to defeat the literary author in any game.

But what neither he nor Vonnegut (at least lately) seem to be able to do is stay cohesive.  The book seems to flow from one slightly-related incident to another, but never really figures out a way to tie them all togeother without seeming contrived.  Another problem is the characters themselves.  For the first hundred pages or so, their multi-dimensional neurosis and obsessions (the bit about the central character teaching Hitler Studies is classic) are poignant and hilarious.  But after awhile they seem one dimensional; you keep waiting for some new development that isn't simply an overblown reaction to one of their paranoias.  Still, all this criticism is mild:  &quot;White Noise&quot; seems destined to last as one of the great parodies	1997-06-24

Fortunately, this is Richard Brautigan, and his wallpaper is like none you've ever seen.  He wanders around, noting mostly sad scenes about the world around him, (like the one about his favorite chinese restaurant.  He writes with such pathos that you feel sad and angry when it closes) though this world view can be compared to his mindset at the time; Brautigan took his own life just a few years later.  For Brautigan fans, this will provide necessary insight into a normally distant personality.  For everybody else, it will grow very tedious after awhile.  Interesting idea, but the very concept wears thin quickly	1997-06-20

But one of those things was definitely reflection.  Here, he leaves behind his tradional creative bursts and settles in for a lush, almost southern-gothic-like novel.  But it is the nostalgia tainted by a cruel and adult world.  As a reader, you feel blown through the small town landscapes Brautigan gusts at you.  But when you realize where he was headed, the symbolism of the central (child) character with the gun is bone-chilling.  Had Brautigan recovered, and continued in this style, he would have had a whole new lease on writing.  As it is, we have one example; and that one example is astonishing	1997-06-20

He plays a very similar role in this book as that one; in both places he is a semi-autistic outcast who obsesses over religion (in &quot;Androids&quot;) and the out-of-the-ordinary.  The differences are:1. &quot;Crap Artist,&quot; though not released until 1975, was written in 1959, nine years before &quot;Androids&quot; and 2. This is not a science fiction novel, per se.  <br />  Indeed, here we see Dick writing about the obsessions and personality disorders of the every-day man.  He writes it in Faulkner-fashion; letting his characters trade off first person accounts.  Jack is only one of them.  The tale of spouse abuse, UFO-worshipping, deception, and modern convenience is brilliant.  Had Dick refined a few of the early chapters, it would have been perfect.

Much of what is here is good for laughs.  The title piece, especially, is well-written and poignant.  But too much of the book wanders about with no point.

It is easily a &quot;10&quot; in either category.  But the book, (which was rejected by publishers for years before it became a runaway sensation) is in actuality a kind of hodge-podge of inventive mind games; all of which revolve either around actual trout fishing, or people named things like &quot;Trout Fishing in America Shorty.&quot;  Not a real novel in the traditional sense, it is more a collection of short stories based on a theme.  Some of these are hilarious, thought provoking, or steeped in emotional remembrance, (The &quot;Kool Aid Addict&quot; probably being my personal favorite). But far too much of the book is simply inventive rambling, which ceases to be interesting after awhile.  Check it out, though, as its importance easily outweighs its noodling	1997-06-18

Certainly, it holds up well under scrutiny; it is far easier to understand than most of his &quot;imaginative ramblings,&quot; but still contains that child-like sense which makes his books so refreshing.  It is basically a portrait of a lost weekend with a friend in the woods.  But not just ANY lost weekend.  Sure, there are plenty odd events which occur, but I guarantee you that what will stay in your mind is the personal description of the central character, who's great-grandfather was (supposedly) the only confederate general from California.  The only criticism, really, are a few slow spaces and a rather contrived ending.  But the book is a perfect introduction to Brautigan, and feels still as close as a long lost friend	1997-06-18

But his chief problem has always been consistency; some of his novels are passionate and creative, others feel like writing exercises. As you can probably tell, this is one of the latter.  Here, Brautigan stumbles his two characters through a bizarre mad scientist plot which features a set of sisters who's identities are constantly changing, and who offer never-ending sexual fantasies.  Right.  Do yourself a favor.  Blow off this one, and pick up &quot;In Watermelon Sugar,&quot; or almost any other Brautigan title.  Profoundly disappointing	1997-06-18

In it, we encounter a blundering private eye who discovers a dead body in his apartment.  As he sets out to solve this mystery, we discover he has a problem with &quot;dreaming of Babylon,&quot; which is a sort of daydream-as-narcoleptic state.  Fun, without a doubt.

Coming as it did after a few throwaways, (&quot;The Hawkline Monster&quot; and &quot;Willard and His Bowling Trophies&quot;) people had Brautigan written off and this attracted no new readers to its insanity.  Which is a shame.  The story itself is split into two sides.  One revolves around a Sombrero which falls from the sky and the ensuing argument over who, EXACTLY, is going to pick it up.  This results in the National Guard being called out and all sorts of nonsense.  This is fun stuff, but it's the other story, of Brautigan's pining over his lost relationship with a Japanese woman, that stands as one of his very best.  Do not pass this book up, if you can find it! A truly unique vision	1997-06-17

In it, we contrast the stories of a couple's sad and strange sexual activities with the search of several brothers for their stolen bowling trophies, which happen to be located in the apartment next to the central couple. The brothers have made a pact to violently kill whoever has stolen their precious trophies. The bowling trophies are looked over by a stuffed bird named Willard, were obviously very precious to these brothers, and that's about all we know about them. <br />  The book, like &quot;The Hawkline Monster&quot; and &quot;Dreaming of Babylon&quot; seems to be less a passionate frenzy of creative artillery, (like the vastly superior &quot;In Watermelon Sugar&quot;) than a writing exercise for Brautigan's ingenius imagination.  At times, some real feeling comes through with the couple and their unfortunate past.  But mostly, the book seems on hallucinatory autopilot.	1997-06-17

The book tells the story of a librarian for a library that stocks only books that have never been published, and will never be read.  It gives the character satisfaction to stock these books by people who want their one chance to be a writer.  Intertwined with this is the story of that same librarian's trip to Mexico for the procedure that is the book's title.  In contrast to the humor of the first part of the book, this section is morose, and descriptive.  It wraps you in the feelings of the protagonists. <br />  If there is criticism, then, it is that the writing speeds up and slows down periodically.  Thus, several chapters may go by with little happening, and then all hell breaks loose.  But this is a minor critique; and the reader can always know that the book WILL pick up pace.  A definite must for Brautigan fans.	1997-06-17

In it, we find 9 examples filled with characters and scenes that feel at times as if from a fairy tale; at other moments like a shot of realism.  Rushdie understands the people of India and Pakistan as Joyce understood Dubliners and Faulkner the people of Mississipi.  You feel after a time as though you know them personally.  And no, the book is not one focused vision, (like &quot;Shame&quot; or the infamous &quot;Satanic Verses&quot;) but rather like Joyce's aforementioned journey into the heart of Dublin.  It's a wide cast of characters and an interesting chain of events.  Perfect for a fast, invigorating read	1997-06-16

Indeed, I felt throughout almost like a voyeur into Oe's soul; as if I was walking with him through his own personal valley of death, and could only observe.  The text of the book is extremely depressing, and there are few upbeat moments throughout.  Bird, (the &quot;hero&quot;) has a child with a brain hemmorage, and must decide what to do.  You walk with him through drunken stupors, bizarre sex addictions, the pressure of family, and finally the decision point.  Bird initially tells the hospital to kill the baby by watering down it's milk.  When the baby only seems to get stronger, the book raises it's intensity even higher.  The first and final chapters include some of the most remarkable post-Faulkner writing I have ever encountered.  But be warned: it is not a journey for the weak of heart	1997-06-13

One, a sardonic, existentialist musing, finds a man lying in bed reliving his childhood under his fanatical, revolutionary father.  He himself feels helpless to deal with reality, and has hidden himself behind goggles.  Maybe he is ill, maybe not. Most readers will find the story as difficult a read as the &quot;Ben&quot; sequence of Faulkner's &quot;the Sound and the Fury,&quot; and twice as strange. Another deals with the relationship between a boy and a black prisoner in WWII-era Japan, and reminds me a bit of &quot;Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids.&quot;  The very best, though, deals with a character representative of Oe himself, and his relationship over Pepsi and Noodle soup with his retarded child.

Easily 99.9% of the population will not be able to deal with this book, both for moral and comprehendable reasons.  If you have read and enjoyed other Burrough's novels, you'll get a kick out of this one:  lots of Nova Mob intrigue, some truly funny industry parodies, and lots of familiar faces (Kiki, et al).  But if you've found Burroughs difficult, or if you're easily offended by graphic homosexual goings-on, you should steer far away from this one.  My personal rating is not so much against other literature, but against other Burroughs.  Stacked next to them, I feel this is a good one.  Very fast paced, and usually on target.

Without digressing itself into politics, the book strives to present situations and characters as they were.  The story revolves around a group of reform school boys left as captives in a village where a plague is taking over.  It addresses innocence, love, prejudism, betrayal, and what it is to be misunderstood when the world around you is falling to pieces.  Without question, one of Oe's best, though not recommended for those who like happy endings.  A dark, poetic experience that will refuse to leave you alone	1997-06-12

What's missing is the point.  Where before Leyner tapped into ideas that nobody would have thought seriously about,  (Does the title, &quot;My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist&quot; tell you anything?) here he is content to repeat himself.  Whole sections of the book are devoted to the kind of megalomania &quot;Et Tu&quot; pulled off so brilliantly.  Here it falls flat, and makes you seriously wonder about Leyner's state of mind.  I understand he's at work on a new &quot;novel,&quot; (this is a series of short works, like &quot;My Cousin&quot;) and perhaps he's saving his energy for that.  Still, some definite good times.

Just over one hundred pages long, the book drops you into the High Society world of Clara, who has married four times and is still fond of her first love, who gave her an emerald ring.  She gets her strength from this ring, which  she loses once, but then recovers, only to have it stolen.  Unfortunately, it takes 60 pages to get to the theft, and that first section is little more than monotonous pining over how bad life is for Clara, whom you never feel much for, anyway.  But the theft introduces you further to the nanny, Gina, who is a brilliant character.  Whenever Bellow concentrates on her deep and interesting problems, the book picks up pace.  The final confrontation between Gina and Clara, (Clara believes that Gina's boyfriend, Frederic stole the ring) is so good it makes you wonder just what Bellow could have done if he'd applied this kind of passion to the rest of the book.  Not bad, but really for Bellow-collectors only	1997-06-11

This, Dick's most famous book, is definitely NOT what you think it is going to be if you are picking it up after seeing the movie.  In fact, even if you have never heard of the movie, it is probably not what you are thinking it is going to be.  The book is a maze of questions and theories; especially exploring the familiar Dickian theme of identity.  (am I real, or manufactured?  Are my memories real, or programmed?  Are YOU real?) The story of the replicant (androids who mirror humans and often exceed them, but have a very short lifespan) hunter Deckard is fast, often funny (see the mood machine in the first chapter) and always intriguing.  He seems to have rushed his writing in a few places.  And at times I could tell he was keeping his concept down for the enjoyment of sci-fi readers.

Written in Faulkner-esque style, (letting several characters narrate the book in first person) the book tells the story of what happened in America after we LOST WW II.  What makes it great is how it shows the simple things:  People believe, for instance, that if the Jews hadn't been exterminated, they would have taken over.  Blacks and non-aryans are seen as non-humans.  Into this world comes a book that asks them the question, &quot;What if Germany and Japan had LOST the war?&quot;  Reality bends into itself.  The characters fill you with their personalities, and the suspence mounts constantly. Without question one of the finest books in the latter half of the twentieth century	1997-06-10

Indeed, this was obviously written for his newfound audience as one finds no traces of the sexual/violent extremes some of his earlier work embraces.  What he does embrace is the character of one Dr. Mallory, and the river he inadvertenly &quot;invents.&quot;  Mallory is a mercurial ride in narrator fashion, though you never get much further than his obsession with the river.  This, in fact, is the problem with the entirety of the book.  Everyone, including the river itself, is given a complex single-faceted personality (make sense?) and what this inevitably leaves the reader with is a spark of intrigue, but never a feeling of real involvement.  That greatly hurts an adventure work, such as this one, where Ballard doesn't have his tremendous imagination to fall back on.

BOSWELL is Elkin's first book and remains extremely insightful even after thirty years.  It is the story of a &quot;bum&quot; who dedicates his life to knowing celebrities.  These range from a south american dictator to an Italian princess to a nobel prize winning scientist (for whom Boswell sabotages a multi-million dollar grant by claiming the grant giver called him &quot;a little yid.&quot;).  Key amongst his contacts is his very skillful lying and his eventual self-destruction of whatever relationship he may form with them.  To him, it is more important that he know them and all their eccentricities, (which he keeps notecards on) than to be truly intimate with them.  In fact, you could say that Boswell is not intimate with anybody, and that losing for him is half the fun.  If there is any criticism I would give this book, it is that it tends to switch scenes, (many of which are ficticious &quot;journal entries&quot;) without enough warning or understanding of what events are taking place.
