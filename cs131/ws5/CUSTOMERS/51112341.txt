There are letters that were written in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, as well as memoirs written in the years that followed.  Oral histories are  transcribed, so that you \\"hear\\" the voices of those that went through the storm and the recovery efforts.  Many of the sources were collected from the Rosenberg Library in Galveston.  The letters and the memoirs are reproduced in their original form, which only adds to the pure authenticity of the horror and despair of  the residents of Galveston.<br />The book begins with excerpts from a daily journal kept by Isaac Cline who was the U.S. Weather Bureau meteorologist in atime when meteorology and it's vital importance was in it's infancy.  What follows are horrifying accounts of the total destruction of what had been a city in the midst of an economic boom, the 3rd richest city in proportion to it's population, a railroad center, a banking center, and  a huge exporter of cotton, wheat, cattle and corn.  As the economy boomed, the citizens of Galveston turned away from the possibility of a major hurricane striking them.<br />When the hurricane did strike Galveston, the city was nearly wiped clean.  Estimates of the dead start conservatively at 6000 and as high as 12000.  Marshall law was declared in order to quell the looting and other forms of civil disobedience that occured.  Rumors ran rampant in the streets after the storm creating fear and panic to a decimated population.  The death toll was so immense that bodies of the deceased were brought to the beach in any form of conveyance available and stacked in piles.  Seeking the  missing family members and friends was a hideous labor.  Insurmountable  odds faced those that searched the stacks of the dead.<br />As recovery efforts progressed it was realized by all that a complete reorganization of the local government was critical to the future of Galveston.  The new government that was chosen  streamlined  the decision making process and it also provided clearly defined lines of responsibility.  while Galveston did rebuild both physically and financially, it took careful planning and a realistic look at it's future.<br />There are over 70 photographs showing the aftermath of this catastrophic storm and the destruction wrought upon Galveston.<br />This book adds a clear and vivid account of the lives of those that survived this storm. This is a remarkable book that brings us a look at the human spirit of people whose lives are forever impacted by disaster and yet manage to continue on despite the hardships and vast loses.tical to the future of Galveston.

The story centers on the life of a woman, Tessa, who is involved in relief work among the real people of Africa and discovers that these same people whom she has grown to love and admire are being used as guinea pigs in order to make big profits for a pharmaceutical company and those in it's employ. Tessa begins to gather information to prove what she suspects. She is joined in this pursuit by an African doctor, Arnold Bluhm, who is as dedicated to her cause as is Tessa. Tessa is married to Justin Quayle, a member of the British diplomatic corps, and keeps what she is involved in secret from Justin so as not to put him and his career at risk. What happens next is the horrible murder of Tessa, and the dissapearance of Dr. Bluhm whose company she had been in. The question of who murdered Tessa poses many possibilities. Her husband, Justin, a mild-mannered British gentleman gardener, is compelled to delve into Tessa's secret life and decipher the clues and information left behind in order to discover his beloved wife's mission. This is an amazing interpretation of Africa, very vivid and full of life and noise. While it is a novel pitting big money business against the everyday common person, there is nothing common about the characters involved or the situations that develop. It portrays the depths to which even the meek and mild mannered can reach out and gather their strength when the cause is truth and justice and love.	2005-09-22

The young man's death is a turning point for Reesa McMahon because the ugly world of racism is unveiled before her young eyes.  Marvin Cully's family and Reesa's families are friends, and Marvin's death draws them even closer.  Reesa's parents must make decisions to do what is right, even at the risk of endangering their own family.<br /><br />The early Civil Rights movement is explored, with the founder Harry T. Moore joining the  McMahon's and the Cully's in trying to expose and bring to justice those responsible for Marvin's murder.  This opens the window on the KKK and more violence and terror is unleashed.<br /><br />This is a story that is both beautiful and heart-wrenching.  It is a story about friends, faith  and families that make definitive choices to do the right thing.  It is also about innocence lost when wrong and right collide, leaving  moral courage stamped in fire upon a young girl's soul.<br /><br />I met the author at a book event in Tampa.  She spoke about the historical accuracy of her book and told of her decision to write this book based on her father's actions in that time.  Also at this event was Evangeline Moore, the daughter of Harry Moore, and she told of her view of events of the time and of her parents violent murder.<br /><br />This is an amazing book that is an honest and insightful view into the thoughts and lives of those in the early days of the Civil Rights Movement and a foresight of changes that were to come.	2005-05-03

Killer 'cane  is a well researched book about the 1928 hurricane that swept through the Caribbean and the Bahamas as a category 5 and then hit the Florida coast around Palm Beach.<br /><br />The research includes 20  original interviews of individuals by the author and several interviews done by others, as well as numerous documents, books, articles and pamphlets.<br /><br />The lack of forecasting knowledge, the limited understanding of the potential danger and the desire to not frighten people ( tourists and land investors) all combined with the sheer power of an approaching category 5 hurricane  to create unimaginable devastation and destruction.<br /><br />Robert Mykle gives the history of the Lake Okeechobee area, explaining the richness of the land, the potential for farming as well as the hardships faced. The creation of the wall to hold back the water seemed so right at the time.  Mykle puts the human face on the disaster by introducing the families that lived and struggled with life on the edge of the Everglades, the farmers, the entrepreneurs, the migrant workers. We see and get a taste of their hopes and dreams, and then we see it all wiped clean.<br /><br />Mykle also includes enough meteorology facts for a basic understanding of hurricane formation and motion.<br /><br />Forecasting has come so far and yet there is still so much that can change, unpredictably, in the blink of an eye, that this is an important book to read to remind us of the pure power that a hurricane can unleash on us.<br /><br />After having been through Fran, Bonnie, Floyd, Dennis (in NC) Isabel (in VA) and Charlie & Frances (in FL) and currently watching the approach of IVAN I think it is important to not grow complacent and to be able to put a human face on the destruction a hurricane leaves in it's wake.	2004-09-12

EVENTIDE is the story of several families that give the word dysfunctional a brand new definition. (This is a much sadder book than PLAINSONG.)  In this novel several fammilies in a small town face unrelenting hardtimes and truly have their backs  up against the wall.  Not all the families  cope  with the situations that face them.  Some make the worst decisions possible leading to more pain and suffering.  For others it is a hard scramble just to keep their head above the proverbial water.  One of the bright spots of this novel is Rose, she is interesting , real and an absolute delight.  Raymond MacPheron however is the shining star of this novel, his grittiness, his integrity and his desire to lead a meaningful life give this novel it's inner light.

Mitch Albom has written a novel that is impossible to stop reading once you start.  He dares to answer the question that so many people ponder, what is the purpose of life?<br />In this novel an 83 year old gentleman dies and his life is explained to him by five people that he meets on his journey after his death.  They help him to understand what some of the critical points in his life were, who helped steer him along his true path and those whom he helped guide along their own path.  Mitch Albom shows us that some of the most important moments of our lives, are not the GREAT moments or the momentous  events, but they are the times when we sometimes unknowingly shape the life of another person and help them along their path.  It is in the small moments that the greatest beauty in life exists, the moments of pure love and an open heart, the moments when selfishness  vanishes and great things, although small occur.  It gives you pause to wonder who would be the five people that you would meet in heaven who would help you to understand the meaning of your life.	2004-06-03

The story revolves around Emil, the first born son of the leader of a nomadic family and how he learns to cope with the nightmare that Hitler created.  The daily life is beyond tortuous and yet people continue to struggle to survive.  As the nightmarish existence whittles away family and friends, Emil responds with a will to survive that is barely imaginable in the face of such horror.<br />Fires In The Dark is a story of tradition, family and hope.  It is also a story of man's inhumanity to man and the depths to which humanity can both sink and rise.  Most of all it is a story of the desire to survive above all odds.<br />Within this story the author reveals the lifestyle of the Roma,and although much is told there is so much more.<br />This is a fascinating look at a much ignored population and is both inspiring and horrifying.	2004-06-03

She was inspired to tell her story because she found offensive the common misconceptions about geisha that many people hold.  She felt the only way to clear up the false ideas and impressions was to open the doors on the world of geisha and shine a light on  her story, through her experience  and her thoughts.<br />Her story begins with her requesting to leave home at an early age to begin training with a Geisha at the age of five.  The training is at best difficult and demanding both mentally and physically, but the emotional toll seems extremely severe.  She perseveres through it all and her success is unprecedented. Her reflections on the demanding style of life lead her to a decision to retire at the age of 29 and to begin what she perceives to be a normal life.<br />The cultural differences are immense and at times difficult to comprehend.

James Lee Burke creates another dark mystery in the heat of the Louisiana swamps.  In this latest Dave Robicheaux tale, the death of a teenage driver turns into a series of twists and switchbacks that lead to a series of murders and cover-ups from decades ago through to the present. The story involves a hit man for the IRA, pornographic film stars, a former lover, blues musicians, along with a military hero using his past as a facade for who he really has become.  The layers of mystery are unwrapped slowly, each layer uncovered reveals new clues and new directions and new crimes to investigate for Dave and his podjo Clete.<br />I have two criticisms of this novel.  The first is that Robicheaux is dealing with a major loss in his life and we see that only in the aftermath, which feels like either a slight to the reader or an inability to deal with it by the author in a believable manner.  The second is that although I am aware of the authors political beliefs, they seem to predominate this novel like never before.  Even with these two situations, Burke comes through with an amazing puzzle of a novel.	2004-02-10

The motive is unfathomable, but then, they ARE serial killers.  While Jesse and his police force track the killers, not only the why, but the who will be next question hangs densely in the air.<br />While the investigation proceeds, Jesse becomes more or less involved with a couple of different women, when his ex-wife enters the picture.<br />In the center of this novel is the third line of the story involving a young girl who claims to have been raped by some of the jocks at her school.  The way Jesse handles this investigation is a wonderful new facet to this character.<br />The mix of emotions is nearly volatile, and as another murder occurs, you begin to wonder how will Robert PArker bring the story together.

This tale portrays the importance of friendship and family and the ability to discern what is truly important and what is merely desire.  I enjoyed this book far more than I thought I would, and after finishing it and thinking about it, I felt that it nudges you to examine your own life and the choices we all make.<br />The four women range in age from their twenties to early fifties. Their marital status, married, divorced, single and widowed, some have children, some do not.

Sara Backer has created an intricate plot that revolves around the death of an American student while studying abroad in Japan.  His father travels to a small Japanese town to find out the details of his son's death.  Things are revealed which do not match up and the father is thrown into an investigation to discover the facts surrounding this death.  The problems begin to mount when an American woman is pulled into the middle of the investigation against her better judgement.  The problems become even larger when the cultural differences come into play.<br />A difference in attitudes towards death, towards open expression of emotion and  individualism are so wide apart as to appear insurmountable.  The difference in the style of daily living, the cuisine and even the written language pose their own problems.<br />Sara Backer bases the novel on her experiences while she was a visiting professor at Shizuoka University.  The cultural differences are handled with both seriousness and humor to make for an interesting look at life as a foreigner in small town Japan.<br />American Fuji is also the story of a search for love, acceptance and understanding and what people are willing to trade to gain a firmer footing in these emotional  arenas.<br />I found the description of Mount Fuji wonderfully accurate, including the climb. The thoughts that arise are some of the same thoughts I had when I climbed it. It was both majestic and spiritual just as she writes, it was also a lot more difficult than it looked to be.<br />This was a great story told by a very talented author about love, life and a cultural gap that can not always be bridged.	2003-11-21

This is a wonderful story that gives insight  into Japanese culture.  Cathy N. Davidson opens her heart and soul to share  her experience of living in Japan in a University town.  She leaves behind the stereotypes and misconceptions about who the Japanese people are and what the Japanese are about.  The experience of being a gaijin, a foreigner, in Japan is a fascinating experience.  She uses her own personal experiences and friendships as the backdrop to develop an understanding of the differences that exist culturally and how she copes with the misunderstandings and indulgences that come together to create interpersonal relationships.  The interesting aspect in this situation is that  each side has a different perspective and the rules of engagement are not clear.  She handles the differences with understanding and an inquisitiveness that is open and honest in seeking out the similarities that are below the surface and the culturally ingrained realities that drive the Japanese.  The overworked and driven businessmen, the stressful educational system, childhood indulgence phenomenon, along with a difficult language and a written language that takes years to comprehend are all a part of the tale.<br />She also brings some deep personal insights into her own life into the story that make this book so much more than a travelogue!!<br />This book was a treasure for me to read after just returning from another trip to Tokyo and having experienced many similar situation and discussions.<br />Ms. Davidson's love and appreciation of a culture and country that is so different from her own shines through out her writing.  Her delight in new experiences, different ideas and her open, honest heart make this book a  discerning and perceptive  narrative.	2003-11-21

He wrote- &quot;When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me.  &quot;Look for the helpers.

Jone's novel, The Known World, is a story about the  social and  moral boundaries that were woven into the fabric of those living in Virginia in the time of slavery. The author creates a clear and insightful look into the lives of individuals whose lives were bound with the reality of slavery.  The focus of the story are black slave owners and black slaves. While many are familiar with this period of time and the issues involved, Edward P. Jones sheds new light on the issue of black slave owners.<br />The perspectives of the slave owners, the  slaves and as well as the freed blacks (those who accepted the fact of slavery and those who opposed it)  are all explored. The thoughts of white slave owners and the whites who did not own slaves are also an integral part of this book.<br />The story seemed to lack a fiery passion to it that I thought it would have.  I have  realised that this technique is a critical part of the style the author used to tell the story.  The lack of passion relays the feeling that these people had accepted their KNOWN WORLD, that slavery was a part of the fabric of their lives and was an acknowledged normal aspect of  life.  No matter who you were, you aspired to become a slaveowner because it signified that you were successful and deserving of respect.<br /> It begs the question, what in our own KNOWN WORLD do we accept that in years to come will be viewed very differently by future generations.  The story is a thought provoking, eye opening work by Edward P. Jones.	2003-10-14

He has retired from the LAPD and is now a private detective.  This time, however, he is working for himself on an unsolved murder of a young woman whose hands, posed in prayer as she lay dead, he can't seem to get out of his mind.<br />This is a classic novel along the lines of Chandler and Hammett.  The story is very good, the dialogue is great and there is just enough detail to intrigue you and  yet give nothing away.  Connelly combines Harry Bosch, murder, terrorism, millions of dollars and Hollywood into a fast paced, taut novel that never drops the ball.<br /> Connelly writes this novel in the first person, which means that Harry reveals more of his \\"inner workings\\" than he ever has before.  This is definitely a new level of getting to know the heart and soul of Bosch.<br />This novel can be read on it's own, but the more you are familiar with the character Harry Bosch, the greater this novel will be, especially when you reach the end.<br />Michael Connelly stated that he hoped to create a book that pulled the reader in and commanded their full attention, like being inside a giant wave for a surfer, a world where everything else but one thing is blurred outside the lines of reality, and I think he has created a story that does just that.	2003-04-12

David Toomey's well researched book has an astounding wealth of information that is both stunning in detail and fascinating in every aspect. This book drew my attention because of my own obsession with hurricanes, having been through several in North Carolina,(to include Fran, Bonnie,and Floyd ). During Floyd we were in the eye of the storm at night and went out and looked up into a clear, silent sky and watched as suddenly a hurricane hunter flew overhead, the only sound at all.<br />David Toomey details the thoughts that went into the changing views of weatheras a philosophy and the evolution into the science of meteorology. This transformation from philosophy to science is interesting. Weather phenomena was thought to be only a local event and the idea that weather traveled from one area to another was not even imagined. The idea of weather patterns was a foreign concept as well. Toomey details this transformation which spans the continents, including battles of very differing ideas. The leap in the quantity of scientific data and reliability of it's use from the the 1950's to present time is amazing.<br /> This scientific evolution was also a big push in the development of computers, originally called a \\"calculating clock\\"(in 1623), then \\"stepped reckoner\\" (1673), and then a giant leap to the \\"Difference Engine\\" in the 1830's. This subject in and of itself would have been a great subject.<br />Throughout all of this history of meteorology, the key aspect of this book centers on the people that flew into the hurricanes to obtain the data that would revolutionize hurricane forecasting. Their lives are opened and the picture that is viewed is of normal, everyday men. They saw their mission in life and pursued it, even in the face of daunting odds and tremendous danger. David Toomey has written a book that covers the world of hurricanes from the science to the very human and intimate aspects that surround them and has done so in a way that both educates and captivates your attention.our attention.	2003-03-26

A few grab at nothing, assuming that life has nothing to offer and therefore they make no effort at all. Russo delves into the importance of identifying what it is people want to achieve and why, and then setting real goals. Russo also displays an amazing ability to create the realistic, rough, give and take of emerging relationships, particularly between teenagers and parents, as the teenager stretches toward adulthood. The effects of parents on their children's future, the influence they inadvertently wield, even when they don't intend too is all too revealing.<br />Russo creates an intimate look into the lives of those in a small town who believe that their choices are limited or non-existent and balances these against those people who find a true joy in life, no matter the circumstances.	2003-03-21

That thread is the novel Mrs. Dalloway. One women is Virginia Woolf, the author of Mrs. Dalloway. Her story seems very loosely based (with much literary license) on the facts of Virginia Woolf's life. Then there is Clarissa Vaughan, a modern version of Mrs. Dalloway, who is nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway by a friend of hers at a young age. Like the Woolf character of Mrs. Dalloway, Clarissa Vaughan is also preparing to give a party. The third woman is Mrs. Brown, who is coping with her life as best she can, as she reads the novel, Mrs. Dalloway in her spare and stolen moments. This is a story that seems to dance between these three women, with the novel as the dance partner they all share at different moments. I read this two years ago and totally disliked it. This time I read Mrs. Dalloway first (although I feel that a novel should preferably stand on it's own feet)to try to gain an understanding of the style and meaning of this connecting link. I really gained a new appreciation for this novel and the gentle intertwining of the lives of these three women that Michael Cunningham has crafted in the intricate style of Virginia Woolf's writings. The delicate link between these women is more than just depression and a novel named Mrs. Dalloway. This is a novel crafted of intricate layers that, in the final chapters, gently unwrap themselves to reveal the real person that intimately joins these three women together.	2003-02-16

One of the aspects of this book is that the characters hold themselves responsible for the choices they make, good and bad, and rarely do those that love them throw their mistakes in their face.  It is about facing life in the worst situations with dignity and pride and trying to improve your situation through hardwork, education, determination and an ability to continue on and not give in, no matter what may come.  It is about a time when self reliability, hard work and family were highly valued, as opposed to an  entitlement mentality,  by those families like the Nolan's.  This is a classic American tale that will be appreciated by discerning readers.	2003-02-11

Virginia Woolf's novel Mrs. Dalloway is an intricate look at the everyday life of a woman, Clarissa Dalloway, who is preparing for a party she is giving.  The words embroider themselves in tiny, perfect stitches across the page giving depth and nuance to every detail of the lives and the surroundings  that enfold Clarissa Dalloway throughout this single day in her life.  While some people may feel like they are drowning in all the detail, for me it was like pulling a blanket over my head with a flashlight and tucking myself away from the world for a total &quot;immersion&quot; reading experience.  The way in which the lives mirror and oppose each other was an intricate balancing act that holds your attention until the end, when they touch each other, yet never collide.<br />I was also interested in the frequent mentioning and comparisons using flowers, and researched Victorian Flower symbolism and was surprised at the interesting interpretations this posed.<br />This is a classic look at the talent and abilities of Virginia Woolf.	2003-02-11

Kathyh Hepinstall tells  the tale of a mother, Martha, whose main concern in life is protecting her son, Duncan, from the evil possibilites of our society.  When the death of a young girl, a friend of Duncan's occurs, Martha's concern for her son's safety causes her to flee to a remote location, a cave on the Rio Grande in order to protect him not only from the world's dangers but also from the \\"madness\\" she perceives the father, David, to suffer from.  With each parent thinking that the other is crazy the story moves at a very fast, hectic pace, to an almost unnerving conclusion.  I wish this story had been more developed, more in depth, but the frenetic pace portrays a feeling of the madness that envelopes the lives of this family and I believe that this is intentional by the author.  Kathy Hepinstall has a unique penchant for the psychological thriller genre that she clearly displays in this short novel, leaving the reader to ponder the finale.	2003-02-11

He has no responsibilities and is given anything he wants. He lacks respect for anyone and that includes himself.  He is washed overboard from a luxury liner while on a trip with his mother and is picked up by a fisherman. The fishing boat can not return him immediately because they have a crew that needs to earn a living. Harvey's family presumes that he is dead, drowned at sea. The story of Harvey's growing up involves responsibilty, hard work, trust and honor.  Rudyard Kipling tells the story marvelously.  The story is brilliantly crafted and a pure delight to read.  The language of the story gives it the feel of the times and helps illustrate the rough lifestyles involved. This is a grand morality tale of adventure, human nature and the value of real love.  I read this as a young teenager, but now (many years later!!) I see what an awesome author Kipling truly was!!!!  This is a book to be read again!	2003-01-29

The Lovely Bones is a story, not about the murder of a young girl, or the tracking down of the murderer, but about everyone that is touched by the murder and how they adapt, grow and continue their lives. It is also about the murdered child, Susie Salmon, coming to terms with leaving her family behind on Earth. The story is told through the eyes of the murdered child as she watches from heaven. Her family is devastated,and begins to fall apart as her parents and siblings cope with the loss.  They begin to disconnect from each other as she observes them.  As Susie watches, she yearns to intervene somehow, as much as she yearns for a life that was cut short.  This was a very emotional story, and the thought of those in Heaven being so close was actually settling to me.  When Susie's family thinks of her she can hear their thoughts and that was a good feeling also. This was a very good story, told by a very talented writer.  There are a few incidents that I felt took away from this story.  One is a scene where Susie interacts with a young man she had been fond of, and some of the scenes that deal with the murderer added a sense of discord to the story.  Alice Sebold has written a beautiful story dealing with a horrible situation and has done a sensational job in evoking emotion and thought.	2003-01-25

This is a beautiful Southern novel that moves at it's own pace to paint a picture of a small town populated by unique individuals. It is told  through the eyes and ears of a young boy, Louis Benfield.  There is no pretense to the tale  Louis passes on to the reader, merely a child relaying what he has heard being said between adults or to him by an adult. The naivete and the simple artless manner that Louis passes on the information he has heard in conversations is the key to this delightful tale.  The stories all center at some point on Miss Myra Angelique, who was the beloved sister of the former Mayor.<br />The stories each take on a life of their own, but eventually find their way back to Miss Myra Angelique.  This book is full of wonderful Southern sayings and &quot;wisdom&quot; that will leave you laughing at their simplicity and homespun quality.  There is however an underlying complexity to this wisdom that weaves it's way into the Southern tale. T.R. Pearson leaves no stone unturned, even delving into the realities of prejudice and intolerance, not with any judgement involved, but as a part of the history of the town of Neely observed and interpretted through Louis's  young eyes, heart and soul.  T.R. Pearson can truly join the ranks of the true, great Southern writers. He portrays the Southern culture with delightful humor and honesty that evokes thoughtfulness and deliberation on the true meaning of the tale that has been carefully crafted with a casual feel.	2003-01-25

Suzanne Clothier has written a masterpiece!<br />While this is a beautifully written book whose main theme seems to be about &quot;deepening our relationships with dogs&quot;, it actually encompasses a much more important body of thought.  It is really a book about developing a richer more fulfilling and effective life in all relationships. Suzanne Clothier provides us the opportunity to learn that what we perceive as happening may very well be perceived differently by those in our lives, be they dogs, children,  a spouse or friends, or foreign nations<br />There are  many implications concerning leadership, not just as it applies to animals or even children but leadership overall.<br />Clothier states,&quot;In the end, our personal philosophy is also our best protection against cruelty. When we know what we believe and who we are, we stand stong and sure about what we will and will not allow.&quot;<br />Clothier quotes Goethe-&quot;Knowing is not enough; we must apply.  Willing is not enough; we must do.&quot;<br />&quot;One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it become an emergency.&quot; she quotes  Arnold Glasglow.<br />&quot;As ever, a small investment of our full selves reaps rewards without measure.&quot;,another quote from this book!<br />Don't let the title fool you, this is not really just about dogs ,but about people and how we live in this world and how we touch other's lives. It compels one to take an honest look at our relationships and then to proceed through this process, to enriching our lives by making positive changes in our dealings with those around us. Clothier quotes Thomas Jefferson,<br />&quot;Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.&quot;  We can only be wiser if we are honest with ourselves first.	2002-12-30

It is an inspiring story of life, love and loss. It is a story that makes you look at the perceived obstacles in life. Are they really obstacles and stumbling blocks, or are they really building blocks. The Carousel begins with a decision of a couple to marry secretly, at a very young age as they both begin their journey towards their own goals. The secrets they are forced to keep and the feelings they hide work against everything they thought that they wanted. This story wraps itself around every emotional chord and touches your heart with truth and honesty. Although Evans creates a very simple tale, it is by no means simplistic. It is probably the simplicity of his writing that makes The Carousel so wonderful and inspirational without being &quot;preachy&quot;. It remains in your heart long after this book has been tucked back onto it's shelf.	2002-12-16

The main character Julie was a true feminist. She never quit or gave up on anything,whether it was \\"fair\\" or not, hard or easy. She rarely worried about the opinions of others. She did what needed to be done. Instead of running back home to momma or just running off to look for an easier life, she kept her commitments. She actually understood what commitment meant and was willing to give whatever it took, no limits. She was a truly grounded woman and always approached situations with her faith, her heart and a big dose of reality. She spent little time worrying on things that she couldn't change. She had seen life and death and knew that life continued on no matter what happened, and there was no sense in just giving up and quitting. Julie was a person who lived in the present moment and did the very best she could each day. She never had her head in the clouds dreaming, but she enjoyed and experienced life to it's absolute totality. She was a truly inspiring, strong, Southern woman, and I loved her story.	2002-08-20

We Are Not Afraid is a very inspiring book about strength and courage in perilous times.  I think everyone who reads this will come away a stronger individual for it.  If you have children, sons, daughters, nieces or nephews I think it is even more important to read this!!!  The book was just such a \\"thinker\\".  It is only 213 pages, it reads quickly but it lasts long after you close the cover.<br />While it is a collection of stories about growing up in a small coal-mining town in West Virginia it  makes you stop and think hard about what really should be important in life, the values, the morals, the spirit, all the things that went into creating our great Nation. Mr. Hickam points out that yes times are perilous, but that there have been many perilous times and many hardships and challenges and being afraid is not a way to meet these.  He pulls no punches when he discusses the United States of America.  He dismisses those who want to focus on our failures as a Nation and fail to acknowledge our ability to correct our errors and move forward as a whole.  This book is a life lesson on how not to live your life in fear, and how to overcome and surmount obstacles in your way.  This is not accomplished by promising \\"pie-in-the-sky\\" but by learning from the examples of others ways to be strong and have courage and face life with your head up. This revolves around  four important attitudes. #1 We are proud of who we are. #2 We stand up for what we believe. #3 We keep our families together. #4 We trust in God but rely on ourselves.  These may sound simplistic to many people,  but when they are broken down and explained you will know that it is possible to live a good purposeful life and not be diminished by fear and to pass this on to those around you.	2002-08-08

Enemy Women is a story about life during the Civil War, but it much more than &quot;just&quot; that.  It is a story about life and loss, love and hate, hope and despair. It is a story about what happens when no one can remain neutral.<br /> The story centers on a young Missouri girl, Adair Colley,  who watches her father being beaten and  dragged away by the Union Militia.  Her brother escapes off into the mountains and Adair is left to take care of her sisters, the family home, and locating the prison where her father may be located.  She is arrested while on the search for her father and taken prisoner in a womens' prison in St. Louis, far away from her home.  Her life in the prison and her subsequent journey  to find her sisters, shed light on the realities of the war on a day to day level.<br />Each chapter of this revealing novel begins with excerpts from historical accounts, from private letters and diaries and from military documents that vividly relate actual events that follow the journey of Adair Colley.  They serve to emphasize the true face of the Civil War and the authenticity of the story and it's events,  showing that the events portrayed did in fact have mirror images in historical fact.<br />The vividness of this story is not in the conclusion of the story but it is in the journey of Adair Colley.  The author, Paulette Jiles, writes with a creative beauty and an intensity of observation that captures the reader and transports them through Adair's eyes and private thoughts into  war torn Missouri and the chaos and wonder that coincide in amazing ways.<br />Paulette Jiles is an acclaimed poet and has used her beautiful, evocative talent to create a clear, realistic and unforgettable picture of the life of Adair Colley, strong and independent, and  the  perilous times in Civil War Missouri.	2002-08-06

Isabel Allende is  a talented and gifted weaver of beautifully crafted stories.  Portrait in Sepia takes place after her previos novel, Daughter of Fortune, although it is not a true sequel. Reading Daughter of Fortune is a wonderful experience but not necessary in order to follow this novel.  This is a brilliant story of a young girl's past as she discovers the missing pieces to who she is.  She discovers her heritage, her true history and learns to understand that the mistakes and choices that people make are usually done for love or because of love. The characters are vivid and alive.  The women cover a wide spectrum, but many are strong, independent and loving women, with a clear picture of who they are and how they wish to live and knowledge of their own faults.  The men are also amazing characters, from the strong to the weak, all with real human flaws and strengths,  that make them very real.  Portrait in Sepia is a study of the human soul, always present, always visible for those who truly take the time to look.	2002-05-28

She is a young attorney who believes that there is a perfect balance to everything in the Universe, but is unable to attain it for fear of causing disorder imbalance .  She is unwilling to risk trying for fear of having to take the responsibility that goes with choosing the path of action and would rather react to anything that is going on or being said than act first.  She is unwilling to bend her idea of perfection, so much so that she pursues it not at all.  I found her irritating and wanted to shake her out of her improbable notions.  I felt pity for those in her life who had to deal with her routinely and admired those who expressed their disdain for her attitude.  The novel seems to have a moral to it, if you don't try you achieve nothing, if you try at least you learn even when making mistakes, to do nothing is a waste of a life.<br />This was a very different novel from anything I have read lately.  I had to put it away for a while because I found the young woman so aggravating, but I am glad that I finished the book.	2002-05-22

When she wins the school spelling bee no one can believe it!  As her spelling accomplishments progress, her family begins to unravel.  Her mother Miriam sees the ability of her daughter to focus on the order of letters in  words and begins to pursue her own dream of perfection more intensely.  The father, a Jewish man of strong faith, begins to channel all his attention to his daughter, along with his pursuit of Jewish mysticism.  Previously, all of his attention had been focused on his teen-age son, aiming him at a spiritual life.  The son, Aaron, then begins to seek out the face of God on his own, leading him into new territory.<br />Through out this novel each character is seeking perfection in their own manner, but what occurs is complete disorder.  How this can go from chaos to order again is hard to imagine, but one of these individuals thinks that they can re-order their universe and attempts to do so in a totally unselfish manner.<br />The family is interesting, the story well told and the ending...well...selfless.	2002-04-10

Diana Gabaldon has created a wonderful novel full of detail and emotion that easily draws the reader into the lives of the Fraiser clan, an  amazing array  of characters living and surviving in the hills of pre-Revolutionary North Carolina. The characters are so full of life and so well developed that it is easy to fall  into their lives through the pages of this novel.  Having read the last four of this series made it so familiar, but I think that even had one not read these books, the book would still be good.<br />The ability of some of the members to travel through time in order to reunite as a family poses many intersting possibilities and concepts. Will those who are time travelers change the future by their presence, by their ideas, by their knowledge of not only history( a coming Revolution) and what is to come, but their knowledge of medical information(disease and infection treatments) etc.  Are there others who are in the &quot;wrong time&quot;?<br />Under what circumstances would you change your future by traveling back to your own time?  Would there be a situation that would cause you to leave your current life and abandon your family? What is truly important to each person shows through.<br />The details of everyday living presents an interesting contrast between all that is necessary to go through each day filled with the knowledge of how easy life in your own time is in comparison.  Some of the contrasts that go through your mind, managing diapers and other laundry, preventing infection, innoculations,slaughtering animals, getting from place to place, the mail,  clearing land etc.<br />The conversations dealing with what they dreamed about (driving their cars) and the foods they had a craving for (pizza and beer)  were interesting when contrasted with their actual circumstances.<br />This was an interesting, beautifully painted novel that draws you into the heart of  this family, focusing on love, faith, trust and the meaning of family.	2002-03-15

Fall On Your Knees is a novel that contains every ugly possibility that can happen within a family.  While hope briefly flickers from time to time, it is always firmly snuffed out. Desperation colors every action and thought.<br />Ann-Marie MacDonald's  multigenerational novel about the Piper family takes place on Cape Breton. This is a story of pedophilia, shunning, incest, abuse, hate, obsession, racism, abandonment, murder, lust, suicide, kidnapping,and torrential lies.  Playing in the background is the relentless sound of shattering dreams. Through all of this the Catholic Church plays the role of concealer and co-conspirator of horrible secrets.  The Catholic Church is also made to appear to promote false hopes with rituals and unanswered prayers at every turn, by nearly every character.  The prayers offered in this novel are as effective as talking to a wall, no one is really there listening and there is NEVER any answer.  If someone knew nothing about the Catholic faith this novel would be the opposite of enlightening!!<br />The author does an amazing job of plumbing the depths of despair in a wide variety of characters.  All of her characters are carefully crafted and complex.  The story is told back and forth through time in a manner well designed not to fit the final pieces of the puzzle together until the very end.  Even when you are sure that you know what the picture will look like  you may be surprised.<br />There is something about this novel that is so reminiscient of WE WERE THE MULVANEYS, and that \\"something\\" is a story devoid of any true love, any real hope or any  honest faith.  FALL ON YOUR KNEES has been described as a wild ride, and I agree, like being trapped in a crashing train, you see, hear and feel it happening, you can't stop looking, you can't stop it from happening and you can't get away.  I think the author has a stunning ability to create and weave multi-faceted characters in a complex web of drama and this is a breath taking first novel of desolation and despair.f desolation and despair.	2002-02-01

It is an inspiring  story of life, love and loss.  It is  a story that makes you look at the perceived obstacles in life.  Are they really obstacles and stumbling blocks, or are they really  building blocks.  The Carousel begins with a decision of a  couple to marry secretly, at a very young age as they both begin their journey towards their own goals.  The secrets they are forced to keep and the feelings they hide work against everything they thought that they wanted.  This story wraps itself around every emotional chord and touches your heart with truth and honesty. Although Evans creates a very simple tale, it is by no means simplistic. It is probably the simplicity of his writing that makes The Carousel so wonderful and inspirational without being &quot;preachy&quot;. It remains in your heart long after this book has been tucked back onto it's shelf.	2002-01-11

Using a few paragraph at the beginning of each chapter subtitled &quot;my father writes&quot;, Eve lays down family history as recorded by her father.  Following the &quot;father&quot; paragraphs is an imagined embellishment based on these stories that she was told.<br />The story begins in Palestine in 1837.  The history of this Jewish family is interesting because parts of it are factual and a general overview of this historical period is accurate(the author documents several sources that helped and inspired her).  The manner in which the story is told gets to be a bit disjointed and the flow of the story seems impeeded.  Some characters are so full and lush, and several are very one dimensional<br />Another facet to the novel is the information on life with an orchard.  The family has a citrus orchard and the facts on grafting, along with detailed drawings and a manual of orchard terms attempts to draw you into the life of the family and to confirm their reality. It too is an interesting method, although questionably effective if that was the intent.<br />Overall this was an interesting novel and in this era of religious/political unrest it was an interesting take on a Jewish perspective and that in itself makes it worth the time to read.	2001-12-14

This is a discovery of love in all it's many trappings and it's glorious revelations. The story begins with a conversation between two insomniacs, a conversation centering on love.  The novel proceeds with stories told by several different people whose lives become slowly  intertwined throughout the novel. The people are married couples, ex-couples, father and son, teenagers, and single people.  They come from such a variety of backgrounds, financially, racially, and religiously, that it seems impossible to gather them all into one tale.  Charles Baxter does it and does it well.  Love, being the central theme, is villified, nullified, admired, defiled,  wished for, lost, found  and sought after.  This is an interesting look at love in all it's facets.  This novel will surprise you with it's unusual approach and easy going style.	2001-11-26

This is an amazing portrait of Lieutenant General Lewis B. &quot;Chesty&quot; Puller, a Marine's Marine!  This book has been scrupulously researched and documented by the author, and then rendered into an exacting biography that reveals the true nature of &quot;Chesty Puller.  Even with the &quot;warts&quot; that were glossed over in the past by previous biographers, the legendary status of &quot;Chesty&quot; Puller continues to remain intact.  He was decorated with five Navy Crosses for valor, more than any other Marine.  Puller was a tough, aggressive leader who expected the most from his Marines.  He led from the front, never expecting more from his men than he himself was willing to give.<br />  The details of his leadership in battles from Haiti to Nicaragua, to Guadalcanal, Peleliu and Korea give a true, concise insight into the mind of Puller, and clarify why he made the decisions that he did.<br />  The author's use of direct quotations from Puller's official and unofficial records and correspondence gives an authentic flavor of the times, the man and the attitudes of other towards Puller.  It provides a unique perspective that is an integral part of this biography.<br />  His love for his wife and his family are clearly shown in the personal letters between &quot;Chesty&quot; and his wife, Virginia.  While this tender, loving side of Puller may seem to some as almost incongruous, it in fact appears to be a key aspect of his heart and soul.  This caring side is shown repeatedly in his reflections on the Marines and sailors wounded and killed under his command.  His aggressive fighting tactics had a purpose, to win each battle as rapidly as possible, thereby reducing his losses.<br />  He was an outspoken Marine, not one to worry much about being &quot;politically correct&quot;, openly and honestly commenting on, and criticizing those people and decisions he saw as compromising the war effort.  Many of his beliefs are as true today as they were when he stated them.  He believed that airpower was not a complete solution and never would be.  He also believed the view of going to war and not suffering any casualties was a flawed and dangerous philosophy.  He believed that the American people needed to know that a &quot;clean war&quot; was not a realistic view of what was needed to win a war....&quot;We can lick 'em, if America gets hard....Just as long as Americans have the will to fight.&quot;  He knew that freedom wasn't free and Americans had to be willing to pay the price, both individually and as a country.  HIS BELIEFS ARE TIMELESS.  His voice is as important now as it was then,  perhaps more so in light of the horrendous events of 9-11-01.<br />  This is an accurate, well researched, open, honest and revealing portrait of &quot;Chesty&quot; Puller, Marine, leader, teacher, husband, father and American.tated them.

This book was highly recommended by a group of people who work with Greyhound adoption, as a means to altering behavior that occurs in an older adopted dog.  I used it with a great dane puppy and even when I think it may not work, I have not been dissapointed in anything the author writes.

I have looked at many books on how to train puppies, and this is the one that I keep going back to, in fact it is the only one I continuously used after we got our pup, a Great Dane.  It explains how a puppy matures and when is the best time to get your puppy in order for the puppy to become a part of your &quot;family pack&quot;.  I have followed this book in it's advice for training a puppy, which means starting from the very beginning.  At the age of 12 weeks Buck, our puppy, will sit, lay down, come, walk nicely on a leash, and will sit-stay and down-stay for short periods of time.  He also will shake your hand, which isn't in the book, but using their methods of praise for behavior you like, this was easily taught!! The house-breaking went unbelievably well and this too was due to the advice of the Monks.  This book is an excellent choice for first timers and also for those who have had dogs before.  This book helps you to understand things from a puppy's viewpoint and how to use this understanding to help your puppy mature into a wonderful part of your family.  If you are someone who thinks that dogs belong outside of your house, away from the family,  hopefully this book can change your mind. The most important information that I got from this book was this,  don't let your pup do things as a pup that you don't want him doing as a big dog. This book is indispensable!!!	2001-07-23

This picture of life then shows the harsh realities of death and disease, of families being destroyed and the attempts to continue to reach for dreams and continue living and working and hoping for better times.  It also portrays the lifestyles of the very wealthy and well known.  The novel revolves around the Johnstown flood, the people who lived and worked in the iron works in Johnstown, and the secluded private resort above Johnstown, where a group of wealthy families spent there summers.  From the beginning of the story you know that many people  will be destroyed by the great flood, but you wonder which of the people you meet will be affected, and who will survive.  The lives of all the characters are intimately described, what they think, how they live, who they love and their hopes for their future.  As the story progresses you see how a lack of understanding and a lack of desire to change a pattern of life is leading up to the disastrous flooding of Johnstown.  While the flood itself seems to center the novel, it actually takes up very few pages in the novel.  The horrifying description of the flood occuring is vivid and catastrophic.  The reactions to the devastation by the American public will seem familiar, the reaction of those who were ultimately responsible also ring true.  This was an interesting story about a horrendous disaster and the people will be forever changed.	2001-07-18

The story line was very interesting and really pulls you rapidly along. This is a reprint from the 1954 novel, with all the then censored scenes returned to the story, as the author originally intended to present the story. You will see why many of these were deleted from the novel in 1954! This is a wild ride of a story, filled with lust,sex,trust, betrayal and greed in many forms, and the attempt to see which of these drives people the strongest. One man's lust leads to a major collision with his family on one end and a business enemy on the other. A death is the only way out, yet no one sees this coming.

US	51112341	R19LHS3ZNPKXUM	0452282233	669427211	True North	Books	3	4	5	N	N	true life....	My impressions of this novel are that Kimberly Kafka provides authentic experience in her writing about living in the wilds of Alaska.  She clearly portrays Alaskan natives and their feelings and political ideas and why they feel disenfranchised and abandoned by white America.  This novel tells the story of a young  white woman from Maine who escapes to a difficult, but fulfilling life in Alaska.  There is a man from Alaska who is trying to walk a thin line between learning how to live with the white people who have money and political power and on the flip side, the indigenous Alaskans who want the white people completely excluded from Alaskan life.  The details of their lives are well written and give a clear picture of what this kind of life entails.  Finally there is a young couple, both white, who come to Alaska to search for gold, even though their tourist permit clearly excludes that.  The twists and turns and emotional  rollercoaster that evolves through this story is wonderfully done.  The ending is not &quot;spoon-fed&quot; to the reader and is one that leaves you thinking about the characters and what they were really looking for long after you have finished this tale.  The inter-weaving of the lives of these main characters always leaves you wondering and thinking about what each person wants and needs, and at what expense must each one go to, to achieve what is best for them.  It also demonstrates the difficulty of balancing one persons desires with thbest interests of the larger group as a whole.  This was an interesting novel.	2001-06-04

This novel is an absolutely stunning work that tells the story of &quot;ordinary&quot; men in extraordinary circumstances and what they were capable of. This is an honest, open look at the lives of the men on Iwo Jima, and the harsh reality that they were a part of. The description of the slaughter on the small island is so real and so heart wrenching that you know that anyone who was not there can barely begin to truly perceive the battle conditions that went on beyond time. It is an in-depth story of those who raised the replacement flag on Iwo Jima and how that event touched their lives. The central figure in this amazing book is the author's father. The author was driven to write this book because until his father died he never really knew much about what his father had done in service to his country. His father's life should be an inspiration to all who read this book, or who knew him. He was a man who lived his life with no desire to seek after fame or glory even though he could have done otherwise. He saw the worst that mankind had to offer and seemed to decide that living a life focused on his family and friends and town was what was really important. He knew the word hero and believed that those who had given their lives were the true heroes. Fame due to an incidental raising of a flag, no matter how important this event was to the American public, did not give him the feeling of being a hero. He left too many dead friends behind for him to assume that his role was unique. The lives of the other men in the flag raising photograph are also detailed and it makes for a very special story. I come from a military family background and am married to a Marine. Does this make the book more intense for me, maybe. MAybe it makes it more real. I read this book and finished it by November 10th, the birthday of the Marine Corps, in order to really appreciate the birthday celebration more. During the Birthday Ball, the part of the ceremony where they say &quot;We come from a long proud line of Marines and we are honored to be a part of this heritage..&quot; it held new meaning for me, it isn't just words anymore. This book is open, honest, blunt and real. It is filled with hope, despair, fear,love, triumph, tragedy and faith. Some of the men came through it all, and pulled their lives together, and some, no matter how far from Iwo Jima they were, never really left. This is one of the most outstanding books I have ever read. It should be required reading in high schools across the country. There is now an abridged version put out for middle schoolers and up to fill this need.

Dave Eggers book is a combination of open honesty usually found in young children (before the world gets its hands on them) and the wisdom and fears of those who have suffered and survived loss and extreme challenges.  At an age when most young men feel themselves invulnerable and invincible, this young man has seen reality and knows death can be  but a moment away for anyone.  The book begins with the deaths of his parents several months apart, from different causes.  He and his older sister and brother make some strong decisions and Dave becomes the &quot;parent&quot; of the youngest brother, Toph.  They move to California from the midwest to continue their lives.  As a young man in his early twenties, raising his brother is an interesting experience, and alone these tales would make an interesting novel.  The unique aspects of the novel are all the personal insights and observations that flow unfiltered from the mind of Dave Eggers, and there are a lot.  They remind you of the way a child asks a person, &quot;Why are you fat?  Why are you in a wheelchair?...etc&quot;  A child does not mean to be nasty but simply observes a fact and asks about it, they want to understand the whys, whats and  hows of it. This gathering of information and the pairing of it with an adult life experience, the pondering and examining of all of his life's little details is what makes this book such an interesting novel.  He doesn't pretend to hold the key of knowledge, in fact, he doesn't seem to pretend at all.  He holds back nothing, no matter what light it may have cast hiim in at the time.  He basically presents you with the story of how he dealt with his life, examined all the possibilities and fears of different experiences and as for obstacles..he went around them, over them or through them.	2001-05-25

To see the change in weather forecasting from then until now is amazing. To understand the unpredictability of storms even in this day and age is frightening. The devastation wrought by this storm is so completely thorough,and the author does a superior job of rendering a picture that the reader can grasp. The actual historical perspective, blended with the memories of Isaac should cause everyone to understand that nature has uncontrollable power and deserves our respect. Anyone who lives in an area where there is possible hurricane activity should read this book and then learn to prepare and plan for an eventual hurricane. The devastation of Floyd went way beyond the immediate coastline where most people think the main damage occurs. Since then the National Hurricane Center has realized that new ratings for damage potential and water amounts need to be developed. As &quot;weather smart&quot; as the people of Isaac's time thought they were, are we not as smuggly self assured as they were. Storms can do unexpected things no matter how closely they are monitored. This was an excellent book about how mother nature doesn't have a trip itinerary, but moves as her spirit strikes.	2001-05-21

It brilliantly and clearly shows you the people that will be drawn together, into a downward spiraling of events. An immigrant who was an important man in his homeland, a cop in an empty marriage, and a young woman who has been involved with drugs and abandoned by her husband, are leading their own lives when events place the same California bungalow at the center of each of their lives. The house becomes a way for each person to surmount the obstacles in their way and to make a fresh new start. Not everyone can have the house at once, and that is the predicament that swirls at the center of this novel. What end will each player go to, to ensure that they are the one to be successful? How far over the line will each one dare to go, and at what point is there no turning back? This was a dark novel, very vivid in the descriptions of both physical surroundings(the fog, the woods etc.) and emotional outlook of each character. The story quickly pulls the reader in and is an excellent novel.	2001-05-21

Cathy Scarlet and Neil marry against all odds.  Cathy, the maid's daughter marries into a wealthy family. Neil is a successful lawyer.  Tom Feather and Marcella live together. Tom is in the food business and Marcella wants to be a world class model.  Cathy and Tom join together to form a catering business.  Nearly everyone is single-focused on what their personal goals are, to the detriment of their relationships. Neils' wealthy parents seem to yearn for a close knit, loving family, but not enough to make it happen.  Cathy's working class family is full of love and seems willing to make sacrifices for each other.  Cathy's Aunt Geraldine leads a life that is far different from what the family believe s it to be.  Tom's family is a bit disjointed.  They can't seem to understand how to draw themselves closer .  Into the middle of all this are thrown a set of children, twins, whose parents are unable to care for them in any semblance of normal.  The mother is a non-functioning alcoholic and the father is always \\"wandering off\\" for extended periods of time.  The children are the niece and nephew of Neil's father.  The childrens'  problems appear to slowly evoke a focus on where everyone's priorities lay.  For some this is a good experience leading to a reordering of life's priorities.  For others it merely leads to entrenched thinking.  The ending was \\"too good to be true\\", but then this is a story, not reality.  This was a gentle, pleasant read.  The characters were a bit one-sided and underdeveloped, which made the story more simple, not simplistic however.  The mystery surrounding the building that they purchased was odd, in that the whole story could have been complete with out the secret!!	2001-05-16

This is a fascinating look at the history of China from the 1890's  through the mid 1900's.  The story is told through the eyes and observations of Spring Moon, who begins the novel as a young girl.  Her feet had been bound as was traditional, symbolizing a person who has their feet planted firmly in the old ways and traditions, yet her mind measures and tests everything she sees and hears.  This is a complete contradiction of the old ways, when young girls were silent and did as they were instructed.  Her eldest Uncle makes the decision to teach her to read and write, and in so doing, opens her mind to yet more questions.  The story proceeds through the opening of Chinese ports to foreign trade,control and influence (particularly Christianity, the period of &quot;secret societies&quot; against the Manchu dynasty, the Boxer Rebellion, the return of the Empress Dowager to the throne,  the 1911 Chinese Revolution, the Kuomintang period of control,  Japanese demands in 1915, a subsequent period of warlords and various factional control, World War I, more civil war, the founding of the Communist Party, the  divisiveness between the Communists and the Kuomintang parties, the &quot;Long March&quot; of the Communists to escape death, and all the way through to when China was &quot;opened&quot; and Chinese who had fled were able to go back.  While this seems like an extensive historical list,  it is lived by Spring Moon, her daughter, and their extended family.  It expertly weaves the story of their lives and those around them, breathing life into a story of the Chinese culture and China's conflict strewn  history.  It paints a clear picture of each side and of those caught in the middle.  The wonderful talent of this author, Bette Bao Lord,  manages to do all this and never once loose the readers attention.  This was a truly wonderful story.	2001-05-03

I have learned a lot and have discovered some good wine, some great wine, and one really bad Bordeaux!!  It is fun and is something that a couple can enjoy together and with friends.  If school were this fun I would have gone for a PHD.  While not a previous fan of the &quot;For Dummies&quot; series, this one is worth reading!!	2001-04-24

While I have always enjoyed Dick Francis novels, this one included, I felt that this one was not one of his winning tales.  Shattered was a good read, and if you have any interest in glass-blowing, don't miss this.  Gerard Logan is a great character, very interesting and likable.  His friendship with a jockey, Martin Stukely, brings about a series of events involving some video tapes that change hands frequently and that someone will go to any length to obtain.  What ensues is the pursuit of clues to find out what is on the vidoetape that everyone thinks Gerard possesses or at least possesses the knowledge of.  The actual content of the tapes was interesting, but not stunning.  The &quot;bad guys&quot;(should I say &quot;bad girl&quot;) in the story are definitely not nice people, but they are not fully flushed out characters, and lack the well rounded evil characters that Francis has always written about so well. Rose, the main antagonist is just plain nasty-mean, but you never really get why.  Maybe you don't need to? Rose surrounds herself with men whom she intimidates, mentally and physically, and gets them to back her up, as if this woman needs back-up!  The family of the deceased jockey, the Stukelys, were a kick, especially the mother-in-law, Marigold!!  Gerard's romantic interest was good.  The people he surrounds himself with to protect him were very unusual and quirky, even if not always successful. The final scene is unexpected and full of danger! If I were not comparing this to other Dick Francis novels this would have ranked higher.  I enjoyed this, but in comparison to his other works this was just not as wonderfully done.  Not a winner, but definitely a fun, good read.	2001-04-24

The story takes place in China.  The wife is not a worldly woman, but she has been a faithful wife, a good mother and taken care of her in-laws in their old age, illness and death. Her husband seems to be a man who has not truley known love, his marriage was arranged and was a &quot;suitable&quot; match.  He lives away from his family and visits them once a year.  His female companion, a comrade at the hospital, believes that she should be his wife and after many tries to start a life without him, she decides to wait until he is allowed to divorce his wife. The span of this tale is an 18 year marriage. The story  portrays the lives of the people in China.It describes the military and political aspects as well as their daily routines, living conditions, meals and attitudes etc.  It does so in a very concise and simple manner that gives you a clear glimpse into their lives.  All of the characters seem to be waiting for contentment and love....the question is who waits the most patiently and eventually receives what it realy is that they were waiting for.  This is an interesting book and very well written. The big surprise is which character(s) you really dislike and which you care about.	2001-04-22

One is a young girl from a family that is thrown into depressed circumstances when the father is blinded in an accident.  The second person is the artist Vermeer, a brilliant painter, who left behind less than 40 completed paintings.  In this story Griet, the young girl, out of necessity, goes to work as a maid for the Vermeer family.  Griet has certain qualities that seem to draw Vermeer to her.  Her first responsibilty is to clean his studio without rearranging any of his tools, paints or settings.  She accomplishes this perfectly.  When she reconsiders cleaning the windows because she perceives that it will change the quality of light that he is using as he is completing a painting, Vermeer seems to become intrigued with this young girl.  Eventually Vermeer uses her as more of an artist's assistant and eventually decides to use her as the subject in a painting.  The problems that their relationship cause are thoroughly explored by the author, making the characters very much real and alive.  This was an interesting look at the possible life of Vermeer, based on what small amount of information that is actually  known, this made for an interesting look at the life of this artist.	2001-04-02

This book was recommended by a friend who had just been to Paris.  It has all the information you need, from how to get from the airport to your hotel (shuttle is best), to hotels (listed by location and price), to restaurants(by area, specialties and price). It explains the cuisine of the different regions of France  and which restaurants to find them in. It also notes the ambience of many restaurants, ie French attitude, or catering to non-French speaking patrons.  It explains the best ways of getting around Paris, the top ten sights, off the beaten path sights, shopping guides for everything from jewelry, to wine, to porcelain, to food etc.  It has guides and maps for wonderful walking tours of the different arrondisements (areas/distrcits) that take you past historically,literary and architecturally significant places. It tells you about the tourist sights (Moulin Rouge) where Parisians rarely frequent, as well as the places Parisians love to go.  It also has information on organized tours, tips on  Museum passes and Metro passes and a decent regular sized folding map of Paris is included in the back. Additionaly, there is wonderful information on trips outside of Paris, such as Versailles and Chartre. This makes planning your trip fun and enjoyable.  This book is well worth owning if you are going to Paris soon, and if not buy it anyway, planning ahead is always a good idea!	2001-03-12

James Lee Burke has written his best novel to date.  In this story, Robicheaux is dealing with new information on his mother's death that has the power to change things in his head.  His daughter, Alafair may be in danger from a truly sociopathic young man, and two sisters (and one of them is facing death row) are hiding information on the murder of a pedophile . The other question is, why does Connie Deshotel the attorney general of Louisiana keep showing up at the most opportune times? The characters all come together in a strange James Lee Burke manner, surrounded by the mystery and beauty of Southern Louisiana as only Burke has the power to eloquently detail.  His settings are so pure, you can smell the bayous, and the sun coming down  through the branches of the moss covered trees.  His descriptions defy you not to experience his Louisiana. The people are so well defined, and their actions and intent are clear.  As always a James Lee Burke novel is a 5 star experience.	2001-02-24

The story is stark, harsh truth and while this is a difficult story to read and bear, it is worth each moment.  While it details the killing of babies, children and women in horrifying truth, Mr. Wiesel does not stop there.  He addresses the question of why and how this occured in his town when there were ample warnings about the future,..  that no one believed it would actually happen to them, there....  His openess about the experience of having your faith shattered and yet still believing enough to be mad at God was brilliantly done.  While I have read several books about the Holocaust this one was the most vivid and real to me. The details of life in the camps,and the extremes to which some would go to &quot;merely&quot; to survive were heart and soul wrenching.  Seeing this through his eyes was an amazing experience.  I have had this book for nearly a year before I read it.  I knew the story of the concentration camps and wasn't sure I wanted to learn anymore than I already had.  This book is horrifying, startling and an amazing revelation from a  true survivor.	2001-02-12

There is only one person who is convinced that the death is not an accident, but a vicious racially motivated crime of hate. This main character nearly looses her mind in the following days, and weeks.  To save her marriage and her mind, she moves out of the country, but she never forgets about the woman who died.  Twenty years later she and her family return to England, and her purpose is to prove that it was murder and catch the killer.  She has spent the twenty years carefully gathering information and evidence, and  now begins to move her information and those involved like chess pieces in order to attain her goal. Was the investigation done improperly due to the racial prejudice of the police in charge? Was the murderer one person or several? Who was involved in trying to cover up evidence ranging from theft, animal cruelty, adultery, rape, child abuse and more. The question arises, is she in it for justice or for revenge and why?  Minette Walters includes letters, notes and e-mails and other correspondence in each chapter of her novel, which while at first glance was a bit disconcerting, began to make you feel a part of the discovery process.  Bit by bit each character is revealed in an ever changing light, revealing their past, their motive and their part in the death of the neighborhood woman.	2001-01-25

She is a skilled artist, painting a  clear but bleak picture of life in the boondocks of Montana.  The parallels of the lives of various women with the life of a female coyote was interesting, but the short story Sister Coyote was a depressing, hopeless tale that literally  removes any breath of hope.

This is a terrific novel that centers around the mysterious efforts of an unknown person/group that is sabotaging archaeological expeditions that deal with Columbus and pre-Columbian  history.  The first part of this wonderful novel begins on the Andrea Dorea on the eve of its sinking and raises many interesting questions.  The story proceeds from there and involves a hot button topic involving the forecast secession of the Southwest United States.  I have read about this issue from several sources, so I found this particularly fascinating that it would be involved in a novel. As always the beautiful characters of Clive Cussler fill the pages with life.  Kurt Austin is a terrific character, even to a hard-core Dirk Pitt fan!!	2001-01-02

On the historical side the picture painted of Savannah was beautiful and enticing, full of the rich Southern and Irish-Catholic heritage that Savannah is so proud of.  The families portrayed were full and in-depth studies of the individuals and their family heritage, good and bad.  The novel begins with a unique bond between two good men, one a white Confederate soldier, the other a slave.  The bond is friendship and trust.  The novel traces family history in an intriguing plot involving serial murder, betrayal, greed and also love, brotherhood, trust and true faith.  The families' lives intertwine again and again through history.  This novel was far different that what I had expected it to be about, but I can say I was not at all disappointed.  I was very moved by the strong key role that the characters faith in God and their relationship to the Catholic faith played and how it was their strength and life saver in their many struggles with betrayal, disappointment, drugs, war and death.  From the Civil War to Vietnam and beyond this was a wonderfully crafted novel.  This is not the typical \\"Irish Sad Story\\", where when it's over you heave a big sad sigh.  This is a wonderful tale of a family, true love and a rich faith in a beautiful Southern setting.	2000-12-22

It is a story of ultimate family love, personal secrets and guilt. It pivots around personal secrets that never really vanish and the consequences and guilt that come from trying to keep a secret. One of the things I enjoyed most about this book was that I kept thinking I knew what was going to happen next, or some strange twist I was sure I knew was coming next, there would be a subtle shift and the story would travel down a slightly different path.  Sometimes the shifts were more dramatic, but it made me continue to follow the author along the path to see where it ended up.

This novel is an absolutely stunning work that tells the story of &quot;ordinary&quot; men in extraordinary circumstances and what they were capable of.  This is an honest, open look at the lives of the men on Iwo Jima, and the harsh reality that they were a part of.  The description of the slaughter on the small island is so real and so heart wrenching that you know that anyone who was not there can barely begin to truly perceive the battle conditions that went on beyond time.  It is an in-depth story of those who raised the replacement flag on Iwo Jima and how that event touched their lives.  The central figure in this amazing book is the author's father. The author was driven to write this book because until his father died he never really knew much about what his father had done in service to his country.  His father's life should be an inspiration to all who read this book, or who knew him.  He was a man who lived his life with no desire to seek after fame or glory even though  he could have done otherwise.  He saw the worst that mankind had to offer and seemed to decide that living a life focused on his family and friends and town was what was really important.  He knew the word hero and believed that those who had given their lives were the true heroes.  Fame due to an incidental raising of a flag, no matter how important this event was to the American public, did not give him the feeling of being a hero.  He left too many dead friends behind for him to assume that his role was unique.  The lives of the  other men in the flag raising photograph are also detailed and it makes for a very special story.  I come from a military family background and am married to a Marine.  Does this make the book more intense for me, maybe.  MAybe it makes it more real.  I read this book and finished it by November 10th, the birthday of the Marine Corps, in order to really appreciate the  birthday celebration more.  During the Birthday Ball, the part of the ceremony where they say &quot;We come from a long proud line of Marines and we are honored  to be a part of this heritage..&quot;  it held new meaning for me, it isn't just words anymore.   This book is open, honest, blunt and real.  It is filled with hope, despair, fear,love, triumph, tragedy and faith. Some of the men came through it all, and pulled their lives together, and some, no matter how far from Iwo Jima they were, never really left.  This is one of the most outstanding books I have ever read.  It should be  required reading in high schools across the country.	2000-11-20

Hard working, hard partying, and completely consumed by their passion for food and the lifestyle that goes with it.  The section on how to cook like a professional was full of information on equipment needed and well presented.

I loved Rocket Boys so much and didn't think it could happen again.  Then along came The Coalwood Way!!  This is a marvelous book about life.  Homer takes the reader on a journey to a time when lives and times were changing, not always for the best.  The author shows us a picture of a coal town and the Country in a period of transition, much like Sonny and his friends in their period of transition from high school, stepping into their future. The story  tells us that no matter how bright or strong or motivated someone is, that life can throw some hard curve balls, and it is always good to know that you can count on family, friends and neighbors. Mr. Hickam also points out the importance of looking out for each other and knowing when it is time to step up to the plate for others.  The story ends with a brilliant Christmas scene that really tells the reader that we are a wondrous creation molded by all the experiences in our lives, those that happen to us and those that we initiate ourselves and that always, always, the Creator's hand is with us.  That he can do all this in &quot;The Coalwood Way&quot;  without once being preachy is unique.  This was an inspiring book, that takes real life examples and attempts to draw the readers along to look at the big picture of life.  This book was fun, humorous, introspective, open, honest and very touching. I enjoyed it immensely.	2000-11-02

The details that are so clear to a child, the sounds,the tastes, the physical feel of things, the lack of conversational detail and nuance, the end results of the day, all give a clean and simple feel to this story.  The way that the different children have a slightly different perspective on the same occasion or type of occasion was insightful beyond ordinary reason.  The children did not automatically connect one happening in their lives to another.  To them there was no trainload of fault and blame to be emptied at every unhappy ( or happy) occurance. Sometimes good things just happen, sometimes bad. They  seemed to feel that life just unfolded itself for them to observe it. The simplicity of a childs acceptance of things in their life is accomplished only through the complex thought and the gentle hand of an excellent writer like Alice McDermott.  The entire novel was like a walk through the park holding a child's hand, as they open their heart to you completely, trying to help you understand life as they perceive it.  Alice McDermott seems to know that it is not the destination but the journey itself that make life worthwhile.	2000-10-23

It takes you through their childhood, schooling, and their maturing into women of purpose, who dedicated their lives to their families and to their country.  The characterizations of the sisters were a bit too simplistic, but still the story of their lives, dreams and desires was very well done. The story begins from the point of view of the surviving sister, Dede.  Her feelings about being the survivor were excruciating and so honest that I find it hard to think that the author did not get these portions of the  story directly from Dede. The story wraps itself in and out of the sisters lives, and is laced with religious faith and family strength, and sisterly bonds that can never be wrenched apart.<br />The portrayal of Trujillo, the dictator, was chilling and vivid as far as it went. The torture and disappearing of people was also clearly portrayed for the horror that it was.  This is an excellent story and gives a realistic, although fictionalized picture of a turbulent period in the political and social structure of the Dominican Republic.	2000-10-11

This story, while dealing with a dead woman who washes up on an English cove keeps you in complete suspense until the very end.  Who would have wanted her dead and why?  The list of suspects is long and the reasons are varied. Her husband, her mother-in-law, a young actor with a penchant for sex and pornography, a cannabis smoking school teacher obsessed with the actor, or is it someone else altogether.  The clues mount up against everyone and the motives for her murder do too. It takes a calm and careful investigator to sort out all the details and PC Nick Ingram is the perfect man for the job. While there were parts of the story that were a bit too explicit for some the story fits together wonderfully, and along the way PC Ingram manages to renew a friendship with a woman whose life was turned upside down by a prior investigation.  I will definitely read more Minette Walters books.	2000-09-30

Easy Prey was a good story, but it was a bit different from the rest  of the series. If you haven't read any of the others (therefore, aren't  comparing) this was a great book. Multiple suspects for several murders  that may or may not be connected...It keeps you guessing until the end.  The characters and their relationships to each other are surprising, and  unpredictable. The story kicks right into high gear when a super-model and  her female acquaintance are found murdered at a party with a large number  of guests as possible suspects.  The suspects range from the parents (whose  lives revolve around their super-model daughter's life, a fundamentalist  preacher (her brother), a fashion photographer, an artist/potter/lover , a  banker, and a drug dealer, just to name a few. The number of suspects alone  keeps you &quot;on your toes.&quot;  If you have read other books in this  series you may find this book a bit short on the depth of Lucas Davenport  in certain areas, but you will still enjoy this novel.  The main difference  is that this book had a quicker put together feel than the others.  After  reading this one, you will want to definitely read the other Prey novels  from Sanford!!	2000-09-04

It tells a story of a family, through  three generations. It is an unwrapping of a family history and the secrets  there in. The beginning is during the civil war, when a wounded soldier  from New Hampshire is helped by a young girl, an escaped slave from North  Carolina. They travel to New Hampshire and on the way fall in love and  marry.  The people of this novel are so well crafted that you feel you  almost know them and yet there always parts that are hidden away.  In one  scene in the novel, someone says &quot;A man is the sum of his parts.&quot;  Foster answers,&quot;Maybe,.. I don't know.  Seems to me though, the last  one who could do that sum would be the one involved.&quot;  He is  told,&quot;...everyman is at least two men.  One of them known only to  himself.&quot;  That is how the characters evolve, there seem to be real  dimensions that you catch only a glimmer of and other facets that are laid  wide open. The story is strong and provocative, and thoroughly captures the  reader. The generations are woven gently and not so gently through out each  other, creating a wondrous and stunningly intelligent work. The fabulous  part is that you really think that you know what is coming next and then it  doesn't.  A casual yet brilliant conversation in this novel says everything  about the author. Someone says,&quot;...You know exactly what [the words]  are.  You just don't want to say them for fear you'd be wrong.&quot;  Foster answers,&quot;I'm not sure it's worry about being wrong so much as  wanting to get things right.&quot;  Well Mr. Lent, you got it right, very  right!!	2000-08-31

It was very funny and very touching in parts as well.  This is the tale of a girl (told in a series of short stories)from  childhood to her adulthood who like everyone, searches in her own way for  an understanding of love and life and friendship.  She is a wonderful  observer of others in her life while trying to pick up clues on how one  goes about this &quot;hunting and fishing&quot; for answers to lifes most  precious desire, love and acceptance. She tries to learn from her older  brother, from her parents, from her friends and even from bosses and  ex-boyfriends.  This is a wonderfully written work that brings it's  character to full living color.  I loved the humor of this book, although I  think anyone under thirty might miss the finer points.  The emotional  scenes when her father becomes ill made me weep, and really think about my  parents and ther health,(especialy my Mom's chronic health)  This is a  terrific book, and even if you are a younger(under thirty) reader you will  love it, because it will strike home at some point in Jane's life.	2000-08-21

In hurricane terms, this book would be a category 5, catastrophic damage  to any idea that hurricanes are not potentially deadly.  This was an  amazing account of the 1900 hurricane that slammed into Galveston, causing  unimaginable death and destruction.  This book came to my attention after  reading Isaac's Storm, a book about the same hurricane.  While that book  was very good, this was even better.  The author interviewed survivors of  this storm, and the stories are amazingly frank and clear.  When told  through the eyes of so many survivors the book takes on a life of it's own.  While it does document an event, it never dry or dull.  It brings the power  of a hurricane to reality and helps the reader to realize that this power  is not something that man can control.  To realize that predicting the  weather has made such a giant leap forward from 1900 may lead people to be  complacent in the face of a hurricane,but read this and you will never feel  that way again.  The descriptions of the sounds and the level of noise were  vivid and made me clearly remember the category three hurricane I went  through with my family a few years ago.  This should be required reading  for anyone who lives along the coast, and even inland where hurricane  damage can still be catastrophic.  Mother Nature deserves respect, and if  you don't give it to her.......well.......read the book!!	2000-08-21

This is the story of the actual events that inspired  Herman Melville to create his novel, Moby Dick. In the Heart of the Sea is  the story of the whaling industry in Nantucket, as well as the culture of  the people of Nantucket. Most of all it is a story of how men faced with  what seems to be insurmountable odds against them, strive with everything  in their heart and soul to survive and return home. The lengths these men  of the sea would go to and the actions they are forced to choose between  were stunning. The author describes their physical and mental condition as  their situation plays out and you realize what a super-human effort even  the smallest necessary task was to perform. To fight when your body has  nothing to draw upon or to surrender yourself at that point, these are the  decisions they must weigh. The author recreates the emotions at each point  in their journey. From the ramming of the ship, when the men cannot believe  what is happening, to their isolation on the sea, thousands of miles from  the nearest land in small boats and a meager supply of survival supplies,  to their arrival on an island, only to realize they cannot survive for long  there either. The documentation of the starvation process from other  situations (concentration camps, remote crash sights, etc.) provide a  crystal clear story of what these men were experiencing. While the first  chapter or so did not pull me into the story, suddenly I was swept up in  the lives of these whalers and could not put this book down. If you want to  read about the sea or what men can overcome when life is in the balance,  this is a vivid tale, tragic, heroic and stunning.	2000-08-16

This book was fascinating because of the details of the super storm, and  how the three weather events collided to form the perfect storm. The  writing was very different, the style was basic. This is not a criticism. I  think that the style reflects the lives of the fisherman, blunt, honest and  not elegant, but very real. To put this story together in this manner from  the actual documented facts was a difficult task at best, but this book  does it well. The lives of the people involved are a bit abrupt at times,  again a reflection of the people involved. It gives a feel for their  mindset, and then goes on to detail what it was like for all of them as  this storm gathered around them, and showed them natures fury. I am always  fascinated by weather, especially on the ocean, and after going through  several hurricanes, one a category three, my respect for nature increases  as does my desire to know more. This was a good book. I see that many  reviewers did not like the style of writing and felt there was a lack of  editing, but I felt the style commented on the peoples life-at-sea story.  This book is well worth reading.	2000-08-07

In coming to terms with all that is going on she shares her  lowcountry upbringing  on Sullivans Island in South Carolina, during the  racially tumultuous 60's and 70's.  Her mother neglects the children,  feeling overwhelmed by the responsibilities of motherhood and an abusive  husband.  The children are instead raised by Livvie, a woman hired by  Susan's father to look after &quot;everything&quot;. Livvie takes charge  and gives the children her heart and soul.  Livvie teaches them about  life  and faith, in good and in bad times.  This is a tale of coming to terms  with who you are, how you got there and recognizing the past for what it  was.

While this book was a hard starter,(it took nearly 140 pages until I seriously cared what came next) I have to say it is definitely worth it. The story of a missionary family going to the Congo during a turbulent  period in history was extremely interesting. One of the fascinating aspects  to the whole story is that it makes you look at &quot;wants and needs&quot;  in life with a completely different perspective from each character in the  novel, and then in one's own life. It takes you into the lives of the  native Congolese people in a small village,their everyday needs and how  they view the missionary families. Each of the characters has such a  different perspective on what is going on, it is like piecing a puzzle  together, and ending up with a picture that wasn't like the one on the box.  Very interesting,very compelling. Not a quick read obviously, but very well  worth your time.	2000-07-05

It is the story of a  young teacher named Summer who moves in with her dying brother to help care  for him.  Their parents live on a farm nearby and are taking care of the  grandmother who has cancer. The story intertwines all the characters so  beautifully, and each person is so real, so well developed that the story  takes root in your heart. It deals with prejudices, and reverse prejudice  (hating someone because they hate you) and seeing beyond those feelings to  the humanity of each person.  It is an uplifting story,(even though I cried  through many parts,) and it was impossible to not continue reading this.

If you are unfamiliar with this author, this book would be an interesting introduction to the Dave Robicheaux novels by Burke. Burke writes with all five senses in mind.  The descriptions of the Southern Louisiana will make  you thirst for a sweet tea.  The plot revolves around a possible serial  murderer of young girls. It also involves the mafia infiltrating his locale  through a Hollywood movie making event.  The two may be connected.  When  Dave Robicheaux begins to see Confederate soldiers, and has conversations  with them, you wonder, was it Dave Robicheaux' car accident, was it  alcohol, or has Mr. Burke opted for a science fantasy turn of events.

Wild Decembers is the story of three people and the Irish mountainside they reluctantly have to share.  This is a classic tragedy, full of deep love, and heartbreaking drama.  Love of people, love of the land and love of family...and how far the limits will be pushed to possess these are the elements that weave this tale.  A brother Joseph, and sister, Breege, live quietly until a man from Australia, Bugler, arrives to lay claim to his deceased Uncles' land.  The men argue and go to battle over boundaries, as Breege slowly falls in love with Bugler, leading to an obvious clash of loyalties for all.  The descriptions of the land read like poetry.  The people are complete and full of heart and soul.  You know what they are going to do and you understand why, even if you would not agree with their actions.  The artistry of O'Brien is that you are able to maintain hope that somehow the outcome will be different.  Among O'Briens memorable cast are the wild sisters Rita and Reena who are nothing that you would expect.  The story is beautifully sad and classically told.	2000-05-11

The main character Elizabeth is a very focused, honest, caring  person.  She says what needs to be said and does the things that need to be  done. She is very observant of peoples personalities and what drives them,  at least she believes she is until she meets Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy.  That  the daughters must marry due to their impending financial  situation  is never questioned, but who will the future husbands be?  What makes Mr.  Right, Mr. Right?  How can one sister's Mr. Right be so wrong for everyone  else but her?  With all the social customs and duties is it possible that  two people can actually find each other, fall in love and marry? There are  characters you will love and characters you will love to hate. It is filled  with humor,romance and drama, and enough twists and turns to create a  wonderful and very enjoyable story.	2000-05-06

Living in North Carolina and going through hurricanes Fran and Floyd, along with several smaller hurricanes, I found this book fascinating.  It tells the story of the development of a super killer hurricane through the  eyes of a man who does the best he can with the scientific knowledge  available.  To see the change in weather forecasting from then until now is  amazing.  To understand the unpredictability of storms even in this day and  age is frightening.  The devastation wrought by this storm is so  completely thorough,and the author does a superior job of rendering a  picture that the reader can grasp. The actual historical perspective,  blended with the memories of Isaac should cause everyone to understand that  nature has  uncontrollable power and deserves our respect.  Anyone who  lives in an area where there is possible hurricane activity should read  this book and then learn to prepare and plan for an eventual hurricane. The  devastation of Floyd went way beyond the immediate coastline where most  people think the main damage occurs.  Since then the National Hurricane  Center has realized that new ratings for damage potential  and water  amounts need to be developed.  As &quot;weather smart&quot; as the people  of Isaac's time thought they were, are we not as smuggly self assured as  they were.  Storms can do unexpected things no matter how closely they are  monitored.  This was an excellent book about how mother nature doesn't have  a trip itinerary, but moves as her spirit strikes.	2000-05-06

US	51112341	R4PDBDUIDEOWF	006019491X	694565872	Daughter of Fortune: A Novel	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Enjoyable story	This story was an enjoyable one.  The main character begins life with many strikes against her.  She seems to go through life as a careful observer, but when she decides to partake in life, makes several bad choices, leading  to life changing situations.  It is her hitting rock-bottom and taking  charge of her own life, along with her good fortune in finding a strong  clear headed friend, that allow her to grow and mature into a very  responsible, caring, intelligent person. I really liked the way this novel  ended, no spoon feeding the reader a sappy, happily ever-after end, but  allowing the reader to really think about the characters and their possible  future(s).  Our book club, (Bunny's Book Club) discussed the different  versions of endings we had come up with, and there were several  possibilities. Each had merit and everyone enjoyed this novel.  The  overviews of Chilean and Goldrush life were enjoyable.  The racial and  ethnic clashes were openly pictured.  The portrayal of the media as giving  the people what they want, true or not, was interesting and as true today  as it appeared then.  While some of the characters could have been  fleshed out a bit more, this does not detract from this wonderful story.	2000-04-14

Having been married at the age of 19 and married for 24 years, I thought this book might not be as fun a read as for a singleton,  BUT IT IS!  While many women have the insecurities and concerns that are expressed in this book (there is probably a bit of Bridget Jones in every woman) to read them  in this format was laugh-out-loud funny. This was a very enjoyable book, it  leaves you smiling.	2000-04-03

A group of four friends receive their last orders to take a friend's ashes to scatter at the beach.  Their journey to do this provides the time for the rest of the  men to remember their past, their experiences, and to think about where  they are in their lives now.  This is beautifully written, humorous and  poignant.  When it is over you will still be thinking about it and about  your own life too.  It is a British book and it may take a while to fall  into the rhythms and patterns of expression, but it is well worth it.  Heart-warming and soul touching, a brilliant novel.	2000-03-27
US	51112341	R1ZY2Z2YTCJ9PQ	0375406182	963629300	Plainsong	Books	4	3	3	N	N	plain wonderful	In his novel Plainsong, Kent Haruf manages to gently enter the lives of several people in a small Colorado town. Kent Haruf writes in a wonderful unembellished style that paints a picture in your heart. The story involves  the falling apart ,salvaging and rebuilding of families.  It defines what  really does make a family a family. The story involves a high school  teacher , his two young sons and the emotionally unavailable wife and  mother.  There are the Macpheron brothers (two older bachelor farmers) and  an abandoned 17 year old pregnant high school student.  The weaver of the  fabric of this story is an unmarried teacher named  Maggie. She shows true  compassion and understanding and reweaves these &quot;families&quot;. The  story moves gently and beautifully and pulls you right in. Plainsong is a  true joy to read.	2000-03-20

This story also brings to light the problem of too much political correctness  in todays society and how it could unintentionally  alter the path of justice.  Harry Bosch walks his own path to ensure  justice is done.  As always Michael Connelly doesn't let you down, after  reading this you will appreciate his style and ability, and intricacies of  developing his character with each new book.	2000-03-20

This book takes an upclose,  in your face look at terrorism here in the United States. It brings home the real possibilities that exist and makes you wonder, not if,  but when.  Another  important aspect of this novel was to bring home the  fact that terrorists are intelligent, unlike some people seem to want to  believe.  This was a fast paced story, and while the ending may have  dissapointed some, I believe any other ending would have detracted from the  plausibility of this tale. Great book, great read! If you already love  Demille don't miss this one.  If you have never read Demille, now is the  time to begin!	2000-03-20

Having a female leading character was enjoyable.  I like her toughness, and her ability to handle rough situations with brains, using  any available resource, from weapons to exhusband mafia family/pals. Don't  let the  similarities between Sunny and Spenser deter you from reading  this. It was a fun read.	2000-03-20

This story is so beautifully written, it engages your senses of sight, touch and smell so overwhelmingly that you could swear you were there.  This is a story of a small Washington village, the internment of the  Japanese, and the effects of love and prejudice on all involved.  The  author does not spoon feed you every little detail but draws you into the  village to experience the lives of these people and to come to your own  judgements about the  hows and the whys of what happened. The pace of the  courtroom scenes mirrors the resignation of the man on trial, that  &quot;What will happen will happen&quot;, and for me this emphasized the  emotional aspects of the story rather than detracted from it. This was an  excellent book.  It caused me to do some further research on the subject of  the Japanese internment camps, and to find out that not one person of  Japanese ancestry was ever convicted of espionage during this time.  When  an author has the ability to inspire others to look into the past from an  historical perspective that says a lot!	2000-03-20

It is funny and poignant and at times irritating to  read the choices that he makes.  His honesty in his memoir is blunt and he  seems to hide nothing from the reader.  He includes so many bad  choices(that many would have shied away from revealing) that you can't help  but respect his openess about his life. We aren't intended to judge him,  but to peek into his life and to see how we are shaped by events and  choices in our own lives, in the short and the long term.  It may also make  us look with a bit more compassion on those around us whose lives we  &quot;just don't get!&quot; and to appreciate the blessings we receive no  matter how small.	2000-03-09

It gave such a clear picture of the world in that moment in time.  It would have been a great read even if every word had been total fiction. That this was a real story of young men chasing  their dreams, working hard and reaching literally for the stars made it  truely wonderful.  Growing up in West Virginia made it closer to my heart.  Being in a military family helped me to see the &quot;company town&quot;  line of thought.  As always this was so much better than the movie!  Everyone who has borrowed this  has loved it!	2000-03-03

The story of a missionary family going to the Congo during a turbulent  period in history was extremely interesting. One of the fascinating aspects  to the whole story is that it makes you look at &quot;wants and needs&quot;  in life with a completely different perspective from each  character in the  novel, and then in one's own life.  It takes you into the lives of the  native Congolese people in a small village,their everyday needs and how  they view the missionary families. Each of the characters has such a  different perspective on what is going on, it is like piecing a puzzle  together, and ending up with a picture that wasn't like the one on the box.  Very interesting,very compelling.  Not a quick read obviously, but very  well worth your time.	2000-02-22

She never quit or gave up on anything,whether it was &quot;fair&quot; or not, hard or easy. She rarely worried about the opinions of others. She did what needed to be done.  Instead of running back home to momma or just running  off to look for an easier life, she kept her commitments. She actually  understood what commitment meant and was willing to give whatever it took,  no limits. She was a truly grounded woman and always approached situations  with her faith, her heart and  a big dose of reality. She spent little time  worrying on things that she couldn't change. She had seen life and death  and knew that life continued on no matter what happened, and there was no  sense in just giving up and quitting. Julie was a person who lived in the  present moment and did the very best she could each day.  She never had her  head in the clouds dreaming, but she enjoyed and experienced life to it's  absolute totality. She was a truly inspiring, strong, Southern woman, and I  loved her story.	2000-02-04
