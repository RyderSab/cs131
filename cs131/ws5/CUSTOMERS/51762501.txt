He is the greatest living theologian in the world and this book continues to confirm this in my mind. When I understand him I am dumbfounded by his words. He discussion of our world being ruled by our fear of death has changed my life. How can we really live when even Christians fear death? For example - at one time in history our society was intimately involved with the dead. If you died your family would be the ones who took care of you, prepared you for burial, and then buried in the center of town by the church where everyone would be reminded of your life. Now if you are dying we place you in a hospital and even there move you away from the other patients into an I.C.U., once you die we give your body to someone else (a mortician) to take care of it and prepare it for burial, and then we bury you on the outskirts of town where we can forget about you. We are scared of death and that keeps us from living. Of course, his discussion on the four positions of prayer is also very good. This is one of his easier to read works but it is still excellent.	2003-03-08

When I had Dr. Erickson for Systematic Theology in seminary the cover of this book was green and it was affectionately referred to as &quot;the green monster.&quot; It was big and intimidating. I bought the book and began my forced, daily readings of it. I found that this monster was gentle and fascinating. Dr. Erickson covers all the sides of the doctrines he discusses and yet does not fail to define where he falls on them. His writing style is such that he is able to make the deepest issues understandable for anyone willing to put a little time into the book. While, the book is not the book I would recommend for someone with no previous theological reading, it is one that I would say needs to be in the collection of anyone seriouesly interested in systematic theology.	2001-07-11

Jones' &quot;History of Western Philosophy&quot; series is the cream of the crop when it comes to philosophical surveys. Dr. Jones covers all the main thinkers of a given time and attempts to present their thoughts from the original author's perspective. He does this by non-judgementally discussing each thinker and by allow the reader to read long excerpts of the original author's work. You get a very good flavor of the thoughts of the time period and of the struggles that went on in between each thinker.<br />This is true of &quot;Hobbes to Hume&quot; just as it is of all the other books of the series. I appreciate the fact that Dr. Jones presents these incredible thinkers work in a manner that is not derogatory to the educated reader but is not beyond the comprehension of the beginner (there is a superb glossary). The investment in this book (and the rest of those in the series) are well worth it for anyone who wants to understand why we think the way we do.	2001-07-11

Dr. McGrath writes in an easy to read manner but does not water down his subject to the point that it is meaningless. &quot;Christian Spirituality&quot; is a wonderful summary of spirituality and places a great deal of emphasis on spirituality within theology.

Lewis). I read this &quot;children's&quot; fantasy as an adult and immediately fell in love with Tolkien's writing. This is fantasy that has depth to it. Yes, there are goblins, and elves, and dwarves in the book but it is not just a fantasy that just throws out shallow fantasy characters. Tolkien makes you understand the characters and makes you want to be a part of their lives. Even though they are creatures of fantasy you will begin to fel for them just like you would the characters of any great book. Though some call this is a &quot;children's&quot; book it was well worth my time and I will begin to read the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; series simply because of how good &quot;the Hobbit&quot; was.	2001-06-23

My opening thought was \\"with its title this the book is going to be  a joke.\\" Boy was I wrong. First off, nothing by Gordan Fee is a joke.  Second, this small book is one of the best sources on biblical  interpretation in the world right now. Third, it is an easy to understand  book, yet it does not skimp on the details of biblical exegesis. After my  first time through \\"How to Read the Bible ...\\" I realized that this was a  book that I could recommend to anyone wanting to know more about how to  read the Bible and understand every word. The book is not condescending to  scholars but is still understandable to those that do not have a  theological background. I was a \\"title snob\\" and this book proved me wrong.	2000-09-05

As a break I picked the book up and then  spent the rest of my free time trying to perfect my juggling. The book  really can teach any able bodied person to juggle. The techniques are clear  and concise and the humor is, well, really cony, but it does add to the  overall feel of the book. Pictures would have probably been nicer than the  drawings that Klutz decided to use, but again the drawings are part of the  \\"feel\\" of the book. The book takes you a little past basic juggling but not  much. It's goal is to quickly teach you how to juggle and it does this very  effectively. In my case I learned how to juggle and still passed my finals.	2000-09-04

In his usual style of challenging thought Tony Campolo takes on the seven  deadly sins and relates them to modern, western culture. Today it seems as  though very few people are willing to openly talk about sin and call it  what it is ... SIN. That is what Campolo does. He covers the sins by giving  broad and specific examples of them, helping you to understand how you  might actually struggle with these sins, and then helps you to develop a  strategy to overcome these sins through the grace of Christ. I don't want  to call it refreshing to be convicted over my own pride or gluttony, but it  was very different from much of the other Christian writing out there that  seems to focus on &quot;self-help&quot; instead of repentance. Campolo does  an excellent job of continuing to point to our (and his own) short comings  and then pointing to the unmerited favor of our loving God.	2000-08-25

In &quot;Pastoral Counseling&quot; he specifically deals with the &quot;unescapable priveldge&quot; of pastoral counseling. He offers  theorectical and practical helps to the reader by discussing the tensions  that consistently are a part of pastoral counseling (such as, involving a  theological or scientific approach to counseling, the private versus public  ministry, being aggresive versus passive in counseling). These tensions are  what ministers face everyday and they effect counseling just as much as  they do any other part of a pastor's ministry. Dr. Oates helps the reader  consider these tensions and then work towards a considered approach to  pastoral counseling. That's why this book is a valuable resource for any  minister or lay-pastor.	2000-06-07

I personally make it  available to all my teachers because of its simple ideas that consistently  make teachers better. The ideas aren't anything ground breaking but they do  show how simple changes can get a teacher excited about teaching and when  that happens you will have a class that is excited about learning. There  are at least 50 practical programs spread through the book, but I believe  its greatest assest is the fact that this book stresses why it is so  important for teachers to be creative. The book also makes practical  suggestions on how teachers can make themselves more creative (such as,  always carry a notepad around and write down any idea you have, etc.) If  you want some inspiration and a few good ideas read this book.	2000-06-07

It's title tells the truth. The book is obviously written for the beginning fly-fisher but that does not mean it is light-weight in its  information. Rutter &amp; Card give very solid information and explain it  throughly enough for it to become easy to understand. The book is full of  black and white pictures and diagrams to help the reader visualize what the  writers are talking about. They will explain what you need to do and then  show you pictures of how to do it. The Table of Contents is also a big help  because it breaks down where you can find each sub-grouping within each  chapter (the Table of Contents is almost as big as the Index).

Our communication with God should be lively and active, yet too often it is a drudgery. Joyce Huggett uses &quot;Praying the Parables&quot;  to introduce readers to new (or merely often forgotten) methods of prayer.  Instead of merely tell God about your requests Joyce Huggett suggests  specific ways of contemplating on the parables of Jesus that lead to  prayers of honesty. These prayers are more aboutknowing God better than  they are about lifting requests to God. She suggests many different methods  of prayer. These vary from assuming the parts of certain parables, to  spiritual stock-taking, to journalling, and many other methods. These  methods may be new to some and old hat to others, but Joyce Huggett's  application of them is refreshing.	2000-06-06

In a  time period where there seems to be very few ministers who are willing to  speak against the unpopular social evils of our society Dr. Sider's book  stands out as a message of truth. Instead of fearing the result of telling  &quot;Rich Christians&quot; (which most of us are within America) that they  (we) have to live different if they are going to follow the commands of  their Lord, Sider speaks this message boldly. This book is not an easy  read, in that I was convicted of my own failings as I read each chapter.  Yet, this book has a message that is very important for Christians to  understand. We have to live lifestyles to take care of the needy. We have  to put their needs before our own.

It is no wonder that some many  seminaries and colleges are using &quot;Christian Theology&quot; as their  Systematic Theology text book. &quot;Christian Theology&quot; is not a new  Systematic Theology, and Dr. McGrath does not introduce a new principle on  which he could build a theology (that is not the purpose of this book).  Rather, in his characteristically easy to read style, he surveys what has  happened within theology and prepares the reader to begin reading further  within theology.	2000-06-03
