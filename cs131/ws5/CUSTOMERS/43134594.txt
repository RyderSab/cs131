Does this make me seem pretentious and rather smart-allecky?  Yes.  But I just had to write a response to the previous review.  I wholeheartedly understand how someone who reads books merely for story's sake would not enjoy this book; there's not much of a story.  But to read Barth's later works for simply this reason is wherein the fallacy lies.  You see, Barth is the master (as far as I'm concerned) of literary gymnastics and narrative techniques.  If you enjoy literature qua literature, then you'll like this.  The first twenty pages alone (which the first reviewer claimed were boring) blew my mind for the sheer technique.  Surely this book is not for everyone, it's actually for a very small number of people, but please don't criticize it for not being &quot;standard&quot; like, say, Larry McMurty.<br />And if you just read a book for the storyline with no appreciation for the literary merits, why not just waste less time and go see a movie?  (Oh yeah, I almost forgot how much you like to claim that reading is more rewarding than watching movies.)	2002-04-14

Bergson provides very interesting criticisms of empiricism and rationalism as well as interesting solutions to these problems.  Bergson is one of the more intriguing of 20th Century Philosophers and I found this work enjoyable enough to recommend it to anyone with an interest in AND knowledge of the subject.  However, if you are looking for an ACTUAL introduction to metaphysics, look elsewhere.  Might I suggest starting with Aristotle?	2001-11-09

It is certainly my favorite of the comedies and I do not hesitate to rank this as one of the greatest works of literature of all-time.  By the way, I LOVE this play.  Oh yeah, have I mentioned that...well enough of that.  &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; is one of the funniest plays of all-time.  I was literally laughing out loud during the performance of &quot;The Most Lamentable Comedy...&quot; at the play's end.  The &quot;dream&quot; world within the forest is a magical fantasy world in which the humans are manipulated by faries to fall in or out of love.  Within this world, in which most of the play occurs, the powers of the imagination are heightened and the characters are helpless against their imaginations, which guide everything they do and say.  This is one of the play's major themes: the imagination.  Even out of the &quot;dream world&quot; the characters are guided by their imaginations.  Duke Theseus (the plays strongest critic of such a notion) even admits that in order to enjoy such a performance (as the one put on by the unforgettable Bottom, and his comrades-in-folly), one must use one's imagination.  I honestly believe that this is Shakespeare at his best.  I would recommend this work to anyone!	2001-10-20

However, what he DID do is set the foundation for over two thousand years of thought.  Read this work slowly; within each of the seemingly-simple discussions there is a world of though to be discovered.  Anyone with the least bit of background in philosophical readings can literally read page-by-page, discovering the sources of many of the greatest philosophers of all-time.  The &quot;Republic&quot; is not so much a work of literature as it is an explosion of thought; a ten-book brainstorm of one of the greatest minds of all-time.  By the work's end, whether or not you feel Socrates to have successfully answered Glaucon's challenge is almost irrelevant, for the argument will have already left your mind reeling.	2001-10-20

Come on, it's worth five stars just for the three scenes with Dogberry (Shakespeare's greatest clown???).  However, the rest of the play is brilliant as well.  Some people read it as a straightforward love story.  However, I am not sure whether or not any of the characters are REALLY in love with each other or not.  I've read it as a commentary on society (as I've read many of the comedies).  I think that the play is about how our lives are shaped by gossip and the opinions we believe others to have of us.  Notice how both Benedick and Beatrice mention how others will perceive them if they do not requite the others &quot;love&quot; for him/her.  I think it is a commentary on the flaws of placing so much emphasis on propriety and manner and the power of words in shaping our lives.  But then again, that's just me.  Whether or not you (or anyone for that matter...(gulp!)...or am I really alone???) read this play the same way, you should find much enjoyment in it and I therefore recommend it highly.	2001-10-20

Simply put, it is the best work of one of the best authors of this century.  It is also probably the greatest novella of this, or any, century.  Since many reviewers have already outlined the plot (and pretty much everyone should already know it for the most part) I will not do so.  I also will not write in this review what I feel the major themes of the work are because I believe the most enjoyable thing about reading and re-reading works such as this is discovering the themes for oneself.  All I'll say is that &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is well worth the hype.  There are those who claim it is racist and this is a view which probably cannot be disproved by the text.  However, I do not agree with it.  Approach this work with an open mind.  What Conrad describes is universal.  So is this book's impact.	2001-10-20
US	43134594	R2SY19ZAG1I19L	0671722778	43217624	Merchant of Venice (Folger Shakespeare Library)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Ouch!	This play can be read as anti-semitic.  In fact, it's pretty hard to defend it from such charges.  Shylock is a pretty rotten character and the fact that he is jewish is difficult to overlook (particularly since the other characters mention it on pretty much EVERY page).  However, I think it is important to mention that the &quot;heroes&quot; of this play do not necessarily have to be interpreted as heroes.  They are by no means perfect and there are many subtle (and some not-so-subtle) instances within the text in which their biases against ANYONE unlike them is illustrated.  If one reads the play this way, then Shylock becomes more of a tragic figure rather than an absolutely heartless villain.  I don't know.  My feelings about this are mixed.  There are a few funny parts of this play and the language is, as always, beautiful.  The theme of putting a price on human beings is one which has been explored numerous times since.  Overall, it is enjoyable, but perhaps not so much so as some of the other comedies.  Do not read this play without having read a few others by Shakespeare first.  It is an excellent play, but not his best and not his most enjoyable either.	2001-10-20
US	43134594	R2F21VZRSVK343	0671722565	43217624	As You Like It	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Magical!	&quot;As You Like It&quot; is bar none, one of Shakespeare's VERY best works.  It is probably the most poetic of the comedies and contains perhaps as many famous quotations as any other of his plays.  Rosalind is perhaps his greatest female character and this work, along with the equally (or even more) brilliant &quot;Midsummer Night's Dream,&quot; is the best example of Shakespeare's theme of the &quot;dream world&quot; vs. the &quot;real&quot; world.  This play, especially the scenes in the forest, is a celebration of language and the power of the freedom of the imagination.  It consequently can be read as a criticism of the &quot;real world,&quot; here represented by Duke Ferdinand's court.  Like many of the other comedies, Shakespeare is mocking the &quot;ideal&quot; which many in his society would have praised.  Though this play deals with some pretty dark themes (which of his plays doesn't?) it is a light-hearted and fully enjoyable read!	2001-10-20

However, it is STILL a must-read for anyone who loves literature.  There seems to be some prevalent opinion that Shakespeare's language is boring and cannot be humorous.  Anyone who thinks that has not read this play.  Just because a work requires thought does not mean that it is boring.  The early exchanges between Pettruchio and Katherine are about as witty as anything you will ever read and so are many of the others episodes within this play.  Some claim that this work is sexist.  Though they are certainly entitled to this opinion, I would have to disagree with it.  Compare the induction to the play's body.  More specifically, compare what happens to Sly to what happens to Katherine.  What the play, atleast in my own humble opinion, is about is how language, the manner in which we are treated, and (seriously) the clothes we wear affect how we think of ourselves and, consequently, how we act.  Think about it and then go outside, watch the way people dress, hear the way they talk, and then go back inside, build a shrine to Shakespeare and memorize all his works.  Ok, well maybe I wasn't serious about the last part, but if you read many of The Bard's works, you will discover not only their beauty, but their relevance to society, even four-hundred years later.	2001-10-20

However, it is nontheless an interesting literary experiment that is well worth reading. I would recommend another of his works for those unfamiliar with his style, perhaps &quot;White Noise&quot; or &quot;Libra,&quot; but for those of you who ARE familiar with DeLillo, this should be an enjoyable, albeit brief, read.	2001-07-24

Infamous for its level of difficulty, one thing this book is not, is unreadable. This book can be read, and understood, so long as the reader suspend any belief that every word, page, chapter, or episode can be completely understood. Some episodes make almost no sense at all, and the book does not follow anything resembling a straightforward plot, but in the book's sprawling eccentricity, the luminosity of genius is everpresent. It seems almost pointless to try to draw any comparisons or analogies to any other work of art of any genre, because &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot; is one of a kind. The book is not for everyone and I would recommend that someone interested in Pynchon's works read &quot;V.&quot; or &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; before tackling &quot;Gravity's Rainbow.&quot;  Thomas Pynchon is unlike almost any other author and certainly unlike the authors who comprise Best Seller Lists, however if one approaches his works with an open mind, there is much enjoyment to be gotten out of them.<br />Why criticise something for being exceptional?	2001-07-24

His characters are as memorable as any ever created, and perhaps no play better demonstrates his humorous capabilities that &quot;Tartuffe,&quot; which is as light-hearted in the face of somber themes as anything ever written.

So much more than a mere &quot;romance&quot; novel, it is also one of the most humorous works of fiction ever written, rife with some of literature's most memorable and beloved characters.  &quot;Emma&quot; remains my favorite of Austen's books and is a testament to my opinion that she is one of the greatest novelists of all-time, male or female.	2001-07-23

Though it does bring up many excellent and rather disturbing points, it is at times a bit redundant.  It reads more like a mediocre translation of a great book than a great book in itself.  The premises of this book are far greater than the prose which illuminates them.  I'd still recommend this book to those with an interest in the subject matter, but I think there are other works which communicate the ideas more poignantly.	2001-07-23

For those who are interested in taking their first leap into the Tolstoy ouvre, perhaps it is better to start with a shorter work.  I would suggest this one, because despite its brevity, it packs as powerful a wallop as anything else he wrote.	2001-07-23

Kafka, along with Dostoevsky and Thomas Mann, is one of the writers who captured the sublime and humane in their works of the sorrow and inhumanity of the world.  &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; displays this uncanny ability and remains one of the classic short stories of the twentieth, or any other, century.  When one finishes this book, or just about any other of Kafka's, one feels cleansed by the cathartic effect of the work.  This author, and this work, are one of a kind.	2001-07-23

Like Pynchon's &quot;V&quot;., the main characters in &quot;White Noise&quot; are intentionally bland and invariant, save for the emigre professors, who are quite memorable, in order to show how commercial consumerism has affected our nation and its citizens. Some complain that there is no &quot;story&quot; in &quot;White Noise,&quot; but sometimes it takes less to show more.  If DeLillo had turned this novel into a screenplay-de jour, he would be undermining the book's theme.  If the reader can suspend expectations of a typical plot or storyline, &quot;White Noise&quot; will prove to be deliciously disturbing.	2001-07-23

True: he is not for everyone, but you learn how to read the great writers as you go, and Faulkner is no exception.  &quot;As I Lay Dying,&quot; is very somber in tone, but ridiculously humorous at the same time, which throws many people off because they do not realize it is supposed to be humorous as well.  If one approaches it with an open mind, they will learn to love it.  Great Literature is not supposed to be spoon-fed.	2001-07-23

Many of our most cherished institutions are a result of Marxist thought, the problem is that the manifesto is a bit idealistic.  Once the bourgeosie overthrows the proletariat, what's to stop the leaders from becoming a new proletariat?  Also, Karl Marx wasn't much of a writer but, perhaps due to its influence, &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; isn't nearly as exhausing as some of his subsequent writings.	2001-07-23

The basis of his subsequent masterpieces, to call &quot;Notes from the Underground&quot; dark and disturbing is like calling King Kong &quot;ape-like.&quot;  It is often considered a cornerstone of existential thought, which is apt, because Dostoevsky was nearly as important to existentialism as Kierkegaard or Sartre.  His characters, particularly the &quot;anti-hero&quot; character prevalent in his works, were perhaps the most original and unique to be created since the time of Shakespeare and Cervantes.  Modern literature is almost unthinkable without Dostoevksy's contributions, most of which originated in this novella.	2001-07-23
