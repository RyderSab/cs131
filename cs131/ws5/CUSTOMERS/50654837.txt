While reading the book, I found the minimal characterization and description rather annoying, e.g. how did the protagonist actually feel when he saw his cousin all cleaned up and dressed up, other than that \\"I almost did not recognize her\\"? In the end, however, I ended up appreciating that the most powerful experience or emotion in one's life are often hidden and unexpressed. At the end of the book, what exactly went thru the cousin's mind at the cemetary are left completely to reader's imagination and, as a result, the stunning impact of this book continues long after reading is done. This has to be one of the most thought-provoking books I've read in my life. It's unfortunate, though, the lack of a sophisticated literary style will prevent it from becoming an immortal classic (e.g. Wharton's \\"Age of Innocence\\"). This book had a great potential to be truly extraordinary, but fell just short. It's still a very good book.  Also recommended:  Ambrose's \\"Band of Brothers\\". <br />	2004-10-13

Sandy Weill, for example, fails that test miserably, since he cares nothing for his company or its employees, and only about feeding his insatiable appetite for personal profit, self-aggrandizement, and great food, in that order.  Weill is an example of the so-called celebrity leaders who are very reluctant to groom and name their successors, since they care far more about holding onto their power than for the longer-term welfare of the company and its employees.  The last thing you'd see these quasi-leaders do is sacrifice their power or money for longer benefit of the company.  Eisner is another perfect example of Emperor-CEO who got paid obscene amount of money and drove out top talents from Disney, while its business and stock prices languished badly.<br />A perfect business book - erudite, entertaining, and relevant - and a must-read for anyone who ever dreamed of becoming (or simply working for) the true business leader.	2004-07-15

Langley tries mightily to cast Weill as a 'David' going up against the WASP 'Goliath' and winning, and omits the obvious and profound hypocrisy of Weill:<br />-  Despite Weill's emphasis on stock options - not cash - as financial incentives for his employees, Weill himself became the highest and most overpaid CEO by getting the slavish board to grant him obscene amounts of CASH for his compensation.<br />-  Weill and Dimon are responsible for laying off tens of thousands of people in their career, and their ruthlessness are in full display in Langley's book.  As the saying goes, cruel people are equally sentimental.  The depth of self-pity of Weill and Dimon when they themselves get fired are simply revolting in their hypocrisy and self-righteousness.<br />-  Weill's monstrous capacity for decadent self-indulgence is biblical in its scale.  While becoming hysterical against employee benefits that are measured in pennies, he gets equally hysterical when faced with scrutiny of his fleet of corporate jets, ironically by his right-hand man, Jamie Dimon.<br />Weill is a modern day equivalent of the rail road and oil robber barons of the last century, i.e. megalomanic monsters who squeeze every penny out of his employees to expand his empire, and then spends the money to re-cast himself as a pioneer, benefactor and philanthropist.<br />Langley had to make many compromises in order to get access to Weill's world and played right into his hand.  In the last 100 pages of her book, the author appears to be increasingly star struck, focusing on the lavish lifestyle and adulation of an aging tycoon surrounded by sycophants.  <br />If Langley had the courage, she would have pointed out the obvious:  Weill is no David, but indeed the very description of the &quot;rich man&quot; described in Bible:<br />&quot; There was a rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day... The rich man also died and was buried; and in Hell, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom. And he called out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame...  But Abraham said, 'Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. &quot;	2004-07-13

Lucas should have given up his pitiful attempt  at writing, and should've simply copied &quot;Ender's Game&quot; in  entirety - Lucas would have ended up with an immortal masterpiece.  Card is  a rare genius on the level of Charles Dickens, and he created a character  in Ender so complex and vivid, yet so familiar and near to our hearts.   This novel will stand the test of time as one of the very few greatest  sci-fi of all time.	2000-02-17

It's as if Heinlein was able to get away with publishing his first draft.  For a FAR BETTER written novels on the same  topic, read &quot;Forever War&quot;, or even better, &quot;Ender's  Game&quot;.	2000-02-16

Terry Brooks cannot write to save his life, and Stephen Donaldson has a disturbing fixation with women  being abused and raped.  Stephen King and his genius to the rescue.  The  first book was more about the dreamy, eerie atmosphere than about  characters or plots.  The story and characters now beginning to gel in this  sequel.  Roland is now a fully developed character and a sympathetic hero,  and his complex interaction with Eddie is realistically and powerfully  portrayed.  My only complaint is King's extended bit of race baiting in his  portrayal of Odetta/Detta.  However, the ending is vintage King -  suspenseful, powerful, and very satisfying.  Highly recommended.	2000-02-15

I liked the character of the &quot;Evil&quot; enchanter, whom I thought was the most charismatic and enigmatic character  in the novel.  Most of all, I loved the haunting, dreamlike quality of the  novel.  Compare this book to, say, Donaldson's &quot;Mirror of Her  Dreams&quot;, and you'll see how masterful King is in setting up the  characters, context, and the mood with economic precision.  The ending  leaves the reader shaking with anticipation for the sequel.	2000-02-14

I went to business school and work with derivatives, so I read a lot of books on options, but this is by far the best written, lucidly presented books on the topic that I've seen.  It's intended for anyone interested in  options, from absolute novices to options professions.  Highly recommended.	2000-02-02

As an avid fan of the first &quot;Sword of Shannara&quot; series, I returned to the Shannara series after 10 years and was horrified to find that it has mutated into an unreadable mess.  If a high school student  wrote like Brooks on an English essay, he/she would get an F-.  Terry  Brooks, what has happened to you?  Did the promise of big bucks lead you to  sacrifice all of your pride in your literary works and just churn out one  insipid junk after another?  It's truly unfortunate, I won't touch another  of your books again.	2000-02-02

Apparently, a hundred  years later, the interracial romance was still too taboo for Hollywood, so  this theme was white-washed.  The movie also reduced the complex Indian  characters to cardboard cartoons.  Read the original literary masterpiece  when your brain is active, and watch the movie when your brain is  near-dead.	2000-02-01

Donaldson practices what he preaches, so he delivers on fiendishly complex and logical plot.  However, the series did not MOVE me like the Covenant  series did.  Further, the most interesting heroic character was Darsint,  who despite his brief appearance ends up stealing the show.  The same  relevation gets explained time and again by different characters, and after  a while, you WISH for the appearance of some terrifying translated monster,  so that it can SHUT UP the endlessly verbose characters.  The curious  increase of profanities toward the end of book may indicate that Donaldson  himself was anxious to finish the overwrought plot that lacks the chills  and thrills.	2000-01-31

Stephen Donaldson's work is proof definite that fantasy is not just for kids.   Using his awesome command of English language, Donaldson depicts the   psychological warfare of political intrigue so vividly (Edith Wharton and  Henry James will be impressed) that I actually felt sorry for the  &quot;translated monsters&quot; who inadvertently find themselves suddenly  in the middle of the fray. This is not an easy book to read, and Donaldson  challenges the reader to use his/her brain.  If you rise up to challenge,  you'll be well rewarded.	2000-01-28

As a result, his stories still resonates  powerfully after so many years.  On the weak points, Dickens tends to rely  on remarkable coincidences to tie the plots together, and the psychological  studies of his characters are not as sharp and profound as those of  Dostoyevsky or Henry James.  I also found the contrived happy ending very  unsatisfying.	1999-12-27

Its plot is so ingeniously constructed and well-paced that it reads like an epic poem.  However, even  a great soap opera is just that -  a soap opera, and you will find that the  book simply disappears from your mind as soon as you finish it.  This book  will never be a time-worn classic, but you will enjoy its many delicious  and empty calories.	1999-12-27

Like Dorian Gray himself, this book is superficially charming, with its numerous and clever epigrams,  but with some very ugly undercurrents, e.g. virulent anti-semitism,  misogyny, and homosexuality.  We never connect emotionally with Dorian  Gray, who never matures into a complex or interesting character, but  remains as some gay ideal with psychosis.  Read Henry James' &quot;Portrait  of a Lady&quot; or Edith Wharton's &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; for a far  better written, devastating attack on Victorian morals and hypocrisy.	1999-12-02
