The writing is welcoming and the layout does not overwhelm the reader.  The presentation of Spanish grammar is broken down into palatable chunks.  Overall it is a useful grammar book that engages the reader.  It could have used a better editor.  For example, on pages 28 and 29 the text reverses the meaning of \\"ordinal\\" and \\"cardinal\\" numbers, giving false information.  Ordinal numbers are used for ordering things, like first, second, etc, hence ORDINAL for ORDERING, but the book wrongly labels them as cardinal.  On the other hand, cardinal numbers are used for counting, but the book wrongly labels them as ordinal.  A good editor would have caught this reversal.  Despite such little glitches, the book does a good job  of teaching essential Spanish grammer.	2005-08-07

The style is very rambling and much of the book is a tirade against those who don't believe in astrology.  There is not much of substance here for the astrologer.  The book could have used a good editor.  Much is repetitious.  Many \\"facts\\" are inaccurate (such as saying that Morinus was a Catholic Bishop or that with the Sun in Aquarius, the Full Moon will be in Libra).  The book is mildly interesting since Sydney Omarr played a role in popularizing astrology in the last century.  His comments on number symbolism appeared inaccurate and did not describe the people I tried applying them to.  It's light and quick reading.  If you're interested, it's probably best to borrow this from the library.  It's not a book you would ever refer to again.	2004-08-15

In reponse to the need to communicate more effectively at work, I began to learn Spanish.  I took a couple evening classes in conversational Spanish at a local community college.  I also went through several CD progams, including Berlitz, Pimsleur, and a few others.  While I got decent at reading and writing Spanish, listening and speaking always seemed more difficult.  This probably has to do with my not wanting to make a fool of myself in conversation by saying something stupid to one of my clients.  Recently I purchased this set of CDs by Michel Thomas and finally I have found a teacher who knows how to teach conversational Spanish.  His method is excellent and fairly painless.  Although I already knew the vocabulary and grammar on these CDs, they gave me confidence and helped me understand the nitty gritty nuts and bolts of the spoken language in a way that no other teacher or course had done.  I would highly recommended these CDs as a place to start if your goal is to speak and be understood.  The 4 stars reflect the poor packaging.  The individual CDs are wedged into a plastic case and are not in their own sleeves.  My set became dislodged in shipping and I received a set of scratched CDs because they were loose in the box and rubbed against each other in transit.  You might want to buy them at a local store so that you can immediately return them if they are damaged.  Otherwise, you need to ship them back and hope that the new set is not similarly damaged in shipping.	2004-07-11

She set out to avoid the typical &quot;cookbook&quot; approach and instead focuses on how astrologers combine key factors to interpret a chart.  She has succeeded at her task.  Donna gives step by step examples of how she arrives at a delineation so that the reader can follow her example when confronting a new chart.  This text reminds me of a book I once read about how to learn a new language.  It does not teach the language but rather gives helpful advice on how to structure your studies for maximal effect.  My only regret is that Donna did not include more examples so that we could see more of her method in action.  I would highly recommend this book to astrologers at any level of expertise.	2004-07-04

Unlike the majority of astrology books that simply rehash old material, this text is creative and original.  In addition, it is very well written.  The author presents his approach to counseling astrology with plenty of case examples to illustrate his points.  He is clearly conversant with the counseling literature and integrates astrological ideas into sound counseling practices.  His delineations of the psychotherapeutic dimensions of planetary aspects are outstanding.  I learned a lot reading this book the first time, and I'm sure I will read again and again.

She truly understands the signs of the zodiac and the issues they represent in our lives.  Her comments on the natal sun progressing during the life cycle are especially illuminating.  To my mind, this book is one of the classic texts of modern astrology.  I return to it repeatedly for fresh insights about the celesial craft.  It is, hands down, the most influential astrology text I have read in the past decade.  Burt's volume ranks with Bob Hand's &quot;Planets in Transit&quot; as a treasured astrological resource.

The phrases are read in Italian and then English, but sometimes in English and then Italian without warning.  Since I know no Italian, I had a hard time knowing which English word went with which Italian word (and since I was listening in my car, I couldn't check the book while driving to find out).

This work by Eckhart Tolle is an exception.  He seems to have understood the message of the Buddha and has a facility with words that makes his meaning clear in this modern age.  There is much insight and wisdom contained in these pages.  Tolle has experienced the human condition and sees it with a spirtual, mostly Buddhist, perspective.  Since I happen to share much of Tolle's worldview, I really appreciate his ability to convey spiritual ideas in simple English.  This book appears to be the genuine article -- a spiritual treatise by an honest spiritual teacher (though I am put off by how commercial the Tolle enterprise has become with its Tolle 2004 wall calendar and its Tolle deck of spiritual cards, etc.).  Despite the commercialism, Eckhart Tolle has much of value to share.  Highly recommended.	2003-09-15

It is not particularly well written and is often dense and obscure.  Though I'm no expert on Plotinus, I'm not sure that Damiani is accurate in his reading of that ancient philosopher.  For example, let me quote from the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Neo-Platonism: <BR>&quot;Plotinus argued that since the individual soul is one with the All-Soul, it is in essence a co-creator of the Cosmos, and therefore not really subject to the laws governing the Cosmos -- for the soul is the source and agent of those laws! Therefore, a belief in astrology was, for Plotinus, absurd, since if the soul turned to beings dependent upon its own law -- i.e., the stars and planets -- in order to know itself, then it would only end up knowing aspects of its own act, and would never return to itself in full self-consciousness. Furthermore, as we have seen, Plotinian salvation was instantly available to the soul, if only it would turn its mind to &quot;essential being&quot;; because of this, Plotinus saw no reason to bring the stars and planets into the picture.&quot;<BR>It would appear then that Plotinus saw no need for astrology as an essential part of his philosophy, yet Damiani cites Plotinus as the source of his ideas on how to explain astrology in his own philosophy.  It turns out that it was Porphyry who took the ideas of Plotinus and returned to the study of astrology.  Maybe Damiani meant to say he was grounding himself in Porphyry and not in Plotinus?<BR>In any case, I will continue to struggle with this book to see if I can make more sense of it.  Given its obscurity and level of difficulty, I cannot recommend it for the average astrologer.	2003-09-15

He despises Wagner and sets out to discredit the composer whenever possible.  While it is true that Wagner had many despicable traits (antisemitism, mendacity, oportunism, megalomania, womanizing, etc.), Gutman creates a wholly unsympathetic picture of this musical genius.  Gutman sees the influence of Wagner's antisemetism everywhere, similar to the way UFO enthusiasts see the influence of space aliens everywhere in our culture.  As a result this biography is not fair and balanced.  Gutman's goal seems to be to get the reader to despise Wagner as much as he does.  Laon, in his review, gives many detailed examples of Gutman's intellectual slipperiness as a biographer.  Gutman maintains that Parsifal is Wagner's antisemitic magnum opus and the fact that Wagner's text does not support his argument, Gutman regards as proof of how clever Wagner was in hiding his antisemitism in his artistic works.  He hid it so well that only Gutman can see it. Give me a break!  How could the fact that there is no evidence be proof of the agrument he is making?<br /><br />Regarding the \\"ihn\\" versus \\"ihm\\" controversy in Tristan, Laon does a good job in elucidating Gutman's silly inuendoes.  There is another possibility, which is that Wagner was trying to emulate an archaic German, so he may have deliberately chosen the \\"wrong\\" grammar (by modern standards) to make the sentence sound like an older pre-modern Germanic tongue.  Native German speakers sometimes have difficulty understanding Wagner's texts for that reason.  I agree with Laon that Gutman's book is decent on the facts of Wagner's life but is biased and misleading on the interpretation of those facts.  It's too bad that such a knowledgeable writer as Gutman could let his personal biases mar what could have been a balanced and thoughtful biography of this controversial musical genius.  Gutman's logic appears to run as follows:  Wagner was anti-Semitic, Hitler liked Wagner's music and ideas, therefore Wagner was responsible for the Holocaust.<br /><br />I read this book hoping to understand how Wagner, with all his character flaws, could write such beautiful and psychologically insightful musical dramas.  Gutman did not answer my question, except to say that what appear on the surface to be works of genius are really clever attempts by a scoundrel to indoctrinate others into his antisemitism.  How is it then that I come away from listening to Wagner with a loathing of anti-Semitism and a overwhelming experience of comapssion for the human family?was responsible for the Holocaust.

They are a bit rambling and disorganized.  The language reminds me of the Southern California speak of the 60s when everyone was ingesting mind-altering substances.  It was a bit like listening to Austin Powers discourse on Erickson.  Rather than lessons on hypnosis, the content seems to be more like a spiritual exhortation about the wonders of hypnosis in authenticating the self in its relationship with others.  There is talk of chi, life forces, Aikido, channeling, spirits, etc. -- all of which I found a bit too new agey and southern californian for my more traditional east coast taste.  In short, even though the author makes some good points and I have the utmost respect for his writings, I found the tapes disappointing.  The amount of worthwhile content was not worth the high price of the set.  Maybe if I were stoned on some good stuff when I listened, I would have appreciated the message more.	2002-09-07

Erickson, M.D, Vol. 1	Books	5	249	256	N	Y	A classic on the linguistic techniqes of Milton Erickson	This book (Volume I) is worth reading by anyone interested in hypnosis. The authors present the major linguistic techniques that Erickson used to induce and maintain hypnosis, as well as his methods of doing hypnotherapy. They approach Erickson from the discipline of linguistics, so the reading is a bit technical at times, but perfectly understandable if you stick with it. They review the same material many times to make it very clear to the reader. I wish there were an accompanying audiotape of Erickson so that the reader could hear the analogical markings that Erickson uses with his speech to clients. Anyone seriously interested in Erickson's approach to hypnosis should read this book.<br />Volume II is nearly incomprehensive to someone who does not have a Ph.D. in linguistics.  The authors in Volume II appear incapable of expressing their valuable ideas in simple English, which may be a sign that they really don't understand what they are saying well enough to communicate it to others.  Rather than spending your hard-earned money on Volume II, you might read other authors like Steve Gilligan (Therapeutic Trances) who covers the same material in plain English rather than quasi-mathematic formulas and mumbo-jumbo about 4-tuples, etc.	2002-08-24

You need headphones to use these tapes.  They are very relaxing.  Whether they work or not to produce prosperity is another story.  I've had them for a few weeks and will have to see if repeated listening improves my financial situation.  In any case, they are enjoyable to listen to and do induce a refreshing hypnotic trance.  If my income improves substantially over the coming year, I'll write an addendum to this review to give feedback on the outcome.	2002-08-24

All too often modern medicine/psychiatry emphasize the &quot;flight or fight&quot; response while neglecting the freezing response.  In doing so, Levine corrects an important imbalance in our current theories and practices on treating trauma.  I found this book well worth reading, but I wish the author had provided more clinical examples of how he works with clients who have been traumatized.  Had he given more &quot;how-to&quot; clinical information, I would have rated the book 5 stars.	2002-08-12

They are big on hype and low on content.  The author extols the virtues of mind-mapping but gives little practical instruction on how-to-do-it.  I was expecting a more down to earth presentation.  The whole thing is more like an infomercial aimed at promoting the author's consultation practice.  You will find little here of practical use.  After listening to these tapes, I know as little now about mind-mapping as I did before I started.  They were a waste of time and money.	2002-06-13

The author's views are sensible, balanced, and clinically relevant.  He references the clinical and research literature to butress his arguments.  The book is a bit skimpy for the price.  The author refers the reader to his other books, CDs, and tapes for futher information, making this a bit like an infomercial.  In addition, the author sometimes sets up a straw man to make his points.  For example, he writes about therapists who tell their clients to &quot;get their anger out&quot; by pounding a chair with a bat.  This example sounds like a caricature of therapy and I can't believe anyone but the most incompetent novice therapist would take such a stance -- but living on the East Coast, I may be ignorant of how therapy is practiced in California where the author resides.  Nonetheless, the book contains valuable insights for clinicians who treat depression.  It is also one of the few books that deals with the use of hypnosis in depression, which used to be a strict &quot;no-no&quot; according to traditional schools of hypnosis.  In that sense this book is a breath of fresh air in the often dogmatic and opinionated world of hypnosis.	2002-05-12

It presents the &quot;state of the art&quot; of hypnotherapy circa 1964.  Much of what Elman says is still valid, but some of it is antiquated.  For example, he talks about curing the &quot;illness&quot; that is homosexuality.  This concept was dropped from the medical diagnostic categories about a decade after the Elman text was written.  Elman's book is fun reading, especially for those interested in the history of hypnosis in the United States.  He makes some good clinical points and presents several interesting cases along the way.  I wish he had been more specific about the &quot;how-to&quot; of his various techniques.	2002-05-11

It has gone through many editions, this being the most recent and up-to-date.  The information is scholarly, well presented, and clinically very useful.  The authors do seem to have an academic bent and a bit of an anti-American bias.  They question the importance of Milton Erickson's work and poo poo the NLP literature, while at the same time borrowing many clinical techniques from Erickson and NLP without giving due credit.  That minor objection aside, I found this book to be richly clinically relevant and I would recommend it to anyone who uses hypnosis in clincial practice.  It is one of the &quot;Bibles&quot; in the hypnotherapeutic literature.	2002-04-07

The author gives several case examples of people who have been helped by self-hypnosis. It's nice to know that others can use the technique, but I wanted some detailed instructions on how to use it for myself, and that was lacking. In fairness, there is a very brief section on &quot;how to&quot; actually do self-hypnosis, but it is too skimpy.  There are better sources of information out there.  This tape is not worth the money.  I wish I could return it for a refund.	2002-03-16

The exercises are based on the clinical literature and the author's experience as a therapist.  The book is in workbook format with large pages and very long lines of text across the page, which makes reading it difficult for some clients.  In addition, the client has to be fairly well educated to benefit from the text.  It would not be very useful to those who are not very good readers or those who have little formal education (e.g., high school dropouts with little interest in reading).  Nonetheless, the ideas are useful for therapists who can incorporate them into their work without using the text per se.	2002-02-23

I think it was the text for a series of tapes published by Conant.  There is a lot of fluff, and the whole book probably could have been condensed into about 100 pages.  Some of the examples are a bit far fetched.  Why would I want to model myself on someone who spurns human society and lives to be a dog sled racer in Alaska?

I have been studying and using hypnosis with clients for many years, and this book pulls a great deal together in an enjoyable format.

It is short on science and maintains the old idea that animal magnetism is at the basis of hypnosis.  This theory was scienfically discreditated at the time of Anton Mesmer and Ben Franklin.  The practical points are well done, but the theory is consists of New Age claptrap and pseudoscience.  If you want to learn to be a stage hypnotist and don't care about understanding the science behind hypnosis, this is a good book to buy (though it is rather expensive for such a brief volume).  The practical \\"how-to\\" advice is sound.  If you are more skeptical and value the findings of modern science, you will be disappointed since this book promulgates unscientific misinformation and long-discredited theories about hypnotic influence.	2002-02-09

Like all edited works, it suffers from disjunctions in quality and style from chapter to chapter.  I was hoping for a practical manual of how to work with clients.  Instead, I got a book that is solidly researched but that would appeal more to a researcher than a clinician.  I would have preferred a book by a single author who synthesizes the works of leaders in the field.  The content is good but one has to do a lot of work to find the clinically useful material.

The author promises that if you follow his spiritual principles, you will &quot;get everything you want.&quot;  This appeal to human greed and American consumerism runs counter to most spiritual traditions.  In the body of the book he qualifies his title and says you will get what you want only in the way that &quot;God&quot; decides to deliver it.  The book was difficult to read.  Dyer's intense egocentrism permeates the text.  There were also many grammatical and punctuation errors, which prevented the flow from going smoothly.  Dyer also seems out of his element as a spiritual writer.  He does not understand the chakras and falsely attributes sexual reproduction to the base or root chakra, which is actually tied to the function of excretion rather than reproduction.  He also misrepresents Jung's collective unconscious as a kind of repository of human conditioning, which is not at all what Jung had in mind.  Such misinformation makes the rest of his message less credible.	2001-03-11

This kit has a brief booklet describing the planets, yantras, and mantras.  The tapes are excellent and do what they promise.  The booklet is too brief and has misspellings and innacuracies of content.  For example, the author claims that the hour before sunrise is assigned to the planet of the day.  This may be a typo or a misunderstanding since the hour AFTER sunrise is named for the planet of the day, according to the Chaldean sequence of planets.  In fact, this is how the days go their names.<br />The section on the mantras is the barest of outlines.  The printed mantra for the Sun does not match what is said on the tape, which left me wondering which was correct -- the booklet or the tape.  I still have no idea what the proper mantra for the Sun should be.  In addition, there are Sanskrit phrases on the tape for which no text is provided.  Since I don't know Sansrit, I found this to be a significant lack in the kit.  I hope in future editons the publisher will provide a transcript for the Sanskrit words on the tapes to make them easier to follow.<br />Nonetheless, the quality of the tapes is excellent and they are an aid to meditation.  If the written text were better edited to weed out the inaccuracies and describe the tapes, I would have given this 5 stars.	2000-10-04

Unusual vocabulary is listed next to the text in the margin; and the explanatory notes give historical and literary background that bring the text to life.  This is the best place to start for English-speaking students of the Spanish language who are approaching the original Spanish text of Don Quijote for the first time.	1998-06-28

Its vivid natural imagery fosters an intuitive awareness that aids with interpreting the cards.  It is one of my favorite decks and the one I chose to illustrate my book TAROT PLAIN AND SIMPLE (Llewellyn, 1996) -- Anthony Louis.	1998-05-13
