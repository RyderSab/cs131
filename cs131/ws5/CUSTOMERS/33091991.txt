My friends have often suggested marketing as a potential career path because of its combination of creativity and practical analysis, both strengths of mine. I liked this idea and began my search, but found that most of the career books out there were flashy and gimicky, or too specific for what I had in mind. I just wanted somewhere to start that would give me a general picture of what Marketing is all about and what opportunities are to be had in the industry. This WetFeet Insider Guide provided just that--a general view of the different careers in Marketing and a breakdown of the industry itself. The descriptions of different sectors of industry and the profiles of real jobs have given me a lot of ideas as to where I want to go next. And the upbeat writing style got me really charged up.

The 25 firms covered include commercial banks, securities firms, investment banks, credit firms, brokerage firms, and some that encompass all of those services.

This is an excellent easy-to-read manual for anyone interested in the challenge of a non-profit career. The inclusion of government careers and agencies was also really helpful to me in expanding my job search. I was so focused on heart-work in the non-profit sector, that I had never even stopped to consider a career in government. But this guide showed how those career paths can be just as rewarding in terms of making a difference in the world. The lists of organizations saved me a lot of research and provided descriptions and contact information all in one place--a major time saver. Overall, it was as if someone had done all of my research for me in the form of this guide. I feel a step ahead in my career search.	2003-02-19

It really fills a niche and I am yet to find another publication that covers the subject as extensively as this one, if at all. I've been looking into the health care industry for a while now, but can't afford the time and expense of an extensive medical education, but found little information on hands-on medical professions aside from nursing or becoming a doctor. <br />Not only is this guide helpful, but necessary. Many people have been unemployed for so long, they're desperately searching for alternative career paths that they can get into quickly, but that also offer rewarding work. Well, this is it for anyone who has been mildly interested in the health care profession, but hasn't been able to find any really helpful information. The descriptions of individual jobs and workplace conditions was helpful in building a picture of what each career path is actually like. Very helpful overall.	2003-02-19

As a student, I'm still in the exploratory phase of my career development and am looking at a lot of different options. I was a little wary of going for accounting due to all of the recent scandal surrounding the industry. I thought that no firms would even be hiring and that accountants would take on the reputation that lawyers have suffered for decades. But this guide gave me a much better idea of what's really doing on right now in the industry than the media had. The author of the guide seemed to really know what they were talking about. I liked the &quot;On the Job&quot; section the best. It described specific job functions and what they actually do each day. I'm still not sure if I want to ultimately be an accountant, but this guide gave me a much better idea of what an accountant's lifestyle is really like. I feel like whatever my decision is, it will be much better informed.	2003-02-19

This is a great resource for people interested in the large scale real estate industry, especially in commercial and corporate. If working for a large, national, diversified real estate company is what you aim for, this is the guide for you. I have now narrowed down my search to focus on the companies that most appeal to me, and this is based on solid information, not just opinions. The &quot;On The Job&quot; section was also helpful in showing me the differences, pros, and cons, among the various career paths. This is a great guide for those who aspire to have a full-time career in real estate.	2003-02-19

I'm still two years away from graduating, but definitely have a future in consulting in mind. This guide was really helpful in giving me a general overview of the larger firms as well as the industry overall. Along with each firm profile, there is a special section on hiring with information specific to undergrads, which gave me a really good idea of where I stand, and how to prepare to get my foot in the door of the firms I'm most interested in. The Interview Tips were also really helpful.	2003-02-19

This is the best place to start if you're at the beginning of your career exploration, or even if you've been floating for a while. It provides a range of information at your fingertips and saves a lot of time you might spend surfing the net to find out about different industries and careers.

There is no other resource that provides this kind of in-depth information, both the good and the bad, on a single company. Now I have a very clear and detailed picture of the company structure, its business strategy, and the inside culture. I was fully prepared for my interview with intelligent questions. Better yet, if I get the offer (I hope!) I know exactly what I'm stepping into. To anyone interested in working for IBM, I can't recommend this strongly enough.	2003-02-19

So I bought this guide, with a certain amount of skepticism. <br />However, upon opening up to the Industry Overview, I was reassured to find that the guide was actually quite current: &quot;2002 is a different world than 1999, or even 2001. Gone are the days where simply flashing a Computer Science (CS), Electrical Engineering (EE) or MBA degree was enough to start the flow of lucrative job offers.&quot; Yah!, I thought, so what do I do now? This guide went on to answer just that question. Now I have a much better idea of which areas of the industry are the most promising right now, and where I should focus my job search, as well as an overview of the main (and still-existing) companies to look at. <br />The &quot;Getting Hired&quot; section was especially helpful because it broke down information for Undergrads, Advanced Degrees, and Midcareers, rather than just giving general instructions that may or may not apply to you directly. I also found the following Interview Tips helpful for any interview situation.	2003-02-19

I started out at a smaller firm and am ready to move on to a larger one. This provided a great round up of the larger national firms and included information on the company culture of each one. I found that really helpful in deciding which ones I really wanted to focus on. I never knew how important culture was until I actually worked in the legal industry, at a firm where I didn't exactly fit in. I would recommend this guide to anyone beginning their job search right from college or with an already established career.	2003-02-19

After graduation, I was determined to use my advanced degree in geology, but had trouble finding careers paths that weren't necessarily academic. I stumbled across this guide while browsing Amazon's career books section and decided to give it a try. It proved to be worth the cost, as it opened up a whole new path of exploration I had never previously considered. The information is clearly based on solid research--something I can appreciate as a scientist--and presented in a straightforward and entertaining way. Now I'm seriously considering the oil and gas industry as a potential career path, and feel I have everything I need in this guide to get me started on the right foot.
