She works at Country Cousins, an LL Beanesque Catalog Company in Tinker's Cove Maine.  She works 3rd shift, while on break she sticks her head outside to get some air, only something appears wrong.  After she closes the door she can't shake the feeling that she heard something so she opens the door and listens again, this time she hears a car engine, and she goes to investigate, and she finds the owner of Country Cousins in his car wtih a hose running from the exhaust, to the window, an apparent suicide.  This leads Lucy, to the who what where when and why. <br /> <br />This book didn't have a lot of action.  The story and the murderer just happened to fall into Lucy's lap.  She didn't actually do a  lot of investigating.  There wasn't a lot of questions throughout the book.  No red herrings, nothing to really throw you off. <br />It wasn't a shock to see who committed the murders, I was a lot bored while reading this.	2005-05-09

The setting is Easter at Princeton, 1999. Where four roommates are finishing up their senior year, each one having to write their senior thesis. Tom Sullivan the English major who's father became obsessed with the mystery years earlier on the same campus, Charlie, the EMT who was pre-med, Gil the richie rich of the group, and Paul, the boy who sought out Tom because he knew who he was Patrick Sullivan's son, the man who wrote The Belladonna Document, and inspired in him that need to solve the mystery.  Paul's senior thesis is based on the mystery, and the book follows the plight of Paul, Tom, Gil and Charlie as the mystery begins to unravel slowly.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book, it moved faster than The DaVinci Code, and it was easier to understand, and I really enjoy this genre of books, however, I was a bit disappointed at the ending. It just seemed like a major let down. It's still a book well worth reading especially if you enjoy this genre of book. <br /> <br />Heres to hoping we find out more about these 4 men. <br /> <br />	2005-05-06

The characters are the plot, the interactions between the characters are the plot, and the way they are starting to look upon Merry as a leader, not just an object to get beyond their years of celibacy is an important plot point.  Plot doesn't always have to be A + B = C.  If it was we'd be bored, as people and as readers.   <br /> <br />If you don't like racy sex scenes don't read this book.  If you love the way LKH writes characters then read this book.  It is by no means a piece of literary perfection, it is however perfection for those readers who truly enjoy the characters she's created.   <br /> <br />LKH is not a standard author so I think it's important to hold her up to her own standards because she delivered when she wrote this book, the characters are growing, and the relationships are improving, and life at the Sithen is getting more and more interesting.	2005-04-27

This book totally focused on the internal problems of the heroine, while it could have been great, it really wasn't. It was long and drawn out and the plot took a backburner to the relationship which too could have been great, but fell short. <br /> <br />The basis for this story line was such an intense emotional connection between a small child and an ancient carpathian, which did make for a strong bond, however, it wasn't explored to the fullest extent.  The characters never really became real for me, they stayed in 1 dimension instead of becoming 3D. <br /> <br />The plot was exaggerated and boring.  I need less conversation and more action. <br /> <br />I hope Feehan realizes this soon, otherwise her Dark series will stay in the dark for me.	2005-04-10

Alice, who throughout her life has always been the one to be ignored, comes across Joe, her crush from childhood, at a party she catered for someone.  Joe is an up and coming investment banker and he wants a trophy wife to parade around.  So he just knows Alice is the perfect person to mold into what he needs.  So he completely changes her and makes her what he needs.  What Alice should know, but is blind to is that her husband is a major adulterer.  All the signs are glaringly apparent, but she just turns a blind eye.  Joe gets a transfer from London to New York, so they move this story to the USA.   <br /> <br />Alice has always dreamed of living in a little country cottage, and having animals and just getting her hands dirty, so with the transfer Joe receives an enormous housing allowance so one day Alice and Joe go to Conneticut to visit some work colleagues of Joe's and they go looking at property and Alice falls in love with this little cottage that needs a lot of TLC.  This is finally where the story gets interesting, about half way through the book Alice begins to get a personality of her own.  So far we've seen whispers of it, but not enough to care.   <br /> <br />For me I am an extremely character drawn reader, and I didn't particularly like Alice until the book was almost over.  She was rather weak, and blind, and a little bit silly.  I know people like her are real, but I didn't want to see her like that.  The sleeve of the jacket talks about her discovery of herself in this cottage, but it took far too long to even get to the cottage.  I need a little bit more than this book gave me, but it turned it self around in the end.	2005-03-25

In the will Jack Mercy, their father, stated that the only way any of them would get a piece of his pie was if they all lived on the ranch for a year together. They had never met before this day. <br /> <br />This is a story of family, love, trust, and murder. Ms Roberts has a way of wrapping your mind around one idea only to have you so convinced and then bam, the story changes. This story has quickly become one of my favorite Nora Roberts independent romantic suspense novels. She is a favorite in general, but his one had me anticipating what would happen next. <br />	2005-03-07

And it is a wonderfully witty read.  I am not a reviewer who likes to give away major plot points, so hope you don't mind. <br /> <br />Heroine Domini Lancer is a bodyguard, she's a protector.  When her childhood best-friend is receiving threatening letters while on her music tour her management company hires Domini's grandfathers company to set up security and keep an eye on her.  Domini has a gift of being able to see the future, but it doesn't always work to her benefit. <br /> <br />Enter Hero Alexander Reynard, Prime of the Fox Clan, he comes to work for Domini's grandfather because he needs to work.  He's a former Delta Force Op from the Army and he has skills.   <br /> <br />This book was different and similar then other vampire romances that I have read.  Different because it deals with Vampire politics, different class levels of the Vampires etc.  Also, these Vamps aren't \\"out of the closet\\", they are still hidden from the world, but are capable of day walking if they take the right cocktail of medicines, but they aren't ashamed of being Vampires, they are proud, but Alec feels he can do more good as a day walker, instead of a night stalker. <br /> <br />If you enjoy reading Feehan, you will enjoy this new Vamp Romance.	2005-03-04

I couldn't quite give this a higher rating because I knew the plot too early.

Purple rubber dresses?  Feathers?  Leather?   It's a debacle from beginning to end, will Eloise find her dream along the way? <br /> <br />Also, Eloise goes on a journey of self discovery while looking for the father who left her and her brother when she was 5.

It was cute and quirky and made me wonder   what parts of the crazy plot she'd actually truly done.  Although the last 50   pages or so seemed to just zoom in to get the story told quickly, almost like   they felt they took too much time developing the story and decided (...)I   have to wrap this up now.    I will admit this book is not for the feint of heart when it comes to   sensuality/sexuality.  There are some hmmmm \\"group\\" scenes that might turn   peoples heads, so be forewarned before reading.  If it was a movie rating it'd   be R to almost NC 17, as far as certain scenes go, but those are few and far   between, however, this book is fun, quirky, and a little bit slutty, vicarious   thrills are meant to be fun :)  And that is what this is pure fun wrapped in   pink wrapping.

One futuristic enough for those who like to travel forward, but still grounded in the \\"real\\" world.  Roberts is a word painter, her words create a such incredible characters and descriptions that while reading I am I feel like I am standing in New York with airbusses flying overhead. <br /> <br />Each book in this series delves deeper and deeper into the lives of the characters, where when a reader like me picks up a new book, I feel like I am catching up with old friends, not just reading a story.  Their lives and how they love is a beautiful story and I'm sorry for the reviewer who said that Eve was weak, because Eve is one of the strongest characters I've read in a long time, and just because she leans on the man in her life doesn't make her weak, in my opinion that makes her stronger.  Knowing that she can't handle everything on her own.  It takes a stronger person to admit that than it does to try and do it all on your own, and I praise Roberts for enough foresight to know her characters before even beginning writing a book. This will always be a #1 recommendation for me.  I've gotten 3 friends addicted to this series, because as I said at the beginning there will never be another.	2005-01-25

But now that I have met her, I can't believe I waited so long. <br /> <br />She's sassy, and a little vulgar, and she has a problem with saying what she thinks, she's verbally non plussed and just oh so entertaining. <br /> <br />Betsy again gets brought in the fray because some bad guys are killin the vamps.  When the would be assassins encounter Betsy, they don't know what to think because she doesn't bare her fangs, and she doesn't try to kill, she just stands there and verbally assaults them while they shoot at her with bulletts and arrows.   <br /> <br />Davidson, keeps bringing in more quirky secondary characters who I can't wait to see if she keeps bringing them into the Vamps world because they are quirky enough to work. <br /> <br />This is a sassy and slightly romantic, but definately a smile from cover to cover.

Starting with a humorous look at how she'll be on her 3rd husband on page 285 of her autobiography, and having a breakdown about how she's got a butt that's too big and she is average and nothing special and she will be the reason that everyone succeeds, at least I didn't do a Jan Miller.  Jan goes from feeling extremely self confident to feeling like the biggest loser on a daily basis.  I remember those days well. <br /> <br />Jan's meets Josh, who she instantaneously dubs a loser, only later to find out that he's the creme of her crush.  We follow all her mishappenings involving Josh, like eating ice cream with nuts, even though she hates nuts, just because cosmo says that guys like a girl who eats.  Cosmo, Seventeen, YM?  Those are teenagers bibles. And it's great to see them used as a point of humor instead of as the bible, they truly aren't. <br /> <br />Kantor's writing style was easy to slip into, the rhythm worked and put me into Jan's world, while allowing me to remember, how much drama I had when I was Jan. <br /> <br />Kudos to a great teen lit novel full of fun, and clean love.	2005-01-17
US	36630516	R1S6A5UINRVGLY	0743432924	783155306	The Intelligencer	Books	4	1	2	N	N	16th century espionage enticing the 21st century	Leslie Silbert wrote a compelling novel about espionage in the 16th century and the effects it has in the 21st century. <br /> <br />Kate Morgan, a spy, with the Slade Group, an extention of the CIA, has been given an assignment to help decode an old manuscript for one of the Slade Groups valuable clients.  No one knows what is in this manuscript but Kate's passion for Elizabethan espionage has her brain dancing.   <br /> <br />Silbert weaves the story from 2 different time periods, showing how the actions of Christopher \\"Kit\\" Marlowe, playwright and spy, have shaped the reactions of the villians in the 21st century.  The chapters switch between Marlowes world and Kate's world, and you are never truly sure who the bad guy is until the end.   <br /> <br />What kept this from being a 5* book is that one story line seemed to just fall short.  Hopefully that particular storyline will continue in her next Kate Morgan story.	2005-01-16
US	36630516	R1EXC3UK65N6V0	0380813068	388133853	Perfect Match	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Perfectly Delightful	Granted this book isn't a work of literary perfection, but it did provide for me what I was looking for.  A little fun, a little romance, and 2 characters I adored from the start.   <br /> <br />Alistair and Lauren just had this innocent chemistry that went way beyond innocence.  There was plenty of sexual tension, and yes Lauren might have been a little flighty, I didn't consider her to be immature.  Innocent is the word I chose to describe her, and a free spirit.  A girl who is naive, but isn't afraid to speak whatever her pops into her mind. <br /> <br />The other 2 characters in this four-some Oliver and Barbara were the boring pair, and maybe that is why she left them underdeveloped, I just didn't feel the same connection to them as I felt to Alistair and Lauren.  If the author was going for genuine romance between 4 people she fell seriously short, but if the focus was to be Alistair and Lauren, then the book was spot on.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book immensely and the rating of 3 is because of the underdeveloped characters.  Not based on the story.	2005-01-10

US	36630516	RWN0IBENPYKLQ	0553382357	926828249	Dear Prince Charming	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Kauffman has made me a fan	With each book I read of this authors I grow to adore her writing more and more.  The first book I ever read by her was The Cinderella Rules, I am a big contemporary fairy tale fan, and I just thought it was great.  Then I come across another Glass Slipper, Inc adventure and it was in my pile of have to reads.   <br /> <br />Valerie has been obsessed with fashion since she was 9 years old, and has held every job under the sun when it comes to the world of fashion. So she lands herself a job as PR for a new fashion mag, and she scores the coup of the century only to have it it unravel at the seams a couple of days before the magazine launch. <br /> <br />This story follows her mishaps and misunderstandings as she learns that Prince Charming isn't always Princely and isn't always Charming. <br /> <br />Highly recommended chic lit fun. <br /> <br />	2005-01-06

What I found was anticipation always lets you down. <br /> <br />In another review I read that the world just has to evolve, and that is part of what is missing, I missed being able to make the Hollows my own, using my own mind to create the world in which Rachel lived.   <br /> <br />Too much time was spent making sure the reader had a lot of information about everything, and the plot wasn't allowed to expand beyond the words on a page. <br /> <br />I will however read the next installment because one of my favorite series I didn't fall in love with until the fourth book.  So I haven't lost hope, and am still looking forward to greatness because I believe Kim Harrison can be great.	2005-01-03

But as with many series, I will continue to read them, because authors tend to grow and that is when the excitement happens. <br />	2005-01-03
US	36630516	R1JJESIEKLC2MU	0060584009	77217173	Metro Girl (Alex Barnaby Series #1)	Books	3	1	4	N	N	Not Quite Plumalicious but Almost	Evanovich's last 2 Plum books have in my opinion been lacking the usual Evanovich luster.  Getting into Metro Girl, I have had my faith restored.   <br /> <br />Metro girl is smart and sassy and reminicent of the early Plums.  Nothing could compare to Grandma and the gun, I found the humor back, and a new muse for Janet in her daughter.  Barney is her Janet's daughter physically and I wouldn't be surprised if she was similar to Alex's personality. <br /> <br />NASCAR guy, I thought he was funny, referring to himself as NASCAR guy wasn't to toot his own horn as much as to get under Barney's skin.  Granted he's no Ranger, but I didn't start truly drooling over him until the stories developed a little more.  Hopefully being able to change her muses will give Janet more material and more new things for her characters to do. <br /> <br />I think people should look at this Series as a new series and not expect it to be Plum, because if it was Plum all the way through, you wouldn't have liked that either. <br /> <br />Let the Series mature more before making a final decision. <br /> <br />I felt this was fun, frosty and made me long for another installment.	2005-01-03
US	36630516	RN8EW26SZSEAZ	0425198243	55431338	Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake Vampire Hunter)	Books	5	16	41	N	N	Hot, New, And Interesting	Was I as an Anita fan satisfied?  Yes!!!!!!!!!!  Do all questions have to be answered in the next book?  No!  Did more questions get raised?  Yes!  Will I keep reading?  YES!  Why?  Because this book was excellent.   <br /> <br />I get offended reading negative reviews stating that LKH is living out her fantasies while writing and that this is just Porn.  If you've bothered to get to know the author you are reading.  LKH states that she pushes the envelope in her writing because of the censorship that has been placed on women authors. <br />I won't deny that this book was sexy, or erotic because it was both, but this is a series 12 books in length, the plot is the interaction between the characters.  Not just the crime that brings them together.  After 12 books if the characters did not become a priority I would have been bored stiff.  I enjoy each journey LKH takes me when she writes, and I praise her for having the guts to push the envelope.  She is a mainstream author who doesn't have to hide her talent for writing both the serious and the sensual in an e-book.   <br /> <br />If there is too much sex in the series now, don't read it!   <br /> <br />The book was engaging and sensual and funny.  Yes there was some editing errors, but the plots were well thought out and written wonderfully.  It was a book I had to force myself to put down because I just didn't want it to end.  For me this is my new favorite because the characters are more alive.  I don't read for the plot I read for the characters and they just keep getting better and better.  So take a chance and look at the characters, don't count the errors or the sex scenes you might be suprised that Anita is no longer a frigid woman.  She has compassion, and sensuality that goes far beyond sex.	2004-12-10
US	36630516	R1NM00VN7FMMHS	0758205686	411061939	Ghosts Of Boyfriends Past	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Smart and Sassy and Fun	Madison's tale into reliving her boyfriend mistakes is a light hearted and enjoyable read.  The book spans the 10 years of Madison's life since she graduated college.  And her 2 major relationships, 2 major job changes, and the 3rd chapter in her life, her 3rd job and trying to find the one.   <br /> <br />Being a woman, I could relate to her relationship mishaps and desire to find the one.  We all hope that we have him, and her imagination just goes to extremes with the men.  It's funny to look at a character and see a little piece of myself in her. <br /> <br />This book had a quirky cast of characters, but some of the minor ones were under developed.  But I enjoyed every moment Madison spent being consoled by her friends and consoling in return. <br /> <br />Don't we all have moments of when our past relationships come back to haunt us at the most horrible times?	2004-12-10
