Shakespeare--undiluted--for everybody, either kids or adults!  The layout of this book couldn't be more helpful.  After a brief introduction, the compiler gets down to business.  Each speech or poem is preceeded by a brief explaination, and after the selection, a small word-list to aid understanding.  All are swathed in beautiful, dramatic paintings that are truly helpful for comprehension.  All the famous lines are here, from Henry V's Agincourt \\"St. Crispin\\" speech, his inly-ruminating soliloquey about the nature of power, scenes from Macbeth, Midsummer Night's Dream, Hamlet, and a couple of sonnets, and much more.<br />There are two things that are very impressive about this book.  First, the compiler manages to introduce very adult themes about power,loyalty, etc., as well as the vocabulary of 400 years ago,even a brief explaination of iambic pentameter in a tone so chatty that you hardly realize you are learning.  Second, the rich pictures impart a thirst for MORE Shakespeare.  You'll hear, \\"Can we hear more?  What's the rest of this story?\\" often!<br />Any publication that presents the Bard as accessable and enjoyable deserves a place in every school or public library, and certainly every home.  Add this to Charles and Mary Lamb's \\"Tales of Shakespeare\\" as a new classic.	2002-02-21

Don't answer lightly: pray for those who did	The basics of this classic human story of survival used to be common knowledge to every Western schoolchild.  Perhaps political correctness has taken the sting out of it by avoiding the difficult details, labeling them as being unsuitable for children.  But in doing so, Westerners have reduced the Donner Party story to a spurious stain on American character--a ghastly blot to be rubbed out and forgotten, when it is in fact a triumphant lesson, an epic of Shakespearian porportions.  And the man who best told the story of these 80-odd Americans, wrenching it away from the penny-dreadful press of the 19th Century, slicing away the innuendo and whispers, giving it poignancy and humanity, was George Rippey Stewart and his book, &quot;Ordeal By Hunger&quot;.  Seventy years later, it still triumphs as a classic of its kind.<br />Stewart's style, which is searching and quiet, epitomizes the newspaperman's emphasis on fact.  Yet there are passages in &quot;Ordeal&quot; that are so delicately humane, so generous and compassionate, that you will wish Mr. Stewart was still alive, so that you may thank him.  Again and again, he emphasizes what should be obvious--that cannibalism was only a  part of the ordeal, a symptom of that place in human experience where only Will stands between life and oblivion.  That is a dark country, indeed--darker, even, than cannibalism.<br />There have been a dozen or more major books on the Donner Party catastrophe since the mid-1800's.  The first were obsessed with shocking detal.  The more recent books have left a strange impression of sanitized, reductionalist &quot;cheerfulness&quot;--a sign, I fear, of our own time's obsession with relativist pragmatism.  The man who saw the Party's members for what they were--a slice of the humanity of us all, acting out a Morality Play that is timeless--was George Stewart. &quot;Ordeal By Hunger&quot; should stand with the very best works of American letters.	2002-01-06

You have to experience Joyce's illustrations to appreciate their lush intricacy, but even they aren't as good as this book's warm story, the tone of which perfectly captures the &quot;Boy's Life&quot; fiction of the American West, circa 1908.  <br />Spunky Art Atchison, along with Spaulding his pal and Esther his little sister have a thrilling adventure after Santa calls them all North.  They battle dark elves and evil queens with gee-whiz pluck (and a candy-bomb of Art's own design).  But even THAT isn't the big hug in the book---it's the very end that makes this gem a keeper.  Few read those two letters and go away untouched.   <br />Every year several gooey Christmas books come out, both religious and secular, and very few are worth much.  But years after purchasing this one, we still pull it out and comb the rich pictures for new details.  Forget the &quot;Ages 5-9&quot; recommendation for this: &quot;Santa Calls&quot; is for everybody!	2001-12-07

More than Scotland, perhaps even more than Ireland, Wales evokes the bittersweet longing for a mythic past, with its warriors, language, courage and sovereignity.  For people seduced by the pathos of the underdog, Cymru signifies the biggest fish of all, and it is no wonder that even Shakespeare, bigot though he could be, had his Henry V declare a willingness to wear the leek on St. David's Day, &quot;For I am Welsh, you know, good my countryman!&quot; <br />The delightful Jan Morris (&quot;Oxford&quot;, &quot;The Oxford Book of Oxford&quot;)seems to float over the twilit southern valleys and stern northern crags in this very enjoyable book. All the names, events, and movements are here, richly retold: Owen Glyndower, the Chartists, Methodism.  And although the book is 15 years old, Morris managed to catch the beginnings of the great Welsh revival of the last ten years or so...the groundswell of a new acceptance of Welsh culture (culminating today in today's Britpop bands, literature, etc.) and the avid interest youth are now showing in the revival of the Welsh language.  A very good overview of one of the most romantic, mythic--and tragic--places on earth.	2001-07-12

This book is the collected speaches from that October night. <br />From the distance of ten years, the maverick nature of this event is fading somewhat.  Any alternative--or at least the distrust of public schools--is now part of mainstream debate in America.  &quot;The Exhausted School&quot; is worth reading nonetheless for the fire in the belly passion these men and women felt in offering a better way.  And it's important to remember that Gatto--with his &quot;Teacher of the Year&quot; credibility---is the guy who got the dialogue started. Even the idea of renting such a venerable performance space for the event defies elitist decorum. The fact that certain teachers' unions and teachers' colleges tried to diss the &quot;speakout&quot; adds additional outlaw cachet. <br />Old homeschooling and unschooling hands won't find anything particularly new here--Gatto's speaches are reprinted elsewhere. But the various Sudbury-style and community grassroots school reps' presentations --as well as the pleas of Gatto's young students--are wonderful.  If you're feeling draggy in your commitment to a Better Way than the American Public Education Behemoth, this book is like a good hug.	2001-06-08

He doesn't harp on any one group's preeminance but instead shows us the region's social, political and economic fortunes from European discovery to the present, through graphs, photographs, political cartoons.  Missing is only a much-needed chapter on pre-historic Native American habitation, but given his even-handed handling of the issue throughout the rest of the book, this is a quibble easily corrected in future editions.<br />&quot;The Pacific Northwest&quot; would be a valuable text in a high school or college setting, as well as for the general public.	2001-05-24

Floor-plans, innumerable photographs and drawings (many of homes now destroyed), and portraits pepper the text, which is readability itself.  <br />The book follows a chronological path from the Mediaval Household to the present day.  The text isn't dry at all.  Delicious details abound: Bess of Hardwick pacing her Great Chamber of Hardwick Hall, waiting for the royal visit that never came in the instantly-dated house she'd built for this very purpose, ...  The origin of the phrase &quot;backstairs intrigues&quot; (both political and sexual).... the slow but persistant birth of the aristocratic ideal of &quot;privacy&quot;--and how it affected dining halls....the rise of the great dilettante libraries (and the rooms to house them).....and the advent of the freakish innovation of indoor plumbing (and a picture of the Duke of Wellington's elaborate WC) are just a few tidbits.<br />Mr. Girouard doesn't neglect the &quot;downstairs&quot; portion of a Great House, because he's interested in the whole institution  as a functioning unit.  Some of the most intriguing photos are of beloved servants' portraits, and the almost Shaker-like beauty of a working kitchen or laundry.  Included, also, is a printed &quot;Summary of Livery Men's Duties, Etc., Etc.&quot;, of Hatfield House, and darned if it doesn't sound like instructions for empoyees at an indifferent New York hotel!<br />This book is a delicious retrospective, and will make any red-blooded Anglophile who longs for one of these faded leviathans very happy indeed.  Now, if you need me further, I will be in the Orangery.	2001-05-13

The many essays detail out the rise of Islam and its accompanying culture, and it's the first general survey I've seen to cover sub-Saharan Africa as well as Eurasia, the Far East, and the Indian sub-continent. As good as the text is, though--and as fun---it's those pictures that make this book superb.  From lone minnerets on the Xinjiang plains to the gorgeous mud-brick mosques of Djenné, the architectural dictates of Islam have produced some of the most striking and functional buildings our species has ever come up with.  It gives me a great sense of communion with the Moslem world, whatever our ideological differences.  The pictures in this Oxford History are sensitive and at times poignant...a close-up of a gorgeous tiled pillar, with the tile flaking off with age, revealing superb brickwork underneath comes to mind.<br />Those who like me know little of the Moslem world will appreciate the very readable text, with its slightly shaming details (the Moslems came up with the idea of a Hospital/dispensary as an adjunct to the mosque.....and their brilliant textiles were carried off by returning crusaders who had little appreciation for how difficult they were to make!)<br />As a scholarly text, &quot;The Oxford History of Islam&quot; may indeed have some holes---I wouldn't know.  But as an introduction to the addictive beauties of Islamic art, and as an overview of the Moslem explosion throughout the world (including some Eurasian places you've never heard of!) I can't think of a better selection than this.  You'll never want to part with it.	2001-05-08

Credibility notwithstanding, the results are mixed, and frankly, if an artist is just going to kvetch, I'd rather read Japanimé.  But Chris Ware has something to say, and he says it: cleanly, viciously, in breathtaking and seemingly facile images.<br />I don't think it's stretching things to say that this book's scope is on the level of Chopin; they both have the same miniaturist claustrophobia yet wide-open feel.  Jimmy Corrigan is the sum of his forefather's failings.  His inner world offers no relief--it's populated with giant fathers, Kafkaesque in their brutality--and with faceless women who seem tantalizingly out of reach from the depth of his knowledge. He moves through a series of emotional cataclysms remeniscent of Kasinski's &quot;Painted Bird&quot;, and yet they're miniaturist in nature, a sort of everyday heartbreak.  They've reduced him to a little nubbin of a man, unable to fend off any sorrow.  Connection--with anyone, anything--seems a dream, and yet his valiant little heart keeps hoping.  <br />What Ware is saying about the anihilation of men is so true, I felt I was being given a blueprint of men's souls.  A useful, if odd, thing to bring away from reading a comic.  But truth comes in many forms.  This is a keeper.	2001-04-23

It's the crowning irony of her career that when an author writes a book this good, she will inevitably not please everyone. Fans of the Holmes-Russell detecting duo will cry foul over this mystery's lukewarm punch.  Fans of the emotionally satisfying Holmes-Russell courtship and marriage will sift &quot;The Moor&quot; for bodice-ripping scenes--in vain.  And fans of the Sherlock Holmes Canon will yell automatically, but we who love her books them anyway.<br />Still, it's one of her best, and for the same reasons all her Mary Russell books--even the weak ones--are good.  Dartmoor unfolds before us as a kind of moral proving ground, a Presence.  We are introduced to Sabine Baring-Gould in the winter of his prolific life, and to his house, which is another Presence--ramshackle, book-lined, with the smell of dinner wafting through to the dusty library.  Ms. King knows what she likes, and delivers: innumerable fires in the grate, banked up against the storm outside, and chairs drawn up to the fire-irons, and the tea-things close to hand.  She knows Holmes looks must fetching slumped in a fireside chair at 2 a.m., his fingers steepled as he ruminates a difficult case with Mary.<br />And she knows that what her fans really want is not merely a cold-blooded mystery nor an incongruous bodice-ripper, but for her characters to be true to the real adult people they so obviously are, and to love each other.  Which they do, in spades.  Holmes' unspoken devotion to Baring-Gould was nicely understated.  And King's most romantic scene in the Beekeeper books occurs as Mary, in slightly over her head while sleuthing, paces the floor for Holmes' return.  A deftly written moment, and one that makes me wonder how some readers could have so completely misunderstood what Laurie King was trying to say about the integrity of erotic love and emotional bonds.<br />Alas, &quot;The Moor&quot; was over too soon, and I was left immersed in an atmosphere of old books, old hymns, the power of the moor, and the passing of something grand and beautiful.  Not bad, for a historical mystery.	2001-04-20

But boy, does she succeed.  Mary Russell is every bit as Holmsian as Holmes, and she will not be gainsaid.  Nor will she be bullied, patronized, or pawned off to the research end of their growing partnership.  Holmes believes in her, and so does Laurie King, and this is where &quot;The Beekeeper's Apprentice&quot; goes from good to great.  There's no silly tossing of heads or insults (well, not many), and although Holmes does go haring off into the undergrowth occasionally, there's always a logical reason for it.     <br />Smart, beautifully written,lush with detail, and absolutely believable, &quot;Beekeeper's Apprentice&quot; is one of the best reads around.	2001-04-14

Ms. King knows exactly what words to put in her characters' mouthes because she believes in them, and so do we, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle notwithstanding.  The mystery in itself is frankly boring, but, maybe more to the point,it intrigues Russell, and as she says, &quot;If detecting is what I do, than theology is what I am.&quot;  A nice touch.<br />It's the vague yet almost palable ache between these two delightful misfits that impresses me most in King's second in the series, as well as her encyclopediac knowledge of London and environs, and her top-drawer characterizations, especially of the redoubtable Mycroft and Watson.  But if it's strictly mystery you're after, you may be disappointed.	2001-04-14

I can't rave about this little book enough.  I'm reading it to my two 5th graders, my 4th grader, and my first grader as an adjunct to our classical homeschooling history.  It is so compact and yet so thorough.  The pictures are lots of fun...little old line drawings and woodcuts.  There are at least two per chapter and they ADD rather than distract.  Each chapter is about a famous figure in American History.  Eggleston's style is amazing--literate, and yet straightforward.  The questions after each 3-4 page chapter are direct and helpful...no twaddle.  The vocabulary words are a big bonus.  <br />I want to be clear: Eggleston's little miracle book isn't just an antique curiosity , filled with embarassing 1920's racial slurs or hero-worship.  It's an honest, time-tested, balanced book...the opening chapters on Columbus alone prove this.  And it's very versitile.  I can see this being a story or textbook, with either the questions and vocab included in as a unit, or ignored completely.  This is how we use it: I read to the kids, and they summarize each chapter on paper.  Then I ask the included questions, and we discuss. <br />Another note: please, please don't be put off by the odd cover of this little gem!  The binding is made to last.  It would be a great gift to any child.	2000-10-16

It's wonderful, I can't rave about it enough.  It is a good introduction to roots in our language, and it's amusing, also, a fact that has kept our kids hooked for about a year.  <br />Each root (mal, mano, gen, etc) has about 5 pages of activities to help seal both the root and its English derivatives into a kid's head.  These are often VERY funny.  They're short...each page is covered easily in about 1/2 hour.  They're reproducable. The skill-level is variable.  The humor makes it suitable for a wide range of kids...4th-5th grade through High School.  I know that sounds ambitious, but it's really true! Each page has the root and its origin printed at the top.  By the end of the book, a kid should know 35 roots and hundreds of new English vocabulary words.

She had friends, some mentioned in her diary.  One of these was Hannah Gosler, &quot;Lies&quot; in Anne's  writings.  Now Hannah Gosler has set down her childhood memories of both  Anne and her own terrifying experiences during the Nazi occupation of  Holland. Mrs. Pick-Gosler's odyssey is every bit as astonishing as Anne's.   <br />The book begins with the Franks' disappearance and careens headlong into  the Goslers' own nightmare. Somehow, Hannah manages to keep hold of her  toddler sister Gabi even as the rest of her family dies--in pieces, member  by member.  There is the heartrending chance reunion with Anne through an  Auschwitz fence mentioned in the Afterward of Anne's diary.  And finally  the end of the war and surreal &quot;liberation&quot;...from a Nazi cattle  car, with Auschwitz survivors staggering out into a deserted snowy field,  almost senseless with illness and starvation, their guards having fled.   <br />Parents should be both warned and assured: this beautiful book doesn't  flinch from brutal fact, but in Ms. Gold's deft hand the language manages  to convey information without any morbidity.  And the haunting photographs  are a precious inclusion.  We see little Anne, dark eyes laughing, against  the backdrop of her Amsterdam appartment building. Hannah grows up before  our eyes in a series of photos taken against this same wall.  There is one  photo of Hannah holding little Gabi, and it's shocking to know this is the  same child she managed to keep alive through the Nazi concentration camps.   <br />But the most heartbreaking photo is on the back of the book.  Nine  beautiful little girls line up, arms around shoulders, smiling in pretty  party dresses.  It's Anne's birthday.  Looking at all those nobby knees and  sweet faces will take your breath away.  Many of the girls didn't survive  the war.  And yet in a few short years Hannah would save a life, and Anne  (whom Hannah called the Pole Star) would writeone of the most important  documents of the the 20th Century.	2000-09-08

Stuff like this sits on my nightstand for delicious  evening perusal.  But this collection of poems, maxims, and the odd sermon  excerpt was disappointing.  It's long on Rossetti and short on meaty  passages of any sort.  <br />The book is roughly set up along the  organizational lines of the Book of Common Prayer (a smallish liturgical  year reading selection) and the Anglican Hymnal (The Christian Life)and  their are many gems here, including a collect by Jonathan Swift that is  beautiful.  But my irritation rose when I found that the compiler, Robert  Backhouse, had sliced the most muscular verse out of Emily Brontë's most  famous poem, &quot;No Coward Soul is Mine&quot;.  You know, the verse that  starts, &quot;Vain are the thousand other creeds of men, unutterably  vain...&quot;  Given that this is an Anglican anthology, perhaps I  shouldn't be surprised.  <br />I'd love to own an intensive Anglican reader,  filled with passionate entries of the sort that make me proud to be an  Anglican.  Someday I may.  This one, although sweet, is a bit too fluffy  and twee for me.	2000-08-18

This is the first one I've read with real meat on its  bones.  Goldberg addresses the common insecurities writers face with  compassion and a wonderful matter-of-factness I found really refreshing and  helpful.  Not all of us are named &quot;Annie&quot; and have our own  private island on which to write!  Natalie Goldberg knows this, and she  knows a lot of us struggle with an Inner Editor, the constant critic who  sneers, &quot;This sucks!  Just pack it in.&quot;  She suggests real  techniques to overcome insecurities and blocks, but more importantly, she  gives the reader permission to write the way he already writes, without a  backward glance at the way he &quot;ought&quot; to do it.  Very highly  recommended!	2000-08-17

It has inspired generations of enthusiasts, myself included.  My favorite feature remains  the clear illustrations, including cross-sections of his favorite vug  pockets, proper placement of gads, prospecting with ultraviolet light, and  the copious photographs of geomorphological indicators.  For the absolute  beginner and experienced hand alike, this is heady stuff.  It's practically  a mini-geology course in a book.  Mr. Sinkankas' style couldn't be easier  to read.  If you ever run across his classic Mineralogy, snag it.  It'll  have you hooked for life.	2000-04-26

Written in a razor-sharp style, The Barbary Pirates recreates America's first formal naval engagement since the Revolutionary War.  Stephen Decatur and the core  of young naval officers at the heart of this remarkable story are more than  American heroes, they are icons of dash and bravery, and intelligence. This  book is an excellent introduction to one of the least-known periods of  American history, a time when her Navy was young and the Barbary  States---Morocco, Tunis, Tripoli and Algiers---terrorized the Mediterranean  and Europe.	2000-04-10

Well, I don't actually know him, but I know a friend who...okay, I don't actually know anyone who knows him, but he signed my presentation copy of High Fidelity. So, okay, it's actually the library's copy, but he's definitely on my  top-ten, all-time best writers list of the nineties...     Nick Hornby writes  romances.  Sure, they're guy romances, which means there's a lot of duck  and cover, much waffling, and many reorganizations of CD collections.  But  the bed-swapping is desultry and the typical masculine evasions are  half-hearted, because Hornby's men are all in their mid-thirties and are  beginning to experience the nagging heebie-jeebies, a sort of group angst.   What if, they think, to paraphrase Gregory Corso, what if I'm sixty years  old and all alone, with pee-stains on my underwear?  What if I'm merely  ordinary?  What if I'm not...special?  What if I'm going to die?     Nick  Hornby's men have virtually no moorings.  They simply await the opinion of others.  They're like helium balloons,  their strings digging annoyingly into the palms of the women and children  who stubbornly hold onto them.  Inevitably, these people want to let them  go.  And when they do, Hornby's antiheroes are terrified--of dissipation,  of annihilation, of being alone.  Without the defining weight of family,  these men suspect they'd be merely ciphers.  They'd be right, but they'd  also be wrong, and this is what makes Hornby's books so quietly beautiful.      Rob Flemming doesn't have a life, he has a list.  He's the spectator on the  sidelines, keeping his options open, scorecard in hand, calculating up  averages.  The results are mixed:  he can quote you the entire Stax  catalogue, but he can't really tell you why Laura, his lover, is moving  out.  True, yes, there was that affair and a baby and an abortion,  but...but....      Well, Rob suspects he's really a nasty wretch of a  slimeball, and to prove it to himself, he begins revisiting all the  disasterous lost-loves of his Pre-Laura days (in chronological order, of  course).  He has a half-hearted affair with a real recording artist, and   suitably thrilled to discover HER ex is a well-known American musician  (\\"Steve\\";, but he's not going to name-drop).     Not a lot happens in  a Hornby book, but the flow is so effortless, so peppered with trenchant  growthfulness, so well written and sardonic, and so damn funny, that you  don't much care.  This is partly due to Nick Hornby's talent for dialogue,  which he writes with the same flawless ear as fellow Britons Nina Bowden  and Barbara Pym.  At one point in the book, when Laura is haranguing Rob on  his failings, she says, \\"You just...you just don't do  anything.  You get lost in your head, and you sit around thinking instead  of just getting on with something, and most of the time you think rubbish.   You always seem to miss what's really happening.\\" To which he replies,  \\"This is the second Simply Red song on this tape.  One's unforgivable.   Two's a war crime.  Can I fast-forward?\\"     Buy this book, read it the  first time for the humor, which will have you on the floor.  Read it again,  for it's poignancy.  And if you see Rob, give him a hug for me.  He's not  such a bad lot after all.	2000-04-02
US	52801789	RX5XP87CQBNJ7	0679405798	365726027	Great Expectations (Everyman's Library)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Grow Old First...Then Try It Again	I, too, languished through this in High School.  I, too, vowed never to pick up Dickens again.  Then something happened.  This is not bragging: it just happened. I grew up.   Any intelligence I had mellowed into  understanding, a very different faculty.  Saddened, changed, I picked up  Dickens again.  And at last, I understood.   Great Expectations isn't a  classic for its language, plotting, style or wit. Like all Dickens' work,  it is faulted in these areas.   It's a classic because of Dicken's passion,  which along with Bleak House pours onto the page and if you are at the  right time of life, into your heart.   So to all the reviewers here who  find him problematic, wait a bit.  Read a little about the nightmare world  he lived in, the choked waterways slimey and poisonous with oil, feces and  dye...the dangerous, airless shacks stacked up on each other, the rotten  food...when it could be had at all.  If you can, too, research a little  into the social mores of the day, because what Dickens says about Victorian  manners is quite true: virtue was often toggled to wealth in an absurd  attempt to justify those unworthies clawing their way to the top of the  &quot;Beehive&quot;.   Try Dickens again later, when you have grown old.   He's a ripping good yarn, but you must forgive him...he sees people as tiny  valiant miracles amidst a roiling world of injustice, farcical posturing,  physical danger, ignorance and want, and he needs to tell you about it.    He often jokes about it, because the society he was writing for was very  touchy and required its medicine to be sugar coated.  It is only after  you've put a Dickens book down that the images--minus the wit--pour over  you and like the smoke curling through a Dickens novel  it occurs to you  you cannot breathe...	1998-12-29

US	52801789	R2WL4R55WWMXVC	0486236420	16530017	Ralph the Heir	Books	5	49	51	N	N	Trollope shines as portraitist, moralist, amiable cynic	Ralph The Heir, written late in Antony Trollope's life, is not as well  known as his Palliser or Barchester novels, and this is a great shame.  To  my mind his talents are on display here in all their mature glory; his  penetrating observation of human motive and weakness, combined with a  raucous, convaluted storyline and a wicked sense of humor.  Trollope knows  people through and through, and it is no small thing that he refuses here  to make even his villain a monster.      In true Trollope form, Ralph who  is the heir (there are two Ralphs and two heirs) is in embarrased  circumstances.  Having spent a rather idle life waiting for his uncle to  die so that he might inherit (and with the old squire hale at sixty, this  will not likely happen soon), Ralph finds himself in debt up to his  eyeballs...or perhaps his hand-tooled hunting boots.  With a stable of  hunters and a fierce riding breeches habit, Ralph must do something, but  what?        Just what Ralph does, and how it touches the whole pantheon  within his circle (and a few decidedly outside it!) gently underlines  Trollope's deep concerns for his time: just what is a gentleman?   What,  indeed, is nobility in man and woman?  And how are we so often willfully  blinkered by love, loyalty, ambition, and hate?          There are several  storylines in Ralph The Heir, and the author does not disappoint those who  delight in watching him tie all these delicious tales together in almost  Seinfeldian fashion.  Parliament figures prominently and the election (or  rather the attempt at an election) of a principal character is so  marvelously portrayed, so wicked, it alone is worth the price of the book.       Trollope is a gem.  Gentle, kindly in his characters, he truly loves  people and when he laughs at them, I rather think he is laughing also at  himself.  Enjoy this; it's one of Trollope's best.	1998-09-02

If you require beach or poolside reading matter, snap this up.  Well researched and written in a quiet, unexploitive style, Jerry Oppenheimer's Just Desserts is just the cure for all of us women who have picked up a Stewart book and noted that the embarrassing state of our cupboards and couches just don't measure up to the seemingly effortless beauty Martha espouses.  It seems that all that beauty takes money and muscle; according to Oppenheimer, not a lot of it is Martha's.  The book weaves through the swathe of lives Martha has cut her way through, never discounting her acheivements.  It's just the right touch.  But man, oh, man...if one-tenth of it is true, Andy and Lexi Stewart have had a rough ride indeed!	1998-05-26
