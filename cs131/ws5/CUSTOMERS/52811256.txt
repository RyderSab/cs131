It has excellent character development.  In particular, the main characters Inspector Banks and Annie Cabbot are well developed.  Banks' suffering and loneliness is brought out very well.  The book makes the point that you never can know what life will bring and that all surprises are not good ones.  The ending is a surprise, but it is logical and skillfully developed.<br /><br />You really can't beat Peter Robinson for the modern police novel.	2005-07-01

The victims are well-developed before they are killed and, as always, Diamond is plenty of fun.  The author also draws interesting portraits of the other detectives, Jimmy Barneston and Hen.  The ending is impossible to guess and is almost certain to surprise the reader.  You really can't beat this mystery for writing quality, plotting, character development and humor.	2005-06-12

This book is entertaining, puzzling and intriguing.	2004-12-22

The book has two successful love stores (Reginald/Mary and Rufford/Penge) and three failed love stories (Twentyman/Masters; Trefoil/Rufford and Trefoil/Morton).  It deals honestly with the emotions of all concerned.  Every scene is put together with the thoughtful approach of Trollope, who never lets any strand of the plot dangle. <br /> <br />What makes this book unusual is Senator Gotobed, who is on a visit from America.  The Senator speaks frankly about everything and often offends his English hosts.  His comments bring buried tensions to the surface.  I ended up admiring the Senator because of his fearlessness and outspokenness.  He is, of course, ridiculous and Trollope was having a bit of fun by introducing him to the story.	2004-10-29

This is true only to a degree.  The narrative is first person and the writer attempts to imitate Chandler, but the plot is confusing and the ultimate solution is somewhat simplistic and obvious.  The author writes well, but the reader is always flipping to prior chapters to try to figure out who a character is and where the character entered the story.  In sum, this book is good, but not great.	2004-09-14

The book moves along quickly.  You won't be bored ot tempted to put it down.   <br /> <br />Block does a great job confronting Scudder's problems with alcohol, with full descriptions of AA meetings and his AA friends.  You really believe that Scudder is an alcoholic.  Block also frequently mentions the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, a book that Scudder is reading.  Scudder ponders the Meditations as different things happen in the book.  The only slight problem with this book is that the ending is somewhat predictable.   <br /> <br />	2004-07-28

Hibbert always paints a portrait of his subject, rather than discussing every detail of the person's life.  Since most biographers write too much, we should all be grateful to Hibbert.  He does a great job of describing Queen Elizabeth's decisionmaking process, her interactions with her advisors, and her reluctance to marry.  He also explains the religious issues that surrounded the time briefly yet thoughtfully.	2004-07-26

A few things that make Agatha Christie great are: (1) her writing is lean and spare; (2) her characters all have an important role to play; (3) she has a sense of humor; and (4) there are no silly chase scenes or senseless violence.  A thoughtfully written mystery.	2004-07-10

Unlike the Pickwick Papers there is plently of violence as the huge cast of characters is gradually winnowed down.  Many of the deaths are abrupt and comical.  The book is entertaining and unpredictable to say the least.  It is one of the more unpredictable stories I have come across in recent years.	2004-05-31

He also reveals much of himself and what he drew from the relationship.  This is a story of the mentor turning against his protege.<br />Theroux seems to be saying to Naipaul: you don't want me anymore.  Okay, but I'll write a book.  He also mentions the official biography of Naipaul.  Now the official biography of Naipaul will be much more difficult as the biographer will have to spend time on what Theroux said.  <BR>It seems to me that by writing Sir Vidia's Shadow, Theroux will always be Naipaul's shadow.  The two will be linked forever.  This will bother Naipaul very much, and it will be very amusing to Theroux.	2004-05-25

Theroux, skeptical of everything, revisits the Africa he left 30 years before.  Theroux concludes that things are worse in much of Africa and he strongly implies that Western aid; Western Charity and Western Liberal Do-Gooders have accomplished little or nothing in Africa.  They have trained the local people to expect handouts instead of taking care of themselves.  Here he sounds like a conservative Republican.  However, Theroux is especially skeptical of the religious workers in Africa who, in his view, are wasting their time attempting to convert Africans to Christianity to save souls.  This book caused me to rethink the African Charity issue.<BR>As always, Theroux is fresh and unpredictable.  He pokes fun at himself and his life, but he also concludes that his own journey through life has been very rewarding.  You get the sense that no one handed Theroux any breaks in his career.  He feels he had to earn every break he got.<BR>He makes a few references to V.S. Naipaul in the book.  He also interviews Nadine Gordimer, the South African novelist, and paints a portrait of an interesting and courageous woman.	2004-05-10

All nine pose intriguing puzzles for Maigret and his colleagues to solve.  What makes them special is the quality of the writing (just enough words to convey the image and no more) and the subtlety of the author who always seems to add a little bit more to the reader's perception of Maigret.  There are great scenes between Maigret and his wife, Madame Maigret.  Anyone married for any length of time will enjoy these little domestic battles.  There are also some well drawn child characters whose interaction with Maigret is skillfully depicted.  The reader always ends up admiring Maigret for his thoughtfulness and his persistance.  He asks great questions of the witnesses to draw out the story.  This collection of stories is outstanding.	2004-04-08

As usual, she makes fun of Poirot and of some of the other characters.<BR>The ending caught me completely by surprise - it is one the best endings in all of her books.  <BR>Unlike some modern authors, Christie did not pride herself on filling up endless pages.  Her writing is lean and well plotted.  Each scene has a purpose in the story.  There is no excess language or bloated descriptions. She gets to the point quickly.	2004-02-16

What makes Ed McBain special is that he can make a hero out of Fat Ollie Weeks, an overweight policeman who is a bigot.  In this book Fat Ollie's own manuscript is stolen.  There are excellent comments on writing and on how the author (Fat Ollie or McBain) found his &quot;voice.&quot;  The book pokes fun of other McBain novels, of Fat Ollie and of bad writing.  Ultimately, Ed McBain does not take himself, or Fat Ollie, very seriously, which makes for a great story.  Some of the reviewers have misunderstood the cleverness of this book, and that's too bad.	2003-12-16

This book has a very clever plot and keeps the reader on edge until the ending.  The Deaf Man is one of the most interesting characters in McBain's books because he is such an enigma.  <BR>McBain gets right to the point.  He does not waste any words at all on description.  As a reader I have always found his books impossible to put down. Indeed, description would be superfluous.	2003-06-25

The book also has caricatures of the English Lord, The Government Minister, the Rich Widow, the Rich American, and the Faithful Servant.  Underlying the plot is a sense of humor about society.

Nor should anyone doubt that Garrison was an important figure during the time leading up to the Civil War.  However, the book is some 630 pages long and has mountains of minute details about the abolitionist movement.  Every obscure activist is mentioned no matter how unimportant.  I got the feeling that the author wanted to impress readers with the scope of his knowledge about Garrison and the abolitionist movement.<br />In all of the detail, I felt that some of the sense of who Garrison was was lost.  I have read the book and learned a great deal, but the gold nuggets in the story were obscured by all of the details.	2002-09-06

His prose is well-polished and his plot is thoughtfully developed.  However, this book tended to drag a bit because the plot moves were predictable.  It lacked the tension of some of his previous stories like, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy and Single &amp; Single.  The other problem is that the plot was somewhat implausible:  would a big company really go to the trouble of killing people all over the world just to sell its product?  I do not disagree with LeCarre's theme that doctors and scientists should conduct medical research with integrity and fairness, but it seems far-fetched.	2002-06-26

The novels are well-written and easily accessible.  They stories involve families with problems; daughter and mother conflict; child who needs to grow up; and daughter who is not loved by parents.  All three books trace the main character through a long period of time.  The books are somewhat sad.  Things do not go well for these people.  In the end the main character learns and grows and finds a solution to the problem.  The daughter and mother resolve their conflict.  The child who does not grow up learns to grow up the hard way and the daughter who is not loved learns to accept the love of her husband.  <br />These books get to the heart of the conflicts between people and that is valuable.  They are high quality and do not resemble the murder mystery format that the author was famous for.  These books are not high-brow and they are not targeted towards snooty intellectuals.  I recommend them to anyone who wants to see how a good author creates characters and resolves conflicts between characters.	2002-01-21

Rebus has lots of depth.  His problems with alcohol and his family are well documented.  He struggles with his problems, as in previous novels.  This lends a depth to him.  His efforts to determine whether the possible nazi was really a nazi are interesting.  The retired nazi is a well-drawn character with lots of quirks to keep the reader guessing about whether he is or is not a nazi.  The book is well-plotted and is believable.  The writing is solid.	2001-11-04

It is quite good, but it can be a little bit predictable at times.  There are too many fist-fights, which the hero always wins.  Also, the ending is an improbable &quot;deal&quot; between the hero and the villian.

It is not a great book, but it is very good.  The characters, including the main character Tess, are believable people.  No character strikes me as implausible.  The detective work is solid also.  Tess follows leads in a plausible and practical way.  One small flaw is that she spots a car she was looking for by luck.  It takes a while to fine a car.  That small point aside, this book is well-written, fair to all of its characters and entertaining.	2001-10-25

The author seems to be most interested in the period before 1800 or so.  After he reaches 1800 the books drags a bit.  The author thinks the Russian Revolution of 1917 was a bad thing and that it harmed the people of Russia.  I have no reason to quarrel with him.<br />The author does a good job of keeping the story centered around the four or so families whose descendants make up the key characters.  He does an excellent job of explaining the economic problems, particularly those associated with agriculture, that have plagued Russia for all of its history.  <br />Anyone who reads this book should be impressed with the enormous amount of research that went into it.  I learned a great deal about Russia before 1800.  For the period after 1800, there is little here that a well-educated person would not already know.	2001-09-24

I learned a great deal about the city's history from 1920 to 1975.  The authors do a good job in depicting the racial issues that confronted Chicago politicians during that period.  They interviewed people on all sides of the debate, including Daley insiders and some people who protested against Daley.  Their comments about the mayor's efforts to balance the power of various racial and ethnic voting blocks are right on the money.<br />Some reviewers have criticized this book for being too cynical about Daley.  My experiences here suggest the authors are correct.<br />the authors also have a sense of humor about some of the machine's antics.  The book has a sense of fun about it that is helpful.	2001-06-21

It tells an excellent story.  The only weak spot is that McCullough paints Caesar as a &quot;good guy&quot; who just wanted to clear his name when he invaded his own country  and overthrew the lawfully elected government.  This is naive.  She  accepts, without skepticism, the statements of those historians who  apologized for Caesar.  She does not seem to realize that what happened in  Rome in 50 B.C. was a classic military coup.  The toughest general (Caesar)  used his troops to take power.  He is really not much different from  General Pinochet or Colonel Quaddafi.	1999-04-20
