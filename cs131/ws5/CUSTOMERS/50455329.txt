When a person is grieving, or otherwise having a very hard time, what does one say or do without going overboard? This book gives the answer. <br /> <br />Here are some examples. If someone close to you has recently lost a loved one or has been in an accident, send them a card, to express how you feel. Really listen when someone tells you about their day. Call your parents and/or siblings for no reason, other than to say that you love them. Be open to constructive criticism from someone you admire and respect. Read to a child. Call or visit your grandparents and ask them to tell you stories about themselves when they were younger. <br /> <br />Remember someone in your life who has died. Call or visit a person you know who also knew this person and talk about the great times the three of you had together. When invited into someone's home for a gathering, always bring a small gift of appreciation. It is only in the silence that we can hear God's voice. Become your own best friend. This way you will never be lonely. Help an elderly person carry their groceries to the car. Practice patience. Find at least one positive characteristic in everyone you meet. When talking to someone in a wheelchair, lean over or sit down, to be at their eye level. Get involved in at least one \\"cause\\" to make this world a better place. <br /> <br />This is a really good book. At one time or another, everyone will need a book like this, or knows someone who will need a book like this. It's short, with one suggestion per page, it's very easy to read, and it says a lot. Highly recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

He wrote a 300-page dissertation on ferruginous hawks. This book is a shorter, less-scientific version of that dissertation. <br /> <br />Ferruginous hawks are the largest hawk in North America. They are also very shy birds, so they are considered a good barometer for measuring the encroachment of man. Flying away, and abandoning a nest, if people get too close, is possible for them. The author chose to study ferruginous hawks because so little was known about them. <br /> <br />Several nests in southern Idaho and northern Utah were chosen for observation. Some nests are set up in juniper trees, only a few feet off the ground, and some are set up on the ground. Most of the observations had to be done from blinds set up a couple of hundred yards away. The nests are big, anywhere up to several feet across. The hawks, especially the chicks, have developed ways to deal with the sun beating down on their nests (there is no shade nearby). The nests in the trees are not high enough to prevent attacks by predators, especially coyotes, as the author observed one day. <br /> <br />A couple of times, while the adults were away, Powers would climb up to the nests and feed the chicks miniature transmitters. These were intended to measure their internal body temperatures. After excretion, the transmitters were not found at the base of the trees, as expected. Adult hawks pick up bones, caracsses and droppings, and deposit them several hundred yards away, so the smell will not attarct predators. For a time, there was a shortage of jackrabbits (the main food source for the hawks) in the area. Powers was interested in seeing if the hawks would make do with whatever they could find as substitutes, like snakes, rats and lizards. <br /> <br />This is a really interesting book. The author's passion for his work and \\"his\\" hawks shows through everywhere. For those interested in nature and the environment, whether actively or of the armchair variety, this is very much worth reading. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

Worth was totally blown away by the things Fox did that day; he didn't just play the organ (from memory, which was unheard of in the organ world), he mastered the organ. Is there a word beyond \\"virtuoso\\"? That is how good Fox was on the organ. After years of practice, Worth became one of the Fox \\"group\\" and became an organist on his own. <br /> <br />During the 1950s and 1960s, Fox was the organist at the Riverside Church in New York City. His gay lover, Richard Weagly, was the Choir Director. The unpleasant end to their relationship was played out in front of everyone. Fox spent a lot of time on tour, playing in churches and concert halls all over America. After each concert, Fox loved spending hours greeting everyone who stood in line to chat or get an autograph. He was a natural showman who wanted people to know who he was, and demanded to be able to be seen by the audience. <br /> <br />It was also the era of pipe organs (before electronics) where each pipe had to be tuned individually. Fox was extremely picky about the sound of whatever organ he was playing, frequently driving organ tuners nuts. In the late 1960s, Fox was asked to resign from the Riverside Church; he had gotten \\"too big\\" for the Church. <br /> <br />This book chronicles many ups and downs in Fox's life, both personal and professional. To replace Richard, his lover, Fox brought home a much younger man named David. He was not well liked by the people around Fox, including his manager, and David did little to endear himself to the group. In the late 1970s, Fox entered the hospital for a prostate operation. He was told that the whole tumor was removed, and everything was fine. Fox did nothing about it for a year, only to be told that just half the tumor was removed, and the cancer had spread. He died in October 1980. <br /> <br />This is an excellent, but specialized, book. Anyone who is interested in organ music, or the life of Virgil Fox, should read this book. For everyone else, Fox was a person who enjoyed life to the fullest, and it shows here. It is very much recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

This book looks at why democratic societies must respond to things like cloning, genetic engineering and nanotechnology, instead of pretending that they don't exist. <br /> <br />What the author calls \\"bio-Luddites\\" are opposed to such new technologies, because they feel that mankind should be happy with its 70 (or so) years of life, characterized by increasing bodily disfunction in its later stages. Another reason for opposition is the vague, but always there, possibility of a disaster unleashing some new plague on the world. Some people say that taboos and gut feelings are the path to wisdom. If a new technology feels spooky, ban it immediately. The Catholic Church opposes such things because they are supposedly offensive to God. <br /> <br />On the other hand, if a person is found to be a carrier for, or genetically susceptible to, Disease X, don't they have the right to fix their DNA (assuming a safe and reliable method can be found to do so)? Those who call themselves transhumanists (based on humanism) believe that people should have the right to modify their bodies, whether the quest is for greater intelligence, longevity or a happier outlook on life. They are the first to assert that there must be adequate discussion beforehand, and adequate safeguards after the introduction of a new technology. Such things must also be available to all people, through some sort of universal health insurance, not just to the rich. Transhumanists have no desire to take over the world, but one of the subjects for social consideration has to be how to extinguish potential schisms between humans and posthumans. To those who think that some new regulatory agency is needed, the author does not agree. Agencies like the FDA and EPA will be able to do the job, if they ever get the funding and authority needed. Don't forget that 25 years ago, in vitro fertilization wasconsidered an abomination; now it is practically mainstream. <br /> <br />This is a pretty specialized book, but it shouldn't be. Like it or not, the new technologies described in this book are coming in the near future. It is better to start discussing, now, how to deal with them, instead of just saying No. The reader may not agree with everything in this book, but it is an excellent place to begin that discussion. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

Books	5	0	1	N	N	A cautionary tale for small businesses	This is the true story of two women, Margaret (the author) and Angee, who decide to start a woman-owned winery in Indiana. <br /> <br />In general, things go exceptionally well. There are the usual ups and downs as with any startup, but for Margaret and Angee, it's mostly up. They experience double-digit growth each year, their winery becomes known internationally, and their business reputation is excellent. They also go through a number of salespeople, of varying degrees of competence. <br /> <br />After six years of long nights and weekends, and after failing to get financing for expansion, the decision is made to close the winery. Margaret and Angee already had a plan in place to take 90 days to complete the closing. That way, the creditors would be paid, and it could all be done the \\"right\\" way. The bank said No; they wanted their money now. Throughout the whole closing process, the (unnamed) bank exhibits a level of professional incompetence that borders on unreal. At one point in the process, Margaret and Angee are refused entrance to the winery, by the bank, in order to sell bottles of wine already on the shelves to raise money to pay off creditors. At another point, a barrel of unbottled wine has to be dumped because it has gone bad. Margaret and Angee are refused entrance into the winery in order to bottle and sell the wine. <br /> <br />Around this time, Angee contracts an undiagnosed, chronic pain condition that puts her out of action for much of the closing process. A poorly planned auction for the winery's assets is held by the bank. It nets them a couple of percent of the value of the assets; if the bank had followed the Margaret and Angee Plan, they would have received over 90 percent of the value of the winery's assets. <br /> <br /> <br />The reason for the bank's strange behavior is discovered later in the book. They are in trouble with the FDIC over their debt level, and have been told to reduce it, now. The American Dream of entrepreneurship becomes a nightmare of lawyers, bureaucracy and court appearances. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book. It isn't just an interesting startup story, it's also a must-read cautionary tale for all small business owners. Don't assume your bank is one of the Good Guys; prepare yourself, financially, ahead of time. A good place to start is to read this book. At the risk of sounding like a cliche: This could happen to you! <br />	2005-08-17

In its desperation to avoid the Galactic Hegemony, the captain gives Earth a more modern ship out of its inventory. This allows Earth to build more ships, and explore local space. Intelligent life is pretty common, and the only reason Earth hasn't heard about it is their use of inefficient and outdated electromagnetic energy for communication, instead of the much more efficient galactic phloomb. About the only talent humans have, according to the rest of the galaxy, is that of negotiation and arbitration. <br /> <br />Sam Boone works at Earth's major spaceport, near Trenton, New Jersey. It's there because one of the favorite tourist destinations is the nearby city of Hoboken (along with Disneyworld, of course). In one story, Sam must deal with a pair of alien races who decide to settle their differences in a professional wrestling ring, thinking that humans also do it this way. Another popular export for Earth is magazines of any type. Whether it is a home and garden magazine or a mechanical hobby magazine, the other alien races find them absolutely hilarious. In another story, Sam must escort a pair of aliens around Disneyworld. This wouldn't seem so difficult, except these are group mind aliens, where one individual inhabits 20 or 30 separate bodies. Do they get a group discount on tickets? In each of these stories, Sam must deal with very different cultural values, while keeping his alien boss happy and keeping himself out of some potentially disastrous situations. <br /> <br />There is a sad lack of humor in science fiction. This book helps to fill the gap. For lighter, humorous reading that is still well written, this is very much worth checking out. <br /> <br />	2005-07-31
US	50455329	RSU376OUWXND9	0399152601	844067670	Don't Eat This Book	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Very highly recommended	From the person behind the documentary Supersize Me, this book looks at the fast food industry in America. He explores the ways in which fast food is marketed to children, the supersizing of the fast food menu and the accompanying rise in conditions like obesity, heart disease and diabetes, even among children. <br /> <br />The average school cafeteria has replaced its food with sugary and sweet items like pizza and soda, that is, if the cafeteria hasn't actually been turned into a food court. Cash-strapped schools are obligated to let soda and candy vending machines in school, for a cut of the money, while physical education is being eliminated. Diabetes is supposed to be an \\"adult\\" disease; in the last few years, it has started to show up in children under 10 years old. Most nutritionists recommend limiting fast food to no more than once a month. How many people, or families, can honestly say that they can do that? In 2005, obesity related diseases will come close to smoking as the biggest killer of Americans; the estimate is that 400,000 people will die from such diseases. As an experiment, put a plate of McDonald's fries under glass, for several months. What will happen to the fries? The answer is: basically nothing. They might start to smell, but there will be little or no decomposition to the fries. One can only wonder what is in the fries or the vegetable oil to cause this to happen. <br /> <br />Part of this book is also a chronicle of his 30 days on the \\"McDonald's Diet\\" for the film. He got three different doctors to independently keep an eye on his health, which basically fell apart. He suffered bad headaches and chest pains, he couldn't focus mentally and his cholesterol and blood pressure rose dramatically. Oh, and he also gained more than 24 pounds. <br /> <br />A measure of liver function is the presence of an enzyme in the blood called serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT). During his month of McDonald's food, his number rose from 20 to 290; under 40 is normal. Another enzyme to measure liver function is alanine transaminase (ALT); his number skyrocketed from 17 to 471, before settling at 240. Again, under 40 is normal. Is it any wonder that a child born in 2000 has a 1 in 3 chance of developing diabetes from poor dietary habits? <br /> <br />This is a gem of a book. Filled with lots of information for all Americans, it is very easy to read, and is helped with bits of humor that Spurlock spreads all over the book. This is very highly recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-07-29

It is supposed to do this through enforcing a system of standards and accountability through standardized testing. According to the authors in this book, NCLB actually hurts, instead of helps, children, especially urban children. <br /> <br />The biggest problem is that NCLB has been underfunded, by anywhere up to $12 billion. The states have all sorts of new federal mandates, but not enough money to pay for them. Standardized tests are valuable as a measure of a student's progress, but they should not be the only measure, which is the case with NCLB. Portions of the school curriculum that don't directly deal with testing, like art, phys ed and field trips, will be dropped, as schools become little more than test-prep factories. <br /> <br />A school can be classified as Failing if even one subgroup in the school, like Asains or disabled students, don't do well enough on the test. The school must then pay to bus its students who want to transfer to a non-failing school. If it is an inner-city school, their resources are already thin enough. There probably aren't any non-failing schools nearby, and besides, they have no incentive to accept students who might bring down their test scores. Urban schools, and urban communities in general, need a lot more help than to be told, \\"Raise your test scores, or else.\\" Many schools have gotten in the habit of making students repeat a grade, raising the chance that they will eventually drop out, only because they might negatively affect the test score for the upper grade. <br /> <br />The most well-known non-education provision in NCLB forces schools to give student contact information to military recruiters, or face a cutoff of federal aid. Any policy that prevents participation in prayer in public schools, as well as any policy that prohibits the Boy Scouts or any other \\"patriotic society\\" access to school facilities. For these and many other reasons, the list of states refusing to follow NCLB is growing. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book. It shows that the public pronouncements about NCLB are much brighter than the reality. It's short, easy to read and highly recommended <br /> <br />	2005-07-28

He is paired with a bruising hulk named Scarlatti, who keeps talking jailbreak. With the help of a man named Burks, the jailbreak is successful. Hibbert is brought along against his will, so he won't blab to the authorities. Heading for the Florida Everglades, they hook up with Carlotta, Scarlatti's girlfriend. <br /> <br />In the middle of nowhere, the four come across a golden stairway into the sky. They ascend, and find a giant pool which may be The Fountain of Youth, guarded by a blue flamingo. It attacks them, and doesn't last long after several shots from Burks' pistol. They ascend another stairway to a land called Khoire. <br /> <br />It is something like being inside an M.C. Escher drawing. They meet a man named Patur, who has each of them put a crystal mask to their faces, which shows their true feelings. They are told that they will change into whatever their true essence is within 24 hours, and that they cannot stay in Khoire. Burks volunteers to turn into a blue flamingo, to take the place of the one he destroyed. He'll accept being on the doorstep of Khoire, and do whatever is necessary to get himself an invitation back to Khoire. Carlotta and Scarlatti experience their Change; it is not pretty, and they end up eaten by a large carnivore. Meantime, Hibbert has fallen head over heels in love with Mareth of the Watchers. His Change is relatively minor; he is still very much human. He returns to Earth, passing Burks the flamingo. Hibbert's quest is to find those people, who cannot reveal themselves beforehand, who will help him do what is needed to get his own invitation to Khoire. <br /> <br />First published in greatly shortened form in 1948, this is an excellent piece of writing. Bok was best known as an artist and illustrator during the pulp era; this shows that he was also a fine writer. If the reader can find a copy of this novel, it is very much recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-07-26

A friend of her mother, Willa Carson, agrees to take Miranda on a trip to Peru to visit sites like Macchu Picchu. Her parents aren't exactly thrilled at the idea, but they agree. On the way to Peru, the plans change. The two women join an expedition led by a woman named Margot, looking for a city called Tanum. It's inside an Andean mountain and is the home of an ancient civilization called the Ugha Mongulala. On the plane to Peru, Miranda has a dream. Her friend, Opal Courtright, now part of a higher consciousness being called Sappho (read part 1), tells Miranda that they will meet in Tanum. <br /> <br />After several days travel through impenetrable Andean jungle, the entrance to Tanum is found. While exploring subterranean tunnels, an earthquake strikes and Miranda is badly injured. The people of Ugha Mongulala come to the rescue, bring the three women to Tanum, and nurse Miranda back to health. There is enough light and fresh air in this underground city to support 2,000 people; they have been on Earth for thousands of years, and went underground to escape \\"white barbarians.\\" Meantime, the earthquake that injured Miranda wasn't just an earthquake. It was part of a worldwide catastrophe that included, among other things, Earth's rotation stopping for three full days. <br /> <br />Miranda attracts the attention of an ethereal, androgynous, even more ancient, race called the Els, who take Miranda into another realm for a visit. She is given all sorts of ancient knowledge and wisdom, which she, in turn, is to preach to the people of Earth. When the three women are returned to \\"reality,\\" Miranda is compelled to go into the jungle alone, following her own path. <br /> <br />Those who are interested in New Age concepts, like higher states of consciousness and ancient civilizations, will love this book. Foreveryone else, it's grounded enough in reality, and weird enough, to be very much recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-07-23

One manifestation of that Covenant is that the ruler of Keaen can not marry or even have a lover. Heirs to the throne are created by the ruler impregnating any woman in the kingdom that he wishes. If a male child is born, that child is taken from the mother and spends his life in the castle. Armist is very uninterested in taking over as ruler, because he believes himself to be the product of such a union. His sister, Tahlia, is about to be married off to one of the local barons, a prospect that she equally dreads. <br /> <br />In Keaen, opposition to the Covenant is growing. Would-be rebels start to organize, semi-openly. One huge push is all that is needed to bring down the whole system. Armist and Tahlia aren't thinking about that when they flee the castle, throwing everything into chaos. They just want to get as far away as possible. Along the way, Armist and Tahlia find that they have friends within the castle. <br /> <br />Caitlan is the royal Weaponsmaster and Pandrak is the emissary of the magices of Skele (the head wizard). They have their reasons for wanting the system changed, so, in their own ways, they keep the pursuit away from Armist and Tahlia. Naturally, their father, King Hain, is not taking this lying down; their freedom doesn't last for long. Tahlia is forced into marriage with Baron Tegel, a fat, disgusting man with an unnatural liking for young boys. Armist is captured by forces loyal to Tergan, Keaen's neighbor and long-time enemy. <br /> <br />This one is very good. It's more of an adventure tale with narrow escapes, knife fights and carnivorous beings who come out at night. It may take some work on the part of the reader, but this is recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-07-16

But the elders have been hiding a big secret. They were exiled from the planet Karna, their actual home, for using their Conrad (telepathy and telekinesis) abilities. <br /> <br />Xavier, a hothead who wants to be the next Conrad leader, convinces a group of young people to join him on a mission to Karna, to ask for permission to return, and if that doesn't work, to exact some retribution. <br /> <br />Xavier rules by fear and intimidation. The basic rules are: do what Xavier says, or die. The people of Karna live in isolated clans, so killing them is easy. Meantime, back on Aleron, a group of older Conrads, followers of the Light, decide to go after Xavier's group, to bring them back home. They help rebuild the villages of Karna that were destroyed. Along the way, after the first attack, Xavier's group stops on another planet to build more ships. Xavier finds a race of small, red, scaly animals on the planet. Through genetic manipulation and more mental powers, they are changed into a race of large, red, scaly warriors whose only purpose is to follow Xavier. He sends a plague back to Aleron, unknowingly carried by Thera, his soul mate, that kills all the other Conrads, except Bruner, the leader. Those who are trying to stop Xavier see his \\"handiwork,\\" up close and personal, and are devastated. Killing another being, especially hundreds of the small, red creatures is totally against Conrad teaching. <br /> <br />This book belongs in that large gray area of Pretty Good or Worth Reading. It is an interesting story, perhaps a little on the \\"quiet\\" side and with room for a sequel. Overall, the reader will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />	2005-07-15

But that's easy for Govil to do. <br /> <br />Earth of the 31st Century is a very strange sort of place. There are no births or deaths; everyone is immortal. Everyone is sterile, because things like sex and families have been outlawed; so have war, disease and famine. All of mankind's needs are taken care of by Genie Corp (the only corporation on Earth), makers of biological Creature Comforts. Among their creations are JohnDeer, a multi-headed deer used as a lawn mower, an AlarmCock, the head of a rooster with little feet and HeavenScent, a skunk that sprays air freshener. Therefore, it is nothing for Govil to create a deliberately average human. The hard part is keeping it quiet. <br /> <br />Eve's education is left in the hands of an obsolete robot named Pentser, the narrator of this book. Years later, after Eve is able to function on her own, she is told the truth about her origins. By this time, Govil has fallen for her. The not-very-diligent investigation finally learns the truth, and the three are hauled into court. While Eve is sentenced to be recycled, it is revealed that Govil is not the only one with a secret \\"relationship.\\" <br /> <br />This one is pretty good. It's a good future social speculation mixed with a 19th Century romance and includes some very weird bits of genetic engineering. Get past the strange front cover, and this one is worth reading. <br /> <br />	2005-07-14
US	50455329	R1VL9MR9SPD0Z6	1892669331	271181814	God Drug	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Really strange and really good	Tom and Sparrow, his lover, are part of the punk music scene in present-day Gainesville, Florida. Sparrow is part of a band that has a gig at Dave-O's, the local punk music club. Earlier that day, they score some LSD, that was not meant for them, from Galactic Bill, the local drug source.<br /><br />Meantime, near Atlanta, Georgia, a young woman named Hanna wakes up in a suburban house next to a fat, hairy guy. She has no memory of who she is or how she got there, except for flashbacks of having served in the Vietnam War, even though she is nowhere near old enough to have served. Hanna gets in a car and heads south, not knowing where she is going. Along the way, she meets The General, an older man in uniform who certainly remembers Hanna.<br /><br />When they reach Gainesville, Hanna realizes that The General is some sort of alien whose task is to absorb certain people, and thereby become part of Jovah. She realizes this after seeing The General swallow Galactic Bill whole, like a snake eating a rat. Back at the punk club, the LSD begins to have an effect, and suddenly, everyone at the club is flying, as long as the music keeps playing. When a malfunctioning amp stops the music, gravity takes over, violently. While in the air, Tom, Sparrow and their friends watch as a giant mechanical dragon lays waste to Gainesville, like a modern-day Godzilla movie. They can't help but think that this is the ultimate drug trip, but this is reality (that's the magic word). They meet Hanna and The General, who must absorb Hanna to become \\"whole.\\"<br /><br />This book does a fine job at messing with conceptions of reality. One can almost hear the punk music in the background. This one is really strange and really good.	2005-07-12

The author is not talking about any particular conception of God, but means \\"God\\" as a more general term. People discovered many of these Laws (Known Law) through spiritual reflection and scientific experimentation. Among the major Natural Laws are basic morality, individual freedom, change and the progress and consequences that result from that change. As time went on, leadership and social organization came about. Religions developed to help explain man's place in the overall scheme of things. <br /> <br />The major religions were established using the same general concepts of morality, like right and wrong, good and evil, etc. The author advocates the creation of a society based on these spiritual concepts, which are common to everyone, instead of basing it on any particular God. <br /> <br />How can entrenched power happen in present-day religion? They are part of the social fabric that organizes people into effective societies. On the local level, they teach moral and ethical values. They support the development of good character in children. They provide understanding and comfort in times of loss. As one goes up the hierarchy (a feature of most organized religions), leaders are more interested in the organization and holding on to power than in serving the faithful. An example of entrenched power is the Catholic Church molestation scandals. It would have been painful to deal with the problem years ago, but sweeping it under the rug, as the Catholic hierarchy did, has made the problem many times worse. <br /> <br />On the subject of entrenched power in politics, need we say more than \\"term limits?\\" A major flaw in the system as designed by the Founding Fathers was not setting a limit on terms in Congress. The author advocates a system where average citizens can actually run for Congress (currently impossible), serve two terms, then make way for someone else. It would go a long way toward helping America to lead the world toward the fulfillment of \\"God's\\" destiny for Man. <br /> <br />This is quite a book. It's a really interesting read for people of any political or religious viewpoint. The reader may not agree with all of it, but it is still well worth reading. <br /> <br />	2005-07-08
US	50455329	R2P45Z5PL2LFE5	0441009778	673832066	Guardian	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Very good but very "quiet" reading	Written as a memoir, much of this book takes place in 19th Century America. Rosa Coleman was a part of high society in Philadelphia. After witnessing her husband sodomizing Daniel, their young son, she picked him up and fled across uncharted America by train and steamboat. Pinkerton detectives working for her husband were never far behind. <br /> <br />Months later, they found themselves in San Francisco, heading to Alaska to look for gold. Alaska was also as far way from Philadelphia as Rosa and Daniel could go. They were in the company of Doc and Charles, an older man and his son, also looking to strike it rich. Rosa and Doc hit it off, by 19th Century standards, pretty quickly. The only strange thing about Rosa and Daniel's journey was that every so often a raven would come down out of the sky, land in front of them, and squawk the words \\"No gold\\" before leaving. <br /> <br />Rosa decided to stay in the town of Sitka, rather than join the men in the Alaskan wilderness. She got a job as a schoolteacher, and met Gordon, part Russian priest and part shaman. They are both there to teach, and hopefully convert, the local Tlingit (native) children. The raven is considered a trickster in many cultures, including Tlingit. <br /> <br />After several months, Rosa received a letter from Charles saying that Doc and Charles were shot and killed in a streetcorner dispute. In a fit of despair, Rosa took out a pistol that she kept for protection, and was prepared to use it on herself. At that moment, a talking raven, part Gordon and part trickster, flew into her cabin and took her on a journey. She visited a planet of man-sized, mobile, intelligent plants. She visited a planet whose sun was stationary in the sky. She visited a devastated Times Square, far in her future. She was turned into a golden eagle, and into a carnivorous dinosaur. Rosa was taught all about alternate universes, and was returned to one where Doc and Daniel were still alive, because they hadn't yet made thetrip into the Alaskan wilderness. <br /> <br />This is an excellent novel, but a pretty \\"quiet\\" novel. The science fiction doesn't start until about the last quarter of the story. By the end, it gets nice and weird, and will give the reader plenty to consider. Two thumbs up.    <br />	2005-06-23
US	50455329	RS5APTGSB69ZO	0441012388	472493966	Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Very good Revelation Space stories	The first of these two novellas, set in the author's *Revelation Space* universe, is about an alien tower, obviously part of a long-dead civilization, on a desolate planet. Decomposed bodies and body parts around the base show that extreme care is a very good idea. A man named Childe assembles a group of people to explore the tower from the inside, including Richard Swift, an old friend, and Doctor Trintingnant. The doctor is famous, or infamous, for removing organs or limbs from people, and replacing them with their artificial equivalent, not always with the patient's consent. Therefore, he experimented on his only willing patient, himself. <br /> <br />The tower consists of a series of rooms. Entrance to the next room is gained by solving a very high-level mathematical puzzle. After a while, the tower begins to impose a time limit on the decision-making process. After retreating from one disastrous room, where one member is killed, and several limbs are chopped off (happily replaced by the doctor), the rest of the group says no more. Childe and Swift determine that artificial limbs and organs are less prone to attack by the tower than organic, so they have Dr. T turn them into something like an artificial greyhound dog, and return to the tower. In examining the bodies around the base of the tower, the doctor determines that, genetically, they all come from the same person. The question is also raised as to how Childe knew just what sort of people would be needed to explore the tower, if, as he claims, this is his first visit. <br /> <br />The second story takes place on Turquoise, a planet whose ocean is inhabited by Pattern Jugglers, a one-celled aquatic organism capable of recording the memories of any being who joins their collective consciousness. Naqi Okpik is among those studying the Jugglers, until Mina, her sister, becomes part of the Juggler consciousness. <br /> <br />One day, an interstellar trading vessel stops by for a visit, a once-in-a-lifetime event for the isolated people of Turquoise. One of the ship's crew, a man named Weir, is acting very strangely. During a tour of the Juggler research station, the rest of the crew attacks, and takes over the station. It seems that many years before, a despot named Ormozd visited the planet, and was absorbed by the Pattern Jugglers. The intention of the attackers is to \\"download\\" Ormozd's memories from the Jugglers, and place them into several different people. This is what Weir has come to stop. He takes a boat into a node of Jugglers, with Naqi in hot pursuit. He carries with him a \\"bomb\\" to destroy the Juggler's memory storage capability, and also to destroy the memories of everyone ever absorbed by the Jugglers, including Mina, Naqi's sister. <br /> <br />This is another first-rate piece of writing from Reynolds. It would be a good idea to read any of his *Revelation Space* books first. These novellas are interesting, very well done and highly recommended. <br />	2005-06-21

The initial thought is that it comes from one of the planets or moons in this system, or that it's some previously unknown pulsar or other interstellar noise maker. All that is known about the source of the signal is that it is 50 light years away, and that it is heading in Earth's general direction. For a few weeks, the signal is lost; when it is regained, \\"it\\" is only 30 light years away, and still heading generally toward Earth. All known attempts to decipher the signal fail; the possibility is that the signal is internal, from ship to ship, and not meant as a message to another species. <br /> <br />Meantime, an ambitious American state senator latches on to the issue as a way to propel himself to Washington. Using some very questionable science, and some huge jumping to conclusions, he does a fine job of changing the public's focus from Unexplained Signal From Space to ALIEN INVASION! Panic and rioting spreads all over the world. (If this really is an invasion, how is stealing anything not already nailed down going to help?) The initial government and military response is to look like they are doing something (it's probably nothing, or this will quickly blow over). By this time, \\"it\\" is less than ten light years away, and still heading toward Earth. <br /> <br />An obsolete space station, already in orbit, is retrofitted with appropriate engines and sent to the edge of the solar system. All they can do is to make themselves as noticeable as possible, and hope the aliens stop and have a look. They do stop, but First Contact ends up being rather anticlimactic.  <br /> <br />This one is really good. The first of a four-part series, it focuses more on the people involved than on the science or the Contact part. It's a strong, well-done piece of writing. <br />	2005-05-17

A companion to the recently released DVD called \\"American Jobs,\\" this book shows that the reality of free trade is nowhere near as bright as the promise. <br /> <br />If free trade in general, and CAFTA in particular, is such a wonderful thing, then a few questions come to mind. Part of the attraction of free trade is that people in Latin America are going to start buying lots of US-made products, leading to new jobs here in America. How is that going to happen when the trend in wages is very much downward, to see who can reach the bottom first? It takes years, and higher wages, to create any sort of consumer society in Latin America. If high American wages are an \\"inefficiency\\" to be gotten rid of as soon as possible, who is going to buy all those hundred-dollar sneakers and wide-screen TVs? Where are all these new industries for which laid-off American workers are supposed to retrain? <br /> <br />NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and outsourcing in general, has led to a large loss of jobs. In the 21st century, over 3 million American manufacturing jobs are gone, never to return. According to one estimate, almost 900,000 jobs headed to Mexico because of NAFTA. Those maquiladora jobs are now leaving Mexico and going to China, where the wages are even lower. Over 1.5 million Mexican farmers have been forced off the land because of cheap (and subsidized) American agricultural imports. The same thing will happen in Central America if CAFTA comes into effect. None of those displaced farmers are going to head north and illegally enter America? <br /> <br />This is an excellent book. It doesn't go into much detail (that's not the intention), but it gives the reader plenty to consider. It is written in easy-to-understand language, so even those who know nothing about free trade can understand it. Overall, it is very highlyrecommended. <br />	2005-04-21

This book presents a number of facts, with accompanying essays, that will not be covered on the evening news. <br /> <br />In 2002, more than 80 percent of the world's executions took place in just three countries, China, Iran and America. Black men born in the US stand a one in three chance of going to jail, while white men have a one in seventeen chance of going to jail. Because of the Asian preference for male over female babies, and because of China's one-child policy, China has 44 million missing women. Over one-fifth of the world's population lives on less than one dollar a day. One-third of the world's obese people, and over 80 percent of the smokers, live in developing countries. <br /> <br />Did you know that nearly half of Americans believe that aliens have landed on Earth? According to one estimate, there are over 67,000 lobbyists in Washington, which equals 125 for each member of Congress. Ten languages disappear every year. Every year, America spends $10 billion on pornography, the same amount it spends on foreign aid. More than 70 percent of the world has never heard a dial tone. <br /> <br />This book also includes sources for each of the essays, and organizations to contact for those who are inspired to get involved in any of these areas. It is excellent, and I enjoyed reading it. Compare the subjects in this book to what is shown on the \\"all-news\\" channels. To get a very different view of the world, this is a fine place to start. <br /> <br />	2005-04-16

A sequel to her novel This is The Place, about growing up Mormon in Utah, these stories are part recollections by older members of the family, and part things that actually happened to the author when she was younger. <br /> <br />During a drive in the country with her parents, the author got to watch an old-fashioned cow milking, up close and personal. Another story took place during the Depression, when any scrap of cloth was saved to be made into some piece of clothing. There are stories about this grandmother or that aunt, moving to Utah as a young woman. Included are tales of family secrets passed from one generation to the next. <br /> <br />Every family has stories like these. I enjoyed reading this book. The stories are very easy to read, touching, poignant and humorous. If this book gets the reader to start thinking about their own family history, it will have succeeded.

She bought everything she could find by him, and wore out the albums due to playing them over and over. A budding songwriter, she and her boyfriend recorded several songs on reel-to-reel tape and sent them to Zappa.<br /><br />Months went by, until the phone call came asking if they could stop by at the offices of Zappa's record label. That would be enough for most people, but to realize that Zappa actually listened to the tape was overwhelming. His general opinion was that she didn't stink, but that she wasn't ready yet. On thing led to another, and a trip to the Zappa residence led to an invitation to be a substitute guitarist on his next tour.<br /><br />On tour, Zappa rarely, if ever, indulged in the alcohol and drugs that are part of any tour, if only to keep that boss/employee distance. He was obsessive/compulsive and a perfectionist who, because of constant stomach problems, drank kaopectate by the gallon. Lennon's time on the tour was rather short, only a couple of months. Zappa sent her home after word got to Mrs. Zappa that their relationship wasn't exactly platonic.<br /><br />Time went by, and after Lennon got thrown out of the house (the relationship with her parents was not good), she was able to crash in the basement of the Zappa residence, on the understanding that she not disturb him while he was composing. He had been seriously injured at a concert in England, and, physically and emotionally, things had changed. The arrangement lasted for a while, until Zappa went back on tour.<br /><br />More time went by, and Lennon attempted to continue her music studies at a local college. She again ran into Zappa while he was rehearsing a grand, orchestral piece called The Great Wazoo. She tried to be as helpful as possible, while also learning as much as possible. Zappa seemed to tolerate her, more than he actually wanted her around. The relationship between them ends badly.<br /><br />Zappa fans should read this book.

US	50455329	R31SAOX60IFPID	0932863353	5435739	CAPITALIST PUNISHMENT	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Excellent book on prisons	Prison privatization has become a major public policy issue over the last few years, in America and around the world. Advocates say that private corporations can run prisons better and cheaper than the state. According to the contributors to this book, the promise is much greater than the reality. <br /> <br />Prison corporations cut costs as much as possible, affecting things like education and rehabilitation programs for prisoners, staff salaries and training, which leads to a high yearly turnover of guards. An obstacle to greater privatization of prisons has been the power of prison guard unions. The cost savings don't go to the local government, but to the corporate office, where executives draw huge salaries. On more than one occasion, the state has had to take back control of a prison from a corporation, because of deaths in custody, or violations of prisoners' human rights, including those of juveniles. <br /> <br />Blacks and Native Americans are in prison in numbers far higher than their proportion of the general population, because prison is a method of social control more than a way to make the streets safer. Private prisons make little or no attempt to incorporate native traditions, like sweat lodges, into the rehabilitation process. Putting prisons far away from cities, or shipping prisoners to other states, disrupts the family structure back home, leading to more children growing up without one or both parents. Women, and people with diagnosed medical conditions, also do not get their needs taken into account by private prisons. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book. The writing gets rather dry and academic, so it will take some work on the part of the general reader; by all means, stay with it. It is well worth reading, for those involved with prisons and for the general public. <br /> <br />	2005-04-14

This book looks at one family's journey through such a process. <br /> <br />One of a parent's biggest wishes for their child is that they find something about which they are passionate, something on which they can build a life. For the parent, there is a fine line between passion and obsession, a line that is easy to cross. <br /> <br />It's hard to instill a love of books if the children don't have access to them. Regularly bring them to the local library, and let them take out a lot of books. If Child 2 doesn't progress in reading at the same rate as did Child 1, don't panic. Everyone progresses at their own speed. <br /> <br />Another way to instill a love of books is to set aside a reading period during the day. While the child reads a book, the parent should sit and read an adult book. The child will probably enter a phase in which they are interested in what the parent considers the children's literature equivalent of trash. Again, don't panic; they'll grow out of it. <br /> <br />Have faith in your child, especially if they are progressing too \\"slowly.\\" Encouragement that the pieces will eventually fall into place is better than pushing. Realize that your children are individuals with different styles of reading. <br /> <br />Also included is a long list of reading suggestions for children of all ages. This book is a gem. It's very down to earth, and any parent can identify with it. For those parents worried that their child isn't reading \\"fast enough,\\" take a deep breath, then read this book. It's time very well spent. <br /> <br />	2005-04-14

Girls were never an important part of their lives while growing up. Their decision to live together as a gay couple, while not exactly a surprise, elicits two very different family reactions, the subject of this book. <br /> <br />The Moss family comes from a lower-middle class background, and always placed the health and well-being of their children above material possessions, anyway. If Barnaby is happy as a gay person, that's all that matters. The Kotkin's live in Belle Harbor, the rich part of town. Thelma, Arnie's mother, is a social climber with an inordinate interest in what others think of the family. Arnie's coming out is an absolute disaster, for her, and she lets Arnie know it. She can just imagine the whispering that will go on around town, now that they have a . . .queer in the family. <br /> <br />A few days later, Arnie is informed that his father has had a heart attack. Rushing to the hospital with Barnaby, and Helene and Jack Fentnor, Arnie's aunt and uncle who are visiting, they are confronted by Jimmy, one of Arnie's brothers. He is a medical student at the hospital and very much takes after his mother in being a self-centered jerk. He takes great exception to Barnaby's presence, and, in front of everyone, takes out a gun and shoots Barnaby, wounding him in the shoulder. <br /> <br />The incident becomes news, jeopardizing Arnie's teaching job at the local elementary school. Barnaby is released after a couple of days (HMO). Thelma begins to realize that there is more to life than worrying about the opinion of others. A few days later, another tragedy strikes the Kotkin family. Freddie and Jerry, Arnie's other brothers, were in a car that was deliberately forced off the road by another car. Freddie escaped with minor injuries, but Jerry was killed. Arnie and Barnaby decide that they had better do some fast crime solving, because someone has certainly targeted the Kotkin family. Amid everything else, Helene and Jack let Arnie in on some deep, dark family secrets. <br /> <br />This isn't just a good \\"gay novel,\\" or a good mystery or a good story about family secrets, it's a really good novel, overall. It moves easily, and will certainly keep the reader involved. <br />	2005-04-14

According to this book, nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br />It is actually a product of the union between chlorine, which is a poisonous gas, and sodium, which is a reactive metal that bonds with other elements to make new compounds. The human body needs a tiny amount of sodium each day, so adopting a totally sodium-free diet is not a good idea. The average person consumes up to ten times the required amount of sodium each day. (The *2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans*, produced by the federal government, recommends consuming no more than 2,300 mg of sodium, about 1 tablespoon, per day.) <br /> <br />Those with hypertension (high blood pressure) need to take a very hard look at their salt intake. The kidneys, which have a major role in hypertension, should be able to take care of just as much salt as we ingest. But for millions of people, the kidneys cannot process the excessive amounts of sodium ingested each day. The fluid buildup which results leads to increased blood volume, which leads to higher blood pressure, which leads to a faster heartbeat. The blood being pumped through the body is too great a quantity to nourish the tissues, not to mention the heart beating too hard and fast for its own good. Through a process of autoregulation, the blood vessels shrink to reduce blood flow. That's what high blood pressure is all about. <br /> <br />The American addiction to salt, planted by the food industry, starts with baby food, among the most nutrition-poor and sodium- and sugar-rich foods in the supermarket. Sodium nitrite, present in all processed meat, is another way that sodium is added to our diet. Don't forget about MSG, monosodium glutamate, present in many packaged and canned foods. <br /> <br />Consumers need to read nutrition labels, and see just how much sodium there is in things like, for instance, milk and store-bought cookies. Stay away from canned soup; it is possible to get one-third to one-half of the daily 2,300 mg mentioned above in one can of soup. Finally, cut your salt intake, starting with removing that salt shakerfrom the kitchen table at meal time. Learn how to cook without adding more salt. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book. If you can find a copy, it is easy to read, and in this health-conscious world, it is highly recommended. <br />	2005-02-24

Ona, Twoa, Threa and Foraa (seriously) are supposed to be the pinnacle of humanity, but their personalities never caught up with their bodies. During a private dinner at Ona's private compound, attempting to patch up disagreements between them (which have grown to the size of the Grand Canyon), Foraa falls to the floor, dead, and apparently poisoned. <br /> <br />Enter Zachary Nixon Johnson, the world's last freelance private investigator. The wine Foraa was drinking when she collapsed tests negative for all known poisons. An autopsy on Foraa is impossible because her skin, like that of her sisters, is impregnable to outside objects, including scalpels, saws, and even lasers used on asteroids. Johnson, who is assisted in his investigation by HARV, the world's most sophisticated supercomputer hardwired into his brain, doesn't lack for suspects. <br /> <br />Perhaps the killer was aiming for Ona (she inherited all of Daddy's money when he died, and has become an arrogant, overbearing you-know-what) and miscalculated. After much investigation, and narrowly surviving an attack by a cybernetic suit of armor, Johnson feels the case is solved. During what is supposed to be the climatic scene, where the hardboiled PI calls together all the suspects in order to reveal the murderer, Johnson gets a call from the morgue. Foraa has woken up, gotten off the autopsy table and left. The final battle of the book takes place in a New Vegas casino that happens to be built on top of a real doomsday device, built by Daddy before he died. <br /> <br />Fans of hardboiled detective novels will enjoy this story; science fiction fans will also enjoy it. The authors do a fine job throughout and this is well worth reading. <br />	2005-02-03

From one brain to another without any literary rules or standards; the words in these automatic writings are not just words, but rays of subconscious illumination that peel away the various layers of the `civilized,' western psyche, one by one.\\" <br /> <br /> For those who understand what that means, and are interested in such writing, read no further; buy this book. For everyone else, these are not stories in the usual sense. They are collections of strange images where bizarre things happen right next to each other. In just the first story, a thin stream of sugar is dropped into a tiger's eyeball, a frog burps a shiny platinum marble, there is a talking caterpillar, and an umbrella reveals a family sunning themselves on the shore of an island continent formed from green volcanic glass deposited hundreds of thousands of years ago. <br /> <br /> This book is very much not for everyone. For those who want to give their brain a workout, this is an excellent choice. For those who want \\"normal\\" books with plot and characters and all those English Literature words, this book can be skipped.	2004-12-01

Looking for more from life than the usual 9 to 5 job, Jake takes off for a year of traveling around America. He also figures that, as a would-be writer, he should have some experiences worth writing about. <br /> <br />Jake is one of those who likes his liquor and drugs, and has something of a gambling problem. After the obligatory stop in Las Vegas, he ends up in Phoenix to look up some lady friends from back home, known for throwing legendary parties. While he spends nights on their couch, he is forced to get a job. He becomes a supervisor for a group of mall kiosks that encourage people to enter a contest for a free weekend at a hotel in Mexico. Actually, it is little more than a telemarketing scam. After a few months, Jake again gets the urge to hit the open road and heads north toward Portland, Oregon. <br /> <br />Hiking on Mt. Hood, Jake has an epiphany. Sitting down to read Walden by Henry David Thoreau, Jake has the realization that Thoreau wrote the book for Jake, at that moment. If Jake didn't have to get back home for the marriage of Paul, his best friend, the thought of staying in Portland was mighty tempting. The bride-to-bride doesn't like her fiance's friends, including Jake, but the guys are going to celebrate, anyway. Driving to pick up a friend in town, to bring him back to the party, Jake is arrested for DUI. Since the arraignment isn't for several weeks, Jake gets in his car and heads for Baltimore. <br /> <br />He gets a job at a local restaurant, and is able to sleep at a local youth hostel for free, due to a loophole in their system. After the charges are dropped back home, Jake heads for Key West. His fellow employees at a local restaurant are from several different countries. Almost none of them speak English, but they all manage to understand each other. Key West is a place that turns into one big party at night. The cocaine and alcohol flowlike water. Jake can hold his own as a partier, but staying up all night, every night, begins to take its toll. Part of the reason for the journey is to sort out his feelings toward Jane, his girlfriend, who is willing to wait for him. <br /> <br />This is much more than just a drunken, drug-filled chronicle of one person's journey around America. Jake sees the best and worst in people, in unexpected places. This story is full of heart and soul and intelligence. It is well worth reading. <br /> <br />	2004-11-30

This book looks at what would have happened if just a few things were changed during the Civil War. On May 12, 1863, near Vicksburg, Mississippi, General Ulysses S. Grant is killed in a freak equestrian accident. This seems to take the wind out of the Army of Tennessee, whose expedition had started earlier that year with such promise, but whose fortunes had been getting worse and worse. The remaining Union forces surrender to the Confederate Army at Vicksburg. Farther north, the Battle of Gettysburg truns into a defeat (perhaps slaughter is a better word) for the Union forces, who surrender to Robert E. Lee. <br /> <br />Word reaches President Abraham Lincoln that the end is near. On July 4, 1863, he and his family flee the White House at night, in the back of a horse-drawn ice truck. His first destination is Richmond, Virginia, where he is the \\"guest\\" of president Jefferson Davis. There is little or no looting of Washington by the advancing Confederate forces, though a number of White House items somehow make their way into Confederate homes. The looting is done by the citizens of Washington, whose name is changed from District of Columbia to District of Dixie. <br /> <br />America is given a chance to move the offices and documents out of Washington, and they eventually end up in the new capital of Columbus, Ohio, which is renamed Columbia. Seward's Folly, the purchase of Alaska from Russia, never happens. Throughout all of this, Texas remains independent. <br /> <br />In 1898, a Confederate battleship is blown up in Havana Harbor. The Confederate States declare war on Spain, and send an expeditionary force against Spanish forces in Cuba. After a successful campaign, the island is rebuilt and Cuba becomes the newest member of the Confederate States of America. Through the 20th century to the present, relations between the three countries (United States, Confederate States and Texas) are actually pretty good. <br /> <br />This is a fascinating book. History buffs,especially Civil-War history, need to read it. Some knowledge of history, more than the usual amount, would be a help. This is highly recommended. <br /> <br />	2004-11-13

He is set to lead an expedition into California's Central Valley to explore the bizarre possibility that Mayan culture may have made it that far north, before they disappeared many centuries ago. Magee is told to include Amy Parrish, another world-renowned Mayan expert, in the expedition. The museum Board is less than convinced that is is a good idea. <br /> <br />She moves into Magee's isolated house in the hills, and the two immerse themselves in Mayan culture. One night, a strange computer virus is found on Joe's laptop, where he keeps his scientific data. The computer seems to turn on by itself, and sends Joe's files to an unknown location. Sean Gables is another museum employee, who is not what he seems. Sometimes, he is legitimately helpful to Joe and Amy, and other times, he acts, well, the word \\"slimy\\" comes to mind. Strange things are going on, but neither Joe or Amy can put their finger on it. <br /> <br />Later, a dead body is found in the nearby hills, a Hispanic male with his heart cut out. For most people, this is just a particularly gruesome murder, but for Joe and Amy, it means a lot more. According to Mayan prophecy, the Fifth World is ending, and the Sixth World will be coming in a few years. It is to be preceeded by three human sacrifices. Days later, two more bodies are found with their hearts removed, right on time. Someone is putting up a very large Keep Out sign. Joe has an anonymous benefactor paying him a lot of money to find Mayan culture in those hills. The Sixth World is characterized by a shift in the earth's magnetic pole, causing worldwide catastrophe. At that time, Mayan culture will rise again, and rule the world. During a mini-expedition in the hills with some college students, Joe and Amy make some huge discoveries which prove that the rumors of Mayan culture making it as far north as central California are not just rumors. <br /> <br />This is a really good thriller story. My only criticism is that the first half of the book could have moved a little faster. Stick with the book, and this is a story that will give the reader plenty to think about. Also, keep an eye on the month of December, 2012. According to Mayan prophecy, at that time, big things are supposed to happen. <br /> <br />	2004-10-31

He realizes, early on, that education was his ticket out, so scholarships to Tulane University, then UCLA-Berkeley, lead to him becoming a civilian scientist with the Defense Department. He is called back home when Ersel, his father, is severely injured in an accident. <br /> <br />The relationship between the two can best be described as difficult. During the Great Depression, the family survived as best they could. Some money could be made by, for instance, catching crawfish or helping a neighbor in their garden, and selling to one of the local businesses. Ersel was drunk much too often. <br /> <br />At Tulane, Jickie falls for a woman named Rachel Goodman, who comes from a very religious family. Her brother, David, the man of the family (their father had died), tells Jickie to end the relationship, now, because he isn't Jewish. David even takes Rachel home to Texas, to prevent them from seeing each other. Jickie marries a local girl, but she later dies of cancer. In the early 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement comes to town, in the form of three young people helping the local blacks to register and vote. An attampt by the local Ku Klux Klan to encourage the three to immediately leave turns tragic. <br /> <br />Back to the present, actually the late 1970s, Jickie's bitterness and jadedness comes off as acting like a major jerk. When Ersel wakes up, there is no grand, tearful reunion (the two hadn't spoken to each other in more than 15 years). In fact, they spend most of their time complaining at each other. On the good side, Jickie runs into Rachel, now Ersel's neurosurgeon, and they get back together. As time goes on, the two men spend a lot of time with each other, get a lot of things out in the open, and Jickie begins to start to let go of his pain and bitterness. <br /> <br />The reading may seem rather slow, but, by the end, the reader will realize that they have just finished a greatnovel. Not only is this an interesting story of a person's life, but one can almost hear and smell the bayou while reading it. This is a fine piece of writing. <br /> <br />	2004-10-31

He is involved in two major arrest operations, one involving drug running in Mexico, and the other involving drug and people smuggling in Seattle. Both are solid arrests, the kind where convictions are practically guaranteed. That is, until both suspects are released, and granted immunity from prosecution by someone very high in the CIA. Supposedly, they are also good sources of information for the Agency. Blake knows that something very strange is happening. <br /> <br />Blake was born in a Japanese concentration camp in World War II Hong Kong. His parents, a Welsh father and a Hispanic mother, did not survive the war. Blake was adopted by Wang Chan, a rising member of the Hong Kong business community. Soon before the arrests mentioned above, Wang Chan is found murdered. Like most Hong Kong businessmen, there are rumors that he was involved in illegal activities. Unsatisfied with the pace of the official investigation, Chan's son, Raymond, goes to the Hong Kong triads (gangsters) and asks for their help in avenging his father's death. <br /> <br />While all this is going on, Blake gets word of a proposed alliance between one of the triads and a Mexican drug cartel, assisted by whomever in the CIA is in the habit of releasing drug dealers from prison. Profits are down, so it is proposed that they get together and market an ancient, and quite powerful, Mayan drug called jfuri. Just to make things more interesting, Blake has fallen in love with DEA Special Prosecutor Angela Townsend. It is up to Blake to fight his way through the conspiracies, corruption and general lying to get to the bottom of this, once and for all. <br /> <br />This is an excellent novel. Thriller readers will love it. The reader will be involved from start to finish, it feels very plausible, and the author knows what he is talking about, having actually been born in a World War II concentration camp in Hong Kong. This gets two thumbs up. <br /> <br />	2004-10-20

Instead of, for instance, taking a bus trip to the Statue of Liberty, why not take a trip to the bookstores in Greenwich Village? <br /> <br />The book looks at the present situation for the independent bookstore. The news is not very good. While some store are able to survive, even thrive, more stores are closing every day. There are a number of reasons, including the coming of the chains, the economy, skyrocketing rents and the internet. Another problem is the sheer number of new books published, reaching 175,000 in 2003 from over 78,000 publishers. <br /> <br />What can indie bookstores do to survive? First and foremost, customer service is everything. Selling used books creates more profit than new books. Get creative with entertainment and special events. Consider a makeover of the decor to find that balance between fun and functional. Including a cafe encourages customers to linger and buy more books. Get involved in the community. Perhaps shrinking the store is the way to go. Cross promote with neighboring businesses. <br /> <br />The book also explores the mechanics of setting up a bookstore tour. Included are things like making sure that the destination stores are still there, anyone can plan a bookstore trip, handling reservations, the best day to go, the best kind of transportation, seeing if the destination stores will hold special events during your trip, where to eat, things to do while in transit, publicizing the trip and dealing with the bus company, among many others. <br /> <br />Bookstore tourism is a wonderful idea (anything that helps independent bookstores is a wonderful idea) and this is an excellent book that ended much too soon. I really enjoying reading it. The author mentions that more books on independent bookstores are planned in the future. I can't wait. <br/> <br />	2004-10-15

This book, written by an 11-year veteran of the NYPD, looks at real police procedures in the Big Apple. <br /> <br />It gives the street addresses, coverage areas and major landmarks for all the precincts in the five boroughs. It describes the various units and other personnel within a precinct, like the Integrity Control Officer, the Anti-Crime Unit, the Borough Task Force, the Emergency Services Unit, the Squad Commander, the Hate Crimes Task Force, and the Organized Crime Control Bureau, among many others. There is now no reason for a writer to put a precinct in the wrong part of the city, or to have a crime investigated by the wrong part of the precinct. <br /> <br />The author then explores what really happens at the scene of a homicide. Rigor mortis is part of practically every murder novel, but is usually done incorrectly. It does not turn a body permanently rigid; after about a day and a half, the body returns to totally flaccid. A reliable way for the medical examiner to determine the time of death is to check the contents of the stomach during the autopsy. <br /> <br />The first patrol officer on the scene will often make or break the case. He or she will establish the crime scene without contaminating it, and detain witnesses and suspects. Everything starts with a clear and accurate description, whether it's of a lost child or a murder suspect. <br /> <br />Other chapters look at police lineups, what the Miranda Warning is all about, courtroom testimony (including how to survive cross-examination), the various types of serial killers, and sex crimes and child abuse cases. There is also a handy glossary of actual police lingo and a list of police acronyms. <br /> <br />This is a very complete book. For writers of crime novels, especially NYPD novels, this book belongs on your reference shelf. For everyone else, read this book and seefor yourself just how well, or how badly, TV does the police business. Highly recommended. <br /> <br />	2004-10-15

What could be in it to cause such a warning? According to this book, it's the fluoride. <br /> <br />Fluoride is not some safe, innocuous substance that happens to fight cavities. It is used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons, to prepare Sarin nerve gas, to produce high octane gasoline, also to make refrigerant gases and Teflon plastic. It is also used in drugs like Prozac and Cipro. Fluoride is a potential workplace poison and grave environmental hazard. <br /> <br />Since the 1930s, fluoride has been linked, in Europe, to a number of illnesses, like central nervous system disorders, breathing problems and a number of arthritis-like ailments. But during the Cold War, with help from researchers funded by the government and industry, no such problems were reported in America. It is as if \\"American\\" fluoride and \\"European\\" fluoride have two different sets of properties. Can anyone say \\"scientific fraud?\\"  <br /> <br />Fluoride may actually help the teeth, but the evidence is not clear-cut. Cavity rates have fallen dramatically since the 1940s, but also in countries that don't fluoridate their water. Perhaps good nutrition, better dental care and antibiotics can explain it. <br /> <br />The vast majority, nearly 90 percent, of the fluoride added to drinking water is actually industrial waste, scraped from the smokestacks of Florida phosphate fertilizer mills. The companies are spared the expense of treating this \\"fluosilicic acid\\" as toxic waste. Instead, it is sold to towns all over America. Shipped in rubber-lined tanker trucks, it is dumped into municipal reserviors, supposedly to fight cavities. <br /> <br />On several levels, this book easily reaches the level of Wow. This well-written tale of public relations whitewash and corporate/government collusion at the people's expense has over 100 pages of footnotes, and is very much a Must Read. <br /> <br />	2004-10-10

The comparisons are distressingly close. <br /> <br />Massachusetts of the 1690s was a very rigid sort of place. Those in power were ideologues who believed that their version of Calvinism was the only way and the only truth. Everyone who came to Massachusetts was required by law to attend Puritan services. Belonging to any other church was forbidden, on pain of banishment or hanging. All dissent was equated to bonding with the devil. The Puritans believed you were \\"either with us or against us.\\" Since Massachusetts thought itself a place where anyone could find work, poverty was considered a sign of general immorality and probable damnation. <br /> <br />America in 2004 is a place where those on the bottom are blamed instead of helped. Prisons are full of victims of poverty, and each year scores of Americans are legally executed. It stems from a point of view of self-seeking masquerading as righteousness, without regard for social justice. Selfishness is a virtue. Those who can't make it economically are wicked and contemptible. Today's leaders are as inhumane and self-righteous as those of 300 years ago. <br /> <br />Paul Wolfowitz and Minister Cotton Mather tried to emulate their famous fathers. They both also see only what they want to see, and are slippery and self-serving in argument. Deputy Governor William Stoughton and Donald Rumsfeld both hold rigid ideological views, lack humanity and mercy, and are war mongers and hypocrites. Stoughton and Dick Cheney are willing to bend their view of the world to accommodate their pursuit of wealth and power. Magistrate John Hathorne and Richard perle were not part of their respective elites, but they were the first to push their respective agendas. Governor William Phips and George Bush were intellectually lacking, but they did have a talent for forming alliances and cultivating people. They also had very foul mouths and furious tempers, and owed everything to family connections. <br /> <br />It's disheartening to know that Americans have evolved so little in 300 years. This is quite an eye-opener of a book. An interest in Massachusetts of the 1690s would be a big help, but this is still fascinating and thought-provoking. Highly recommended. <br />	2004-10-07

The House was exiled to the mainland several hundred years previously when it took sides against another human House who had attacked a race of dwarves called the Telmet. Andalarn is not the hero type, being a merchant with five children. With help from an elven healer named Baliak, he appeals to the Telmet for help in restoring House Thran to its former position. <br /> <br />Standing in Thran's way are House Suum, a military House who makes no secret of their desire to wipe out House Thran, once and for all, and the priestly caste called the Tialsar who play the Houses against one another for their own advantage. The referee between the Houses is the Council of Mages in the city of Moorkai, the actual seat of power on Adylonis. <br /> <br />No House has the power to become Ascendant on its own, so the choice of the Council will have plenty of authority on the island. Underlying all of this are rumors and uneasiness about a legendary being called the Great Diur, whose return would mean the end of everything on the island. Many believe that anything, even death, is better than the Great Diur's return. <br /> <br />Fans of Robert E. Howard will love this book, for his influence is all over it. For everyone else, it's a really good dark fantasy story (the first of a series) with good characters, elves and dwarves, a bit of blood, ancient forces best left alone; in short, it's got everything a reader needs. Keep an eye on this series; it's worth reading. <br />	2004-09-18

For most of his life, he has been plagued by prophetic dreams and \\"hunches,\\" one of which saved his life.

Also gone is an Indian artifact of great power called the Manitou Stone.  <br /> <br />These are hard times for the local Indian tribes. The buffalo, on which they depend, are almost gone. A Cree sorcerer, Wandering Spirit, plans to use the power of the Stone to bring about the long-prophecied Day of Changes, when the natives of western Canada will reclaim their stolen lands. Also included in this story are underground tunnels where time and distance work very differently than aboveground, and the spirit of a white buffalo forced into the body of a newborn child too early. <br /> <br />This novel is really good. Much of it is based on actual history. It's just weird enough to be interesting, the characters are real people, and it's very well done. It is well worth reading. <br />	2004-09-11

Merritt meets Philip Dick	First published in 1938, this is the story of Jan Palmer, a shy, bookish young man who heads a steamship company inherited from his late father. He has no interest in the company, and would dearly love to get rid of it. One night, Professor Frobish visits and pleads with Jan for a chance to open, and analyze, the contents of a sealed copper jar in Jan's possession. It's said to contain the remains of a member of an ancient race called the jinn. Palmer promised an old friend a long time ago, that the jar would never be opened, and he intends to keep that promise. <br /> <br />Later that night, Frobish returns, now obsessed with the copper jar. The two men fight over it, and the jar is opened. A very large being, with shaggy hair and tusks, named Zongri appears in the room. Having been imprisoned since the time of Sulayman the Magnificent, Zongri decided long ago that whoever released him would receive instant death. Before Frobish can escape, Zongri grabs a nearby sword and chops him nearly in half. Instead of killing Jan, Zongri curses him with eternal wakefulness. Right after Jan finds himself alone in the room, the police burst in and haul him off to jail. Jan sticks to his innocence. The best his lawyer can do is maybe get him a one-way trip to a mental hospital. When he lays down to sleep, he suddenly finds himself on a sailing ship in the middle of nowhere, and he is strong and muscular. <br /> <br />He knows that his name is Tiger, and while he may look like a bodybuilder, he is still shy, bookish Jan Palmer on the inside. He is in a world of sorcery and pirates, kind of like a Robert E. Howard novel. He sees people that he knows from \\"his\\"world, but they don't know him. Jan (as Tiger) finds some astronomical instruments, and discovers that he has not, as he thought, traveled into the past. The date is the same in both worlds. When he lays down to sleep, Tiger finds himself back in the jail cell, as Jan.

Several hundred years previously, all the women from Earth packed up and moved to Coney Island, leaving the men on their own. Now, the only contact between them happens once a year in a neutral part of the galaxy. At that meeting, all male babies born on Coney Island are exchanged for a ton of frozen sperm. <br /> <br />For the past 50 years or so, secret contacts have been taking place between both planets concerning Reunification, a very touchy subject for both sides. The leaders of Coney Island need to know what's happening on Earth. All their probes and long-distance readings can't get past the Dispro Haze. It's a mile-high layer of dust, chemicals and debris that surrounds Earth and blocks out the sun; giant xenon lamps are used to simulate the sun. Tritch is chosen as a one-person mission to Earth, but specialized training is needed, first. At the local military academy, she meets Bangut Walht, a sensitive young man (it's the only place on Coney Island where men are allowed), to which Tritch is immediately attracted. She also meets Slab Ricknoy, a loudmouthed, arrogant jerk. The program ends, and the men are sent back to Earth, the day that Hash and Ricknoy get into a fight. <br /> <br />Tritch arrives on Earth, near Lake Michigan, and her cover is blown almost immediately. Earth is a place of extreme dirtiness. The air is dirty, the people are dirty and much of the planet is either full of radiation, or officially dead. She runs into Bangut Walht, who shows her the few bright spots. She also meets Slab Ricknoy, now a General, who is convinced that Hash is there to spy on him. He is also a paranoid person, who believes in endless war. Ricknoy has also impounded Hash's ship, looking for its faster-than-light drive, called a lighterator. By galactic law, Earth is confined to the solar system. Should people like Ricknoy get an FTL drive, it would not bode well for anyone, especially the inhabitants of Coney Island. <br /> <br />This is a really sharp satire about men and women about which I'm sure some people will complain. I enjoyed it. It's very easy to read, it has things to say, and it's quite a perceptive story. Well worth checking out. <br /> <br />	2004-08-13

That wealth has been given to the top 1 percent of the people, in terms of income, by a group of elites and super-rich that the author calls the Bush Gang. The Bush family has been at, or near, the seat of American power for 16 of the last 24 years. <br /> <br />To give one example, from 1982 to 2002, the number of Americans without health care jumped from 25 million to 43 million, a rise of more than 50 percent. In that same period, the number of American billionaires rose from 13 to 229. <br /> <br />The Bush Gang's plan looks something like this: Give tax relief to corporations and the very rich. Build up the military with big increases in defense spending. Be very aggressive in international relations. Deregulate business as much as possible. Overlook the criminal actions of those businessmen who support this agenda. Ignore the real possibility of large deficits. Also, attack labor and working Americans as much as possible. <br /> <br />This book covers a number of topics. The Bush remedy for a sick economy is CEOs who will drive up a company's stock price by laying off thousands of workers. There has been a systematic plan to keep wages low for most Americans in order to transfer wealth to the richest. The famous Skull and Bones club at Yale was originally endowed in the 1830s by the Russell Trust. It was connected to a company that, at the time, was the premier American smuggler of opium. The media, especially Rupert Murdoch and Fox News, can be counted on to keep up the fear level. One of the justifications for tax cuts is that the money will be used for new investment. Has that happened over the last 25 years? <br /> <br />What is to be done? The Democratic Party needs to get a backbone. It should not blame Ralph Nader for the results of the 2000 election, but itself. It needs to push itsvision for America: higher minimum wage, federally funded health care for all, full employment, public works spending that fixes America's infrastructure, good public schools, etc. <br /> <br />This is a gem of a book. Can't get ahead financially? This book gives part of the reason. It's highly recommended.	2004-08-10

The US Senate overwhelmingly passed sanctions against Iraq in response. The sanctions were squelched by the Reagan and Bush I Administrations, because Saddam Hussein was an ally and there was money to be made for US corporations in Iraq. <br /> <br />The New York Times made a great show of regret, corrections and mea culpas after reporter Jayson Blair was exposed as having falsified several stories. No such official behavior occurred after reporter Judith Miller was found to have relied on fraudulent intelligence from the Iraqi National Congress in several front page stories. <br /> <br />Citing a desire to protect the American people from seeing unpleasant images on TV, one would have to look very hard to find ANY picture of dead or dying Iraqis, or anguished relatives in hospitals, on American TV. A much more accurate reason for such a decision is to control what Americans see of the war. It's \\"supposed\\" to be a clean, videogame sort of war, full of extremely accurate US weapons, not a place where innocent civilians die in all sorts of brutal and graphic ways. <br /> <br />In a provision of the No Child Left Behind Act (the sweeping education reform bill), secondary schools are required to give military recruiters access to facilities, along with contact information for all students. The penalty for not doing so is a cutoff of federal aid. There is an opt-out provision for schools. When one school in New York made use of it, only 43 out of 1,200 students let their names be sent to military recruiters. <br /> <br />This book also covers a myriad of other subjects, from the USA PATRIOT Act to war profiteering, to what happens to those who don't support the war, to Mumia Abu-Jamal, to East Timor,to US Army psyops used against Americans, among others. It is better than excellent. It is full of things that will never be covered in the mainstream media. To educate yourself on what America is really like, this is a fine place to start. It is highly recommended. <br />	2004-08-08

It now ranges from conservative think tanks, like the Heritage Foundation, to K Street lobbying firms, to right wing media (especially talk radio). Starting from the grass roots, Republicans have become very good at getting their message to the public. The weekly Republican &quot;must attend&quot; meeting in Washington is run by tax opponent Grover Norquist. It is there that the message of the week is chosen. Democrats are nowhere near as organized. <br />  <br /> Even inside the Republican Party, moderation and disagreement are squelched, and traditional oversight agencies are stripped of their influence. The National Cancer Institute's website was altered to say that abortion increases a woman's chance of getting breast cancer, even though actual research overwhelmingly shows the opposite. The CDC's website has been altered, in that information showing that condom use is effective in preventing AIDS has been removed. This is in line with the Christian Right's opposition to sex education. <br />  <br /> Woe unto that person or group who uses their constitutional right to oppose the war in Iraq. Tennessee State Senator Tim Burchett has advocated the deportation of war critics. Who can forget the experiences of the Dixie Chicks? A number of recently published books equate liberals with hating America, and generally betraying the nation. Ann Coulter has called Democrats the Treason Party. It has now become popular among Republicans to label any dissenter, whether environmentalist or senior citizen, as a terrorist. <br />  <br /> This is an excellent book from Rampton and Stauber. The brains behind PR Watch, they have created another Must Read look at how the US Government really works. This is highly recommended.  <br />	2004-08-05

Through the early 20th century, there were a number of open-air forums open to all. The most famous was a place called Bughouse Square. Kind of like Hyde Park in London, anyone could get on a soapbox and talk on anything. The International Workers of the World (IWW, or Wobblies) were the first egalitarian union, open to everyone, especially the supposedly &quot;unorganizable&quot; immigrant workers. Perhaps the most well-known watering hole was a place called the Dil Pickle Club. To read literature unavailable elsewhere, there werea number of radical bookstores around the city, assisted by the Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company (publisher of this book). One of the major links between the 1920s counterculture and the 1960s Beat Generation/New Left counterculture was a place called the College of Complexes. <br />  <br /> Run by a man named Slim Brundage, the College was a very egalitarian sort of place. Any night of the week, anyone could attend a lecture on any topic under the sun; sometimes serious, sometimes frivolous. It wasn't a place where only &quot;educated&quot; people could give lectures (though a number of college professors did just that); even the lowliest person could stand and challenge the lecturer or give a lecture themselves. One of the College's central principles was that just because a person had a blue-collar job, or no job, did not mean that they did not care about intellectual matters, or that they couldn't talk on any given subject. <br />  <br /> Other nights, the College played host to art exhibitions, live music, theater, etc. The walls were lined with chalkboards for anyone to use. It was one of the few places in 1950s Chicago to accept blacks and women. It didn't discourage right-wingers from coming, but it's general point of view was more left-wing and Marxist/Leninist. In the latter 1950s, when the beatnik movement was suffering a backlash throughout much of America, the College was one of the few places to say Beatniks Are Welcome. It lasted from 1951 to 1961, when Brundage was forced to close by the IRS, the official reason being nonpayment of entertainment taxes. Throughout that time, the College of Complexes never forgot the meaning of the word &quot;fun&quot;. <br />  <br /> I really enjoyed this book. Anyone interested in 20th century anti-establishment/free speech/beatnik history in America will also enjoy it. It's well worth the reader's time. <br />  <br />	2004-08-04
US	50455329	R23QX2D7I75H7F	1583224904	788245572	Terrorism: Theirs and Ours	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A look at the background behind terrorism	From the perspective of someone from South Asia (Ahamd was from Pakistan), this book looks deeper at this thing called terrorism. <br />  <br /> There are several aspects to the official approach to terrorism. First, terrorists change. Yesterday's terrorist is today's freedom fighter, and vice versa. Second, there seems to be no such thing as an &quot;official&quot; definition of terrorism. Explanations are designed to arouse our emotions, instead of stimulating our intelligence. Third, government officials may not be able to define terrorism, but they know that it must be stamped out worldwide.  <br />  <br /> Fourth, it's supposedly possible to tell the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter. Fifth, the official approach ignores the causes of terrorism. Cause? What cause? Sixth, the moral revulsion against terrorism needs to be selective. Terror from disapproved groups needs to be strongly condemned, but terror from allies or approved groups can be ignored. <br />  <br /> Why do groups commit terrorist acts? Getting their grievances heard through regular channels hasn't worked, so, to them, terrorism is the only way to be heard. Terrorism is an expression of anger and helplessness, and also a sense of betrayal. Through the spread of modern technology and communications, terror has become globalized. Everyone is a target. <br />  <br /> The author recommends several approaches for America. Stop with the double standards. Don't condone some terrorism, and condemn others. In the present situation, such an approach will not work. Also, America should actually consider the causes of terrorism. It's a political problem; seek a political solution. The author also recommends reinforcing the framework of international law. Try going through the International Court of Justice. <br />  <br /> This is an excellent book. It's short, and written from a non-American perspective. It does a fine job looking at the background behind terrorism, and it's well worth reading.  <br />	2004-08-04

The author feels that America is inside a 3000-mile wide terrarium, cut off from the rest of the world. This would explain that by the time of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, the difference in world view between America and the rest of the world grew to the size of the hole in the ozone layer over the South Pole.<br />During the Nazi era, the Big Lie was simple and repeated over and over again until it became the equivalent of inescapable sound. For whatever reason, George Bush was not a good liar. He and his advisers made the mistake of elaborating, retracting and adding on to the reasons for attacking Iraq. The rest of the world must have been laughing when the Bush Administration came up with one more reason for invasion. The American people believed them, as they generally do when their government and television tell them something. Another rule to keeping things simple is to not offer any evidence, so there can be no refutation. The supposed warehouses full of evidence turned out to be nothing.<br />Ever since the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock, America has believed that it is a \\"city on a hill,\\" a feeling of \\"we are right and you are wrong.\\" Since Providence has chosen America to work through human history, anyone already occupying the continent could justifiably be removed or killed.<br />The first lines of the National Anthem contain the roots of flagolatry, or excessive reverence for the national symbol. Democracies are always right, America is a democracy, so America is always right. Since America is the best democracy, it is more right than the others. Inside the terrarium called America, Arabs don't exist and nobody has heard of them. Arabs are considered non-people with a non-claim to nothing. Americans go on and on about being the greatest country in the world with an almost neurotic need for praise from outside the biosphere. Americans also have rabbit ears for criticism from outside, but the voice of reason just bounces off the glass.<br />This is a Wow of a book. I'm not sure if I have ever read a book quite like this. It's rare when an American can look at this country the way foreigners (probably) do. It is very highly recommended.	2004-07-03

In Syria, the CIA sponsored a 1949 military takeover, the first of over a dozen coups in the next 20 years. American oil companies felt that an independent Syria was not in their interests. Sudan has been involved, off and on, in a bloody civil war for almost 50 years. Oil just happens to be a factor in this ongoing slaughter.<br />In Egypt, Hosni Mubarak has ruled with an iron fist ever since the 1982 assassination of Anwar Sadat, his predecessor. Mubarak uses billions of dollars in US military aid to beat and torture opposition politicians and journalists, many of whom have died in custody. Press restrictions are widespread. Egypt is viewed as a well-bribed client state of the US. The military in Turkey, a US ally and fellow member of NATO, has been one of the biggest human rights abusers of the last decade.<br />America has always looked for a surrogate policeman in the Persian Gulf, to keep an eye on the huge oil reserves. First, we armed the Shah of Iran, ignoring his repression, until he was overthrown. Then we armed Iraq, ignoring Saddam Hussein's repression, until he became too powerful, and a major war was needed to destroy his arsenal. Now, America is arming Saudi Arabia, ignoring their repression, creating a generation of militants determined to overthrow the puppet regime propped up with American money.<br />Part of the blame for all this can be laid at the feet of Great Britain. They were the colonial power for much of the first half of the 20th century, and had a tendency to draw national boundaries while ignoring an area's ethnic makeup.<br />Arab hatred of America has less to do with our freedoms and diversity than with our illegal involvement in another country's internal affairs. This book easily reaches the level of Must Read. It's very interesting, it's easy to read and it is full of information that won't be mentioned in the mainstream media.	2004-04-02

He is also obnoxious, controlling, manipulative and willing to walk over anyone to get what he wants. In short, he is a thoroughly dislikable person, the sort of person who deserves to die in the early part of the novel.<br />One day, his boss sends him to New Mexico to do some pro bono advertising work for a group of Navajo indians. When he arrives, a couple of other Native Americans, who have no liking for white men, put him in their truck and head for the mountains. Lew quickly realizes that something is wrong; the thought of being murdered and dumped somewhere desolate crosses his mind more than once. They end up in a place that isn't just in the middle of Nowhere, it's many miles from Nowhere. To make a long story short, Lew is forced to undergo a Native American vision quest.<br />The thought of walking back to civilization is out of the question, so Lew is stuck. He spends the next several days thinking about his life, and doing battle with various personal demons. There are a few periods of altered consciousness. Slowly, Lew begins o realize what a mean, inconsiderate person he has become and doesn't like what he sees. When he ends the quest, and is returned to civilization by the same people who put him there, he is immediately arrested on a murder charge.<br />Another Native American was found dead in the vicinity of Lew's vision quest. Maybe Lew killed him during one of his periods of altered consciousness. Gary, a lawyer and one of the few people who can tolerate Lew's moods, gets Lew cleared. Lew doesn't know that Gary knows that Gary's wife, Lynne, has cheated on him a number of times, including with Lew.<br />When Lew tries to show the people he knows that he has changed, he is met with universal scorn and disbelief. It gets worse when he tries to express his sincere sympathy for Gary's suicide. Among those who don't believe Lew are his ex-wife and young son, who he has disappointed many times in the past. Slowly, very slowly, attitudes toward Lew begin to change. He stays in the Southwest, with a couple of advertising clients of his own, but focusing only on honorable clients. He gets involved in teaching Native American spirituality to others.<br />This is well worth reading. Not only is it a very good Native American story, it also shows how even the most incorrigible person can change. Two thumbs up.	2003-12-30

After spending a year in military prison, during which time he became estranged from his family, he travels around Europe, not really sure where he's going or what he's doing. In Paris, he meets a man named Hasan, who encourages David to accompany him back to Iran, his homeland. David is assured that plenty of jobs for foreigners are available. Their paths diverge for a while, and they meet up again a few weeks later, and undertake a harrowing journey to Iran by way of southeast Europe and Turkey.<br />The mountains of southeast Turkey are full of the sort of people who shoot first and don't bother with asking questions later. The two pass many disabled vehicles along the way, but don't even think of stopping; the philosophy is &quot;every man for himself.&quot; They eventually reach Teheran, the Iranian capital. It's a dirty, noisy, congested place, like a city that's grown up too quickly. They continue to Mashad, Hasan's hometown, a much cleaner and nicer place.<br />David is invited to a meeting of an informal group of young people to discuss political philosophy; they have heard about his political rebellion. It's during the reign of the Shah, whose secret police, the SAVAK, are everywhere, so many precautions are needed. A few days later, the leaders of the group are arrested, and David is told to leave Iran immediately. He continues on to Afghanistan.<br />While there, he meets some Westerners who are more interested in drugs than in getting a different perspective of the world around them. He is told that he must continue on to India, to experience it first hand. Emotionally, it will hit him harder than anything in his life, but it's something he must do. Throughout his whole trip, and expecially in India, he experiences great kindness from total strangers. He also witnesses poverty and misery on a scale inconceivable to the average American.<br />This book is short, but it works on several levels. It's a good travel story, it's a good political and personal philosophy story, and it's a fine tale of an average person looking for his place in the world. It's well worth reading.	2003-12-30

Two days later, she accepts his marriage proposal.<br />She knows absolutely nothing about Ben, including what country he is from, Morocco or Monaco. Now that Ben is back home in Morocco (he lives with his parents), he has become very religious and distant toward Emily. His father, Alhab, really doesn't like Emily, because she is not a proper Muslim woman, but Emily and Sharina, Alhab's wife, take an instant liking to each other.<br />Ben goes off every morning, leaving Emily by herself, and frequently doesn't come back until late at night. He tells her he is having a new house built for them in a nearby town, but refuses to tell her anything else. Emily makes a few friends on her own, including the wife of the Spanish Amabssador. One day, Emily decides to pay an unannounced visit to the family shop in the local bazaar. She finds Alhab in the back room, making love to an American woman, and talking to her like she is his wife. Emily is properly veiled, so Alhab doesn't know that it is her. She practically runs out of the shop, and back to the house.<br />Later, on a trip to look for this new house, about which Emily still knows nothing, Emily meets a woman named Animora, who says she is the wife of Ben Saidouili. Animora's house is also where Emily gives birth to Ben's son. After she recovers, divorce and taking her son back to Texas, is looking very tempting for Emily.<br />Finally, the house is finished, and Emily and Ben move in. The word &quot;mansion&quot; comes to mind; it's made with the best of everything. Emily's attitude toward Ben softens, and she decides to stay. Her parents show up for a surprise visit and bring along a part of Emily's past that she would rather keep hidden, and present Emily and Ben with a honeymoon in Paris.<br />Written in the form of diary excerpts,this is a really good story about the power of love to transcend even religious boundaries. This tale of modern culture clash is very much worth reading.	2003-12-23

Rankin does whatever he can to get his clients acquitted, usually by painting them as political victims or by playing the race card. One night, sitting in a bar, Goren hears, and is very glad that, Rankin has died of a heart attack. An older black woman sitting next to him asks Goren to take back his words about Rankin. He refuses, not knowing that the woman is a voodoo priestess. The next morning, Goren finds that Rankin has been resurrected from the dead...as his, shall we say, male sex organ.<br />One can imagine the problems this can cause. The two come to an agreement, where Rankin stays quiet during the day, while Goren is at work. Rankin knows the priestess who did this, but refuses to take Goren to her until he gets a chance to properly say goodbye to his family. Meantime, Goren has several sexual opportunities with other women. When Rankin cooperates, the sex for her is mindblowing. Later, the two have a test of wills. When Rankin doesn't cooperate, the results are disastrous.<br />Rankin and Goren show Rankin's widow, Jane, everything, and the two have a final farewell of their own, with Goren in the background. Anne, Rankin's estranged daughter from his first marriage, eventually agrees to see Goren. She happens to be gorgeous, and Goren falls head over heels in love with her. But Rankin refuses to, in effect, have sex with his own daughter. Eventually, Rankin makes his peace with Anne (by tape recording) and takes Goren to the voodoo priestess to get the curse undone.<br />Get past the bizarre central premise, and this is quite a book. It's easy to read, and it's got something to say, including about liberal politics and the American justice system. For those who are not squeamish about sex and talking body parts, this is recommended.	2003-11-25

The Ig Nobel Awards (actually held every year at Harvard University) honor those achievements which &quot;cannot or should not be reproduced.&quot;<br />Did you know that elevator music may help prevent the common cold? Companies like Enron, Global Crossing, Tyco, Waste Management and WorldCom shared an award for adapting the mathematical concept of imaginary numbers for use in the business world. A man from Lithuania created an amusement park called Stalin World. To save money, the British Royal Navy has barred trainees at its top gunnery school from firing live shells and ordered them to shout &quot;bang.&quot; It has been determined that, biochemically, romantic love may be indistinguishable from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. A college professor from Pennsylvania fed prozac to clams (at the cellular level, clams and humans show remarkable nervous system similarities), resulting in a whole lot of reproducing going on. A man from France is the only winner of two Ig Nobels, for demonstrating that water has a memory, and that the information can be transmitted over the phone and the Internet.<br />Then there are the &quot;classics,&quot; like the scientific investigation of why toast often falls on the buttered side; an Australian man who patented the wheel, and the Australian Patent Office who granted it; a man from Arizona who invented software that detcts when a cat is walking across your keyboard; the Southern Baptist Church of Alabama for their county-by-county estimate of how many Alabama citizens will go to hell if they don't repent; the sociology of Canadian donut shops, and the optimal way to dunk a biscuit. Last but not least, a solution has been found to the age-old problem of how to quickly start a barbecue. It can be done in less than four seconds with charcoal - and liquid oxygen.<br />This book is hilarious. It's humor of a slightly more highbrow variety, designed to make people laugh, then think. It's highly recommended for everyone, even those who think that they hate science.	2003-09-26

What if you are not cut out for computers or the financial sector? Start with something about which you are passionate, and brainstorm from there. A boring job, no matter how lucrative, is not worth it.<br />Everyone wants to find their ideal job immediately. Life doesn't work that way; it's supposed to be a learning experience. Every job, no matter how boring, is just one step closer to that ideal position. Employers are more interested in real enthusiasm (passion) for a job or demonstrated abilities in, for instance, problem solving and logical thinking, than in a degree in a certain field.<br />When faced with an unsuccessful job interview, some people consider it no big deal and go on to the next one, while others get very depressed and upset with themselves. The difference is called Perspective. Try cutting a huge task into smaller pieces, and be sure to reward yourself when you accomplish those smaller tasks.<br />Why is it that, in a friendship, we can accept the other person, warts and all, and give without thinking about it, but in a relationship, much more attention is given to how much each person is giving or taking? Ignore the drumbeat of society which says that a person &quot;should&quot; be married or in a long term relationship by a certain age. Your time may come earlier or later in life. When it comes, you'll know.<br />If the relationship with the parents was difficult (in any sense of the term), consider forgiveness. The intention isn't so much to let them off the hook, as to let yourself off the hook. That way, you can get past whatever emotional hold they had on you, and get on with your life.<br />This book is a keeper. It's recommended not just for college graduates (all of whom should read it), but for people who have been out of college for awhile. It's got a lot of insight that's good for all ages. It's really worth it.	2003-09-18

This short book, composed of previously published articles from CovertAction magazine, shows that America has the world's biggest stocks of such weapons, and has used them many times in the past.<br />America is a signatory to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, but the first Bush Administration refused to go along with the 1997 protocol on verification of compliance. While other countries with CBW capability were expected, by the US, to allow foreign inspectors access to their facilities, the US refused to grant such access. The fear was that legitimate commercial and military secrets would be exposed.<br />officially, there has been a worldwide ban, since 1969, on the development of chemical and biological weapons. A loophole demanded by America allows for research on \\"defensive\\" bioweapons. There is a tiny difference between \\"defensive\\" and \\"offensive\\" bioweapons research.<br />Over the years, the US military has tested CBW techniques on American citizens a number of times. In 1950, a cloud of bacteria was sprayed over San Francisco by the US Navy, resulting in many cases of pneumonia-like symptoms. In 1955, the Tampa Bay, Florida area experienced a huge rise in cases of whooping cough after a still-secret CIA biowar test. In 1932, the US Public Health Service started a study of untreated syphilis using 400 poor black men (who were never told of their sickness) in Tuskegee, Alabama. Another US policy has been the forced sterilization of women in the Third World. The purpose has been to protect US business interests from the threat of revolutions brought about by chronic unemployment.<br />After the \\"ban\\" on CBW research, many researchers simply continued their work under the guise of fighting cancer. Also covered in this book is the story of a widespread epidemic in Cuba in 1981 introduced by theUS. Thousands of veterans returned from Vietnam and Iraq with the growing degenerative effects inside them of Agent Orange and depleted uranium. They have spent years fighting the US Government for any recognition or recompense for their illnesses.<br />My only criticism of this book is that the articles reprinted here were first published between 1982 and 1993. The editors couldn't have found anything more recent? This is a short book, but it says a lot. It's interesting, easy to read, more than a little sickening and shows what the US Government really does with taxpayer money. It's recommended.	2003-08-28

He had writing in his blood, and figured L.A. was the place to go. While amassing rejection slips, he worked a variety of jobs, including furniture moving, painting apartments, TV repos and delivering phone books door-to-door.<br />Much of the book concerns his experiences behind the wheel of a taxi. Some of those he meets are decent, reasonable people; others can be described in terms much less complimentary. One day, an older woman gets into his cab and says that she is Maria Callas, the international opera star. The only problem is that Maria Callas died several months previously. When apprised of the fact, \\"Ms. Callas\\" gets very angry and belligerent and refuses to pay her fare. She is taken away by the police.<br />Later in the book, Alex sells his cab and goes in with some friends on the making of a horror film to break into the video market. Called Bloodsucking Geeks (written by Alex), the budget can best be described as tiny. All of the video distributors are either not interested, or they want total control on a vague promise of future payment. After several months, with no job and no money to buy a cab and return to the streets, Alex finds himself experiencing involuntary dieting (also called starvation).<br />City of Angels? Maybe for that couple of percent of people who get anywhere near that thing called \\"fame and fortune.\\" Everyone else is just trying to get by in a place where, if you don't have the right job and a flashy car, the odds are very much stacked against you.<br />This book is excellent. It's full of honest, heartfelt writing that certainly shows a very different view of Hollywood. It's also highly recommended.	2003-08-28

Not any more	Many books have been written over the years attempting to tell people how to improve their lives. They usually involve living on a certain amount of money per week or month. This book was first published in 1908, and was a major bestseller. It could be considered the first self-help book, and it takes a different approach, looking at time instead of money.<br />Time is a very funny thing; everyone gets the same amount per day. Rich people do not get more than poor people. It's not possible to go the store and buy time. Out of that 24 hours per day, everyone must carve out a life (marriage, family, work, hobbies, religion, etc).<br />This book was written in a time and place (England of the early 1900s) where everyone took the train to work. One of the author's suggestions is to use that time concentrating on one thing; it doesn't matter what it is. If your mind starts wandering, hook a leash to it and bring it back. I'm not sure how well this would work today, when everyone drives to work. You say you can't concentrate for very long? Having to give a big presentation at work, or final exams in school, does a wonderful job of focusing the mind.<br />Then comes the evening, after the reader has gotten home from work. If this book had been written today, the author might say that occasionally vegging out in front of the TV is not a bad thing, but don't be like the average American, who does it for several hours a day, every day. Take, say, two hours a night, three nights a week, for a total of six hours. Use that time to learn a subject about which the reader is passionate, a hobby or interest. The subject can be literally anything, from A to Z. If a big subject like history is chosen, it's allowable to narrow it down to, for instance, the French Revolution or the Vietnam War. If a subject like classical music is chosen, go to an occasional concert or try your hand at playing an instrument. Again, if this book was written today, the author might say to use the internetto research your topic, but stay away from the chat rooms. During your learning time (for lack of a better term), lay off the popular novels. The author has nothing against them, but the idea is to give your brain a workout; novels don't do that. Most of all, take your time. The worst thing a person can do is burnout.<br />This book is small, but mighty. It says a lot, and it's the sort of book that can be used by everyone, from one end of society to the other. Not enough time in the day? Not after reading this gem.	2003-08-13

Behaviors like sexuality, aggression and dominance can be found in our animal ancestors and all over human society. Such things are therefore more part of evolution than of culture. It all starts with the chimpanzee, with whom humans share over 98 percent of the same DNA.<br />Humans and chimps have many behavioral similarities, among them, organization by group, territorial defense, xenophobia toward strangers and the ability to experience pain and fear. Human behavior reflects general primate behavior, which goes along with general evolutionary theory.<br />If every case of aggression between two individuals, of any species, led to the death of one of the aggressors, that species would quickly disappear. Many species have found less dangerous ways to show aggression, like ritualized fighting, threat behavior and remotivating displays. The human equivalent is things like a show of military strength and Us vs Them (anyone not part of the \\"group\\" is an outsider, and therefore subhuman). Under the stresses of war, the veneer of civilization leaves our consciences, so even the most cultured individuals are capable of committing atrocities.<br />It could be thought that concepts like a pecking order in society, or dominance and submission are products of our modern world, especially the 1980s yuppie days. All over the animal kingdom, there are examples of a dominant individual heading a group. Did you know that human forms of greeting and the offering of food and drinks to guests are acts of appeasement to inhibit aggression?<br />Why do women wear lipstick, and why is it red (not blue or orange)? The reader can find out the answer for themselves, but it has to do with the rear end of a female chimp.<br />This book is surprisingly good. It's short, and it presents science and human behavior in very easy to understand terms. It's even recommended for those who think that they hate science. This is well worth reading.	2003-08-08

Going through very specialized training, including genetic engineering to bring out their talents, they became part of an organization called I.O. (International Operations) and travelled the world, working for America. That is, until the day they left I.O. with the help of renegade agent and went out on their own.<br />Sarah, also known as Rainmaker, is able to manipulate the weather. Bobby, aka Burnout, is able to turn himself into a ball of flame. Roxy (Freefall) can manipulate gravity. Grunge's ability is to temporarily take on the physical characteristics of whatever he touches, be it metal, water or rubber. Fairchild, the &quot;leader&quot; of the group (first name Caitlin), is impervious to things like bullets fired at her.<br />Halfway to a Bachelor's degree in computers from Princeton when I.O. came calling, Fairchild finds herself at an emotional crossroads. Is this all there is to life? She yearns for a more normal life, like a regular job and a place in the suburbs. She is not the only one with personal stuff going on. Sort of leaving the group, Fairchild goes on a bunch of job interviews. She is disgusted to find that people are more interested in her body than her brain.<br />Around this time, Gen 13 is attacked by someone who knows them inside and out. A devious plan is hatched to take over the world, with help from a stolen Trident nuclear missile. This individual has created a new group of seemingly indestructible genetically engineered people with strange abilities called Gen 14. With Fairchild temporarily absent, things are not looking good for Gen 13 in the battle with their &quot;descendants.&quot;<br />Obviously, fans of the Gen 13 series and comic book fans in general need this novel. For everyone else, this is lighter summertime-type reading that is perfect for the beach or pool. It's very much worth it.	2003-08-08
US	50455329	RBL7WN1A51UXQ	1555175864	879761814	What Parents Need to Know About Sibling Abuse: Breaking the Cycle of Violence	Books	5	16	18	N	N	All families with children need a copy	This book talks about a seldom-discussed issue in present-day America, that of physical and emotional abuse by a member of the family, usually an older brother or sister. There is a strong tendency to keep internal family issues behind closed doors. It's also very easy to dismiss as sibling rivalry, not abuse, or boys will be boys.<br />Abuse can take many different forms, from name-calling to hitting, all the way to rape. The victims are left with feelings of shame, low self-esteem into adulthood and worthlessness. They are threatened by the perpetrator with grievous bodily harm or the breakup of the family if they tell.<br />There are a number of causes of sibling abuse. The usual cause is violence in the media that children see every day. Another major reason for sibling abuse is the model presented by the parents. Do they constantly belittle or try to injure each other? In such a household, how can abuse not be transferred from the parents to the children? How can a child, having been abused by an older sibling, not turn around and do it to a younger sibling?<br />Parental reaction is most important. When confronted with an accusation of abuse, one reaction is to say that the victim must have deserved it. If the accusation is one of sexual abuse, the victim must have enjoyed it. Other parental reactions include ignoring the abuse, responding inconsistently or inappropriately, indifference or even joining in the abuse. No wonder victims frequently don't talk about their abuse for many years.<br />The best thing parents can do is listen to their children. Only a small percentage of abuse allegations turn out to be false. The author also advocates the SAFE method (Stop the abuse; Assess the situation, both facts and feelings; Find out what will keep the abuse from happening again; Evaluate the solution and alter it if necessary).<br />Perhaps one of the causes of the epidemic of violence in America is discussed in this book. Read it if you're a parent who thinks that abuse is happening in your home. Read it if you think you're an abuse survivor, then give this book to your parents. Everyone else should also read this book.	2003-07-29

This was the waning days of the Age of Vikings.<br />As a child, Gunnhild learns the ways of withcraft from a Finnish concubine of her father, a powerful Norse chieftain. She also notices Eirik, son of their king. Growing up, Gunnhild keeps her eyes open and learns the relationship between the powerful and the weak. But she doesn't want to stop there. She becomes a spaewife, a master in witchcraft and sorcery, a knower of the Gods.<br />She marries Eirik, and things are wonderful for a while. She gives him seven sons, all of whom become great warriors, and one daughter, Ragnhild. Forced into a political marriage, Ragnhild gets a reputation as someone whose husbands tend to die before their time. Eirik's strength and Gunnhild's craftiness and knowledge of sorcery make them formidable foes.<br />Haakon, another son of Eirik's father, has an equally strong claim as Eirik to be King of Norway. This is a time of building alliances for both men among the groups in that part of the world. The fortunes of Eirik and Gunnhild start taking a turn for the worst. They are forced to flee Norway and live for a time in York, England. Anotherv time they flee to the Orkney Islands, part of present-day Scotland. Eirik dies in battle, as do his sons, one by one. Meantime, Christianity comes to that part of the world. Haakon embraces this new religion, partly because his best friend becomes a priest. He expects those in aliiance with him to do the same. But, there are those, including powerful people, who are not happy with the old gods being tossed aside.<br />This is a great novel. It's a big novel, both in size and in scope, so it is not easy or quick reading. Once again, Anderson shows why he was a master of the genre. The style of writing gives the impression that it was actually written a thousand years ago. Recently translated, it was mispackaged as Fiction instead of History. Iknow of no other contemporary writer in the field who can consistently do that like Anderson.<br />This book will take some patience, but it is highly recommended.	2003-07-29

Part of it is a multi-generation saga of one family over the last 150 years. It starts with a young woman named Sara Spencer Peek, part of a westward-bound wagon train in the mid 19th century. Back in the present, Bob Thornton is a Wall Street superstar, who, one day, walks away from everything, and heads for Alaska. He's not totally sure where he's going or what he'll do once he gets there, but there has to be more to life than Wall Street. While hitchhiking, he is picked up by Ruben Sanchez, self-educated philosopher. They do a lot of talking about philosophy, most of it centered on the book Moby Dick.<br />Adam Whitehead is a world-renowned physicist doing his best to drop off the face of the earth. Both his parents died of complications from Alzheimer's Disease, and, being of the age where such a thing is a major concern, he is terrified that he will be next. Should it happen, he will end his own life before he ends up in some nursing home. James Tall Tree, the Presidential Science Adviser, calls out the Alaska State Police in almost-desperate search for Whitehead. His theories have led to a major discovery that is about to be released to the public. Tall Tree wants to officially acknowledge Whitehead's contribution.<br />It has become possible to go back in time and watch events as they happen in real time. Going to any coordinates, as long as it was outside and there was no cloud cover, it is possible to go back as far as the cavemen and watch it 'live'. Access to this system will be freely available to anyone with an internet connection. The repercussions for all of human society, especially fields like history and archaeology, will, of course, be cataclysmic.<br />I really enjoyed this book, but it's not for everyone. The reader had better like home-grown, self-educated philosophy, because there is a lot of it in this book. Otherwise, it works as a science fiction novel, as a Jack London-type adventure novel, and it will give the reader plenty to think about. It's very much worth reading.	2003-07-28

It is as if the human race has forgotten the meaning of the word War. That is, until, one day, an alien race called the Paranians land on one of the outlying colony planets. They take many captives, and interrogate them about their defenses. They slaughter everyone else, and then kill the captives when they tell the Paranians nothing. A second and third human planet is attacked, with no sign of any Earth defenses.<br />That's because there are no Earth defenses. The Commonwealth Council, led by a man named Fair Daryl (all of the humans have names like that) is at a loss as to how to respond. Fat William, a resident of a Custodial Care Center (a place for misfits and others who don't fit into society) and a student of military history, has a bold idea. Using mankind's considerable technical knowledge, create the most spohisticated android ever; one that must be able to eat, move and bleed like a human. The android will be programmed with the personality of General George Patton. Only a few people will know that he isn't human.<br />Snow Rose, his \\"creator,\\" falls in love with Patton. While he is away for long periods of time, building an army from nothing, Rose lives in his apartment. She totally neglects her own work and becomes more and more emotionally unglued. One day, after Patton rejects her, she totally loses it and tells him that he's not human.<br />Despite this, Patton continues with his plans against the Paranians. Mankind is slow to respond, both technically and in terms of building an army, but eventually gets going. With new types of weapons and tactics against them, the Paranians find themselves nervously looking over their shoulders, wondering when and where the next attack will occur. After the war ends, Patton plans on continuing into space, not returning to Earth. He knew that if he returned, he would get shut off, like any other machine.<br />Fans of military science fiction will really enjoy this novel. For everyone else, this belongs somewhere in that large gray area of Pretty Good or Worth Reading.	2003-07-24

Before the lines were drawn between fantasy, science fiction and horror, he wrote with a dark vision of the cosmos and a poet's sense of language. This book is an attempt to bring back some of his short fiction, largely un-reprinted.<br />This was a time when scientific plausibility had not yet become a central principle of science fiction. Plot and mind-blowing concepts were more important. On story in this book is about two men, rivals for the same woman, who follow each other on one-way trips to the year 1 million. One of the men makes a tiny, but huge, error in his calculations and arrives almost 2,000 years \\"late.\\" The woman, kidnapped by the other man, is long since dead, but the later man finds that a cult, practically a religion, has grown up around his arrival among her descendants, the last people on earth.<br />What if it could be determined that the entire universe was nothing more than an atom in some incomparably larger universe (and what if that universe was nothing more than an atom in some much larger universe)? A man builds a spaceship capable of traveling thousands of times the speed of light and aims to find out. There are also a number of tales of the end of mankind, in all sorts of interesting ways.<br />In 1938, John W. Campbell took over the editorship of Astounding Science Fiction, where many of these stories first appeared. He forced scientific plausibility and extensive rewrites on his authors, and thereby on the rest of the field. Wandrei found that he could not adjust his writing to suit Campbell, and, by the 1940s, Wandrei basically gave up full-time writing to concentrate on running the specialty publisher Arkham House, which he co-founded. While it introduced authors like H.P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith to a new generation of readers, Wandrei basically forbade the republishing of his stories.<br />I really enjoyed this book. It's quite good asa bit of science fiction history. Sometimes it's good to read stories full of up-to-the-minute science, and other times it's good to read stories like these, about the destruction of humanity or trips to the next universe. It gets a strong recommendation.	2003-06-25

Egar can earn a living with his harp, his juggling and some sleight-of-hand taught by his Master, but how can he &quot;change the course of Frankish history&quot; (according to his Master)?<br />Finding himself in the royal court in Paris, Egar meets Pepin the Vain, nobleman and tutor to Prince Dagobert, son of King Clothar. Egar feels that his destiny is somehow tied to Pepin. Clothar sends Dagobert to rule one of the outlying provinces from a town called Metz. Dagobert is still a child, so Pepin is sent along as Mayor of the Palace (literally, the power behind the throne). Pepin does not have royal blood, but he wants the throne very, very much, and figures this is his chance (he's not called Pepin the Vain for nothing). Dagobert loves the pomp and ceremony of being King, but hates the day-to-day routine; Pepin is only too happy to relieve him of the responsibility for running the palace. One day, Egar, who has accompanied them to Metz, has a vision of a great king; Pepin thinks it's himself, but Egar isn't sure.<br />Years later, Clothar dies, so Dagobert moves to Paris to become King of all Frankish land. Pepin and Egar stay behind in Metz, which, without a monarch in residence, becomes practically a ghost town. They ride to Paris to convince Dagobert to spend part of the year in Metz. They are shocked to find that the queen has been humiliated and forced into a convent, and that the castle has become a place for all-night partying with lots of prostitutes. The day-to-day business of the kingdom is the farthest thing from Dagobert's mind.<br />Pepin's ambition gets the better of him on a later trip to Paris to convince Dagobert to clean up his act. Pepin is confined to the castle, and releived of his position as Mayor of Metz. Egar, with help from some sorcery, races back to Metz to tell pepin's family to flee immediately, just minutes ahead of guards from Dagobert.<br />This one is really good. Pepin feels like a real person (he was a real person; the author can trace her family ancestry back to him), the writing is very well done and shows a lot of research, and, overall, it's well worth the reader's time.	2003-05-23

Something always seems to go wrong, because of a type of manager called the 160 Degree Deviator. These are people with their own agendas who damage company morale and cause frustration to rise. The reason that they aren't called 180 Degree Deviators is that the author gives the company 20 degrees &quot;credit&quot; for having the right idea.<br />The author theorizes that some people are just born jerks, or become that way after exposure to other jerks. Such pompous, overbearing people should never be let anywhere near a management position. Devaitors can be of either gender, and can be found anywhere between foreman and senior management. They are preoccupied with superficial things, like the look of a report instead of what's inside. They dominate all conversations with peers and subordinates, and monopolize meetings. They rarely apologize for a mistake or false accusation, especially when it involves someone lower than them on the company totem pole. They recruit spies to feed them the latest gossip about others. Deviators will only hire or promote those who hold them in high esteem. they use a lot of possessive pronouns, like &quot;my people&quot; or &quot;my department,&quot; as if a piece of the company is their personal property. In short, 160 Degree Deviators have an exaggerated sense of their own self-importance. They consider themselves the center of the universe, and expect to be treated as such. Sound familiar?<br />What to do about such people? It's easy to say that so-and-so is a &quot;kook&quot; or is thinking outside the box; tell that to their subordinates or people in other departments. At all times, challenge Deviators to put up or shut up. Meetings should be called for specific purposes with specific attendees; don't let Anyone monopolize them. People who lie or sacrifice others to cover their mistakes should be immediately dismissed. If Manager X is considered &quot;harmless&quot; by senior management, transfer them someplace where they will be harmless, but get them out of that management job.<br />This book is excellent. A copy is needed in every company in America, Fortune 500 included. The CEO who says &quot;it doesn't happen here&quot; needs to take a closer look at their company. It is highly recommended.	2003-05-14

Written by someone well versed in Chinese law, it outs three of Judge Dee's most famous cases together into one novel. Judge Dee was a district Magistrate, a combination prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner (if necessary). Magistrates had pretty wide authority to interrogate anyone, and use any method to get a confession, including beatings and torture. But, if a Magistrate executed someone who was later found to be innocent (for instance), the Magistrate was executed.<br />In the first case, a pair of silk merchants spend the night at a hostel in a certain town. The next morning, just outside of town, one of them is found dead. The local Warden (the town policeman) immediately accuses the hostel owner of killing, then robbing, the merchant, something the hostel owner vigorously denies. The second case involves a young bride who is poisoned on her wedding night. In the third case, a young widow and her mother live alone. The widow's husband died a year previously under less than clear circumstances. Not only does the young widow lock herself in her room for half a day every day, she also gets very angry and belligerent toward her mother whenever any men come around; not just potential suitors, but any men. As Judge Dee investigates, and interroagtes both women, the circumstances of the husband's death get more and more mysterious.<br />Chinese detective novels are very different than their western counterparts. The culprit is introduced in the beginning of the story, and the interest is in seeing how the crime is solved. They tend to get very detailed, especially concerning the method of torture and execution, so a length of several hundred pages is common. This novel is one of the shorter ones that are available.<br />For mystery lovers who want to read a very different type of novel, this is  worth checking out. Agatha Christie has little to fear from Chinese detective novels regarding competition, but it is still worth the reader's time.	2003-05-12

Spanning the political spectrum, the independent researchers, media critics and other experts behind these pieces (many written especially for this book) blow away the fog that keeps us confused.<br />Greg Palast catches the news media in several blatant lies; not just misinterpretation, but actual, black and white, lies. The most popular antidepressants can cause suicide. The Watergate break-in may have been all about a call girl ring after all. The producer of the CNN report about Operation Tailwind (asserting that America used sarin nerve gas in Vietnam) gives her side of the story. A former federal drug agent describes first-hand how the Drug War is designed to fail. The New York Times knows about, but refuses to publicize, America's illegal bioweapons program. Howard Zinn brings the US bombing of Afghanistan down to the individual level, looking at some of those who suffered and died. Operation Pipeline is a racial profiling program in California that pulls over minorities on the pretext of minor traffic violations. The editor digs up more neglected information on September 11, including: some of the highest US officials admitted that the attacks could have been prevented, a US Senator has said that at least one foreign country actively aided the terrorists, and one of the warnings received by the US was from the Taliban.<br />Also covered in this book are the diamond trade, child protective services, fluoridation, the Resurrection story, government sponsored anti-drug ads, the US military faces a huge rape crisis, the flexible definition of \\"terrorism,\\" and corporations that have claimed the \\"right\\" to lie.<br />As with its two prequels, Everything You Know Is Wrong and You Are Being Lied To, this is a must read of a book that has something to upset or offend everyone. I learned a lot from these eye-opening articles. This isn't a \\"liberal\\" or\\"conservative\\" book, but it is very highly recommended.	2003-05-08

Brice Stockton travels from Texas to pick up the body of Peter, his older brother, who has died in a suicide pact with Diane Cabel, of the wealthy Suffolk Cabels. It seems like a straightforward, but gruesome, task. When he gets there, not only is he denied entrance to the estate, but Brice is told that Peter has already been buried, contrary to the wishes of the Stockton family. He is also told of the Cabel curse. A curse can be something other than perpetual bad luck.<br />Once Brice practically forces himself onto the estate, he finds an eccentric family who have seen better days. Moorefield is the family patriarch, Wolf is his son and heir (along with being an arrogant you-know-what) and Maida is his daughter. Ainsley, another son, is a congenital imbecile. There are also a number of servants.<br />The police are not very helpful, because of the Cabels influence, but the coffins are dug up, only to find that theyre both empty. Brice begins to get the idea that Diane and Peter didnt kill themselves. Suspicion falls on one of the servants, who is killed by Wolf just before he was going to confess. During a hunting trip, Wolf and several of his men attempt to kill Brice and make it look like an accident. He barely escapes by jumping into a nearby lake, where he finds the bodies of Peter and Diane. Suspicion then falls on Maida, who is being treated by a local doctor, who also happens to be a hypnotist. Not only is she being sexually assaulted while under hypnosis, but just enough of a post-hypnotic suggestion is planted in her mind to make Maida think that maybe she is actually guilty of murder. For a time, suspicion also falls on Ainsley. Brice also learns that Maida is holding a major secret over Wolfs head concerning Ainsley. If Moorefield got even an inkling of this secret, Wolf would be disinherited so fast it would make his head spin. Just to make things more interesting, on more than one occasion, Brice sees Peter and Diane actually walking through the house. They arent some ghostly see-through apparition, but solid enough to reach out and touch. Through it all, Brice is drawn deeper and deeper into the depths of his own soul.<br />This book has it all. Its got a mansion with secret passages and wings that have been closed for years, its got dark family secrets, several dead bodies, a bit of sex, strange goings-on and a really well done story. This fine piece of Victorian horror writing is very much worth reading.	2003-04-29

One day, he opens the newspaper and sees a picture of little brother, fronting a popular rock music band. Overnight, the older brother's life is turned upside down, as he goes from being an average college professor to brother of a famous rock star. A westerner living in Japan, accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, watches as his innocence slowly disappears.<br />A woman and her fiance are eating in an [trendy] restaurant. Suddenly, she notices an older gentleman a few tables away and screams. The fiance takes her home immediately, and after a good night's sleep, it's as if the incident in the restaurant never happened. A couple of times, the woman says \\"I won't hurt you,\\" for seemingly no reason at all. The object of her emotional reaction, an actor, appeared in a film a few years previously. It's about a man who befriends a little girl, takes her shopping for a doll, then drugs her, undresses her and photographs her, but otherwise doesn't harm her.<br />A police officer in present-day Bangkok, Thailand, after reuniting a lost boy with his frantic parents, tells of how his own son, a schizophrenic, committed suicide. Perhaps those who hear voices in their heads are the sane ones, and the rest of us, who can't hear them, are insane.<br />These stories are really good. Hoffman has done a fine job throughout. They are easy to read, with real people as characters and are highly recommended.	2003-04-29

Perhaps their parents never taught them the value of it, or their husband wanted to shield them from the financial world by saying that women shouldn't get their hands dirty with money. This book aims to change that.<br />It's natural to feel anxious and ashamed about your lack of money knowledge when everyone around you is financially on top of the world. Start with something simple like balancing the checkbook. Remember that hubby won't be around forever, either through death or divorce, so becoming familiar with the family finances is a very good idea.<br />Tell a neighbor or best friend, someone you can confide in, your fears and fantasies about money. She may be in the same position as you, but afriad to admit it. Don't be afriad to ask the \\"dumb\\" questions about money; perhaps together, you can find the answer. Listen to stories from other women about money; not how much they saved, but how they saved, through investing, budgeting, etc.<br />The author leaves the more specific money-saving tips until the end, but her biggest recommendation is to get rid of your credit card debt. With interest rates at anywhere up to 20 percent and with the average credit card debt at several thousand dollars per person, paying off that debt as fast as possible is the single best thing anyone can do to save money.<br />Acken knows something about women's fears concerning money. Growing up in a Baltimore record store, she could make change from an early age, but never learned what money was all about. Years later, a divorced mother of two, she found herself with a PhD in psychology and a $50,000 student debt. She learned about money real fast.<br />For those who get nervous and panicky in the personal finance section of the local chain bookstore, this book is for you. It's written in a very down-to-earth style and is very easy to read. It's recommended for women of any socio-economic status. This isn't rocket science; like the title says It's Only Money!	2003-04-29

This book aims to change that.<br />The first step for any person is to decide just what they want out of life. What is their heart's desire? Is it better to be happy, or to have a closer relationship with the Creator? The come a series of things that anyone can do during the day to incorporate spirituality into their lives.<br />When you get up in the morning, take several deep breaths and some stretching exercises to get yourself ready for the day. Try singing, or yoga or color visualization. During the day, think before you speak. Pay attention to where you put your energy. At noontime, take a moment of silence or say noontime prayers. It sounds like a cliche, but, on the way home from work, stop and smell the roses. Bless and appreciate your evening meal. Express your gratitude for the day just finished. At bedtime, send healing prayers to anyone who may need them. Write down things from the day for which you are grateful.<br />Included is a list of things that can be done at any time during the day. Take time to visualize your future. Replace meat products with natural alternatives. Stay Clean. Try not to take on too much. Take the time to unclutter and reorganize. Remember where people are coming from emotionally. Stop worrying. In short, make the most of everyday.<br />Perhaps one of the reasons for all the strife and discord today is the decreasing importance of spirituality in people's lives. This book doesn't push any particular religion or conception of &quot;God.&quot; The suggestions included can be done by people of any religion. For anyone who wants to keep a spiritual connection in today's world, or anyone wanting to fix a &quot;broken&quot; connection, this book is an excellent place to start. It's a very quick read, and it says a lot.	2003-04-29

The problem is, they are all written by doctors or forty-something fitness gurus. This is written by a \\"real\\" person, a pharmacist in her seventies.<br />Her biggest recommendation is to take control of your own health and well-being. No matter how wonderful your doctor or pharmacist is, they won't do it for you. Educate yourself about, for instance, supplements and alternative medicine. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Is drug B really necessary, or is it simply counteracting side effects from drug A? Drink lots of water, and, if applicable, change your status from smoker to ex-smoker.<br />A big reason for America's health problems is the American diet. It's full of all sorts of artificial, pre-processed, fat and chemical-filled stuff that bears little resemblance to real food. Reduce the amount of such things that you put in your mouth. Eliminating it entirely would be even better.<br />Part of the secret is attitude, which starts with the word \\"retirement.\\" If you're physically and mentally able to keep working, don't retire just because you have reached \\"retirement age.\\" If you're retiring to do something you have always wanted to do, go for it. On the other hand, if you're retiring to move into some retirement community and wait for the Grim Reaper, you need more help than this book can provide.<br />Morris also recommends living in an environment that includes young people; they can be a pain in the neck, but their energy can be contagious. Avoid people and organizations that say \\"the end is near.\\" Develop a positive sense of humor and outlook on life. Stand apart from the masses. Don't abandon long-term plans just because you think you have X years left.<br />To those who aren't ready to leave the workforce, or leave this Earth, just because their body has reached a certain chronological age, this book is for you. It's very easy to read, it's from a regular person intendedfor regular people, and anyone can learn a lot from it. This is very highly recommended.	2003-03-31

The fundamental nature of the cosmos is such that all life contains spirit (specific and varying segments of perfection, or whatever God consists of) and that it is able to rise to higher levels, eventually terminating in none other than God Himself.<br />Did you know that the universe has an impenetrable boundary? The solar system is rushing toward it, but the period of time before it will become a problem can be measured in millions of years.<br />The author spends much of the book exposing several large holes in the Big Bang theory of universe creation. He asserts that the observable evidence just doesn't add up. A much better theory is that of Continouos Creation (a series of smaller Bangs). At a certain point, universe expansion turns into universe contraction, eventually leading to another Small Bang. Most of his other objections to the Big Bang were beyond this reviewer.<br />Allen takes the reader painlessly through cosmology, starting with the earth, the sun and the solar system, and spreading out to nearby stars, quasars, black holes and continuing on to nearby galaxies. He does a fine job at &quot;layman level&quot; science, but the point comes at which previous knowledge of cosmology would help. For professional scientists, and those who simply want a different view of the universe, this book is well worth reading.	2003-02-12

A couple of teachers along the way attempt to \\"reach\\" him, thinking that he is some sort of troubled teen, when a much better diagnosis might be \\"smart but bored with school.\\"<br />He has a variety of jobs during this time, including spending a couple of years working behind the counter of a local bike shop. It's the sort of place where items like air guns and super glue are used in all sorts of intesesting ways. After high school, he intentionally gets out of town and enrolls in a sort of alternative college in Arizona to learn search and rescue. He leaves there after he finds that the school is the sort of place where the faculty would rather look at the goodness inside each of the students than actually teach search and rescue. During this time, Grundle Ink Publications is born, as Greg hand binds copies of his writings and hands them out to friends.<br />Everett eventually ends up in the college town of Chico, California, where Grundle Ink becomes more of a \\"full-time\\" job. The fact that he knows absolutely nothing about the publishing business is irrelevant; nothing like learning the hard way. He also makes several attempts to get off drugs.<br />Throughout this book are many relationships with the opposite sex. Some of the women Everett meets are decent, reasonable people, while others can best be described as one-dimensional idiots. He is unable to break off the relationship, so he intentionally acts like a jerk until the woman gets frustrated and does the breaking up. The conversations recounted are not literary masterpieces; sometimes, they consist of little more than \\"dude\\" and \\"(insert swear word).\\"<br />Because of the very large amounts of drugs and swearing in this book, it is not for the faint of heart. To attempt to understand youth culture of the 1990s, this does an infinitely better job than the various stories and films of adolescent hijinks. The writing is honest, sobering, and, in places, very funny. I loved it.	2003-02-12

Its unfettered access to that country during the war and its showing of the bin Laden tapes made it an automatic force on the world stage.Based in the Gulf state of Qatar, it came from the remnants of the BBC Arabic TV service. With the help of startup money from the Emir of Qatar, Al-Jazeera was to have complete editorial independence.In a part of the world where the press is usually government controlled, Al-Jazeera is not afraid to get specific and name names. At one time or another, it has been criticized or condemned by seemingly every government in the Arab world, for broadcasting things that the local government would prefer not be broadcast. Every local editorial of condemnation and every denial of press credentials to Al-Jazeera reporters just increases its audience all over the world by satellite.One of the things that Al-Jazeera is most known for is its talk shows, especially a nightly, two-hour show called The Opposite Direction. Two guests appear on the show, with totally opposite opinions on a certain issue, and with help from live phone calls, the sparks fly. Even by American TV standards, things get pretty loud and lively. Arab governments have noticed, and have begun imitating the format on their tame and boring government TV channels.Even though Al-Jazeera is an Arab TV channel, it has tried very hard to be impartial, hosting members of the Bush Administration, after September 11, and government officials from Israel.For those who want to decide for themselves if Al-Jazeera is a legitimate news broadcaster or a terrorist mouthpiece, this book is highly recommended. It's comprehensive, clearly written and is quite enlightening.	2003-01-25

Formerly a thriving, close-knit place to live, the street is in the process of being gentrified out of existence.<br />Jamal, a graffiti artist who calls himself \\"Sketch,\\" lives with his grandmother. Jamal's father, Ranger, came back from Vietnam a cocaine addict and spends most of his time living on the streets. Ironically, just when Ranger seems to have his addiction actually conquered, he is caught in the middle of a drive-by shooting. Because of the family's built-up resentments and recriminations, a period of emotional turmoil results, and, each in their own way, the family comes out the other end stronger and more united than ever.<br />The family is helped in their journey by an older, eccentric woman named Victoria. Never one to venture outside without looking \\"presentable,\\" her obsession (?) grew until she reached the point where she dressed all in white, including white pancake makeup on her African-American skin, and believed herself to be invisible. She is accompanied by the book's narrator, the spirit of a 300-year-old African slave, who has \\"adopted\\" Victoria for the time being.<br />This story works in several different ways. It's a must read for urban residents forced to watch the transformation of their neighborhood into something unrecognizable. It does a very good job at showing one family's attempt to come to grips with the legacy of the Vietnam War. For those who like their fiction with a touch of strange, the author does a fine job with the Latin American magic realism. This novel is well worth the search, and well worth reading.	2002-11-27

They are grouped into categories like Vegetarianism in Daily Life, Nutrition, Food Ingredients, Travel and Restaurants, Cooking and Baking, Soy and Veggie Kids.<br />Here are a few examples of the questions answered in this book. Where can I find vegan marshmallows? At the moment, there aren't any. Is it true that Krispy Kreme donuts are vegan? No. Does guacamole contain gelatin? Some processed kinds do, but fresh guacamole is often gelatin-free. I just found out gummy bears are made with gelatin. Is there a veggie bear available? Yes. My daughter is raising her infant son on a vegan diet. Should I be worried? Not if the child is getting adequate nutrition. Why do people become vegetarian? Among the many reasons are dislike of meat, belief in non-violence, compassion for animals, and health, cological and religious concerns. Are there vegan flu vaccines? No, because vaccine materials are generally grown on egg-based media. Is photographic film really made of cow bones? Yes. Can I be a vegan and an athlete? Yes. Does bone china really have bones in it? Yes. Is tattoo ink vegan? Ask your tattooist.<br />The book also contains a number of vegetarian recipes, and has a large appendix including a quick guide to fast food, a senior's (and athlete's) guide to good nutrition, a feeding plan for infants and toddlers, and the protein content of selected fast foods.<br />This is an excellent one-stop resource for all things vegetarian.

Plugging into the discontent of the people, the Presidential election becomes a marathon as results take much longer than expected, or are changed more than once. The election is declared inconclusive, so attention shifts to the Electoral College. Some states just happen to have a law on their books saying that the Electoral College elector doesn't have to vote the way the state did during the election. The political chaos continues as the next stop is the House of Representatives. Fourcade supporters encourage the House to choose Buck as President by surrounding the US Capitol with a ring of four million supporters. Congress gets the message, and Buck Fourcade is soon sworn in as President. He quickly sets about changing things in Washington, promising to run America like a business. He changes the Cabinet positions into Vice President For positions, cracks down on corporations who don't pay taxes and institutes Government By 1-900 Number. (Remember Ross Perot in 1992?)<br />This is seen through the eyes of Doug Murphy, middle-level employee of Continental Brewing, and living in the Midwest town of Brookville. He is your typical apathetic person who totally believes in the American Dream. Still, he notes the increasing number of For Sale signs and closed businesses in town, along with wave after wave of layoffs at work. He also notices how some of the town's leading citizens are not just Fourcade supporters, but obsessed with him.<br />That obsession turns to anger when Fourcade is assassinated. Seeing plenty of \\"suspects,\\" they take to the streets, letting out their anger on anything and everything. Doug watches as things like newspaper delivery, street repair and trash pickup become things of the past. The situation in Washington can best be described as \\"chaotic.\\" Policies of the past 20 or 30 years, like running up a multi-trillion dollar debt and printing paper money withoutthe gold to back it up, come to the forefront. What passes for a national government divides the country into security zones and deploys troops to quell the growing internal rebellion. Canada and Mexico move troops to their borders to stop fleeing Americans. As unemployment skyrockets (Doug is one of the victims), the only businesses left are convenience stores, sporting goods stores (suppliers of knives and guns) and those run by Fourcade supporters.<br />This is not an optimistic novel, but it is very much a Must Read. It's also quite spooky (not so much \\"horror movie\\" spooky as \\"very plausible\\" spooky). For those, like Doug Murphy, who are total believers in the American Dream, this book may just change your mind.	2002-11-01

This isn't a \\"liberal\\" or \\"conservative\\" book, since the authors come from all over the political spectrum.<br />The Vatican Bank, with the Pope as sole shareholder, has been involved in financial scams, tax evasion and money laundering of Nazi gold. Some groups have an interest (usually financial) in taking the tiny number of Americans who belong to hate groups and making them into a tidal wave about to engulf the whole country. Conventional wisdom says that Henry Lee Lucas was one of the biggest serial killers in American history. On more than one occasion, he confessed to any murder put in front of him, even if he wasn't in the same state at the time (the police usually didn't care about that part), to increase his chances of going to the electric chair. Many witnesses say that there was a third, older, shooter that day at Columbine High School.<br />Mad cow disease is spreading virtually unchecked in America. There is a very graphic look at what a meat-based diet is all about, for animals and for humans. Another piece is titled, \\"Psychiatric Drugging of Children for Behavioral Control.\\" It is a mistake to assume that all disabled people want to be \\"cured.\\" Despite their high-sounding words in public, in private, all major religions subjugate women and treat them as inferior to men. Press coverage of the Branch Davidian siege at Waco, Texas, consisted of little more than FBI press conferences, and bore little relation to the truth. In many large cities and smaller towns, seeing the money to be made from crime, police have become the crooks. A piece by the editor detailing the large number of warnings received by the US government before the September 11 attacks, is, by itself, worth the price of the book.<br />I loved this book. Like its prequel \\"You Are Being Lied To\\", this book is full of information that will never be covered in the American news media. There is something here to upset or offend everyone. This book is extremely highly recommended.	2002-07-26

In a land that's perpetually at peace, Kirila tries her hand at the usual things a Princess does, like hunting and creating a tapestry. After her eighteenth birthday, she gets increasingly moody and short-tempered, taking it out on the castle staff. One day, she decides to go on a solo Quest to find the True Heart of the World. All she knows is that it is somewhere to the north, and it has to do with the Tents of Omnium.<br />Kirila soon comes upon a talking dog, with blue-black fur, named Chessie. He says he was a human prince who was turned into a dog by a wizard. Chessie is also going to the Tents of Omnium, the only place to get unenchanted. They spend some time at the Quirkian Hold, something like a monastery, whose purpose is to make order of all things in the universe. Their four clans are Up, Down, Strange and Charmed. Some feel that is enough to explain everything, while others feel that the Model of Forces may need some revision by adding another clan.<br />Later, they meet Prince Larek of Castle Talatour. He is handsome, single and totally obsessed with jousting. The castle is the smallest, most poorly maintained castle Kirila has ever seen. Nevertheless, she accepts Larek's marriage proposal. Chessie continues his Quest to the Tents of Omnium.<br />Twenty-five years later, after Kirila has borne a couple of children, buried Larek, who lost a battle with a wild boar, and started to experience middle age and arthritis, Chessie returns. He got almost to Omnium, but was stopped by a sort of magical force field. On the spur of the moment, Kirila decides to continue the Quest. After several adventures, they reach the Tents of Omnium, where Chessie returns to human form.<br />This novel is really good. It starts off with some tongue-in-cheek humor, then gets a lot better. Here is a first-rate combination of psychology and fable that is quite entertaining.	2002-07-24
US	50455329	R2UH49FWQC869K	0802150411	488797620	World Hunger: Twelve Myths	Books	5	27	31	N	N	An excellent resource	Over the years, many myths have emerged about the subject of world hunger. People think that if this or that should happen, hunger will disappear, and no longer will westerners have to look at pictures of starving babies in Africa. This book explodes many of those myths.<br />Some people think that population (or overpopulation) is the problem. Others think that there simply isn't enough food available, or that nature, with her floods and droughts, is the culprit. Still others think that the solution lies with free trade, or letting the market provide, or with the Green Revolution, with its heavy emphasis on pesticides and other chemicals. Other possibilities are that the poor are simply too hungry to revolt, or that the US should increase its stingy foreign aid budget.<br />The authors place the blame elsewhere. All over the world, there has been a huge concentration of land in fewer and fewer hands, forcing poor and middle-class peasants off the land (in the US, witness the decline of the family farmer). Structural adjustment programs from places like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (part of the requirements when asking for a loan) require a country to reorient its agriculture toward items that are easily exportable rather than items that can feed their people. Another requirement is the removal of internal tariffs and other barriers to the import of grain and other foodstuffs. It results in a flood of cheaper (usually American) agricultural products reaching the market, driving local farmers out of business. The countries that one thinks of when hearing \\"famine\\" actually produce enough food to feed their people. The only problem is that much of it has to go overseas to help pay the foreign debt.<br />This book is excellent. It presents a potentially complex subject in a clear, easy to understand manner. It contains a list of addresses to contact for more information, and is a great activism reference.	2002-05-16

He has several suits, all of the same color and style, that he alternates wearing to work. At work, he is the sort of person who does only the work expected of him, doesn't socialize with his co-workers, and eats his lunch (the same thing every day) on the same park bench, being sure to sit on a different part of the bench each day. If, for instance, there is a spot of dirt on the bench, Peter uses his own Graduated Dirt Rating Scale (GDRS), which considers things like the size, color, location and texture of the spot. Peter then decides if it is minor dirt, to be ignored, or major contamination, to be avoided at all costs. Peter lives in his own world of mathematical precision, strange rituals and a dread of contamination.<br />One day, at the park bench, Peter meets John, a lifelong mental patient who is in a local day program. John is a chain smoker who claims to be able to smoke using only one lung at a time. At first, Peter does his best to ignore John, who doesn't seem to know when to stop talking. As time goes on, Peter makes his daily visits from John part of his precise, ordered world.<br />John tells the story of being on a bus to Nebraska. On the bus, he meets a woman named Anna, who is willing to have sex with him on the bus. Anna is also on psychiatric medication and stuck in a loveless Hasidic Jewish marriage. Each summer, she intentionally goes off her medication and impulsively gets on a bus, not knowing, or caring, where it is going. Her husband has to go pick her up, wherever she is, and bring her back home, where she gets back on her medication, and returns to \\"normal\\" in time for Yom Kippur.<br />While living in Nebraska, John gets into the local day program and starts to fit in. As a consumer of pornography (so is Peter), John searches for the local \\"source.\\" He finds one video store, where everything is kept behind the front desk and must be requested by name. Despite this, the town considers forming a commission to stamp out pornography. John starts making pro-pornography noises and gets thrown out of town.<br />Written by a clinical psychologist, this is a fascinating, and quite eye-opening, look at mental illness from the \\"inside\\". It also says a lot about the \\"helping professions.\\" It is very much worth reading.	2002-04-21

'Tis a very strange place.<br />Tony Endless had gotten a job working for a local pest exterminator. On his first job, he took out the firearms carried by everyone in Beerlight and wiped out the dog, cat and aquarium in the house, not realizing that they were ot the pests in question. Word got around town, and now Tony has a business breaking into houses at night, quietly removing pets that the owners want gone, and, just as quietly, giving them to owners that do want them. <br />Ben Stalkeye and chance don't go together very well. The strangest and most unlikely things would happen, only on the condition that he didn't want them to happen. This presented problems for his criminal career. Joe Solitary loved the feeling that came from being the subject of false accusation and did everything possible to be arrested and jailed for crimes in which he was not involved at all. He would go to the police station all the time and confess to anything and everything.<br />In a place where paranoia is a part of daily life, Carl Overchoke had gone back for seconds and thirds. One day, he is told that \\"they\\" are on to him. Carl is an average guy who suddenly feels very important. He starts acting more self-assured, almost like a big shot, seeing spies everywhere, and eventually does gain the notice of the police. Jesse downtime didn't know how to rob anyone, so he experimented with smaller and smaller thefts. He tore the stalk from an apple at the local deli. He broke into the state zoo at night to steal an ant, then return it to the authorities. He would bump into people on the street, acquiring dozens of their atoms without suspicion. After his release, his thievery was refined to such a point that it occurred only in his mind(...)	2002-01-16

This book aims to change that.<br />The authors show how parents can help their children can get a real education by helping the child find something about which they are interested, and proceed from there. The process includes five phases:<BR>OPPORTUNITY-Don't just expose your kids to life's possibilities (arts, science, history, community, etc.) without overdoing it, the parent should also stay passionate and involved in learning. The enthusiasm will be contagious.<BR>TIMING-If your child is not progressing according to some school bureaucrat's schedule, don't panic. Not every child learns at the same speed. Early bloomers may need extra stimulation to keep them interested. Late bloomers may simply need time and extra help.<BR>INTEREST-Honor your child's passions, even if it something of which you disapprove. Children are her to grow into the best person they can be, not what the parent or anyone else thinks they should be. Also know when to back off.<BR>FREEDOM-Give the child the chance to take on projects and solve problems. Make it clear that promises are expected to be kept, and also make clear the consequnces for broken promises.<BR>SUPPORT-Be there for your kids. Supporting children does not equal martyrdom. Check to see how much support they need or want. Make sure their goals stay theirs. Well-being is most important.<br />I learned a lot from this book. It easily reaches the level of Highly Recommended, especially for any parent whose child is having problems in school.	2002-01-11

It doesn't believe in placing faith in a deity or philosophy where matters are accepted on faith and held to be true for all time. <br />In early days, religion was used to explain natural occurrences like life and death, summer and winter. People now have scientific answers to such questions. Humanism is a philosophy without heaven, divine revelation or sacred scriptures, so humanists fix their attention on this life.<br />To a humanist, God can be thought of as nature, as goodness in people or the way things work in the universe. An impersonal conception of God is not necessarily rejected, but there are better ways to express these parts of nature. The truthfulness of sacred scripture like the Bible or Koran is less important than how well they serve as inspirational guides for some people. Some humanists do go to church, in more liberal congregations like Quaker, methodist, liberal Jewish, or Unitarian-Universalist.<br />There are two elements that make up the Humanist approach to personal problem solving. The first is a state of mind of self-reliance and confidence. There are perfectly natural reasons for people's actions, not the conjunction of the planets or the configuration of crystals. The second is to keep an open mind and be reluctant to jump to conclusions.<br />Knowing absolutely nothing about Humanism before starting this book, I had no idea what to expect. The authors do a fine job at painlessly taking the reader through Humanism. Anyone who is not satisfied with, or oherwise questioning, their present religion, could do a lot worse than read this book.	2001-12-31

Vermont: Sibling Rivalry Between the Twin States	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Interesting book about New England	New Hampshire and Vermont are two small, lightly populated states stuck next to each other in northern New England. Little does anyone know that a major feud has been going on between them for years, a feud that won't end anytime soon. The feud is explored in this book by contributors from both sides of the fence.<br />Vermont has its liberal political outlook and its statewide ban on highway billboards. New Hampshire, on the other hand, is very conservative and its first in the country Presidential primary makes it the center of the American political universe every four years. People in Vermont wear funny sandals and talk about world peace. New Hampshire residents sell liquor at toll booths and drive without seat belts. The one thing they agree on is their dislike of Mssachusetts.<br />Every weekend the roads are full of European sedans in custom colors packed with casual clothing and the latest sporting equipment bearing Massachusetts plates. Every driver is in a major hurry to relax; woe to anyone who gets in front of them on the road. But, once they get outside of Massachusetts, they stop at every stone wall, covered bridge and quain country store so quickly that they activate their car's air bags. The other thing that people from Massachusetts do on weekends is shop at outlet malls. Seeing (or more accurately, hearing) several women all wearing noisy nylon jogging suits, and making a beeline for the nearest sale rack, is something to behold.<br />Vermont looks like a postcard. New Hampshire's largest city, Manchester, has a main street that concludes in a dead end. People in Vermont go out to eat and listen to National Public Radio. The first thing one sees in New Hampshire is a toll booth where the attendant has trouble making change from a $5 bill, followed by a state liquor store.<br />This book is hilarious and a little eye-opening for this native New Englander. It equally insults the people of both states, it's very easy to read, and is highly recommended.	2001-12-31

His idea of flooding the offending government with letters, telegrams and unpleasant publicity was derided at the time as silly. Over the years, AI has kept its emphasis on those prisoners who do not use or advocate violence, and has stayed as non-partisan as possible in various international disputes while double and triple-checking all information it receives. Today, with members in over 160 countries, Amnesty International is the world's most influential private organization dealing with human rights.<br />This book looks at the difficulties faced by AI in its work around the world. Nigeria is the home of AI's most famous political prisoner, Olusegun Obasanjo (now President of Nigeria). Amnesty's attention to detail and fine detective work exposed the massacre of more than 100 children in the Central African Republic. Political freedom in China seems to go through phases of openness, only to be slammed shut by the government. The book also deals with death squads in Guatemala and attempts to bring former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to justice.<br />The author also explores human rights in America. Around the world, America is the first one to say something to other countries whose human rights records are less-than-perfect. But, looking at America's domestic record of police brutality, racial profiling and inability to ratify various human rights conventions and treaties, the word &quot;hypocrisy&quot; comes to mind.<br />This is a fine piece of writing. Those who are already active in the human rights field, and those who just want to know something about AI (before becoming members) will learn a lot from this book. Highly recommended.	2001-12-04

He works at a fish market in the French Quarter, a position he inherited from his now deceased father. On one side Albert faces a tightly knit Irish Catholic community, and the strict expectations that go along with it. On the other side is Albert's own preoccupation with unrequited love. Struggling with a self-image that is slowly falling apart, Albert puts his relationship with his community, his family and his daughter all at risk.<br />Albert is trying to live despite the shadow of the memory of his father. Fitting into his father's clothes too easily, or playing poker with his father's friends don't make it any easier. Things are made worse by the feeling that his role is diminishing in the life of Eileen, the mother of his daughter (the two aren't married), and in the life of Audrey, his daughter.<BR>Pulling himself away more and more from friends and family, Albert finds himself in a doomed romantic fantasy. If only he could win the heart of the beautiful and unobtainable Chelsea (who works at a local hotel restaurant) his whole life would take a turn for the better. The biggest problem is that Chelsea makes it clear that she is only interested in a casual friendship.<br />This is a very quiet, and very good, psychological sort of novel about one person's slide into emotional oblivion. The author does a very good job showing the good, the bad and the ugly of a real human life--the aspirations, the messiness and the disappointments. It is very much worth reading.	2001-10-04

He learns to put the suffering he witnesses out of his mind until he becomes rich enough to buy his own fleet of ships.<br />In the meantime, he meets, and marries Robin Larrimore, a &quot;god-kneeler&quot; from upper class Boston society. To enhance his wealth and position, she goads him into getting back into the slave trade. He refuses, and is forced into bankruptcy when his ships fail to return. <br />He travels to San Francisco in the midst of the Gold Rush days. He finds that the Polar Star has been drydocked and turned into a floating brothel owned by Lin Thai-Saing, a totally unscrupulous person. A native of Hong Kong, he moved to San Francisco when the local competition got too fierce. Thai-Saing has forced Caralina, a ten-year-old Italian girl with a beautiful singing voice to work for him as a sing-song girl.<br />Atherton gets on Thai-Saing's bad side, and is almost killed by a couple of his assassins when Atherton tries gold prospecting to buy another fleet of ships. When he recovers, Atherton becomes a Wells Fargo messenger, with the authority to carry a gun and use it.<br />Thai-Saing legally sells Caralina to a Mormon doctor for $2500 in gold. He then bribes a judge to issue a fugitive arrest warrant for her and sends a couple of his goons to get her back. Atherton's authority and willingness to use his gun ultimately foils the plan.<br />This is a very interesting and well-done story. It gives the feeling of being historically and socially accurate, and is a fine piece of writing.	2001-03-16

On one side is the National Weapons Federation, headed by actor Winston Lawton. Out west, Michael Klyter is the head of an obscure militia group.He and his wife start an &quot;independent&quot; foundation to give money to conservative politicians just before the family moves to Washington so Michael can assume a senior position with the NWF. Reverend Jim Pennington is host of the nationally televised Fellowship Club. There is also a smattering of venal, self-serving politicians and right-wing radio talk show hosts who make little or no attempt at on-air impartiality. On the other side is the radical People Against Handguns who conduct an aggressive guerilla campaign against the NWF and Rev. Pennington.<br />Aside from its long-term goal of getting a gun into every home in America, the NWF is pushing a bill in Congress called the Citizen Self-Defense and Crime Control Bill. It would exempt from punishment anyone who uses a gun to stop a crime. The NWF feel they have the numbers to pass it over a promised Presidential veto. Both sides pull out all the stops on this bill and turn Washington into the political equivalent of a war zone. Things get really interesting when the President crashes an NWF rally in Washington and suggests that he might push for repeal of the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.<br />This book will get thrown across a lot of rooms. Sometimes, those are the best kind of books, those that grab the reader by the lapels and violently shake them. Love it or hate it, no one will be ambivalent about this book. I loved it, and can highly recommend it.	2001-02-24

Do you know someone who is passionate about comic books, and it's hard to understand the attraction of something more suited for children than adults? If so, this book is for you.<br />The author does a very good job at surveying the present-day culture around comic books. The readers of the classic superhero type of comics (Batman, Superman, etc.) are overwhelmingly male. The stories don't appeal to women very much, and women are usually portrayed as barely clothed, and with gravity-defying breasts. He also explores the rise of alternative comics (small press, or self-published, books whose subject matter can be practically anything), where female cartoonists and readers, and older readers, tend to go.<br />Fans tend to get very possessive about &quot;their&quot; character. If the writer takes things in an undesired direction, fans have no problems with saying so, in no uncertain terms. One of the things limiting the growth in popularity of comic books is the requirement on the part of the reader of comic literacy. Unless the reader can start with Issue 1, there are usually too many &quot;in&quot; jokes, or too many things talked about in previous issues, for the new reader to totally understand it all.<br />This one is very good. It covers a lot of ground, and in a way that a novice and veteran can understand. Personally, I am not much of a comic book reader, but after reading this, I think I'll visit my local comic book store to see what is on the racks.	2001-01-25

One day, he receives word that Sen, his son and a fellow member of the NYPD, has been killed. Even though Lou wasn't exactly the model father, he is on the next plane to New York, forcing himself into the official investigation. <br />The trouble is, there isn't any official investigation. Normally, cops will stop at nothing to catch a cop killer. But, accusations that Sean was a drug dealer and had a Swiss bank account with many zeros in it serve to cool any official desire to solve the case. So, Lou investigates on his own.<br />He runs into Chris Preston, Sean's former partner, and former lover. She is young enough to be Lou's daughter. Their relationship can best be described as volatile; when they aren't ready to explode in each other's faces, they manage to fall in love with each other. A couple of attempts on their lives show that they're closing in on the killer.<br />I really enjoyed this novel. The settings and atmosphere are very realistic, and the author certainly knows his way around police procedures. Ed McBain, look behind you!	2001-01-06

One day, Edsel Relic, high school outcast who became a performance poet, gets a phone call from his unrequited high school sweetheart, asking if he will attend the upcoming 25th reunion. This sets Edsel off on a freewheeling remembrance of his life up to that point.<br />He was picked on in high school by the jocks because of stuttering (later diagnosed as Tourette's Syndrome). After surviving high school, he went to New York City to become the next Great Hipster Poet (this was during the time of the Beat Generation). When that didn't work, he was forced to return home to his parent's house, and enroll in a local college. Edsel's coming-of-age was fueled with pot, and a &quot;soundtrack&quot; by people like John Coltrane.<br />Frazer writes this story as a very worthy equivalent of improvisational jazz. He switches points of view from Edsel, to the jocks who picked on him in high school, to the local hipsters, and back again. He also changes the story from straight prose to TV scripts to stream-of-consciousness ranting, and includes a special guest appearance by the most trusted man in America, Walter Cronkite.<br />I really enjoyed this story. It's a very good novel for those of us whose high school memories were less than happy. It also belongs right up there with the best of people like Jack Kerouac.	2000-12-31

An intensive search yields nothing, until, by chance, a secret passage is found under the surface. It leads to a base used by a group of humanoid aliens called Matusians, where the two geologists are safe and sound. The Matusians have been watching Earth for many years, but their existence must remain a secret until their starship arrives in about 30 years. Until then, their moonbase is defenseless against any earth dictator with missiles who fear that the Matusians upset the status quo.<br />The secret doesn't stay secret for long, and the Matusians are forced to reveal themselves to the people of Earth. The keepers of the status quo, including the American president, don't take this lying down. A plan is hatched where nuclear bombs are secretly transoprted to the moon. One is placed outside the entrance to the Matusian base, and the other is hidden inside Earth's lunar base. The idea is to make it look like the Matusians attacked and destroyed the Earth base, then died when Earth attacked them in retaliation.<br />The author has some unique theories on various subjects, which he explores via a science fiction novel. Among other things, he talks about a one-world government, religion, evolution and cosmology (he asserts that the Big Bang Theory of universe creation is wrong). Read this book for those theories, don't read it for the quality of the fiction.	2000-12-19

One day, while Margaret, his mother, is being beaten up by Rick, the bordello owner, Hastings takes out a pistol and kills him. While still a teenager, Hastings takes over the bordello, and is siccessful for a while, until he is arrested and sent to juvenile prison, where he is killed in a fight with other inmates.<br />Hastings finds himself in Hell, face to face with Satan. Edward learns many things, including how to manipulate electricity and change his appearance at will. Satan's intention is to send him back to earth on a mission to create as much pain, death and chaos as possible. He keeps a journal, written in a Latin dialect and filled with astrological charts, of his past and future activities.<br />It falls into the hands of Tericita Ellis, a Caribbean-American professional astrologer in present-day New York City. Along with Aaron Jacobs, her new husband, Ellis deciphers the journal. They flee the city just before a Hastings-caused disaster hits the city when they realize that Hastings will stop at nothing to retrieve the journal. If Satan finds out that the journal is missing, he will be most displeased.<br />For a first novel, this is sufficiently weird and creepy and very good. Some may question the prominent place given to astrology in this story, but that shouldn't take away from a novel that is very much worth reading.	2000-10-22

This group of essays explores his travels and the people he has met along the way.<br />In the post-war era, San Francisco may have been the center of bohemian living, but Los Angeles had quite a thriving bohemian community of its own. His leftist political leanings got him blacklisted by the California Newspaper Association. Rolfe was the only member of the Menuhin family (the virtuoso violinist Yehudi Menuhin was an uncle) to actually work for a living; his politics also got him cut out of the family will. He explores the joys, and heartbreaks, of owning six cockatiels. His parents divorced when his mother wanted to live in London and continue her music career; Rolfe's father, a worker's compensation attorney, didn't want her to tour, even some of the time. He talks about an emergency trip to Los Angeles Community Hospital. It's a rather old teaching hospital that may not be state-of-the-art in all things, but, Rolfe found it to be full of conscientious doctors and nurses (not something that every hospital can boast), and it survived the 1994 Northridge earthquake, when many other newer buildings collapsed.<br />I really enjoyed this book. It isn't just a heartfelt autobiography in essay form, or a history of modern California as seen from the underside of society; it's more than that. This one is well worth reading.	2000-10-18

They are a family who move very easily between the realms  of the normal and everyday to the strange and fantastic. The Von Bek's seem  to have done it all, including standing at the gates of Heaven and Hell.  These tales, which span the twentieth century, are about people looking for  some kind of fulfillment in their lives, a Holy Grail. A roadie drives  around late 1960s England with a reincarnated Jimi Hendrix, who is not yet  ready to reveal himself in public. Another story involves North Africa and  a piece of human skin sent through the mail with a full color tattoo of a  Tarot card, the Wheel of Fortune, on it. In Depression-era London, the  vicar of a shabby London parish suddenly becomes an urgent orator and  proselytizer. Saying things of which the Church does not approve, he is  branded the Clapham Antichrist. He becomes a sort of traveling preacher  after being defrocked as a priest, and after the war, becomes a regular on  TV intellectual shows, after which he disappears from public life. In  present-day Aswan, Egypt, a man goes to rescue his archaeologist sister,  whose letters home got increasingly strange. Depending on who he talks to,  she has become either a junior Mother Teresa or a member of a UFO cult. The  truth is actually much more fantastic.

This book gives some of the  answers.<br />During the Irish Potato Famine, two million people died of  starvation, but Ireland actually had twice as much food as was needed to  feed its population. Irish peasants were told by the person who actually  owned the land that Paying Rent Comes First (even before feeding their  children). The practice still goes on today around the  world.<br />International aid programs simply push population control (and  dump unsafe contraceptives) on the Third World, instead of changing the  conditions that require many children.<br />It's been said that for people who  want to become politically active, food is the perfect place to start,  because it affects everyone. Reading this book is an excellent way to start  that activism.	2000-07-31

A story set in rural England early in the  1900s has a wonderful title, &quot;The Adventure of the Crawling  Horror.&quot; What looks like a grandfather clock with four hands, and  strange symbols where the numbers should be, actually has a much more  hellish purpose. Another story has to do with John Wayne supposedly being  buried in a pink dress. Kim Newman contributes a multi-part short novel  about a fist-sized ruby with the power to destroy mankind. <br />I am not much  of a mystery or supernatural reader, but I really enjoyed these stories.  They work as detective stories, and the occult part is sufficiently  strange. This is well worth reading.	2000-07-29

Jonathan asks around in  Miami's homeless community about the man, a Cuban named Spider who came to  Miami in the Mariel Boatlift of the early 1980s. For his trouble, Jonathan  is found dead a few days later.<br />Avery Guerin, another MLA attorney, and  Jonathan's sometime lover, asks questions on her own. The story moves to  Key West as Avery and Stuart, her law school intern with whom she has a  rather torrid relationship, look for a homeless Nicaraguan who spoke to  Jonathan soon before his death. The Nicaraguan is actually a writer  researching a book on formerly successful people who fell through the  cracks during the Reagan/Bush years.<br />Suspicion falls on Alex, another MLA  attorney and Jonathan's mentor who is also a former member of the Florida  legislature. Without giving too much away, the story then shifts to the  courtroom.<br />This is an excellent legal mystery. It's got murder, intrigue,  sex, and Rockey, an attorney who practiced in Miami, does a very good job  at keeping the reader guessing until the end.	2000-07-29

The first group, looking for religious freedom, spent ten years in cold sleep before arriving on one of two planets  orbiting each other in the Ross 248 star system. They liked what they saw  on Nineveh, and sent word home for another group of colonists. The ship  carrying them was destroyed in a meteor storm in the Ross system, and the  sleep capsules were launched into space, mostly landing on Nimrud, the  second planet.  They built a society of sorts on the desolate, barren hunk  of rock, and after some years, asked to move to some unoccupied land on  Nineveh. The Ninevites said No over and over; eventually Nimrud went to war  over moving to Nimrud. Recurring every few years, the war has gone on for  over a century. That is the situation facing Goldenwing Glory, the last of  the great interstellar sailing ships. Sister to the ships that brought both  sets of colonists, it is delivering an equipment order placed 200 years  previously. Glory is aksed to be the venue for peace talks, but, of course,  both sides have other plans for the ship. Coppel does an excellent job wih  the society building in this novel, which is also a very good space opera.  It's not a very fast-moving story, but it is very much worth the read.	2000-07-27

One day, a frightened young woman comes in, asking if he's one of &quot;them,&quot; and if he's been &quot;awakened.&quot; Carr has no idea what she is talking about. A few  minutes later, a man sits at Carr's desk, pretending to smoke a cigarette,  and answering employment-type questions like he's talking to an invisible  person. One of Carr's colleagues suddenly starts ignoring him. His original  thought is that this is some kind of strange joke, He soon learns  differently.<br />The woman, Jane, tries to keep him out of it, but Carr  eventually learns that everyone has a &quot;pattern&quot; that they're  expected to follow throughout life. As long as a person stays in their  pattern, everything is fine. When a person does omething unexpected, or  otherwise goes out of their pattern, it's like they aren't just invisible,  they suddenly don't exist, until they return to their pattern. In other  words, the universe is a giant machine.<br />I really enjoyed this book. It's  very thought provoking, and Leiber is a great author, so this is also very  well done. For something short, and very different, this is the book.	2000-07-27

This book does a very good at cutting through the fog and shedding some much needed light. One estimate says that environmental pollution contributes to about 25% of  today's medical problems. There are not enough primary care doctors, and  too many specialists, especially in rural areas and the inner city. Many  health care provider networks and insurance companies try to discourage  those with major (expensive) medical problems from joining. In countries  with national health insurance, like Canada, Britain and France the amount  of GNP spent on health care stays the same from year to year. In the US,  the percentage of GNP going to health care rises by 20% per year. Between  1970 and 1982, the number of health care providers rose by 57%, while the  number of administrators shoed a 171% increase. Less than one half of one  percent of the national health budget is spent on preventive measures like  prenatal care and reducing environmental toxins from industry. This is a  short book, but it really shows the current state of American health care.  This subject affects everyone at one time or another, so this book is  highly recommended for everyone.	2000-07-27
US	50455329	RUADD1EGZS6KW	0425071049	413854961	The Hanging Stones	Books	4	30	30	N	N	Excellent Appalachian wizardry	Millionaire industrialist Noel Kottler has plans to recreate Stonehenge, as it was several thousand years ago, on the top of Teatray Mountain and turn it into an amusement park. He also plans to hire Silver John,  half-troubadour, half-expert on local folklore, to sing for the tourists.  John doesn't care much for city folk like Kottler or for the whole theme  park idea. The local wolf spirits are also not happy with the invasion of  their mountain. John is a real threat to them, so his wife Evadare is  kidnapped, and her release depends on him leaving Teatray Mountain. Once he  is gone, scaring away the rest of the construction workers from the new  Stonehenge will be easy. John is assisted by Esdras Hogue and Judge Keith  Pursuivant, two others who know their way around the worlds of spirits and  folklore. He goes off alone to find Evadare, and gets help from a very  unexpected source.  Appalachian wizardry is not exactly a well-traveled  area in the fantasy world. Wellman does an excellent job of storytelling.  It's interesting, plausible, and well done with just enough of an  undercurrent of weird. Two strong thumbs up.	2000-07-26

In this world, witchcraft works, and  the talent is passed from mother to daughter at the moment the daughter is  no longer a virgin. The daughter's lover takes possession of a five-pointed  talisman from the young witch, the blue star, and with it can read the true  thoughts of anyone by looking into their eyes. Rodvard is an ineffectual  clerk in the government geneaological offices. He becomes part of a secret  organization called Sons of the New Day, who want to destroy the whole  corrupt Empire and build a totally new system. He is pushed into seducing a  virgin witch named Lalette, so he can use her Blue Star to enhance their  political schemes. Neither of them really care for the other. The whole  affair quickly goes wrong, and they are both forced to flee an empire that  barely tolerates witchcraft. This is a quiet story, though not without its  moments of adventure. It will take some effort on the part of the reader,  but it is very much worth it.	2000-07-23

While he was jailed, his girlfriend died in a mysterious epidemic. She isn't really dead; she's been brought  back to life, and her body is being used as a test bed for an artificail  brain. He kidnaps the creature with his girlfriend's body from the research  center where it is being monitored, and they live together sort of happily  while society collapses around them. One night, they are arrested by the  police, but not for the usual reasons. The whales of the world have learned  how to communicate with man, and have told the governments of the world to  put those two on a small boat on a southwest course into the Atlantic-Or  Else. The animals of the world have started to fight back against man, led  by the whales, who have learned how to mess with earth's climate. This  Brave-New-Worldish novel is interesting, strange, and very easy to read.  Except for a feeling that the novel ended before the story did (sequel?),  this one is very much worth checking out.	2000-07-23

Van Vogt	Books	5	18	19	N	N	Excellent collection by a Master	This is a group of lesser-known science fiction stories, first published between the 1940s and 1960s, by one of the all-time masters of the field. When writers like Asimov and Heinlein were hitting their stride, van Vogt  was the pinnacle to which they aspired. When the first specialty book  publishers were looking for material to republish after World War II, van  Vogt was their first stop.     In this book, the last survivor of a  spaceship that crash landed on Mars finds a deserted Martian village.  Natives of the Andes Mountains are able to survive in the thin atmosphere  of Mars, without pressure suits, to the great resentment of those born at  sea level. A human and an ezwal, a large, blue, three-eyed being with the  power of telepathic communication, crash land on a jungle planet and are  forced to cooperate with each other to survive. This is despite the fact  that the ezwal hates humans and would just as soon tear the human into  little pieces.   These may not be classic, well-known stories, but they  still run rings around most of what was, and is, in the science fiction  section of the local chain bookstore.	2000-07-12
