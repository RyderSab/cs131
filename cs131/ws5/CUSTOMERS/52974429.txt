Ms. Sims can't write fast enough to feed her hungry audience, but when she serves up delicious stories like \\"Waiting For You,\\" we come away sated and this time a little buzzed on wine.  [I still have a sappy grin on my face after imbibing on this story]. <br /> <br />We learn so much from a Janice Sims' novel and this time it is the wine industry.  That's why her novels appeal to so many.  She always takes us to a new level of knowledge and interest.  Her characters come to life and teach us at the same time.  Like her stories, Janise Sims is a wine expert; not a 40 oz. novelist like some others who write in this genre. <br /> <br />I just wish she could write faster . . .	2005-04-11

This is one of those times when it was money and time I did not regret spending.  Karyn Langhorne wrote an interesting story [not as good as Sandra Kitt's \\"The Color of Love\\" or Kim McLarin's \\"Meeting of the Waters\\"]yet it kept me reading until I finished it in one day.  I could believe the character flaws in Alayna Jackson and why she developed them.  What didn't quite get me to the 5-star range was Ben Richards and Alayna.  Why did he fall in love with her and in two months?  We didn't learn much about his chemistry.  Almost everything was viewed from Alayna's perspective.  What got me to the 4-star range was the precision and story structure.  I enjoy reading a story that's well constructed and entertaining.  Of course I am ready to see the end of the Round da way Sistah: Hand on hip, neck snakin', fickle finger in da face, readin' somebody out!  Please!  No more of that drama queen sterotype.  The twenty-first century sistah doesn't need it.  She's matured along with her professional persona.  THANK GOODNESS!  The real test: Would I buy or read it again?	2005-04-11

Nora Roberts simply does not know how to write a bad novel and even though this one went more than 500 pages, as far as I'm concerned, she could have doubled it.  What was unique about Northern Lights was that the love story was second to the love of the scenery.  I've never been to Alaska, but after Northern Lights, I really want to go.  I could feel that bone deep chill or see the four feet of new snow.  Just as she has done in her other novels \\"The Villa,\\" or \\"Midnight Bayou,\\" Ms. Roberts sucks you right into each scene.<br /><br />As for the \\"lovers,\\" Meg had fewer flaws than some of her other female characters.  She's a strong, independent woman who can truly take men or leave them.  Initially, it seemed that Meg pitied Nate.  He certainly was a pitiable soul.<br /><br />And if there were two things that dropped this review from a 5 to a 4 star, it is based on two things:  (1) I still felt sorry for Nate even when the book regrettably ended and (2)as others have commented, the love affair grew a little too quickly.<br /><br />Will I invest in another Nora Robb book?

After the third reading, I confess that I will never be a recovering Sims' novel junkie.<br />Of course, her work always has an excellent plot, other characters to keep us entertained, mystery to keep us on the edge, romance to make us swoon, twists and unexpected turns to keep us guessing, all hallmarks of a great Sims novel; but what puts the cherry on this icing (please pardon the pun, I really couldn't help myself)is how a man and woman LOVE each other.

I don't know what's going on at Arabesque, but they are certainly turning out some great novels and introducing us to some exciting novelists.  Celeste Norfleet's &quot;Since Forever&quot; steps boldly out of the usual mold for romance novels and takes us on an exciting journey with characters that we can care about.  Every one of her characters lives in the pages of this book and captures their audiences' attention.  Much like a Janice Sims' novel.<BR>All three of Ms. Norfleet's novels captivated me from the very beginning.  She gives her readers much, much more than the run-of-the-mill romance.  She even spiced up &quot;Since Forever&quot; with believable class, exciting locations and unique drama.  I thoroughly enjoy her writing style and character development.  Ms. Norfleet is an extraordinarily talented writer.  If you haven't added her novels to your library, you're missing out on some great reading.<BR>I look forward to not only her next romances, &quot;One Sure Thing&quot; and &quot;Reflections Of You,&quot; but also her entry into the next level, hardbacks.

Her stories engender skill one would expect from a veteran craftperson such as Nora Roberts with acres of novels to her credit.  The most recent in the Grayson trilogy, &quot;Power of Persuasion&quot; is a blockbusting success riding on the highly touted first two novels and again gleefully breaking the barriers of the routine romance genre.<br />     A.J. Grayson is truly believable as the 20-something-year-old computer geek PhD whose science and computer knowledge has developed an artificial intelligence system which may predict events as intriging as espionage and military operations.  Recruited to use her system &quot;Poppet&quot; for something other than predicting consumer trends and product acceptance for the Grayson conglomerate, she is tasked by a US government espionage agency to help protect the newly enstalled king of Jafir, Damon Toca.  The new king is anything but happy about the mantle that has been layed on his reluctant shoulders, but he tries to cope with his new and totally unexpected status with the help of the facinating A.J. Grayson.  Mysteries and intrigue surround and abounds making for one of the most interesting and entertaining novels I've read this year . . . and the intimate interludes will have your toes curling!!<br />I truly look forward to Ms. Montgomery's next novel . . . hopefully in mainstream fiction with the length of the story equal to &quot;The Emperor of Ocean Park&quot; or &quot;War and Peace&quot; in the bedroom!!

Robb novel is the author's extraordinary wit and sense of humor.  Her comedic timing and spacing of these oratory gems are impeccable and enjoyable.  The repartee between Eve Dallas and her aide, Officer Peabody, often makes you laugh out loud.  And then there is that dry humor between Eve and Roark that seems so much a natural part of their relationship that, from the very opening lines of any of her \\"In Death\\" novels, you're held in a state of suspended animation waiting until the very first scene between the couple unfolds.  That is, of course, until Ms. Robb takes Eve and Roark on one of their erotic journeys.  Nothing to laugh about there; just enjoy the ride.  (You may want to read or reread her \\"Midnight Bayou\\" novel for some excellent examples of her comedic talents.)<br />I'm sure that we can all pick out special scenes and situations in Ms. Robb's novels that are memorable, but in \\"Purity\\" the most hilarious (in my view) involved Mavis' announcement to Eve that she's pregnant.  Poor Eve (and it's hard to think of Eve as being poor in any sense) has no clue what to do with her emotions even as she tried with difficulty to tell Roark and Dr. Mira about Mavis.  We will all likely be in stitches when the stork finally visits Eve and Roark.  Though I thoroughly enjoy Robb/Roberts as a seriously \\"mag\\" literary talent, that \\"In Death\\" episode when Eve finally becomes pregnate will fly off every global best seller list.  Let's hope that it comes soon.	2002-08-27

Now that Janice Sims has made us feel like we personally visited Ethiopia, we can set our sights on some other country in African to visit.  What a wonderful historical journey and travelogue!!!  Just as novelist Beverly Jenkins focuses on recent history of Africans in the Americas, Janice Sims takes us back to our roots in the Motherland, with an entree to Haiti at the end of the story.  There is so much of our history that we do not know, but she made it very real and easy to follow.  (I admit that I was annoyed when Solange cut the trip short and decided not to visit other areas of the country!)  Of particular note is the blending of her storyline with biblical history and mythology.  I recognize that Ms. Sims obviously did a lot of research.  She really worked the history, mythology and religion into the storyline extremely well.<br />\\"For Your Love\\" is vintage Janice Sims.  Her characters are always interesting and we can always count on her for an intriguing storyline.  She never lets her readers down by serving us shopworn pap, recycled cliches or dull intimacy.  Of course we know that the main characters are going to get together in the end, but she never makes that road too easy for us to navigate.  Surprises abound.  That's why we can not put one of Ms. Sims' novels down until we reach the end.  This time she left us hanging through.  Solange touched the fertility goddess, the condom broke and . . . and . . .?<br />Come on, Ms. Sims, why you wanna leave a sistah hangin' line that for, huh?  Would a little morning sickness have hurt somewhere near the end of the story, in the epilogue maybe?  Oh, no, not our Janice-leave-us-out-there-turning-slowly-in-the-wind-until-the-next-novel-Sims!!  Okay, where are we going next on our romantic journey, huh?  Could it be a red hot illicit affair of the older kind between Marie DuPree and Theophilus Gault or is it time for Samantha Gault to grow up and get busy?

Evelyn Palfrey's \\"Everything in Its Place!\\"  This is another sterling novel from the queen of the \\"marvelously mature\\" literary ranks.  As an author, Ms. Palfrey takes seconds to no one who writes in this middle-age genre.  She beautifully captures the nature, concerns and strengths of the new millennium grandparent; savvy due to experience, aware of future challenges and the wisdom to know and blend the differences.<br />Although life hasn't been a crystal stair for Barbara (Bobbie) Strickland, she is still the epitome of the superwomen in today's society.  She's competent professionally and personally, self confident and passionate about her family and friends.  While still traveling life's rough roads Bobbie is challenged yet again with her twenty-five-year-old daughter's inability to persevere as an adult and mother; her granddaughter's preteen angst; her dedication to serve her community; and her insecurities about intimacy where men are concerned at her stage in life.<br />Enter Raymond Caldwell (Lt.

Usually, we either see the before or the after, but Ms. Schuster treats us to \\"during\\" or as one poet puts it so astutely, the dash, the place between here and there. Melanie Schuster really deserves rave reviews for this one!! <br />Both Andrea Benita Cochran and Clayton Arlington Deveraux are members of big families, unusually tall and statuesque, and the eldest of their siblings.  Both are heading large communications companies, but in different parts of the industry and in different states.  We get to meet and enjoy their friends and their relatives who add another new and interesting dimension to the typical story and lay the ground work extremely well for a series of romantic journeys for the family and friends of the Cochran/Deveraux dynasties.  But Benita Cochran is my kind of woman!!  She's strong, assertive, with high self esteem, an incredibly lovable mother wit, and a kick-ass attitude.  I really enjoy reading female characters that aren't filled with inane phobias and tons of emotional baggage--the I-can't-be-myself-because-of-fifty-gazillion-bits-of-nonsense.  Or cooing and simpering like nitwits.  She sees Clay and captures him; no brag, just fact!!  They both weather tragedy in their young relationship and marriage, but come out on the other side of the devestation better people for having had the experience.  <br />Melanie Schuster is going on my list of favorite authors.  I love her writing style.  She doesn't let the wordsmith in her get in the way of telling the good story.  In short, she see the individual trees, not just the forest.  I can't wait for Renee's and Andrew's story; Benita's best friend and her twin brother, respectively.  The May-December aspect with Renee's story is a really new perspective (at least for me) and promises to be just as entertaining.  I hope that Arabesque lets her explore all of the nuances with the tug-of-war between dating an older man verses dating the traditional younger one, Andrew.  We know how it's going to end, but getting there promises to take us on a different type of romantic journey (i.e., what can an older man do for her that Andrew is going to have to overcome).  Absolutely intriguing!!	2002-07-26

Eric Dickey always takes us in a different direction than most writers, yet he keeps us grounded in reality.  He even keeps us off balance by writing novels that don't resemble each other in any shape, form or fashion.  Who have you read lately who tells the story of a bodyguard's life and makes you enjoy it?  Dickey's \\"got jokes\\" galore and snappy jargon.  Always expect Dickey to be unique.  Now he's telling the story of a thinking bodyguard/hustler and we can even like this con artist without thinking about the stereotypical muscleman image that characters such as this usually conjures up.  That's because Dickey catches us before we start those preconceived notions and tells us the heart wrenching story of Dante Black's adolescent trauma.<br />And who else have you read lately (male or female) who can write... (not love) scenes that makes you sweat!  I've read all of the major male African American fiction authors, but nobody and I do mean nobody can whip it on you like Eric Dickey.  Just ask Pam (Dante's love interest/... actress/partner in crime) who is much older than Dante, but admits that even with her experience with men she can't keep up with Dante's 25-year-old sex feasts.  Many women would die tryin'!!<br />The other cast of characters become someone you've met before but can't remember where.  They are just that familiar and comfortable, but don't let me convince you.  Just read the first chapter and then try to put the book back on the shelf.  Betcha can't read just one!	2002-06-12

She has done so with honesty and insight.  Of course, our protaganists are both imperfect members of the human race who are trying to get through life with the least amount of acrimony.  Nevertheless, they invite reprocussions by crossing the color barrier to date each other and even become engaged to be married.  And Ms. McLarin doesn't let them off easy.  She explores and exposes every racial sterotype and theory from a historical as well as current day prospective.  Only one other author that I've read, Sandra Kitt, in her novel, &quot;The Color of Love,&quot; has succeeded in treating the subject of interracial dating with sensitivity and courage.

All excellent mystery writers. However, Christopher Chambers has written not just a mystery, but a true thriller and an excellent, yet complex, read. <br />Sympathy for the Devil is a white-knuckle, edge-of-your-seat, tightly written romp through the true Washington, DC, elite and underworld dens. Chambers flavors his knowledge of FBI procedure and hierarcy in the city with taste and appreciation for every other element (beyond the federal and city governments) that the Nation's Capitol has to offer. Chambers'insight is to Washington, DC, what Grace Edwards is to Harlem, New York. Beyond the rich texture, Chambers keeps us hanging by our collective finger nails through chapter by chapter trying to get a grip on the many twists and turns and then cold-cocks us with his finale.

Skinner's work is always well written, has interesting story lines, and has believable characters.  However, unlike Skinner's previous novels in this series, our hero, Wesley Farrell isn't as prominately displayed this time around.  Completely absent is his paramour, Savanna, a black club owner with a voice as rich as the delta.  Rather, this time around Marcel Aristide, Wesley's cousin, makes a return appearence and steps to the forefront to follow in his sleuthing relative's footsteps.<br />It certainly wasn't unusual for a light-skinned black man to pass himself off as a white man in the New Orleans of the 1930's and 1940's.  Farrell is such a man and cunningly dangerous to boot, but he doesn't disregard his black heritage or disrepect his white father, an Irishman and Chief of Detectives, Frank Casey.  Most father's would regret having a son who has been an unconvicted career criminal, but Frank Casey's life has been saved and his career enhansed because his son knows the wrong side of the law as well as his father knows the right side.<br />Add to the complex story line the flavor of New Orleans, the taste of danger, a bit of intrigue, a wealth of racial mix and you have one of the most entertaining mysterys around.  For other flavorful African American mysteries in New Orleans, try Barbara Hambly's Ben January series and James Sallis' Lew Griffin series.	2001-11-02

I've read all of Ms. Sims' other novels and get a thrill each time she issues up another evening of pure enjoyment.  Such is the case with &quot;This Time Forever.&quot;  Ms. Sims' characters are &quot;adults&quot; with all pretenses striped away.  That is what makes her novels stand out amoung the crowd of authors.  Her characters don't simper and coo their way into each other's lives.  Rather they march to a different drummer, heads up, shoulders back and take-no-prisoners attitudes.  At the same time, the chemistry between her characters is like molten lava.  The women aren't shy and retiring and the men don't have to beat their chests to be seen as men.  If you're interested in reading about African American characters who are more than one dimentional, have interesting perspectives and are people you would really like to know, pick up any novel by Janice Sims.  She doesn't know how to write an uninteresting novel.	2001-10-10

I enjoyed this book because the African American female character, Nikki Hill, is strong, independent and intellegent.  So few novels offer up African American characters who challenge the intellect while not making clowns of themselves. Other top-notch serial mystery authors (with interesting African American female characters) who deserve attention include Eleanor Taylor Bland (The Marti MacCallister Mysteries), Grace F. Edwards (The Mali Anderson Mysteries), Penny Mickelbury (The Carol Ann Gibson Mysteries)and Paula L. Woods (The Charlotte Justice Mysteries).

Norman Kelley has something to say about politics in the good ole US of A and his protagonist, Nina Halligan, is the right vessel through which to make his points. The novel is well written and the characters are believable. Kelley's ability to blend present day government corruption and fantasy raises the phrase &quot;life is truer than fiction&quot; to an art form. The only reason this didn't get a 5-star rating from me concerns the rather inconsistent ending. A little too heavy on the mystical when it really wasn't necessary.

Tell everyone that you're going away for the day and can't be reached. Get into comfortable clothes. Find a comfortable spot with comfort food within an arm's reach. Open Stormy Weather reverently and begin to read . . .

Althought Sandra Kitt is a prolific writer, she only releases approximately one book per year.  When she does, though, it's always a best seller.  No one has to guess why that's true.  Strong writing, characters that we care about, and unique situations. Her novels are always well researched and well written.  Her characters are people we all want to know and enjoy.

How incredible a talent Roberts has for making us taste the grapes, feel the sun on our faces and making us worry over the frost.  Ms. Roberts gives us strong, independent women from three generations as yardsticks while making each woman unique in her own way.  Moreover, it is hard to find men who are not intimidated by their soul mates in any generation.  Nora Roberts makes us think that the men in her novel are the rule rather than the exception.  This novel is pure entertainment of the highest order.  Bravo, Ms. Roberts!!	2001-04-24

Pelecanos book that I've read, but it won't be the last.  Like most gifted writers, Pelecanos writes rich-bodied characters with all of their phallacies and strengths.  However, what sets Pelecanos apart from the others is his ability to capture the time and the place so successfully.  Gary Phillips, author of the Ivan Monk Mysteries, which are set in Los Angeles, and Grace Edwards, author of Mali Anderson Mysteries, set in Harlem, New York, have similiar gifts for capturing the essense of the era in the black community. Washington, DC, in the mid-1980's is no easy read.  A city where the mayor and those close to him were convicted of crimes while congress sat less than a mile away issuing edicts and strangling the eagle until it screamed and caused the city's infrastructure to fail.  On a philosophical level, Pelecanos is on target with the sermons that he sometimes delivers through his characters, but he fails to go far enough.  Washington, D. C. was in the 80s and is today the last working plantation.	2001-04-24

Parrish's first book, &quot;Dark of the Moon.&quot;  With some authors it is difficult to follow a best seller with another one.  No problem for P. J. Parrish.  Dead of Winter continues the story of Louis Kincaid, a man who (although he has a strong academic backgound and other career choices) wants to continue his career in law enforcement as a cop.  Go figure!  Nevertheless, he brings to the job a deep sense of honor and integrity in the failed hope of finding those same traits amoung his fellow officers.  Coupled with his mixed heritage, Kincaid quickly gets our support to keep trying and not give up on society or himself.  Well, this is one Louis Kincaid fan who has no intention of giving up on the fictional character or the excellent writer, P. J. Parrish.	2001-01-25

That is the case with her newest offering &quot;A Second Chance at Love.&quot;<br />As usual, you can't put a Janice Sims book down until you finish reading every last word.  With a wonderful blend of mystery, romance, suspense and even foreign intrigue, Ms. Sims manages to tell not just one story or even two.  No, she takes no prisoners when she offers us six different novels covering three generations within 282 pages.  First we have the story of Toni Shaw and Charles Waters, the fifty-something parents of twin daughters, Brianna and Georgette.  We first met Georgette in &quot;All the Right Reasons&quot; and now we get a wonderful update on  her and her husband Clayton Knight.  The third romance is between Brianna and Dominic Solomon.  Forth, we have Toni's parents, who, after more than fifty years together, prove the theory that seventy is still sexy.  Yusef and Salah Makonnen are the fifth romantic couple.  Bringing up the rear is the budding romance between Dr. Solange DuPree and the very British Rupert Giles.  Whew! And you didn't need a score card to keep up with all of the players.  Now that's what I call a writer!!	2001-01-16

Although you don't need to read Scandalous to understand what's going on in &quot;A Scandalous Affair&quot;, you'll want to kick yourself if you don't submerge yourself in Donna Hill's erotic love scenes.  Ms. Hill artfully revisits the lead characters from &quot;Scandalous,&quot; Attorney Justin Montgomery and his wife, Congresswoman Vaughn Hamilton-Montgomery, in A Scandalous Affair.  However, the new story focuses on their daughters who both fall for the same man.  Is that a plot or what?! Never fear, Ms. Hill is a writer extraordernaire.  She treats her topic with respect and maturity while at the same time riviting you to each page.  Delicious!	2000-12-07

If you have not read Grace Edwards before, you need to run (don't walk) to your favorite book store and plunk down what ever it takes to obtain the entire series of Mali Anderson mysteries. Mali Anderson is a former NYPD cop who sued the city and won an unlawful dismissal suit. That tells you something about this strong black woman's character. She's a devoted daughter to her musician father, a nurturing aunt to her orphaned teenage nephew, a fierce protector of her friends, and a loyal friend and lover to her man, Tad (a NYPD detective). And that's just the easy stuff!<br />Ms. Edwards rich knowledge of New York's Harlem (historical and current) and the greats in jazz make this series a virtual escapade of memorable sights and sounds. If you enjoy Charlotte Carter's Nanette Hayes Mystery series (including \\"Rhode Island Red,\\" \\"Coq Au Vin,\\" and \\"Drumsticks\\"), you'll thoroughly enjoy Mali Anderson and the other vivid characters that Ms. Edwards' magic pen creates.	2000-08-30

I agree with the  other reviews: great characters, suspensefull, clever, and extremely hard  to put down.  These characters would be great in a series, but Chassie West  keeps her mystery junkies waiting entirely too long between book fixes.  So  begging and pleading for a series is probably an exercise in futility.  I  just hope that we get another dose of this excellent writer sometime in the  foreseeable future!	2000-08-10

But, (and there is aways a but . . .) Nelson George leaves us hanging! How? This is a story about a 33-year-old businessman who has an epithay as best man at his best friend's wedding. The experience is so surreal that our hero begins to take stock of his own life and his loves and decides that maybe it's time to settle down and find a wife. He makes a list of the 133 women he has been with and determines that 3 women from his past(for various reasons) are the ones that he should focus on. Pressure is also brought to bear on our hero by his older sister, elderly mother, one of his nieces and a host of others hell bent on getting our hero to the altar as quickly as possible. We get to the end of the book and we know who the last woman is that our hero is with, but the last chapter doesn't get him (or us) to the altar! We presume that the woman he is last with the THE ONE, but we have no gurantee! (Frankly, I liked our hero single. I'm a woman who has been married for nearly 30 years and have a son and a daugter who both my husband and I encourage to see the world and date often and continuously. Who says everyone has to marry? It wasn't one of the Ten Commandment, was it? ) In any event, ONE WOMAN SHORT is a great read just as Nelson George's other novels, SEDUCED (1997) and URBAN ROMANCE (1999) were. Mr. George is an excellent writer. If you enjoyed WAITING IN VAIN by Colin Channer and/or UNTIL by Timmothy B. McCann, you're going to love ONE WOMAN SHORT (even though Mr. George left out the last chapter! . . . or maybe there's a sequel in the works . . . you think? Be still my heart!)	2000-07-24

I hope that he settles the question in the new novel of what happened to  his nieces (Corrie's and Delton's daughters).  As the story ended in Rock  and a Hard Place, his characters Laura Anne &amp; Barrett Raines, were  sitting on Fort Walton Beach with their twin sons after the death of  Barrett's brother Delton and sister-in-law Corrie, but no mention is made  of the orphaned children.	2000-06-08

This time Hugh Holton gives us an excellent story that is both believable and entertaining.  This is Holton going with his strengths -- solid characters, great police procedures and enveloping mystery.  It doesn't get  much better than this unless you're also a fan of Eleanor Taylor Bland's  Marti McAllister Mysteries (which apparently Holton is since he mentions  her in his acknowledgments).  However, unlike the McAllister police  character, Holton's Chief of Detectives Larry Cole is still one  dimensional.  He sacrificed his wife and son for his career and ends up  becoming a stud puppy for two very deranged sisters whose plot (despite his  super-cop instincts) Cole fails to recognize.  Go figure.  Nevertheless,  Time of the Assassins is a far better effort structurally than Holton's Red  Lightning, Left Hand of God or Presumed Dead.  The high-quality work which  brought Holton and his cop character, Larry Cole, to national prominence,  Chicago Blues, is evident in Time of the Assassins.  Bravo, Mr. Holton,  Bravo!	2000-06-06
US	52974429	RS3BSGFTBPKYB	1583140840	393756427	A Bittersweet Love	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Making romance real	What a wonderful novel!  I've enjoyed Ms. Sims' other novels, but this, in my view, is one of her very best.  In A Bittersweet Love, Ms. Sims permits her characters to develop independently, incorporated other sub-story lines  that are all too often absent from the run-of-the-mill romance novel.  Her  characters were developed as &quot;whole people&quot; long before they  actually met.  They were not neurotic or emotionally handicapped; they said  what they felt and dealt with each other as typical adults would (such a  wonderful change from the ordinary).  Also, with romance novels, we readers  expect that all will end well (love conquers all) with the main two  characters so that the mystery is always absent.  We know how the book is  going to end, but in the case of Bittersweet, Ms. Sims intrigued us with  divergent subcharacters that we were still guessing about until the very  end of the story.  That was another very refreshing change.  These factors  made her book much more interesting and enjoyable.  I hope that more of  this style of story line --  characters without exaggerated neuroses --  will be forthcoming from other romance writers.  Ms. Sims has already shown  how it's done.	2000-03-28

It is truly wonderful to be pleasantly surprised by the writing quality of a relatively unknown fiction writer.  Certainly, Christopher Darden is not unknown as a lawyer, but teamed with Dick Lochte (who I had never read  before), this book was well worth the time and money that I spent on it.   The only reason I missed giving it a 5-star rating is because most men  don't truly know women.  Darden and Lochte prove the point in their lack of  insight into a woman's world.  Nevertheless, I look forward to more from  this duo.	1999-09-17

I was spoiled by Mr. Holton's Windy City  and Chicago Blues, both fine works, but &quot;Red&quot; does not carry on  in the fine Holton tradition that one would expect.  The writing wasn't  nearly as crisp as in past books and the story line was predictable and  boring.  What's more, our hero, Chief of Detectives has divorced his wife,  his son is now fatherless, another family bites the dust because it's more  important to be super &quot;Chief&quot; than super family man.  Now super  stud is running after skirts.  I'm not impressed.  And what happened to the  other characters that we've come to enjoy?  They barely made an appearance.   How sad.	1998-09-15
