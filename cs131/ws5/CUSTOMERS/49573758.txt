Maybe if I had read the book high on acid it would have made some sort of sense, as it was I read it sober and found it at the least boring and at most highly offensive on a religious level as well as insulting on an intelectual level. Perhaps the authors should consider as their next work a study of how the nursery rhyme &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; is in reality proof that Einstien was really an alien offspring of E.T.s who crashed on Earth after they flew through the Bermuda Triangle, accidentally sank the Titanic before eventually crashing in Roswell, New Mexico.	2004-04-07

Well written, researched and crafted, Olsen weaves a tale that will pull the reader into a world (thank God) most of us will never see. I don't want to give away any surprises but I will say that in the end I began to wonder if its possible that some people are born without a soul much less a conscience. Go ahead, buy it and read it, I highly recommend it, but be prepared this Amish tale aint about quilts and growing corn.	2003-09-22

It's classic Seuss storytelling with outstanding illustrations that young children will love and boys and girls alike will instantly conect with the book's theme, \\"a person's a person, no matter how small.\\" A wonderful classic no child's library should be without...what the heck, even adults can learn something from kindhearted Horton, buy a copy regardless of your age.	2002-09-15

Though it is the author's first time out he never claims to be a word craftsman creating beautiful and wonderous prose, it is after all a 'True Crime' book about murder in a small town. I suggest ignoring the harsh reviewers, Jones takes an even handed and sometimes even gentle approach to reveal the story behind the grisly and seemingly motiveless murder in a small Indiana town by the most unlikely perpetrators...All Star Jock High School kids. Jones not only gives the chilling details of the murder but manages to untangle the mystery behind the brutal crime as well as give the reader a glimpse into the lives of those involved. I think Jones has done a superb job of delivering a well-written and carefully investigated true-crime book, go ahead, buy it, read it, I don't think you'll be disappointed.	2002-09-08

Dennis McDougal delivers a true-crime page turner that I simply couldn't put down. Ignore the more negative reviews, the book is well written and superbly researched, painting a truly nightmarish picture of true evil. Randy Kraft is one of the worst serial killers in American history gaining his morbid title by sheer numbers alone with a body count of at least 65! It's a chilling read of continous torture, rape and murder that spans an entire decade. The most disturbing part of the book is what isn't written...why haven't we heard of Kraft before now?<br /> Everyone has heard of Gacey, Dahmer, Son of Sam, etc. but until this book I'd never heard of Kraft...the murder and torture of young women is considered by society as more fiendish because overall women are more easily accepted as helpless victims, while young men especially strong, masculine Marines can take care of themselves. Obviously Kraft proves that anyone can fall victim when evil stalks our streets.	2002-09-08

This gives me reason for concern, no one is ever right in every instance no matter how experienced. For instance the William Heirens case which he breezes through with broad strokes doesn't touch on any of the contridictions of this particular case and in the end he writes William off as guilty without ever looking into any other aspects of the crimes and the man who supposedly committed them. I've come to know Mr. Heirens personally and quite frankly Mr. Douglas' treatment of his case was an insult. I was even more disturbed by Douglas' quick defense of Patsy Ramsey (for pay) when everything about Patsy's behavior fits his 'murderer' profile to a &quot;T&quot;. I simply refuse to trust someone who believes they're incapable of being wrong.	2002-09-02

Nickerson's account has been lost for decades and reading Chase's account alone would be cheating yourself of a real treat since Nickerson is by far the better storyteller.	2002-08-21

For well over a century Owen Chase's story of the sinking of the whaleship Essex has been the only firsthand documented account. Now side by side with Chase's tale is fellow shipmate Thomas Nickerson's account of the sinking and trial of the Essex crew lost at sea. As is to be expected, the style of the period makes itself felt throughout via word choice, spelling, etc. but more so in Mr. Chase's recounting. The real gem in this volume is Nickerson's retelling of the tale from his point of view, in spite of the strange twists of phrase his warmth and humor show through. If you enjoyed Philbrick's &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; and want to delve a little deeper and explore some of his resources this is the perfect place to start.	2002-08-21

At times the changing from one person's perspective to another's and jarring leaps from one time frame to another makes for choppy reading. Also there are times when it becomes confusing as to who is thinking or speaking because of odd phrases and awkward word placement, otherwise it truly is a fine read. If you enjoy minute details and background you won't be disappointed with \\"Mockery of Justice\\" and in the end the authors more than prove that Dr. Sam Sheppard was railroaded by the police, coroner's office and by the Cleveland press of the 1950's. The author, who is also the son of Dr. Sheppard gives almost a blow by blow account of how he and others have uncovered decades old lies, cover-ups, rumors and ultimately the clues that point to the probable identity of the true killer who has gone unpunished for so long. If you like true crime and micro-detailing you'll enjoy this book and come away convinced of the wrongful conviction of an innocent man and the brutal murder of a young mother and wife and the unraveling of a 50 year old mystery.	2002-08-11

A violent plane crash in the Andes leaves a team of young Rugby players to battle, sub-zero temperatures, avalanches, the death of friends and loved ones, hopelessness and eventually starvation. Their will to survive brings them to a horrible choice few ever have to make; resort to canabilism or die a painful death by starvation. What makes their decision even more heartbreaking and terrible is the fact that most of the bodies they must eat to live are friends, teammates, and/or relatives. For nearly 80 days we live through the waking nightmare via Read's narrative suffering unimaginable physical and incomprehensible mental trials, but in the end it is oddly a tale of hope, faith, love and the ultimate sacrafice.	2002-08-04

Michael Capuzzo has done a spectacular job of writing a truly entertaining as well as informative account of the 1916 New Jersey series of shark attacks. These attacks were used by author Peter Benchley to base his bestseller &quot;Jaws&quot; from. While a fan of both Jaws the book and movie both pale in comparison to Capuzzo's real-life account, this is honestly one of the best books I've read in quite some time. As for the other reviewers who complained about the &quot;detail&quot; used in the book these are obviously readers who were looking for strict blood, guts and schlock...for that type of reading stick to the tabloids, for an honest page-turning good read buy this book!	2002-07-31

Obviously the author of this book, Alexander McKee gives the true account of the tragedy that inspired the painting. Though similar to another shipwreck story; &quot;In the Heart of the Sea,&quot; which deals with the wreck of the whaleship Essex &quot;The Wreck of the Medusa&quot; differs because the tragedy of the Medusa is entirely manmade. Through the actions of the cowardly captain and the obnoxiously snobbish Gov. Schmaltz hundreds of innocents are abandoned on a overcrowded, rickety raft with next to no provisions while Schmaltz and Capt. de Chaumareys row off in large well provisioned lifeboats....echoes of Titanic here. But even more disgusting is how these two sorry excuses for human beings continue to harrass the few destitute survivors long after the ordeal at sea ends. This story shows humanity at it's best and far beyond it's worst.	2002-07-30

The author Nathaniel Philbrick does an absolutely superb job narrating the tragic tale of the whaleship Essex; not only does he give you an up close view of the ordeal the stranded sailors went through but he also gives a detailed (and interesting) look into the whaling business as well as life on the island of Nantucket in the late 1800s. From beginning to end I was caught up in the story, it would be a true shame if &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; doesn't become a classic and the story of the Essex's crew becomes lost once more in the mists of time.	2002-07-30

Steve Thomas makes no bones about who he thinks killed poor JonBenet and he spells it out using the evidence as the book progresses. But the most appalling thing about the entire thing to me aside from the horrible murder itself is the \\"politically correct\\" District Attorney's office of Boulder Co. who sabotaged the case from the very beginning. The DA's office should be tried for abuse of office and power, Thomas' tale of political betrayal and backstabbing as the Boulder Police Dept. tried to bring a killer to justice is a crime in itself. More than one person got away with a crime on that Christmas night.	2002-05-11

Books	5	11	16	N	Y	An Innocent Boy Used By Chicago Police &amp; Press As Scapegoat	Dolores Kennedy has done a wonderful job researching the topic of William Heirens and the murders he (reluctantly) confessed to and was eventually charged and jailed for. Though it's been twelve years since its publication and newer evidence and experts have looked into Mr. Heirens case, their source for their findings began with the points Kennedy covers in this well written documentation. But more than the facts and fiction of this fascinating case the reader is introduced to a bright, caring, and brave man who grew from the frightened 17 year old charged with 3 notorious murders. After reading this book I immediately jumped at the chance to write the Governer of Illinois to lend my voice in the cry to free William Heirens after 56 years of inprisonment. This book is not your typical 'True Crime' book, instead it's a well crafted and powerful argument to give Mr. Heirens what he's never had...a fair trial. Buy this book, you won't be disappointed!	2002-04-30

This book was written by a young man looking back on his experiences, attitudes, beliefs, etc. when he was 18, give the guy a break. I personally found the book engrossing and very suspenseful as well as an intresting insight into the young driven mind of a motivated young man driven to prove himself. The Last Victim is an entertaining and interesting break from the usual true-crime books which tend to sound either sensational or read like a police report. Jason Moss has given us a truly unique and different perspective of the twisted souls that repel and draw us at the same instant into their dark worlds. A definite reccomended read!	2002-04-13

The accounts of the sailors and their ordeal of being lost at sea, battling sharks, thirst, hunger, one another and desperation is at once heartbreaking as well as uplifting. It's a true testament to the courage of the men who lived and those who died and the cowardice of the Navy brass who not only contributed to the sinking of Indianapolis but caused further loss of life due to incompetence ashore that delayed the rescue.<br />  The final injustice is brought against Captain McVay who is eventually court martialed by his peers. The story of these sailors and their Captain is nothing less than haunting and we can only hope the current leaders in the Navy have learned a lesson never to be repeated.	2002-01-06

Surprising because the first book I read by this author, &quot;Fatal Voyage&quot; was a superb telling of the sinking of the USS Indianapolis with much more body to the characters and their story, I was expecting the same with this telling of the devastation of San Francisco by quake and fire, but alas... Even so it's worth a read if you're interested in the city's history, the book serves honorably as an overview of this chapter in San Francisco's past, but if you're looking for gripping personal tales, it's just shake and bake basics.	2002-01-06

Sounds good until you realize that implanted at birth into the palm of every citizen is a life clock crystal that glows with a different color for each seven years of life.
