The story of this Crusade--from its conception in the mind of Pope Innocent III to its unlikeliest of outcomes--is so dissimilar from the others that one wonders if we are looking at another species of war altogether.<br /><br />By 1198 the term \\"crusading\\" had become a mentality, the use of armed force to dislodge infidels and unbelievers for spiritual gain, in a sense rather similar to the present day Islamic concept of jihad--with the unspoken assumption [by the troops, at any rate] that a crusader, under the right set of circumstances, could become quite rich should he survive the battle field. In the century since the First Crusade, a considerable body of expertise and tradition had developed on the subject. Crusading was becoming a family tradition and targets were becoming more numerous. By 1198 there had been three major and several minor crusades to recover the Holy Land, but other campaigns had targeted the Moors in Spain, for example. And, as Phillips observes, the custom of tournaments and jousts was fine-tuning the effectiveness of cavalry and foot soldiers alike.<br /><br />Innocent's global intent was a renewal of the European Church, of which recovery of the Holy Land, lost again in 1187, would rejuvenate and validate. What he did not understand fully was how the Third Crusade had disrupted western European politics. Monarchs who might have helped him before were too preoccupied solidifying their own positions. Innocent by default had to settle for second-tier leadership, so to speak, but this body would include a remarkable nobleman, Baldwin, and one Geoffrey of Villehardouin who would leave behind an insider's journal of inestimable historiographical worth.<br /><br />One major mistake made by this team was its first official act, and it would set in motion an unforeseen chain of events. Calculating that at least 35,500 troops would be necessary for the Crusade, and having learned from experience that sea passage was easier on fighting men, and that the destruction of Alexandria would be a necessary first step in the campaign, the leaders contracted with the only entity capable of producing that quantity of ships, Venice, and its remarkable 90 year-old Doge [leader] Dandolo. Venice in essence put its economy on hold for a year to build ships, in return for a commensurate payment from the Crusade [85,000 marks] when it was ready to depart Venice. To their dismay, Baldwin and his team would discover that only 12,000 men had been recruited and very little of the funding. In short, Venetian interest in recovering its debt would now have to be factored into the military plan.<br /><br />It was this set of circumstances that led Dandolo to recommend that Crusaders and Venetians combine military operations against Zara, a Christian city but a longtime Venetian competitor. The Crusaders and the Venetians successfully sacked the city, but still found themselves considerably short of funds. Wintering in Zara [1202-1203], the Crusaders learned that Innocent was so outraged that he threatened to excommunicate the entire lot, a move which would have effectively disbanded an army marching on the promise of a plenary indulgence.<br /><br />While a delegation from the Crusade went to Rome to soothe troubled waters, Prince Alexius of Constantinople approached the Crusade at Zara with a remarkable offer: if the Crusaders and Venetians [now one effective force] would divert to Constantinople and restore his father to the throne of the Eastern Empire, the Empire in turn would fund the Crusade to the Levant and submit to the Roman Church. Baldwin and Dandolo decided to take the chance. Baldwin, a layman, felt that the reunification of the two Christendoms would more than appease the pope for the shame of Zara. Dandolo, on the other hand, saw immense economic opportunities for Venice.<br /><br />And so it came to be that a Crusade once intended for Alexandria and Jerusalem proceeded in a diametrically opposite direction, north to the cradle of the Eastern Roman Empire. One can only imagine the persuasive powers of the Crusade's leaders in explaining all this to the soldiers, let alone the pope. Phillips observes, however, that in every crusade there comes a moment when a pope in essence loses control of events, and indeed the armada proceeding to the Golden Horn was such a moment for Innocent.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the Crusade discovered upon its arrival at Constantinople that Alexius could not deliver what he promised. Quite the opposite. The Crusade, at maximum 20,000 men, found itself at war with a city of 500,000 surrounded by perhaps the best fortifications in the world. Phillips' account of the battle for Constantinople is insightful and gripping. A combination of factors--the advanced naval techniques of the Venetian navy and the improved armor and technique of western knights, favorable weather, psychological stratagems, incredibly weak military and political will on the part of the Empire itself--led to one of history's most stunning military upsets.<br /><br />But no one, not even the author, comfortably uses the word \\"victory\\" to describe this achievement by the Fourth Crusade. The slaughter and mayhem that followed should have been predictable; the First Crusade had established a pattern for that. What adds gall to this army's conduct was the desecration of perhaps the greatest collection of art and sacred relics in the civilized world at that time. Far from being exhilarated, Innocent was incensed not only by the carnage of the innocent but by the political repercussions.<br /><br />The Roman West was now holding the seat of the entire Eastern Empire. The Fourth Crusade did not formally end. It morphed into a sixty year effort by successive western occupiers of the throne of Constantinople [Baldwin being the first] to subjugate both the Greek and the Asian ends of the Eastern Empire. That effort formally collapsed in 1261, but not before draining European resources to the point that there would never be a fifth crusade.> <br />And so it came to be that a Crusade once intended for Alexandria and Jerusalem proceeded in a diametrically opposite direction, north to the cradle of the Eastern Roman Empire.

To put this in perspective, the lizard was consuming the spider in the Washington Senators' dugout during a Florida spring training game. Manager Ted Williams, fascinated by this, commanded all the players on the bench to join him in watching this little drama of nature unfold. The Senator then batting, Mike Epstein, struck out and was berated by Williams--not for striking out, but for scaring away the lizard when he returned to the dugout.<br /><br />Although the comparisons between Williams and Joe DiMaggio have been beaten into the ground, it is hard to find another player like Williams in the history of the game. Throughout this work I found myself comparing Williams to Mickey Mantle. They have much in common, the greatest similarity being the \\"what if?\\" factor. What if Mantle had not injured his knees? What if Williams had not missed so many prime years in the service? What if both men had devoted themselves to becoming well-rounded players?<br /><br />The baseball player Williams comes across here as somewhat one-dimensional. His batting feats are well known, of course. But he was not particularly fast, and his outfield play was a subject of some concern. He was switched from center field to left field early in his career to make room for the far superior fielder Dom DiMaggio. He was a moody player who on occasion did not run out grounders or chase batted balls aggressively. He would never be confused with a Joe Morgan or a Derek Jeter, men who mastered every aspect of their game and understand the playing field as a giant chessboard.<br /><br />But in fairness to Williams, he played for an organization that was somewhat unfocused itself. Montville portrays the Boston Red Sox as something of a family operation, an easy going boozy ownership and management that lacked the crisp, businesslike demeanor of their greatest rivals, the New York Yankees. Montville contends that when Williams joined the Sox in the late 1930's, the organization exploited him at a time when he could have used a Tony LaRussa or a Joe Torre to explain the reality of life to this young star. Instead, the Red Sox manipulated its lineup and the park dimensions themselves to milk more Williams home runs from his mighty bat. Expectations were set by the hard boiled Boston press and ultimately the fans, putting Williams in a no win situation. Even his 1941 phenomenal .406 season never warmed public sentiment. After World War II, when the Red Sox roster included Bobby Doerr, Dom DiMaggio, and Johnny Pesky, among others, the Sox were perennial bridesmaids to the Yankees [or occasionally to the Indians], a highly talented team without the killer instinct. When Williams returned to the team after the Korean War, the veterans were gone and for his last seasons Williams played alongside bonus babies who never developed star potential.<br /><br />Born in San Diego to a guitar-strumming mother on perpetual evangelical crusades, Williams never received appropriate adult focus and structure as he grew up. A creature of impulse, he developed into a demanding young man who liked his gratifications promptly and his will unobstructed. He was capable of prolonged grudges against individuals and organizations. His three marriages were by all accounts unmitigated disasters, and it is fair to say that Williams' cruelties toward his wives was repaid in kind by  their offspring in his twilight years. His cursing was as remarkable as his hitting; the blasphemous edge to it shocked even veteran players.<br /><br />This is not to say that Williams was a scoundrel. He was highly patriotic and served his country twice with distinction. He had many friends among the players. His charity work for the Jimmy Fund and lesser known causes went far beyond the call of the average player. Aside from philandering, his recreations were generally healthy, hisgreatest passion being his fishing. While he was not a tree hugger, by any stretch, he was deeply disturbed by the commercialization of the Florida Keys [though one suspects his concerns were more about the disruption of good fishing than, say, global warming.]. Montville reports that Williams did have a successful long term relationship with one lover that endured through several marriages.<br /><br />While the quality of this work is consistent from cover to cover, the treatment of Williams' old age merits special attention. Williams had fathered three children, two of whom seemed contented to ride their father's gravy train. But the third, his only son John Henry Williams, demonstrated a peculiar talent for cashing in on his father's name and bringing disgrace to the Williams legacy. A rather unfocused young man in his early years, John Henry turned his attention to the marketing of his father's signatures. The senior Williams suffered from several strokes and was growing increasingly blind and dependent upon those around him. John Henry Williams made him a virtual prisoner of his own home, isolated him from his old friends like Pesky and Dom DiMaggio, and installed video surveillance throughout the residence to make sure that no autographs were spirited away for old friends or acquaintances. It is a sad ending for the Hall of Famer, reduced to the level of the absurd by John Henry's cryogenic nightmare of freezing his father after death.<br /><br />It is through this final portion of the book that one feels some sympathy for Williams, though the reader will also be forced to face the realization that the apples do not fall far from the tree. Williams was indeed a great hitter, but like \\"Casey at the Bat\\" he brought little joy to Mudville in the process.y healthy, his greatest passion being his fishing.

US	52709329	R2KUJVSXRBDKGW	0375504540	99959139	America's Game: The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation	Books	5	12	12	N	Y	No Instant Replay; Thoughtful Research and Analysis Instead	Michael MacCambridge has produced a volume of research and analysis worthy of any historical bookshelf. Let the reader beware: the author is nothing but faithful to his title. This is not a nostalgic romp with the Decatur Staleys, nor a highlight reel in words. Rather, MacCambridge traces and assesses how the corporate NFL has managed itself from its humble pre-World War II status to a position today of sports preeminence.<br /><br />For starters, the author does not think much of pro football before 1945. Pro football was a confederation of teams, all of which were north and east of a line between Chicago and Washington. The owners were a club unto themselves, mostly Catholic and educated by nuns. Their greatest gifts to the game, in MacCambridge's view, are that they did not muck it up too much and they elected Bert Bell to serve as commissioner after the war. Bell was not the brightest bulb in the chandelier--his selection smacks of cronyism as much as anything--but in his humble, gracious way, Bell served the game as well as the owners. He was the first commissioner who sensed an obligation to protect the game itself.<br /><br />He was challenged quickly enough by another major figure in this work, Paul Brown, and a new league taking shape, the All America Football Conference. The AAFC enjoyed a brief flare of success in the late 1940's, with franchises in glamour cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. On the field, however, the premiere team was Cleveland, where Brown invented the model of modern coaching management. Cleveland and its imitators in the AAFC were simply too good to go away. Bell decided to pick the franchises he wanted and add them to the NFL fraternity. By 1950 the NFL was coast to coast and the enemy had been destroyed.<br /><br />With Bell's sudden death in 1959, the NFL owners closeted for eleven days, and when the white smoke poured from football's Sistine Chapel, there on the balcony stood the longest of long shots, the Rams General Manager Pete Rozelle, 33. If there is a hero in this book it is Rozelle. He, too, was tested from the start, by a number of millionaires from across the country, in particular the south, clamoring for league expansion and new franchises.<br /><br />In truth, the old guard did not want expansion, but unlike baseball with its antitrust exemption, the NFL under Rozelle was indeed vulnerable to a charge of cabalistic behavior. Rozelle could not play dumb as Bell had. There were too many suitors now, at least a dozen. As these prospective new owners gravitated toward a new American League, Rozelle tried to slow the momentum by the early 1960's addition of Dallas, Minnesota, and Atlanta franchises to the NFL. In hindsight, Rozelle might have done better to appease Lamar Hunt, the driving force behind the new AFL.<br /><br />The titanic battle of the two leagues ended in 1966, with secret negotiations between Rozelle and Hunt [and not Al Davis, the actual AFL commissioner, who would get his pound of flesh from Rozelle] prompted by bidding wars for top draft choices and then established league stars. MacCambridge observes that negotiating conference alignments was as difficult as selling merger itself. Who of the old guard would go to the AFC?<br /><br />What made this entire enterprise workable, in the final analysis, was Roselle's management of television. Beginning in the 1960's Rozelle negotiated a series of network contracts that ensured many healthy benefits: national coverage [to feed enthusiasm of local fans], the much beloved \\"double-header game\\" at 4 PM, and most importantly, equal division of TV revenue among all teams. In addition, MacCambridge gives considerable attention to Rozelle's cultivation of Ed and Steve Sabol's NFL films production as an invaluable marketing tool of the league.<br /><br />MacCambridge is the first author of my experience to explain the significance of the USFL's suit against the NFL and its potential to destroy the league. The USFL, apleasant little league that enjoyed its workable niche in the springtime sports world, decided to go head to head with the NFL in the fall, and filed its now-famous antitrust suit. Rozelle's first instinct was to settle, but he and the owners were dissuaded by the brilliant attorney Paul Tagliabue. Tagliabue understood that a non-defense by the NFL would make the league vulnerable to suits from any sandlot league claiming to be shut out of the national TV market and demanding admission to the NFL.<br /><br />The USFL trial completely exhausted Rozelle, who resigned after a three decade tenure. His replacement in 1989, the steely Tagliabue, would find his tenure filled with home-grown problems. Player conduct, an absence of minority executives and coaches, unforeseen difficulties with the new league salary cap, and even a bare breasted Janet Jackson Superbowl fiasco would occupy his first fifteen years. But his biggest challenge came from the owners themselves over an issue considered anathema forty years before: franchise jumping. Los Angeles to Oakland, Los Angeles to St. Louis, Cleveland to Baltimore, and Houston's melancholic relocation to Vanderbilt University--this was a trend that would alienate the heart of the league's success, fan identification, not to mention a repudiation of the founding credo, \\"the good of the league.\\" Clearly, Tagliabue did not enjoy the power of a 1970 Rozelle, but the author notes that the commissioner was not Bud Selig, either. His compromise of restoring expansion franchises to Cleveland and Houston was better than nothing. And Tagliabue may have gotten help from an unexpected source: wholesale taxpayer opposition to publicly funded football stadiums, which would of necessity put a damper on owner enthusiasms.<br /><br />In the final analysis, MacCambridge believes that the NFL is still the healthiest of all professional sports in the United States in terms of fan base and business practices. This work contains an exhaustive bibliography that will probably send the reader off in several directions--at least till the season starts.pleasant little league that enjoyed its workable niche in the springtime sports world, decided to go head to head with the NFL in the fall, and filed its now-famous antitrust suit.

US	52709329	R5N491JWJHK8K	0819909211	699402192	A History of the Franciscan Order: From Its Origins to the Year 1517	Books	5	12	12	N	Y	Francis's Name, Bonaventure's Order	For four decades Bishop John Moorman's history of the Franciscan Order, from the early days of Francis to the division of the Order in 1517, has remained a reliable standard text for students of medieval religious life. The Franciscans were not the first religious order to appear in Christendom, nor was Francis the Church's only inventive founder. When the young Francis visited Pope Innocent III in 1209 to seek papal approbation for his little movement, the practice of the time would have been to consign these young idealists to the safety and credibility of an existing order--the Augustinians, perhaps--and specifically to an established and orthodox rule of life. However, Francis had his own ideas about a rule: he proposed a lifestyle drawn literally from Christ's preaching and example. Moorman, surprisingly, does not treat extensively of Francis himself, probably because it was the rule itself and its interpretations and enforcements that would shape the Franciscan story for years to come.<br /><br />The early Franciscan rule put the Church in an awkward position. It was hard to criticize a desire to live the absolute poverty of Jesus and perfect trust in the Father. And yet later popes and curial officials no doubt worried that such ideals could not be maintained, that men and women were vowing the unattainable and putting themselves at risk of despair and heresy. Moreover, Francis's primacy of poverty, fiercely defended by his survivors, would run headlong into another pressing demand, ministry of the Church. Friars needed vestments and vessels for Mass, scholars needed books for their studies. Ironically, many in the Order even felt that a magnificent church was needed for the body of the father of vowed absolute poverty.<br /><br />A pivotal character at this juncture was St. Bonaventure, Minister General of the Order [1257-74] who subtly but permanently established much of what would be recognized today as typically Franciscan. Bonaventure sensed that the friars could not maintain Francis's standard--he had only to open his eyes to see that--but that even the \\"noble effort\\" was winning respect from the Catholic populace of Europe. Bonaventure advocated strong clerical identity. The typical friar would be priest, not a lay brother. Bonaventure commissioned an official biography of Francis to reinforce this mainstream vision. Whatever one thinks of Bonaventure, his emphasis upon pastoral ministry, education, and missionary work brought inestimable spiritual riches to the medieval Church.<br /><br />Moorman, I believe, is comfortable with this Bonaventurian tectonic shift. The hard line conservatives of the Order, including the surviving contemporaries of Francis, regarded these evolving tendencies as an utter betrayal of Francis, and worse for them, as an indication that the Church itself--which naturally approved such development-- was corrupted and unworthy of allegiance. Such friars and their sympathizers rallied around the writings of the brilliant but extreme Franciscan Peter John Olivi. Olivi's admirers, Angelo of Clareno and Ubertino of Casale, would fuel the tragic struggle of the \\"spiritual Franciscans\\" versus the Order and the Church itself, notably the controversial John XXII, over the nature of Gospel poverty. It is hard not to get swept up in this drama, but Moorman labors to keep his eye on the bigger picture.<br /><br />Despite major questions about the plausibility of the Order itself, the Franciscan Order grew and diversified. Perhaps because Franciscanism is at heart an idea, the friars enjoyed an independence of mission; no ecclesiastical work was technically out of bounds for friars [though local clergy, bishops, and universities certainly disputed that.] The friars felt no reluctance to enter traditional parochial ministry, such as hearing confessions and burying the dead. Most of the popes in the three hundred year range of this book protected and endorsed the friars in the face of attacks of secularclergy, and with some exceptions, parish life in Italy and elsewhere was the richer for Franciscan presence.<br /><br />As early as 1224 the friars targeted the universities of western Europe as fertile ground for propagation of the Franciscan ideals and the attraction of new members. Moorman observes that considerable care was given to the assignment of exemplary friars to Oxford and other universities. The simplicity and evangelical fervor of these first friars encouraged famous, well-established professors to join the Order and establish tuition-free lectures and ultimately award degrees. John Peckham and Haymo of Faversham, among others, brought credit to the Order in the thirteenth century. Later friar scholars would prove to be more controversial--Duns Scotus, Olivi, and particularly the nominalist and political philosopher William of Ockham.<br /><br />Another ministry of particular interest was missionary work, which Francis himself had attempted with the Saracens in a somewhat Quixotic venture. Curiously, as Moorman devotes considerable attention to this work, the missions of the friars after Francis were every bit as dramatic and courageous as those of the founder--and at times equally Quixotic. The spectacular work of Ramon Lull, John of Piancarpino, William Rubruk and John of Montecorvino, for example, brought the message of Christianity as far as China, though in many cases without wholesale conversions. Moorman also provides valuable and insightful accounts of the Clarisses or Poor Clares, as well as the lay Franciscans. The author has little use for the beguines and other marginalized but fervent lay communities of reformers; more recent scholarship understands the relationship between the Order and the beguines as more complex.<br /><br />The forces of reform pressing the gates of Catholicism in the fifteenth century could hardly leave the friars untouched. A new idealism for the Rule of the Order, unsullied by  the Olivi-John XXII bloodbath of the 1300`s, began to divide the friars more significantly than the old spiritualist battles of two centuries previous. In 1516 Pope Leo X issued \\"Ite Vos,\\" an encyclical which in essence created two Franciscan Orders, observant and conventuals. Moorman assesses this division with a resigned, philosophic sadness.

Books	5	4	4	N	N	Hey Uncle Marv, Tell Us More Stories About "The Kohawks"	Recent history has been kind to Marv Levy as the magnificence of having won four consecutive AFC Conference championships is now replacing the earlier bitter pill of lost Superbowls. Marv Levy has become the ceremonial uncle of professional football today. He is to pro football what George Foreman is to pro boxing, the friendly enduring face of a brutal sport.<br /><br />This is a campfire book, a grown-up bedtime story about a bright young lad from Chicago, one of those lucky folks who got paid to do what he liked. It is a tale remarkably devoid of rancor or regrets but rather a mixture of self-deprecating humor, a bit of self-serving forgetfulness, colorful characters, and the pleasures of the jocular world of organized football. In his preface Levy advises us that his writing style is the re-creation of the pleasures of his memory. Take away the Kansas City Chiefs and he would have had the perfect life.<br /><br />But before arriving at Kansas City, there were the minor matters of World War II, college, and building a resume. Levy entered the Army Air Corps with the help of a friend who, shall we say, understated Levy's vision impairment. When this problem was later detected, Levy was scratched from pilot training and spent much of the war in Florida as a weather observer. After the war, already in possession of a bachelor's degree from Coe College, Levy began his much heralded graduate work at Harvard. In truth he opted out of the law school in three weeks, choosing instead to earn a masters in history and collecting inspiring anecdotes for use in the Buffalo Bills' locker room years later.<br /><br />Levy had abandoned law school because of his desire to coach football. After a stint as assistant coach back at Coe for the mighty \\"Kohawks,\\" Levy over the next fifteen years crafted a highly respectable resume of work as head coach of generally mid-range college football teams, primarily New Mexico, California, and William & Mary. It was a stunning upset of the nation's number one team, Navy, by an undermanned William and Mary crew in 1967 that brought Levy to the attention of NFL, and eventually to the staff of George Allen in Washington as special teams coach.<br /><br />Levy could not help but be influenced by his Redskins boss. Allen referred to his defensive linemen as \\"rushers,\\" benched the popular pass-happy Sonny Jurgensen for the workmanlike Billy Kilmer, and played for the least mistakes. A running offense, a veteran opportunistic defense, and juiced up special teams play were his trademarks. Allen seems to have taken to Levy because of the latter's own imaginative thinking about the critical nature of special teams' play, which comprises about 30% of an average NFL game. Moreover, Levy could not have missed how Allen cultivated an image and played the psychological card adroitly.<br /><br />Levy, a man not without ambition, was anxious to run his own ship, and in 1973 became the head coach of the Montreal Alouettes. Once the flagship of the Canadian Football League, the Alouettes were an artistic, aesthetic, and organizational shipwreck, bedeviled by an atrocious stadium, poor attendance, and impossible weather. Levy guided Montreal to the Grey Cup final in his first year and a league championship the following season.  His five successful campaigns in Canada brought an invitation to come back south of the border and take the reins of the young Kansas City Chiefs.<br /><br />In many ways the Chiefs Levy inherited in 1978 were very much like the present day Chiefs-a potent offense with a porous defense. He also inherited an overbearing club president, Jack Steadman, who did not understand Levy's priority of drafting for defense [Art Still, Mike Bell, Gary Spani, among others], nor his coach's penchant for a tough ground game a la his contemporary \\"Ground Chuck\\" Knox. Perhaps reflecting the thinking of his old mentor George Allen, Levy believed that an adequate quarterback could direct the Chiefs, as Billy Kilmer had in Washington. At Kansas City Levy inherited the aging QB Mike Livingston and drafted Clemson's Steve Fuller. Steadman--and Lamar Hunt himself-- created what was probably an unnecessary controversy in their criticisms of the quarterbacking position, a situation aggravated by the arrival of yet another QB, the gunslinger Bill Kenney.<br /><br />The Chiefs improved, and the defense became stellar, but neither Hunt, Steadman, nor many of the fans were satisfied with a .500 team. Released from the Chiefs in 1982, Levy would always remember how a meddlesome front office and instability at the quarterback position could undermine an otherwise flawless rebuilding program. Thus, when Levy accepted the Buffalo Bills' call in midseason 1986, it is no coincidence that he had already over the years cultivated friendships with owner Ralph Wilson and his executive staff of Bill Polian and John Butler, and that the quarterback situation was quite stable under the maturing Jim Kelly. Clearly a unity of respect and purpose among all levels of Buffalo management marked Levy's years with the Bills and allowed the team to focus entirely on drafting, development, and execution.<br /><br />Levy assumes that most readers know of the exploits of the Bills in their glory years, and as a rule he paints with a broad red, white, and blue brush. As a history major himself, he has forgotten or omitted some situations that still intrigue knowledgeable observers: his protest of Cincinnati's no huddle offense to the NFL Commissioner prior to the 1988 AFC Championship [a style of play which, ironically, would become the hallmark of the Bills, the K-Gun] or Thurman Thomas's missing helmet episode at the opening of the 1992 Superbowl. But there is self-revelation as well. Levy was over 60 when hired by the Bills; he admits that he had begun to doubt whether he would ever coach again. How could he know then that his best days were yet to come?ly Kilmer had in Washington. At Kansas City Levy inherited the aging QB Mike Livingston and drafted Clemson's Steve Fuller.

Whether the Irish practices are fully understood in their own existential setting is another matter. Many authors and teachers have tended in my lifetime to accent the practice of Catholic Penance before and after the Irish heyday, which by holy legend begins with St. Patrick and extends through the Roman \\"dark ages.\\" Thus the Irish introduction of a repeatable sacramental absolution looks like a mitigation of a more muscular canonical penance of the third century, for example, and as the foundation of a regrettably casuistic and overly juridical penitential rite of the Middle Ages and beyond.<br /><br />Hugh Connolly's theological overview of the Irish Penitentials argues that the morality and practice of Sacramental Penance that emerged in Ireland is not a reaction to anything. It is rather an almost totally indigenous development from Irish religious and social culture. Irish Catholicism has its historical roots in monasticism, which even in Patrick's day had developed a distinctive philosophy of human nature, virtue, and holiness as evidenced in the writings of John Cassian, among others. But the preexisting Druid culture, tribal loyalties, and absence of Roman civil order all played influence on the formation of Irish Catholicism and consequently in penitential practice. To cite but two examples: Druid religious practice included the function of a \\"brehon\\" or conscience mentor, along with a philosophy well known to Christian monks already, \\"curing by contraries.\\"<br /><br />It is less surprising then that Irish monasteries would soon be celebrating a new form of penitential action which involved both a regular interpersonal encounter and specific directive in response to the ills of the soul. Thus the emergence of the Penitentials, a series of works produced for the mentor/confessor which detailed the variety of ills [sins] and the appropriate curative action. The reader may be disappointed with a lack of detail as to how and when this doctor/patient or mentor/student model became identified with the canonical forgiveness of sin through the laying on of hands by the bishop, the continental practice of the time. Connolly may give a hint: the geography and lack of roads precluded the development of large cities and by extension powerful bishoprics [Ireland was never a Roman colony.] Ecclesiastic leadership would soon become identified with abbots and remain so for many years. Cuius regio, cuius religio, so to speak?<br /><br />Connolly introduces the authors of the primary Penitentials of the era: Finnian [d. 549], Columbanus [d. 615], Cummean [d. 662], Adamnan [d. 704] and several English and Welsh contributors from among monastic sources. It is somewhat comforting to at least know the names of the men and the direction of their thought, for this knowledge makes the Penitential era somewhat less grim than is usually portrayed. Connolly briefly describes the theology and style of each, though the emphasis would seem to be upon their general unity of purpose. The fact that there are at least a dozen authors, whose writings spread out over several centuries, suggests at the very least a development of moral theology and possibly several differing schools of thought on the penitential process itself, though the author does not indicate this.<br /><br />The working outline of the text is the family of vices themselves, beginning with what one might call the \\"weakness of the flesh\\" variety [gluttony, avarice, anger] to the more calculated and presumably deadlier types [vainglory and pride]. Two principles of Irish Penance become immediately evident. The first is the tribal sense of retribution. Penalties for sins against others tend toward a restoration of equilibrium and fair play. Thus the murderer, for example, is expected to make perpetual restoration of lost wages to the victim's widow. The second is the above-mentioned principle of \\"curing by contraries\\" in which the assigned retribution is crafted to enhance a specific virtue relative to the sinful act or tendency confessed. The envious person, for example, is counseled toward a life of material almsgiving.<br /><br />While this is a most useful introductory work-one of the few such treatments of the Penitentials currently available in English-there are some maddening deficiencies that cannot be overlooked. The first is what I would call an absence of practical footing, or in other words, how did this system really work in Ireland on a day to day basis? Connolly writes somewhat like St. Luke in the Acts of the Apostles; he stresses the ideal over the real. In fact the author gives us nothing to judge the actual pastoral effectiveness of a penitential system that did indeed ask a lot of the intrepid confessee. A second criticism is an absence of any analysis of literary style. In graduate school I had a professor who remarked that the Penitentials were among the most pornographic literature to emerge in western literature given the graphic detail of sexual misconduct. John Noonan's citations from the Penitentials in his classic work \\"Contraception\\" were nothing if blushingly precise. In this work one would come away thinking that the Penitentials were akin to \\"The Imitation of Christ,\\" which clearly they were not.<br /><br />The author devotes a sizable portion of this work, perhaps 40%, to the relationship of the Irish Penitentials to \\"Ordo Paenitentiae\\" or the new rite of Penance approved for the Roman Catholic Church in 1973. In all honesty this project seems contrived, as if the author or editor had perceived some necessity to make the Penitentials \\"relevant\\" to the current pastoral practice of Penance. In the first instance, the author has not sufficiently established how successful the Irish practice of canonical penance was in its own time, let alone the era after Vatican II. And secondly, the era of the Penitentials was only one stage of a two-millennium development. And in truth I believe that present day difficulties with the contemporary practice of canonical Penance are more serious than the author portrays them.ages to the victim's widow.

Kennedy to the presidency occurred when I was in the seventh grade of my local parochial school. In the Catholic/Democratic atmosphere of East Buffalo, and probably in Tim Russert's South Buffalo as well, the resulting ascendancy of a Catholic to the White House was a vindication. We knew that a Catholic had run once before; in fact, he had been governor of our own state. The popular wisdom of the Catholic grass roots held that the first intrepid candidate had lost because he was a Catholic, and a lot of America did not like Catholics. It did not occur to a seventh grader that people vote for lots of reasons, and that this was true in 1928 as in 1960.<br /><br />Alfred E. Smith, a man of no small accomplishment, lost miserably to Herbert Hoover in a 1928 presidential election that added little to the American character.  It may be true that his Catholicism was a major factor in his defeat, but biographer Robert A. Slayton provides a balanced study of Smith that gives reason to pause. We see early in this work that Smith [particularly when compared to Hoover] suffered from major deficiencies in his political upbringing that affected his judgment and contributed to a naivet&eacute; about the nature of the American electorate.<br /><br />Born in 1873 in New York's infamous Fourth Ward, there was no way that young Smith would not be baptized into the two religions of his neighborhood: the Roman Catholic Church and Tammany Hall. At his local St. James Parish he received his elementary school education from the Christian Brothers. It is doubtful that he absorbed any particularly subversive tendencies of church and state at St. James. Catholic schools of the time were a laborious financial undertaking for Catholic bishops of the day, who considered them a necessary refuge against the virulent anti-Catholic attitudes of many public school curriculums. What Smith certainly absorbed from his Catholic upbringing was New York's multiculturalism, a phenomenon not understood and generally feared in the predominantly agricultural and Protestant Middle America.<br /><br />Tammany Hall, one of America's most notorious yet beneficent Democratic political machines, would also demonstrate in Smith's day that same ability to adapt to cultural diversity despite its Irish heritage. Tammany was the incarnation of Tip O'Neill's dictum that \\"all politics is local.\\" Slayton has no argument with this philosophy except to note that it is notorious bad presidential politics. Thus from the formative years Smith emerges as the Catholic/Tammany wounded duck.<br /><br />But Smith postponed his inevitable denouement for a long time. For much of his life his personality, loyalty, affability and attention to detail, not to mention his \\"made man\\" status with the Tammany war horses, were enough to see him through his political climb. Despite its size and stature, New York State government was Byzantine and unwieldy. The legislature itself was a purgatory for a man without some kind of particular agenda, and Smith found his in the very organization of state government. With little to do, he became that body's best studied member and probably the best informed of the lot; he had something of Bob Taft's feel for the paper of legislation but with a much more extroverted personality. His counsel became cherished and his respect among his peers flourished.<br /><br />And, he was lucky, though it is also true that men can make their own luck through hard work. On March 25, 1911 a fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company Fire in New York killed 146 workers. The dimensions of this tragedy and the accompanying neglect of worker safety made labor reform a statewide issue, allowing Smith to conduct emotional public hearings throughout the state. This exposure, and his public advocacy for a popular issue, put him into the New York State governor's mansion in 1919. With the invaluable help of Belle Moskowitz, Frances Perkins, and Robert Moses, among others, Smith continued his program of reform of the state constitution and generally pleased voters enough to maintain office more often than not in the dreadful decade of 1920's national Democratic defeats.<br /><br />When William McAdoo declined to seek the presidential nomination in 1928, Governor Smith was virtually unopposed within his party. Suffice to say that once he stepped onto the national stage, however, all of his assets of many years became liabilities. His New York bonhomie, his Catholicism, his parochial accent, and his enjoyment of spirits in the age of the Volstead Act doomed his campaign from the start. He was running against the extremely popular Coolidge legacy, against a candidate who knew how to avoid mistakes. To borrow a metaphor from this century, the \\"red states\\" were really red, and there were many more of them in 1928.<br /><br />Having said that, there is no denying that the 1928 campaign set the twentieth century low water mark for bigotry and ugliness. Slayton points out that the KKK of the 1920's was primarily an anti-Catholic movement; Jim Crow laws made Negro intimidation relatively unnecessary at the time. Catholicism was understood as a foreign invasion of lower class degenerates who drank excessively and usurped the jobs of present American citizens. The Democratic ticket was seen as an endorsement of this demographic shift, and voters turned upon the top of the ticket with a particular vehemence. Smith's parochialism had not prepared him for this, and the intensity of feeling against him, along with the size of the defeat, seems to have left psychological scars that remained with Smith for the rest of his life.<br /><br />After this grueling ordeal, it galled Smith all the more that the perceived savior of his party was a man he considered a political lightweight, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. As long as FDR lived, Smith would never get his electoral revenge.

They need to go back further. A full century ago the Daytona-Ormond region was noted for style. Not exactly Charleston, SC, perhaps, but a place where the rich and famous wintered thanks to excellent rail service. Among these winter guests were industrialists who could not sit still for four months waiting for the fish to bite. With the invention and development of the combustible engine, the Atlantic beach became for a time America's test track.<br /><br />Author Ed Hinton is best known as a longtime beat reporter for modern day stock car racing, but his research into the early days of Daytona motorsports is surprisingly good. As early as 1903 an annual winter racing festival was established, fueled by both the daring of a new breed of test drivers and the research and development interests of major auto manufacturers. This was long before the empowerment of any official sanctioning body; templates and restrictor plates were unheard of. The conditions and the technology favored racing the clock, and by the time Wilbur and Orville had reached flight further up the coast, test drivers were pushing the 100mph envelope at the Daytona-Ormond city line.<br /><br />Curiously, the greatest day of Daytona beach racing was in a sense its death knell. There would be a limit as to how much traction could be generated by sand and rubber, and in 1933 Sir Malcolm Campbell--in a hair-raising exhibition-discovered that dangerous point. He stretched his Bluebird to the unthinkable speed of 330 mph along the beach track, then turned around to complete the required stretch for an official world record. At 300mph he lost control of his car but--in what must have been one of the greatest maneuvering feats ever--recovered the car and finished the run. He was also finished with the unpredictability of Atlantic beach conditions, and he joined the exodus to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.<br /><br />One of the heart-pounding spectators of this feat was one William France. A good mechanic and a part-time Saturday night racer in the Washington, DC suburbs, France was also something of a social philosopher on the subject of racing. He discovered among other things that many promoters were dishonest, that good engines were not generally available to the driver of average means like himself, and that in the unregulated world of local racing, there was no protection for individual competitors. And though he probably never tasted moonshine whiskey, he was not so puritanical as to ignore the skill and technology of \\"moonshine transporters.\\"<br /><br />With the emigrations to Utah and Indiana of big name drivers, the Depression-ravaged Daytona area was open to about any money making idea, though France's first beachfront stock car races in the late 1930's were not exactly bonanzas. As a promoter France discovered that drivers cheated as often as management, and his conviction deepened for the need of a powerful sanctioning body. After the war hiatus, France was enough of a force to create NASCAR in 1947 with himself, not surprisingly, as its not so benevolent dictator. He had a knack for getting ahead of parades that had started without him-Harold Brasington's daring 1.3 mile super-speedway at Darlington, SC in 1949, and the concept of the 500 mile race at a time when no one knew if a stock car could actually do that. When by 1955 he saw that both concepts were eminently successful, and developers were clamoring for Daytona beachfront sites, France set in motion the construction of today's 2.5-mile super-speedway, where the inaugural race was held in February 1959.<br /><br />By this point in his history Hinton is now in the world of races he himself attended with drivers he knew intimately well. Daytona is only one of at least twenty sanctioned tracksin stock car's senior circuit, and the second half of this work is the story of the \\"annual visits,\\" through which we see the development, the glory years, and the declines of the great ones of the modern era. In his introduction the author notes that his book was almost finished at the time of Earnhardt's death during the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500. While he describes that race with particular emphasis upon the Earnhardt tragedy, it does not appear that he extensively reworked his text in light of the accident. Translate: the Intimidator wasn't \\"cleaned up\\" for posterity.<br /><br />But because of his closeness to this generation of drivers, Hinton cannot quite contain himself to the Daytona scene. There are great stories to be told, rivalries probed, genuinely funny incidents that occurred many miles from Daytona that spice the second half of the work. I have to admit that many of these tales we've heard before-though here we get them in the uncensored quotes of sources like Darrell Waltrip.

In Smith's time the school enrolled 1,450 students, of which the Christian Brothers taught the 650 boys and the Sisters of Charity the girls. Today we might think of 1,450 students as a healthy enrollment for a Catholic secondary school in a large city. In 1878 and for years after the youngest Catholic students in massive numbers enjoyed the privilege of first rate education in a faith-based environment. It was truly a world of \\"no child left behind.\\"<br /><br />The fuel for this educational dynamo was neither ecclesiastical fiat nor fiscal sufficiency. It was the vowed life and services of thousands of Catholic women and men religious who brought the religious vision and charism of their various orders and communities to school settings. The changes in Catholic education between 1878 and 2005-particularly the virtual disappearance of the religious classroom educator-are poorly understood and routinely understated. Today's Catholic elementary school faculty is lay and generally married with family. None have the rigorous training of religious formation and novitiate; few have anything amounting to college specialization in theology. While most would probably profess the Catholic faith, few have the comfort to teach as an unabashed apologist for the Catholic Tradition. \\"A prophet is not without honor....\\"<br /><br />One cannot read this recent compilation from the Paulist Press Western Spirituality series without a sense that the life and wisdom of St. John Baptist de la Salle is perhaps the publisher's most practical and useful release to date. La Salle [1651-1719], a wealthy priest and cathedral canon, fretted over issues of education facing France in the late seventeenth century. As with other volumes in this series, the introduction is extremely useful in briefly outlining the nature of the problems and La Salle's biographical attempts to meet them for the Church.<br /><br />The problem was simple enough and certainly one familiar to contemporary Americans: only the children of the rich were getting top-flight education. Because of the French marriage of church and state, there was no secular or public education system in place. And in this, the era of the Sun King, there was no great hurry to educate the unwashed masses anyway. French Catholicism unfortunately shared something of this view: education of upper echelon youths toward a clerical life, law, and diplomacy was useful to the Church and the state. Mass education smacked of the dreaded \\"D\\" word. Neither hierarchy nor monarchy had time for democracy.<br /><br />La Salle's marriage of faith formation, education, and equality is one of great achievements of the Post-Tridentine era. No one melded these goals into a spirituality of education as La Salle did. The primary task of a Catholic educator, he wrote, was his students' salvation, i.e., getting them into heaven. [Mention that at a diocesan school meeting today.] The establishment of religious identity in a child's mind is already a form of liberation, for all stand equal before God. La Salle understood the mind of the rich [he was practically one of them], and he knew that none of his charges stood a chance in the world of commerce without some measure of grace and manners. Chapters four and five, on school discipline and general decorum, must be read in this light.<br /><br />That La Salle chose only laymen for this work is a great mystery. One is tempted to say that La Salle was anticipating Vatican II, but in fact the more likely answer is his belief that the classroom was a full time apostolate. Further, he would probably have failed in his efforts to wholesale recruit ordained clergy, who on the whole were quite upper crust in his day. La Salle himself suggests this when, in a moment of weakness, he compares his brothers unfavorably to his valet. In truth the first brothers were somewhat ruffians, and La Salle took considerable grief from his family and the Church for housing such men. Much of his writing is thus directed toward the formation of the brothers themselves in the form of rules, letters, meditations and retreats, not to mention the decorum and essentials of pedagogy. A day would come when his religious brothers turned against him, arguing with some credibility that La Salle could return to his cushy canon's life whereas they had nowhere to go. La Salle thus composed \\"The Heroic Vow,\\" a solemn promise that he and his most intimate followers would essentially go down with the ship.<br /><br />In his writing La Salle addresses questions that plague Catholic education to this day. For example, he did not as a rule accept the unchurched into his schools. He believed that proselytizing and the reconciliation of fallen-away Catholics was more appropriately the mission of the clergy and the parish itself. On the other hand, he had a certain compassion for the hard lives of parents, and reminded his brothers that they must drill their students repeatedly in the prayers and essentials of the Faith. He examines the problem of truancy from many perspectives, and concludes that in some cases the teacher himself may be the reason. [Mention that at a faculty meeting today.] He grasped the reality of \\"special needs\\" students long before the term was invented.<br /><br />If American Catholic schools are not to return to a Louis XIV-style bastion of the upper class with five figure tuition rates, La Salle's vision of the school as an egalitarian venture to save souls needs revisiting. This compilation of La Salle's writings is a most useful cornerstone for the spirituality and identity of today's Catholic schoolteacher and rekindles a sense of urgency in regenerating the mission of primary Catholic education. The seventeenth century La Salle has amazing relevance to the twenty-first century American Catholic parochial situation. Curiously, in the present political climate, La Salle's vision seems ready for a second blooming.ewhat ruffians, and La Salle took considerable grief from his family and the Church for housing such men.

He believed that proselytizing and the reconciliation of fallen-away Catholics was more appropriately the mission of the clergy and the parish itself. On the other hand, he had a certain compassion for the hard lives of parents, and reminded his brothers that they must drill their students repeatedly in the prayers and essentials of the Faith. He examines the problem of truancy from many perspectives, and concludes that in some cases the teacher himself may be the reason. [Mention that at a faculty meeting today.] He grasped the reality of \\"special needs\\" students long before the term was invented.  <br /> <br />If American Catholic schools are not to return to a Louis XIV-style bastion of the upper class with five figure tuition rates, La Salle's vision of the school as an egalitarian venture to save souls needs revisiting. This compilation of La Salle's writings is a most useful cornerstone for the spirituality and identity of today's Catholic schoolteacher and rekindles a sense of urgency in regenerating the mission of primary Catholic education. The seventeenth century La Salle has amazing relevance to the twenty-first century American Catholic parochial situation. Curiously, in the present political climate, La Salle's vision seems ready for a second blooming. <br />	2005-02-06

To call them friends might have been a stretch. Jimmy, the savviest of the three, suffered from what we might call today a conduct disorder. He engaged in risky behaviors that startled his two compadres and raised eyebrows of adults. Sean was brighter than the rest, though not smart enough to realize that Jimmy was stealing his prized items from right under his nose. Dave was what we would call today the nerd, struggling to prove himself worthy of the other two with poorly timed jokes and the other mannerisms of estrangement. They were a little pack, and if they had been animals instead of boys, the Discovery Channel would have commented on their strange interdependence for survival in the dangerous jungle.<br /><br />But boys will be boys, and one day while scrapping in the street they are accosted by plain clothes detectives in an unmarked car who order them into the back seat for the perfunctory \\"scare `em good and call their parents\\" routine. Here we see the defining moment of their personalities. The pliant and thoroughly frightened Dave follows orders, but Jimmy and Sean could not help but notice that Boston's finest were looking a bit seedy that morning. Why, the back seat was littered with trash, for gosh sakes. It was as if the cops sized up the other two and vice versa, and both groups backed off with Dave alone in the back seat. Only later do Jimmy and Sean realize that they had let their erstwhile sidekick ride off into the unknown with hardened pedophiles. Dave would return four days later, to forever bear the invisible brand of damaged goods on his psyche.<br /><br />Turn the clock ahead twenty five years, to a time when Pedro pitched every fifth day and Nomar anchored the Sox infield. The boys were now grizzled men. Dave had somehow married and survived his ordeal, on the surface at least. But he is not doing well professionally, and one senses that deep inside he carries the mark of Cain and the energy for a terrible day of reckoning. Sean had worked his way to detective rank on the Boston police force. Jimmy, not surprisingly, had taken the more sinister route. By the age of eighteen he was the acknowledged crime captain of his neighborhood, a poor man's Godfather. Married with an infant child, he had been pinched by the cops, kept his mouth shut, done the dime, and returned to his neighborhood in higher esteem than ever.<br /><br />But now he wanted out of that business. His beloved wife had died, leaving him sole parent of a young girl who did not know him. Jimmy opened a legitimate concern and invested himself over the years in making a life for his beloved daughter, Katie. She had indeed grown into a fine young eighteen year old woman with enough of her father's spunk to occasionally do something stupid, like drink with her friends in a less than reputable neighborhood. It was on such an outing, the night before her niece's First Communion, that Katie's life would come to its tragic demise.<br /><br />This grisly murder sparks a parallel investigation. Sean, of course, seeks the perpetrator as a matter of course. This, after all, is his life's avocation. The fact that the victim is the daughter of his old chum adds an emotional element, but Sean is all business. He is relentless, but he works in the civilized world of due process. His investigation is slow, painstaking, thorough, and in the context of what follows, not fast enough. He has a suspect in mind, but he works slowly and prudently enough that in case he is wrong, no harm and no foul.<br /><br />Jimmy, alas, has no such encumbrances. He too seeks his daughter's killer. Coming out of retirement, so to speak, he has no worries about district attorneys and tainted evidence. Jimmy has a suspect in his sights, too. But even with his freedom of movement, he is having as much difficulty as Sean is until he receives damning information from about as unsuspecting an informant as one can imagine. In a scene worthy of a Hitchcock film, Jimmy hears what he wants to hear from a witness whose meaning is entirely misconstrued. Thus fortified, he becomes judge, jury, and executioner.<br /><br />In the final tally, both Sean and Jimmy are wrong in their conclusions, though Sean has done nothing that can't be fixed. Jimmy, on the other hand, is responsible for multiple deaths, if one includes the psychological disarray of his informant. We say good bye to the neighborhood of Jimmy, Dave and Sean with the sense that Jimmy is dead, too. Dead to the years of decency when his Katie saved him from his worst criminal self. Jimmy, it is clear, bears no remorse. The worst may be yet to come.mant as one can imagine.

Both men, in their enthusiasm of the moment, apparently never faced the crucible of idealism meeting practicality. Francis eschewed the prevailing wisdom of a constitutional government for his new religious movement in favor of a lifestyle extracted from Gospel quotes and Jesus' own example. Innocent, himself one of the most brilliant and realistic men ever to sit upon the Throne of Peter, surprisingly gave his blessing to this experiment. In their defense, neither man probably knew how big this would all become; though Innocent of all people should have had an inkling of the doctrinal and legal problems that lie ahead.<br /><br />David Burr describes in scholarly detail the victims of this oversight. This is the tale of the men and women who believed that the Rule and Testament of Francis as approved by Innocent and his immediate successor were a sacred and permanent expression of the will of God, a grace granted to the Church in a time of extreme need, and the first fruits of a new age of renewal in the Holy Spirit. As the author admits, just defining \\"Spiritual Franciscans\\" is a historian's challenge. Do you include the friars scandalized by the opulence of Francis's funeral and burial site? Those who opposed later papal tinkering and definitions of the vow of poverty? Those upset with the general drift toward urban living and university life? Those who believed that Bonaventure, Peckham, Celano and others were engaged in revisionist history to justify the Order's lifestyle of, say, 1275?<br /><br />Burr acknowledges the struggles within the Franciscan Order from virtually its inception. He dates the identifiable crystallization of traditional dissent over the vow of poverty to the life and work of Peter John Olivi. A Franciscan scholar and mystic who produced his major body of work in the last quarter of the thirteenth century, Olivi set out, perhaps unwittingly, to undo Bonaventure. As the latter labored to domesticate Francis and his ideals into the mainstream of Catholic life and doctrine, Olivi took the reverse approach. Francis of Assisi was not just another holy son of the Church; he was in fact the prophet of a new age, an exclusive player in the ongoing work of Christ's redemption. Olivi described this new age of the Church as sanctified by absolute adherence to the evangelical lifestyle, total and unglossed in its imitation of Christ. Olivi provided historical urgency to the matter of Franciscan reform: the Order as envisioned by Francis was the very embodiment of this new age.<br /><br />Neither the Church nor the leadership of the Order embraced Olivi with particular enthusiasm, but his unmitigated defense of the original Franciscan way was music to the ears of friars who believed they had vowed the Gospel expression of poverty [as then understood by exegetes.]  Burr does not elaborate on day to day living conditions of friars in the early fourteenth century, but it appears that friars of the literalist tradition were subject to ridicule, at the very least, by fellow friars in their convents. Burr does note that the distinctive, short, and evidently ragged habits of the spirituals came in for special ridicule-in one case a spiritual friar found his habit being used in the privy for unintended purposes.<br /><br />Burr analyses the writings of Olivi's successors, Ubertino of Casale and Angelo Clareno, and the efforts of successive popes to come to grips with the spiritualist problem. By the early 1300's the debate over poverty was no longer an intramural affair, unfortunate as that was. Spiritualist friars were having considerable impact upon the laity. As the Inquisition discovered, the lines between spiritualist Franciscans and their lay adherents, on the one hand, and beguins and other spontaneous and unpredictable mystical outcroppings, on the other, were becoming dangerously blurred. In his review of Inquisitorial proceedings, the author discovers a remarkable independence of conscience among the laity accused of associations with heretical Franciscans. Defendants with spunk and courage stood before the Inquisition and refused to recant their respect for friars of strict observance simply on the ecclesiastical assertion that their heroes were heretics. The Reformation, in a sense, had already begun.<br /><br />One might ask if a division of the friars would have been a better solution than persecution. Clement V attempted something along these lines at the Council of Vienne, at least acknowledging the validity of spiritualist concerns. This was, after all, a matter of conscience. Spirituals of good will genuinely believed that they had vowed before God to observe strict poverty in matters of ownership and lifestyle. The Achilles heel of their belief, however, was the corollary that no pope could mitigate this obligation. The second corollary was that the mainstream Order was living in a state of spiritual disobedience to Francis and, ultimately, to Christ himself. Thus the Franciscan Order itself never subscribed to the Clement compromise, and no pontiff after Clement would, either. Particularly not the mercurial John XXII.<br /><br />If the spiritualist movement drowned during John XXII's reign, it did nearly take the entire Franciscan boat down with it. John's ruthless assault on the extremes of the spirituals led many in the Church to look more critically at those claiming to be the true Franciscans, the Order itself. If a spirituality of Gospel absolutes was now condemned, just what were mainstream Franciscans living, or more correctly, claiming to live? As Burr observes, secular clergy and Dominicans had seethed for years when Franciscans made their claims to uniqueness while living like everyone else. Their own excesses and arrogance notwithstanding, the spirituals had at least played some role in the development of Franciscan identity and mores in its formative first century.r spontaneous and unpredictable mystical outcroppings, on the other, were becoming dangerously blurred.

To put this catastrophe into perspective, more residents of the continental United States died of the 1918 influenza outbreak than were killed in the stunning tsunami of late 2004-four times as many, to be more precise. Worldwide, guestimates run between 50 million and 100 million fatalities from a disease born and bred in the American heartland. How did it happen? Could it have been prevented? And more importantly, can it happen again?<br /><br />These are the questions tackled by John Barry in his study of a natural calamity that historians on the whole have tended to sidestep. In his 650-page study of Herbert Hoover's 1918 tenure as America's food czar, George Nash devotes exactly two paragraphs to the influenza, identifying it as a foreign [Spanish] plague brought to America's East Coast. Curiously, the 1918 influenza outbreak has been, till now, a primarily oral tradition. When my doctor's receptionist noticed the book under my arm, she quickly blurted out: \\"My grandmother lost all her hair during the plague.\\" My mother told me that her father had nearly died.<br /><br />Barry begins with a lengthy analysis of medical research and practice after the Civil War. In general, the average American doctor was poorly educated. Some did not have high school diplomas. One Ivy League medical school rejected a proposal for written comprehensive exams on the grounds that many of its students could not read or write. Research was scattered at best. Barry describes the opening of Johns Hopkins University in 1876, an institute founded precisely to address the glaring absence of cutting edge medical research. But its heroes would labor in obscurity for many years.<br /><br />Thus, valuable information about immunology and virology was not available in 1918 as an innocuous strain of influenza passed from birds to humans in Kansas, mutating in the process to something far more terrifying. Barry's description of virology is remarkably clear and precise for the layman. [One is struck at how biological viruses and computer viruses are similar.] A virus by its nature is in constant flux, mutating as its environment dictates. It is an invader, reprogramming normal cells to do its bidding. In this case, the new task was a disarming of the immune system in the respiratory tract. A denuded respiratory tract thus left a patient vulnerable to pneumonia, the primary killer in this biological holocaust.<br /><br />The plague actually struck twice [with aftershocks for about three years]. The first wave, the Kansas outbreak next to an army base, was highly virulent and often fatal. But the second wave, six months later, a mutated form, attacked a population weakened by the first round. Scientists were divided on strategy: isolate the influenza virus itself, or develop a vaccine for pneumonia. They had some success with the latter, and virtually none with the former. What they did agree upon was the highly contagious nature of the disease and the importance of an informed populace.<br /><br />But here the virus found a veritable political petri dish. Having taken years to decide, Woodrow Wilson led America into World War I with unmitigated ruthlessness. To call attention to a disease that was beginning to ravage stateside army cantons and large cities was seen as a dangerous, subversive distraction from the national war effort. Thus national censorship prohibited newspapers from calling attention to appalling death rates or even to health advisories about public gatherings. Despite pleas from scientists, war bond rallies went on as scheduled.  Barry argues that the news embargo increased panic and made a bad situation worse.<br /><br />The disease itself did not look like influenza to most contemporaries, and even today's readers will justifiably wonder if this plague was of a kind with the \\"flu\\" normally encountered in the winter months. This disease killed swiftly, in some cases in less than a day from onset. The victim became discolored and bled from multiple orifices. Only the wracking cough was the true clinical constant with other forms of influenza.<br /><br />Most city governments were paralyzed by incompetence or, more likely, by the illness itself. Gradually local movements ignored Wilson's executive sanctions. In Philadelphia, particularly hard hit, the Biddle and Drexel families essentially assumed emergency services in conjunction with the Catholic Church and other bodies. Catholic Charities, for example, assumed responsibility for corpse removal, and priests with horse drawn carriages made daily rounds to remove bodies from tenements and other residences. Philadelphia victims were buried in mass graves.<br /><br />Barry describes both the scientific and the emotional components of this tragedy well. Perhaps too much attention was paid to turn-of-the-century cutting edge researchers. Although invaluable to American medicine, scientists had nothing for this virus, nor did the production machinery exist at the time for a mass national vaccination even if they had been successful. One might also argue about the author's preoccupation with Woodrow Wilson's shortcomings, and his belief that the influenza affected Wilson's deliberations at Versailles drifts dangerously close to grassy knoll territory.<br /><br />Has the medical community come to an understanding of the 1918 influenza virus such that history will not repeat itself? Yes and No. Late research has determined that the 1918 virus was encapsulated in a protective coating, like an M&M piece of candy. Why this happened, and how to penetrate this defense, still elude scientists. On the brighter side, better community health, the practice of isolating infected animals and humans [as occurred with the SARS outbreak, for example], improved medical procedures for pneumonia, and a highly developed pharmaceutical industry are all factors which would at least tend toward a mitigation of severity. That said, a mutation similar to the 1918 event would still dwarf the wildest imagination of any biochemical terrorist.er if this plague was of a kind with the \\"flu\\" normally encountered in the winter months.

The material goes considerably beyond the title, as only one chapter actually treats of near earth objects [NEO's] at depth, and I am still confused over the author's distinction between \\"amateur\\" and \\"professional\\" astronomers. With those caveats in mind, \\"Seeing In The Dark\\" is a fine overview of astronomy for those of us who have been out of school awhile and think of Pluto as the edge of the meaningful universe.<br /><br />As a boy I was intrigued by astronomy and at age 10 owned an off-the shelf hand telescope that, in my recollection, simply made the bright stars brighter. I once tried to observe the crescent of Venus through my mother's hand mirror and a magnifying glass. I did get to see the rings of Saturn, finally, through the 8\\" telescope at the Buffalo Museum of Science, and to this day I divide the world into those who have seen that spectacle firsthand and those who haven't. Popular astronomy in the 1950's was lunar and planetary: the supposed canal system of Mars, for example, was still an issue of debate.<br /><br />I lost my interest in the 1960's when astronomy became less optical and more electronic. Real observations and photos of heavenly bodies are egalitarian. Spectroscopic charts, radio waves, radar exploration and the like required time, sophisticated education, and money. Every decade or so something would catch my fancy: Apollo 11, Viking, Pioneer, Hubble, Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, Cassini. But why should an amateur like myself spend money and time at something already being done with more precision at Arecibo in Puerto Rico or Mt. Palomar in California, or from a satellite in space, for that matter?<br /><br />Timothy Ferris argues in so many words that the modern astronomical-industrial complex, so to speak, is too big and too expensive to perform some of the most critical work of present day astronomy. The author provides a plethora of examples, such as planetary weather. Most planets have atmospheres with characteristics not entirely unlike the earth's own. The atmospheres of the large outer planets [and in at least one case, a planetary satellite] have predictable patterns of wind currents and even storms that produce lightning. Mars, we have come to realize, has significant dust storms and seasonal markers. To monitor these systems, however, requires daily observations over months and years. With the crush of competition for seat time for the monster telescopes and the costs involved, such meticulous and time consuming planetary observations are gradually falling into the hands of the dedicated [and exquisitely patient] amateur backyard astronomers. The older, smaller, and midrange telescopes have come into a new age of usefulness, where persistence is of equal value to optical power. And, as the author observes, the marriage of a modest telescope with digital photography, computer controls, and Internet access to professionals, has created a formidable network of information gatherers.<br /><br />Nowhere is the amateur's value of more importance than in the discovery and tracking of NEO's, asteroids whose orbits regularly criss-cross the earth's. Observation of these dangerous bodies and forecast of collisions is extremely difficult for several reasons. NEO's are hard to see [in some instances, at the 29th magnitude], only small tracks of their orbits are currently known, and they are notoriously vulnerable to gravitational influences from the earth, the sun, and even Jupiter. Science has developed a public coding system for risk from each known object, and I would venture a guess that readers will find particular stimulation from Ferris's discussion of the \\"Torino Scale.\\" [As I was reading this work, I checked the day's \\"Torino forecast\\" on NASA's web site, the very day that NASA used a \\"Torino 4\\" rating for the first time, for Asteroid 2004MN4. As this occurred the same day as the Asian tsunami, little or no press coverage was devoted to the event, though astronomers around the world focused on the potential risk of a 2029 collision. The odds for 2004MN4 were downgraded to Torino 1 a few days later.]<br /><br />Suffice to say that NEO's are the \\"high needs child\\" of space observation, and every verifiable observation by an amateur astronomer enables NASA and international tracking systems to add another fraction of certainty to a body's orbit. Ferris intersperses observational details of heavenly bodies with interviews of the men and women who do the observing. His use of the word \\"amateur\\" is stretched like taffy. Some of these unsalaried observers have spent six-figures in outfitting their equipment or, in some cases, pursuing doctorates to expedite their work. Some have walked away from lucrative professions and made wholesale disruptions in personal and family life on behalf of serious stargazing. In some cases \\"amateur\\" does not do justice to what is more appropriately an \\"obsession.\\"<br /><br />Ferris summarizes what we have come to know about planets, stars and galaxies in the past few generations of advanced study. Again, if one has not addressed astronomy systematically since school days, this work is an excellent primer on our current state of understanding the heavens. There is a thorough 25-page appendix that treats of basic stargazing information, including issues of light pollution, choice of equipment, and basic star charts, as well as a summary of periodicals and web sites. I regretted that there are no photos of any kind in the book, so we never get to see with our own eyes the quality of work produced by the amateurs in our communities. Perhaps the author was deliberately setting out to pique our curiosity, for yesterday I found myself investigating the features and price tag of a small telescope at the Brookstone's in my local mall.

Whether it is the obsessive guilt-ridden behavior of Lady MacBeth, or the creeping paranoia of Captain Queeg, a mind gone bad holds a grim but compelling fascination. When another Amazon reviewer asked me my opinion as a psychotherapist about \\"American Psycho,\\" I took on the challenge and diverted from my usual diet of non-fiction. In retrospect, I am compelled to say that this diversion cost me several hours of my life that I will never get back.<br /><br />What we have here is a slice of life of a late twenty-something stockbroker named Patrick Bateman, a first person narrative of life in the Wall Street fast lane. In truth, Bateman tells little about his hours on job; what the reader can glean about his professional career comes only from inference. Bateman has a lot of money, eats out every night at about $200 a plate, and dotes upon his appearance and apparel to a degree that even George Hamilton might find excessive.<br /><br />In fact, the clothes fetish is the first hint that all is not right with Mr. Bateman. The mind-numbing detail of wardrobes is mitigated only by the fact that the Hilfiger line had not yet appeared at the time of publication. Clearly the narrator is manic and compulsive, conditions fueled by voracious amounts of cocaine, alcohol, and Xanax. One other early trait is fear: Bateman and his fellow pre-Enron wolves are desperately afraid of falling from their perches into the hell of home cooking, well brand whiskey, and outlet mall shopping.<br /><br />Through the first quarter of the work the author depicts his subject's anomalies with enough subtlety to make this work at least bearable. But then, with little rhyme or reason, Mr. Bateman morphs from just another annoying jerk in a three-piece suit into a malevolent madman. [Captain Queeg, at least, had his typhoon and his \\"yellow stain\\" episodes.] Evidently the violence perpetrated by the subject upon friend and stranger alike evoked a considerable amount of controversy at the time of the book's release. I too found the violence over the edge, but candor compels me to admit that yes, there are real Patrick Batemans out there somewhere. Ask the folks in Wichita about the \\"BTK\\" cases, for example.<br /><br />To borrow a phrase from \\"Dirty Harry,\\" Bateman kills with such sadistic method because, essentially, he likes it. His cruelties to strangers and down-and-outers are one thing, but his slow and excruciating elimination of his peers-particularly women-is quite another. I do give the author his due that he has created a supporting cast for Bateman of pitiful people who fit the victim mode magnificently. His male associates are socially impotent, greedy, shallow, and incapable of anything akin to genuine relationship. And his women...they whine incessantly. In fact, a better name for this work is \\"American Borderlines,\\" for Ellis has set the women's movement back to about 1890 with his feminine portrayals.<br /><br />As Bateman continues his crusade as a one-man wrecking crew, and as \\"American Psycho\\" tortures its readers for another three hundred pages, the realization came to me that the narrative is pure concoction of Bateman's inner confusion. The account of police involvement is one of many tip-offs: they don't call them \\"NY's Finest\\" for nothing, and the greenest rookie from the academy could have closed this case with the second corpse, and I wish he had. Another nagging question is job performance: how does a guy as unraveled as Bateman ostensibly show up for work-let alone succeed financially-with a major brokerage firm? It is no accident that Ellis never takes us to Bateman's 9 to 5 world.<br /><br />I have seen reviews that hail this book as a hallmark satire of life in the 1980's, and I would have to agree that the author is probably making a statement of sorts. However, it is arrogant to suppose that the 1980's somehow cornered the market on madness, greed, and violence. The only folks who might disagree are precisely the men and women who people Bateman's world. For the rest of us, we are left to debate at the end whether it is worse to be outraged or snookered by Mr. Bateman's \\"exploits.\\" Let's take the bus over to Denny's for dinner in our Target shirts, K-Mart slacks, and Pay-Less shoes to ponder this further.olence.

Suffice to say that this two-volume work is the definitive English treatment of Biblical scholarship on the Passion Narratives. Prescinding a moment from the sacred matter of the study, one has to be impressed with the author's command of Biblical scholarship in several contemporary languages, not to mention the intricacies of ancient Greek, Latin, and Aramaic. He is well versed in the history of Biblical scholarship dating to Jerome and Augustine. Father Brown knows his academic peers, their methodologies, emphases, and biases. He is blunt in his praises and criticisms of others working the field. This work is a tribute to Father Brown's single-minded devotion to his field.<br /><br />The first volume of 900 pages treats of the Gethsemanae events through the condemnation of Christ by Pilate. Brown poses the existence of one or possibly a few distinct and original oral Passion accounts. The Last Supper and the Resurrection accounts are both excluded from this study, as the author believes that the meal with the Twelve and the mysterious empty tomb/apparition accounts come from other distinct early Christian sources. The style is considerably more expository than inspirational, though for such a highly technical work the narrative flow is quite adequate. A reader with little time or theological background might do well to read Father Brown's \\"A Crucified Christ in Holy Week,\\" a 70-page reflection on the author's study of the Passion.<br /><br />Father Brown's work continues the tradition of \\"redaction criticism\\" of the New Testament, perhaps the predominant methodology of the past half-century. Redaction criticism contrasts the four stories of the Christ by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John to discern a particular philosophy or theology of Christ unique to that author or his community. The Matthean Christ, for example, emerges as the New Moses; the Markan Christ as the unique prophet of a new age of forgiveness, etc. There is some subtle development of redaction conclusions in the work at hand. Father Brown does not believe it is possible to identify the Gospel authors with certainty. From a historical vantage point, the best one can say is that the nuclei of the Gospel accounts, including the Passion tradition[s], originated in early Christian circles, somewhere between 30-60 A.D. Father Brown's work tends to smooth or ameliorate what had been sharply defined boundaries between the evangelists. He tends throughout his treatment to pair Mark and Matthew, in gentle opposition to Luke. He even makes attempts to find common ground in Mark and John, something my professors of the early 1970's rarely attempted.<br /><br />Father Brown puts more energy into finding bridges between the Gospel narratives and Hebrew Scripture accounts. Thus he underscores the remarkable cohesion of the Christian tradition of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemanae and the story of David's flight from Jerusalem in 2 Samuel 15ff. If the reader takes the time to examine the 2 Samuel text, the parallels are uncanny. The roots of the Judas character, a covey of conspirators, and a mental/spiritual agony on the Mount of Olives are compiled there. In fact, there are even traces of Jesus' warnings to the Apostles in 2 Samuel 15:14-15. The author concludes that the death of Jesus can be understood only in the context of Jewish history, and that the primitive oral account or accounts of the Passion were formulated with considerable influence from the Hebrew Scripture.<br /><br />The centerpiece of this volume is the judicial action against Jesus. Father Brown establishes that the Sanhedrin owned its maximum responsibility for Jesus' fate, and that likewise Pilate owned his maximum responsibility as well. It was not the Romans who initiated charges against Jesus. Politically speaking, Roman-Jewish relations were as tranquil as they had ever been or ever would be. Any idea that Jesus was prosecuted for political subversion is dismantled. Pilate's condemnation was an unusualbut not unheard of acquiescence to the wishes of the Sanhedrin.<br /><br />On the contrary, Jesus died for religious reasons, specifically issues of Jewish theology and practice. The Sanhedrin did not wish to crucify Jesus for doing kindly deeds or attracting crowds. Rather, it was Jesus' powerful rebuke of the contemporary practice of temple-based Jewish life and worship that placed a cross upon the shoulders of the Christ. There is a progression of prophetic criticism from Jesus' lips of legalism, ritualism, casuistry, exclusivity, and spiritual malaise in all four Gospel biographies. Earlier in Jesus' ministry the rebukes seemed to hold forth the hope that current Jewish practice could be reformed. But on the eve of Passover, Jesus' prediction that he himself could destroy the Temple and raise it in three days constituted wholesale blasphemy as heard by Jewish elders. For as Father Brown implies, Jewish leaders who heard this declaration understood it more clearly than later Christians who interpreted it metaphorically. [Recall Matthew's remark that at the moment of his death the curtain of the Holy of Holies-the heart of the cult-was rent from top to bottom.] Jesus was indeed testifying that the Temple cult was dead. Obviously, this kind of thinking and preaching was untenable and demanded the strongest of responses.<br /><br />Father Brown has never in his lengthy career felt restrained by Jewish sensitivities to water down his belief that the Sanhedrin is primarily responsible for Jesus' death. But neither has any scholar of my acquaintance gone to greater pains to underscore the existential nature of Jesus' condemnation: it was this Sanhedrin, at this point in time, in this political environment that condemned Jesus. The author sharply condemns any broader generalizations of an anti-Semitic nature. It is true, however, that the author's works on the community of the Evangelist John tend to elaborate sufferings of later Christian communities at the hands of their former Jewish comrades in faith. Does this point of view influence Father Brown's treatment of the Sanhedrin in this work? Good scholars may argue this point, but no one can disagree that Father Brown has done his homework. In spades.an unusual but not unheard of acquiescence to the wishes of the Sanhedrin. <br /> <br />On the contrary, Jesus died for religious reasons, specifically issues of Jewish theology and practice.

He noted the roar of heavy guns coming from his east, over a nearly four hour time frame. He could see no ships, no smoke, and no indications of hostile military action. One can only imagine his later shock at discovering the source of these mysterious sounds: the volcanic destruction of the Island of Krakatoa, fully 2968 miles to the east, roughly the same distance between Philadelphia and San Francisco. [p. 260]<br /><br />By author Simon Winchester's reckoning, there have been only five geologic explosions of the magnitude of Krakatoa in the history of the planet, and he can barely contain his pleasure that one [thankfully, only one] of these events took place in our lifetime, relatively speaking. For indeed this is one of the compelling facets of the work, the availability of modern communications and scientific instrumentation and their role in both reporting and deciphering the event. Transoceanic telegraph lines, seismographs, motorized shipping, and barometers all play invaluable roles in this work.<br /><br />Before rushing into superlatives about the magnitude and destructiveness of the explosion, a word about this literary genre. \\"Disaster stories\\" present the historian with particular problems. Cataclysms occur in a context. An author must strike a balance between an inadequate set-up and a distracting one. In his splendid history of the Johnstown Flood, David McCullough devotes about 40% of his text to the build-up of the actual catastrophe, which gives the reader the added opportunity of making informed \\"before and after\\" assessments.<br /><br />Winchester places the final paroxysm of Krakotoa over 50% of the way into his work. Admittedly, this is a substantial \\"set-up\\" but for this circumstance a justifiable one. Before the molten Armageddon the author takes us on a detailed, insightful, humorous and colorful journey through several centuries of Dutch colonization of Indonesia, the biological curiosities of the region, and of course the underground politics of the earth's crust. The author's explanation of plate tectonics-the movements of continental pieces that ultimately cause the earthquakes and volcanic eruptions at the earth's surface-is worthy of special note. It is surprising to learn that the major forces of the earth's crust are down, and not up, and that certain regions of the oceans' shorelines are particularly vulnerable to tectonic instability. For the 35,000 or more residents of Java and elsewhere who lost their lives to the explosion, this is a regrettable geographic reality.<br /><br />Krakatoa itself suffered a bad reputation long before the 1883 denouement. One of a string of islands that borders the Sudra Strait in the Dutch East Indies, its volcanic unpredictability was well known-and at times quite visible-to the more populous trade centers of Java and Sumatra. Winchester observed that the island was generally avoided and in 1883 uninhabited. By the few descriptions extant, and present-day photos of its sister islands, Krakatoa reminds the reader of that unnamed island in the 1930's film \\"King Kong.\\"<br /><br />But the desolation of Krakatoa was the exception more than the rule. The territories of the Dutch East Indies were generally farmed for spices and other produce. International commerce was strong during the Dutch hegemony, the Sudra Strait a veritable highway of commerce. By 1883 international telegraph service had reached Java. The Dutch appear to have created European cultural enclaves in their major outpost cities, blissfully unaware that resentment toward them by a devoted Islamic population was brewing into its own volcano of sorts. Winchester has a touch for the subtleties of colonial life, including the visit of a world famous circus to Batavia, on the mainland across from Krakatoa. The circus's baby elephant, for some reason smuggled into a suite of an elegant hotel, became unnerved, apparently by earth tremors, and destroyed the suite. The circus's liability would become a moot point in less than twelve hours.<br /><br />How massive was the Krakatoan blast? It created a tsunami that killed tens of thousands in Southeast Asia. Incredibly it then continued across the Indian Ocean, around Africa, and maintained measurable status as far as the English Channel. The explosion created an atmospheric shock wave that circled the earth seven times, clearly measurable in observatories at Greenwich and Toronto, among other sites. The dust thrown into the atmosphere altered atmospheric colorings for months and produced a unique genre of painting. A fire department in the Hudson Valley of New York State scurried toward a forest fire which proved to be a lighting effect from an unusual red sunset. No one denies the decades old assertion that Krakatoa was the loudest noise in the history of mankind.<br /><br />The explosion of Krakatoa delivered considerable seismic shocks to the scientific and religious communities as well. Those who lived through the terror in Sumatra and Java tended to read apocalyptic significance into the event. Muslims, in particular, interpreted Krakatoa as a call to religious and national purity, and the resulting renewal quickly erupted into armed revolt against the Dutch. Scientists, on the other hand, would be intrigued when a new island, Anak Krakatoa, arose over the original site in 1930. Anak, along with defoliated sister islands of the old Krakatoa, became a source of intense fascination as a kind of biological clean slate, and development of vegetative and animal life was charted with considerable interest, unfortunately interrupted by World War II and later by political instability in Indonesia. Forests and wildlife rapidly propagated through airborne spores and simple swimming of species from the mainland. In his last chapter the author describes a very recent visit to Anak Krakatoa, now highly rugged and volcanically active. The sacrifice of his picnic lunch to an aggressive monitor lizard convinces author and reader alike that the Krakatoan legacy is very much alive.some reason smuggled into a suite of an elegant hotel, became unnerved, apparently by earth tremors, and destroyed the suite.

US	52709329	RFCLNDP0UPYJ5	1893554619	515013838	America's Bishop: The Life and Times of Fulton J. Sheen	Books	5	28	35	N	Y	A Brilliant Cleric: He Told Us So Himself	Fulton J. Sheen will never be canonized a saint in the Roman Catholic Church for two obvious reasons: his sins are bright scarlet and we know them too well. Sheen established a television intimacy with the American public in the 1950's that only a few individuals have achieved-Walter Cronkite and Johnny Carson come to mind-through his apostolic use of that explosive new video medium. I was a lad in Catholic elementary school when Sheen delivered his prime time homilies from 1952 through 1957. While I remember little of the content of those shows, I was captivated by the style. Sheen, I noticed, paused to let the audience think. None of my local priests did that, nor did they have Skippy the angel to erase the blackboard.<br /><br />Thomas Reeves is to be commended for the manner in which he tells the truth, the whole truth, about Sheen without defacing the Bishop's many good works and his positive influence upon a wide and diverse American public. Sheen's life was indeed a message \\"written with crooked lines\\" and one is reminded of Christ's words to the penitent woman, \\"her sins, many as they are, will be forgiven because of her great love.\\" Though haunted by the pride and ambition that would seem to stalk nearly all television evangelists who followed, in the final analysis Sheen did love his God, though he himself ran a close second.<br /><br />Born in 1895 on a farm in rural Illinois, the youthful Peter John Sheen was devout, smart, and disdainful of manual labor and farming. He was hardly the first country boy to see the cloth as a step up from shoveling manure. We forget that he was originally a priest of the Peoria, Illinois, diocese, possibly because of his distinguished academic record at the Louvain.<br /><br />There is an air of mystery about Sheen's academic status, though. Desperate to escape a life in Peoria, Sheen joined the philosophy faculty of Catholic University in 1926 but never became \\"one of the boys\\" of the staff. In fact, tenure was denied him for some years, in part because the young priest was away from the campus three days a week for his growing number of speaking engagements. [In 1928 he hired a clipping service to track his press notices.] Catholic University itself was in academic, political, and organizational disarray. The school was frankly under-funded and underachieving. Perhaps to ease himself out of the philosophy department and into theology, Sheen invented for himself a second doctorate, an S.T.D. that suddenly appeared after his name in 1928 and which remained on his letterhead as late as 1966. Reeves speculates that Sheen got away with this massive deception precisely because it was so audacious and no one would have expected it of him.<br /><br />Reeves wonders if Sheen is under-appreciated today as a scholastic. Although brilliant and prolific, Sheen was not original, and added nothing of substance to twentieth century philosophy.  Sheen's strength was apologetics: the presentation of Catholic faith and devotion in simple, straightforward, and yet cosmopolitan ways. For about forty years, from 1928 through 1966, Sheen was arguably the best preacher in the United States, dividing his time between public appearances, radio and television, prodigious devotional writing, and fundraising for the Society of the Propagation of the Faith [and, surprisingly, acting as an \\"observer\\" of sorts for J. Edgar Hoover, who admired his fierce anti-communism.] His work for the Society earned him the title bishop, appointed auxiliary to Cardinal Francis Spellman of New York in 1951. Reeves finds that Sheen was a holy priest who made a daily holy hour before the Blessed Sacrament and spent hours personally instructing converts, including numerous celebrities of the entertainment and publishing industries.<br /><br />Having said that, it cannot be denied that Sheen shocked his clerical brethren with a champagne lifestyle. While a faculty member at CU Sheen built a magnificent home in NW D.C.and entertainedfrequently and graciously. As a fund-raiser, millions of dollars passed through his hands, though there is no whiff of impropriety. Reeves does comment upon Sheen's total absence of fiscal management skill, his arrogance and petulance that insulated him from sound advice, his unfettered cash charity, and his pride of bestowal, so to speak. These factors, coupled with Spellman's own devils, led to an estrangement between the two that produced one of the strangest episcopal appointments of our lifetime.<br /><br />In October 1966 Fulton Sheen was appointed bishop of Rochester, NY. To church observers it was clear that Spellman had orchestrated the transfer for ultimate humiliation effect. In public, at least, Sheen put the best face on things, explaining that his tenure would be an experiment with the reforms of the recently concluded Vatican II. In truth, Sheen was a pre-Vatican II autocrat who alienated nearly every local constituency. His unilateral decision making cost him his priests, and his explicit criticisms of racial policies at Kodak the support of the city's largest employer. He was deeply wounded that Rochester did not recognize the celebrity in its midst, and within three years \\"America's best preacher\\" withered into retirement.<br /><br />If the Rochester years were his crucifixion, they also brought Sheen into communion with his best self. In retirement he publicly regretted his earlier opulence and vanity. He became less dogmatic and more open to philosophical systems other than that of St. Thomas Aquinas. Although not entirely shedding his theatrical instincts, he lived the last of his 84 years with an optimistic piety that belied the sufferings of multiple illnesses. Appropriately, he was found dead in his private chapel. Throughout this remarkable life, with its graces and glosses, Sheen's prayers were always sincere. His arrogance and sense of self-importance are perhaps the less desirable fruits of his utter certainty in the truth and goodness of God and the holiness of the Roman Catholic Church.entertained frequently and graciously.

For all the grim realities chronicled by the author, the reader experienced a grotesque curiosity in following Hitler's improbable ascent to power and the unfolding of personal, national, and international events that made his ascent possible.<br /><br />Volume two continues the excellence of research and writing, but it is not a tonic for the soul. On the contrary, \\"Nemesis\\" is a scholarly apocalypse of the degradation of human life. While it is very possible that many readers will be more familiar with the events of this volume, most will probably be revolted to see just how inhumane the Third Reich really was. Although this work is generally free of polemic, it is safe to venture that author Ian Kershaw would like those who romanticize the Third Reich or present day neo-Nazi youthful idiocy to get a craw full of the real thing.<br /><br />Kershaw's treatment of Hitler's involvement in the Holocaust reveals a dictator who is crazy like a fox. The author's careful examination of Hitler's orchestration of this abomination reveals a calculating mind and the rather extraordinary measures he took to lead his nation, and particularly his intimate advisors in all compartments of government, down the slippery slope to inevitable genocide. For all of Goebbels' carefully orchestrated anti-Semitic propaganda, Kershaw observed that there is no executive order, no speech, and no document, in which Der Fuhrer explicitly orders mass deaths of Jews. The Holocaust in effect began in the mid-1930's, through discriminatory laws and more significantly the intimidation and violence quietly encouraged and judicially tolerated among Nazi youth thugs. Those eager to do their leader's will believed they had a free hand from Hitler to do with the Jews as they wished, and of course in this they were correct.<br /><br />According to Kershaw Hitler realized that open genocide would not only bring world condemnation but would probably not be accepted even by a nation that hailed him. Thus, he was careful not to establish concentration and extermination camps where they would be obvious to Germans, specifically, in Germany. Rather, the grim business of detention and mass execution was centered in Poland after its conquest. Nor did Hitler originally envision the cold-blooded gassing and crematories of the death camps. Hitler's utopia, if it can be called that, was more complex and quite surprising, even for a man like Hitler.<br /><br />Throughout both volumes Kershaw goes to considerable pains to elaborate one of Der Fuhrer's most significant ruminations, his perception that Germany did not have enough \\"living space.\\" This is a critical piece of the puzzle, for it explains what would appear to be madness of his foreign and military policy, particularly in the later years of the Reich. To be sure, Hitler wished to reclaim what had been lost in World War I, and in these efforts he enjoyed universal support from the citizenry and the military. Restoration, after all, made perfect sense.<br /><br />But having accomplished this, Hitler's vision of the future was evidently something that few citizens truly understood, nor did they feel it worth the horrible sacrifice of human life and civilization invested in making it come true. Hitler envisioned a new Germany extending well into western Russia and the Balkans. He would then have the space to expand his country as well as oil and natural resources into virtual perpetuity. His plan went on to a relocation of western Russian citizenry further to the east, and beyond that to relocating European Jews to Siberia, where he expected them to die. [He had briefly considered Madagascar for similar abominable purposes.] This vision of the future explains the dilemma that every schoolboy has pondered for sixty years: why attack Russia and fight a two-front war?<br /><br />Russia would eventually drive the Germans back at horrible cost to both nations. Hitler's megalomania prevented him from accepting advice from his generals, who recommended strategic withdrawals from time to time to reduce casualties and to regroup forces. For the last three years of the war Hitler lived in his famous \\"Wolf's Lair,\\" a private war camp in East Prussia, for the express purpose of directing the eastern war front himself. As his geographic utopian plans crumbled, the execution of Jews by direct methods in the camps accelerated. Hitler seemed to know what international reaction to his genocidal conduct might be, and he used this insight to enmesh his generals and advisors in the full knowledge and concurrence of the camp activities as a deterrent to defection to the West, as Rudolf Hess had done in 1941.<br /><br />The German public rarely saw Hitler once the Russian war began, primarily because he would have very little good news to report once Moscow regrouped. Entire years would go by without so much as a radio broadcast. Thus, what Germans saw of their government were primarily war casualties, material deprivation, and police state intimidation. Gradually they emotionally rejected him, though public demonstrations against him were rare. Hitler, for his part, grew to despise the German citizenry as weak and undeserving of his talents. In 1944 he narrowly escaped death when a bomb, planted by a staff officer, exploded within several feet of him. More paranoid than ever after this attack, Hitler trusted basically no one and the rotation of officers and advisors began to take on the trappings of comic opera. Even his last day, marked by marriage to Eva Braun, was surreal. Kershaw was able to take advantage of recent access to Russian war archives to clarify many, if not all, the questions surrounding the death of Hitler and the disposition of his corpse, fittingly and ironically cremated.ttack Russia and fight a two-front war?  <br /> <br />Russia would eventually drive the Germans back at horrible cost to both nations.

A 1954 Brooklyn boy improbably becomes a \\"bonus baby\\" with his hometown Dodgers. So wild and unpredictable a hurler, his manager dreaded to use him. He labors six years but never loses faith. Suddenly, in 1961, the fidelity of this Dodger Job is redeemed. He rolls off six years of impeccable performance that earn him a berth in the Hall of Fame. To paraphrase Ecclesiastes, there is a time for everything, including premature retirement when a left arm becomes irreparably damaged. And then he disappears to a privacy of his own doing.<br /><br />This is an interesting work that features memory and impression over sabermetrics. Koufax did win eleven games in 1958; he was not exactly a stiff before 1961. And if one looks at the stats closely, he was not that far from his peers even at his best: in his memorable six-season span, 1961-1966, he bested Juan Marichal in wins by a slim 129-124 margin and Don Drysdale by 129-111. [Marichal would win another 113 after Koufax retired.] Thus, the difference between Koufax and his peers like Marichal, Bob Gibson, and Drysdale must lie elsewhere than in sheer statistics. Jane Levy seeks to find that \\"otherness,\\" focusing upon the atmosphere of postwar Brooklyn, the influence of Judaism upon the pitcher, and the mixed emotions of Koufax and his admirers alike when the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles. Leavy captures what stats guru Bill James uses as the ultimate criterion for admission to the Hall of Fame: his contemporaries thought of Koufax as the best at his position.<br /><br />Koufax's career covered twelve years, much shorter than Marichal's or Warren Spahn's. In retrospect, however, he seemed to have pitched in two different eras of the game. In those grainy black and white films of the 1955 World Series, when Dodger outfielder Sandy Amoros started the mother of all double plays near the left field foul line, a very young Koufax watched from the Dodger bench. He was there the next year to see Larsen's perfect game; he moved with the team to Los Angeles; he pitched in the Coliseum with its \\"Wally Moon home run porch\\" and was a member of the 1959 World Series Championship team, posting an 8-6 season record. Aside from winning big in the 1960's, he and Drysdale attempted the first \\"collective bargaining\\" strategy and started the ball rolling for Curt Flood and Marvin Miller.<br /><br />Amazingly during his Brooklyn high school days Koufax was not considered prospective baseball material, and certainly not a pitcher. His sport, ironically, was basketball, and on February 10, 1953, Koufax and his Lafayette High School five [which included a scrappy Alan Dershowitz] embarrassed a New York Knicks team paced by Harry \\"The Horse\\" Gallatin and Al McGuire. He might never have attempted organized baseball were it not for a serendipitous encounter with one Milt Laurie, Braves' prospect turned truck driver. Laurie was impressed with the speed of Koufax's delivery, if not his control, and eased him into the world of Brooklyn amateur baseball. Later, at the University of Cincinnati, baseball coach Ed Jucker [yes, that Ed Jucker, better known for his coaching on hardwood floors.] complained that none of his catchers would go near Koufax for fear for life or limb. It is unclear who among the Dodger organization first caught sight of Koufax-though Walter Alston had seen him play basketball at Cincinnati-Al Campanis appears to have spearheaded the recruiting and signed the lefty.<br /><br /> Koufax, as Leavy observed, came to the Dodgers at roughly the same time as Alston. The latter's conservative and basic outlook on the game was never quite at peace with the unpredictable Koufax. Their relationship was tense. Leavy overstates the case when she argues that Alston was flat out afraid to use him-Koufax started 25 games in 1958-but she is correct that the Dodger organization did not know how to manage him. As a result, Koufax developed his unique windup and delivery pretty much on his own. Leavy devotes an entire chapter to his delivery, including kinetic sketches--admirable until one realizes that this very delivery nearly destroyed his left arm. When the reader considers how Leo Mazzoni has nurtured flame-thrower John Smoltz through near twenty profitable seasons, the tragedy of Koufax's shortened career comes into clearer focus.<br /><br />The Koufax who emerges here is neither a philosopher nor a religious fanatic. He is a competitive but sociable Brooklynite who never totally succumbed to West Coast glitz nor corporate Dodger hubris. His reserve is a genuine humility, a reluctance to trade in on what he considered a physical ability, and should not be confused with the darker shadows of DiMaggio. He was loved by his teammates, and respected [and feared] by the opposition. Thanks to Leavy's extensive search for Koufax contemporaries, there is a plethora of anecdotal material from Ron Fairly, Ken Holtzman, Nate Oliver, Jeff Torborg, Maury Wills, Wes Parker, and Ed Vargo, to name a few. The ultimate in nostalgia is Leavy's reconstruction over nine chapters of Koufax's perfect game of September 9, 1965. Pieced together from a scouting film, a boy's tape recording of the radio broadcast, and memories of the participants, Leavy recounts one of baseball's greatest pitching duels, between the perfect Koufax and the near perfect Bob Hendley of the Cubs. It is proof positive that the Koufax era was an experience that lifted all boats in the tide of competition.did not know how to manage him.

In this work we get the martyr's revenge: from an articulate, scholarly, and dismayed author who administers a death by a thousand cuts to the premises and biases of the best selling \\"Da Vinci Code.\\"<br /><br />There are many ways this antidote to DVC could have been mishandled: the author could have written an ad hoc attack upon Dan Brown, or a cosmic wail against the anti-Catholic bias of the work, or a \\"preaching to the choir\\" methodology of uncritical defense of those areas of Catholic life and history that Brown played upon so well. The author successfully avoided these pitfalls, for the most part, with a terse but thorough dismantling of the major historical and theological flaws. Welborn, who did her graduate history studies at Vanderbilt University, clearly holds the upper hand.<br /><br />The author addresses about a dozen topics that DVC manhandles with distressing consistency: the identity of Mary Magdalene, the determination of the canon or texts of the New Testament, the Roman Emperor Constantine, the Holy Grail, Leonardo Da Vinci, feminism in the Church, mystery religions, and Opus Dei. Each separate critique is deadly to a novel which depends upon an intricately developed puzzle. It would require only a few threads to unravel before the plot line becomes irrational. Welborn works with a tailor's shears. To cite just one area of critique, Welborn devotes a chapter to Brown's depiction of Da Vinci himself, and discovers that the moniker \\"Da Vinci\\" is not the artist's name. He was known then, and to experts today, as Leonardo. For those familiar with the story line of DVC, such a corrective makes quite a mess out of the intricate maze of word clues that Sophie Neveu seems to revel in.<br /><br />I cannot find the exact word to describe the author's literary style, but it is distinctive. At this point in her career I get the sense that her avocation is the communication of \\"Catholic common sense.\\" It does help the reader to know that Welborn is the author of a successful series of religious works for Catholic high school students, traditionally a notoriously difficult audience; and her blog site, \\"Open Book,\\" is a daily watering hole for Catholics across the country that rivals Chris Matthews for hardball repartee. Welborn's avowed literary inspiration has long been the take-no-prisoners Flannery O'Connor, who would probably have weighed in herself on DVC, were she alive today.<br /><br />At times I felt the author was almost annoyed that she had to do this book, disconcerted that basic tenets of Catholic history were unknown to so many readers of her faith, or that a best seller with such historical and theological flaws could go unchallenged. But in the final analysis, Welborn wrote this work because, in her own words, \\"culture matters,\\" [p. 20] and she is correct. To pretend that music, art, literature, and film do not have agendas and influence is naive. Recently it has come to light that much of the technology employed by investigators on the popular television series CSI [Las Vegas and Miami, presumably] does not exist in real crime labs. Real life prosecutors are having difficulty making cases because juries expect levels of technical evidence they have come to expect on television. And I trusted Gil Grissom and Horatio Cane.

There are a number of well-documented reasons why this deviation from a healthy diet is not good for you, but those creme-filled chocolate frosted beauties are just so, so delicious. The same is true of DVC. Despite its factual errors and polemic slant, it is a deliciously intriguing read. I suppose there are many worse ways to be naughty.<br /><br />I would venture to guess that the plot line of this work is generally known: a secret society of European men of science and letters keeping alive an alternative account of the final destiny of Jesus Christ. This secret, so remarkable, has the power to turn traditional Christianity on its head. The villains of the piece are the Roman Catholic Church, whose whole existence in this work has been dedicated to suppressing the secret, and specifically Opus Dei-or a fringe element of the group, at least-which will resort to all sorts of murder and mayhem to obtain the final, conclusive key to the puzzle. Despite the theme of nearly timeless entities, the book moves along with the pace of a \\"24\\" episode and covers roughly a twenty-four hour span of time.<br /><br />What spoil an otherwise excellent read are two factors: the first is the targeting of the Catholic Church and Opus Dei. Every work needs heroes and villains, but I found the Catholic bashing excessive. Brown plays on two current Catholic controversies-a male, clerically based structure of governance and scholarship, and its corollary, the second place status of women, real or imagined, to gain the reader's approbation that yes, Catholicism is quite capable of a fraud the likes of which Brown describes.<br /><br />Secondly, Brown's research is eclectic, selective, and often just wrong. A veritable cottage industry of corrective works has recently appeared on bookshelves in recent months. A reasonably knowledgeable reader will easily spot the more egregious errors; a theologian, historian, or art critic will have a field day. The particular difficulty here is that Brown's puzzle is so delicately intertwined that if even one or two strands are defective, the entire weave becomes highly suspect.<br /><br />To someone yet to read this work, I would simply say that you are facing the doughnuts for supper dilemma. You'll probably love it, so long as you don't mind the heartburn in the morning.rors; a theologian, historian, or art critic will have a field day.

It is hard to conceive of anyone who has influenced American life, foreign policy, and human sensitivities more than Hitler in our own times. There are past and prospective readers of this work who fought the War that he essentially started and fueled, and very few American families are untouched by his legacy of destruction.<br />Given his place in history, detested as that may be, it would be hard to cite a better biographical sketch of Der Fuhrer than that of Professor Ian Kershaw of the University of Sheffield in England. We all know that Hitler was bad. Kershaw takes us for a two-volume excursion that explains, as well as anyone can, how he became bad and how his evil was allowed to ferment, verily to thrive, when others in power could have squashed him.<br />The first volume traces Hitler's life up to and including the German reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1937, a daring but bloodless military foray that left both the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations in tatters. One might suspect that Hitler's flaunting of international law might have been halted midstream by the appropriate checks and balances of German government, business, the military and popular opinion. Obviously, this did not happen. The genius of this volume, in my view, is Kershaw's penetrating analysis of the national conditions of German life and politics that carried Hitler's agenda to fruition, at ultimately terrible cost.<br />Alois Schicklgruber changed his name to Alois Hitler in 1876, thirteen years before the birth of his son Adolf in 1889. [Heil Schicklgruber?] There are hints in \\"Mein Kampf\\" and other sources that Adolf Hitler's overbearing mother was unable to protect him from his father's physical outbursts of anger, though materially the family was comfortable. His secondary school reports describe him as an unmotivated underachiever, and he seems to have left formal schooling with enthusiasm only for history. In his late teens and early adult years Hitler lived an existence described by Kershaw as \\"parasitic idleness,\\" drawing from inheritances and fancying himself an artist. In actuality he was refused admission on multiple occasions to institutes of advanced artistic training.<br />When his money ran out, Hitler gravitated to Vienna and painted postcards. He was something of a beer hall bum who worked only enough to survive in a public shelter and pontificate with other down and outers on issues of the day. Kershaw describes in vivid detail the social and political currents of Austria at the time. Nostalgic/apocalyptic pan-Germanic dreams, anti-Semitism, quirky eugenics theories, an uneven economy, and general frustration with ineffectual bureaucratic government led to the rise of energetic but scattered right wing political movements prior to World War I. Bombarded by but very congenial to such influences, Hitler's political philosophy of German preeminence began to form, and the outbreak of international hostilities seemed to galvanize and energize him.<br />Hitler volunteered for military service in Munich [though legally he was required to do so in Austria and barely escaped prison.] He served primarily as a messenger to the front lines, an unglamorous but respectable tour of duty, and at one point he was temporarily blinded in the line of duty. After hostilities ceased, a thoroughly demoralized Hitler was ordered to work as a teacher in a program to indoctrinate German soldiers to the dangers of Bolshevism, now a major threat to Germany's east in the wake of the Russian Revolution. In actuality such indoctrination was a closet rallying of German nationalism in the military under the restrictions of Versailles. Hitler surprised himself, and many of his influential superiors, with his rhetorical prowess. Throwing his lot with the German Workers Party, a collection of right wingmilitarists/socialists, Hitler gained national recognition as a spokesman of discontent with the economy and post war shame. His message was hardly unique, though-72 other such parties crowded for influence.<br />In 1921 he became his own party's leader, and in this capacity led a 1923 ill-timed and poorly conceived revolt against the sitting Reich government known today as the \\"Beer Hall Putsch\\" [named for its place of proclamation, not conception.] Kershaw examines the Putsch as a prime example of the way that Hitler himself was used by discontented men of influence from a variety of interest groups. By rights the Putsch should have cost Hitler his life-a treasonous act that killed several. But before a sympathetic judge, Hitler used his trial-with the judge's compliance-as a national podium to articulate his vision of a reformed and restored Germany. Here he broke ahead of the pack of other like-minded rivals for national influence. He received a ludicrously brief prison sentence in quarters that allowed him to write, receive and entertain guests, and continue to expand his political influence. After release, he was banned from speaking for a time [outdoors!] Any chance to beard the lion by the state was now lost forever.<br /><br />Hitler's nationalist party, easily the loudest of Germany's political parties in the early 1930's, never captured more than a third of the popular vote, but on January 30, 1933, with Hindenburg's government in crisis, Hitler himself wrangled the position of Chancellor, second only to Hindenburg. Upon Hindenburg's death in 1934 he seized full control of the government, with the help of extensive street violence and a propaganda machine second to none. Immensely popular with the masses, he embraced wholesale rearmament and survived the resulting economic upheaval by the dramatic Rhineland venture.<br />Kershaw discusses Hitler's notorious anti-Semitism at considerable length, though at the conclusion of this first volume there are no clear indications of the genocide that lie ahead. Hitler spoke of segregation and exportation of Jews in private and public addresses and diplomatic meetings through 1937. The death camps, with many other horrors, were not in focus just yet.ing militarists/socialists, Hitler gained national recognition as a spokesman of discontent with the economy and post war shame.

US	52709329	R2CLFSCTI3GLLT	0809138107	669907351	Nil Sorsky: The Complete Writings (Classics of Western Spirituality)	Books	5	27	28	N	N	A Spiritual Army of One	That Nil Sorsky's name is enmeshed in the extremely complex matrix of religious and political forces of sixteenth century Russia is no harbinger of the man or his writings. If anything, Sorsky's spiritual heritage was something of a counterbalance to the Russian fever to restore religious and political eminence vis-&agrave;-vis Renaissance Europe. Sorsky was an old-school monastic who favored an individualistic, isolated, and rustic lifestyle as an option to highly visible and influential monasteries associated with the other charismatic monk-writer of his time, Joseph Volotsky.<br />In his preface John Mina provides a brief but useful sketch of the struggles of Byzantine Christianity dating roughly to the Fourth Crusade in which western Roman Catholic forces seized the holy city of Constantinople. Only a generation later the Khan dynasty laid waste Russian cities and their sacred institutions. This multiple destruction from west and east appears to have had something of an apocalyptic effect upon Russian Christians-their Babylonian exile, so to speak-and sparked a revival ripe for intensive penance and mystical experience known in that part of the world as \\"hesychasm.\\" As Mina explains it, hesychasm was a spirituality of strength born from the power of the closeness of God. It was not a monastic feature per se, but permeated all aspects of Christian life, including art and politics. Not unexpectedly over the years there were many Russians for whom hesychasm was an inadequate response to the indignities inflicted by western Catholicism and who saw this highly spiritualized way of life as out of step with the humanism of the Renaissance.<br />It is at this sixteenth century juncture that Sorsky and his writings became a post mortem rallying point against a growing triumphalism that infected the Russian Church and, apparently, most monasteries as well. About his personal life surprisingly little is known. He may have been born in Moscow, and as a young man had the good fortune to enter a strict monastery and receive excellent formation around the writings of Symeon the New Theologian, John Climacus, Gregory of Sinai, and Nil of Sinai. Sorsky would also spend time at the famous Mt. Athos center of monastic spirituality during his formative years. It is little wonder that, with his own idealism and an excellent formation behind him, Sorsky's commitment to hesychastic monasticism would blossom into extraordinary devotion.<br />Sorsky's major contribution to Russian monasticism-a gift that regrettably was ultimately discarded-was his insight that full union with God and submission of the passions was a full time mission, best done away from creature comforts and human communion. He founded his skete-a tiny village of sorts consisting of single dwelling huts-on the shores of a brackish river away from the mainstream of city life. As a rule he accepted members who already had formation and service in a larger and more established monastery. It is not hard to imagine that Sorsky's style of skete living was interpreted as a not so subtle rebuke against \\"softer\\" or \\"opportunistic\\" monasteries looking to enhance position within ecclesiastical circles.<br />There is, in fact, a kind of siege mentality to Sorsky's writings here, consisting of his Rule for the monks of the skete and two smaller works, The Tradition, and a collection of letters. Gracefully rendered in translation by Father George Maloney, S.J., world-renowned scholar in Eastern Christian Spirituality, Sorsky emphasized the strength of the devil and the vigilance necessary for the monk to maintain his communion with God. His tone is highly moralistic as he outlines the various ways that the powers of evil work to undermine the soul: through gluttony, fornication, covetousness, anger, sadness, acedia, vainglory, and pride. His commentaries on the vices are fascinating. Acedia, a term foreign to western spirituality, is described in language that suggests a severe depression leading to despair. Sorsky observes that this kind of mood is not unexpected among men who live hard and solitary lives. [p. 80] With regard to fornication, Sorsky advises his monks to \\"keep away from living with youths with effeminate and pretty faces and refrain from looking at them.\\" [p. 77]<br />Primarily his advice is threefold: know when to ask for help, turn to the written word of the great monastic writers, and acquire the skill of praying the appropriate prayer to the spiritual crisis at hand. Sorsky does not envision himself as an innovator; he quotes freely from the Scriptures and monastic writing. If anything he sees himself as protecting a proven spiritual journey handed down from monastic ancestry. He does not dwell upon mystical experience or rewards, in part because his eschatology was more final than real, and in part because of his belief that in the final analysis, with temptations removed, God would care for his men in uniquely personal ways.<br />What does a twenty-first century reader take from this work? My own immediate reaction was awe at the breadth of the Christian tradition. This work is a tonic for parochialism and the blurred boundaries between the Kingdom of God and the Secular City, so to speak. It is something of a slap of cold water on the face, a hard reminder that moral flabbiness and compromise have eternal consequences. In the final analysis, Sorsky's message echoes Christ's words to Pilate, \\"My Kingdom is not of this world.\\" The reader will either feel compelled to look at his own life or succumb to that wretched acedia.ding to despair.

US	52709329	RXEZG6WQHNMG8	0395670292	908326568	Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	Just Another Day At The Office For Jim Lovell	This work will forever carry the blessing and the curse of being joined at the hip to the memorable film rendition, \\"Apollo 13.\\" I gather that in recent years the powers that be have thrown in the towel and now market book and movie under the same name. If memory serves correctly, the book appeared in 1994, the movie in 1995. I have often wondered about the synergy between the two; was \\"Lost Moon\\" written in the knowledge that it would immediately undergo the standard Hollywood facelift, or did Tom Hanks exert \\"go fever\\" upon the authors to meet production deadline? Such questions will no doubt swirl about this fine book into the foreseeable future.<br />As to the content and literary merits of the work itself, a previous Amazon reviewer noted a certain jumpiness in the narrative, forward leaps and backward glances. I agree with that observation. It may be that the Apollo 13 incident took place so long ago--can it really be 33 years already?-that the authors at times came to the realization that most readers under 40 didn't really know Jim Lovell, and that biographical information had to be inserted to explain why this particular astronaut's position as commander of the flight made all the difference in the world to its bloodless outcome.<br />With all due respects to Alan Shepard, John Glenn, and Neil Armstrong-space pioneers in their own right-historians of future generations may look upon Jim Lovell as the most accomplished of the space pioneers of the twentieth century. In April 1970 when he boarded the Odyssey for the flight to the Fra Mauro highlands of the moon, Lovell possessed an impressive resume of space experience, in terms of both seat time and technical experience. In 1965 he had accepted the most undesirable of the Gemini assignments, the fourteen-day marathon of physiological and psychological stress designed to push the envelope of human endurance--with a manned two-craft rendezvous thrown in for good measure. In 1966 he and Buzz Aldrin, in another Gemini craft, finessed the skill of docking and physical adroitness in extravehicular tasking. In 1968, with Frank Borman and Bill Anders, he inaugurated manned flights aboard the new Saturn V rocket and stunned the world with the Christmas circumlunar Apollo VIII. Lovell's history of competence under fire is perhaps the major human element of this work. Who on NASA's active roster of 1971 was better prepared to handle a crisis the magnitude of Apollo XIII?<br />Lovell's history with the space program is much better documented in the book, if awkwardly at times, than in the film. For those unfamiliar with the plot line, Apollo XIII was the third lunar mission, albeit a star-crossed one even before lift-off. Its original crew of Shepard, Mitchell, and Roosa was scrubbed for both health and political reasons involving Shepard's ten year hiatus from active space duty, a piece of history omitted in the book. Later, less than a week before the mission, command module pilot Ken Mattingly was unwittingly exposed to measles and replaced by back-up Jack Swigert. There is some fudging about Mattingly's dismissal from the Apollo XIII crew. In the book Lovell reports that NASA management made the call; in the film Lovell/Hanks replies straightforwardly to Mattingly/Sinese that \\"this was my call.\\" To add to the mystery, a close examination of sources indicates Mattingly was either never interviewed for this work or declined to participate, a curious omission on a matter so germane to the plot.<br />But Apollo XIII was star-crossed in more ways than anyone could have imagined. A design error in the critical fuel cell unit had transformed that equipment into a ticking bomb that exploded 200,000 miles from earth, rendering the mother ship useless and forcing the astronauts to relocate all operations and life support to the tiny Aquarius lunar lander. The technical complications alone for such an untested procedure were staggering; Lovell and collaborator Jeffrey Kluger communicatethese problems with a manageable balance of technology and human drama. Like many other astronaut-authors, Lovell does not overly dwell on the human emotion or physical discomfort of his flight, which involved five days without heat, sleep, or edible food and immense technical improvising under god-awful conditions. The film version depicts considerable tension between Haise and Swigert after the explosion, with Lovell virtually having to separate them from coming to blows.

Shortly after this work was published in 1981 I was engaged in a summer school graduate course on human development at Rollins College. The adjunct professor, an elementary school principal, was highly conversant with the schools and theories discussed by James Fowler in this work at hand. During a break in the ungodly four-hour night class, a student asked the professor if, given the chance to do it over, she would have focused her doctoral efforts in another direction. Without batting an eye, the professor shot back: \\"Oh yes. Pharmacology.\\" To say that a few somnolent students snapped to attention would be a profound understatement. Her message was clear enough: when studying human development, psychological theory is only one leg of the stool.<br />\\"Stages of Faith\\" is the first and perhaps best known work of James Fowler, who is particularly remembered in Roman Catholic circles for his influence upon the structure and content of religious education programs and study books for the young. Fowler himself appears to have been profoundly influenced by the study of Paul Tillich and particularly Richard Niebuhr, about whom the author would produce another book years later. Fowler credits both theologians for their seminal systematic work on the distinction between personal spiritual experience and cultic religious belief. [I did find Fowler's omission of Rudolf Otto's groundbreaking work on religious experience from his primary sources as curious.]<br />The scholarly quest for systematic recognition of personal religious experience was a new venture for mainstream Protestant and Roman Catholic academics. The established theories of human development-notably Piaget and Erikson-provided theologians with something of a language for further theorizing. But I suspect that Lawrence Kohlberg's appearance on the scene was perhaps the flash point for scholars like Fowler. Kohlberg's stages of moral development looked for all the world liked psychological theology and practically begged theologians of all faiths to recouch their thinking on religious experience and faith in a new developmental and epistemological framework.<br />This essentially is what \\"Stages of Faith\\" tries to do, ponderously at times. Fowler attempts to integrate the thinking of Piaget, Erikson, and Kohlberg and apply this synthesis to the religious journeys of adults, one of whom is chronicled extensively toward the end of this work. I wish he had used several more actual biographies. Despite the fact that subject Mary's roller-coaster life brings spice to an otherwise admittedly dry read, it becomes clear immediately that Mary is not \\"typical,\\" so that she becomes a poster child for abnormality. She does not integrate or learn from experience [Piaget], she is dreadfully deficient in meeting age appropriate challenges [Erikson], and her moral reasoning is little more than sensory [Kolhberg]. By the end of the interview Tillich and Niebuhr are at best distant memories. Presumably the merits of a marriage between psychology and theology are in its formative possibilities [hence the great interest in Fowler by Catholic educators and catechists, for example], but Mary regrettably is an indicator of what happens when those opportunities are lost. Our biography here has diagnostic value at best.<br />There is another issue at hand as well, the one raised by my former professor. As I read Mary's case study, I wondered to myself: how would this scattered woman's life be different were she taking Strattera, the new ADD medication for adults? I am not arguing that pills are a panacea, but rather that biology-along with sociology, environment, family structure, economic opportunity, physical or psychological trauma-are critical formative factors in the development of children and adults. In an interdisciplinary study of faith, one must ask just how many disciplines are necessary for a valid synthesis.<br />I was pleased to discover that Fowler published what is described as a revised edition of \\"Stages of Faith\\" under a different title in 1999. I will be curious to see where his thinking and research have taken him over two decades.revised edition of \\"Stages of Faith\\" under a different title in 1999.

The title is something of a misnomer. Some of Madden's subjects were never young Yankees. Reggie Jackson cut his teeth in Oakland, Lou Piniella caught fire in Kansas City, and Paul O'Neill even won a World Series ring in Cincinnati in 1990 before arriving at the East Coast. And even with the Yankee \\"lifers\\" interviewed for this work, many of the best remembered stories are about established ball players and their antics in their prime. Whitey, Mickey, Billy and Hank were hardly kids the night the Yanks trashed the Copa in 1957-in fact, it was Billy's 29th birthday that sparked the occasion. Yet this tale appears-more than once-among the multitude of memories along this nostalgic trail.<br />There are some interviews that actually do shed new light on Yankee history-or hagiography, if you will. Marius Russo's inclusion among Madden's subjects is fortuitous. One of the team's lesser known talents over the years, Russo, a left handed pitcher who joined the Yanks in 1938, was included in this work as one of the last living connections to the Iron Horse, Lou Gehrig. Russo sheds light on a remarkable Yankee pitching staff of 1939 remembered both for its depth and its sabermetrics. Seven starters finished the season with double figure wins: Ruffing [21-7], Hadley [12-6], Pearson [12-5], Gomez [12-8], Donald [13-3], Sundra [11-1], and Hildebrand [10-4]. Russo, added to the rotation late in the season [why?], went 8-3, including a 7-0 stretch in September. Russo would never win more than 14 games in any of his six Yankee seasons, but one of his most poignant memories involved fallout from the demise of Gehrig. When the Yankee team fell to fifth place in 1940, columnist Jimmy Powers of the New York Daily News reported that the entire team had been infected by Gehrig's \\"polio,\\" as his affliction was then diagnosed. The report shook baseball and resulted in a $1 million lawsuit against the writer.<br />Another lesser-known Yankee interviewee was the observant bench jockey and reserve catcher Charlie Silvera, whose entire nine years of backing up Berra, Houk, and Howard produced only 429 at bats. Silvera recalls an obscure but impressive Casey Stengel accomplishment: winning five successive World Series with a depleted roster. The Yankees, under the rules of the day, carried two or three prospects who never made the team but counted against the 25-man roster. Silvera's recollections also highlight one of the secrets of the Yankee dynasty: a network of astute West Coast scouts who steered reports of promising young prospects to the East Coast Yankee front office that took such reporting seriously. Silvera as much as anyone recounts the awe that most players since 1920 have felt about donning the Yankee pinstripes. Silvera and others-including many of the household names--are as proud of their being Yankees as their personal stats as Yankees. In a year where Silvera, for example, did not get his first at bat until June 17 [1949], he still won his first of five consecutive World Series rings.<br />As all of the interviewed players wore Yankee pinstripes, it is hard at times to separate the individuals from the history of the team itself. And one era that Madden treats with considerable detail is the post 1964 Yankee decline. Some of the best interviews come from Yankees who played or managed through that ten year era: Yogi, Ralph Houk, Mel Stottlemyre, Joe Pepitone, Bobby Richardson, Ron Blomberg, and Bobby Murcer. There are many theories of the fall of the Roman Empire, nearly as many as to the decline of the Yankees in those years. The author and the players named above are in fair agreement that poor front office management [trading Roger Maris to St. Louis, for example], the failure of certain Yankee veterans to obey \\"one of their own,\\" YogiBerra, as manager, the free agent draft, the decline of the farm teams, and parity. One other applicable statistic: I looked up the 1965 Yankee roster, and discovered exactly one African-American in the starting lineup, Elston Howard [whose widow Arlene is the only non-player interviewed for this work], and one black pitcher on the staff, Al Downing.<br />As an interviewer Bill Madden is more Eddie Lopat than Vic Raschi. The questions arrive to the plate with a gentle thud in the catcher's mitt or get obscured in the dust in front of home plate. Madden has no problem getting his subjects to cry, but he is averse to making them squirm. Thus the free pass to Whitey \\"Slick\\" Ford, whose nickname comes from the old expression \\"city-slicker.\\" Whitey's description of himself as a \\"professional drinker\\" in his playing days says nothing and says everything. It is no surprise he does not like to talk about Mickey and Billy, and Madden does not press.<br />But perhaps we should not be surprised that Madden is no Bob Woodward where investigative reporting is concerned. The author has covered the Yankees for a quarter century. I hardly think he would endanger the source of his bread and butter. It is in his vested interest in continue the legend, and he does this in a warm and congenial way. And we always have Jim Bouton for the hardball accounts.i Berra, as manager, the free agent draft, the decline of the farm teams, and parity.

Hirohito was no Hitler. They never met, and their styles and upbringing were diametrically opposite. Hitler used force of personality to perpetrate his genocide and destruction; Hirohito condoned his own genocide and war crimes from behind a sculpted mask of religion and myth. The eminently argued thesis of author Herbert Bix is that a weak, petty, and selfish man can be just as lethal as a megalomaniac at those perilous junctures in history.<br />Hirohito's grandfather was the great Meiji, whom readers may remember from high school days as the Japanese Emperor who warred with China and Russia at the turn of the twentieth century and upon whom Teddy Roosevelt kept a wary eye. Meiji did not always win his wars, but he was remarkably successful in creating a schizophrenic self-concept of his nation. On the one hand, Meiji maintained appearances of a modern, westernized world player with an emerging democratic government. At the same time, Meiji rejuvenated an ancient Japanese concept, \\"kokotai,\\" a term used frequently throughout the book. Kokotai embodied national, religious, and racial unity in the persona of the emperor. While kokotai was a remarkable unifier of the masses, if not the intellectuals, it also promoted tendencies toward xenophobia, racism, militarism, censorship and despotism, all of which would accelerate into the tragedies of the 1930's and beyond.<br />Meiji's son was a weak and distracted emperor, and thus the hopes of the nation fell upon the young regent, Hirohito. Certainly one of the more fascinating aspects of this work is the education of the young emperor-to-be. Democracies do not have this educational dilemma [though I had an uncle who would not vote for John Kennedy because the latter attended Harvard.] Bix's treatment of this preparatory stage is excellent for several reasons. In the first place, the reader gets a rather detailed description of the disciplines and philosophies  [and educational lacunae] that would shape Hirohito's thinking in his critical years in power. While much of the practical training resembles what I have read about West Point curriculum, philosophically one can rest assured that the concept of kokotai was woven through political, religious, and social formation.<br />But equally important is the issue of just who was chosen to teach the future emperor. Here we are introduced to another major force in the nebulous matrix of Japanese governance, the \\"imperial household.\\" I would prefer to define this institution with precision, but that is impossible. Over the course of the work the household includes, at various times, members of the royal family, career intimate advisors, favored politicians, and increasingly in later years members of the military's high command. During the emperor's regency period there were major disputes within the household about the direction of his training and development of his public persona. Later, upon the throne, Hirohito would himself choose his advisors, or at least it seemed so.<br />Assuming the throne in 1926 upon the death of his father Taisho, Hirohito cultivated a style of inscrutability and divine aloofness. He believed that the kokotai was defiled by any appearance of direct interference in political and military affairs, though he clearly had opinions and obliquely communicated them through intermediaries. Hirohito's aloofness had two major consequences: it weakened the Diet, which could have served as a moderating voice when internal and international tensions accelerated through the 1930's. And worse, it unleashed the adventuresome elements of the Japanese military, particularly Japan's considerable presence in China.<br />Japan's \\"New Deal\\" response to depression was the despoiling of China, a nation held by the Emperor and his subjects as racially inferior. In this respect Hirohito, like Hitler, used ultra-nationalism as a motivation for wartime sacrifices. And yet one gets the sense that the Emperor had lost control of his forces in China, hiding atrocities and taking credit for the army's maneuvers and conquests only after learning that they had happened. As more military influence permeated the imperial household, Hirohito gave a series of belated blessings to military expansion in Southeast Asia throughout the late 1930's and into the following decade. The attack on Pearl Harbor was the high water mark of Japan's military adventures. Oddly, Hirohito's own military fever heated up as his high command, thoroughly thrashed at Midway, began to think about extrication. Military defeat, which reveals the true depth of character in some men [Robert E. Lee comes to mind], succeeded in this case to only magnify the petty and self-centered nature of the Emperor, who actually risked a third nuclear strike on his own people in bartering for his own post war immunity.<br />Even so, Hirohito needed some post-war friends in high places. Whatever one thinks of Douglas MacArthur, he was a practical man who quickly grasped the usefulness of the kokotai for an occupation general. He saw no point in discrediting the Emperor if Hirohito's presence would soothe a broken nation and provide a benign rallying point. Moreover, the first chilly blasts of the cold war signaled the new alignment of nations. It was Russia [and later Mao's China], not Japan, that posed true threats to American security. Thus the last thing MacArthur needed was prosecution of Hirohito for war crimes, morally appropriate as that might be, nor propagation of the facts of the delayed surrender, which would have outraged the Japanese.  If by some historiographical miracle Bix's work had appeared in, say, 1947 instead of 2000, I believe it would have been embargoed in both Japan and the United States. But both nations preferred for their own reasons to perpetuate the kokotai deception till Hirohito's death in 1989, though by then Bix and other historians were well on their way to a more factual accounting of the Emperor's role in Japan's international crimes.ike Hitler, used ultra-nationalism as a motivation for wartime sacrifices.

It does seem that there are actually two books here: one, a medical analysis of the etiology of Bipolar Disorder,  particularly early onset in very young children; and another book guiding parents in recognizing the symptoms and navigating the  medical, insurance, and governmental mazes to obtain treatment for their children.  Be that as it may, the authors have written a very provocative treatment of Bipolar Disorder that brings into print what psychiatrists, mental health professionals, and many parents have been concerned about for some time.  For the past decade or so, there has been growing concern about the precision of children's diagnoses vis-&agrave;-vis Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  While many parents and school officials wonder if the ADHD diagnosis is rendered too often, there is another school of thought emerging that as many as a third of ADHD diagnoses are in reality cases of early onset Bipolar Disorder.<br />The authors are not alarmists; their stance, research, and professional networking is mainstream. But this work is alarming.  It argues from the testimony of hundreds of parents connected to the authors from around the country by the Internet, that their children were much more violently ill than DSM-IV criteria for ADHD would admit, and that traditional ADHD treatments were not working, in fact making the situations worse. Admitting that the ADHD/bipolar differential is tricky for the diagnostician, the authors have arrived at useful clinical clues.  For example, when a hyperactive child breaks something, more often than not he is angry with himself for his clumsiness. The bipolar child, on the other hand, often demonstrates an outward rage or anger with his destructive actions directed at family and peers. The Papoloses note also that bipolar children are more inclined to night terrors and violent imagination in story telling and art work.<br />The authors point out that pediatric pharmacology in the treatment of early-onset Bipolar Disorder is extremely critical and presents a wide array of problems.  As noted above, Bipolar Disorder can be mistaken for ADHD.  The standard medication for the latter has been stimulants, which unfortunately will severely aggravate the manic tendencies of the bipolar client.  Other clients may present as depressed, and even though the FDA has severely cautioned against the use of SSRI's with depressed children, it has not forbidden their use outright.  In children and adults, SSRI's have been found to trigger manic episodes where the depressed mood was a feature of misdiagnosed Bipolar Disorder.<br />Even when the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder is correctly made, the medication problems for children are significant.  Over the years the common practice has been the use of such mood stabilizers as Lithium and Depakote.  These medications have required regular blood work, which has made compliance an issue with children who naturally despise needles. More recently, anticonvulsant and atypical psychotic medications have proven useful in severe cases.  However, these medications involve significant side effects ranging from aggravated weight gain and acne to such extremes as facial distortions and the other trademark symptoms of psychotic medications. The Papoloses examine each medication, pro and con, to assist parents and practitioners in treating and educating their clients.<br />Parents are reminded that dating back to 1973 federal law has mandated the educational opportunities of children with mental disorders.  In a similar vein, children's rights to medical treatment, including institutionalization for weeks or months, are also reviewed under the provisions of Medicare and Medicaid, among other plans.  The authors are thorough in spelling out the rights and the best procedures to follow in dealing with the bureaucracies of government, schools, and insurancecompanies.  A number of useful organizations, with phone numbers and web sites, are provided.  However, in the two states whose budgets I  monitor, New York and Florida, Medicaid funding for children has been significantly reduced due to strapped state budgets. At this writing, California is considering wholesale reduction of service as well.  Consequently, even those parents who are faithful to the advice rendered by the Papoloses may have difficulty in accessing service. The authors' advice here, while correct may be a bit too rosy in the present health care environment. In addition, I attempted to use several of the web sites, and some of them have been disbanded.<br />But in the final analysis, this work fulfills what I think were the intentions of the authors.  First, it provides assurances to parents that the bizarre and deeply troubling behavior of their children may have organic causes for which they are not responsible.  Caregivers are reminded that they are not alone, that they have rights, and most importantly, that there are support groups and practitioners who are beginning to understand the scope of their problems.  Second, this work is successful in encouraging practitioners to think more expansively about the pervasiveness of early-onset Bipolar Disorder.  Until fairly recently popular wisdom had that Bipolar Disorder was \\"a grownup's disorder.\\"  Today any practitioner will tell you that in the absence of significant personal and family history, the establishment of a bipolar diagnosis is extremely difficult.  So much the more for children, particularly when we are not conditioned to routinely look for manic depressive features.<br />The Papoloses also discuss the troubling prospect that disorders of mood are gradually increasing in scope and intensity in America and appearing at earlier ages than ever before.  I do not expect that this contention will go unchallenged.  But if the authors are anywhere near correct in this contention, our research into the causes and treatment of many children's mental disorders, which now appear inherited and to emanate from the frontal regions of the brain, must accelerate not only for the safety of our children and families, but as a humane gesture to their suffering.ies.

US	52709329	R3J5ESE8FDK5HM	048641762X	417239079	Erasmus and the Age of Reformation	Books	5	52	55	N	Y	Man in the Middle	Of particular value to the reader is the preface of this work, penned in 1952 by the then Provost of Oriel College, Oxford, G.N. Clark. The brief preface introduces not only the work but the author, Johan Huizinga, perhaps as a halting effort at rehabilitation. Clark reminds the readers that Huizinga had suffered through two world wars and was imprisoned by the Nazis, and died in February, 1945, literally days before his beloved Holland was liberated: an apologia of sorts for a most controversial scholar.<br />Huizinga had shaken the European and American historical and religious establishments with the publication of his most famous work, \\"The Waning of the Middle Ages,\\" in 1919. In that work Huizinga introduced a novel gestalt for interpreting the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, upsetting historians of his day who still clung to the traditional strictures of epochs, and Churchmen, notably Catholic, for his candor in debunking ecclesiastical mythology of that era. [\\"The Waning\\" was actually placed on the Index of Forbidden Books for a time.] Clark argues that the Erasmus text is a companion piece to \\"The Waning,\\" a useful point to remember in assessing this biography.<br />For all the energy generated by their respective forces, neither the Renaissance nor the Reformation was particularly rich in seminal philosophical inquiry. In fact, the sixteenth century was in many respects quite conservative, with its veneration of Classical thought, Aristotelian scientific method, and religious interest in primary sources. Erasmus's lifespan, 1466-1536, was an age of application, where orthopraxis was making a run at orthodoxy. Erasmus has always enjoyed reputation as the consummate \\"Renaissance Man,\\" literary giant, man of letters, humane reformer, diplomat. In this work he is still the preeminent Renaissance man, but in the Renaissance of Huizinga's making, when being a \\"Renaissance Man\\" was a dicier proposition than popularly held. He was after all, a friend of both Thomas More and Henry VIII. Huizinga's Erasmus is brilliant, though not particularly original, and he was often broke, sick, insecure, unemployed, displaced-at the height of his reputation, no less.<br />The original literary works of Erasmus demonstrate scholarship, mastery of the pen, satire, wit, and synthesis. As Huizinga observed, Erasmus wrote less from piety than from humanistic reasoning. Despite the fact that his \\"Praise of Folly\\" is his best remembered original work, Erasmus had little patience for folly, which he would have defined in real life as extremism, violence, or pretension. His satire could be pointed, but he was never mad at the world per se, only those who would deface it needlessly. Theologically, he espoused \\"low church Catholicism\\" stripped of both spiritual and practical indulgences. His satire poked fun at Church excess, but this was hardly earthshaking at a time when many intellectuals laughed down their sleeves at ecclesiastical pomp.<br />His major gift to the Renaissance and subsequent ages, in my view, is his application of philology to the Sacred Scriptures, an effort that would also cause his greatest friction with Catholicism. With the reverence of antiquity so common to his age, Erasmus mastered Latin and Greek to the point where he was able to discover major linguistic flaws in the official Catholic translation of Scripture, St. Jerome's Latin Vulgate edition. Erasmus, an eminently reasonable man, assumed that his Church would tolerate-in fact, welcome-a cleaner, more accurate rendering of the Bible, and he proceeded to edit the Vulgate with available Greek manuscripts. Pascal was yet to be born, so perhaps Erasmus can be excused his shock that the loyal faithful remained devoted to the Vulgate \\"for reasons of the heart.\\" The Vulgate translation in 1500 enjoyed an almost sacramental reverence; it was the official text for the sacraments and, in fact, for all of the great body of scholastic medieval theology that synthesized orthodox Catholicism and the cosmos.<br />As every contemporary Scripture scholar is painfully aware, every translation is in fact an interpretation, a point not lost upon the Roman Curia. Given his known temperament, one would have to concede that Erasmus, who routinely fled from confrontation, was rather innocent of the charge that he was undermining things sacred. But worse, Erasmus had opened the door to doubts regarding the credibility of a sacred work which was in its own right a part of antiquity, having been composed around 400 A.D.

Given his known temperament, one would have to concede that Erasmus, who routinely fled from confrontation, was rather innocent of the charge that he was undermining things sacred. But worse, Erasmus had opened the door to doubts regarding the credibility of a sacred work which was in its own right a part of antiquity, having been composed around 400 A.D.

I had a desire to go back and reread this work on the tenth anniversary of its publication. I was curious to see how Dr. Peter Kramer's magnificent essay of the mysteries of mood and matter had stood the test of time. I was also interested to see how far the psychiatric-pharmaceutical complex had come in the past decade in dealing with the scourge of depression and other mental disorders.<br />But before I get too far ahead of myself, exactly what was it about this book that made it such a provocative success in 1993? Two factors come to mind almost immediately. The first is the remarkable story-telling and philosophical style of the author. Yes, the crux of this work was the ethical dilemma of physicians who for the first time possessed the legal and medicinal power to alter personality cosmetically. But we forget over the years that this book was much more than a pharmaceutical morality play. It was a fascinating look at the pioneers of the biotechnology era, a glimpse into the hit and miss processes whereby paradigms and hypotheses were transformed into molecular formulas. The author made lucid for the general public just how mysterious  the matrix between the material and the metaphysical truly is. That the new psychotropic drugs could morph a wallflower into a grand dame was becoming evident, so to speak, but the reasons for the change remained well educated guesses, and nothing more, in 1993. Such a tale was both tantalizing and troubling, and no one before Kramer had quite animated psychiatry while circumscribing it in such an elegant way.<br />The second attraction of this book was the drug itself, Fluoxetine, marketed under the brand name Prozac. Prozac was not the only member of new wave antidepressants, the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRI's, available in 1993. [Zoloft was on the market by then.] But Prozac intrigued the public for different reasons than it enthralled Dr. Kramer. Prozac had a public relations problem: allegedly it promoted suicide and other evils, charges easily discredited with time but not until the medication had run the Larry King/60 Minute gamut of journalistic fury. Kramer did for Prozac what the Crocodile Hunter would later do for venomous reptiles, remind us that though potent the SSRI's can be handled safely by trained professionals.<br />It has been ten years since this work was published, and seventeen years since the appearance of Prozac. Have we grown in wisdom regarding the relation of mood and chemicals in the human nervous system, and have we seen a stampede of new clients looking for psychological facelifts from new generation psychotropics? To respond to the first question, pharmaceutical inquiry over the past decade has continued to focus upon the neurotransmitter model of cellular communication in the brain--the cute Zoloft TV cartoon of little bullets or messengers passing back and forth between mother ships. There is now question as to whether Serotonin is the only bullet in the holster, with researchers looking at the roles of dopamine and norepinephrine in the alteration of mood. Moreover, the SSRI's have proven effective over time with more disorders besides depression--everything from obsessions to pain management. But no new major theory of mood disorder has displaced those discussed by Kramer. The kindling theory of illness described by Kramer [110ff.] and the genetic disposition toward illness in successive generations of families seem to have created more interest in pediatric psychiatry and the importance of early intervention. What has certainly changed in a decade is Prozac's reputation; it is now the safe old plow horse of the stable, the only SSRI considered truly tolerable for minors.<br />As to the second issue, personality enhancement, Kramer's worries may have been misplaced. Kramer was low keyed in his discussion of side effects, but the SSRI's have been bedeviled by them to the present day. Most notably the sexual side effects have put a damper upon elective use of the medication. Sexual impairment is a high price to pay for enhanced self confidence, though new formulations and time release capsules have ameliorated the side effects some. [The real stampede, ironically, has been toward Viagra.] But when push comes to shove, the past decade indicates that, bottom line, Americans continue to entertain a pharmaceutical Calvinism, a suspicion of medicine, and more recently, of the companies that make them. When I undertake a mental health assessment, the first question I get is inevitably: \\"You're not going to recommend drugs, are you?\\" One common example: parents resist stimulants for their ADHD children like the plague. Contrary to popular belief, America is not a country of eager pill poppers, and this has been true even before the recent surge in medicine costs. Pills are for \\"when you're sick.\\"<br />If anything, there is a thinly veiled contempt for medical interventions that enhance the human experience beyond convention. Evidently there is a national consensus that every man deserves a good erection. But buried deep in the national subconscious is the spirit of the Hippocratic Oath. Or, conceivably, we have taught people to \\"just say no\\" a little too indiscriminately where medication is concerned. But by and large cosmetic physical interventions still carry a certain stigma. There is a slight revulsion to the idea that Barry Bonds' 73 home runs were steroid enhanced, or that Pamela Anderson's prime assets are [or were] primarily silicone. There have been pharmaceutical betrayals, too, in the last ten years, notably Redux and Fen Fen. In retrospect Kramer's fears about the ethics of altering personality have been trumped by the inbred suspicion of the \\"quick fix.\\" Who among us does not hold an innate suspicion of ads for \\"miracle weight loss?\\" A nation reluctant to eat a steady diet of meat to lose weight is probably not ready for instant personality remakes.er upon elective use of the medication.

US	52709329	R3IAJNP31U7UVI	0700603204	516582786	The Presidency of Benjamin Harrison (American Presidency Series)	Books	4	14	16	N	Y	With No Favors From Blaine	Not only is he one of America's lesser known presidents, Benjamin Harrison is not even the better known of presidents named Harrison. His grandfather, William Henry Harrison, bears the name most Americans remember if they recognize the Harrison name at all. Old Harrison made his name as a dashing military hero; his grandson decades later would fight well under Sherman and attained the rank of brevet brigadier general, but as events would unfold, the country was awash in brevet generals in 1888.<br />The University Press of Kansas began its presidency series with a treatment of George Washington's tenure in 1974, and as of this writing has brought the series as far along as the presidency of George Bush, Senior. A survey of the series indicates that coincidentally or not, all the volumes to date are remarkably similar in length, just under three hundred pages in most cases. Critics may argue that presidencies such as Lincoln's or FDR's might merit more ink than, say, Franklin Pierce or our subject at hand, Benjamin Harrison. Having read several volumes, I would say that the success of the series to date has been bringing the achievements of the lesser known presidents to more public prominence. Presidents such as Hayes and the second Harrison have done better by this series than have Nixon or Kennedy, whose volumes naturally have had to compete with the products of the likes of  Sorensen, Manchester, Caro, Dallek, etc.<br />The University Press has attempted to stay focused upon the presidencies themselves, which has had the effect of dulling some of our more charismatic leaders and their colorful pasts. [One wonders how the editors will come to grips with Monica Lewinski, when that day inevitably arrives.]  Diminishment of charisma is not a problem when treating of Harrison. He was Robert Taft before there was Robert Taft, a tweedy Midwest lawyer who successfully put the excitement of war behind him and nurtured a competent, unflappable, and predictable personality. He won and lost a senate seat prior to the Republican convention of 1888, and became an eighth ballot nominee when it became clear that his party's reigning Hamlet, James G. Blaine, would not run, apparently for reasons of health.<br />Harrison's pragmatism led him to undertake the formation of his cabinet as an exercise in party unity. One can probably argue that Harrison's presidency never really survived the selection process, for Harrison, in a gesture of perhaps insecurity and stubbornness, refused to allow state party bosses their traditional say in cabinet appointments. Harrison chose a cabinet of men like himself: Midwesterners, brevet generals, Presbyterians. And, until the very last moment, no Blaine. Maine's favorite son assumed himself a shoo-in as Secretary of State. Blaine, a master of denial whose illnesses compromised his effectiveness in Harrison's cabinet, and Mrs. Blaine, put out by her perception of Harrison's lack of reverence for her husband, were simply two of many disgruntled forces in the Republican Party. That the Democrats would storm back in the 1890 congressional elections--aided by a distinct lack of Republican enthusiasm--was predictable early in the Harrison presidency.<br />Harrison's domestic policy prior to 1890 focused upon issues which, to one degree or another, had been problematic since the Civil War. Tariff restraints, currency debates, civil service reform, civil rights, management of western territories, Indian affairs [including the battle at Wounded Knee], immigration, labor issues and safety were regular staples of government debate. With the House and Senate nearly evenly matched till the 1890 elections, there were no spectacular federal breakthroughs for which Harrison could claim victory. The authors do note that the president deserves more credit for his efforts to establish federal land reserves in the teeth of opposition from the lumber industry. It is also worth noting that more states were formed under Harrison'sadministration than under any other president; the northwestern alignment of states, as we know them today, took shape with apparently minimal controversy.<br />Harrison's alienation from party leaders, an unremarkable first two years, his administrative inexperience, and a rather cold demeanor did not augur well for a long tenure in the White House. The disastrous [for Republicans] returns of 1890 assured that Harrison in all likelihood would not lead the ticket in 1892. [His wife's illness and death in that year would make such considerations irrelevant when the time came at any rate.]<br /> Harrison turned his attention to foreign affairs in the last half of his presidency. By 1890 it was beginning to dawn upon politicians of both parties that affairs in Central and South America were taking on an added importance in this country's commerce and defense. For most of the century America's chief concern had been the designs of foreign powers from across the sea. Now the necessity of an ocean-to-ocean canal involved this country more deeply into the relations of South American countries themselves. Harrison was not the first, and certainly not the last, president to assert American hegemony on the South American continent, and his warlike gestures toward Chile were of a cloth with McKinley and certainly Roosevelt, who admired Harrison's belligerence. Harrison also saw the importance of American military and fueling bases in the Pacific in the face of growing German interest in the region. It is not clear that Harrison fully appreciated the unfolding of the new international military order in the way that an Alfred Thayer Mahan or Theodore Roosevelt would, but he can be commended for fidelity to a policy that made the American position in South America and the Pacific much more tenable. And, it should be noted, Harrison conducted his foreign policy without the help of Blaine, who was too ill to assist and too proud to step aside.<br />Harrison was re-nominated by the anti-Blaine forces of his own party but without wholesale Republican support.

US	52709329	R2W2ACSAI2KX1J	0395720419	438957874	While the Music Lasts: My Life in Politics	Books	3	12	16	N	N	It May Be Music, But It's A Sad Tune	Do not be misled by the title or the cover of this work. While there are moments of hilarity in this book, there is a tragic quality to the life of William Bulger that extends even beyond the publishing of this book in 1996. The author made news within the past year when he was dismissed from the presidency of the University of Massachusetts, a personal disgrace with roots in both Massachusetts politics and the author's intractability.<br />William Bulger was a career Massachusetts politician, making his first run for the Massachusetts house of representatives in 1960. Eventually he would serve seventeen years as president of the Massachusetts Senate, no mean feat in that state's Byzantine political culture, until he assumed the reins of the University of Massachusetts at about the time of the publishing of this book. He was a product of the self-contained community of South Boston, a neighborhood of modest incomes, generally good folks, and thoroughly marinated in the Irish sauce of religion, politics, and penny ante corruption. At an early age Bulger discovered the circus element of politics and what passed for dirty tricks in the 1940's. He tells genuinely  funny stories of political mishaps he witnessed as a child. The best, in my view, is the tale of the perennially soused postman who is scared sober by a horse in a third story apartment--the animal having been abandoned there by a political candidate with a cash flow problem.<br />Bulger does not dramatize his Herculean efforts to get himself, penniless,  into Boston College High School, and subsequently through BC's law school, with an army tenure in between. It is somewhat more difficult to assess his description of his older brother, Jim. Bulger describes him as bright, somewhat oppositional, and unstructured. Juvenile delinquency eventually would progress into armed robbery. Bulger suggests that police brutality and bad companions contributed to his downfall, which eventually led him to Alcatraz. Bulger denies knowledge of his brother's subsequent activities, though the FBI would press the author years later. In 2003 the Republican Governor, Mitch Romney, removed the author from his university position on the grounds of his suspected association with his brother and hindering criminal investigation.<br />Marrying the woman in 1960 who would bear his nine children, Bulger entered state politics as a traditional Massachusetts progressive of the 1960's: he believed in government's role to improve the hundreds of neighborhood communities like his own. One of his particular interests was stricter interventions for abused or neglected children. State representatives like Bulger knew their constituencies intimately and their offices were as much social service centers to assist in employment and local quality of life. Bulger was a horse trader, to be sure, but he viewed the process as a necessary evil. It was never a matter of the thrill of the hunt, as it was for Lyndon Johnson, for example. Bulger was living proof of Tip O'Neill's dictum that all  politics are ultimately local.<br />The great wound of Bulger's political and personal life was his limited understanding of the American revolution of the 1960's, specifically the Civil Rights movement. For the old school politician Bulger, his responsibility lie with South Boston. The plight of neighboring Roxbury was, in his mind, the responsibility of citizens and politicians in that community. The idea that federal law and the judiciary would override local political structures, and worse, that such interference would be undertaken arrogantly and in the guise of social engineering appalled Bulger, who maintains to this day that the excesses of the judiciary destroyed his beloved South Boston.<br />The villains of this work are Judge W. Arthur Garrity and, to a lesser extent, The Boston Globe. Garrity's name may ring a bell with older readers, particularly if paired with that of Louise Day Hicks, a Bulger compatriot, in thecontext of school busing. At the time of the Boston busing crisis, 1974, the national news coverage depicted  neighborhoods like South Boston  as bastions of Jim Crow separatism. As a lawyer and resident of South Boston, Bulger was deeply troubled by what he first perceived as judicial social engineering; later, he became more incensed by the intimidating tactics of riot police in the streets of his own neighborhood.  Looking back thirty years, Garrity's judicial excesses are troubling, and the acquiescence of the Globe most disappointing.<br />Having said that, it must also be admitted that Bulger's limited comprehension of civil rights and social policy  probably contributed to the problem. He admits that the schools in Roxbury were a nightmare, but he adopts the attitude that Athens has nothing to say to Jerusalem. This is the price of parochialism, the inability to see that racism, as a national problem, could not be addressed piecemeal like filling potholes after a bad winter. As a politician, he did not see this freight train approaching, a reality that, I suspect, fuels his bitterness of those bad days.<br />That Bulger survived the 1970's and would rise to become his state's kingmaker for many years is a tribute to the author's doggedness; had Bulger resigned during the heyday of Gerrity's excesses, no one would have second-guessed him. But he remained, continuing such traditions as his annual St. Patrick's Day breakfast, a must for every politician on the make, even the Kennedys. He was not exactly loved by his peers, but seems to have been respected. His consistency as much as anything kept Massachusetts government functioning as efficiently as it did. He was as ethical as his circumstances permitted, and despised political arrangements that did not pass the smell test. It is sad to note that a career like Bulger's ended under the shadows that it did.context of school busing.

Here we have a magnificent companion piece to the Martin Gilbert biography of about a decade ago. Roy Jenkins brings to this work not only his own considerable skills as a historian, but the unique insights of a long time member of the House of Commons, Home Secretary, and Chancellor of the Exchequer, to cite a portion of his impressive personal resume. Jenkins has the added advantage of having entered British politics in 1948, at a time when Churchill himself was still a considerable presence.<br />Although the emphasis in this work rests upon Churchill's remarkable political odyssey, the reader gradually comes to the realization that he or she has absorbed a considerable amount of the Churchill persona. Jenkins achieves this with numerous sidebars about such diverse topics as Churchill's preference for Mediterranean vacations because the variations of sunlight affected his painting, or his tortured relationship with his son, Randolph. Jenkins acknowledges that Churchill was an epicure and prodigious drinker but hesitates to brand his consumption as problematic.<br />Churchill's true vice was neither brandy nor cigars, but hubris, mercifully tempered by an innate sense of decency, history, and loyalty to the kingdom in the best sense of the term. He truly believed in the inevitability of his destiny as his country's leader, a trait that made popular elections more precarious for him than need be. That he was self-centered cannot be denied, and Jenkins does not pretend that it was otherwise. After one thousand pages it is hard to say who, if anyone, enjoyed what one might call a friendship of equals with Churchill, who either dominated a dinner table or [rarely] said nothing. And yet, by the same token, Churchill was not a mean-spirited man, either, and it is hard to recall from this work incidents of particular cruelty or longstanding hatreds. He seemed to accept as the nature of things his own superiority to other men in government. The only Prime Minister who had the true measure of Churchill was Asquith, who exercised considerable patience with Churchill during the latter's controversial management of naval strategy during World War I.<br />Jenkins brings home the reality of Churchill's suffering. Churchill's voracious need to lead, and the nervousness that his undisguised animal energy engendered in the councils of British government, kept him on the outside when critical decisions were made at places like Versailles and Munich. That moodiness and depression would afflict this man should come as no surprise. Churchill, a prodigious author and historian of no mean talent in his own right, did enjoy the talent of \\"seeing twenty moves ahead.\\" His penetrating insight and unflagging confidence in his own judgment made exclusion all the more excruciating. But again, to his credit, Churchill hated the exlusion and scorned other judgments without the pathological anger that made future collaboration impossible. This is critical to English survival, when Churchill's rescusitation after Munich brought him into the enclave of many in British government who thought him dangerous and reckless, if not insufferably arrogant.<br />Jenkins states that Churchill was a faithful husband, though that compliment must be narrowly interpreted to mean that his subject was monogamous. Clementine Churchill bore his children, campaigned for him with perhaps more enthusiasm than her husband with his sense of entitlement, and exercised some influence upon his thinking. But like everyone else in Churchill's life, she had to resign herself to his preoccupation with affairs of state and impulsive and autocratic decision making. Early on, it would seem, she must have sensed that while her husband loved her, his ego and sense of divine right would never let him need her or depend upon her. Jenkins notes without comment Mrs. Churchill's frequent andlengthy vacations without her husband.<br />Having portrayed his subject thusly, Jenkins' description of Churchill's retirement from public life is intriguing and semi-tragic. Once again summoned for national leadership in 1951 in advanced age, Churchill found himself surrounded by \\"pharaohs who remembered not Joseph.\\" His efforts to reenact World War II summitry, to bring Russia and the United States together for the purpose of nuclear disarmament, was seen universally as part anachronism, part utopianism, and part that cursed self aggrandisement. His physical, vocal, and mental capacities slipping, Churchill appeared more and more like a desperate old man hanging on frantically in what he certainly knew was his last hurrah. Here Jenkins captures the national ambivalence toward Churchill, his country's greatest leader-gratitude for past courageous leadership, muffled relief to see him go.<br />I cannot quite find the proper adjective to describe the writer's syle. Although this work is a serious history, it has a coziness to it fostered by the author's inclusion of humorous sidebars, historical curiosities [for example, a footnote on page 427 makes note of Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt missing each other during the former's visit to New York in 1929], the author's own personal knowledge of his subject and his government, and his allusions to contemporary British government policy and personalities, such as Margaret Thatcher and John Major.

US	52709329	R1I2JDCKSHQW6J	081320951X	522510284	The Refashioning of Catholicism, 1450-1700: A Reassessment of the Counter Reformation	Books	5	62	63	N	Y	More Life Than Previously Believed	This is an interesting introduction to an era that traditionally bears the name \\"Counter Reformation.\\" Bireley, a Jesuit Professor of History at Loyola University of Chicago, argues persuasively in his opening remarks that the term \\"Counter Reformation\\" has outlived its usefulness in the study of Catholic history. In fact, he observes, nearly all of what we would call today post-Tridentine reform not only has roots in the fifteenth century but in many cases was in full bloom and inspired the council to do what it did. Trent, in his view of things, was the institutional crest of a wave that had been building for a century. Moreover, Bireley's global view-geographic, political, scientific, theological-invites the reader to view the Church against the backdrop of forces it could not control and critique the many accommodations made by the Church to the world of the seventeenth century.<br />Why 1450? One reason was geographic exploration. The exploits of DeGama and Columbus reflected a growing sense of the cosmos, later amplified by Galileo and others; a new economic world order, so to speak; and the increasing sense of nationalism and centralization of governments, later abetted by formalized \\"confessions\\" of religious doctrine and worship after Luther. Another reason for this new delineation of Catholic epochs was the Renaissance and the humanistic philosophy it nurtured, which the author maintains had significant impact upon many major Catholic leaders of the time, including Ignatius Loyola and Francis de Sales. At the other end of the chronological spectrum, Bireley designates 1700 as a marker because of the impact of Cartesian rationalism upon official Catholic thought in the bigger context of the Enlightenment itself.<br />Without ignoring the contemporary problems of the \\"Catholic confession\\"-papal excesses, poor training of priests, etc.-Bireley is remarkably upbeat about the condition of the Catholic Church at the time of the Reformation and the Council of Trent in the sense that the need for reform was widely recognized and in many places being addressed already. Popular piety throughout Europe was strong in pockets, and the printing press, so often termed a tool of Protestant reformers, was cranking out thousands of copies of \\"The Imitation of Christ.\\" The author notes that in the late fifteenth century the existing religious orders, or at least many of them, were distinguishing themselves by excellent preaching, pastoral practice, and adaptation.<br />After 1500, however, the combined challenges of Protestant confessions, humanist demands of higher education, and missionary work, not to mention ecclesiastical reform itself, led to a veritable explosion of new religious orders. Not surprisingly, the Jesuit phenomenon is extensively chronicled. But to his credit, Bireley gives significant attention to Francis de Sales and the Salesian efforts to address the spiritual needs of the new humanized Catholic. Joined with the efforts of the new Capuchins, Ursulines, Oratorians, Hospitalers, Theatines, Oratorians, Visitandines, Piarists, Barnabites, Sulpicians, and the Christian Brothers, to cite several, these movements addressed the above cited needs in ways that have sculpted the Catholic experience to the present day.<br />It is probably obvious that none of the above named orders is, strictly speaking, contemplative. Bireley contends that the paradigmatic shift in Catholic thinking in this era was toward the world, not away from it. Educators, confessors, and spiritual directors and writers consciously or subconsciously picked up the gauntlet set down by Machiavelli, whose thesis broadly read argues that the marketplace is the arena of practicality, not faith. It is no accident that the curriculum of Catholic schools at every level broadened to include the best of classical thought, that Aquinas and the idea of synthesis came back into style, and the Jesuits added drama and the fine arts to their standard cursus studiorum.Theologically speaking, it was an age of \\"doing.\\" Loyola himself did not impose choir upon his men to free them for mission. The case study or manualist method of moral theology was born.<br />Certainly no collective group was doing more than the missionaries. The work of the Church in the new worlds is complex and not without controversy on many levels. Bireley is somewhat limited by this complexity in his attempt to give an overview of the missionary situation, but in general no one can deny that it was not large scale and heroic. The argument is often made that Catholic missionary efforts were part of a larger colonization effort. Bireley implies in his overview that this accusation is probably more appropriate to those missionaries whose monarchs exercised state control of the Church in their kingdoms, such as Spain and Portugal. By contrast, missionaries working more directly with the papacy and the newly formed Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, such as the Jesuits in the East, worked with remarkably less baggage, the Malabar Rites Controversy notwithstanding.<br />Although only two hundred pages, this is a thought provoking work that on the whole depicts a Roman Catholicism of considerably more vigor and spirituality than is generally attributed to the Reformation era. Certainly the author's thoughts on the importance of the new religious orders, humanism, and ecclesiastical globalization call for further reading and reflection. Curiously, this work, published by The Catholic University of America, was printed in China. One way or another, Francis Xavier was going to get there.

US	52709329	R1OQGQZEYBGZR5	0809129906	617263908	Francis de Sales, Jane de Chantal: Letters of Spiritual Direction (Classics of Western Spirituality (Paperback)) (English and French Edition)	Books	4	52	54	N	N	Mellow Advice in a Cantankerous Age	It is probably worth recapping the history of this remarkable series of spiritual writings provided by Paulist Press. In the late 1970s Paulist set out to provide a limited number of volumes of great western spiritual thinkers and authors. The original goal, as I recall, was to produce approximately eighty volumes for subscription or individual purchase, spread out over a period of about twenty years. Apparently the success of the series has prompted Paulist to continue the series indefinitely, and at last count the series is now at over one hundred volumes as it approaches the end of its third decade. It is worth noting that over the past thirty years the Paulists have stretched the term \\"Western\\" to encompass about two thirds of the globe, but no one is the poorer for that.<br />The volume at hand was published in 1988 and follows the established outline of all the works to date, an introduction to the author[s] followed by the texts themselves. This volume includes an unremarkable preface by Henri Nouwen. It appears that in this particular work at least some of the letters are making their first appearance in English, although in other volumes [Augustine, Francis of Assisi, etc.] it would seem that the effort has been to bring forth either more contemporary or more readable translations of works already in English translation.<br />The introduction of ninety pages outlines in broad strokes the lives of both Francis de Sales and Jane de Chantal, as well as the general outline of Salesian spirituality. When compared to Franciscan or Jesuit spirituality, the Salesian ideal of a holy life may seem almost pedestrian, certainly not revolutionary. The emphases are fidelity to prayer, purity of intention, holiness within the marketplace, an assumption of a loving God and the attendant joy appropriate to that fact. The commentators are careful to give Jane her due, noting that she was not simply Francis de Sales's first disciple but a co-creator of the Salesian heritage.<br />There are 170 pages of letters of spiritual direction from both Francis and Jane. Francis's style reflects a French chivalry that might raise eyebrows today, given that he seemed to devote his considerable spiritual attention to women. Jane reflects a more practical style, given her role as foundress of the Visitandine Order of women, an unusual community for its time, which recruited more mature women with storied pasts and played down austerity for devotion, moderation, and charity. Jane is not the poet that Francis is, but as a widow with four grown children, her understanding of life is perhaps a touch more realistic. Jane's letters include some with a very practical bent: the management of miscreant novices, advice to her children about marriage, concerns about attached endowments, etc.<br />The commentators are wise to sketch the landscape of European Catholic life prior to the presentation of the letters themselves. The Salesian movement developed at the height of the counter-Reformation.  The somewhat mellow style of Salesian/Visitandine spirituality and expression must be seen against the early seventeenth century rough and tumble ecclesiastical landscape, a time of bitter wrangling with matters of reform, sacramental discipline, free will and predestination. Roman Catholicism, less than a century removed from Luther, was quite skittish about novelty. It is worth remembering that at the time these letters were composed the scientist Galileo was coming under the scrutiny of Robert Bellarmine and the Inquisition. Neither Francis nor Jane appears to have raised the ire of the Inquisition, but the commentators hint that only Francis's open communication with Bellarmine allowed the somewhat unconventual Visitandines to survive.<br />One of the strengths of the Paulist Press series is its diversity. Not everyone will find this volume of letters an immediate source of stimulation or inspiration, nor is either writer particularly gifted in the art of spiritualmetaphor.  In terms of the entire series, this volume is definitely among the more sedate, though hardly without merit and useful for those of us who need to be called back to the basics. In fairness, it would probably serve the reader to examine three or four different volumes [eg. Julian of Norwich, Robert Bellarmine, Nil Sorsky, etc.] to form a judgment on the entire series.itual metaphor.

Having read the book, I now realize the work is misnamed. It is a historical essay, not a chronicle. It is not a treatment of the Roman Catholic Church, but rather of the emergence of the centralized governing style of the western or Roman Catholic system. And, though good folks may argue this point, it is more of a critique or commentary than objective overview.<br />Anone who has followed Kung's brilliant academic career, involvement in Vatican II, controversial writings, struggles with the Vatican, and persecution by the Catholic Right probably has a fair sense of the author's outlook upon the present magisterial papacy. I have read that in his day Kung was a formidable tennis player. Certainly he has been the John McEnroe of the Vatican II generation of theological greats. His emphases upon church structure, reform, and ecumenism have been delivered over the years with the subtlety of a steam piston engine; even his habit of referring to popes by their last names [\\"the Montini pope\\"] carries a grating edge, and no one can deny that the Vatican has returned the favor.<br />But surprisingly, as the Swiss Lion enters the sunset years of his life, the beliefs are still there but the mood is different, certainly in this work. What should we call it-sadness? Nowhere is this better exemplified than in his 2002 epilogue to the original work, added at the height of the priest pedophelia controversy. The piece adds nothing insightful to the general work or to the controversy at hand and in fact makes some arguments that stretch credulity to the breaking point. It is part \\"I told you so\\" and part \\"Is this what we have to show for forty years of reform?\\"<br />If anything, the epilogue explains the book: the author's central thesis being that a powerful papacy and genuine reform are antithetical. As a history text this work highlights what the author sees as major exertions of centralized power and their generally doleful outcomes, or on the other hand, notable papal omissions [pre-Luther inactivity regarding church reform, Pius XII and the Jews, etc.] He argues-as have many others-that there is little or no justification for the shape of the present papacy and curia based upon biblical or postapostolic writings or practice. I do not see that this work will move many readers from either strong papalist camps [if they read this work at all] or add much to the weaponry of those who share a concern that monarchical popes such as John Paul II create organizational and spiritual paralysis at the grassroots level.<br />It has been my experience that reformers are not always competent sociologists, and in reacting to this  work the thoughtful reader may legitimately ask from time to time what form of church organization and governance would best serve the faithful. Kung is not clear on this point, and in his preoccupation with the Curia he does tend to overlook the historical sins of religious orders and dioceses, or tends to see them as organic outcroppings of papal excesses. In its own way this work is excessively clerical, overlooking one of the very elementary principles of Vatican II, the baptismal power and responsibility of the laity. In the United States, for example, where the focus of lay theological interest seems to be the availability of convenient parking for Mass, it would seem rather heavy handed to place all ownership of spiritual mediocrity upon popes and bishops. Perhaps the general indifference of laity after forty years brings a sadness to the Swiss Lion that he cannot yet put to paper in old age.uthor's central thesis being that a powerful papacy and genuine reform are antithetical.

US	52709329	R6ACDUZ7IL7P6	0719057434	608203406	Heresy in the Later Middle Ages : The Relation of Heterodoxy to Dissent C.1250-C.1450	Books	5	17	17	N	N	The Years Have Been Kind	I first came across this work in 1972 while researching the apocalyptic vision of the Spiritual Franciscans. Now, thirty some years later, I have had the leisure to digest this magnificent and epic historical analysis of late medieval heresy, which has stood the test of time as a detailed and thoughtful unfolding of dissent against orthodox Catholic thought and practice. Leff takes the reader from the divisions within the Franciscan Order through the various spiritualist movements and on to the eras of Wycliffe and Hus. This work stops at the gates of Luther's revolt, but to his credit Leff restrains himself from the temptation to depict the Reformation as an inevitable organic outcropping of two centuries of Church dissent. His heresies are related, but only to a point. Wycliffe is not Hus, Peter Olivi is not Waldo, the Beguins are not Taborites. <br />It would appear that the unifying factor in the author's mind is the use and misuse of the vow and/or practice of poverty.  Prior to the arrival of Francis and Dominic to the ecclesiastical scene, heresy, while not exactly a private matter, was usually debated and condemned away from the glare of public scrutiny. Certainly one of the more notorious controversies of the early Middle Ages, Berengarius of Tours' treatises on the Eucharist, was contested rather exclusively at the university and episcopal levels. In the demographics of the day, who among the countless Catholic peasants truly grasped the subtleties of a suspect Berengarius, or a mainstream Peter Lombard, for that matter? <br />The appearance of the mendicant orders, with emphasis upon consecrated poverty, introduced what in the language of late twentieth century social sciences would be termed \\"measurable outcomes.\\" It was hard, and still is, to measure a man's conscience or his innermost beliefs. Poverty, with its attendant hardship of life and absence of worldly goods, allowed the medieval world-bishop and peasant alike-to assess the holiness and commitment of a professed believer. It did not take a university professor to discern a disparity between the power, arrogance, and material wealth of many church leaders, and the life of deprivation practiced by certain of the mendicant monks and their followers. <br />Leff begins his work with a study of Franciscan Peter John Olivi, an extremist on the primacy of poverty, to be sure, but not to the degree of his contemporary and future followers. Olivi's sin, it seems, was his implication that poverty and ecclesiastical legitimacy were connected, so that the authority of a corrupt [worldly] pope could be superceded. Moreover, Olivi connected the preeminence of poverty and the ideals of Francis of Assisi with the apocalypticism of Joachim of Flora, adding a certain content of excitement and inevitability to a reform of institutional Catholicism along the lines of material divestiture.<br />To varying degrees, the devotion to poverty and the inevitable reforms it bred are intertwined with the multifarious heretical movements that would dot the ecclesiastical landscape till the sixteenth century. Most of the movements held in common a desire for simplicity and piety; the more extreme denied the need for a church altogether, and the very fringe movements were outright Manichean in their condemnation of the non-spiritual. In one sense the variety in this work is the effort of various heretical reformers to arrive at a form of ecclesiatical life most suitable for the restructuring of church life. The Englishman John Wyclif popularized the role of national identity and the \\"secular arm\\" in the reform of the church, a thrust continued a century later in Eastern Europe and with different emphases by Jan Hus. Leff attends to the philosophical influences of William of Ockham and Marsilius of Padua upon the political thinking about the place of the Church in civil society, and the social unrest of reformers turned millitants, such as the Lollards and the Hussites. .<br />A particular form of heretical life that captures Leff's attention are the mystics: Beguins, Fraticelli, Flagellants, and the Free Spirit movement, to name some. Leff notes that the mystics caused Church officials considerable worry, perhaps because implied in their practices and misshapen beliefs were the seeds of a more dangerous concept: freedom of conscience. The mystics represent the most tragic and in some ways the most shameful aspects of this work. The Inquisition was instituted to hunt them down, but Leff detects a papal ambivalent about mystics, particularly the Beguins. Thus, the most intense of persecutions by one pope would frequently be succeeded by a period of clemency and benignancy by a successor. <br />This work is not an easy read, and it is heavily documented with Latin texts, particularly the works of Olivi, Ockham, and minutes of Inquisition proceedings. It is worth noting that given the age of this work, the advanced student may wish to be aware of the continuing editing of original texts, such as the ongoing translation project of William of Ockham at the Franciscan Institute of St. Bonaventure University. And not surprisingly, other scholars have continued developed many aspects of this study, such as David Burr's recent work \\"The Spiritual Franciscans\\" [2001]. Age notwithstanding, Leff's comprehensive treatment of late medieval heresies remains a standard work for any serious student of the era looking for an overview of Church controversy and its impact upon modern day western Christianity.	2003-07-27

In fairness, this work is actually two autobiographies and a legal brief: \\"Dreamgirl\\" was the original autobiography of Mary Wilson, published in 1986, which covered the amazing run of the Supremes as a threesome through the 1960's. \\"Supreme Faith\\" was penned in 1990, partly with the intention of continuing Ms. Wilson's post-Diana Ross years, and partly as a critique of the music industry. And just so no one would miss the point, there is a 1999 epilogue of some length regarding the author's protracted legal battle to ownership of the name \\"Supremes.\\"<br />In the late 1950's middle-schooler Mary Wilson teamed with her Detroit neighbors Florence Ballard, Diane Ross, and Betty McGlown, to form one of the many neighborhood rock and roll vocal groups springing up in both black and white communities. It was an article of faith among all young dreamers of the time that singing groups needed to be foursomes, possibly because the music departments of the public schools indoctrinated students with the classical polyphonic harmonies: soprano, alto, tenor, bass. The group that would become the Supremes began as the \\"Primettes,\\" a little sister version of a popular Detroit male group, the Primes. The Primettes played school hops, primarily, and developed a loyal following as they themselves finished high school.<br />About the time Martin dropped from the group, the Primettes connected with an up-and-coming impresario, Berry Gordy, whose simple recording facilities housed in a private home would become the world famous Motown recording empire. In the early 1960's the Motown facility was a halfway house of sorts for genuine stars like Smokey Robinson and Mary Wells and those on the fringes struggling to make their bones. The author has mixed emotions of those formative years: she acknowledges that her tutelage under established performers and her experiences with the early primitive Motown road tours no doubt advanced her career. What she and her best friend Ballard did not particularly like was Gordy's reshaping of the Primettes.<br />Gordy, a pivotal character in this work, is remembered today as something of a cutting edge figure in the early days of Rock and Roll, a bulwark against the British Invasion, but in truth he had a good sense of the old black tradition of live entertainment, the so-called chitlin' circuit. Like all musical executives, he wanted and needed lucrative singles to keep the business afloat, but unlike his white counterpart Phil Spector, Gordy believed in creating acts with live appeal. What Gordy saw in the Primettes was the possibility to do both: create hits and market a stage act of three black women of stunning figures and Liberace wardrobes with crossover appeal to white audiences in Vegas and the Copa. Not surprisingly, Dick Clark and Ed Sullivan independently came to the same conclusion. Clark gambled and included the now Supremes on his 1964 summer tour before the group had a top hit; Sullivan would later feature the group nearly thirty times on his Sunday night show.<br />Gordy assessed correctly that Diane Ross's voice would sell the records. This was a setback for the author, and particularly for Ballard who at heart believed she was a better singer than Ross. Relegated visually and artistically to a backup role, the author has the good grace to concede that in the 1960's she herself was not an accomplished soloist. What she seems to resent is Gordy's clumsy and deceitful efforts to promote Diane-now Diana-and his open dislike of Ballard, whose alcoholism and tragic demise are detailed. The reader gets the sense that even now the author does not get the big picture. As late as the 1999 prologue, it had still not dawned upon the author that there was something much more terribly wrong with Ross than the character flaws she attributes to her.<br />Interestingly, when in early 1964 the Supremes, with the new arrangement team of Holland-Dozier-Holland, recorded \\"Where Did Our Love Go,\\" \\"Baby Love,\\" and \\"Come See About Me,\\" the songs that would jettison the group into pop music history, the author recalls disliking the songs as what would later be termed \\"bubble gum music.\\" There is irony in the fact that during the 1964-1969 years, when the Supremes seemed to match the Beetles hit for hit, the inner harmony of the three friends was deteriorating in direct proportion. Reading the account of the great years is a bit like sitting in the front ring of a prize fight: one gets a bit more sweat, spit, and blood than he bargains for. All the same, the first half of the book, the glory years, so to speak, is a valuable primary source, and to her credit, the author gives public attention to a fine cast of unheralded black writers, musicians, and choreographers whose contributions might have been otherwise lost.<br />The second volume, which begins with the departure of Ross from the Supremes in 1970, carries forward the same grudges and limited vision. The new Supremes enjoyed one good year, perhaps due to public antipathy against Ross. The author claims that the group's failure to thrive was due to Gordy's' unwillingness to promote the group and thus implicitly undermine Ross. That Gordy was capable of such pettiness is probably true. But the author is loathe to admit that on its very best day, the recreated Supremes were probably less entertaining than the latter day Three Stooges with Shemp Howard. It did not help matters that the author married an abusive husband and made him the group's business manager, alienating the last talented members. The author's final professional efforts to remake herself into a Holiday Inn lounge singer have an all too familiar ring to them.

And yet, like Dr. Yalom, the master of group psychotherapy, Dr. Shea is very good in his own published niche, the art and science of psychiatric assessment. Unlike Yalom's specialty,  Shea's work contains the elements of life and death. A superficial or faulty diagnosis can result at worst in suicide, homicide, or fatal medication reaction. Thus, while Shea is a funny and thoughtful man in his own right, his book is of necessity grave. Coupled with thoroughness, this gravity makes the work a standard referral source that should enjoy a long shelf life.<br />It is hard to imagine a better work than Shea's for psychiatric orientation. His working setting appears to be the emergency clinic of a major hospital in which the assessor must do a lot of things in a sixty minute time frame, though Part I [pp. 3-224] deals with such issues as subtle nonverbal behavior that seem more accessible in a leisured, office setting. With a somewhat undisguised distaste for present managed care practices, Shea assumes the worst of all worlds as to working conditions: a cold client, resistance, multiple diagnoses, soft signs, need for medication and follow-up treatment, and development of a working relationship or engagement with the client-all inside of sixty minutes and assuming the assessor has leisure to dictate later in the day.<br />There are several features of his teaching style that merit attention. The first is adherence to the DSM-IV. The publishers of this work purchased to right to reproduce those familiar \\"symptom boxes\\" verbatim and incorporate them into the text at appropriate points. The ease of use of these cross references in the text, and the author's lucid commentary on how to verbally elicit indications of the symptomatology call for special note. Second, Shea is a master of risk management. He leaves no stones unturned in his interviews in his efforts to determine suicidal or homicidal risk; or, in another vein, he garners from clients a near exact tally of daily drinking. Since reading the work, I have found myself asking patients about suicide as often as three different times in an interview, in various guises. [Shea `s \\"Far Side\\" sense of humor comes to the fore in his treatment of suicidal assessments; noting that psychiatrists and mental health professionals are all too human, he observes that assessors are less likely to probe for suicide and severe psychotic warnings at the end of their work shifts.]<br />A third characteristic worth noting is Shea's attention to the \\"soft signs\\" of an emerging psychosis. It occurred to me that, given the pressure of time upon psychiatrists, the non-physician practitioner [eg. psychotherapist, social worker] might actually have more exposure to the little indicators and trends than their harried colleagues: preoccupation with an incident in the distant past, infrequent loosenings of thought associations, inappropriate affect, etc. [p. 317]. This is an excellent work for non-physician providers who wish to collaborate with psychiatrists more succinctly and Shea's reflections upon the writing of clinical notes bears special attention.<br />As this is a second edition of an original work, there are a few additions that might prove valuable in future editions. One is an acknowledgment that many [most?] psychiatric evaluations for diagnosis and medication are not being done by psychiatrists. In my own setting, the client's primary care physician is the gatekeeper, and one can assume reasonably competent risk management skills among MD's in regular practice. But as one progresses further down the medical service food chain, it is not unusual to see bachelor's level personnel in public receiving facilities performing the very duties outlined by Dr. Shea in this text. As state funding of services becomes more acute, there will no doubt continue to be a \\"dumbing down\\" trend, with less qualified personnel being authorized to perform more delicate psychological services, such as assessments. Consequently, although Dr. Shea's present work is unquestionably thorough, it may be that future editions will need to assume less technical background and include more basic information, given that his target audience is the entire mental health community.<br />Along these lines, the construct of this work assumes a one-hour psychiatric assessment. One wonders if this is an optimistic time frame. In this corner of Florida, a 30-minute office assessment is the gold card of psychiatric care among private practitioners, Medicaid, and the better health care plans. The hour assessment appears to be the domain of the inpatient residential/involuntary population, sort of a closing of the barn door after the horses have gone round the bend. If indeed one must assess in a thirty-minute window, it would be interesting to get Dr. Shea's pecking order of urgencies from those cited in this work.

It is thus a delight to absorb the first two chapters of this book, a seventy-five page grand essay on the institution of the United States Senate and its role in the governmental process. This portion of the work should be required reading for citizenship and voting. We have here informative prose at its best, a walk through the various institutions of government, explaining how each is unique. In particular, Caro sets forth a primer on citizen expectations of the Senate. In so many words, he argues persuasively that the Senate, as crafted by our forefathers, was a masterful invention. Tragically, its lofty mission as the philosophic branch of government was derailed by Civil War and Reconstruction, so that by 1949 it was little more than a helpless giant held hostage by regional interests [notably the South] and business [notably utilities]. Like a dysfunctional family hiding abuse, the Senate was long on form and corrupt in substance, powerless to defend and uphold the basic constitutional guarantee of equality, justice, and voting rights.<br />That Lyndon Johnson would break this Gordian knot is almost beyond comprehension. Many reviewers have made note of Johnson's mixed motivations and psychology. Johnson's eleven years in the Senate did not, by any stretch of the imagination, render him more of a statesman and less of a wheeler-dealer. Caro's account of Vice-President elect Johnson's behavior in his last Senate days is almost comic. But the fact remains that in Caro's telling of the tale the 1949 edition of the sniveling servant senator of Texas oil and gas corporations was not quite the same man as the 1957 Senate Majority Leader who spearheaded passage of the first civil rights bill of the twentieth century. The author, a critic of Johnson's methods, gives Johnson his due and his place in history.<br />One of the primary building blocks in Caro's story is Richard Russell, the Georgia institution who orchestrated the Southern block of Senators. Having run unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1952, Russell, in the Caro scheme of things, transplanted his own aspirations to Johnson, who had carefully cultivated his relationship to Russell as practically a son to the father. Russell was thus willing to bring the Dixie Band along behind Johnson, convincing his southern neighbors that by giving Johnson latitude in dealing with the northern and liberal branch of the Democratic Party, they increased the chances of a Johnson/Southern presidential candidacy down the road. Thus it was that only Strom Thurmond filibustered the 1957 civil rights legislation.<br />Caro's \\"Russell Thesis\\" is essentially the backbone of the work. Without Russell, Johnson would have been no more successful as Majority Leader than his recent predecessors who had resigned into oblivion. I believe that Caro makes a very good case for this reading of senatorial politics through the 1950's. I do believe that the theory will not go unchallenged. For one thing, it assumes that the Dixie Democrats actually believed that Johnson was of presidential timbre, or for that matter, that they themselves would have wanted a Johnson Presidency. Johnson's Machiavellian methods and his borderline mania were hardly the stuff that would inspire confidence in a Stennis, Ellender, George, or any other card carrying Southern member of the country's most exclusive club.<br />As Caro focuses so heavily on the Johnson-Russell connection, it is hard to know what Russell's allies really thought about Johnson. When one considers that the tacit but primary legislative goal of most senators of the Deep South was preservation of the \\"Southern Way of Life,\\" [read segregation], a character of Johnson's sort might have served Southern senators as a diversion or political lightning rod. Certainly there was enough about Johnson to dislike, and any savvy senator,southern or otherwise, knew that Johnson's \\"walking around money\\" was not coming from the Sierra Club. Thus, while Caro emphasizes Johnson's power, he tends to underestimate the possibility that senators used Johnson for their individual or collective purposes as well. Russell, perhaps?<br />Many reviewers have noted the trail of people who paraded through Johnson's senate years. One who seems to have understood him well [if belatedly] was Richard Nixon. One gets the sense that if Nixon, and not the hapless William Knowland, had been Republican Minority Leader across the aisle, Johnson may have had a harder time of things. Another significant personage is James Rowe, the New Deal veteran whose personal advice, detailed memos, and political assessments were stunningly accurate in keeping Johnson on target for the White House. Certainly the Macbeth character in this drama is Hubert Humphrey, whose idealism and principle wrestled with ambition and insecurity. Johnson needed only to play him, not corrupt him. Somewhat invisible in this work-whether due to actual sickness or design-is John Fitzgerald Kennedy, an interesting omission. Caro's only record of Johnson's assessment of Kennedy was a kind of disdain for the Massachusetts' senator's chronic poor health; Johnson thought he was \\"sickly\\" and \\"yellow,\\" and not robust enough to run for the vice-presidency in 1956. [p. 646]<br />Much also has been written by reviewers about the book's length. Aside from the marvelously crafted opening, there is some validity to issues raised about its editing. And, there is a bit of a time warp for the reader who devoured the previous volume hot off the press in 1990. One needs to do a reacquainting with the Texas oilmen, for example, who fueled Johnson's political ambitions.

Hunt. To understand the actual dynamics that led to both the AFL and the Dallas Cowboys, for that matter, one is well advised to read Caro's \\"Master of the Senate,\\" in which Texas oil men in league with Senator Lyndon Johnson successfully manipulate pricing of oil and natural gas to amass unimaginable fortunes. Caro's description of Texas oil men-some of whom also funded Joe McCarthy's reign of terror-takes some of the awe and innocence from Gruver's account of the AFL's inception.<br />In 1959, when some of these oil men inquired after the NFL albatross Chicago Cardinals, venerable Bert Bell and the NFL did not wish to do business with them. Popular history [and Gruver] have it backwards: that the old conservative owners of the Redskins, Steelers, and Giants, among others, resented the modern upstarts, and only eventually accepted the idea of the Dallas Cowboys when absolutely forced to. In truth, any of the southwesterners were so conservative as to make Art Rooney look like Arlo Guthrie. The fact is that Bell, no fool, realized that the antitrust wolf was prowling around the NFL hen house, and recognition of franchises in Dallas and Minnesota was a small price to pay to make him go away. One can only imagine Bell's private disgust at being hoisted on his own petard, watching Texas oil interests, of all groups, threaten antitrust action.<br />The NFL expansion of 1961, modest as it was, left a string of frustrated suitors. In the long view of things, the fact that the late 1950's football entrepreneurs were fabulously rich established once and for all that whatever new league emerged would not be a dog-and-pony show. Prospective bidders for franchises would have to impress no less than the Hunt family with their solvency. With the notable exception of the Harry Wismer-New York Titans fiasco [later more than corrected by the Sonny Werblin consortium] the new AFL had more problems impressing critics than bankers. In its opening day clothes, the original AFL was a curious geographic imbalance, not surprisingly, tilted to the southwest. Boston and New York were courted for TV revenue, and those with long memories recalled that Buffalo had supported its 1940's pro team quite well.<br />But the banner teams-Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Oakland, and Denver-were two and three time zones west. From a television programming perspective, the new AFL mined a golden lode: a premier game in the Eastern Time Zone 4:00 P.M. slot where the NFL was generally signing off. Lamar Hunt, who for years had observed the ferocity of fan interest in Texas high school football, was able to convince ABC and then NBC, two networks eager to break CBS's stranglehold on pro football, that Americans would watch just about anybody play football if the time was right. It would be Nielsen ratings and popular opinion, not money, that would break or make the AFL.<br />Gruver's research of the business origins of the league is superficial. He relies on the popular misconceptions that have endured for over four decades, and adds little new by way of corporate analysis. Where he finds his comfort zone-not surprisingly for a professional sportswriter-is in his description of league play itself. There is a major implication here: the AFL, unlike other sports experiments, would not fold for lack of cash. Hunt, Hilton, Adams, Wilson, Werblin et. al. were not going to fold like cheap suitcases. If the league failed, it would be the brand of football on the field that brought it down.<br />Gruver's work is replete with descriptions of team characteristics, playing facilities, coaches and the like. Because of contractual problems-or the absence of major league sports in the new AFL cities-the playing conditions are a story unto themselves. Fullyhalf of the home fields appear to have been either below sea level or had previous lives as toxic waste sites. In some cities the only available playing sites were literally salvaged from the wrecking ball: in New York the Polo Grounds, or the infamous \\"Rock Pile\\" in Buffalo. Interestingly, with the exception of a Sid Gillman, one is struck in the early days by an absence of great coaches [or somehow we have overlooked the genius of Frank Filchock and Buster Ramsey over the years.] By the end of the work, one is compelled to admit that the coach who most brought respectability to the league, love him or hate him, was Hank Stram, with Weeb Ewbank a close second. That Stram also appears to be one of the primary sources is not surprising,<br />The strength of this work is in Gruver's recognition that the players made the league. Those who are old enough to remember the AFL will be happy to relive memories with Gino Cappelletti, Wray Carlton, Mike Garrett, Don Maynard, Paul Lowe, Ernie Ladd, Billy Shaw, Lionel Taylor, Babe Parilli, Jim Otto, Jerry Mays, Charlie Hennigan, Buck Buchanan, Larry Grantham, Daryle Lamonica, and Keith Lincoln, to name some. Gruver follows a chronological sequence and monitors the division races throughout the text. The memorable games are recalled, often using text from the actual broadcast. Thus we get Merle Harmon's and Sam DeLuca's raw impressions of the infamous Heidi game-by radio, of course, due to NBC's never to be forgotten cutaway to Klara and Goat Peter.<br />Gruver has done well with this effort, probably about as far as a sportswriter could take it. I am of a mind that the two great sports developments of the post World War II era, the AFL and NASCAR, both deserve a masterful scholarly analysis.

US	52709329	R143RR0CKH0VP8	0393038416	2636568	3: The Life of Herbert Hoover: Master of Emergencies, 1917-1918	Books	5	20	21	N	Y	The &quot;Clean Plate&quot; Czar	It is hard to imagine today, but there was a time not so very long ago when America came perilously close to running out of food. Three years of World War I, European pestilence, international speculation, and the imbalance of American farming and processing interests had taken their toll on the globe's food supply. In the spring of 1917 President Woodrow Wilson became painfully aware that the projected output of American grain and meats would not meet domestic and allied needs for the coming year of the war as the United States entered the fray. Having made the fateful decision to enter the war, Wilson went on to assume even greater powers: the appointment of a czar who would, in effect, tell Americans what and how much they could eat.<br />It did not take long to identify the candidate for the job. Herbert Hoover, the self-made mining millionaire who coordinated emergency food relief services for Europe during the first three years of the war, returned to America a hero and accepted Wilson's invitation to manage American food. Hoover's personal credentials were impeccable: magnificent administrator, philanthropist, and friend of business. While Hoover the man was acceptable to the Senate, his mandate-outlined in legislation known as the Lever Act-was another matter. The Senate refused to accept price controls, and sent Hoover on his way to battle with what it believed were sufficient restraints.<br />When one takes the long view of this work, the third volume of Hoover's biography, what gradually dawns on the reader is the sense that Hoover, with an international sense of the size of the crisis, was prepared to execute war powers in ways that had not been seen since Lincoln. Neither the Senate nor the business community had truly taken the measure of this man, though biographer Nash strongly implies that Wilson knew exactly what he was doing and was pleased with the results. Hoover, for his part, saved the western world from starving with a three pronged attack: he essentially usurped the authority of several cabinet departments, he mobilized public opinion, and he stretched the Lever Act through bureaucratic legerdemain into a virtual Magna Carta.<br />If Congress had balked at price controls on staples such as wheat and pork, Hoover found another means to achieve the same end. Having calculated modest prices for food staples that would avoid inflation and speculation, Hoover found provisions in the Lever Act permitting him to issue government licenses to farmers, granaries, packinghouses, mills and even grocers. Those who refused to operate within the Hoover price structure were refused licenses. To attempt to do business without a license was risky, because Hoover, for all intents and purposes, was also acting secretary of transportation, controlling rail and water priorities. Unions, farmers, and particularly the meat packing trust howled, but Hoover had prepared for that eventuality.<br />Hoover's heavy-handed methods worked as well as they did because he had wisely joined food conservation to war fervor. One of his first acts as food administrator was a public awareness crusade, pitched specifically at women, to limit portions of food served at meals, to designate national meatless days, to establish new ratios of flours for breads, etc. Millions of households signed pledge cards to observe the Hoover guidelines, and for a time a \\"clean plate\\" ethic seized the country. In the face of this domestic crusade, the whining of Swift, Armor, Wilson, and other food producers over reduced profits seemed petty and even unpatriotic. There were a sizable number of Americans who found the entire concept hokey, but Hoover was able to hold together his pantry army just long enough to see through till the end of the war.<br />There were, of course, many factors Hoover could not control. The British were not pleased with Hoover's mandate that they buy up excess American pork and acquire a taste for it. The army demanded more shipping space for combat troops, limiting Hoover's capacity to export. The winter of 1918 was among the worst in American history, creating massive delays in rail and shipping traffic. And, curiously, the end of the war arrived sooner than Hoover had planned, causing a glut in food supplies. That the war ended when it did may have been a political blessing in disguise for Hoover, for his magnificent balancing act was beginning to crumble. Congress and industry could be caged only so long. But in his eighteen-month tenure the food czar had essentially done what he set out to do: feed the western world without interruption and speculation.<br />One immediate question is: how did Hoover get away with this? One gets the sense that a lot of government officials rolled over and played dead during Hoover's heyday, such as the Secretary of Agriculture, David Houston. One answer may be that while most officers of government were at least dimly aware of the magnitude of the crisis, they realized that to do what was necessary-usurp commercial powers to an unprecedented degree-would involve the political suicide of the perpetrator, and they were happy to oblige Hoover as he took the fall. Interestingly, Hoover never seemed to have considered his tenure a political risk. On the contrary, he evidently saw his government service as his emergence onto the American political stage, and of course events would show this to be fortuitous. In its description of this tenure of Hoover's public service, the book serves up questions for the volumes to follow: How did Hoover regain his credibility in with Republicans, and major business interests in particular, such that he could be nominated for the presidency in 1928? Another: how did Hoover's wartime experience impact his presidential management of the Depression? And finally, would America of the third millennium accept a \\"temporary czar\\" in a national crisis such as the unleashing of weapons of mass destruction?  Put another way, is Hoover simply a historical anomaly or a paradigm for future crises?space for combat troops, limiting Hoover's capacity to export.

It is my sense that George Stephanopoulos feels something of the same, having entered politics to become the next Kenny O'Donnell or Jack Valenti. Alas for the author, there was no missile crisis or Viet Nam War on his watch. The White House is viewed in a much different light since 9-11 and the prospect of major conflict with Iraq and possibly North Korea. In retrospect, rubbing elbows with the Clintons, Leon Panetta, and even occasionally with Monica Lewinski, now seems like small potatoes. This is hardly the author's fault, but events since publication in 1999 have served to trivialize life in the Clinton West Wing. What is left is an interesting memoir but absent the gravitas it was once meant to convey.<br />Time and circumstances notwithstanding, \\"All Too Human\\" is still a fascinating read. Stephanopoulos served as senior advisor to Bill Clinton during the 1992 presidential primary and election, and during the first term of the Clinton presidency. He does provide interesting vignettes, but often with a sense of insecurity and fear of exclusion that led him to eventually seek psychiatric help and leave the pressure of the executive branch. To his credit the author does not shrink from owning his voracious opportunism, nor does he take undue advantage of his intimacy with the Clintons to share titillating information with the reader, though in his closing remarks, he does confess to a sense of being duped by Clinton's later admissions. One gets the sense that having served his time in the heat of the kitchen, he was only mildly disappointed to get out of it.	2003-02-09

Clinical success, in the author's view, is established the old fashioned way: you have to work for it. In his introduction Bernstein confesses to a basic distrust of quick fixes for teenage problems, particularly those promulgated on the lecture/workshop circuit. He keeps a balanced head on the etiology of oppositional defiance, recognizing that disorders of mood, substance abuse, and dysfunctional families of origin, to name a few factors, must be given their day in court during the diagnostic phase of treatment. He is well read in adolescent development and recognizes that the teen years are inherently about distancing and defiance, in some way, shape, or form.<br />If one were to label the author's clinical approach, perhaps the Rogerian style comes closest to capturing this practitioner's persona. Without losing sight of the nuts and bolts, Bernstein seems to find his success in establishing empathy and trust with his young clients. The \\"opposition\\" of teenagers is directed against the systems that they perceive as having failed them: family, school, and the peer community. The defensive attitude of such youth is both a mask for their pain and insurance against further hurt. It is encouraging to see that a lengthy chapter has been devoted to family intervention [though some family specialists will inevitably argue that the family organism is the whole enchilada where childhood disorders are concerned.]<br />Bernstein's clinical examples-and they are numerous-appear to be drawn primarily from individual therapy sessions, i.e., without parents or others in the process. If this reflects the demographics of his paying clientele, then he must have a remarkable gift for developing engagement with his young clients, and he would apparently have enough leisure to plumb his clients' psyches at a pace that does not engender defensiveness. But aside from the wearisome issue of whether managed health care or the client's own limited resources put limitations on a style that calls for protracted contact and trust building, the one nagging question left hanging in this work is the role of the parents in the client's treatment. In Chapter 12 the author provides a substantive commentary on family therapy, noting among other things that parents frequently repeat the mistakes of their own mothers and fathers, implying that many oppositional clients have plenty at home to be oppositional about. Is such therapy without the parents the clinical equivalent of rowing with one oar?  I would summarize Bernstein's position on parental participation in therapy as \\"optimal but not necessary.\\" As a practitioner myself, unless I have compelling reasons to the contrary, I subscribe to the philosophy of the seasoned general who brought a long time rival into his inner circle on the grounds that \\"I'd rather have him inside my tent [urinating] out than outside my tent [urinating] in.\\" Somewhat surprising to me is the desire of many of my ODD clients to have a parent in therapy with them, perhaps their way of telling me why they are so angry.<br />In the final analysis, this is a work from the traditional psychoanalytic school that extols the time proven methods of human respect and client interaction. It is an excellent didactic exposition, an opportunity for a practitioner to ask himself, \\"Do I sound like that?\\" There is an abundance of common sense and a minimum of psycho-jargon that makes this work accessible to teachers and many parents as well.om the wearisome issue of whether managed health care or the client's own limited resources put limitations on a style that calls for protracted contact and trust building, the one nagging question left hanging in this work is the role of the parents in the client's treatment.

It is the fourth in a series of collected correspondences, with this particular volume devoted to exchanges between the cloistered Catholic monk and man of letters [literally and figuratively] and a bevy of international writers, some famous, some obscure. It strikes me that this is a work for a rather limited readership. There is in truth very little exchanged in these letters about the art of writing per se and more about the meaning of the lives and trials of the writers themselves. Consequently, one would need to know a good deal about Merton for these letters to make sense, nor would it hurt to have a passing understanding of the place of Evelyn Waugh, Jacques Maritain, Ernesto Cardenal, Boris Pasternak, and Czeslaw Milosz, to cite some of the Merton correspondents.<br />Those who have read Merton's seven volume journal will not be surprised that these letters reveal to some degree Merton's double life: the loyal churchman who observes monastic rubrics to the letter while questioning the very credibility of visible church structure and its coziness with American pragmatism. There is a surprisingly lively exchange between Merton and the poet Clayton Eshleman, the one correspondent in this volume who seems to have put the monk on the defensive about his inner contradictions.<br />The majority of the letters are addressed to South American poets, particularly Ernesto Cardenal, who had been a novice under Merton at Gethsemanae. Merton, who experienced a religious conversion of sorts in Cuba before entering the Trappists, enjoyed a romantic ideal of life south of the United States, and his interest in Hispanic poetry and authors strikes the reader as part escapist and part anti-capitalist. One cannot help but smile at his frequently professed desire to join Cardenal's experimental island community, Our Lady of Solentiname, when in his journal he expresses near horror at the prospect of living in the jungle of South Carolina [Mepkin Abbey] where he would die among snakes and alligators.<br />Generally speaking, Merton's letters here serve three purposes. First, they allowed him to vent feelings and frustrations that the writer believed would be misunderstood or outright harmful if expressed in the context of his monastery. Or put another way, his literary correspondences proved to him that he was not swallowed whole by the monastic mystique. Second, Merton's correspondences to writers-many agnostic or of undefined religious persuasion-met his need to believe that his monastic secluded existence served some sort of spiritual and secular reform mission. As much as he denied it, Merton did indeed question the relevance of a purely solitary contemplative life in a powerful country, and he desperately needed to establish solidarity with those behind the Iron Curtain and under repressive political regimes. I believe Merton to be sincere in this regard, though on paper the sentiment appears fawning at times and he sounds like the classic Cadillac liberal.<br />And finally, Merton wrote letters to other writers because \\"Amazon.com\\" had not yet been invented. From his mountain hideaway Merton conducted a book and poetry exchange operation that actually provokes outright laughter. Consider that his mail was censored and sometimes withheld without his knowledge by superiors, that he wrote to countries with irregular postal service, that he did have access to several publishing houses, that some of his correspondents were as unfocused as he was, and that Xerox machines were not yet in general use. It is quite possible there are monks in heaven who can honestly claim that their life's work consisted of sealing envelopes and mimeographing for Father Louis. That one of Merton's monastery responsibilities included reforesting is truly a sign of God's sense of humor.olina [Mepkin Abbey] where he would die among snakes and alligators. <br />Generally speaking, Merton's letters here serve three purposes.

I believe Merton to be sincere in this regard, though on paper the sentiment appears fawning at times and he sounds like the classic Cadillac liberal.<br />And finally, Merton wrote letters to other writers because \\"Amazon.com\\" had not yet been invented. From his mountain hideaway Merton conducted a book and poetry exchange operation that actually provokes outright laughter. Consider that his mail was censored and sometimes withheld without his knowledge by superiors, that he wrote to countries with irregular postal service, that he did have access to several publishing houses, that some of his correspondents were as unfocused as he was, and that Xerox machines were not yet in general use. It is quite possible there are monks in heaven who can honestly claim that their life's work consisted of sealing envelopes and mimeographing for Father Louis. That one of Merton's monastery responsibilities included reforesting is truly a sign of God's sense of humor.	2002-12-07

Murrow was an aging icon without portfolio. He did not have the regular exposure of a Douglas Edwards, Chet Huntley, or David Brinkley. He would on occasion do spectacular work-as elementary school students we would discuss his \\"Harvest of Shame\\" documentary on the sufferings of migrant farm workers. But it was from our parents and older relatives that we inherited something of a sense of his importance in an earlier time, in the same fashion that they might speak of a Bob Taft or an Adlai Stevenson.<br />What we could not know in 1959, what biographer A.M. Sperber makes abundantly clear, is that we were watching the shell of a driven man who had exhausted his incredible stores of emotional energy to international cooperation, then to radio coverage of the horrors of World War II, and on to shape the formation of the CBS new department during the explosion of the television era and the age of McCarthy. Sperber traces the rise and decline of this charismatic, almost manic, entrepreneur from the most unlikely of origins, that of a lumberjack named Egbert who quickly realized the liabilities of his given name in the male work camps of Washington State.<br />Egbert, now Edward, chopped wood only long enough to scratch and claw his way into Washington State College. A student with fingers in many campus pies, he joined an organization called the International Institute of Education in 1931. The IIE in the early 1930's was a form of college student exchange program, one of its sponsors being the not-quite-ready-for-prime-time Columbia Broadcast System. When Murrow spoke at a West Coast gathering of IIE representatives, he earned himself election to the national office of the IIE in New York, a paid position there, and free air time on CBS radio. Murrow produced Sunday afternoon radio lectures and round table discussions, demonstrating a flair for attracting international speakers. As Murrow learned more about the plight of Jews in Germany from reporter [and later close friend] William Shirer, he used the machinery of the IIE in the United States to rescue as many Jewish intellectuals as possible and place them in American colleges. It was a tactic not universally appreciated, nor would his close cooperation with the Russians be forgotten by J. Edgar Hoover.<br />By the beginning of the Battle of Britain, Murrow was assigned full time by CBS to provide radio coverage of Hitler's assaults and to coordinate the company's European reporting network. It is impossible to capsulize here the horrors of those eighteen months for Murrow and for England generally, when every night brought a terror at least as awful as the World Trade Center bombing. Murrow created a network of European radio correspondents-many of whom would become household names in their own rights. He overcame industry biases against putting reporters on the air and using taped reports from the fields. But most of all, he revolutionized the very style of radio news into \\"factual storytelling\\" by his nightly accounts of German bombings that by happenstance occurred during the East Coast's prime time 7 P.M. radio news hour. Later, as the theater of war shifted east, Murrow was among the first western reporters to see first hand an operating extermination camp. He could not bring himself to talk about it over the air for several days.<br />Murrow returned to CBS in New York a conquering hero of sorts, the network's hottest property. Sperber does a good job in explaining why the postwar Murrow-CBS marriage was a stormy one. For one thing, the war years had reshaped Murrow into a cross between an Old Testament prophet and a posttraumatic stress sufferer. He would never be quite at home in an industry moving toward television, increased advertising dependence, and escapism. Secondly, Murrow was too much the prophet to claim objectivity. He would never be confused with, say, Bob Trout. Long before Woodward and Bernstein, Murrow crafted the art of investigative reporting for a presumably concerned nation, particularly through the medium of his weekly \\"See It Now\\" series, a rough and tumble forerunner of \\"60 Minutes.\\" His most controversial television piece, his hour-long exposure of Joe McCarthy, was out and out editorializing, albeit accurate. In Murrow's mind, he was serving the common good. Others were not so sure. Thirdly, Murrow himself had a past that made him a potential network liability. When he produced his \\"Harvest of Shame\\" documentary, for example, hardly a paean for capitalism, those with long memories would recall his enthusiastic embrace of Russian intellectuals in the late 1930's with the IIE.<br />The great irony in the breakup of Murrow and CBS is that the deciding infidelity may possibly have been unintentional. In 1960, with quiz show scandals threatening the credibility of the television industry, CBS President Frank Stanton announced a policy to eliminate the appearance of deceit in any of his network's programming, not just quiz shows. When pressed as to the extent of this policy, the network cited other programming, including rather surprisingly Murrow's own \\"Person to Person\\" prime time home visits to celebrities. In one reading of this event, Stanton may have simply been protesting the pre-scripting of interview questions and the staged walk-through of the homes. Or, there may have been a subtler message. A young Harry Reasoner inquired of Murrow on air, in so many words, \\"why are you, the Jeremiah of the industry, wasting precious prime time with the innocuous drivel of fighters and starlets?\\"<br />Unlike Reasoner and Howard K. Smith, who felt no compunction about switching networks, Murrow lived and died CBS. Illness and ultimately death interrupted his stint as window dressing for the Kennedy administration in 1965. Perhaps his prodigious cigarette smoking had finally claimed him. More likely, it was the pressure of living so many lives in one frail human shell.fused with, say, Bob Trout.

US	52709329	R3AYVO3J56XJ54	1586420399	213740100	Racing for the Bomb: General Leslie R. Groves, the Manhattan Project's Indispensable Man	Books	5	30	32	N	Y	A Long Fuse	As biographer Robert Norris himself concedes, there have been many accounts of the Manhattan Project since World War II, several biographies of Leslie Groves, and even Paul Newman's memorable depiction of Groves in the film \\"Fat Man and Little Boy.\\" Norris hoped to achieve the academically definitive biography, and no one can accuse him of failing at that. He is thorough. In fact, there is unintended humor in the \\"racing\\" title: as late as page 214 the search for real estate for Hanford and Oak Ridge is just getting underway. Groves's bomb has a long fuse.<br />Leslie R. Groves entered West Point on the eve of World War I. When the United States entered the war, the Academy's curriculum was compressed into a two year matriculation in the belief that many new officers would be needed quickly on the European front. As timing would have it, neither Groves nor many of his fellow cadets saw action. What resulted, however, was a glut of peacetime officers, an undesirable situation for ambitious career officers like Groves. Eventually Groves's accomplishments would outrun his rank, a major political liability. In the end, however, Groves himself was his own worst enemy. Intelligent and self-motivated, Groves became an accomplished engineer at the Academy, though it would seem that as a cadet he acquired the skills without the polish. As an officer in the Corps of Engineers he was brusque and dogged, except with those who could advance his career. Superiors tolerated his rudeness and obesity because he could kick behinds and deliver the goods. In peacetime he might have been shuffled out; but as the Nazi shadow extended closer to home, a man of Groves's productivity would be annually disciplined for his interpersonal shortcomings and \\"punished\\" with greater responsibilities. It was thus that Groves became a major force in the construction of the Pentagon, and ultimately a secret weapons project based in the New York District of the Army Corps of Engineers, the so-called Manhattan Project.<br />To the uninformed, Groves's contribution to the production of the atomic bomb was as scoutmaster for a collection of scientific mad monk geniuses in the desert of New Mexico. In fact, Norris leaves the impression that Groves was more of an absentee landlord at Los Alamos. The real action was going on elsewhere, primarily in massive industrial complexes at Hanford, Washington, and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In some respects the building of these two industrial facilities was as impressive as the making of the bomb. That Groves was able to build not one but two mammoth atomic factories in roughly eighteen months is staggering.<br />As Norris tells the story, Groves enjoyed a decent relationship with Robert Oppenheimer and most of the scientists working for him. He did not totally understand the intricacies of atomic physics; in truth, the entire project was a foray into the unknown.  Where he excelled was in translating theoretical problems into practical management components which he executed against incredible odds: shortages of rare substances and wartime civilian labor, secrecy and security, political and military infighting, and concern over the German nuclear program, to cite a few. When his scientists were divided over opposing theories and techniques, Groves's favorite stratagem was simply to test both possibilities in laboratory situations and select the one that worked.<br />Which raises the question of costs and accountability. The funding of this massive secret project is probably a good subject for a separate work. Suffice to say that Groves drew his funding from an extraordinarily large but innocuously named account, and that funding was one problem he did not have to face, at least until after the war. Conveniently, there was in fact no one-certainly not his [many] senior officers-who could question the wisdom of Groves's expenditures and management techniques. He answered, nominally at least, to a civilian board appointed by Roosevelt,which included James Conant, President of Harvard. But from this narrative the board's primary relationship with Groves appeared to be running interference.<br />After Japan's surrender, Groves exercised a proprietorship over the newly confirmed nuclear technology, and he would parcel it out sparingly and reluctantly. He advocated an American hegemony of nuclear weaponry-no international control of atomic bombs, no sharing of technology with allies-and even within America he embargoed information to most government agencies, including the White House. Groves protected the stockpile, and since the weapons were stored as component parts, Groves could obfuscate the true strategic strength of the American arsenal as political needs dictated. Norris contends that Groves forged much of this nation's current nuclear philosophy during and immediately after the Manhattan Project.<br />New technology notwithstanding, the old politics would eventually derail Groves. In 1948, during his annual fitness review, Groves was told by Dwight Eisenhower to his face that his maverick days were over and that he would not be appointed chief of engineers. Eisenhower, who regarded Groves as a loose cannon, made it clear that too many officers had been rubbed the wrong way by his arrogance. No fool, Groves submitted his resignation and spent several years with Remington Rand in the early years of computer development.<br />Norris depicts Groves's role in the atomic espionage trials of the 1950's in a benign light, [Gregg Herken's new work depicts the General's involvement in a darker light] and I suspect that the author's closeness to his subject made him somewhat less critical of Groves's tactics and style. Overall, this is an extremely valuable work for several reasons. \\"Racing for the Bomb\\" is a commentary on the pros and cons of national crisis management, the dilemma of giving someone enough power to get the job done without creating a dictator. There is also a message here about contemporary nuclear proliferation. Have India, Pakistan, Iraq, and North Korea mastered their own Manhattan Projects, or is nuclear proliferation simply a matter of espionage and horse-trading? One can almost hear Groves saying, \\"I told you so.\\", which included James Conant, President of Harvard.

US	52709329	R2HN7TS1J9IUG3	0394555090	951161016	Theodore Rex	Books	5	10	14	N	N	Bully Beautiful	It took courage to write this book. Everyone has an opinion about Teddy Roosevelt. How does the intrepid biographer navigate predispositions?<br />Edmund Morris made two critical decisions in preparing this work, and in retrospect both choices worked magnificently. The first was to devote the entire work to the presidency years, and nothing else. If you think this doesn't make a difference, consider a work about George W. Bush that omits his Texas Rangers' years and focuses exclusively on his responses to the terrorist attacks during his presidency. Morris adopts this strategy with Roosevelt: the work opens with the death of McKinley and ends with the inauguration of Taft. What we have here is the Rex, not the Bull Moose. What is lost in color is more than made up for in dignity; Theodore Rex is never without his scepter.<br />The second editorial choice of the author is the employment of straightforward narration with exquisite attention to detail. Certain of the classical languages have a verb tense termed \\"the historical present,\\" which combines narrative with immediacy. [The Gospel of Mark employs this style.] Morris's narrative has this storyteller feel to it without going over the edge. The attention to detail gives evidence of meticulous examination of memoirs, diaries and letters. The chirp of a sparrow on the window ledge accompanies the swearing of the presidential oath in Buffalo, as does an interminable human silence of two full minutes after the oath, save for the nearly inaudible mutterings of Mark Hanna.<br />In this straightforward style Morris describes a presidency marked by delicate balance. Roosevelt's progression through his seven years is marked by duality: he must keep the trust of Wall Street while presenting himself as a man of the people. He must be dutifully respectful of the Mark Hannas of his party while proving [to himself, among others] that he is his own man. He enjoys close intimate ties to friends and cultures of both England and Germany while both empires lumbered inexorably to war with each other. In his own family he had two distinct cultures, so to speak; he frolicked with his younger children while biting his lip at the antics of daughter Alice and her snake. He embraced exercise and the great outdoors despite a general tendency toward the Epicurean. Morris records without comment that whenever Roosevelt was presented a choice of entrees for breakfast, he inevitably chose both. Shades of the executive style itself.<br />Addressing the Roosevelt presidency in his existential way, Morris brings home the difficulties, dangers, and exasperations faced by a president who, from this distance of time, appears near invincible. He was nowhere near invincible then. Roosevelt feared for national security more than is generally realized. He was commander in chief of perhaps the world's sixth largest navy, and he spent plenty of time worrying about the other five. His passion for the Panama Canal was due in no small part to the impoverishment of the U.S. Navy, then barely a one-ocean fleet. A lot of what Roosevelt ranted really was bluff, and he knew it, with fingers crossed all the way. At times his swaggering was ignored, as in matters relating to racial justice, and he would back off in prudence or cowardice, depending upon one's readings of circumstances. But Morris does not make that decision for us, to his credit.<br />Fortunately for the American story, Roosevelt's approach to foreign policy was consistent, determined, and admittedly lucky. His muscular stance toward the world was part jingo and part survival, inspired by Manifest Destiny and tempered at times by Eliju Root. Roosevelt was acutely aware of national limitation, probably more so than most of his compatriots, and like a good general was more often than not successful in choosing the right terrain for his domestic and international battles so as not to squander the national capital. From our time he looks powerful; in his own day heknew the benefit of posturing and the importance of not being caught.<br />This is a robust work, all the more so when one considers what is not here: the colorful tales of Roosevelt's public ascendancy and decline, for example, or speculations on such matters as Roosevelt's support of Taft to succeed him. But Morris has chosen his game plan and remains faithful to the end. The reader's dilemma, and it is a big one, is deciding whether he is better pleasured or informed by the finished product. A strong case can be made for both.he knew the benefit of posturing and the importance of not being caught. <br />This is a robust work, all the more so when one considers what is not here: the colorful tales of Roosevelt's public ascendancy and decline, for example, or speculations on such matters as Roosevelt's support of Taft to succeed him.

Stitched together like a cheap baseball, the book is co-authored [and I blush to use the term] by Mrs. Grissom and Henry Still, a newspaperman turned aerospace executive. Collaborations work successfully when each partner brings out the best of the other; when they fail, the literary result is akin to fingernails on a blackboard. In this work the authors are almost at cross-purposes. Still, in many respects, is the gung-ho space reporter who uses the work as his opportunity to get a space history on the record. Even allowing for age, this is a shoddy history of the space program. Still allots a single paragraph for the entire Apollo 8 mission and runs far afield from the personal doings of the Grissoms, not one of whom ever created ball bearings in Skylab, although that mechanical feat merits mention in the author's opinion. Only God knows why.<br />And what of Mrs. Grissom? \\"The tragic and heroic story of her husband and family caught up in America's race for the moon,\\" as the cover proclaims, is told unevenly and superficially. I expected to encounter spleen from the wife of one of the space program's more perplexing, misunderstood, and maligned characters, and I would have said more power to her. Watch \\"The Right Stuff:\\" the Betty Grissom actress, with tears and rage, has it down pat as she screams \\"Are these the goodies? The military owes you, Gus, but they owe me, too.\\" The real Mrs. Grissom, when she can extricate herself from her collaborator's self-aggrandizement, tells a blunted tale of marriage to a man whose mistress is indeed the military and the hard drinking jocular goodies of the test pilot world. Perhaps no insight is more telling than her remark that she missed Gus's phone calls after the fire because, in essence, that was the sum and substance of their marriage. Her chief regret, it would seem, is that her boys had little of their father in his lifetime, and none after the fire.<br />The inner rage does make a brief appearance well after the Apollo fire. In 1971 Al Shepard and Pete Conrad tell her rather pointedly that as a widow she is no longer in the astronaut club, in that her money from the Life Magazine astronaut contract would be redirected to the living astronaut pool. Reasonably and profoundly affronted, she learned through a quirk of fate of two hungry young personal injury lawyers working out of a tiny office in a Seven-Eleven complex. And thus began a Quixotic $10,000,000 damage suit against North American Rockwell that covered three states in a frantic effort to outpace statute of limitations problems. The suit brought considerable national consternation toward Mrs. Grissom who was perceived as suing the country and the military rather than a private manufacturer of space hardware. [The other two widows, for reasons unexplained, declined to join her in the action] Hampered by lack of funds and the hard reality that astronaut Grissom himself had participated in preparation of his ship at Rockwell, the lawyers were happy to settle for $350,000: after expenses, each attorney pocketed $75,000. Betty Grissom received $60,000. Another shameful legacy of the fire.<br />The one redeeming element of this work is the hint of rich raw material. The film \\"The Right Stuff\\" draws substantially from scenes in the book, though it inflates them with steroids. The time is ripe for a scholarly and literary masterpiece on Gus Grissom, the second American in space and certainly the most star-crossed of the American astronauts. If Liberty Bell 7<br />can be rediscovered and restored, why not the Grissom legacy?e fire. <br />The inner rage does make a brief appearance well after the Apollo fire.

Curiously, the forces given birth at the beginning of the era proved to be so frightening that the Renaissance players rushed to euthanize them. The Renaissance did not wane so much as it was dismantled, like an errant atomic bomb, by scientists overawed by their invention.<br />Bouwsma examines sixteenth century European thought in piecemeal-philosophy, theology, politics, science, literature, the theater-and with Newtonian precision describes how the adventuresome Renaissance spirit smashed molds of dated thinking and psychological ordering. Then, in reaction to its own recklessness, the Renaissance mind either retreated to old certainties rehabilitated or domesticated its inventions into a more tranquil conventionality.<br />Historical essays of this sort can make for delightful reading. Boorstin's \\"The Discoverers,\\" for example, captures both the specificity and the poetry of scientific history. Bouwsma, unfortunately, errs on the side of specificity. The flow of the work reminds one of a lengthy receiving line where every great thinker gets a handshake and a bon mot, but soon it is time to move on to the next guest. This is not to say that some of the guests don't mingle excessively. The author has a warm spot in his heart for Shakespeare, Sarpi, Jonson, Hobbes, Hooker, Galileo, and in particular Bacon and Montaigne, who pop up dozens of times in the narrative. Regrettably, \\"pop up\\" is exactly what they do, to provide proof texts and anecdotal spicing. The reader who is not intimately familiar with Bacon, for example, will not get a significant taste of his thought.<br />This is most unfortunate, because I believe Bouwsma has at least scratched the surface of an interesting concept: the Renaissance as psychological event. From our vantage point the Renaissance looms as an unmitigated liberation. Bouwsma, on the other hand, implies that for every man who felt liberated, another felt terrified. The great irony is that frequently these were one and the same man, that few intellectuals were so dense as not to feel some fear at the rending of the medieval synthesis. There is no shortage of great Renaissance men in this work, but only a glimmer of their ambiguity.hand, implies that for every man who felt liberated, another felt terrified.

In his modest and understated way Frank Borman describes his career through the military, the astronaut program, and the private business sector. A genuinely honest man who embodied the best values of middle America, Borman commanded two of the most visible and critical flights of the early manned space program: the epic endurance flight Gemini 7 in 1965 and the stunning circumlunar Apollo 8 adventure of Christmas Eve 1968. Widely respected in NASA and government circles, he was selected to lead the investigation of the Apollo fire which killed his comrades Grissom, White, and Chafee. He was, in every respect, an upright military man who embraced the challenge of the space race with dogged tenacity.<br />So why, with every page, does the reader feel like he is moving inexorably toward a train wreck? Perhaps because Borman's candor compels him to chronicle the downside of his single-minded determination and doggedness. It is hard to say if the author intended to give us this psychological two-edged sword, or whether it is simply the fruit of honesty. In either case the clues are there: with every career choice, with every renewed commitment to NASA, Borman etched his name on the honor roll of American space heroes. And, in the process, insulated himself from family and society, with painful consequences.<br />Borman's personal world begins to unravel, ironically, at the time of his greatest triumph, the Apollo 8 mission to the moon. His wife Susan, already stretched thin by years as a dutiful military wife in the spotlight and totally unnerved by the Apollo 1 fire, drifted into the murky world of alcoholism. Borman admits that, totally absorbed as he was with the Apollo Program, he was completely out of touch with her drinking, relieved that at least his wife was not using prescription tranquilizers, then in vogue among astronaut wives. [Andrew Chaikin's &quot;A Man on the Moon&quot; describes Susan Borman's problems during Apollo 8 in much greater detail than Borman could bring himself to describe.]<br />Sadly unaware of the unfolding tragedy at home, Borman retired from the Air Force and proceeded to make the grand-daddy of all bad career choices, particularly considering the choices at hand. It is not clear from the text whether the author truly understood the complexities of Eastern Airlines' financial difficulties, or the character of the people he would need to do business with. Borman does concede that he knew next to nothing about unions, which would be his undoing at Eastern along with deregulation and a sagging economy. Despite his earnestness and hard work-and no one worked harder-the book ends at February 23, 1986, the night of the Eastern bankruptcy, a broken ex-astronaut crying in his wife's arms.<br />It is a troubling ending. It is also a reflection of the conundrum of the race to the moon. The United States would never have overtaken the Russians in the space race without men like Borman who sacrificed everything for the goal of national success. But this work reveals another side of the space race: how the race to the moon collected men like Borman, took those assets of steely self-determination, and turned them against the astronauts themselves. This is a cost of the Apollo Program that is rarely discussed, and we, like the dazed author at the end of the book, have to decide for ourselves if the cost was worth it.<br />This philosophical twist, perhaps unexpectedly, is the author's biggest contribution to space literature. Borman's account of his missions reveals little new material, and he remains too private a man to titillate the reader with his uncensored thoughts about, say, Jim Lovell, with whom he spent an eternity in the closest of quarters.

Dewey, the epitome of Manhattan Avenue politics to conservative Republicans, was himself born and bred further west than the venerable Robert Taft himself. A product of Owosso, Michigan, Dewey attended the University of Michigan, studying literature and law, all the while pursuing a career as a professional singer. It was music that brought him to New York, one of many surprises unveiled in Richard Norton Smith's biography of one of America's most prolific political campaigners.<br />Dewey was a capable enough performer that in 1924 he was booked for a solo performance in the cultural heart of America. In the audience was the noted music critic Deems Taylor. Taylor commented upon what he perceived as Dewey's contrived emotional stage effects, but this flaw was dwarfed by a more essential one: suffering from laryngitis, Dewey's voice totally shut down halfway through the program. A thoroughly mortified Dewey was forced to take stock of his career, and as a second choice he decided to pursue a law degree. Columbia University of the 1920's enjoyed a plethora of great legal minds, and even the frustrated singer came to develop a passion for law and the potential theatrics of the courtroom.<br />Dewey's rapid ascent through the law profession was abetted by two factors: his labors on behalf of New York City's struggling Republican party, and the patronage of George Z. Medalie, who would become Dewey's legal and political rabbi. Medalie, a major character in this treatment, enjoyed a thriving private law practice, but he was drafted for one of the city's frequent, and usually unsuccessful, forays against organized crime, which literally held New York in a stranglehold in the 1920's and 1930's. Medalie, who had once consulted for Dewey's firm, brought this \\"prodigy\\" into his investigations of the seamy criminal underbelly of New York including, as it turned out, the disappearance of Judge Crater.<br />Not even Medalie could have imagined what kind of courtroom tiger he had unleashed. It was to Dewey's advantage that few intrepid souls wanted to tackle the dangers of addressing organized crime, particularly when corruption pervaded the police department and the courts. Dewey became New York City's district attorney in 1935, prosecuting famous gangsters, politicians, and public figures with a take no prisoners approach. Smith describes several of the most famous investigations in considerable detail, but it is Dewey's style that is most intriguing: a workaholic perfectionist whose \\"when in Rome\\" style and prosecutorial armtwisting were not for the prudish. Dewey's face became one of the most recognizable in America-through newspapers, newsreels, and a series of Hollywood B-movies in which Dewey lookalike actors reenacted the more famous of his investigations.<br />After the substantive defeats of Hoover in 1932 and Landon in 1936 many Republican voters in the 1940 primaries turned to the fresh aggressive look of Dewey. By May 1 Dewey stood at the head of the pack, but May 1940 proved to be his undoing. Smith observes that it was not a Republican challenger who derailed Dewey's victory train, but Hitler himself. After the disaster of Dunkirk, Dewey became \\"the first American casualty of the Second World War,\\" as one wag put it at the time. As the war came visibly closer to American life, Dewey's youth and limited international experience became glaring obstacles to his White House hopes. Defeated for the nomination by Wendell Wilkie, Dewey captured the New York state house in 1942. A genuinely compassionate man, Dewey's lengthy tenure as governor was marked by fiscal conservatism and social reform. His vision was remarkable: he predicted the postwar housing shortage and developed a state surplus for postwar needs. He saw the fiscal possibilities of a better highway system and sowed the seeds for what would become the interstate highway system by his advocacy of the New York State Thruway, which now bears his name.<br />Had Dewey's ambition been quenched in Albany, he would probably be remembered as one of the most effective state leaders of the century. Regrettably for his posterity, it is his unsuccessful runs for the presidency in 1944 and particularly 1948, when he \\"snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,\\" that most Americans associate with Dewey. Smith does not psychoanalyze the 1948 event, as many historians do, nor does he demonize Truman, whom he credits with conducting a masterful if brutal campaign. Smith concedes that Dewey's 1948 campaign was too ethereal, but in the final analysis Dewey was a victim of himself. Like Nixon, he was not a natural gladhander, and his perfectionism in crafting his speeches not only resulted in a wooden product but devoured time better spent in personal appearances.<br />Smith describes Dewey's personal life as that of, well, a rich suburban Republican. Early in his career Dewey made the acquaintance of journalist Lowell Thomas, who gradually drew him into the social circle of Quaker Hill, an exclusive mountain community near Pawling, New York, north of the city.  Dewey remained a presence in Republican circles until his sudden death by heart attack in 1971. He labored to keep his party moderate, campaigning vigorously for Eisenhower and against the Taft wing. Smith brings to light several interesting anecdotes of Dewey's later years. In 1970 a coterie of leading congressional Republicans, deeply concerned about the style and direction of the Nixon White House [read Haldeman and Ehrlichman], nominated their former party leader to speak privately with the president. Dewey apparently agreed to approach Nixon, but his sudden death intervened. Smith also records that the widowed Dewey courted Kitty Carlisle Hart [then a panelist on the popular TV program \\"To Tell The Truth\\"] and asked her to marry him. [The question was still under negotiation at the time of his death.] On the last day of his life, in Miami, he played golf with Carl Yastrzemski.

US	52709329	RBL0HON9HBART	0688077943	572140372	Florence Harding: The First Lady, the Jazz Age, and the Death of America's Most Scandalous President	Books	5	12	14	N	Y	Living Vicariously	Carl Anthony reports in his prologue that the inspiration for this project came from none other than Alice Roosevelt Longworth, one of Florence Harding's collection of mercurial and dysfunctional friends. That fact alone speaks volumes about the tenor and atmosphere of the story. Perhaps aware of America's antipathy toward \\"The Duchess,\\" Anthony has given this work a title worthy of an Oliver Stone epic. The reader who gets past the burlesque title will discover an intensively fascinating narrative of a driven, unconventional woman intertwined with a malleable young newspaper editor. When, years later, the Duchess would tell her \\"W'urrn\\" that she had made him president of the United States, many of their contemporaries would have agreed.<br />Born in 1860 to an Ohio businessman who wanted a son, Florence was in fact raised as a boy until her fourteenth year, when her domineering father realized that what he had actually created was a feminist with an attitude. He struck back ferociously and physically; Florence eventually retaliated by having herself impregnated by a hayseeder several years her junior. Christmas Day of 1882 found the young mother homeless and abandoned. Anthony takes the time to access the options available to this intelligent, ambitious, but impoverished woman. Determined to not disappear into rural Ohio obscurity giving piano lessons, Florence makes two critical decisions that would change her life forever, for better and worse: she gave her child away, and she set her cap for the man through whom she could make her mark in the public forum. On the surface these seem like cynical strategies, but with feminist sympathies Anthony takes pains to remind the reader that American business and politics were both male bastions in the Gilded Age. There were few routes for a woman of ambition.<br />Florence married the handsome and randy Warren Harding and immediately took over the operation of his local paper, turning a handsome profit and expanding the couple's business ventures. Anthony lets his facts carry the story: the Harding marriage is clearly one of convenience, arguably Florence's more than her husband's. Unencumbered by children, the Duchess, as she came to be called for obvious reasons, had time to consort with the political beat writers and politicians who came to Marion. She tended bar at their poker games, plied them with liquor for information and party gossip, and strategized a grand design for her husband's career in Ohio Republican politics. Managing Warren Harding was a full time job. He was not by nature ambitious, he was not a particularly good businessman, and he was not physically or mentally well, having suffered nervous breakdowns and indications of cardiovascular disease. His most obvious flaw-and one particularly odious to his wife-was his womanizing, which continued virtually to his death, with little concealment, and occasionally on the sly with her best friends.<br />For two people as different as Warren and the Duchess, it is surprising that they shared one common fatal flaw: they were both dreadfully poor judges of character. For all her intelligence and savvy, the Duchess became dependent [perhaps co-dependent] upon two outright rogues, Charles \\"Doc\\" Sawyer, her personal physician, and a gypsy fortune teller, Madame Marcia, both of whom exercised excessive influence throughout the entire Harding Administration. There is a sense in which Florence becomes more insecure with her greater success: Anthony describes her as weeping on Warren's Inauguration Day because of Madame Marcia's prediction that the new president would not live out his term.<br />Writing about a president's wife inevitably involves detailing the president and the presidency itself. Anthony does a creditable job in paying appropriate attention to Teapot Dome and Veterans Affairs scandals, for example, but in ways that keep the focus of the narrative on Florence and other political wives--Grace Coolidge, Emma Fall, andthe aforementioned Mrs. Longworth, for example. The later unraveling of the Harding Administration has obscured the activism of the First Lady; Anthony reminds us of the Duchess's emotional investment in women's rights, veterans' welfare, animal rights, and international peace.<br />Anthony takes the position that the fateful 1923 \\"Alaska Trip\\" was essentially the First Lady's act of self-promotion. Ostensibly, the President's lavish cross continent tour was undertaken to rally political support at a time when congressional investigation of the executive branch was accelerating. The author's narrative of the trip forms a good portion of the book and deservedly so. Warren Harding was depressed and ill as the presidential train left Washington and journeyed across the continent. After innumerable speeches and rallies, the party sets sail from California to Alaska, traveling overland to sites that have probably not seen a president since. Although Anthony debunks many of the myths about the trip, the facts are strange enough-the presidential vessel collided twice with other vessels, and several members of the party were killed in various accidents.<br />The great mystery of the trip among conspiracy buffs is what [or who?] killed Warren Harding. In one sense the answer is simple enough-the trip exhausted the president to the point where he either suffered a stroke or heart attack in San Francisco. That we cannot say for certain is due to the Duchess, who permitted only Doc Sawyer to treat her husband. Sawyer's incompetence is excelled only by his arrogance; when Herbert Hoover fetched a renowned cardiologist from Stanford to the president's bedside, Sawyer, who was treating the chief executive with questionable purgatives, would have nothing to do with him.<br />For a veteran of the journalist profession, the Duchess's management of the news of the President's death was poor, and veteran reporters at once smelled cover-up. Most likely her immediate concern was the reputation of Sawyer, and she refused permission for an official autopsy. But her greater worry was the legacy of her husband; she spent weeks burning his official papers and personal correspondence.

US	52709329	R30Y6DQQXJ92VI	0385493282	556829614	The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Popular Wisdom Takes A Beating	Not only is this one of the finest historical biographies to appear in the past several years, but it is also a work that if taken seriously will reshape the popular notions of both the man Ben Franklin and the psychology of the American Revolution. H.W. Brands has made it forever impossible to conceive of Franklin as just an eccentric scientist and colonial sage, or of the American Revolution as a dispute over the price of tea. Prepare yourself for a barrage of paradigmatic shifts, all of them credible.<br />The first shock to the system is the very length of Franklin's life. He who would joust with Vergennes, Adams, and George III was born in 1705. His first foray into public controversy involved, of all people, Cotton Mather, who found the Boston newspaper of the Franklin Brothers a bit too racy for the stern capital of Puritan mores. Although he would later be credited as the inventor of lightning rods, efficient stoves, and bifocals, the 16 year-old Benjamin also invented the first \\"Ann Landers Column,\\" assuming the persona of an older woman dispersing worldly advice to the lovelorn. Boston, not surprisingly, would prove too provincial for the young free-spirited Franklin, who also strained against the familial control of father and older brother. Two choices stood before him: the sea or Philadelphia. As an aspiring printer, Franklin judged Philadelphia the more congenial option. Mather breathed a sigh of relief, no doubt.<br />Brands traces Franklin's remarkable business success in the City of Brotherly Love. Franklin made a lot of money. Literally. In an age without public mints, the printing of currency was put out to lucrative bidding. Franklin, who sojourned in England briefly as an apprentice printer, had observed the English custom of printing from copper engravings, a method that foiled the efforts of counterfeiters. Franklin soon became a dealer in colonial currency, and his subsequent political connections led to government contracts for mail delivery as well. By the age of forty Franklin's incomes from printing and mail delivery were virtually a sinecure allowing him to retire to a life of scientific inquiry, invention, and public service.<br />Although Franklin's experiments with lightning and other forms of electricity would make him world famous, it was his civic contributions that proved most useful to Pennsylvanians. As French inspired Indian raids brought gruesome slaughter closer and closer to urban Philadelphia, Franklin organized a militia and arranged for the purchase of armaments from other colonies. As a loyalist for the British Crown, Franklin took pride in his own military achievements in the French and Indian War. He understood, as perhaps few others did, that the united force of American/British arms would in effect create an almost impregnable English basin of the Atlantic, and his vision of future glory for the British Empire knew no bounds.<br />After the defeat of the French he was only too glad to volunteer for what would become a nearly three decade sojourn of overseas service. The Pennsylvania assembly, long frustrated by the paternal and heavy- handed dealings of the Penn family, dispatched Franklin to London to seek redress against the Penns from Parliament. Arriving in England Franklin was indeed welcomed by the intelligentsia, but he could not have imagined the attitude of Parliament and the Crown against American colonists. Very few things surprised Franklin as a rule, but he could hardly have expected that his strenuous efforts on behalf of the Crown during the French and Indian War would be interpreted in England as insolent, disobedient, and even treacherous. Franklin was rudely treated in the halls of Parliament, but perhaps equally disconcerting to him was the so-called John Wilkes uprising, when a band of hooligans literally took control of the streets of London while the royal government cowered in terror. The Wilkes affair took the luster off of monarchical government and brought home to Franklin the effectiveness of what he and others had achieved in maintaining public order in Pennsylvania.<br />Brands is careful to portray Franklin as level headed to a fault. The changes in Franklin's thinking about America--from its status as most loyal of colonies to an independent nation in its own right-is steadied, an evolution in small incremental steps. As late as 1770 Franklin still entertained hope of union. Eventually realism and pride, along with a concern for his personal safety, led him to return to America in time for the early volleys of the Revolution. But Franklin's understanding of the European scene made him a logical choice to return overseas, first as ambassador to the French and later as a peace commissioner with John Adams and John Jay. The interplay of these three diverse statesmen is intriguing, but the story has been told in a number of other biographies and histories of the war.<br />Franklin would return to America, and when the time arrived to choose America's first chief executive, the Sage of Passy was nearly 85 years old. Did anyone take a Franklin Presidency seriously?  Brands lets the idea dangle, perhaps in sport, but he does make note of the fact that Franklin was widely recognized as smarter than Washington, less threatening to those who worried about a military aristocracy, an accomplished civil administrator, and familiar with all of the major European powers. But then Brands dashes this whimsy with water-specifically, the bath water from the shoe-shaped tub where Franklin spent nearly all of his waking hours nursing an agonizing stone. One gets the sense that even the devoted biographer found the visual picture of old Franklin governing naked from the tub a bit too much theater for a new nation struggling for respect. The Franklin brought to life by Professor Brands would have enjoyed the laugh himself.ught home to Franklin the effectiveness of what he and others had achieved in maintaining public order in Pennsylvania. <br />Brands is careful to portray Franklin as level headed to a fault.

Burdened with all those term papers he never had time to take a wife, and now, well into his 40's, he is a credit-rich but lonely man who in his retirement takes on eccentric and challenging investigation work for equally eccentric employers. It is in this capacity that he crosses the pond to Ireland to investigate Nora MacDonaugh.<br />Nora is either very wicked or very unlucky. She is also very rich. The Dublin Police Department believes she slept her way to the money, its curiosity more than roused by the untimely deaths of both of her husbands, the latter blown to bits in his study. Innocent or guilty, she is extremely smart, and with modest effort this attractive widow becomes emotionally invested in the lovelorn McCarthy.<br />By happy coincidence the good Bishop John Ryan is vacationing in the safety of his hip nieces on the Emerald Isle. How to describe his role in this caper? Well, he is there, offering an occasional witticism, restaurant review, or forensic jab. He has a \\"call me if you need me\\" role to play in this novel. One gets the sense that he knows how this drama will play out from the get-go but that he does not want to ruin McCarthy's fun, so to speak.<br />There are enough mysteries here to please almost anyone. Will Tim McCarthy lose his objectivity to the charms of the luscious Nora? Will they actually \\"do it?\\" Is Nora stringing him along to divert him from the terrible truth? Does she deserve the Dublin Police moniker, \\"Miss Yo-Yo Pants?\\" [So help me.] How do two very unhappy families, an Irish terrorist, a Dublin pol, and an upstart Irish cream company play into the picture? And does Bishop Ryan eventually get a bigger role in the story than Zorro's mute compadre, Paco?<br />It's not MacBeth, but it's a pleasant enough read, with or without the Bailey's.	2002-02-27

Too much emphasis upon the Dodgers-Yankees-Giants rivalry of the 1950's would have produced a superficial sketch of 1950's baseball, already more than adequately recounted by David Halberstam, among others. Worse, the author might have adopted an \\"Angela's Ashes\\" style of dramatizing a childhood that was in fact comfortable middle class living in post-War Long Island. Or much worse, we might have gotten yet another \\"growing up Catholic\\" Gothic tale of terror.<br />Doris Kearns Goodwin found the proper balance, so that the uniqueness of this work rests not upon her description of baseball, the Eisenhower administration, or American Catholicism, but upon a surprisingly intimate portrait of her childhood that reveals more of her personal mysteries than perhaps she herself realizes.  The cultural institutions she highlights-particularly baseball-are in reality the metaphors by which she discovers herself and invites us to share in those discoveries. That the author is an American public treasure-an author of note, the congenial presidential scholar who shares titillating historical gossip on national TV with the likes of Tim Russert and Don Imus-gives us more motivation to follow her psychological musings.<br />\\"Wait Till Next Year\\" is a memoir of the author's childhood between the ages of five and twelve, roughly 1949 through 1956. Doris Kearns was the last of three daughters of Michael and Helen Kearns. Michael Kearns commuted to New York on the Long Island Railroad and made very decent money as a middle level bank officer; he owned a home in Rockville Center, and poverty was never a factor in the author's upbringing. Doris Kearns did well in school, had lots of friends, and objectively speaking, enjoyed the benefits of robust American prosperity.<br />All the same, her childhood was marked with sadness, fear, and trauma. Some of these features were cultural: the author recalls recoiling from a televised picture of Joe McCarthy, crouching on the floor during an atomic bomb drill, and avoiding public places for fear of polio. But her major crosses were within the family, and specifically involving her mother. Helen Kearns, we learn gradually, is wasting away. In many understated ways the author chronicles her decline-her mother's need for silence and naps, her pallor and angina attacks, her inability to do strenuous things that other mothers did with and for their daughters. Young Doris Kearns confesses to a very natural ambivalence-worry about her mother's life coupled with resentment over her mother's limitations.<br />Those who do not follow baseball do not have an appreciation for the psychological grounding it provides its followers in times of stress. Doris was introduced to radio broadcasts of timeless baseball by the time she was five, and soon after she mastered the art of official scoring in a red score book purchased for her by her father, who kindly shielded from his daughter the fact that all of New York's many newspapers carried the box scores for public consumption. Doris thus enjoyed the satisfaction of replaying each afternoon's games for her father as he sipped his evening cocktail. She attributes this experience with implanting the basic skills of research and story telling, the prerequisites for an up-and-coming historian of note. The author's substantive emotional involvement with \\"Dem Bums,\\" the Brooklyn Dodgers, was in fact the tonic that helped her weather the cultural and familial storms of her youth. And the bonds established between father and daughter through the medium of baseball helped her to forgive him in her later teen years when her father's grief led him into a period of gross insensitivity to his daughter's needs.<br />I found myself more than a little envious when I learned in the epilogue that the author, by now the famous Dr. Kearns-Goodwin, literally reconstructed her old neighborhoodin middle age through a meticulous search of records for her old Rockville Centre chums, whose interviews enrich the telling of this very personal tale. I understand her motivation as I progress through middle age. We are always in dialogue with the child within us, or at least the child we think were. What hinders us most often is a lack of information, and what we desire is a pilgrimage backward to legitimate past experience. This work at hand is Doris Kearns Goodwin's journey into her past. It was certainly not a painless adventure. But in turning the final page, the reader is pleased that at least one child-adult was able to cross to the other side and go home again.rhood in middle age through a meticulous search of records for her old Rockville Centre chums, whose interviews enrich the telling of this very personal tale.

For the reader who plans to tackle one biography of Adams in his lifetime, this work will certainly fit the bill. But in fairness it must be noted that Adams has not suffered from literary neglect prior to McCullough. In fact, Page Smith's two-volume 1962 biography is a classic, and John Ferling's 1992 offering is crisp and informative. Adams is also a central character in Richard Morris's \\"The Peacemakers\\" [1965] and Elkins and McKitrick's \\"The Age of Federalism\\" [1993].<br />McCullough's work is as good as any of those mentioned, but it is not a quantum leap forward, either. Abigail Adams, one of colonial America's truly remarkable women, enjoys a well-deserved preeminence in this version of Adam's life. But on the whole it is safe to say that Adams, much like Washington and Jefferson, defies the attempts of even the best historians to restrain him within the covers of a single opus.	2002-01-04
US	52709329	R1ZEQAMMB1SRUC	006018471X	530183235	Abandon Ship!: The Saga of the U.S.S. Indianapolis, the Navy's Greatest Sea Disaster	Books	5	5	6	N	Y	Old Tale, New Outrage	It is a tribute to \\"Abandon Ship\\" that fully 43 years after its first appearance this work has been reprinted and marketed for a new generation. For nearly half a century Richard Newcomb's straightforward account of the sinking of the Indianapolis served as a rallying point for the four hundred American sailors who survived nearly a week of terrible exposure in the South Pacific, as well as for a small but determined group of supporters and politicians who have maintained that the U.S. Navy's inquiry into the matter was nothing more than scapegoating and administrative whitewash.<br />It did not hurt the book nor the cause of the Indianapolis survivors that Hollywood later told the story in dramatic fashion. In the 1975 movie thriller \\"Jaws,\\" the salty shark hunter Quint reveals to his crew during a late night bender that he himself was a survivor of the torpedo attack that forced 1100 American sailors into the tropical waters of the South Pacific. Typical of the bad luck that has dogged the Indianapolis for years, Quint's cinematic narrative is rife with errors: most of the sailors died of exposure, not shark attack; the Indianapolis had already completed its mission of delivering the atomic bomb to Tinian at the time of its demise; and the ungodly delay in rescue operations was not due to security concerns, as Quint believed, but rather to communications and operations snafus.<br />Newcomb's original account of the sinking of the Indianapolis is drama enough. The Indianapolis had completed the delivery of the two atomic bombs to the island of Tinian and was en route to Leyte for routine training when it was cut in half by two simultaneous suicide torpedo strikes launched from a Japanese submarine. The ship sank within fifteen minutes, but under existing naval policy, its failure to reach Leyte was not noted for five days, delaying the dispatch of search and rescue craft and causing hundreds of unnecessary deaths. Perhaps because of these operational flaws in its command structure, naval inquiry not surprisingly shifted attention to the twin questions of whether the commander had demonstrated negligence in not taking evasive actions and later in failing to issue an \\"abandon ship\\" command.<br />Newcomb, working with material then available, is unequivocal in his judgment that the Navy's sanctions against Commander Charles B. McVay and other officers were politically motivated and brutally unfair. It is hard to imagine that the U.S. Navy actually procured the commander of the Japanese submarine to testify against McVay. Newcomb suggests that the visibility of the ship's atomic mission, as well as the tragedy's proximity to V-J Day, may have been precipitating factors in these unusual disciplinary proceedings.  He portrays McVay as a competent officer whose very conservatism would make him an unlikely candidate to veer from the standard operations book for unnecessary risk.<br />The injustice of the Indianapolis tragedy-the excessive loss of life and the misplacing of blame-emerged from time to time into the public consciousness for some years after the book's 1958 appearance. McVay, a stoic man, committed suicide in 1968. In the late 1990's investigative reporter Peter Maas stumbled upon the Indianapolis story while researching another naval tragedy. By this time Newcomb was retired in Florida, but Maas discovered that his book was revered by the 160 or so Indianapolis survivors still alive. In the reissue of this book in 2001, Maas adds both a new introduction and a lengthy chapter summarizing his own examination of declassified documents and a new congressional investigation that concluded in October 2000. He notes ruefully that even at this late date the Navy lobbied the Senate for a sanitized resolution that in essence exonerated both McVay and the Navy.<br />\\"Abandon Ship\\" is a gripping tale. Aside from the fact that Newcomb has [at times awkwardly] included the name, rank, and history of just about everyone on the ship, the story moves at a compelling clip. It is a tribute to the author's fairness that the reader is compelled to weigh conflicting evidence in the matter of weather conditions, available intelligence, and navigational options available to McVay. Maas, not surprisingly, reflects a more rough and tumble contemporary journalistic style than his genteel predecessor, but there are no ugly fault lines in the text. Neither investigator fully penetrates naval or congressional skullduggery, in 1958 or 2000, but both do their best to force some measure of public accountability. One cannot read the book today without thoughts of September 11, 2001. \\"Abandon Ship\\" is a sad reminder that not every national tragedy has been met with the equanimity that becomes America., the story moves at a compelling clip.

It is a surprisingly pedestrian work that bears all the earmarks of someone rushing to get his story on the record before it is too late. The tales of NASA, as recounted by its quintessential middle manager, reveal little new material and in fact are better narrated elsewhere.<br />Sadly, there is a mean-spirited side to this book that shadows Kraft's considerable personal achievements. A manager with a better sense of humor might have produced the \\"Dilbert\\" side of the space race. Instead, \\"Flight\\" is a steady drumbeat of carping about those who got in the way-whether they be politicians, the military, medics, scientists, the Russians, the astronauts, designers, or the press.  In its own strange way this is a book of revisionist space history-just to let you know that whatever Scott Carpenter, Gene Cernan, Jim Lovell, Walt Cunningham, or even Deke Slayton have put out in television or print, Craft is there to deflate, correct, contradict.

This is a stew of interesting geologic research and  weather-related historical reveries without a convincing scientific framework.  Although the book attempts to connect long range weather trends [in this instance, chill] with historical-political consequences, the author really succeeds in making the case that weather episodes are much more problematic than centuries-long trends. If anything, the reader is relieved of a fear of climactic Armageddon, as most of the weather catastrophes described by the author would be ameliorated today by better forecasting. And after several hundred pages of the evils of cold weather, the closing chapter on Global Warming appears as a welcomed friend.	2001-10-09

The answer is a resounding yes. Albrecht Holsing never forgets that he is writing a biography, not a physics text. The result is a colorful biography of a learning disabled civil servant with perhaps the most fertile imagination in the history of science. Holsing's Einstein is a man without a country, an unabashed lover, an avowed pacifist, a born-again Zionist, bon vivant and alleged subversive. And yes, smart and eccentric as hell.<br />Between 1905 and 1920 Einstein, a patent claims inspector, produced a series of papers on the subject of physics so outlandish that the world collectively gasped. Put simply, Einstein postulated connections between dimensions that had been considered unbridgeable until his day. He was not a scientist in the way we traditionally think of the discipline. He was in reality a science fiction writer who challenged the white coats to prove he was wrong. Most of the time they could not, to their own amazement. And when they did, he seemed to delight even more. God, he remarked, may be mysterious, but never malevolent. For Einstein the universe was a playground.<br />Einstein enjoyed wonderful timing. By 1900 the telescope and the microscope had been perfected to the point that the bigness and the smallness of the natural world began crashing into the complacency of Newtonian physics and Euclidean geometry. Einstein, whose own spacial-temporal development was delayed until early adulthood, began to play with possibilities. Is the universe so big that the traditional absolute theorems of geometry might be disproved? Consider the classic geometric postulate that two parallel lines will stretch into infinity without ever touching. Einstein dared to question such a basic law in several ways: if the universe itself is not linear but perhaps curved, the lines would eventually meet. And second, what influence would gravitation play upon these two lines? It was these daring interplays of factors that set Einstein apart and led to his famous speculations about relationships between mass, time, and energy.<br />It is a credit to Holsing that he is able to describe Einstein's mental journeys as lucidly as he does. This is not to say there is no hard work required. Einstein had a hand in nearly all branches of physics, including optics, electricity, and radiation, and he was in constant dialogue with other noted thinkers of his age, including Niels Bohr and Max Planck. For an older reader unfamiliar with quantum physics, the scientific debates over the nature of light may as well be written in Vulcan. Be that as it may, the faithful reader will probably take away enough science to be dazzled and deeply impressed when Einstein's most audacious speculation-that light is bent by gravitational pull-is dramatically proven during a total eclipse of the sun in 1918.<br />For all practical purposes, Einstein's creative career ended around 1920, the same time he began to attract respectable university and lecture fees. The years between 1920 and 1955 are remarkable in their own way: Einstein became one of the world's most recognized celebrities in an era of renewed interest in popular science. Like many celebrities he grumbled about the distractions but rarely missed a good dinner. Universities that hired the grand thinker after 1920 did so at their own risk: Einstein traveled widely and allowed his life to be governed by the Muse of creativity. He spent three decades working unsuccessfully to eliminate mathematical kinks from his general theory of relativity. [Ironically, since 1995 astronomical discoveries of the magnitude of dust and gas in the universe have tended to smooth out the rough edges of the relativity theory.]<br />Although he lived and worked in Germany for manyyears, Einstein carried a deep-seated suspicion of German militarism. He was disillusioned with the conduct of most of his scientific colleagues during World War I, and he was early to see the direction of Nazi policy. Relocating to Princeton, New Jersey, he lived the final two decades of his life in the United States. As Folsing tells it, the United States government kept Einstein at arm's length, perhaps due to a 1930 speech in which he remarked that if as few as 2% of a nation's draftees refused to serve, its military force would crumble. The speech made Einstein an icon among pacifists, and \\"2%\\" buttons became popular leftist items throughout the 1930's. Given Einstein's political leanings, it is one of history's better fortunes that Franklin Roosevelt took seriously Einstein's warnings about German development of a fission bomb. However, Einstein was considered too much of a security risk to be considered for the Manhattan Project and was systematically excluded from any information about the project.<br />Folsing chronicles the struggles of Einstein's two marriages and the somewhat flagrant adulteries of his middle years. Contrary to popular belief, Einstein was in fact a handsome and captivating younger man. It was only in later years that hygiene and fashion tended to deteriorate, perhaps as a statement of sorts to his prim Princeton neighbors. Folsing captures Einstein's wit: once, when the mayor of his town apologized for sewerage fumes from a treatment plant wafting toward the Einstein residence, the good scientist confessed that on occasion he had \\"returned the compliment.\\"y years, Einstein carried a deep-seated suspicion of German militarism.

Hiding a railroad car in Chicago requires a rather large suspension of reader credulity, and fortunately the search for the equipment is not the centerpiece of the book. The more intriguing issue is the whereabouts of its passenger, a relatively new auxiliary bishop known by most of his peers as Idiot Quill. There is no absence of suspects, so what we have here is an inner city Murder on the Orient Express.<br />This untimely disappearance of a prince of the Church causes no little embarrassment for the Cardinal of Chicago with his superiors in Rome. So, as is his wont, the Cardinal turns over  this dirty affair to his fix-it auxiliary bishop, Blackie Ryan. That Ryan is a bishop is itself a mystery: he eschews popery, as they would say years ago, ministers to teenagers [his rectory is full of mouthy girls answering phones and violating confidentiality], and spends considerable time making sick calls-when is the last time your bishop visited you in the hospital?-wearing a Michael Jordan jacket, no less. He is so well connected to every ranking cop, judge, reporter, doctor, and psychiatrist in Chicago that solving crimes for this bishop is more a matter of managing his cell phone than rummaging with the CSI unit.<br />The art of reading Greeley novels used to be deciphering the author's ecclesiology du jour, or what he thought about the American Catholic Church at any given time. There is still some element of that challenge in this work. Here the ugly nemesis is the annulment process-Quill had made a career of mismanaging annulment appeals in Rome-but there are other Greeley signatures as well: spiritual healing through sexual encounter, the failure of priests to visit the sick, whiskey, powerful women professionals, interminable pedigrees of Chicago neighborhoods, and angry feminists come to mind.<br />But age is beginning to tell. Father Greeley, I fear, describes a church life that passed away a generation ago. Blackie's rectory reeks of clerical hospitality, the days when the priests gathered for nightcaps to recount the day's adventures. Today one priest frequently pastors several parishes, and usually alone. In Father Greeley's Chicago the fix is in for the Church: a Roman collar will make a parking ticket magically disappear. No such coziness exists anymore in the present atmosphere; \\"the Meghan\\" [Ryan's teen employees] would all be fingerprinted and subjected to background checks.<br />Greeley's church novels are becoming less mystery and more timepieces. No greater evidence is needed than the heart of the kidnapping plot itself in this book. In the real world of today's Church, the motive would be totally irrelevant.assed away a generation ago.

US	52709329	R1NDA3WXLIHT7C	1587680092	357053021	Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life	Books	5	38	40	N	Y	Francis No Innocent [pun intended]	Adrian House saunters through the life of Francis of Assisi pretty much as I imagine Francis himself traveled the Italian countryside. He is in no particular hurry, he takes time to digest the curiosities of his journey, and on occasion he stops altogether to sing and celebrate what he had discovered. House is deeply respectful of his sources--Thomas of Celano and Bonaventure of the thirteenth century, for example, or Bishop John Moorman of our own day-and he is less skeptical than other biographers of devotional sources like The Little Flowers. He has produced a biography that neither labors under its own gravity nor settles into the bog of ecclesiastical mush.<br />It is House's periodic detours that also distinguish this work. We get a primer of Italian city-state politics, street life in the towns, the idiosyncrasies of bishops and noblemen, and the temper of contemporary church life and piety. We get a very thorough immersion into the appalling poverty that was the routine lot of most grim souls in the thirteenth century. We get descriptions of the papal court on vacation, the atmosphere of a medieval ecumenical council, and the eccentric sumptuousness of the Sultan's war camp. We learn probably more than we want to know about the horrors of the siege of Damietta during the Fifth Crusade. We also enter into the private musings of the author himself who takes time to speculate on such matters as whether Francis had some premonition of the Big Bang Theory.<br />House's Francis is a saint in every sense of the word: a humanitarian of historic proportions whose religious commitment to Gospel and Church almost single-handedly redeemed medieval Catholicism as a holy communion. In retelling an oft-told tale, House succeeds in giving us new ways to look at Francis. He attributes to the saint the same quality that Shelby Foote sees in Abraham Lincoln: the ability to stand outside of himself and understand how he looked and sounded to others. Francis was the master of the symbolic gesture: preaching naked, taming animals, singing and dancing. Spontaneous as he was, Francis knew exactly what he was doing and precisely what he hoped to communicate.<br />Where many biographers find Francis the soul of innocence, House understands that his subject was brilliant. It is no coincidence that Francis cultivated precious relationships with men who could do him much good: Guido, Bishop of Assisi; Innocent III; Cardinal Ugolino/Gregory IX. It was the influence of these men who preserved Francis from the fate of many other like-minded reformers of his time: the brand of heresy. How is it that Francis \\"happens\\" to be in Rome for the Fourth Lateran Council to protect the interests of his new order, or at Damietta to serve as missionary-negotiator on behalf of Christian crusaders with the Sultan?<br />House's interpretation of the \\"later Francis\\" is intriguing. In Chapter 21, \\"The Small Black Hen,\\" Francis chooses discretion over valor. He decides, albeit resignedly, that absolute poverty was not worth the enduring distrust of the Church hierarchy. Perhaps with the idea that he himself would become a marginalized friar free to pursue Gospel absolutes, he decides to let the Church legalize the governance of the now several thousand brothers he had attracted. This change of heart would open the door for permanent friaries, libraries, schools, and a more conventional religious lifestyle. Like many saints, Francis was an autocrat, and his change of heart on the matter of poverty and church authority was a blind side to his feisty co-founder Clare, then engaged in even more intense struggles with the Curia over matters of the rule and financial security.  Clare, in some respects, emerges in the final chapters as the strongest but last of the old true believers. The ultimate loser was Elias, who became the target and scapegoat of disillusioned friars in the years after Francis's death.<br />So who were the enemies of Francis and Clare? House talks aboutthem incessantly [why the need for a \\"Cardinal Protector\\"?] but never says exactly who they are or, more to the point, whether their concerns about the nascent religious movement were justified. We come to find, for example, that civil rulers were none too happy about the proliferation of lay followers of Francis, all of whom as professed pacifists refused to bear arms and thus gave weight to church over state. It is also clear that many of Francis's enemies were members of the Roman Curia. House echoes the conventional wisdom that many churchmen perceived the friars as dangerously loose and unstructured and as unsettling to local clergy. Is it possible, though, that some churchmen of vision saw what Francis and Innocent refused to anticipate: an inevitable divisiveness between idealism and reality?<br />For all of his love for things Franciscan, House does not enter into the tired polemic over the comparative virtues of today's Franciscans vis-&agrave;-vis the contemporary intimates of Francis. One gets the sense from this narrative that Francis's distinctive embrace of poverty was a message to the poor as much as to the rich. Francis, master of the religious gesture, understood that his hyperbolic example of poverty was an affirmation that the poor life of the citizenry was a holy one, not a meaningless one. His observance of poverty was about Incarnation, not subjugation. Were Francis alive today, we can conclude, he might have less to say about personal possessions and everything to say about the human experience.<br /><br />.ut them incessantly [why the need for a \\"Cardinal Protector\\"?] but never says exactly who they are or, more to the point, whether their concerns about the nascent religious movement were justified.

Taft of Ohio was a bastion of the Republican Party. Son of President William Howard Taft and elected to the U.S. Senate in 1938, he was \\"Mr. Republican\\" in that venerable chamber for fifteen years till his untimely death in 1953. Widely respected as a legislative tactician, he developed a fiercely loyal public following. He was a major contender for the Republican nomination for the presidency of the United States in not one but four presidential campaigns: 1940, 1944, 1948, and 1952. In all four contests, however, he was ultimately passed over in favor of the likes of Wendell Willkie, John Bricker, Thomas Dewey, and Dwight Eisenhower. One would like to say that these successive defeats are merely disappointments in an otherwise brilliant career, but in fairness they do raise the question of whether Taft was \\"Mr. Electible Republican.\\"<br />James T. Patterson approached the Taft family in 1968 and became the first biographer to receive full access to the late Senator's archives. This 1972 biography thus enjoys preeminence among the several works about the Ohio Senator. Patterson's intent was a readable biography; he admits in his preface that the sheer amount of documentation [1400 boxes] and the closeness in time to the subject's life [then less than twenty years] made a definitive treatment impossible. All the same, Patterson does not shy away from a treatment of Taft's character and motivations, his place in the American political spectrum, or the painful details of his various presidential campaigns.<br />The fact that no major treatment of Taft's life has appeared in the three decades since this work is an indicator of several things. First, Patterson did in fact achieve a reasonably thorough presentation of the Taft persona. And secondly, Taft's predictability and innate conservatism as portrayed by Patterson have led historians to suspect that there would be few surprises in those 1400 cartons. Patterson is kind to his subject and admires him to a point, but he is compelled to present him as essentially colorless, efficient, predictable, self-assured, opinionated, and inflexible. These are wonderful qualities for a tax lawyer or a Midwestern state legislator, and indeed Taft was both of these over his career. It is fair to say that as Taft's ambition grew, his personality became more of a liability. Patterson does not run from this hard truth.<br />Taft inherited much of his personal philosophy from his father, but the mentor who seems to have energized him toward public service was Herbert Hoover. Young Bob Taft served under Hoover during the latter's extraordinary tenure as emergency relief coordinator in Europe at the close of World War I. His tutelage under Hoover impressed Taft in several ways: he returned home convinced of the importance of American agriculture, the potency of effective business management, and the necessity of disengaging from European politics. He was thus a poster boy for Ohio political life, and Republican bosses such as Cincinnati's Rudolph Hynicka did not object to this suburban Brahmin making his way to Columbus and the state legislature. Ohio-already in the throes of depression in the 1920's--featured bitter political battles between big city and agricultural interests over matters of modernization, public relief, taxation and debt reduction. Taft survived not on charisma but on competence. He literally wore down opponents with floods of statistics until they cried uncle.<br />As a politician seeking higher office, Taft had few \\"laughers\\" along the way, particularly in his U.S. Senate campaigns. Only his 1950 election was won comfortably. Part of the difficulty was the deep electoral split between city and country in Ohio. Another problem was Franklin Roosevelt who, as Patterson observed, caused nearly all Republicans to run on a platform of \\"the TVA is a wonderful thing and we'll see that it never happens again.\\" Taft himself was an energetic albeit wooden campaigner who, like Dewey, probably lost votes on the stump with an awkwardness that was more offensive than loveable. Patterson himself was mystified at the mediocrity of the men who managed Taft's campaigns. While Eisenhower enjoyed the counsels of Herbert Brownell and Sherman Adams, Taft entrusted campaign responsibility to political hacks with whom he felt comfortable. In the final analysis, Taft depended primarily upon his own judgment in the planning of election strategy, and as often as not he was wrong. Nor did he appear to learn much from successive primary failures.<br />As a U.S. Senator Taft established himself as the opposition leader against New Deal philosophy. While his Senate record is impressive-he was co-sponsor of the controversial Taft-Hartley labor legislation, for example-he never quite understood that the anti-Roosevelt vote, as passionate as it was, would not translate into enough party delegate strength to carry a nomination. His opposition within the party was pragmatic as much as doctrinal. Willkie, Dewey, and Eisenhower were nominated, in the final analysis, because they were more attractive candidates. For the consummate party loyalist Taft, this pragmatism was hard to swallow. He blamed East Coast Republicans [read Dewey], internationalists, and the newspapers for promulgating the idea that he was unelectable. The nomination of Eisenhower in particular enraged him and his followers, though even Patterson admits that Taft would probably have failed as a national candidate.<br />Patterson does not shortchange Taft's personal life, though even here one senses a bit of impoverishment. Taft was neither religious nor philanthropic. He was happily married to Martha Bowers until a stroke dramatically altered her personality, leaving her cantankerous and enfeebled. Interestingly, Taft invited the divorcee Darrah Wunder, a veteran party worker, into his home, ostensibly to care for his wife. Mrs. Wunder soon replaced Martha as Taft's only real political confidante and she created for him an oasis of comfort and support during his last crushing defeat at the 1952 Republican Presidential Convention. Always an isolationist at heart, Taft distrusted President Eisenhower's foreign policy as Senate Majority Leader. Perhaps mercifully, Taft's 1953 death to cancer saved him from eventual exile to the fringes of his beloved party.Dewey, probably lost votes on the stump with an awkwardness that was more offensive than loveable.

US	52709329	R9GOO70LH7VV8	0961848626	271494895	Implications for Effective Psychotherapy with African-American Families and Individuals	Books	2	1	1	N	Y	Wanted: An Editor for Genesis Press	I purchased this work at the request of my students who correctly perceived that marriage and family therapists must practice with exquisite cultural sensitivities. I was initially surprised, even shocked, by the limited bibliography on the subject of Black family psychotherapy available to the practitioner from the general book market. Perhaps unfairly, the burden of identifying and researching \\"Black issues\\" has fallen upon the shoulders of the author, Jay Willis, and the small coterie of African American practitioners and researchers.<br />My second shock was the atrocious editing of this book. Actually, I am being kind. There is no editing.  As best I can tell, most of the chapters are texts of addresses given at conventions, with no effort to avoid the maddening repetitions of the author's favorite themes. Not only is the logical progression of the book nearly imperceptible, but there is wholesale deprecation of the English language. One almost admires the chutzpah of this hearty soul who dares present a national publication without having made the acquaintance of Strunk and White. Or Kate Turabian, for that matter. Lest one accuse me of literary exaggeration, I would point out that on page nineteen the author uses three distinctly different styles of source citation. There are a number of readers, I think, who will not get past the writing style, or the ghastly physical appearance of the text which resembles an underground life of Chairman Mao composed on a vintage typewriter. .<br />My third shock was the author's bizarre attempt to reconstruct the pre-Civil War African-American family, an effort that is far too short for the subject and far too long for this book. Some historians like Daniel Boorstin or Paul Johnson can color with broad strokes; Willis's brush is so broad it requires three men to wield it.  Running with shaky research Willis depicts the native African family experience as a virtual Garden of Eden, disrupted by the intrusion of slavers. This theory simply does not ring true in view of the long and painful demographic shifts that we can document from the European and Asian continents. Closer to home, studies of native Americans reveal remarkable diversity and complexity. Willis's sketch of African family life does not do justice to the richness and diversity of his subject.<br />The pity of it all is that Willis does have interesting things to say about the contemporary American racial scene, but his book actually gets into the way of his powerful opinions. He broaches controversial counseling issues with an almost reckless abandon. For example, he asks in so many words if slavery has, in effect, emasculated today's African-American male. He observes that Black women are pulling away from their male counterparts in the new economy and he states baldly that Black women are becoming more vocal with their complaints that there are no Black men worth marrying.  He discusses interracial pairings, distrust of \\"agencies,\\" violence, addiction to risk taking, and poor schools as issues of particular pertinence to African-American counseling experience.<br />Willis is on target when he describes psychotherapy as a Euro-centered experience. It has long been my observation, too, that in African-American communities a troubled family is much more likely to turn to the extended family or the elders of the church than to a professional therapist usually in the employ of \\"the system.\\" Willis spends a lot of words to make the simple case that the therapist in an African-American setting needs to be a good case manager. His theory of counseling, when finally distilled, is a branch of the cognitive restructuring school. This is a richer insight than it seems, because the effects of racism are proportional to the way the victim thinks of himself. Some African-American clients are filled with rage; others manifest remarkable self-esteem and inner freedom. Willis puts great stress upon the therapeutic opportunities of changing self perceptions.<br />Willis bemoans the absence of African-American therapists in the United States, a condition that has not significantly changed in the decade since the book's appearance. [If anyone doubts this assertion, simply hang around a state's mental health licensing exam hall.] Given the fact that most psychotherapists will continue to be white for the foreseeable future, thoughtful analysis of the Black counseling experience is critical, particularly for those of us in the public health sector who engage routinely in transcultural therapy. Willis strikes me as the kind of practitioner who reflects upon what he sees and holds no fear of putting his controversial thoughts on paper. He has experience; he has courage; what he needs is an editor.changing self perceptions.  <br />Willis bemoans the absence of African-American therapists in the United States, a condition that has not significantly changed in the decade since the book's appearance.

US	52709329	R1BCIJTNABMQLX	0806131357	127485853	John Charles Fremont: Character as Destiny	Books	4	10	10	N	Y	Finding the Pathfinder	There were few Americans of the nineteenth century with greater name recognition than John C. Fremont. His five controversial treks across the uncharted Rockies aroused interest and controversy. His military exploits in Mexican California brought him a court-martial. He struck gold in California, became an outspoken abolitionist, and ran as the first Republican candidate for the Presidency of the United States. Married into one of America's most powerful political families, he won and then lost a major command in the Union Army. He habitually cheated investors on several continents out of millions of dollars, only to be bankrupted himself by bigger sharks. There is a great story here.<br />Unfortunately, Andrew Rolle's biography of Fremont is a bit flat, perhaps because of the author's announced intention of probing the psychological motivations behind this life of stupefying behaviors. Rolle states in his preface that he studied psychiatry and psychoanalysis to prepare himself for this work. Most readers will find themselves wishing he had spent more time with cartographers. In a work whose hero is called \\"The Pathfinder,\\" there is not a single map! It is no exaggeration to say that for literally half the book the reader is never certain exactly where the Pathfinder is.<br />It is equally fair to say that despite the author's best efforts, we don't get an unprecedented roadmap of Fremont's inner psychological journeys, either. It is clear from the simple factual narrative that Fremont, like Hamilton, was ashamed of his humble origins, that he was blessed or plagued with wanderlust, that he instinctively rebelled against authority figures, that he was addicted to risk taking and suffered significant deficiencies of empathy and moral character. This personality profile would have emerged easily enough from a straightforward telling of the tale, without the baggage of psychoanalytic spin. Curiously, the psychodynamics of Fremont's marriage to his lover/promoter Jessie Benton, are not addressed. The story of the remarkable Jessie, however, is one of the redeeming features of this work.<br />Since very few readers are likely to be millionaires, there are probably many like me who would like to know how one loses a million dollars. Fremont accomplished this several times, with different commodities, different economies, different schemes, and even different countries. He was a master of losing money imaginatively. Rolle is spotty in his accounts of Fremont's financial empire. The reader is left to surmise that investors were attracted to The Pathfinder's name recognition and that the Fremonts lived beyond their means, but obviously there is much more to this ongoing financial soap opera that can only be guessed at.<br />The good news for the reader is that warts and all, this is still a reasonably captivating biography. Rolle's style is professional and his character compelling. If at times the reader feels as lost as the disastrous Fourth Expedition, the views from the top and the bottom of Fremont's career are still quite spectacular.e Benton, are not addressed.

It is a matter of faith among us that Galileo invented the telescope and consequently a spate of remarkable objects in the heavens, particularly the rings of Saturn. We know he performed wizardlike scientific demonstrations from the leaning Tower of Pisa. If we had the benefit of a good liberal arts education, we came to understand, albeit dimly, that he got in trouble for all this with the Church.<br />Biographer Michael Sharratt did a wise thing. He describes Galileo's adventures with the new telescope in the very first chapter of his biography, because he knows this is what we want to know first. It is a compelling chapter, although there is no way to tell the story without a certain measure of demythologizing. Galileo did not invent the telescope; the instrument was in common use in the Dutch Republic, though our hero certainly improved upon it. He never had a telescope strong enough to identify the rings of Saturn [another Dutchman, Huygens, gets credit for that.] And perhaps most depressing, Galileo first conceived of a telescope as an instrument of naval intelligence and tried to market it as such.<br />Sharratt's book is not for curious little boys, but for the thoughtful grownups they became. The bulk of this book is not about the dramatic discoveries, but the wonder and dismay they precipitated. This work has a certain jargon true to its time. Galileo by trade was a mathematician. As the times did not require the high precision math of the nuclear-computer age, mathematicians, at least the good ones, served society by promulgating what we might call the sciences of organization: logic, the structure of accurate thought, and physics, the predictability of causes and effects.<br />By Galileo's time, the early seventeenth century, traditional logic and physics were under assault by a number of independent scientists whose hypotheses and improved observation methods were bending the old medieval synthesis to the breaking point. Under particular assault were two venerable systems: Ptolemy's concept of the universe in which the sun, planets, and stars circled the earth; the other. Aristotle's complex synthesis of observable matter and motion.<br />Sharratt traces with considerable detail Galileo's early disenchantment with both Ptolemy and Aristotle. Although questioning whether the Tower of Pisa events were quite the spectacle they were reported to be, Sharratt examines Galileo's method of disproving Aristotelian truisms such as the tendency of heavier objects to fall faster than lighter ones. Galileo, like many of his contemporaries, romanced the theories of Copernicus, whose theory of a sun centered universe better explained the retrograde motion of planets as observed from the earth. It was Galileo's eventual marriage to the Copernican system that would cause him so much trouble with the Church.<br />The new telescope in the hands of a Copernican newlywed was an almost dangerous union. Galileo used his early observations virtually exclusively to attempt to prove the validity of the Copernican system [though Keppler, with all his number crunching, did a more thorough job of this.] Galileo's discovery of four moons revolving about Jupiter established at least that the earth was not the center of motion. The crescent face of Venus made a strong case, as he saw it, for a sun-centered universe. Perhaps most damaging to traditionalists, the discovery of mountains and valleys on the moon implied that heavenly objects could, for all practical purposes, undergo the same secular critiques as earthly matter and principles.<br />Sharratt depicts Galileo as a gregarious man with many friends who, like most struggling artisans, knew how to ingratiate himself to influential patrons for financial support and connections. He could be jealously protective of his prerogatives and he did not suffer fools gladly. Sharratt's research leads him to believe that Galileo ran afoul of the Jesuits, or at least some of them, who were only too happy to provide Robert Bellarmine and the Roman Inquisition with disquieting interpretations of Galileo's works.<br />The Inquisition's public dispute with Galileo involved the latter's teaching of Copernicanism. Put simply, adherence to Copernican theory in 1616 was tantamount to a denial of Biblical inerrancy in the eyes of the Catholic Church, then deeply enmeshed in struggles with Protestant reformers over, among other things, Biblical interpretation. However, there can be no doubt that Galileo's dismemberment of the Aristotelian system was viewed as an equally inimical threat to the unity and soundness of Catholic doctrine, also under fire from Protestants. In 1616 a somewhat friendly and informal encounter with Bellarmine and Pope Urban VIII resulted in an avuncular warning that Galileo refrain from public advocacy of Copernicanism. Sharratt reports that there was some confusion over precisely what these men agreed to. Hence, when Galileo published his masterpiece The Dialogue in 1632, in which he enhanced and reinforced earlier writings, he was arrested by the Inquisition for reneging upon the instruction of 1616. Sharratt's description of the trial is terse and brief; Galileo lived his remaining years under house arrest.<br />Somewhat misplaced is the final chapter on Galileo's rehabilitation by John Paul II in 1992. This chapter has the marks of an afterthought or editorial recasting. The author himself admits that the \\"rehabilitation\\" was of the Church, not Galileo. More tellingly, Sharratt makes no mention of present struggles between Church traditionalists and modern day Galileos, and he would have needed to look no further than to reproductive science. One need only consider the present state of Catholic sexual ethics to see that the microscope has replaced the telescope as an object of terror for today's Bellarmines.believe that Galileo ran afoul of the Jesuits, or at least some of them, who were only too happy to provide Robert Bellarmine and the Roman Inquisition with disquieting interpretations of Galileo's works. <br />The Inquisition's public dispute with Galileo involved the latter's teaching of Copernicanism.

US	52709329	R5PU1CY8169GR	0807118583	901433695	The John C. Calhoun and the Price of Union: A Biography (Southern Biography)	Books	4	43	47	N	N	Scarlett O'Hara's Favorite Senator	In his opening remarks John Niven makes the promise that he would not undertake psychoanalysis of John C.Calhoun, Much to his credit, he is true to his word. What Niven has delivered is an eminently readable and straightforward account of South Carolina's greatest political figure. We forget all that he did: senator, secretary of war, secretary of state, and vice president, in a distinguished career that began in the early days of Madison's presidency and concluded during the Taylor-Fillmore administration, a span of nearly four decades.<br />Niven's disclaimer, however, is telling. There is a tendency to use Calhoun's career as a sort of national inkblot. For constitutional scholars and ideologues of many stripes Calhoun's writings survive as either the last great stand of states rights or as a subversive manifesto for the tragic secession that would follow. For politicians and observers of human behavior, Calhoun is either the consummate patriot or his own worst enemy.<br />From the data Niven provides, it can be said that while Calhoun may have been eccentric, he was not crazy. Everyone born in primitive eighteenth century America survived with a history, and Calhoun, born in 1782, was no exception. His family and his colony shared a history of terrible suffering at the hands of the British [those were Calhoun's people slaughtered in Mel Gibson's \\"The Patriot.\\"] Calhoun himself was orphaned as a young teen and appears to have spent a studious but lonely existence until he studied law at Yale under the famous Timothy Dwight.<br />Calhoun arrived home with his diploma just in time to ride a wave of strong Carolina resistance against the Virginia-New York axis that seemed to control presidential elections. This handsome, passionate, articulate favorite son soon found himself elected to Congress where he naturally became a leading advocate of war against the hated British. On June 18, 1812, Calhoun and other hawks got their war, but the thoughtful Calhoun quickly ascertained that the United States was woefully unprepared. Calhoun regretted his impetuousness, and nothing would absolve his guilt for this nasty war.<br />Calhoun would do penance for his sins by serving as Secretary of War under Monroe. Niven commends him for an outstanding tenure during which Calhoun reformed the army's purchasing policies, developed stronger defense outposts in the west, and crafted an almost enlightened Indian policy. An ambitious man, Calhoun not unreasonably expected his War Department success to catapult him toward bigger and better things.<br />But here one of the major themes of the book emerges: Calhoun was an unlucky politician. It was his bad fortune to reach his prime concurrently with an unusually large class of outstanding statesmen: Henry Clay, William Crawford, John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, Andrew Jackson, and Martin Van Buren, to name a few. While he could console himself with the role of \\"everybody's favorite second\\" in the 1824 election, that convoluted contest left him tainted goods in the eyes of many, and an outsider in the Adams cabinet to boot.<br />Calhoun reluctantly threw his lot with Jackson in 1828, but by this date the South Carolinian was having long thoughts about his home region. Cotton prices were low, and protective tariffs seemed to him to exact a crushingly heavy toll from southern growers like himself. And although he shared some of Clay's enthusiasms for internal improvements, most notably transportation systems for the inner reaches of the Carolinas, Calhoun became increasingly suspicious and hostile of the federal government, dubious about its ability and will to protect slavery and Calhoun's idyllic picture of the agricultural southern life. A highly sensitive man, he internalized what he saw as the political treachery of Clay, Van Buren, and especially Crawford, who raised Calhoun-baiting to an art form, for reasons never precisely spelled out.<br />Calhoun began to write prodigiously on the subject of states rights and federal encroachments. As Niven observes, his writings were alternately brilliant and contradictory. Potboiler states rights speeches and pamphlets were common in America as the young nation sorted itself out. But how far could a politician really go on the matter of a state's autonomy? Until the Jackson era there seemed to have been a gentleman's agreement that the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions represented the boundary of political good taste.  Calhoun crossed that line in his defense of nullification, increasingly preoccupied by perceived threats to his beloved South Carolina, In doing so Calhoun lost his national political base and a sense of the national pulse. No longer viable as even a regional candidate for the presidency, he assisted President Tyler by his skillful negotiating with Great Britain on the Oregon border question. But he objected to the Mexican War, not on humanitarian grounds but because he feared the socioeconomic consequences of the acquisition of Mexican territory, i.e., new free soil states. He was correct in his assessment that the consequences of the Mexican War would bring political turmoil to the United States. He had few horses to trade on the floor of congress as the Wilmot Proviso was debated, but his style till the end was magnificent.<br />From Niven's account it is fair to say that Calhoun was never a universally recognized spokesman for the South during his own lifetime. The Richmond Junto despised him. Unionists were still a majority in the South at the time of his death in 1850. Moderate southern businessmen even in his home state found his philosophy antiquated and at times deleterious to their state's economy. Many found him unbearably pedantic. Only later, as the nation polarized, would his political philosophy become a revered creed for those who dared to think the unthinkable.<br />Niven's work is a fine presentation for the casual reader and a more than adequate primer for those eager to delve into the mind and works of the consummate antebellum apostle of states' rights.ct of states rights and federal encroachments.

It is a hard time to be a compassionate, intellectually disciplined, forward looking Catholic. The papacy of John Paul II has grown increasingly humorless, pessimistic, autocratic, and fideistic over the years. In recent weeks alone the Vatican declaration on the supremacy of the Catholic Church, coupled with the trial balloons involving canonizations of the Piuses IX and XII, have caused thoughtful Catholics to wince in embarrassment.<br />Reformers in the Church need a rallying point. As it becomes more politically dangerous for career pastors and theologians to lead such a renewal, the task may very well fall to a new breed of Catholic thinker, the lay philosopher-theologian beyond the pale of ecclesiastical harassment or sanction. Gary Wills is certainly such a candidate. His passion, his research, his breadth of insight, and his religious faith are beyond question.<br />But Papal Sin? A provocative title, to be sure. Too many Catholic reformers over the past half-century have discredited themselves from the starting block by letting their angers gestate whining diatribes that, for all their erudition, sound like the ranting of petulant teenagers. Papal Sin teeters on the edge. This is an angry work which portrays the popes of the past two centuries as constitutionally incapable of leading the Body of Christ with beatific purity of heart. For Wills the papacy has consumed its best energies in a titanic effort to preserve its own past, heaping generations of misrepresentation, disingenuous readings of Scripture and history, and outright lying.<br />A scathing indictment, yes. But his arguments are, at the very least, salient. The first section of Papal Sin is devoted entirely to Catholic relations with the Jews. The timing of this could not be more fortuitous, given the recent Vatican declarations on world religions and the recent appearance of a spate of books defending Pius XII. [One might include here the nomination of Joseph Lieberman as the Democratic candidate for the vice-presidency, for that matter.]  Wills avoids getting snagged into the tedious arguments of what Pius XII did or did not do during World War II. Rather, he traces the behaviors of the popes toward Jews through Pius IX, citing among other examples Pius IX's \\"kidnapping\\" of Edgardo Mortara through John Paul's motivations for the canonization of Edith Stein. Pius XII's behaviors are examined in this fuller historical context. Wills divines a cultivated attitude of Catholic hegemony in its behavior toward the Jews, as when he views the canonization of Stein as a papal effort to hijack the Holocaust from the Jews and establish a cult of Nazi persecution of Catholics.<br />Much of this work, however, is an in-house examination of the papacy's management of birth control, priestly celibacy, the shrinking numbers of ordained ministers, annulments, priestly pedophelia, homosexual priests, excesses of Marian dogma and devotion, abortion, and infallibility. In nearly all of these chapters Wills draws attention to the discrepancies between papal practice and the evidence of Scripture and history. His research is provocative and colorful, but there is little new ground broken here. Intellectual Catholics have lived with this discrepancy for centuries. What is distinctive is the author's bluntness in charging that the recent popes have been guilty, at the very least, of culpable ignorance, and in some cases, worse. John Paul II in particular, perhaps the most gifted thinker of the past two centuries, appears to be singled out as the pope who really should have known better.<br />Not for three hundred pages do we find the spiritual soul of this book. While John Henry Newman gets honorable mention, not surprisingly it is Wills' hero, Augustine, against whom modern popes pale. Papal Sin describes Augustine's ten year battle with Jerome for intellectual honesty in interpreting the Bible, and his straightforward handling of a case of mishandling of funds entrusted to his stewardship in his own diocese. There is in this section an almost desperate desire on the part of the author for a pure and dependable teaching authority, a hint of Luther's passionate search for bedrock of confident faith. The Newman-Augustine treatments put into context Wills' sense of outrage at the pragmatic modus operandi of the Vatican bureaucracy.<br />There are theological flaws here. Wills venerates honesty as something of a beatitude, forgetting that in theory and practice the Church has approached the beatitudes as ideals, not institutional operational principles. He appears to have difficulty with another of Augustine's teachings, that of pervasive original sin. [Jesus' dictum that his disciples be wise as serpents would not cut the mustard in this book.]  Wills complains that standard Vatican language carries the message it is above the Church, not part of it. But if the papacy is indeed of the common clay of the church militant, then it should come as no surprise that popes share the sinfulness and duplicity of its members. Wills shows great sympathy for the \\"victims\\" of papal dishonesty, particularly loyal parish priests. But would not modern psychology have something to say about those who choose to live in chronic victimhood? Nor does Wills put forward anything resembling a self-reforming model of church leadership. [As a graduate student, I asked my canon law professor how a more democratic might look. \\"Like the 1972 Democratic Convention,\\" he quipped.]<br />Papal Sin is not a banner for discouraged Catholics. It is the sincere outcry of a Catholic layman who wants better example from those who would lead his communion of faith. It is not an unreasonable request.o his stewardship in his own diocese.

Nichols' work dates back to 1931, an era of different writing styles and certainly different interpretations of  American political life.<br />When I refer to this work as a  &quot;Plodder,&quot; I intend no disrespect. Nichols work is, for the most  part, a straightforward biography of a New Hampshire politician who became  an unlikely compromise candidate for the presidency in 1852. To borrow a  sports analogy, one has to be in a position to win in order to win, and the  author painstakingly traces the steps of this methodical politician that  put him in lightning's way.<br />Nichols leaves the reader with ample evidence  to believe that Franklin Pierce owed at least something of his steady rise  through local offices to the reputation of his father, General Benjamin  Pierce, a Revolutionary war hero and governor of New Hampshire in his own  right. Franklin graduated from Bowdoin and began his lawn practice  precisely at the heydey of his father's own success. A late twentieth  century biographer most certainly would have delved into the psychodynamics  between father and son.<br />In the style of the day, Nichols hints at, but  does not detail, several critical factors in Pierce's life. His marriage to  Jane Appleton smacks of Lincoln's trials with Mary Todd. His drinking was  problematic. His absence of commitment to one of the proper religious  denominations of the day was noted then by those who charted such things.  He seemed to have been unduly shaken early in his congressional career when  John Calhoun denounced him on the floor over a ludicruously insignificant  matter. Later The reader is left to surmise the impact of a horrific family  tragedy upon Pierce's state of mind as he prepared to take the presidential  oath in 1853.<br />Nichols' Pierce was himself a plodder who for the most  part achieved political offices the old fashioned way: he earned it, and  particularly by his services within the Democratic Party. Pierce enforced  party discipline with a ruthlessness that served him well early in his  career, but his intractibility was a serious handicap in the 1850's as  America saw multiple realignments of political families. Nichols recounts  the presidential years in straightforward fashion, but he deftly questions  the wisdom of trying to build national unity through a  &quot;representative&quot; cabinet of such diverse characters as Jefferson  Davis and William Marcy. The upshot of such a strategy was a not unexpected  rearguard action from within the executive branch that stymied the few  genuine executive initiatives from the presidential desk.<br />Much to his  credit, Nichols reminds his readers that the Pierce Presidency was more  than Bleeding Kansas. In fact, one is left with the impression that Pierce  never had the full picture of the Kansas situation. The years 1853-1857  were times of Indian wars in the northwest, railroad dealings and wheelings  north and south, filibustering in central America, the emergence of the  Know-Nothings, and a variety of midrange diplomatic problems with England  and Spain in particular. Some of Pierce's diplomats--Pierre Soule and Dan  Sickles, for example--did not represent him well. There is surprisingly  little information about reaction to the Fugitive Slave Law; Pierce never  waivered in his belief that the growing vocal reaction against slavery was  nothing more than the annoyance of a few malcontents, an impression formed  in New Hampshire in the 1830's when Pierce was laboring to build party  unity.<br />The absence of a psychological vocabulary hinders Nichols when he  attempts to describe the dissolution of Pierce after his presidency. As the  Civil War unfolds, Pierce's inability to either understand its forces or  accept the new national order becomes eery. In the structured world of  Franklin Pierce, the abolitionists are the villains, true anarchists, andtheir sin is disruption of the Democratic Party. The moral component of  both &quot;causes,&quot; north and south, totally escaped him...their sin is disruption of the Democratic Party.
