I thought Destiny Unleashed was a bit boring and not as adventurous as Sherryl Woods' other novels. <br /> <br />Her other books had a sense of mystery and suspense.  Destiny Unleashed was too romantic and no adventure. <br /> <br />It was a quick read, but I couldn't wait to finish it. <br />	2004-09-17

The characters are all well thought-out and you can actually see them as if they are right there in front of you.  Marne Davis Kellogg is a wonderful writer that puts you right in England, French Riviera and the rest of the wonderful places that Kick Kerwick visits.  Even the food and wine she descibes makes you hungry and thirsty.  This book is a great, fast read and I couldn't put the book down...a great summer read laying by the pool.

I have friends that are in law enforcement and I can see them with some reporter tagging along behind them.  I can definately relate to this book and the storyline.  Right from the get-go the book moved right along and described the caracters right down to a tee.  Like all books, you know who is going to end up with each other and I was so anxious to finish the book and find out what happened to Robin.  I thoroughly enjoyed Sarah Mason's first novel and will be looking for her next one!	2004-07-29

It had no plot and alot of rambling of the male mind.  Men should stick to writing about sports, not love and romance.  There were a few funny parts, but manly the women in the book were bashing men.	2004-07-09

Jennifer Crusie nailed it on the head with this one!  I just loved the way that Phineas and Sophie had an eye on each other and made each other crazy.

I have started to use coconut oil and it definately gives me energy and my mind stays focused all day.  This book nails that &quot;Fat-Free Foods&quot; are no good.  Personal experience dictates this to me.  My Father and Mother eat &quot;fat-free&quot; and their weight bounces up and down almost all the time.  I really believe that &quot;fat-free&quot; foods are no good and have alot of chemical additives.  My Grandmother was 92 when she died and she grew up on a farm, eating lard and bacon grease and no &quot;fat-free&quot; foods her entire life. She just died of old age and never overweight.  This book is a great eye-opener!!	2004-03-23

The problem is, it's not friendly for people who work 12 hours a day.  All the meals need an oven.  I work 70 hours a week, there is no way that the meals would fit into my schedule, unless I eat at 11:00 at night!  The recipes look delicious and I'll try them, but this diet is not for workaholics.	2004-01-13

I felt sorry for Caroline because of all the tragedies and heartbreak that she has gone through though.  One thing that made me dislike the book was the fact that at the opening of the \\"Jacqueline Kennedy: The Camelot Years\\" reception, she snubbed off Laura Bush (The First Lady) and didn't even speak to her, but put Hillary Clinton on the pedestal and praised her.  That seemed pretty rude since through the whole book everyone talked about how down-to-earth and friendly Caroline was.  Overall, the book was just a repeat of everything we pretty much know about the Kennedy's.	2003-11-07

It had romance and some humor, but it was too serious with the talk of suicide.  After a long day, you want a book you could slip away into and imagine you are there.  After reading the first few chapters I wanted to cry.  I liked her other books much better and hope she stays light-hearted in the future.  Book was very well written though.	2003-11-07

I learned about several stars that I never really paid attention to.  It is a quick read and was nice to have different chapters about different stars and to learn about more than one star in a book.  <br />It's amazing how much Hollywood hasn't changed over the years....affairs, drinking, drugs, sex and temper tantrums.  Just that none of it was public knowledge like today is.<br />After reading the book, I went out and bught several old movies just to re-live their works.	2003-11-07

Characters have a life and personality that fits into our &quot;normal&quot; everyday lives that you can connect to.  Wish there was a sequel book because I would like to know what happens to each character and their futures.	2002-09-10

Problem is, the color numbers she uses are no longer in production.  Benjamin Moore, Pratt and Lambert and Pittsburgh paints have changed their colors and cordinating number for you to use.  You must judge the color and find a sample that closely reproduces the color.  Needs to be updated with the new colors and numbers then I would highly recommend it.	2002-05-01
