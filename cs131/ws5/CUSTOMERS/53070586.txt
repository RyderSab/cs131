The 'stew' is reduced and through this reductionist process it becomes rich and sprawling.  There is a teasing reductionism to this tale of how 7 people view events surrounding a kidnapping.  How these 7 tale-tellers are connected and their multifaceted interactions as ethnographers and viewers makes the story more intriguing.  I had a bit of a problem with the 7th 'interpretor'.  So what!  I'm a reader and I can say anything.  Mr. Perlman can write, and can he ever do so!	2005-05-14

That I read the book is the substantive thing.  It knocked my socks off - not as smelly as Winslow's but they still could benefit from a good washing.  The 'lump' stays with me.  The bursting heart, the beating life, the unknown that comprises the solopsistic circle.  It's ok that it's solipsistic.  I'm way past my school days.  Thank you Mr. Canty.  Thank you very much.  By the way,  Missoula reminds me of Fairbanks, my home town.  I wonder if Montana and Alaska both attract the end-of the-roaders or if we're all traveling the same road one time or another.  We're all bound to hit the end some time.  Hey, it this is autobiographical, try cutting down on the booze. You're too good a writer to kill yourself on that poison.	2005-05-14

The writing is reminiscent of Stegner in style.  However, what promises and is close to portending a great story, reneges on the reader.  The plot never forms and vignettes, written with great care and richness, meander to the point of tangentiality.  The characters beckon initially but the reader ends up holding only an ephemeral sense of who the story is about.  There is technique and fineness of description, but the plot is lost and the characters suffer in the author's attempt to give them solidity.  What we have is something but we're never sure what the 'something' is.  There is a sensibility - of time and place - Chicago, the McCarthy era brewing amid the fear of unions and communism, debuttante parties, the newsroom sensationalism, the 'slumming' of the college student in the summer as he mixes with journalists and jazz afficionados.  The environment is painted vividly but the pictures merely overlap without blending.  We have snapshots and an outline.  What we lack is the final story, the blending of ideas leading to a fruition of plot and character development.  I read the book for the beauty of the language, all the while lamenting the lack of solid story and depth of plot.  So much was possible and so little was produced.   It is a shame to see so much promise and receive so little in the end.	2005-01-23

I am not a writer,  I am a reader.  When I find a book as grand as 'American Pastoral', I am truly grateful.  Having come of age in the sixties I can appreciate the right on characterizations, cultural milieu, and the east coast at that time. I'm not from Newark but I am from Queens and somehow they're very connected in my mind.   I hadn't read Mr. Roth's books in decades and I thought of him as 'the guy who wrote Portnoy's Complaint'.  Yes, he is that guy but he has matured in his writing just as his characters have grown, wizened and given life to themselves.  Both Zuckerman and Roth have experienced more over the years.  Life is like that.  A good book is a true find for me.  This is a good book and a great read.	2004-02-19

A big brassy book about a big brassy man.  Roth explores the insidious horror of the McCarthy era without flinching.  He also has no problem discussing the shallowness of the idealogies of the time, whether right or left.  In this book, many of the characters are caught up in the winds of an era rather that thinking for themselves or examining 'truth'.  Isn't this the way in most eras?  Sometimes I wasn't sure whether to laugh or take Mr. Roth's words as intense and literal.  That's part of the joy of the read.  The reader can be as irreverant as he, or not.	2004-02-19

As a clinical social worker and cancer survivor,  I've read many books for my own interest and to screen prior to recommending them to my clients.  This book found its way to me through a client, via her physician.  It resonated with heart and all the pain, joy and multitude of emotions in-between that real heart-experienced life encounters.  It is very personal while also accessible to anyone who likes good literature, is interested in the subject, or has a personal experience with cancer.  I am not a writer but I l love to read.

The book centers on a leading academic, Coleman Silk, who is teaching an English seminar.  For much of the semester, two students haven't attended the class and Professor Silk innocently asks if the students are real or are they spooks.  The students happen to be black and Professor Silk is harrassed to the point of quitting his job because of the derogatory meaning that 'spooks' has for black Americans.  It just so happens, however, the Professor Silk is himself a black man who has spent his life living as a white man.  The mediocrity and acrimony of academia is brilliantly protrayed, along with the misbegotten searching in one's life.  This book also provides one of the most accurate and compelling descriptions of post-traumatic stress syndrome that I have ever read. The hideously hateful  Delphine Roux is the classic professor with power in today's academic institutions.	2003-12-22

Mr. Krakauer looks at the aspects of mormonism that promote fundamental sects to spawn, each with their own cult following.  He looks at the elements that converged to cause the Colorado City murder of a mother and infant, and also the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart.  His reports of the self-contained offshoot mormon communities is like a nightmare with incest, abuse, and control being the mainstream.  I think this was a courageous book to write.

By exploring the lives of Guy Waterman and his family, this book provides a very insightful analysis of the family's  history  and relationships.  The book shows a keen understanding of the psychology of mountaineers and those who love the frontier and outdoors.  It examines the connection of life and death,  the connection of hope with despair and the internal conflicts of one man that eventually led to his taking his own life.  <br />What is special about Mr. Brown's biography of Guy Waterman, is that he refuses to paint a picture of pathology.  Instead he describes Mr. Waterman as unique and grand in all his eccentricities and human frailties.  Here is a man who is connected to wilderness in a spiritual way yet remains existentially alone and unable to connect with his own children in an enduring way.<br />This book is a page-turner, a psychological and philosophical thriller that had me mesmerized from beginning to end.<br />I found Mr. Brown's grasp of Alaskan wilderness accurate.  He knows Denali and the Ruth Glacier in a personal way.   He respects the power of wilderness without impressing his ego on it.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves memoirs, wilderness and psychological mystery.	2003-11-14

The author is right-on with her belief that what constitutes frontier is unique and personal for each of us.  We all have our frontiers and it takes courage, determination and risk for us to test these 'frontier' boundaries, to go beyond our usual comfort level in order to attain our dreams.  It just so happens that Alaska IS a frontier and it attracts many people with a 'frontier state of mind'.  That's what makes the people and diversity of our state so wonderfully unique.  However, even if you live in a city or suburb you can have your own frontiers - the challenge is being able to identify what this frontier is and how to go for it.<br />Judith Kleinfeld does an amazingly insightful job while also creating a very readable and enjoyable book, accessible to anyone who has ever wondered,' What can I do to stretch my limits or go for my dreams'?<br />Frontiers are like Kierkegard's 'leap of faith'.  What most of us don't realize is that we can take that leap and end up on our feet with our lives the better for this risk.  This book looks at a new frontier of ideas.  Thank you Dr. Kleinfeld.	2003-11-09

His books also present the theme of what irrevocable damage can be done by a particular deed or behavior.  His technique of telegraphing inward, working from the future to the present is very interesting as a literary technique.  I enjoy his novels immensely.

Rather, it is a self-serving piece of work by a gallery director to promote sales in her gallery. If you want to pay [$$$] for a 'Vanity Press' book, this is it. However, it in no way represents real and important art in Alaska.	2002-08-06

I appreciate the way he portrays his characters, giving them enough substance and individuality for us to 'know' them, but also permitting us the opportunity to fill in the blanks, to arrive at our own interpretations of just who they are in depth.  It is a modern day fable.  Mr. Martin realizes that fables are rarely truthful and he presents the dark side of the 'knight in shining armor' story.  His presentation of depression as an aspect of Mirabelle's persona is very accurate.  He appears to have a real understanding of the disease.  So.....a lovely read, poignant, tragic and understated.	2002-05-16

My expectations weren't high but I'd read enough Judy Blume previously to know she has the capability of writing a good novel.  This is not a good novel.  The characters are so shallow that they're merely shadows, ideas of what characteristics a Barbie doll might have.  There is 'rich girl with no conscience Barbie', 'smart, poor girl with no personality Barbie', 'Countess Barbie with a drinking problem and an upper class accent', ad nauseum.

However, it is alarming and disturbing. No parent of an adolescent can hope to glean any meaningful direction from this book.  Ms.  Digges philosophically 'interprets' her son's antisocial acting out, excuses (yes I mean excuses) his violence, gun-toting gang persona and never deals with consequences in any rational way.  If he did turn out as well as she says (which I doubt) it is not because of her non-intervention or 'fairness'.  I hope no innocents were killed along the way. This book is fantasy and chance, as unworldly as a Las Vegas show.	2002-03-02

There is no gentleness here. Yet, there is a poignant yearning for what could have been, the 'what if' world. The author is able to convey the way abuse takes over one's core, provides the center to being and compels us to relive it throughout our lives. We rewrite our narrative with each subsequent relationship for reality is internalized and needs to be validated so that one can feel. A truly remarkable book. Not for the faint of heart.	2002-02-02

I was especially enthralled by the author's attempt to 'read her body like a novel', to understand herself from beginning to end, from inside to out, and then back again.  She explores the impact of environment, genetics and family dynamics on self.  She shows the classic outcome of shame, secrecy and silence as they collude to prevent one from learning about their history in context to their familily of origin, over time, and in relationship to the environment.  This is truly a new genre by a writer who is gifted in insight and narrative and has great courage in exploring herself and sharing her insight with the reader.  Thank you, Ms. Antonetta	2001-10-28

It was fun to read and the characterizations were good.  What disappointed me was that some events occurred without explanation and were just 'dropped' when further development seemed essential to the development of the story.  Specifically, I wanted to know more about the end of Keller's relationship and what impact the loss of his girl and his dog had on him.  I also did not get a full understanding of 'the old man' and what was ailing him.  These things will not prevent me from reading Hit list.	2001-10-28
