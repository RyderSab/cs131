I have read most of Dean Koontz's books and really enjoy him when he doesn't get too dark or \\"weird\\".  This book was neither (unless your squeamish about serial killers, in which case you shouldn't be reading horror anyway ;o) and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />The Cop/Buddy aspect was fun and the monsters kept it interesting.  If you are looking for a good horror read, definitely pick this book up!	2005-02-11

From Chris Snow, who could not go out in daylight, to the talking dog in &quot;Watchers&quot;, Mr. Koontz really gets into the minds of his characters.<br />I was hooked on this book from the first page and read it all in a day.  If you like horror, suspense and mystery type books, I think you'll really enjoy &quot;Odd Thomas&quot;.  Highly recommended.	2004-02-09

Melis Nemid lives on her own island in the Carribean w/no one but her dolphins for companionship. She's supported by her &quot;foster father&quot; a wealthy treasure hunter named Phil Lontana.  She had a tough childhood, sexual abuse being involved, so she has a problem trusting people.  When her foster father dies in a boat explosion, Melis teams up w/filthy rich (where does this girl find all these rich dudes?) ex-Navy Seal Jed Kelby to find his murderer. Jed wants Melis to help him find the mythical city of Marinth.  Bad guy Hugh Archer wants to possess Melis and beat Kelby to finding the mythical city. And he has no qualms about hurting people to do so. So the chase is on...<br /><br />Melis's horrific childhood reviewed pretty vividly and in some detail.  I know child sex abuse happens, but I really don't need to hear the nitty gritty details, thanks so much.  That turned me off from the whole story.  And as some other reviewers have pointed out, the bad guys are really, really, bad and the good guys are ever so good.<br />I've read most of Ms. Johansen's books and liked most of them.  If you are new to her books, I'd recommend starting w/one like &quot;And Then You Die&quot; or &quot;Long After Midnite&quot;. This book is by no means terrible, but it was not one of her best, in my opinion, too dark.	2003-10-05

However, from the very beginning this book was a real letdown.<br />The two lead characters were total losers, the male, Dr. Daniel Lowell was a self described &quot;egotistical jerk&quot; and his main squeeze, a 20 year younger &quot;raven-haired beauty&quot; wasn't much more sympathetic. As a reader, if I can't sympathize and identify w/the main characters, or even like them, why do I care about what happens to them?  And in this book, I didn't. Made for some pretty dull reading as you can imagine.<br />I struggled thru the entire book, hoping all the way that it would get better, but it doesn't.  Won't spoil the ending for you, but it wasn't worth the read.<br />If you want to check out Dr. Cook, try some of his older novels like Coma or Sphinx.  At least in those you can stomach the main participants.	2003-09-22

Having enjoyed The Cabinet of the Curiosities, the previous Pendergast novel, I was happy to see him back at work.  Well on vacation actually, but thankfully his idea of fun is tracking down a serial killer who is terrifying the folks of a small Kansas farming town.<br />The supporting cast is excellent,the townfolk well written, especially Pendergast's assistant, town misfit Corrie Swanson.  And I'm w/the reviewers who were not disappointed by the ending, it was actually a better resolution than I'd feared.<br />If you enjoy suspense and thriller novels this is not one to miss. I'd recommend you read the &quot;Cabinet&quot; first to get the full background on Pendergast and his mysterious powers.<br />I hope to see Pendergast again in a future novel by the talented team of Child and Preston.	2003-08-13

The can't shoot straight game warden and his family met up with some interesting characters and great mysteries. But this is NOT a fun read. Joe has gone from being a goofy, all too human guy to being almost a vigilante in just three novels.<br />It held my interest, don't get me wrong, but I read to be entertained and when I finished reading I thought \\"well that was no fun\\".  Too grim and dark, with the bad guys being almost cartoonishly bad. No one(including me!) seemed to be having a very good time in this book.<br />I hope for the next Pickett novel, CJ Box picks up the mood a bit and gets Joe back into his \\"goofy good guy\\" persona. There are enough \\"tortured hero\\" characters out there, Joe Pickett doesn't need to become one of them. I want the old Joe back.	2003-06-19

Usually the arrival of a baby is the kiss of death for a great character.  Here, thankfully, \\"the new kid\\" is consigned to the care of the housekeeper/baby nurse and isn't mentioned in any more than a handful of sentences in the entire book.<br />So w/the baby so well taken care of, Lucas is free to head up to the Northern part of the state to investigate the lynching murders of a biracial couple.  In this small town Lucas soon discovers more murder, drug running nuns, a car theft/chop shop ring, arson, attempted murders and a serial kidnapping/killing ring. Enough to keep him and Del busy for a while anyway.  AND most important, enough crime to keep the reader hooked.<br />John Sandford is one of the few authors I still will buy in hardback.  Catching up w/Lucas, Weather, and the rest of the gang is like seeing old friends again.<br />Naked Prey doesn't disappoint.	2003-06-09

I caught the author on a TV show and was immediately attracted to this book, it's mix of history and celebrity. It makes for \\"hard to put down\\" reading, at least in the first three quarters of the book.<br />As a parent, it broke my heart to see so many first families lose so many of their children. And from what we consider today to be minor illnesses, croup, scarlet fever(strep), an infected cut, tetanus, things modern medicine can cure w/a single innoculation or pill. Lines like \\"they lost three sons before they celebrated their second birthdays\\" made me thankful that for all our problems, I live now rather than in the 1800's.<br />The earlier first families are very interesting, amusing gossip and tons of philanderers, drunks, and ner' do wells in every family make for fun reading. It's when I hit the more modern President's kids that I thought the book ran out of steam. I looked forward to the \\"dirt\\" on the kids I recall, the Carters, the Fords, the Nixons. But alot of their profiles could have been (and probably were) written by their own press secretaries. Not a ner'do well or philanderer in the bunch, or so you'd be lead to believe, despite some of the Carter boys multiple marriages. Made for DRY reading, \\"today she is devoted wife and mother who works w/many charities\\". S-N-O-R-E.<br />Despite it's rather dry last quarter, I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history.	2003-04-11

Elm Haven hasn't aged so well either.<br />I hate it when alot of stuff that happens is not explained at the end, think it's an easy way out for the author.

What do Vikings, Captain Nemo, time travel, and the worlds most modern cruise ship have in common?  Nothing you'd think, but Clive Cussler manages to spin a tale that combines all three in Valhalla Rising.<br />As a long time reader of the Dirk Pitt novels, I find picking up one of these books is like visiting with an old friend.  Fun to &quot;catch up&quot; on their latest adventures. This story is full of typical Pitt stuff, scantily clad ladies, lots of fisticuffs, bullets, badguys, and missles flying, never a dull moment.<br />While alot of reviewers have commented on how unbelievable some of the story is, you always have to remember it IS fiction and just go with it.

Having read the entire series (if you are just starting, try to read them in order as they refer back alot) and enjoyed it, I found this one fun, if a bit predictable.<br />The plot was fast moving, the old friends fun to see, the new people interesting.  I didn't like the fact that you know who the murderer is from the first page though.  I rather liked the guessing involved in previous books like &quot;Winter Prey&quot; when I'm thinking &quot;oh must be him&quot; and then &quot;no maybe it's him&quot;. It's not terrible, just not as much fun in my opinion to know &quot;whodunit&quot; from the get-go.<br />Being a mom of three though, I think the &quot;baby&quot; idea is a bad one.

Even the &quot;why&quot; part was a bit shaky.  But the &quot;romance&quot; element was basically non-existant and pretty lame.

Hard to care about a heroine you don't really like.<br />But I stuck with it and finally got into the interesting mystery. The book moved along at a fast pace and the other characters were likeable and interesting.<br />I DID guess who did it about 3/4 of the way thru, but found the &quot;twist&quot; at the end a bit contrived.

I have read most of Ms. Coulters other  books as well and enjoyed most of them.<br />The the start of the story, the  heroine, Becca, is being stalked by a phone stalker.  She notifies the  police and they tap her phone.  Of course, the stalker never calls then and  the police write her off as an attention grabbing nut.  The minute they  cancel the tap, the calls resume.  Becca apparently has never heard of tape  recorders to record this guys calls &amp; prove to the police she is being  stalked, I guess.  THAT bugged me from the beginning.<br />Sherlock and  Savich are back with their new sidekick Sean and the brightest part of the  story.  Always good to see them.  Everyone else is pretty much &quot;by the  formula&quot; and turns out to be EXACTLY what you think they are.  Dull,  dull reading that makes.<br />Not a terrible book, but could have been alot  better.  If this is your first book by Ms. Coulter, read The Maze first.	2000-08-02

However I didn't really enjoy this book as much as some of his others.<br />Why not?  I'm reading parts thinking &quot;WHAT is going on  here&quot; (only to have those questions answered 3/4 of the way thru the  book).  Hate that, not having a clue what's going on.<br />Also didn't find  Ellen/Yelena particularly sympathetic or even very interesting. That makes  it very hard to even care what happens to her.  The &quot;hero&quot; Pete  Golding is a bit more detailed and alot more interesting.  He saved the  book from 1 star as far as I was concerned.<br />Some of the other  reviewers commented on the skating information not being correct. There was  so little in this book about skating that she could have been a rock star  or actress or anything in the entertainment field for that matter.  So for  the average reader, I don't think that is a real problem.<br />An OK  thriller, not great, not horrible.	2000-06-22

I mean a quadriplegic, blind, mute detective?  How depressing is that? And I know there are people in that unfortunate circumstance in the world, but I read  to relax, not get depressed.<br />But I greatly enjoyed Elise's humor and  thought process.  I really found the book interesting and worth reading,  until the last chapter.<br />At that point I was thinking &quot;oh come  on!&quot; and &quot;yeah like THAT would happen&quot; which to me is a sign  that the ending is NOT what it could be.<br />Up until that point, it's a  great read, so you decide.	2000-06-21

Five star reading.  From there it gets a bit draggy and I felt like giving her a dope slap and saying &quot;Honey, get a SPINE will  ya?&quot;  As she mopes, moans and worries about her hubbies mood swings  and strange behavior.  Of course, she never bothers to bring it up and talk  to him about it.  That was annoying.<br />BUT I didn't guess who and why at  the end, always the sign of a good thriller.  Well worth a read,  if you  like thrillers.	2000-06-10

That said, I would have enjoyed this book alot more had I remotely liked or cared about the person murdered. A supermodel gets murdered after her latest three way  sex romp.  Her drug dealer gets off'd too.  Who cares, ho hum.<br />That made  it hard for me to get into the mystery. In the other Prey Books, the murder  victims were easier to identify with and thus care about who killed them  and why.<br />Lucas and his &quot;gang&quot; are fun and interesting as usual.  I did find Lucas's choice of girlfriends in this book a bit trashy (as one  other reviewer has pointed out no one in Fiction Land seems to worry about  AIDS).  There too, he's done better.<br />Worth a read if you have enjoyed the  rest of the series.  If you haven't started the series, go back and start  at the beginning and try to read them in order.  They all refer back to  stuff that has happened in previous books and this one is no exception.  Besides, those early ones will &quot;hook&quot; you alot faster than this  one.	2000-06-02

Clinical psychologist Alan Gregory and his wife Lauren Crowder are asked to join a select group of law enforcement officials whose specialty is Cold Cases or old unsolved murders.  The murder they are called in on is one  involving two young girls who vanished and were found dead months later.  One of the girls family requests the groups help in solving the  case.<br />This book starts off great and then slows down considerably.  I  really like the main characters, Alan and Lauren.  The rest of the group  was interesting as well.  I just wish the ending wasn't so predictable and  had given these interesting people a more plausable way out!	2000-05-26

This books begins with an unemployed actress who gets pregnant with her unemployed actor boyfriend.  She decides to put her baby up for adoption after she moves home and splits up with her boyfriend.  A married couple  who lost their first child to SIDS adopts the baby.  Two years later,  circumstances change and the acting couple has reunited and hit it big.  They decide they want their baby back and take legal steps to do so.<br />As  we all know, this book was taken out of the headlines in the newspapers.  The author was smart and careful NOT to try to sway your sympathy too much  one way or another.  He didn't demonize either party but presented their  side of the argument as fairly as he could.  I really liked that.<br />This  book appealed to me as a mother, how would I feel in either situation.  Can't say much about the ending (HATE it when people give it away) but I  really enjoyed the book.  Hope you will too.	2000-05-26

A couple of times I  found myself thinking &quot;come on&quot; which is why I gave the book 4  stars instead of 5. But the story really grabs you and drags you along with  it.

While the biotechnology industry, industrial espionage and the human organ transplant field are perfect fodder for a thriller, I didn't feel this book lived up to it's possibilities.<br />First off, the heroine gets hired as THE corporate lawyer by a huge biotech firm.  She lies on her resume about her  background and experience.  And NO ONE bothers to check her background and  references? Yeah right.<br />If you can get past that, the book then becomes  a pretty good(if somewhat by-the-formula)read.<br />  Until I got to the end  and found the ending totally unsatisfying.  Without giving it away, I still  had alot of questions as to what happened to whom at the end. Ms.  Christofferson did not tie up her lose ends. Hate that!	2000-04-25

This is the second one in a row I can't even finish (ok did cheat and read the last chapter).<br />I felt like I'd read this book 100 times before.  Same heroine, same prickly hero, with a murder thrown in to throw them together.  Also I didn't really  warm up to either character, which makes it hard to care what happens to  them.<br />Don't waste your time on this snoozer.

Daughter gets lost in the wilderness.  She also happens to have Down Syndrome.  What follows is a totally believable and gripping story of  the family and it's ordeal.<br />Can't say much more than that without giving  away too much of the story.  I was VERY glad to see that none of the other  reviewers gave away the ending (a pet peeve of mine on Amazon).

Stuck right to the formula on  that, and just about everyone met their &quot;deserved&quot; end.<br />One  other reviewer called Dr. Goldberg's books a guilty pleasure and I much  agree.

Dirk Pitt adventures are usually pretty fun. BUT what more can U ask for?  World wide devastation, Nazis, comets, treasure, caved in mines, shootouts, crashing vehicles, flying aircars,  sunken submarines, beautiful women, handsome brave heroes....what else is  there?<br />While I think of Mr. Cussler's novels as &quot;guy books&quot; the  fact that I'm a thirty something mom of two didn't stop me from totally  enjoying this book.  The plot moves fast, there's alot of action.  At times  you are thinking &quot;come on&quot; when Dirk and his pals take on  unimaginable odds and win.  But it's sort of like an action movie with  James Bond or Arnold, fun if a bit unbelievable.<br />The plot twists and  turns and when I thought &quot;it's over&quot; it wasn't.  Even Mr. Cussler  shows up as a character in this book.  One thing though &quot;WHO was the  leak at Numa&quot;?  That never got answered.  AND the advertising?...Dirk  and his girlfriend drink Ray Martin Cabernet.  Ray Martin gets plugged  several times...wonder if Mr. Cussler is in the wine business?<br />Those were  my only two gripes in an otherwise fun, fun book.  My favorite Dirk Pitt  adventure so far.

BUT there is a HUGE editing mistake in that Alex delivers &quot;exciting news&quot; to his family twice in a couple of chapters. I thought I was losing it until I  went back and confirmed this.  How did Patterson AND the editors miss THAT?<br />And while I read this book in pretty much one sitting, I agreed with  another reviewer who said the &quot;duke it out at a Club Med Resort  Ending&quot; is old hat.  My main problem with the ending involved  Christine and I can't explain it without giving away the plot.  But suffice  to say as I was reading that part I was like &quot;oh give me a  break&quot;.<br />One other point, Morgan Freeman (great actor that he is)  is way, way, too old to play Alex.  How about Denzel or even Ving Rhines?  Halle Barry would be great as Christine...	2000-02-04

Rising Phoenix was a good (notice I say GOOD not GREAT) thriller as well.<br />Unlike some of the reviewers I really like Mark Beamon, the &quot;hero&quot; of Kyle  Mills books.  His sense of humor and unhealthy lifestyle are a nice change  from alot of &quot;heroes&quot; in other books. The pace moves quickly and  keeps you interested.  A few times I found myself saying &quot;Now that was  dumb Mark, why don't U do this&quot;.  Of course being a reader you tend to  have both sides of the story so it's easy to know what to do.<br />Glad I  waited to get this book in paperback, but it's definitely worth a read.	2000-01-18

It could have been better, in my opinion, if the heroine was a bit more sympathetic.

He also  is in love with his partners wife, who was his first love 20 years ago!!  Get over it buddy will ya!!  I found nothing likable, sympathic or empathic  in this guy.  Not to mention the book had a dumb ending, screaming SEQUEL.  I won't be wasting my time or money on it. I had high hopes for this book,  as I really like werewolf tales.

I agree with the reviewer below who compared this book with John Sandford's &quot;Prey&quot; series.  Blackbird Singing's hero, Tom Hopkins, is very similar to the Lucas Davenport hero of the Prey series. The only  reason I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars is because you need a  scorecard to keep track of who's who and who does what for whom.  Otherwise  I really enjoyed this book and hope to see more stories involving Tom  &quot;Hoop&quot; Hopkins.	1999-07-08

To have someone find a tape of the Kennedy assassination that proves beyond a doubt that there was a gunman on the &quot;grassy knoll&quot;.  I bought this book eagerly expecting an  interesting thriller.  Was I disappointed!  Like another reader, I gave it  two stars, not one, on the interesting premise.  Too bad it goes no further  than that.  After the great plot idea, the story goes downhill. The dad is  dead, then he isn't, the only tape is stolen, then there is another copy,  the good guy is bad, then he is good etc, etc.  I had alot of unanswered  questions too, why would a woman marry someone who took her tape and then  called her a liar?  Why and by whom was she murdered?  None of this was  answered as were many other questions I don't want to ask, should you still  feel a need to read this book.  Seems to me Mr. Frey wants to be another  John Grisham, and unless he improves his style and tightens up his plot  lines, it's not gonna happen.  Don't waste your time on this dog.	1999-07-07

I've read the whole Prey series but found this book a bit &quot;graphic&quot;.  So if you have a weak stomach, try another Prey book  first.  Course this book IS about a  serial killer, so if you have a weak stomach, what are U doing here anyway?  Keep up the good work Mr. Sandford!!	1999-05-27

Greatly enjoyed the story, but I felt the mystery resolved itself a little too neatly.  I really liked Robin and her boyfriend George.  This won't be my last Robin Light book, I now am  planning on reading the whole series.	1999-03-25

Then I went in and checked my kids, to be sure &quot;everything is all right&quot; with our world.  I found this book very scary.  I'll never look at a lowly ant the same way  again.  The way all of nature is related is something I never really  thought about before.  And the chain of events in this book shows how when  one species fails, it affects another and so on and so on..... Could have  been edited down some but overall a very good, scary read.	1999-02-22

I really enjoyed it.  Faith seems like the kind of woman who could live next door, someone you'd want for a friend.  Her habit of falling into mysteries (alluded to in this book  as happening in previous books) makes for fun, fast reading.  My only  criticism?  Her child is TOO good, never around, never fussing.  But then  if he was a normal kid, Faith would be like the rest of us, never getting  ANYTHING done. If you enjoy mysteries, you'll love Faith.  I'll be reading  the rest of the series for sure!	1999-02-15

Fatith Fairchild from the fictional Aleford, Massachusetts is the kind of woman you'd like to have for a friend.  Her habit of falling into mysteries and murders makes for fun, quick reading.  This book explores the somewhat  shady world of NE antiques, after Faith's house is broken into and a friend  is killed when her house is burglarized.  As other readers have noted, the  ending is somewhat contrived but up till then, I really loved this book.  Start with her earlier novels as Faith has grown from a new young wife, to  mom, to mom of two.  My only problem with these books?  Faith's kids are SO  good.  Never fuss, whine, wet their pants at the wrong moment.  Course if  they were written as normal kids, Faith would never get anything done, like  the rest of us moms!!	1999-02-15

It was good, but not great in my opinion. I'll say the twisted ending was REALLY good and unexpected.  But I found the rest of the book kinda predictable.  Also the  bad guy is almost supernatural in his abilities.  He manages to steal a  fireman's uniform and break into an FBI safehouse faster than you can yell  &quot;Fire&quot;.  Don't firemen lock their firehouses?  There were a few  other examples like this, that I felt really stretched believability and  detracted from the story.  For Mr. Deaver's next book, I'll wait for the  paperback.	1999-01-31

I look forward to the third book.	1999-01-18

I think Mr. Oppenheimer was very through in his research.  Unfortunately, it doesn't reflect very well on Mrs. Kennedy.  Course her children (well some of them including my esteemed Congressman, Joe ) don't reflect very  well on her anyway. Mr. Oppenheimer must have ate, drank and slept the  Kennedy/Skakels for a long time to come up with everything in this book.  If you like the Kennedy's and biographies, you'll like this book.  Well,  maybe not like Ethel, but appreciate how thorough the background and  research was in The Other Mrs. Kennedy.	1999-01-18

That is, I read Mr. Furhman's other book &quot;Murder in Greenwich&quot; first.  AND LOVED IT.  GREAT BOOK, CHECK IT OUT!  This is the first OJ book I read.  Like everyone else I was OJ'd  out-big time.  But Mr. Furhman does a fine job in his first book.  Alot of  the evidence he mentions was brought up at trial but there is alot of  things he noticed/discovered that was never brought up.  He really redeems  himself, showing that he is an excellent detective, hung out to dry by OJ's  manipulative defense team.  I'll be reading all of his books in the  future.	1999-01-18

Having read alot of true crime stories (like Ann Rule), I grabbed this book the minute I saw it.  Mark Fuhrman does a great job of investigating this murder, reviewing the facts, re-interviewing alot of the witnesses and  presents an excellent hypothesis of who, how and why the murder was  committed.  He has a great sense of humor, dotting the book with ironic  comments and even laughing off the Greenwich Police Departments attempts to  stop him.  I can see why they would feel threatened by an author as  thorough as Mark Fuhrman. .  Which isn't to say that I agree with him 100%,  I think it is possible there were two people involved in killing Ms.  Moxley, as they changed their stories twenty years later.  But  I wonder if  we'll ever know the truth, a la Jon Benet Ramsey (Mark, GET on THAT case  will ya?). Let's hope this book brings some justice in this otherwise  mishandled case.  You really have to feel badly for Ms. Moxley's family, to  not know the truth after all these years.  I really enjoyed Mr. Fuhrman's  writing style and sardonic comments on the witnesses and others involved.  For instance, an official told Fuhrman &quot;he routinely turned down  requests for interviews on this case&quot;.  Fuhrman then tells how he sits  down at his VCR and watched the gentleman's television interviews with Hard  Copy,  A Current Affair, Unsolved Mysteries and several other programs.  A really good read for true crime fans. Now I'm off to read - Murder in  Brentwood.	1999-01-09

I spent several nites reading it, when I should have been wrapping it. The premise is great, the eyewitness accounts fascinating but they left out SO MUCH.  Like what, you  ask?  The Titanic, Bruno Hauptmann, any mention of the Lindeburgh  kidnapping, The Hindenburg, Amelia Airheart... to name a few.  You can  probably find more things, depending on your own interests.  I realize they  couldn't include EVERYTHING (it was a long 100 years) but to give OJ a page  and a half, same for Princess Diana and not mention some of the above?  Not  a bad book, but could have been a GREAT one.	1999-01-04

While I enjoyed the book, I was halfway thru and knew how it would end, the results of the heroines search for her mother, etc. etc.  I  agree with other readers about the ending.  Kinda a downer.  Took a star  off the rating for that! Not Barbara Delinsky's best, but still a good  read.	1999-01-04

After having been disappointed with a couple of his more recent works, Fear Nothing, has me firmly back in the Koontz fold. I enjoyed it's similarity to Watchers (which still remains with Lightning my two favs) and  really liked the Chris Snow character.  Anyone who has ever had a dog,  can't help but like Orson. Some other reviewers have commented that the  book was too wordy, a little-I have to agree, hence the 4 not 5 stars. But  I managed to read it in one sitting, not easy to do with two little ones  running around.  Looking forward to the sequel, which apparently came out  yesterday.  Think I'll get that one in hardcover.	1998-12-31

Except for the heroes constantly going into dark places ALONE looking for the murderer.  Anyone who has ever seen a horror movie knows better than that.  Otherwise I would have given it 5, not 4 stars.  A really good, fast read  about a regular guy whose life takes a horrible turn one ordinary day; when  an ordinary looking man shoots him, then  rapes and kills his wife. Joining  forces with a seen-it-all detective, they hunt for the serial murderer who  is always one step ahead of them. If you enjoy a good book, check this one  out.	1998-11-14

Better luck next time.	1998-11-14

I debated a long time between giving this book three or four stars.  I  read it in one day, so it was interesting and intriguing enough that it was  hard to put down.  But as I finished it, I was sad and rather  depressed.<br />I guess I liked it but it's left me really down.  If he writes  another book, I'd read it.

That is, until the last couple of chapters.  As other readers have  commented, it does leave one hanging.  Up until that point, I would have  given it 5 stars.<br />Still, the murder mystery was interesting and well  done.  I guessed who did it and changed my mind several times.  Always the  sign of a well written mystery.  You really come to care about the main  characters, maybe that is why the ending was so frustrating.<br />I do  recommend this book, with reservations.  I plan to read Ms. Sloan's, Guilt  by Association as soon as possible.  Look for my review!!	1998-08-23
