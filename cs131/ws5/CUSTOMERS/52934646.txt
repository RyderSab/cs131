It is difficult to take existing characters and create new stories -- you always piss someone off (like the X-Files novels did for me). Mr. Zahn has an uncanny grasp of the Star Wars characters that took my breath away.<br />This novel picks up 5 years after Return of the Jedi leaves off. Leia and Han are pregnant, Luke is teaching Leia about the force, and the New Republic is finding its legs after the defeat of the Emperor and Darth Vader. A cunning new Grand Admiral has taken over the reigns of the shattered Empire and is plotting against the New Republic. A military genius, he has a few tricks up his sleeve that might tip the balance in the continuing power struggle for the galaxy. Do not pass up this novel, and be sure to continue on to Dark Force Rising, the next novel in this trilogy.	2000-10-13

From the same universe as Nancia (Partnership), Tia (The Ship Who Searched), Simeon (The City Who Fought), and Helva (The Ship Who Sang), comes Carialle. Because she was deformed at birth, Carialle underwent surgery and is enclosed inside a shell. As a &quot;shellperson&quot;, Carialle is placed inside a spaceship which she controls entirely with her mind. Her and her partner (a &quot;brawn&quot; named Keff) then blast off on a dangerous mission to find intelligent life in the universe.<br />She and Keff find other sentient beings on an uncharted planet, but something strange is going on. The inhabitants, who appear to be human, demonstrate awesome magical powers! Ruling over a lower caste of slaves, these people are colorful and passionate, and constantly waging magical wars with one another.<br />Carialle and Keff discover the secrets this world holds, and find that nothing on Orza is what it appears to be. The magicians themselves don't even know the true mysteries behind their powers. A wonderful novel, I heartily recommend it.	2000-10-13

The movie took some serious liberties with the book, presumably to make it translate better to a film (i.e. stepped-up sex, violence, and controversy).  The written word, however, can go to depths that the film can not.<br />The character of Ellie Arroway is fleshier and juicier when we are allowed into her most intimate thoughts.  A friend of mine, upon seeing me reading the book remarked that the movie was &quot;boring&quot; and that it &quot;dragged&quot;.  I found the movie and the book intriguing because Sagan delves deeper into questions I've pondered about in the wee hours of the morning with roommates and close friends and asks the questions that never even entered our minds.  Sagan probes the relationship between religion and science and the mutual animosity its respective champions have for each other and their doctrines.<br />The building of the Machine sent (by extraterrestrials from Vega) as a plan over radio waves is almost a secondary plot thread, taking a back seat to more pressing political, theological, and scientific concerns.  Imagine receiving this plan in today's world.  How many people would assume it was a doomsday machine, or from the devil, or that it was a summons that could not be ignored from a higher technology?  How many people would insist we build the Machine, and how many would insist that we should not?  How does the world-wide community reconcile its differences, and &quot;get along&quot; so the Machine, which can not be done by one country alone, be built?  Fascinating and thought-provoking for me, apparently 'boring' for others, I recommend it wholeheartedly.	2000-10-13

This work is, without a doubt, is Stephen Kings finest.  A biologically engineered disease is leaked from a government facility by a frightened worker who leaves the facility after he's been infected.  The highly contagious 'superflu' spreads like wildfire through America and quite probably the rest of the world.  Those who are infected develop flu-like symptoms and then die.  America is in a sudden panic, but no one can escape the disease -- nobody but the people who are mysteriously immune to it.  With most of the population of the United States (and possibly the world) dead, the survivors begin to band together.  Everyone has more vivid dreams, and their dreams all call them to one of two places to follow one of two leaders.  The indomitable Flagg pops up again to lead the 'dark element' of what is left of America, and an elderly lady takes her place as the leader of the 'good element'.  What ensues is a war which places all of their lives and souls in jeopardy.	2000-10-13

I originally read this book for a college course about the ethics of genetics. It is something every person in the biological or natural sciences should read, but it is also helpful for anyone interested in genetics. It is primarily about the politics and ethics which surround all genetic issues. Cook-Deegan explains the rudiments of genetics in a very easy to understand manner, and then launches into an in-depth examination of the politics of genetics. More goes on behind the scenes of biological science than you would ever believe. In the coming years genetics and the ethical issues surrounding genetics are going to become very important in medicine, pharmaceutical research, and criminal forensics. No longer just a class for science majors, genetics may well enter your life in ways you never expected. Cook-Deegan's book can definately educate as well as entertain.	2000-10-13

As a lover of all things Egyptian as well as all things Anne Rice, it was with much anticipation that I picked up this book. I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed with this novel. Ramses is an immortal man who is cursed with insatiable hungers for food, women, and drink. He entombed himself during Cleopatras time, and does not awaken again until the year 1914 when an English Egyptologist uncovers his resting place and brings him to London. Coming to his senses in England, Ramses immediately begins to cause trouble and consume everything in his path. Handsome and charming, he is refused nothing. Even so, he longs for his ancient Egypt and makes a horrible mistake in his efforts to curb his desire. He endangers the woman he has come to love, as well as all of London! Not a bad story altogether, but it's not one of my favorites, either.	2000-10-13

It used to be that this was the only 'laypersons' book out there for people suffering from IBD. Newly diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 10 years ago, I found this book to be enlightening and informative. It helped me to get a handle on things when I felt my life spiraling out of control due to a disease I had never even heard of before. Today those suffering from ulcerative colitis and Chrohn's Disease have more reading material at their disposal, but this book remains as the staple for any person suffering from IBD. It can also serve as an invaluable resource to friends and family of IBD survivors who also feel confused and helpless. Anyone who has ever taken prednisone for IBD knows the symptoms and treatments for these diseases can make articulate and unemotional explanations almost impossible to formulate.

When I was in school, I never thought to question the contents of my textbooks or the lectures of my teachers.  I had not learned skepticism or how to question the assumed authority of the written word.  I didn't understand what racism was (nobody talked about it then) let alone that many of the early Americans were rampant racists.  With the reading of The Crucible in high school I began to understand the power the written word can take as a social commentary and how the truth can be distorted into something completely unrecognizable.  By the time I was in college I learned not to believe everything I read, and that history is not written in stone.  There are unanswered questions, there are varying accounts, there are downright discrepancies.  This book has been extremely informative, in giving the part of American history that the text books leave out.  It may not be necessary to have complete disclosure in that 4th grade history text, but it could add some of the other (often dark) facets to the personalities of our 'American heroes'.  Very informative and intriguing, I recommend to history buffs and those who question authority alike.	2000-10-13

Of course, Meren never rests, and this trip also has another purpose. The bodies of the heretic, Ahkenaten, and his queen, Nefertiti, are to be entombed near Meren's estate until a proper place for them can be constructed. Those who were injured during Ahkenatens rule tried to interrupt his eternal rest by disturbing the bodies and looting the tombs. It is most important to King Tut that his brother and sister-in-law are properly cared for in death.<br />Unfortunately, Merens sister, Idut, has planned a feast for his homecoming despite his express directions to the contrary. His estate is crawling with relatives who squabble, meddle in his romantic life, and accuse him of shirking family duties. To make matters worse, Pharoah shows up, wanting to make sure the bodies are properly entombed.<br />As Meren is at his wits end, his cousins wife turns up dead, her body found in a granery.

Stewart, however, has based much of her story on historical record, which lends a certain ring of truth that other versions do not have. The story is told from Merlin's point of view and begins with his childhood and the uncertain parentage that people believe gave him his extraordinary abilities. As the High King's advisor, his prophecies unfailingly come to pass, much to the surprise of some and despite the orchestrations of others. His intelligence helps guide the kingdom through the dark times and into the light.<br />Through Merlin's eyes Arthur, Ygraine, Uther, Guenever and Morgause are created anew. He shows us their loves, their secrets, their treachery, and their lives. The magician shows us much that is hidden from plain view, and the scandalous truths that even Arthur himself does not know.

I so enjoyed The Clan of the Cave Bear series that I wanted to read more novels in the same genre. A story about pre-historic Native Americans, People of the Wolf is set among the mammoth hunters of the ice ages. The people live in clans, and are dependent upon each other for their survival. The undisputed leaders of the clans are Dreamers--men and women who have a connection with the spirit world. The spirits advise them in Dreams, and help them lead their clans. The people must be careful to keep the spirits, happy, of course, or they may abandon the Dreamer or the clan. But what happens when two dreamers in the same clan have differing opinions? The people are forced to choose between the young man with the Dream of Wolf in his eyes and the trusted older Dreamer who may be past his prime. One will lead them to a new land of abundance and promise, the other will lead them to death by slow starvation.<br />The couple who wrote the novel are anthropologists who obviously know about the lives and customs of the people they portray. Free of the annoying stereotypes that often accompany these topics, the characters are vibrant and original. Even if you've never been a fan of Native American history or novels of pre-history (and I never thought I would be!) you may find yourself loving this book.	2000-10-09

You often hear references made to star-crossed literary couples such as 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Catherine and Heathcliff'. It is telling that this work is important enough to be referenced alongside Shakespeare<br />The only novel written by Emily (her sisters Charlotte and Anne were more prolific), the tale takes place on the moors of England. Catherine Earnshaw is surprised when her well-to-do father brings home a mysterious foundling and names him Heathcliff. A dark and brooding child, Heathcliff nonetheless becomes Catherines playmate and confedant.<br />Their relationship changes, however, as Catherine grows into a woman. She begins to think that a lady of her station should not be dallying with a foundling such as Heathcliff, who has no family or wealth. She is wrapped in her own vain self-worth, and beings to spur the bewildered Heathcliff.<br />A moody and potentially violet man, Heathcliff retreats further into himself the worse Catherine treats him. He never stops loving her, his passion endures even her scorn. The end of their love affair is both beautiful and tragic.<br />A great triumph of writing by a woman of her time, Emily died shortly after her novel was published. As a historical note, the three sisters published their work under pen names. This ruse was concocted so publishers wound presume the works were written by men, and would therefore be taken seriously.	2000-10-09

Lord Meren has always been suspicious about the deaths of the Pharoah Akhenaten and The Great Royal Wife, Nefertiti. He becomes convinced that Nefertitis death was caused by ingestion of poison, not the plague as originally assumed. Her death occurred years before, and the killer has had some time to cover their tracks. Meren must dig deep to find the real cause of Nefertitis death.<br />The killer becomes aware of Merens inquiries, and makes a bold move. King Tutankhamun is attacked and Meren is suspected of the crime. As a reader, this is the weak spot in the plot for me. After years of loyal service, one would think Meren was beyond reproach, and the King would insist on his innocence. Perhaps Robinson is making a statement about Tutankhamuns youth and immaturity, or that rulers can truly trust no one.<br />Robinson takes a different path with this novel, alternating between time periods with each chapter. We learn a great deal more about the reign of Ahkenaten and Nefertiti. What happened in their time is so important, as it sets the stage for the motivation behind Meren and King Tutankhamuns actions in the three previous novels.<br />I am especially excited about the manner Robinson portrays Queen Nefertiti. She was queen in name and in fact - she took on many royal tasks that Akhenaten found distasteful or difficult. His reign might have been even more disastrous if it were not for her influence on the king, and her diplomacy in politics and religion.	2000-10-09

I forgot to send back the little paper telling the book club I didn't want it. When I read the jacket, however, I was intensely interested. The book featured a strong female character, Cassie Black. She's an ex-con currently trying to get her life back on track while on probation and working for a car dealership in LA.<br />Cassie went to prison after a burglary in a Las Vegas casino went sour. She did her time and came out trying to be straight. Unfortunately, she has secrets, and she desperately wants to leave the country. For that she needs money. A lot of money. She takes another job in Las Vegas. It also ends badly, and now she's on the run from Jack Karch, a pretty scary dude who likes to bring folks out into the desert, shoot them dead and bury them.<br />One of the more interesting parts about this book is that none of the characters are what we would traditionally call good. They're pretty much all ex-cons, killers, or other folks who fracture the occasional law. Cassie is what we might call an anti-heroine, as after all, she does rob people of their winnings in Las Vegas. Despite that, she's still human and feels love and loss like anyone else. The book holds several surprises, some of which are revealed in the other reviews here (bad form, people!). The author deliberately holds back certain details until the right time, which makes it an excellent piece of storytelling.	2000-10-09

This book is entirely about and told from the point of view of rabbits. Don't laugh, it's definitely more than I bargained for when I first picked it up. A group of rabbits is evicted from their warren and must find a new home. Traveling is not easy for rabbits because they are so skittish and nervous.

The groups of rabbits have their own legends and moral tales that they pass on from generation to generation by word of mouth. This novel was also made into an animated feature of the same name, though it's definitely not for children.

I have to admit, I was intruiged by the cover, as well as the title. I do enjoy historical fiction, and this novel did not disappoint. Only after beginning to read this novel did I discover that it was second in a series, the first being The Queen's Man. The story is set in England of 1193, truly the 'Dark Ages'. Young Justin de Quincy, who happens to have Queen Eleanor's (the mother of the infamous John and the famous Richard the Lionhearted) ear is thrust into the center of courtly politics. Richard is missing, captured somewhere off in the Crusades, and Prince John is making dangerous a bid for power.<br />This is not the only trouble Quincy is involved in, however. A poor young woman was brutally murdered in a graveyard late at night. Two well-to-do brothers are suspected of the crime, one who was romantically linked to the girl, and the other who wished he could have her favors. Quincy is called upon to help solve the murder and bring the killer to justice. Quincy must be a resourceful man, they don't call him 'The Queen's Man' for nothing, but can he solve this complicated crime? One of the most intriguing parts of the novel is just how law enforcement solves a murder in 1193 without fingerprints or crime-scene forensics.	2000-10-09

The first in this series of novels has Lord Meren investigating a murder in the sacred Place of Anubis. For those unfamiliar with Egyptian religion, Anubis was the God of Embalming. Bodies were embalmed, a long and laborious process, before being entombed. Egyptians believed that without the proper spells, amulets, and procedures after death, a soul, or ka would not enter the afterlife.<br />This being known, it is unthinkable that someone would kill in the Place of Anubis. This person must have been most desperate and bold in order to do so. Meren discovers there is no lack of suspects. The man was disliked by his collegues and his family alike. Suspects are going fast, however, two of them are murdered before the true nature of the crime is discovered. At the heart of these crimes is an unholy greed that could consume Meren and his son Kysen before they discover the truth.	2000-10-09

In the Forward and Introduction to this novel the Gears explain (partly through narration and partly through a modern day short story of the plight of an archaeologist to save historical sites) a bit more about the peoples in the novel. The People of the River used their waterways to trade. A society run much like the feudal states of Medieval Europe, the masses must pay tribute to the Sun Chief, their spiritual leader. When crops fail and the villages cannot afford their tributes, the Sun Chief greedily demands his tithe, and then takes it by force. Starving and disillusioned, the villages rebel in a bloody war. Their Sun Chief dethroned, the people must now place their trust in a young girl who is studying to be their Dreamer, and who must lead them into a new age.	2000-10-09

This novel is a great piece of historical fiction, and it's not just for women, either. Set in the American Civil War, the story is about the life of a Georgian Southern Belle who is abruptly thrust from her pampered plantation life into the harsh realities of a very brutal war. Only her courage, strength, and resourcefulness get her through the wartime travails. That, however, is only the beginning of her struggles. After the war Scarlett faces the challenges of poverty, loneliness and death. She ends up being married three times (and burying two of her husbands), owning her own businesses, killing a soldier (and stealing the money and goods in his pockets), and generally doing everything considered unladylike at the time. Fictional characters set in an historic time, this book is a classic in every sense of the word. I've read it countless times (I still get something new out of it each time) and it should be in every well-read persons library. The movie of the same name follows the story closely (although some things had to be left out in the interest of time), stars Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, and is widely regarded as one of the best films ever made.	2000-10-09

If he chooses his wife and children, the great drought may continue and the people will wage bloody wars for food and land. If he chooses to follow his Dreams, he may be consumed in order that his people may live. This second story in The First North Americans Series builds upon the legends created in the first novel. A compelling tale, I suffered and triumphed along with the characters.	2000-10-09

Set in Rice's favorite town of New Orleans, this beautifully crafted novel is a must read. Rice follows the trials of a mulatto family who struggle to find happiness in the 1840s. This novel is not only a poignant and moving story, it is also unique. New Orleans of the 1840s is a world apart from our own, ripe with new adventures to explore. The story follows young Marcel who is the son of an aristocratic plantation owner and his African-American mistress. Marcel strives to live up to the expectations he has set for himself, and struggles under the caste system prevalent in the city of New Orleans. His experiences, as well as those of his sister, his mentor, and his best friend finally lead him to recognize the truths about life he'd known all along.	2000-10-09

The second in this series of books involving Lord Meren finds him investigating another murder. A giant statue of King Tutankhamun is being erected inside the temple of Amun. Early one morning before most workers have begun their tasks, a pure one falls from the scaffolding and is killed. This man was one of Merens informers inside the temple, and Meren concludes that the death was no accident.<br />As Meren investigates, he exposes a rift between the priests of Amun and Pharoah. The priests, most notably Meren's estranged cousin, do not like him meddling in something they consider to be an internal affair. They thwart his attempts to discover the murderer by removing witnesses and altering crime scenes.<br />As more evidence is uncovered, two of the suspects are murdered. Who is trying to cover their tracks, and how many people are involved? Meren enjoys some protection from political back-biting as the 'Eyes and Ears of Pharoah', but King Tut becomes angry with Meren over the young kings first military campaign. Word spreads quickly through court and temple of the kings disfavor, and Meren no longer has the safety net he needs to investigate crimes.

It's considered a 'classic' and a book that young people should read before college. It is both of those things, but it is also an excellent novel to read for pleasure.<br />The story takes place in Maycomb, Alabama during the 1930's. A time and place very alien to most of us in the modern world. At the center of the story is Scout, a fiesty young tomboy, just old enough to go to school. She has an older brother, Jem, and the two of them get into all sorts of scrapes. They enjoy play-acting and spinning scary tales about the spooky town recluse, Boo Radley.<br />The other plot strand involves their father, Atticus Finch, who is the town lawyer. Atticus is called upon to defend an African-American man who has been accused of raping a white woman. The reader can imagine the climate of the town towards African-Americans at that time. The town is rampant with racism, and Atticus has his work cut out for him. Not because the accused is guilty, but because it's likely that the 12 white men sitting on the jury will convict him even if he's innocent.<br />Lee's mastery is shown when the two plot strands come together in a spectacular way, resulting in danger for the Finch family and the man Atticus has sworn to defend.<br />Sadly, this Pulitzer Prize winner was the only novel Lee ever wrote.	2000-10-09

Others I couldn't wait to finish (I always finish a book I've started, no matter how bad it gets!).  He is either on his game or off it.  In The Eyes of the Dragon, he is very much on his game.  It is a departure from his normal fare of vampires, undead, aliens, and serial killers.  His brings us into a world of fantasy complete with kings, dragons, heroes, and the inevitable Bad Guy.  The villain is one us SK fans have seen before in such incarnations as 'The Walkin' Dude' from The Stand.  Yes, it's Flagg, playing the part of the evil sorcerer.  Quite effectively, I might add.<br />I was delighted to pick up this book and find SK taking a wild gamble into a new genre.  Yes, there are the obligatory graphic scenes, but I've read worse (Clive Barker, anyone?).  I expect it and, yes, I take a sick fascination in some grotesque descriptions.  I love to REACT to my reading, even if it is only to say &quot;EEW!&quot; and grimace.  The Eyes of the Dragon is a wonderful tale of castle intrigue and heroism that has you rooting for the good guys and loving to hate the seemingly immortal Flagg.	2000-10-09

A true classic, I found an old copy in my mothers house and devoured this book one hot summer. It has been made into several motion pictures, the most recent of which being in 1996 starring William Hurt.<br />The heroine of the novel, Jane Eyre, ends up in a strict boarding school after her parents die and her only living relative, and aunt, can no longer stand her 'wickedness'. She endures hardships at school, and the school mistress tries to dampen her passion and opinions.<br />Jane does not lose her spirit, she merely hides it behind her plain face and grows into a proper lady of her station. She graduates from school and takes on a position as a tutor for a young French girl, the ward of a Mr. Rochester. She is given a room in his large house the likes of which she has never seen in her former spartan existance. She falls in love with the little girl as well as Mr. Rochster.<br />Rochester is hiding a tragic secret however. One that he kept from Jane and everyone else for many years. The truth is finally exposed and Jane is heartbroken. This, however is not the end of our tale. Their love does not die, and the end of the novel is poignant and romantic. I guarantee it will have you in tears.<br />Charlotte's writing is beautiful, moving, and descriptive. She is unmatched as a mistress of character development.	2000-10-09

The longest novel of the series so far, this one is undoubtedly my favorite. Set in the pre-historic Great Lakes region, the story follows the Trader, Otter, and his strange crew of a woman fleeing her past, a warrior with a secret, and a holy man known as a Contrary. A spiritual leader like a Dreamer, the Contrary sees the world with such clarity that he does everything backwards. Often frustrating to the people around him, the Contrary makes for some raucous humor as the quartet make their way through the Great Lakes. Traveling through strange lands, they encounter peoples and places that they had only heard about in legends and myths. At the end of their often dangerous and ever entertaining journey they must all confront their destinies.	2000-10-09
