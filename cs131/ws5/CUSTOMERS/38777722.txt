US	38777722	R12ZP4UQ1ILQWR	0446610445	288813085	That Summer	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Slightly disappointing	As a long time Joan Wolf fan, her name on the cover is enough for me to buy the novel as soon as I see it. I like Joan Wolf's writing style, and this book was no exception to that.  I do think that her latest books have not been as polished or engaging as her regency ones.  I don't know if she is uncomfortable with modern day or what, but these stories don't flow as smoothly as earlier ones.  Also, the heroine was slightly immature.  The story is that Anne comes back to town after her father dies.  Liam, the guy she has loved since 6, has been under suspicion for a murder for 10 years.  When the body is found, the suspicion kicks into overdrive.  Liam is a horse breeder. (Long term fans will not be surprised that horses figure heavily in the plot.)  Anne pursues Liam and, he is uninterested in her.  She persists.  Sometimes Anne seems like a high school student with a mad crush instead of an adult.  I liked the mystery and I've never read a Joan Wolf that I didn't finish.  I'll keep it, but it will never be my favorite.  If this would be your first Joan Wolf, try another one before this.	2003-09-03

I liked Dance Through Time so much better!  Lynn Kurland's books are funny and enjoyable.  This one was no exception.  Jamie was a good hero.  He was sufficiently arrogant at first and nicely mellowed at the end.  Elizabeth was adventurous, yet not too feisty to be interesting.  If you like time travel, you will like this.	2003-09-03

I had a really hard time getting into this book.  She spends way too much time setting up the story.  Over a hundred pages into the book there was still no murder or romance.  I did like the characters, and I will probably give the sequel a try before I completely give up.  I just felt this book had too much background and not enough action and plot.	2003-06-01
US	38777722	R261GVSRJPKTXQ	0373218192	514518766	Engaging The Enemy	Books	5	62	67	N	N	2 great classic stories	These are reprints of earlier category romance novels.  Both are very good.  Both feature slightly antagonistic relationships where the hero and heroine start at as enemies.  Nora Roberts is especially good at the volatile chemistry between these kinds of couples.  The first book, A Will and a Way forces 2 people to stay in a mansion together to win an inheritance.  Despite the fact that the heroine is named Pandora, this is a very good story.  It has a slight bit of suspense as the other relatives try to force them out of the mansion so they lose the inheritance.  The second book, Boundary Lines, is also very good.  Jillian inherits her grandfather's ranch and tries to keep feuding with Aaron Murdock.  This novel also features a slight bit of suspense, however the chemistry between the two main characters is what makes this story shine!  These are both good light reading, perfect for summer.	2003-04-29

I was looking forward to this book when I first heard about it, but I was unable to get a copy right away.  I decided to buy the newest Cordina book, Cordina's Crown Jewel, and read that one first.  Big mistake.  I couldn't even finish it.  As a result, I  put off reading this one until a friend told me I should.  It is very good.  It is early Nora Roberts so the mystery is not as developed as in her latest books, but it is there.  The stories follow the princess and 2 princes of Cordina.  The same bad guy appears in all 3 books. I liked the last two better than the first, but all three are definite keepers!	2003-04-19

I liked the 4th and 5th books.  I just didn't like them as much as previous installments.  In the Rescuer, I feel she is back on track.  I have always been interested in Stephen's story from the moment we meet him in the Negotiator.  Henderson doesn't disappoint.<BR>   Stephen is a complex character, a rescuer who no longer feels capable of rescuing others and in need of being rescued himself.  Events in his personal life have left him feeling lost and alone.  The only one he can turn to is his long time friend Meghan.  Most of the O'Malley novels can be stand alone books, although they are better read in sequence.  I don't recommend reading this one out of order.  At the very least, readers should finish the Healer before tackling this one.  The mystery plot was good also.  Each of those has been unique.  Henderson does a good job keeping the reader interested even though she tells us who the bad guy is at the beginning.<BR>   I only have two problems with this book, and they are minor.  The first is nit picky, I admit.  However, Meghan, one of the main characters, is blind.  Several times Henderson refers to her as \\"glancing\\" at somebody before speaking or acting.  That jumped out at me.  But the biggest complaint was that the book didn't give the \\"closure\\"  I was looking for in the finale.  The other O'Malleys are there in passing, like in other books, but she never really wraps things up.  There is nothing to suggest that this is the end to the series.  It's just the end of another book.<BR>   Other than those minor things, I enjoyed this story very much.  I would definitely recommend it to others.	2003-03-28

After reading her other ones, I was expecting another great comedy.  This one didn't deliver.  I liked the fact that having Deanna on the run added some suspense to the plot, but I just didn't find these characters as likeable as previous ones.  I also thought that having the hero be named Shepherd was over the top.  We were supposed to draw the parallel with him leading the heroine back to God.  That was too heavy handed for me.  I hope this is not an example of future stories from Mrs. Windsor.	2003-03-28
US	38777722	R30YFOLIANRVSJ	1551664941	1282817	The Cowboy	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Hero is not a cowboy!	As a Texas native who now lives in Oklahoma, I have seen my share of cowboys.  I know this may seem picky, but I couldn't get past the fact that Rafe was constantly described as wearing boots with flower or star patterns.  Note to Ms. Krentz:  No self respecting cowboy would allow himself to wear such prissy clothing!  Other than this obvious faux pas, the story seemed pretty much like the standard Krentz romance.  Arrogant man bent on revenge meets feisty heroine who convinces him revenge is not the answer.  I sometimes think Ms. Krentz's characters are interchangeable.  On the plus side, this is a light, breezy romance perfect for an easy read.  If you aren't expecting an original plot and you can stomach a cowboy with purple flowers on his boots, then this is the book for you.	2003-02-13
US	38777722	RZ8EIF3I3Q9MM	0446610437	923420109	High Meadow	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good, but not her best	This is the 2nd contemporary romance Joan Wolf has written.  I liked it, but I don't think it was as well written or cohesive as her Regency romances.  The plot wasn't as engaging and the characters weren't as detailed as her characters usually are.  Perhaps Wolf's greatest strength is her simple language that allows her to tell the reader many things without seeming to get bogged down in detail.  This allows her to bring to life her characters.  I just don't think she was as successful with these characters as she has been in the past.  Daniel and Kate seemed to be other characters she had done before rather than new and individual.  With any one else, I would call this a very good book, but I expect the extraordinary from Joan Wolf because she usually delivers.<BR>   The plot revolves around Daniel, a pro baseball player, realizing he has a son who is being raised by an aunt, Kate.  As Daniel attempts to become a part of his son's life, he also discovers he wants to become a part of Kate's life as well.  This is a nice sweet story about love and hope that Wolf fans will like.  But for a book you can love, check out her backlist!	2003-02-02

This was a good story that was interesting and well researched.  I felt that I was given a pretty good idea of what life in ancient Rome was like.  Once I started the book, I wanted to know what happened to all the characters.  I would have rated this book 5 stars except for one small thing.  I sometimes found it too graphic for comfort.  I like that Ms. Rivers portrayed the time period exactly as it was without whitewashing it, but I don't see this book being one I will read again and again.  It is a well written book that definitely leaves an impression.  To me, it was also disturbing.  It is definitely worth reading but not for the faint of heart.	2003-01-01
US	38777722	R1Q6RD5SX9D3J9	0373218036	249319124	Truly, Madly Manhattan	Books	5	39	39	N	N	Two winners	I liked both of these stories.  I think this is probably the best of the reprints that have come out lately.  These are early Nora Roberts books, so if you are looking for romantic suspense, you won't find it here.  I also think these 2 stories are more polished than some of the other early novels that have been released lately.  Of the two, Local Hero is my favorite.  Mitch writes comic books, and though Hester's son likes him, Hester is wary.  She is a serious bank manager who has been hurt by love before.  (By the way, I agree with the other reviewer that Hester is not the greatest of names!  Don't let that put you off.)  I found this story to be absolutely delightful.  Mitch is one of Ms. Robert's best heroes, in my opinion.  The second story, Dual Image, I liked just a little bit less.  It was also an interesting and well written story.  Ariel get the lead in Booth's screenplay which he wrote about his nasty ex-wife.  Even though Ariel seems different, Booth is not sure he trust her because she is, after all, an actress like his ex-wife and might be hiding her feelings.  To me, the only downside to the story was Booth's cynical attitude.  He pulls away from Ariel because she can't possibly be as good as she seems. The way he continually withdraws emotionally from Ariel got a bit tiring toward the end. Still, I did enjoy it.  I would give  Local Hero 6 stars if I could, and I would probably give Dual Image 4 and a 1/2.  Both are definitely keepers!	2003-01-01

Unlike other reprints form this year (Going Home, Table fot Two, etc...) this collection has some suspense thrown in which may appeal to fans of her later stuff.  The writing style is not as polished as the books she turns out these days but the stories are interesting, especially the last two.  I never really got into Risky Business.  I had to actually force myself to finish.  The mystery never interested me,and I didn't see any chemistry between the two main characters. Still, even Nora on a bad day is better than much of the romance you find out there.<br />  I liked Storm Warning better.  The two main characters had a history together.  I think Nora Roberts is especially good at reuniting old lovers.  Also, I liked the fact that this one seemed like an old fashioned who-done-it with a lot of romance mixed in.  This was my favorite of the three.  <BR>    The final book, The Welcoming, was also an entertaining story.  I liked both the main characters.  I think fans of Nora Roberts will not be disappointed in this collection, especially if they keep in mind that these are some of her earlier works.	2002-12-05

I liked it pretty well.  The main character, Frankie, was entertaining and funny.  I had a hard time buying the premise that sets up the novel though.  Frankie gets caught sleeping with her married partner who happens to be the police chief's son-in-law.  As a result, she is sent to SmallTown, USA.  It seemed to me that Ms. Hughes spent the whole book trying to convince us that Frankie, who was dumb enough to believe the cliche about the married man getting a divorce, was smart and savvy about everything else.  Other than that, I liked the book.  The secondary characters were suitably zany, and fish out of water stories, if done well, can be lots of fun.  This is good escape reading, and if you can overlook a few minor flaws, the book will leave you with a smile.	2002-11-07
US	38777722	R1SUGNLER2TYEN	0373218400	675121255	Table For Two	Books	4	22	23	N	N	Light and entertaining	This is another one of those reprints of early Nora Roberts, so if you are not a big fan of category romance, you might want to skip it.  I enjoyed these two books.  I thought her writing style was not as solid and polished as it was in later books, but still, I found these books to be entertaining.  There is no suspense just the story of two couples falling in love.<BR>  In the first, Summer Desserts, pastry chef Summer gets tangled up with hotel owner Blake.  I did find the obstacle keeping these two apart a little contrived.  The book was interesting and kept my attention, but after it was over, I didn't find myself anxious to read it again.<BR>  The second novel is about Summer's friend Carlo.  He is also a chef, and he is on a book signing tour to publicize his latest cookbook.  He wants to help publicist Juliet loosen up and discover romance.  Carlos is definitely a hero worthy of Nora Roberts.  He manages to be chauvanistic and liberated, laid back and intense, and of course sexy as well.  This book had me laughing.  Of the two, I think this one is funnier.  I expect to find myself reading it more often, but I am glad to have both to round out my collection.	2002-11-01

I finished both Hidden Star and Captive Star in one weekend.  I wish I had stopped there.  I liked Grace (the heroine of this book) better when she was just casually discussed by the other characters.  Once we actually meet her, I have a hard time understanding how Bailey and MJ could be best friends with her.  She is calculating and conniving.  She tries to manipulate people by using sex appeal.  I wasn't really fond of the hero, but I thought he deserved better than Grace.  I gave this 2 stars only because it closes off the trilogy.  If this book had been a stand alone book, I would have rated it 1 star.	2002-10-28

Yes, the beautiful blonde wallks into our hero's office, but how many other times is the hero standing in the middle of an overturned office plant and a pot of spilled coffee?  And the beautiful blonde wants to hire our hero to help her find HERSELF.  You see, she has amnesia and she thinks she may be in trouble.  This is Nora Roberts at her best.  Bailey and Cade are such wonderful characters that you can't help but get caught up in their adventure.  If you are a fan of Nora Roberts, you'll love this one.  If you just like romance and adventure in general, you'll be charmed too.	2002-10-28

MJ and Jack were definitely a great match.  There is a lot of action in this one, and a ton of sparks between MJ and Jack.  They rarely stop their bantering, and when they do, then they have fireworks of a different kind.  The plot on this one is a little far fetched, but none of the plots in this trilogy are very realistic.  This is escape reading at its best!	2002-10-28

I have read her other novels and with a few exceptions, I never really got into them. This one is different.  Maybe it is the idea of a prince falling in love with an average citizen.  Honestly, what little girl doesn't dream about that? Or maybe it is the fact that you can't help falling in love with the characters.  The plot is pretty standard, but the story doesn't feel standard.  It feels fresh, funny, and sweet.  If you want to take a vacation from your everyday life, open this book and travel to Pendaren, the fictional kingdom where the novel takes place.  You'll enjoy your visit.	2002-10-25

Unfinished Business and Mind over Matter were both good stories.  Fans of Nora Roberts' work will recogonize her trademark style, and though they didn't have the suspense her later work has, the plot was still entertaining.  I didn't like the middle story Island of Flowers.  It was very short, and in my opinion, none of the characters were very fleshed out.  I also didn't like how naive the heroine was in that one.  Nora's stories usually have strong, daring women.  That is one of my favorite things about her work.  I didn't like this heroine.  Buy it because of the first and third stories.	2002-10-24

Everyone who is at all a fan of romance or romantic suspense knows how popular Nora Roberts is.  Her books sell for a reason.  I think this series is Nora at her best.  All 4 of the books are filled with the strong characters, sexual tension, and suspenseful moments that make her such a good writer.  I also like having all the related books published together in one package.  <BR> Another thing that makes this series unique to me is how each of the books has a common element: the night, but still manages to be fundamentally different too.  The first, Night Shift, is pretty standard romantic suspense, but it is also well written.  Night Shadow is more fantasy with some supernatural elements thrown in.  Night Shade, the third and my favorite of the series, has the most fleshed out characters in my opinion.  The clash between the two main characters is what makes this story work.  Night Smoke, the last of the stories, is more a classic case of rich girl meets working class boy.  Nora adds suspense and good dialogue to raise it above the average romance.  Be warned though.  The subject matter IS a little dark in these novels.  They are grittier than standard romance novels.  If you are looking for light fluff, you might want to try some of her other novels.  But if you are looking for good romantic suspense, you can't go wrong here.	2002-10-24

Though I prefer romantic suspense, I don't mind straight romance for a change of pace.  I have many of her other books like the Night Tales, the Stanislaski series and the Stars of Mithra trilogy.  I also recently purchased Going Home.  All those are much better choices for her books than this.  These books didn't seem to have much going for them.  They weren't even good romances; they were just average.  Neither of the couples had any chemistry (an element which Nora is usually so adept at creating), and more importantly, I just didn't care what happened to the characters.  If you are a Nora fan, you might want to check it out of the library.  Compulsive collectors might want to buy it to fill out their collection, but otherwise, pick one of her many other and better books.	2002-10-24

If you read this book expecting a mystery, you will be disappointed.  However, I definitely think this book is in the Plum tradition like the author claims.  After all, the mysteries in the Plum novels often seem to take a backseat to the crazy characters as far as I can tell.  True, this book is predictable.  That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  But predictable doesn't mean boring.  The secondary characters were very, very funny.  If you're like me and enjoy a wide variety of stories, then you should check this book out.  It will make you laugh.  If the mere mention of the word romance makes you break out in a cold sweat, then you might want to steer clear.	2002-10-23

I especially liked the words \\"first in the Blackbird Sisters Series\\" because it means a chance for more books like this. I'm not sure I can relate to the heroine (not many of us can get to 31 without ever having a job) but I found her fun and interesting. The romantic interest was a guy who may or may not be Mafia. He was sweet, but also dark and mysterious. There was also a zany cast of characters. I'll definitely read the next one.	2002-10-23

I liked the ghost story and the movie set in Regency times.  My one complaint, and it is minor, is that I felt switching back and forth between the past and present caused the characters to be a little less fleshed out than normal.  Still, Joan Wolf doesn't write bad books.  Her writing style is always engaging.  This is a fun book.  Even Joan Wolf on her worst day is better than most of the books you see out there.  Joan Wolf fans will like her newest book.  If this is your first Joan Wolf, read a few of her marvelous Regencies before you make up your mind.	2002-10-23

The story begins after the heroine's husband dies and leaves his brother as the guardian of their son.

Right away, I want to know about these people.  She is an expert at drawing you in and making you care about the characters.  I noticed some reviewers were disappointed in the lack of sex scenes, but that is one of the reasons I like her books so well.

I was unsure about reading this book (especially when I saw that awful cover!), but a friend recommended I try it.  I'm glad she did.  This story had more depth than the typical romance.  The characters were more fleshed out, more like real people.  They had strengths and weakenesses.  This story deals with tough issues, but not by making light of those issues. There is humor, but also sensitivity and emotion. I read it through twice the first week I bought it.	2002-09-21

It was fun to catch up with all your old friends from previous books.  Also, this is the book we meet Shelly from Clouds and Jake from Waterfalls.  The two main characters, Brad and Alissa, were interesting but I cared about them less than some of the other people this series has introduced us to in the past.  The story of Rosie and her groom was a good addition.  In some ways, I cared more about Rosie's story than Alissa's.  It's a good book, but not up to this author's usual standards, in my opinion.	2002-09-20

(Though the O'Malley series is really good!)  I really liked this look behind the scenes at terrorism and how 2 people of faith handled the events of Sept. 11th.  I always feel proud to be an American and know there are men and women like the ones Dee Henderson writes about out there serving our country.  This one talked about the price those heroes pay mentally.  I enjoyed it.	2002-09-20

I love Meri as a character.  She gets herself in ridiculous situations but never manages to lose her sense of humor.  She would be the type of person you'd like to have as a friend.  Also, Jake is a great example of the clueless male.  Reading about these two people getting together is fun because you care about the characters.	2002-09-20

I love how the Lauren and K.C. get to know each other only through e-mails.  They learn more about the &quot;real&quot; person, not about the physical appearance.  The idea of pen pals becoming romantically involved is not a new one, but Robin Jones Gunn has the gift of making you care about the characters she creates.  Lauren is a great character who discovers the person she was meant to be over the course of the book.  And her crazy disasters make you smile.	2002-09-20

Sophy will make you laugh out loud with her crazy antics.  Charles is stuffy but redeemable, and his girlfriend is just the kind of character you can love to hate.  There are also some very funny minor characters and plenty of witty conversations.  If you have never read this book, you're missing out.	2002-09-04
US	38777722	R39AVYVCVB04O3	089190638X	12718685	Pistols for Two	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Lots of variety	This is a collection of short stories.  Each has the trademark Heyer humor.  I often re-read this book when I don't have a lot of time.  I can read one or two stories really quickly. Like all her books, this one is great.  I think this would be a good introduction to her books.  Try this and if you like it, try a longer novel next.	2002-09-04

I was instantly interested in these people's lives.  How will Joe react to Kelly's declaration of love?  Like any woman, I am also a sucker for a man in uniform, and Joe doesn't disappoint.  I also identified with Kelly's religious struggles.  I, too, have found myself merely going through the motions without examining why I am doing these things.  I highly recommend this book.	2002-09-04
US	38777722	R1PRT43WWCA29B	157673577X	306852563	Danger In The Shadows	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Wow!	I read this book in one sitting.  I was hooked from the moment I started.  I had heard this book talked about by a lot of friends, but I admit I was skeptical.  I didn't think &quot;christian fiction&quot; could be as suspenseful as the mainstream kind.  I'll be the first to admit I was wrong.  This is a great story which anyone would enjoy.  The characters seemed believable and the plot was thrilling.	2002-08-02

It was obvious she was going to put these 2 together in The Guardian.  I didn't think I would really be interested in their story.  I mostly bought the book to fill out my collection.  Boy, was I wrong!  I loved the plot of this one.  It was very fast paced.  The third installment is just as good as the first two.	2002-08-02

I've got the entire series on my keeper shelf, but I didn't like this one as much as the earlier ones.  I felt like the relationship between Rachel and Cole dragged, especially since their relationship had already started in The Protector.  I also thought the idea of a &quot;suprise wedding&quot; was a little far fetched.  I liked the book, just not as much as the other ones.  I still think Dee Henderson is an incredible writer, and I'm sure I'll read this one again, just not as often as I read the others.	2002-08-02

I especially liked how the message (about whether God really answers prayers) didn't overshadow the plot.  I enjoyed what she had to say and enjoyed being entertained while reading it.	2002-08-02

Firefighting is another interesting job, but I would have liked to see her focus more on Jack and Cassie and less on Rachel and Cole.  Sometimes it seemed to be turning into their story.  Still, the mystery was good and the characters are always enjoyable.	2002-08-02

I felt like the relationship between Rachel and Cole dragged, especially since their relationship had already started in The Protector.  I also thought the idea of a &quot;suprise wedding&quot; was a little far fetched.  <br />I also thought this plot was weaker than the other ones.  There seemed to be less mystery and more tying up loose ends.  It wasn't nearly as fast paced as the others.  I still give the book 4 stars because I like Dee Henderson's writing, and I think fans of the series will like it.	2002-08-02

I feel as if I know all the characters, and Kate and Dave are 2 of my favorites.  The best part of the book is the way Dee Henderson mixes christian values with a really terrific plot.	2002-08-02

I have only recently begun reading &quot;inspirational fiction&quot; because of my growing disenchantment with the usual content of fiction these days.  I was skeptical.  I expected heavy handed sermons, but Linda Windsor doesn't give that.  She does have a serious message, but that message is packaged in a delightful box!  I thought the two main characters were very funny, and as a klutz myself I could both laugh and sympathize with Sunny's accidents.  This was my first Linda Windsor book, but it won't be my last.	2002-08-01

This is my favorite Dee Henderson book.  I have all of them, but this is the one I like the best.  I loved the story and the glimpse into the lives of people in the military.  I also really liked how religion is not a heavy handed theme but gracefully woven into the story. The characters' belief helps them to put their lives at risk.  It made me personally want to thank all those men and women who serve their country so bravely.  And I absolutely loved Bruce's letters.  Some reviews didn't like Jill and Wolf's story getting almost equal attention.  I liked that.  They were interesting characters.  I like how Dee Henderson lets you get a full picture of her characters' lives.	2002-08-01
