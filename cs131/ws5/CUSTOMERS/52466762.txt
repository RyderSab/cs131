However, I can't recommend it because the author writes this book as if he is speaking to 3rd graders.  The author's tone seems to assume all readers of the book are clueless and need tiresome explanations about obvious points.  The book is also filled with un-funny side commentary that is intended (I guess) to make the technical material more readable-but it fails miserably.  <br />An example of how the author goes wrong is in chapter 11, where the UNIX \\"grep\\" command is covered.  The author continually refers to the \\"grep\\" command as \\"she.\\"  I suppose he thinks that personifying a UNIX command will somehow make the material more enjoyable to his \\"3rd grade readers.\\"  He couldn't be more wrong!  I find this style so annoying I want rip the pages from the book and send them mercilessly through a shredder!  <br />So, unless you like to read technical books with the words \\"dummy\\" or \\"idiot\\" in the title, I would stay away from this one.  There is no shortage of excellent UNIX books out there, so there is no reason to waste time with this one.	2004-01-16

The downside is the author's technique of trying to teach relatively simple concepts through the use of fairly complex examples.  I prefer to have a concept explained and then see a fairly simple example.  Not all of the chapters are this way.  Some of the early ones are very well done, but I found myself just skimming through some of the chapters because I don't want to read 4 pages of code to understand one concept.  <br />XSLT does have a farily verbose syntax, so the author cannot always reduce the size of the code listings.  In those cases, it would be really nice if the 3 or 4 important lines of code were highlighted in some way to assist the reader.	2002-08-13
US	52466762	R1WQ2XMYSWHDAT	156592746X	646777222	Java Server Pages (Java Series)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Well Done	This book not only covers JSP syntax and techniques, but also adds a lot of value with its discussion of web application architecture. In other words, the author does a good job of showing how JSP should fit into an overall application design. <br />The author's writing style is clear and effective and the examples are generally very good. One minor criticism is that the author uses a lot of his own custom JSP tags in examples throughout the book and I felt that this hid the details of what is really going on in some cases. The book also includes a useful reference section at the end.	2002-07-31

The quality and writing style of each chapter varies widely.  I thought the chapters on XPath, XSLT, DOM, SAX2, and SOAP were well written, but I was disappointed by some of the others.  <br />The chapter on XML Schemas was the worst, in my opinion.  This is a very important subject, but it is given the same amount of space as much less important topics.  As a result, the author of this chapter tries to cover too much in too little space and ends up being quite confusing.  Examples are thrown out followed by only partial explanations, and the author forgets to do some basic things like showing a sample XML document to match the sample XML Schemas in the examples.  If you need to understand XML Schemas, skip this chapter and go directly to &quot;Professional XML Schemas,&quot; which is very well written book on the subject.<br />This book is also too large and attempts to cover too many obscure topics.  For example, it wastes a chapter on &quot;XML Schema Alternatives&quot; when it is clear that XML Schema is the approach that will be used by almost everyone going forward.  <br />Finally, my standard complaint about all WROX books is that the font they use is too small!  I feel like I'm reading a telephone book.  Give the readers a break by taking out some of the less important chapters and increasing the font size.	2002-07-31

The author's style is very readable and he mixes in the appropriate amount of code samples to illustrate the concepts.  All code samples are very well documented, which is a big help.<br />    This is really two books in one.  First is a thorough explanation of the JavaScript language fundamentals and how to use JavaScript in web pages.  Then, comes the very complete reference sections which describe all classes and functions of core JavaScript, client-side JavaScript, and DOM programming.  As a result, this is the only book you need to both learn and use JavaScript.<br />    The author also does a nice job of pointing out which functionality will or will not work on Netscape or IE.  And, he  includes useful tips on how to work around some of these issues.  <br />    Those with experience in HTML but no programming languages may have a hard time with the level of detail in this book, but experienced programmers will appreciate the serious treatment of the JavaScript language.  Beginners who just want to learn how to do simple scripts may want to look elsewhere, but for the serious web programmer, this book is a must have.	2002-06-27

Unfortunately, the 3rd edition adds very little and takes away many of the best parts of the 2nd edition. The chapter on report formatting was completely removed in this edition. I guess we will have to call it Pel instead of Perl. (The &quot;r&quot; in the name stands for &quot;reporting,&quot; but reporting is no longer covered at all in this book).<br />The second edition also had an excellent chapter on CGI programming with Perl. This was also sent to the dumpster. Another casualty was chapter one which previously contained a well crafted introduction to the language called a &quot;stroll through Perl.&quot; It has been replaced by a boring and traditional introduction chapter. <br />So, what were the additions that warranted the creation of a new edition in the first place? The chapter on regular expressions was spilt into three chapters. A good idea, but the coverage is almost identical to that of the previous edition. A little more explanation is added in various chapters here and there, which is good. But, this edition also contains many more footnotes, which is bad! The authors seem obsessed with footnoting the most obscure and bizarre details in footnotes, and there are footnotes on almost every page. (Of course you don't have to read them, but like looking at a bad car accident, I just can't resist). <br />This is still a good tutorial on Perl, but the second edition is so much better I would recommend buying it instead of the third edition. Unfortunately, newer does not always mean better.	2002-06-27

The author gives her unique perspective on the law through stories of several cases she defended. While I found the book very interesting, especially her explanation of the Menendez case, I couldn't help thinking that she was giving only one side of the story and leaving out facts that didn't support her views of defendant's rights.

Scott Adams has an incredible ability to detect the absurd in the world of corporations and management and turn it into entertainment for the masses of cube dwellers who must endure it day after day.  I especially enjoyed his analysis of &quot;downsizing&quot; and the way management will package it in the future.  <br />The most surprising part of the book was Adams' description of the principles he would use to run a company.  They make a lot of sense and would probably help to make a company successful.	2001-01-25

That is not the case with this book.  By using characters from classic literature to illustrate leadership characteristics the authors manage to find a unique balance between substance and style that really works.  <br />The leadership lessons from the classics are still applicable today and this book gives them a fresh perspective by relating them to the modern business environment.  The authors also complement the examples from classic literature with some excellent examples of recent management approaches.  The result is terrific.	2001-01-09

If you have some understanding of Java, this book is all you will need to pass the programmer exam.  It gets into the level of detail which is necessary to be prepared for the type of questions that appear on the exam.  And, even with the high level of detail, the material is surprisingly easy to read. <br />If the book covered only the programmer exam I would have given it 5 stars, but it claims to be the &quot;Complete&quot; Java 2 Certification Study Guide and I was very disappointed with the coverage of the developer exam.  The author of that section seems very concerned about &quot;not giving away any answers.&quot;  As a result, he gives very little useful information at all.  I don't feel any more prepared for the developer exam now than I did before I read that section of the book.  <br />I will definitely have to look to other sources for preparation for the developer exam, but this book was all I needed to easily pass the programmer exam.	2000-12-02

I think there is a great demand for this approach in many areas and that is why many people have given this book 5 stars.  However, the author does a poor job of condensing the material effectively in the short space allotted.<br />The first 38 pages are a dull and useless discussion of &quot;process.&quot;  It has virtually nothing to do with UML, yet it consumes 1/4 of the book!  I expected this book to get right into UML and without a lot of fluff.  So, I was disappointed that it took so long for a &quot;distilled&quot; book to get to the point.  <br />The 100 pages which actually cover UML are good, and cover most of the areas you will need to understand the UML notation.  However, I felt there should have been more example UML diagrams to help solidify the concepts.  <br />Also, the author tends to stray into a lot of personal opinion about how he uses UML.  This is not necessarily bad, given that he has a lot of real-world experience, but it is clear that he believes &quot;his way is the best way,&quot; and I found that a little annoying.  <br />Overall, the book does fulfill its purpose, although not nearly as well as I expected.	2000-11-21

It does a great job of examining the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches various languages take.  <br />The author has an incredible amount of knowledge of many different languages which enables him to offer a unique perspective on the subject.  The book has a good balance between showing how things are done in newer languages like Java and C++ as well as older languages like Fortran and PL1.  Not only does the author tell you what is different, he explains the reasons for the differences.<br />I would say that sometimes the coverage may be too detailed for the average reader.  For example, many pages are spent describing loops, but this is something that is very similar in all languages so it should have been covered only very briefly.  <br />I particularly enjoyed the the chapter on the history of programming languages, which explained the origin of all major languages (and several minor ones) including why they were invented and what impact they have had on computer science.	2000-10-05

It is well organized and it is clear that a great deal of effort was put into identifying the best articles to include in this collection.

It is full of great information, but sometimes you will have to read a paragraph several times to fully understand it.  This is not necessarily bad, but if you prefer a more practical or conversational style you should probably find another book.  <br />The book thoroughly covers all of the fundamental concepts of object oriented design in a language-independent way.  Although there are some C++ code samples they are brief and it is not necessary for the reader to have a C++ background to learn the OO concepts presented in the book.<br />Even though there are newer books out there you still should consider this one because the concepts presented such as encapsulation and polymorphism have not changed and are well covered in this classic work.	2000-10-03

Often I felt like the book was more of an advertisement for a consulting company than a serious treatment of the issues involved in implementing an ERP system.

The early chapters build a nice example program that shows many of the commonly used elements of Perl in a practical way so that you can quickly get a grasp of how Perl works.  <br />The book is not intended to be a complete Perl reference.  For that you will probably want to get &quot;Programming Perl.&quot;  But, by not attempting to write a complete Perl reference, the authors were able to keep the focus on practical examples which help the reader get a reasonable understanding of the language without getting bogged down by too many details at once.	2000-09-20

The author covers all of the important aspects of EJB, but he does it in a  gradual way so that the reader is not overwhelmed by too much detail early  on.  He starts off with an excellent introductory chapter which explains  why you might want to use distributed programming in the first place and  gives a simple example that gives the reader a solid perspective on the big  picture.  Too many books dive right into the details without ever taking  the time to give the reader that frame of reference.<br />Some readers may  find the material a little repetitive because concepts are restated in  subsequent chapters with more detail added.  I personally liked this  approach because it helped to reinforce the concepts in my mind by hearing  many of them more than once.  <br />One small negative about the book is the  way it attempts to cover both EJB 1.1 and 1.0.  I was not interested in  learning about the old standard and I thought having it in the book  cluttered it up, and in some cases it was difficult to tell where the 1.0  discussion ended and the 1.1 discussion resumed.  <br />I think this book is  the &quot;definitive&quot; book on EJB and it should be a part of any EJB  developers library.  What really sets this author apart from others is his  ability to &quot;teach&quot; the material rather than just presenting facts  and sample code for the reader to analyze.	2000-09-13

The strength of this book is the way it focuses on how to create commonly  used web page elements.  It is excellent for beginners because it assumes  that the reader has absolutely no experience with HTML or related  technologies.  Those with HTML or related experience may find the book's  approach a bit tedious and may want to look for more of a heavyweight book.   <br />The book is not useful as a reference, in my opinion, because it does  not detail all of the possible options for the various commands.  But, it  was clearly not the author's intention to write a complete reference  manual.  For this, I would recommend &quot;HTML The Definitive Guide.&quot;   <br />The book's low price makes it an excellent value for the amount if  helpful information you will find in it--especially for beginners.	2000-09-13

It starts off with several chapters covering Servlets, then a  solid chapter on JSP, followed by coverage of JDBC, and a chapter on  database connection pools.  This would have been enough for a complete  book, but it doesn't stop there.  There is also good coverage of XML, RMI,  JNDI, EJB, and more.<br />To me, this book is an essential reference for  anyone doing server-side Java programming.  It has been an invaluable  resource on my current programming project.  I continually recommend it to  my co-workers.<br />The book has a good balance of example code and  explanations, and the authors generally have very good writing styles which  make the technical material relatively easy to understand.  However, at  times you can tell that the book has many authors because not all of the  chapters are of the same quality.  In particular, I though chapters 5 and 6  were not as well written as most of the others.<br />One minor criticism of  the book is that even though it is over 1,000 pages it is printed in a  rather small font which made it a little hard to read. I would have  preferred that one or two of the less important chapters be excluded so  that a normal font size could have been used.  <br />This book is also a great  value for the price.  Many technical books don't cover half as much  material for the same price.  I highly recommend it.	2000-08-18

This book might be O.K. for an absolute beginner, but anyone who has any programming experience of any kind should stay away. The author clearly has no idea about basic programming concepts because he sounds amazed by simple  concepts such as variables, arrays, methods, and objects.  Here are a few  examples:<br />In several places the author writes an if statement that will  always be true so that &quot;we know the condition will run.&quot;  Huh?   Obviously, if it is always true there is no need to have it!  (See page 241  if you don't believe me.)<br />Another example is the authors lack of  understanding of the concept of operator precedence.  He actually claims  that &quot;10 * 2 + 1 / 3 - 7&quot; will evaluate &quot;left to  right.&quot; (See page 142 is you think I'm joking.)<br />He also makes  utterly stupid comments like, &quot;JavaScript counts everything,&quot;  again and again throughout the book.  <br />This book is totally worthless as  a reference, but I thought it would at least have some cool scripts. Wrong!  The scripts are very basic and generally not very useful.  <br />Don't be  fooled by this book's low price either.  It's not worth it!  You will have  to buy a real JavaScript book later anyway.	2000-05-02

However, where it fails is in the title: &quot;An Introduction to ...&quot;  If it was intended to be an  introduction to automata and formal language it should have a lot more  clear explanation and none of the proofs.  This book is filled with proofs  that no one but a mathematics major could possibly understand.  And the  proofs aren't even relevant to the fundamental understanding of the  concepts.<br />It is clear that the author isn't writing this book as a  tutorial for students, but as a reference for professors.  It seems like he  is trying to show off his proof-writing ability throughout the book and has  no concern for the poor student who might be struggling to understand new  concepts.  That's why I give it a low rating.<br />I was lucky to have an  excellent instructor for this class so that after her lectures I could read  this book and understand most of it.  But, it would be almost impossible to  learn anything from this book by self study only.  So my advice, like  others who have posted is:  Unless this book is required for a class, don't  buy it!	2000-01-20

Some of the author's comments made me wonder if this book wasn't really written in the 1980's.  For example, when discussing floppy drives he recommends installing both a 3 1/2&quot; and a 5 1/4&quot; drive!  My guess is that this book is based on &quot;Build Your Own 286 PC and Save a Bundle&quot; and the word &quot;Pentium&quot; was simply substituted everywhere that &quot;286&quot; had appeared!  Also, the author's writing style is very poor which makes this book very tedious to read.	1998-05-21
