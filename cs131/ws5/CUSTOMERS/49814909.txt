Makes the \\"Amityville Horror\\" school of \\"true haunting\\" books look like children's fairy tales by comparison.

After having grown up since then I came across it and decided to re-read it. How I was naive enough to have (even as a 12 year old) believed that this was a real diary is astonishing to me now. Everything about the book screams \\"set-up\\". It's heart may be in the right place, but it's so clear that the writing was faked by an adult pretending to use be a teenage druggie that I found much of the book very funny, which was NOT it's intended effect. Furthermore,the errors in the actual descriptions of drug effects could only have been written by a non-drug user. If you can fool your pre-teen kids into believing this junk it might do some them some good. Probably not,it may just increase curiosity about drugs(which should ALWAYS be a consideration when teaching kids about drugs) as it did with me,and that does nobody any good. By the same fake author as \\"Jay's Journal\\", obviously written by the same person. Probably the so called \\"editor\\" of both books.<br /><br />  Anybody older than 14 or so will instantly smell a rat. It's much better to get a book written by a REAL ex-drug user. You can't fake the horror written there and as with anti-drug speakers,the kids can sense when they're being told the truth about this kind of thing and if they feel lied to, they'll assume that ALL of the information they get about drugs is suspect.	2005-07-24

I've learned much of the book and Mormonism's history since. The bad plot was likely borrowed from a dime store novel,it's written in a really pathetic attempt at King James English, though it was supposedly written 1400 years before King James and the spelling and grammer (written by an Angel,no less.) have had to be re-proofed many, many times. The most damning truth is that doctrines people base their lives on have appeared and disappeared with regularity in different editions, though the leadership CLAIMS this has not happened, (Much like they deny Mormonism's denial of  EXTENSIVE, heavily documented proof of Polygamy,not to mention pedophilia, and so-called \\"blood atonement\\" murders committed or sanctioned by virtually every leader of the LDS until the 1900's.)

It thoroughly refutes the poor scholarship that lead to the mistaken theory that there was a radical disparity between Calvin's view of predestintion and those of his immediate followers with most of the blame going to Calvin's hand picked succesor in Geneva: Theodore Beza. Muller, who in the years since this book was written has clearly establshed himself as THE authority on Reformed Scholasticism destroys years of biased scholarship in minutes. Anyone wanting more should investigate his four volume series on Reformed Orthodoxy, but this is the best place to start clearing away the cobwebs of fuzzy, anti-calvinist thinking that has dominated Reformed studies for the past 150 years.

By 1750 Calvinism was no longer a majority opinion in Geneva, at least, not the orthodox variety that had made Geneva synonomous with Calvinism. The ideas of the enlightenment had so thoroughly affected the Reformed movement that no conclusions can be drawn from Geneva's place as the capital of calvinism and the increase in suicides there.In fact, a very good case could be made for the opposite. Although a scion of the famous Turretin family was Geneva's leading theologian at the time, it was his watering down of his father and grandfather's calvinism that he was best known for.

The only trouble is the organizational principle: the books are listed according to their relation to the Heidelburg catechism's system, which is nowhere near as complete a summary of reformed doctrine as the Westminster Confession, which would have been a much better choice. Because of this, some books which aren't related topically are listed together. This could be troublesome to a beginner, but is a relatively small objection given the overall excellence of the annotations. Joel Beeke, a Reformed pastor, has rapidly made a name for himself as one of the best and brightest Reformed theologians of the past 100 years with this and a virtual mountain of quality reformed books that flow from his pen.

I read this wonderful book in my early years of college and it influenced my choice of major and my thesis topic (On Thomas De Quincey and the benefits of opium to his work ). Essentially a series of brief biographies outlining several famous authors from the 16th the the 19th century, and how their addictions affected their lives,relationships and creative art.<br />  The best section is on Thomas de Quincey (Author of &quot;Confessions of an English Opium Eater&quot;), who had a successful career as a freelance writer while deeply addicted. He is compared and contrasted with S.T Coleridge, who became a famous poet before aquiring his habit, which then led to his writing a handful of great opium influenced poems (&quot;Dejection: An Ode&quot;, &quot;Christabel&quot; and &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; which is rife with addictive imagery) before becoming almost totally incapacitated except as a speaker. Hayter claims ,quite convincingly ,a controversial theory that Coleridge used a very strong brand of Laudenum (called &quot;Black Drop&quot;)which was heated with ascetic acid, converting it directly into the much more addictive compound heroin!) I disagree strongly with some of Hayter's conclusions, but they are all well-documented and sensible. The best book on creativity and drug use before the rise of the drug culture in the late 20th century.	2003-11-22

The truth of the matter is that Fuller, using a popular methodology, actually introduced Arminianism into a previously orthodox denomination. Gill, as Dr. Ella shows in his book on him,&quot;John Gill and the Cause of God and Truth&quot; was not at all the &quot;hyper-calvinist&quot; of popular repute. Fuller appears orthodox because he uses orthodox terminology, but defines the terms in new ways, much like Dave Hunt and Normon Geisler in their deceptive,recently published attacks on orthodox Calvinism. Dr. Ella shows how Fuller used this tactic to introduce foreign ideas into the Baptist denomination and partially caused it's decline in orthodoxy and eventually brought about the &quot;Down Grade&quot; controversy a centry later.	2003-11-09

John Rice, who passed away a few years back, was the kind of catankerous, bad personalitied man, who's intolerence and doctrinaire fundementalism made him a living example of everything that's WRONG with his brand of emotionally stunted Christianity. Asuming, that is that one cares to give him the benefit of the doubt on whether he's even experienced saving grace. Aside from all that,this book is silly. Rice obviously hates Calvinism, but he's confused regular calvinism with the typical straw man of &quot;hyper-calvinism&quot; which he never defines. Better educated men than Rice have made this error over and over again, so it shouldn't surprise us that he does too, but anyone wanting to know about either Calvinism or Hyper-Calvinism(Assuming a book exists on the sugject, I've yet to see one based on reasearch rather than prejudice), will have to keep looking. One good thing about Rice, though, is he's so extreme and so uneducated that he's actually fun to read! This goes for all his work, especially his bizarrely funny magazine: Sword of the Lord!

For reasons that are best discussed a length elsewhere, Murray and his publisher Banner of Truth, have launched a very deceptive campaign against what they term \\"hyper-calvinism\\" under the guise of the \\"Free Offer Controversy\\". The problem is, that the people they attack, (John Gill and William Huntington amoungst others) DO NOT hold to the views that they are charged with here, and in several other current books. Part of the problem is sloppy research (relying on biased older works of men who had personal agendas against these men and weren't above outright lying) and partially redefining words that the authors attached other meanings far different than those defined by Murray and his modern compatriots. I'd strongly urge that before reading this work, you check Dr. George Ella's website ([...] in one or more of his numerous biographies or check the magazine he frequently contributes to (New Focus at [...] Spurgeon himself greatly admired Gill and kept his portrait in his ofice! Check out this quote from Spurgeon about Gill's commentaries:\\"His great work on the Holy Scriptures is prized...by the best authorities, which is conclusive evidence of it's value.\\" Writing about Gill's pastoral ordination, Spurgeon says: \\"Little did the friends (parishoners) dream what sort of man they had chosen to be their teacher, but had they known they would have rejoiced that a man of such vast erudition...indefatigable industry...sound judgement and such sterling honesty had come amoung them.\\" - quoted in \\"John Gill & the Cause of Truth\\" by George Ella, 1995.<br />  The same argument goes for virtually all the evangelists Murray misrepresents.	2003-07-31

The clarity of thought here is miles beyond anything else I've found. The format is simple: A question from the catechism, the relevant scripture passages identified and summarized in a single sentence, then a series of brief questions and answers on the passage.  The Larger Catechism of the Westminster Confession has unfortunately been rather neglected, both in churches and in the written word (Thomas Ridgely's two volume commentary is the only other I can think of, and it's much too complex for most readers) but this volume makes all the theological complexities crystal clear.

In Greene's book, he cogently demonstrates that this very charecteristic would lead the United States into a protracted war in Vietnam (the novel was written in 1955). This isn't a type that's unique to either end of the political spectrum either, John F. Kennedy was a \\"quiet American\\" on the left (most people conviniently forget that his gung-ho green beretism got us into Vietnam to start with) and Oliver North is the pefect example on the right. North's testimony made me almost physically ill. To listen to a man justify his total disregard for the principles of democracy in a naive attempt to FURTHER democracy was disgusting.

So,all in all, making such a basic error makes Geisler at least an unreliable guide to Predestination. Try Boettner's &quot;Reformed Doctrine&quot; or R.C Sproul's &quot;Chosen by God&quot;.	2002-01-27
US	49814909	RB6L5KNRWNQAJ	0873779207	318512277	A Memoir of the Life and Writings of Rev. John Gill, D.D	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Best Short Biography Of John Gill	Given the relative lack of biographical information on this great servant of God, This is certainly the best short treatment of the subject. Rippon followed Gill in his pulpit and was in a better position to know him than any other biographer to date. George Ella has a supurb long biography called &quot;John Gill and the Cause of Truth&quot; (NOT to be confused with Gill's own book &quot;The Cause of God and Truth&quot;) but it may not be easily available as it was printed in England. But, this is a must for anyone who has been blessed by the solid gopel truths of Gill.	2001-08-30

Of course, any book of this type will leave some unsatisfied ,and my own objection to it is that too much space is given to theologians and organizations which are really NOT reformed in the sense that most of us would understand it. I don't see any need for a long article on the World Council of Churches right after a long one of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. Many of the theogians selected were reformed in background alone and changed entirely in view. Still, the material on Protestant scholaticism is great and most of the major points are hit. Though a book twice the size is needed, this is certainly a fine attempt.	2001-02-28
US	49814909	R2GFZHACHJO9VA	0195007433	663649109	The History and Character of Calvinism	Books	5	22	22	N	N	Best Introduction to Date	This book has been the standard history of Calvinism since it first came out. McNeill is NOT a calvinist but I don't detect any really biased statements. The narrative is quick and moves from the start of the Swiss reformation through the impact of Calvinism on modern culture. Of course, the last section is the  least developed since it was written before the current revival of Calvinism and the rise of Reconstructionism and the &quot;reprint Puritan&quot; phenomenon. Still the best.	2001-01-20

The best feature in my opinion, however, is the wonderful annotated bibliography which accompanies it. Each theme of the confessions is aligned with the best Reformed books on each topic. Standard Reformation era and Puritan works are recommended along with the latest contributions to each field, with suggestions for begining and advanced study. A major resource that I'd love to see expanded and put into a book by itself. Note: Since I originally wrote this review, the Bibliography HAS been reissued under another seperate cover. It is not, However, expanded. Hopefully another edition will do that.	2001-01-03

Although these stories tend to be a bit longer than masterworks like &quot;Green Tea&quot;, they are every bit as worthwhile and are musts for any fan of English-Irish ghost stories. These two volumes comprise multiple collections of LeFanu's work originally published under the titles &quot;Madame Crowl's Ghost&quot; &quot;In A Glass Darkly&quot;, &quot;Golden Friars&quot; and several previously uncollected stories. Le Fanu is right behind M.R James and right in front of E.F Benson in the ghost story writing business.	2000-09-29

Readable and informative. One of the best books on the subject in print.	2000-09-26

Ames wrote the Marrow in order to take all the confusing arguments of systematic theology and boil them down to the essence, so his readers would have the BARE BONES of the point at issue. This he did magnificently! This edition has a full biography of Ames and a good writeup that gives the feel for the times and debates surround the work. A masterpiece!	2000-09-26
