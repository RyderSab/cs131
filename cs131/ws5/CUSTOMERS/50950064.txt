Truth to be told, I plan to buy this book even though I have already read it, due to the fact that it is the kind of book you just want to have. This book includes several essays and articles written by J. H. H. Weiler on European integration, from different points of view. That variety can be seen simply by reading the titles of some of the essays in this book, for example \\"The transformation of Europe\\", \\"Introduction: the reformation of European constitutionalism\\", \\"European democracy and its critics: polity and system\\" and \\"To be an European citizen: Eros and civilization\\".<br /><br />Those essays were written by the author during a period of 10 years, and were finally revised, updated (when it was necessary) and compiled in this book, released in 1999. According to Weiler, he considered rewriting all these essays into a monograph, but settled on keeping their format in order to allow the reader to choose exactly what he wanted to read, according to his interests and available time. In Weiler's own words, \\"I expect that no one will read all the essays and articles in this book- not even my own doctoral students. But I do hope that many more will read some of its essays and articles that would be the case if this were a scholarly monograph of equal size\\".<br /><br />I specially liked the fact that every chapter (that is, each individual essay) can be read as a standalone, because I think that allows everybody to choose exactly where to begin reading this book, and gives the opportunity of not reading something if the theme isn't particularly appealing. Despite that, if you start this book because you are interested in one particular chapter, it is highly likely you will end up reading at least some of the others, as the writer's engaging writing style will tempt you to go on reading. Also, and from the point of view of a non-native English speaker (my case), it is a pleasure to read something that is so well-written...<br /><br />All in all I can say that all these essays and articles are highly interesting, and allow the reader to learn something more about European integration, as a process, an ideal and a reality everybody has to deal with. In my opinion, this book somehow manages to tackle quite well both the structure and ends of European Integration, and that is no easy task. Whether you are a student or someone who is just interested in the subject, I recommend this book as great reading material that allows you to read exactly what you find interesting and at your own pace.<br /><br />Belen Alcatoint of view of a non-native English speaker (my case), it is a pleasure to read something that is so well-written...

If you already are a fan of the series, I am pretty sure you will like it a lot, as it has a good plot, fast-paced action, and continues with the development of the characters you already probably love. On the other hand, if you are new to the series, I would advise you to read it in order, instead of jumping ahead. Trust me, you will enjoy all the books more in that way.<br /><br />That having been said, what is up in this new book?. A family has been murdered during the night, and there is only one survivor, a very scared young girl, Nixie. Lieutenant Eve Dallas is primary at the scene, and she will do her best to catch the murderers. The problem is, there is no evident reason to kill the family, nothing that stands out as suspicious in the lives of Nixie's parents. But surely, they must have done something to provoke the wrath of whomever killed them in their beds, despite their high-tech security system.<br /><br />Dallas decides to take Nixie to her house, overcoming the objections of the social worker in the case, and due to the fact that the little girl doesn't want to part with her. There is a problem, though. Eve is more scared of children than of criminals, and both her and Roarke are more or less out of their depth in their dealings with Nixie. Thanksfully, they have Summerset (the \\"frog-faced demon from hell\\", according to Eve), who takes care of Nixie while the case heats ups and the murderers of her family go on killing, with an ultimate target in mind: Nixie.<br /><br />In \\"Survivor in death\\" you will meet again (if briefly) old characters of the series, as well as the regular \\"cast\\" (Eve, Roarke, Peabody, Feeney, Mavis, Summerset, Trueheart, Baxter, etc...). Something stands out rather starkly, and that is that Eve was somewhat cold towards Nixie. In my opinion, that had to do with two facts: that Nixie's ordeal made Eve remember her own, and that Eve isn't comfortable with children (do you remember \\"Ceremony in death\\"?). Both Nixie and Eve are survivors, but their past and nightmares are vastly different. Eve realizes that, and will do all in her power to protect Nixie, keeping her alive and not leaving her at the mercy of the system. Roarke is also an important character in \\"Survivor in death\\", and you will see him going to the rescue once again, and scaring the daylights out of Eve mentioning the possibility of having children \\"one day\\"...<br /><br />All in all I can say that I really liked this book. It kept me entertained, and I enjoyed it till the very last page.

This book is a perfect mix of whodunit, some romance and a futuristic cop series. But then, you probably know that, if you have read the other books in the series. If that is not the case, please do first things first, and start by the beginning, reading the series in order. Even though all the books in the \\"In death\\" series can be read independently, it is only when you read them in their correct order that you will fully enjoy the series, as you will appreciate the interrelation  between the characters and how they grow.<br /><br />In this case, Lieutenant Eve Dallas has to face crime again. She finds herself as the primary in the gruesome murder of a maid that happened in one of the hotels of her husband, Roarke, just as Eve was attending a charity party there with him. Thanks to the security cameras, Eve discovers that the murderer is nobody else than Sylvester Yost, a gun for hire for the elite, that has been in the FBI's most searched list for more than 20 years. However, one thing is to know who he is, and another one is to find him. Only a very confident assassin does not mind showing his face.<br /><br />As if that were not enough, soon afterwards another murder is committed by Yost, and in this case the victim is a young friend of Roarke. All seems to point out to the fact that someone ordered Yost to mess with Roarke, and ultimately who knows, maybe kill him. But why? And is Eve in danger too?.<br /><br />Of course, there is much more than that in this book. An old friend of Roarke, Mick Connelly, reappears, and Eve cannot help but think he might be linked to the murders, despite Roarke's trust in Mick. Also, there is trouble in paradise for Peabody and McNabb, and more than some squabbles between Eve and some FBI's officers that are also trying to catch Yost.<br /><br />On the whole, the points mentioned above help to make this a very engaging book, for those who like a good thriller with lots of action. I would like to point out, however, that the murders in this book are specially grim, so take that into account when deciding whether to buy this book. That having been said, I recommend \\"Betrayal in death\\" to you.<br /><br />Belen Alcatho like a good thriller with lots of action.

Notwithstanding that, this new series can also be read on its own, as it has more than a few different characters.<br /><br />The most important one is Daine, an orphan girl who is 13 years old and can communicate with animals, because she has \\"Wild magic\\". In this book, readers will accompany her in a dangerous journey from her old home to the palace of her king. Things won't be easy, though, and Daine will have to come to terms with her powers, if she wants to survive the many dangers she will have to face. Will Daine become a mage and face her destiny?. Or will her fear of the secret she is hiding make that something impossible?.<br /><br />The answers, of course, are in this book. I recommend it to readers older than 9, and even teens or adults that enjoy a charming and well-written fantasy epic. If you like this book check out the sequels, \\"Wolf-Speaker\\", Emperor Mage\\" and \\"The Realms of the Gods\\".<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-09-25

If you haven't read the previous book in the series, \\"Wild Magic\\", please do so because it provides you with background information regarding the characters that will be useful when you read \\"Wolf-speaker\\".<br /><br />As you already know if you are still reading this review, Daine is a 14-year-old girl with wild magic that is training to be a mage. Wild magic allows Daine to communicate with animals, and in some cases even heal them. However, and as Daine will learn in this book, she still has to discover the extent of her powers. Most readers will delight in reading the conversations between Daine and her animal friends, and laugh at her clumsiness when trying to turn into a wolf, or... a bat :)<br /><br />The plot of \\"Wolf-speaker\\" revolves around the fact that some wolves ask Daine to help them find a solution to a dangerous trouble that is threatening the place they call home. Daine is compelled to help the wolves, as they are the very same pack that helped her to find revenge against those who killed her mother. But as Daine begins her new journey, along with her teacher Numair (a powerful mage), she will realize that not everything is going well in Tortall, and that there is a new threat that could mean not only the doom of the wolves, but also of the whole kingdom of Tortall. Only by joining her strength to that of Numair and her animal and immortal friends will Daine be able to prevent the disastrous consequences of treacherous acts.<br /><br />All in all, I think that readers older than 9 will love \\"Wolf-speaker\\", and that even teens or adults that enjoy a good fantasy epic with lots of magic and adventure might appreciate it. If you like \\"Wolf-Speaker\\" check out its sequels, Emperor Mage\\" and \\"The Realms of the Gods\\".<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-09-25

This book is a compilation of all \\"Mafalda\\"'s comic strips. Who is \\"Mafalda\\", you might ask?. Well, she is a very outspoken little girl who isn't afraid to say exactly what she thinks about many subjects, including her parents, politics, ecology and her enormous distaste of soup  :)<br /><br />\\"Mafalda\\" was created by Argentine cartoonist Quino (the pseudonym of Joaquin Salvador Lavador), and has been published in Latin America, France, Greece, Italy, China and Portugal. Even though \\"Mafalda\\" first appeared in the '60s, most of the stories you will read in this book maintain their edge. A great part of \\"Mafalda\\"'s charm is that these comic strips allow us to see many matters from the point of view of a young but highly intelligent girl, who isn't old enough to know that speaking her mind isn't always the right thing to do.<br /><br />All the same, her candid but highly accurate views on many issues will make you laugh, and think. Young children, teens and adults will interpret her words differently, based on their diverse experiences. But I bet all of them will enjoy this book.<br /><br />You must take into account, though, that this book is in Spanish. That being the case, you should at least know some Spanish, or be eager to learn it (and there is no better reason to do that than wanting to read \\"Mafalda\\"!). What is more, and in case you are not ready to buy a complete edition of \\"Mafalda\\"'s comic strips, you can always find a smaller and  less expensive edition in Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I think that \\"Mafalda\\" is a treat that the English speaking readers deserve to have. The language barrier is there, but it can be broken with some effort. Truth to be told, it is worth it. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-09-25

If you haven't read the previous books in the series, please do so because then you will enjoy this one more. I want to point out, too, that some characters in Pierce's \\"Song of the Lioness\\" quartet appear here too, so if you have read it you will appreciate this book even more. Despite that, and as I already said in a previous review regarding \\"The immortals\\", this new series can also be read on its own.<br /><br />In \\"Emperor Mage\\", Daine has to accompany a delegation from Tortall to Carthak, a country that is threatening with war, and that might have been responsible for the troubles that Daine had to face in \\"Wolf-speaker\\". The delegation includes Alanna (the king's champion), Duke Gareth, and Daine's teacher Numair. As a gesture of peace, Daine is supposed to heal the emperor's cherished birds. But is that all he wants from her?. And why does her patron god give her scary new powers?. Is the badger trying to warn her that trouble is ahead?.<br /><br />The answer to those and many more questions, can be found in this book. Daine will take her young dragon Kitten with her to Carthak, and he will amuse you with his antics. Daine will also find another good companion in the form of a small monkey she rescues from being eaten, and names Zek. We will also have the pleasure of meeting again some of the immortals that appeared in the previous books, and will learn what happens when gods get really, really mad.<br /><br />On the whole, I highly recommend \\"Emperor Mage\\" as a good addition to \\"The Immortals\\" series. I believe that readers older than 10 will love his book, and that even some parents will enjoy reading it with them. Enjoy it!<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-09-25

This volume includes the first three books in David Eddings' well-known \\"The Belgariad\\" series. Those books are \\"Pawn of Prophecy\\", \\"Queen of Sorcery\\" and \\"Magician's Gambit\\", and I can sincerely said that they are excellent, so good that I still enjoy them even though I first read the series more than 12 years ago.<br /><br />\\"The Belgariad\\" brings a strange world to the readers, a world where magic is a reality that is accepted, even if it isn't overly common. Eddings somehow managed to bring to life a whole world, with different countries and plenty of political intrigue, as well as deities that take a close interest in mundane affairs.<br /><br />The main character is Garion, a very level-headed young orphan who will suddenly find himself in the midst of action when a magical stone, the Orb, is stolen. Strangely enough, our very common teenager will involuntarily become involved in a quest to retrieve it, along with his Aunt Pol, a storyteller and some very interesting characters from diverse parts of the world. The fact is, the retrieval of the Orb involves very ancient prophecies that must be fulfilled, and Garion and his companions are part of it all.<br /><br />Garion will discover that his Aunt Pol is no other than Polgara the sorceress, and that the old man who from time to time drops by and tells him stories is both his grandfather and Belgarath the sorcerer. Garion will be eager to know more, specially what he is supposed to do in the grand scheme of things. Despite that, nobody tells him a thing, the excuse being that he will learn everything when it is time to do so.<br /><br />All in all, I can tell you that I am still thankful that this series caught my eye many years ago. \\"The Belgariad\\" is pretty popular in USA, but that isn't the case in Argentina, and I could have overlooked it. Fortunately that wasn't the case, and due to that I am in the position to highly recommend \\"The Belgariad\\" to you, knowing very well what I am saying.<br /><br />Please take into account that \\"The Belgariad, Vol. 1\\" only includes the first three books in the series, so you will do well to buy it at the same time than \\"The Belgariad, Vol. 2\\", that compiles the last two books. That is likely to save you time, because as soon as you finish the first volume you will be so full of curiosity regarding the rest of the story that you will probably run to a nearby bookstore to purchase the rest of the series, if you hadn't already done so. That having been said, happy reading :)<br /><br />Belen Alcatbr />Please take into account that \\"The Belgariad, Vol. 1\\" only includes the first three books in the series, so you will do well to buy it at the same time than \\"The Belgariad, Vol. 2\\", that compiles the last two books.

This special edition compiles the first three books of \\"The Malloreon\\": \\"Guardians of the West\\", \\"King of the Murgos\\" and \\"Demon Lord of Karanda\\".<br /><br />In those books, we get to meet the characters we learn to love in \\"The Belgariad\\", and some new ones (for example, Silk will meet a young woman that is more than his match). There is plenty of adventure, magic and a lot of that quirky sense of humour so characteristic of Eddings at his best. There is also a new quest: Belgarion's son has been kidnapped by an evil sorcerer named Zandramas in order to fulfill an ancient prophecy. If Belgarion and his friends want to save him, they will need to fulfill a parallel prophecy, and vanquish Zandramas. The fate of the world as they know it is in their hands...<br /><br />Of course, and almost needless to say, I strongly advise you to read these books in order. By that, I mean reading first the five tomes of \\"The Belgariad\\" and only afterwards start the five tomes of \\"The Malloreon\\". That is the way in which these books were meant to be read, and they are strong reasons for that. Make yourself a favour, and read them books in the correct order, as you will enjoy the series even more.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend \\"The Malloreon Volume One\\". I read these books ages ago, but I still enjoy them a lot. Truth to be told, I didn't really need this special edition of the first 3 books in \\"The Malloreon\\", as I already am the proud owner of these books in their Spanish edition. All the same, I decided to buy them again in order to be able to read the series in its original language, English. Other advantages of this edition are that it isn't expensive at all, and that it doesn't take up to much space in your library. On the whole, buying \\"The Malloreon Volume One\\" is a win-win situation. Enjoy it :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-09-21

Truth to be told, these books are even better than the first three, and it is highly likely that you will find them thoroughly enjoyable.<br /><br />Despite that, a word of advice is in order: remember to read the books in \\"The Belgariad\\" series in their correct order, because only then will you fully enjoy them. That means that even if you are given \\"The Belgariad, Vol. 2\\" as a gift, you should buy \\"The Belgariad, Vol. 1\\" (that includes the first three book in the series) and read it first. It seems simple enough, but I think I must highlight the importance of that little tip.<br /><br />If you are still reading this review, it means that you have already read \\"Pawn of Prophecy\\", \\"Queen of Sorcery\\" and \\"Magician's Gambit\\". In \\"Castle of Wizardry\\" and \\"Enchanters' end-game\\", we meet once again with the same characters, but we are allowed to watch the way in which they have grown. That is specially noticeable in the case of Belgarion, who comes to terms with his destiny, and with what it implies. C'Nedra is also somewhat surprising, as the spoiled little queen becomes a general while trying to aid Belgarion's quest.<br /><br />On the whole, I can say that I highly recommend \\"The Belgariad, Vol. 2\\" to teens and adults alike, because I believe that both will find it entertaining and worthwhile reading. I think that everybody will be able to appreciate the fast-paced action and the dry humour that pervade these books.<br /><br />Of course, there is a pitfall. This fantasy epic is so engaging that after finishing it you will be left wanting for more. Fortunately, David Eddings has written a wonderful sequel, \\"The Malloreon\\", that I also recommend to you. Having said that, happy reading  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-09-21

In my opinion, those books are a fitting conclusion to the adventures of Belgarion and his friends, and will leave you eager to read more.<br /><br />Belgarion, the Child of Light, is still seeking the clues in order to know where to meet Zandramas, the Child of Darkness. Along the way, his former enemy Zakath (the Emperor of Mallorea) and some other unlikely companions will join his cause. Cyradis, the seeress of Kell will also be part of this journey, at the end of which she will have to choose between two new Childs of light and Darkness, in an event that will involve the fate of our friends but also that of the rest of the world.<br /><br />In my opinion, buying \\"The Malloreon: volume two\\" is a great idea, because it is an inexpensive and practical way of getting hold of the last two volumes in \\"The Malloreon\\" series. This volume doesn't take up too much space, but contains wonderful adventures that will keep you entertained, and laughing. On the whole, highly recommended  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS: If you are one of the many fans that already read the series but wants to buy an extra copy of their very well-read books (my case), do it, but don't forget that Eddings also has other excellent series.

Whether it was craftily calculated or wildly impulsive, it tended to leave a mess for others to clean up\\". Eve's job is to do exactly that. As a Lieutenant of the NYPD, she stands for the dead, and seeks justice for them.<br /><br />In \\"Judgment in death\\", the 12th book in J. D. Robb's futuristic \\"In Death\\" series, the victim is another cop, Taj Kohli. He was killed while working undercover in an exclusive nightclub, that casually belongs to no other than Eve's husband, Roarke. Matters complicate further when it appears than a shady and powerful character, Max Ricker, is somehow involved in detective Kohli's death. Ricker is a former associate of Roarke that nurses a grudge against him, and wants to make Roarke pay for deciding to go solo a long time ago. As if that weren't enough, Eve's investigation uncovers police corruption, and she has to decide who is to be trusted.<br /><br />I think you are likely to appreciate the fact that recurring characters of the series appear in \\"Judgment in death\\" too. I strongly advise you read these books in order, so that you will have the opportunity of getting to know the characters slowly, and of watching them grow. Of course, my favourite interactions are those between Eve and Roarke, but there are plenty of other interesting characters, like Peabody, McNab, Captain Feeney and Doctor Mira. We even have a cop from Internal Affairs with a very big crush on Eve, something that Roarke will not take well  :)<br /><br />All in all, I really liked this book. The reasons for that are many: it has lots of action, a good plot and plenty of interesting characters. Due to all that, I recommend \\"Judgment in death\\" to you.

Despite that, \\"Rapture in death\\" has all the ingredients that make this series so engaging, that is a good mystery waiting to be solved plus romance, fast-paced action and very interesting characters.<br /><br />It is the year 2058, and Lieutenant Eve Dallas is enjoying her honeymoon with Roarke, a handsome billionaire with a highly unorthodox past. Unfortunately, not  even in a resort far from Earth can Eve escape murder, as she has to deal with the death of a young man who commits suicide. The case seemed deplorable but simple enough, until once back to Earth and her job in the New York Police Department Eve realizes that there might be a connection between that death and new ones, due to the fact that all the deceased committed suicide, had virtual reality machines, and small burns in their brains.<br /><br />Along with her faithful aide Peabody, Captain Feeney and her \\"civilian expert\\" Roarke, Eve will try to find who is to blame in this mortal game where mind control is a factor that must be taken into consideration. Those who have already read the other books in the series, will be happy to know that they will meet again previous friends, for example Mavis and Nadine.<br /><br />All in all, I think that you are likely to enjoy \\"Rapture in death\\", if you can get past the scenes I talked about at the beginning of this review. In my opinion, it is worthwhile trying to do so. Finally, and in case you are new to this series, I recommend you to read the books in the correct order, instead of starting with this one, because you will enjoy each one of them even more in that case.

Truth to be told, this book fulfils the promise I found in \\"Naked in death\\", and continues to engage me, and quite certainly many more readers. J.D. Robb is the name Nora Roberts uses for the \\"In death\\" series, a strange but effective blend of whodunnit, romance and action, set in the year 2058, in New York City.<br /><br />The main character is a member of the NYPSD, Lieutenant Eve Dallas. \\"A decade as a cop had toughened her, given her a cold, and often cynical eye toward death and its many causes. It made scenes such as the one she viewed now, on a rainy night on a dark street nasty with litter, almost too usual. But still, she felt\\". Eve's business is murder, but she cannot help identifying with the victims of a new lunatic loose in her city, someone who preys on successful women.<br /><br />Eve is also a person with a troubled past, who overcame extremely difficult circumstances and became an excellent good cop. She is also someone beginning a relationship with the most unlikely person for her: Roarke, a handsome billionaire with a shady past. In \\"Naked in death\\" we saw the beginnings of their relationship, and in \\"Glory in death\\" we are allowed to see its development. Of course, that happens amid of murder... Unfortunately for both Eve and Roarke, the victims are once again persons that Roarke knew, and that strains their relationship to the point that ending it will become a very real possibility.<br /><br />On the whole, I highly recommend \\"Glory in death\\" as a worthy addition to the \\"In death\\" series. Enjoy it!!.<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-09-04

Eve wasn't sure how it had happened in the first place".	\\"Getting married was murder. Eve wasn't sure how it had happened in the first place. She was a cop, for God's sake\\". Those are the first phrases of \\"Immortal in death\\", the 3rd book in the \\"In death\\" series. That should give you a good clue of what is going to happen in this book, namely that police officer Eve Dallas is going to marry, and to nobody else than Roarke!<br /><br />If you have read the previous books in the series, something I recommend you to do in order to fully enjoy this one, you will know that Eve is still a little confused with the fact that she fall in love, and with a billionaire no less. Roarke, on the other hand, knows exactly what he wants: Eve. And he got her agreement to marry him in a very unorthodox way, in the most unlikely situation (do you remember the last pages of \\"Glory in death\\"?). Now, there is a wedding to plan, and a wedding gown to buy. Of course, Eve couldn't be moodier, because she would rather fight a criminal than go shopping :)<br /><br />Thankfully for her, the crime of a supermodel in which both her best friend Mavis and her wedding fashion designer Leonardo are involved will keep her mind busy, as she tries to find the true culprits and acquit her friend Mavis and Leonardo, Mavis'new lover and previous boyfriend of the dead supermodel, Pandora. In the course of Eve's investigation, she will discover that Pandora's death may be just the tip of the iceberg, as she was involved in shady dealing involving a new and dangerous youth drug.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is probably one of J. D. Robb's best books in her futuristic \\"In death\\" series. The mystery behind Pandora's crime isn't easily solved, so you won't be able to stop reading this book until the very last page. Also, the relationship between Eve and Roarke is developed, and you will learn more about their troubled pasts. And finally, some eccentric new characters that we will see again in future books are introduced, so pay attention to them. On the whole, \\"Immortal in death\\" is the kind of book you should buy, read and keep. Enjoy it !!<br /><br />Belen Alcatrtal in death\\" is the kind of book you should buy, read and keep.

If you can, read the books in order, because then you will enjoy them even more. Even better, before reading \\"Bitten\\" visit the author's website and read the 3 free prequels to the series, \\"Savage\\", \\"Ascension\\" and \\"Beginnings\\". I can guarantee you that they are excellent, and the fact that you don't have to pay for them is a great added benefit :)<br /><br />Elena Micheals, the only female werewolf in the world, is again the narrator in \\"Stolen\\". That means that we are told of everything that is happening from her sometimes ironic but always funny point of view. She is working on her relationship with her boyfriend Clay, another werewolf. Of course Jeremy, the pack leader, is also present in this new adventure, but... all of them will have to keep an open mind, because it seems that there are some things/people that they didn't know about out there.<br /><br />Hmmm... what about some witches, wizards, shamans and even some vampires?. An what if you add to this already dangerous mix some half-demons, and a billionaire intent on creating a zoo of supernaturals, whether they are willing or not?. The results are explosive, especially when Elena is one of the supernaturals stolen...<br /><br />On the whole, I think that you are highly likely to enjoy this book, if you appreciate an original story that blends action, some horror, lots of magic and a bit of romance. Moreover, \\"Stolen\\" introduces us to Paige Winterbourne, a white witch who will be the narrator of Armstrong's next two books in the series, and who plays a role in rescuing Elena. What else can I say?. Find a comfortable sofa, start to read \\"Stolen\\", and enjoy the show  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-08-28

Lieutenant Eve Dallas had them all"	J. D. Robb is the pseudonym Nora Roberts uses for her futuristic \\"In death\\" series, set in the year 2058. Many things have changed, but other stay the same. There are criminals, and those who fight against them. Eve Dallas is one of those who try to uphold justice. \\"Vengeance in death\\", the 6th book in the series, starts by stating that \\"The business of murder took time, patience, skill, and a tolerance for the monotonous. Lieutenant Eve Dallas had them all\\".<br /><br />In this book, we will see Eve applying those skills to the solution of some crimes that strike close to her. Victims previously connected to her husband Roarke start to appear gruesomely murdered, and there are clues that tie their deaths to a vengeance carried out long ago by Roarke, in Ireland. When someone tries to frame Roarke's butler Somerset as the murderer, Eve knows for certain that something is afoot. The question is what, and why?.<br /><br />In my opinion, \\"Vengeance in death\\" is a book well-worth reading, even though it isn't the best in the series. You will enjoy trying to discover the mystery behind the murders, and learning more about Roarke and Somerset's past. The interaction between Ian McNabb (from the Electronic Detective Division) with Eve's faithful sideckick, Officer Delia Peabody, will draw sparks and make the reader smile and wonder about them. All in all, I think that you will like this book, specially if you have already read the previous books in the series. Happy reading  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-08-28

This young orphan starts a search for a grandfather she didn't know, and has to travel long distances, learning to survive without her family. Will she find a new one?. Well, that's precisely the point of reading this book  :)<br /><br />On the whole, I think this is an excellent book, and I believe it is a pity that it isn't more well-known in the United States. I read \\"Nobody's girl\\" a long time ago, and I simply loved it. I believe your kids will like it immensely too...<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-08-27

Books	5	1	2	N	N	Strange and funny story of a makeover  :)	This book might be just the right thing to buy for your kids while they are waiting for the next Harry Potter book to be released. It has magic, and a weird plot, but it is full of innocence and good fun. I really think that \\"Which witch\\" will engage the attention of even the most active kid, and who knows, maybe even that of an adult who is tired to death of \\"serious things\\" and needs a respite.<br /><br />The plot is simple. Arriman the Awful, a powerful evil wizard, has to marry. Unfortunately, he isn't in love, but he is all the same aware of the fact that he needs to have kids to prolong his legacy of terror. The solution Arriman finds is quite brilliant: he organizes a contest in evil witchcraft, the prize for the winner being his hand in marriage. Of course, the local witches are extremely happy with the news, and begin to prepare for the competition. One of them, Belladona, is in fact profoundly in love with Arriman, and would do almost anything to marry him. There is a little problem, though: Belladona is a white witch  :)<br /><br />I think that I have already given you enough details to have an idea of what this book is about. All in all, I believe that this book is excellent, and that your kids (and maybe you?) are highly likely to have enormous fun with the antics of Belladona and her friends in their struggle to turn her into a black witch. Read it, and enjoy!!<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-08-25

This book is a highly useful tool that can help you to understand the multilateral system of commerce as it is nowadays. Its author, Jos'&eacute; Luis P'&eacute;rez Gabilondo, is an Argentinian diplomat that works on issues related to economic multilateral issues. He is also a professor, and wrote this book for his students, in order to be able to offer them a text in Spanish about the increasingly important subject of economic controversies in the Multilateral System of Commerce.<br /><br />This \\"Manual Sobre Soluci&oacute;n de controversias en la O.M.C.\\" is divided in four parts. The first is a general introduction about the Multilateral System of Commerce. The second part tackles the system for the solution of controversies, and the third part deals with some basic principles of the Multilateral System of Commerce (and what to do when there is conflict between them). Finally, in the last part the author analyzes some Argentinian cases, and how they were solved.<br /><br />All in all, I think that this book will help students, or anybody who is just interested in the subject, to understand at least the basics of the subject at hand: that is, the solution of controversies in the World Trade Organization. In the words of the author, \\"(...) es dif&iacute;cil pensar cualquier esquema de inserci'&oacute;n econ'&oacute;mico comercial internacional sin tener presente el conjunto de derechos y obligaciones aceptados por los integrantes del sistema multilateral de comercio, plasmados en el paquete de normas de Derecho Internacional P'&uacute;lico que dieron nacimiento a la OMC\\".

Despite the fact that it isn't overly long, it tackles difficult subjects such as the nature of friendship and art in a rather original way.<br /><br />The plot is not complicated, and revolves around three male friends: Serge, Marc and Yvan. The dynamics of their friendship is substantially altered when one of them, Serge, buys a Modernist painting without consulting with the others. Serge simply fell in love with the painting, and believes it is splendid even though it is somewhat strange, all white with some lines in a different tonality of white in the middle. Marc, his assertive friend, finds that the amount Serge paid for the painting (200,000 French francs) is absurdly large, and is offended by the mere idea that his friend Serge likes it and believes it is art. Yvan, on the other hand, doesn't mind, but his non-commital attitude will land him in trouble with both Serge and Marc.<br /><br />Buying a painting, a seemingly common act, will draw the three friends into an uncomfortable debate about themselves, their relationship, and art. It will also give the reader the opportunity to take his own position in a debate that it is still going own.<br /><br />All in all, I really liked \\"Art\\", and I found the ending specially good. This is the first play by Reza that I have read, but if the rest are as good as this one, I have no doubts that I will read many more.<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-07-18

I think buying it is a good idea for:<br /><br />a- those who want to give their kids/friends (or even themselves) a great gift at a very good price --> due to the fact that you will give 5 books at the price that some bookstores sell one.<br /><br />b- those who are very lazy --> because it is almost certain that if you buy the first book for yourself or your children, you will end up at the same bookstore buying the other books in the series. Buying the first 5 books at the same time will save you time and money, and you will only have to return later to buy book number 6.<br /><br />c- those who want to read a book that their kids will love, but that they will like to, and turn the fact that they are reading the series into a family experience.<br /><br />d- those who want to motivate their children to read --> because reading Harry Potter will make them understand that there are books can offer them some things that the television cannot. If your children just hate the idea of reading, show them one of the movies based on the series, and afterwards tell them that the books have a lot to do with them, but that they are way better.<br /><br />e- those who are learning English, and want to practise it in a entertaining way. And what better way to improve your grammar that reading something that is actually fun?.<br /><br />f- those who aren't from an English speaking country, already have the books but want to read them in the language Rowlings wrote them --> because the reading experience is totally different (and yes, I know because I read some of the books both in Spanish, Italian and English).<br /><br />g- those who are curious about the series but haven't given it a try --> because this series really grows on you, and it gets better and better, specially after book number 3.<br /><br />After telling you about all the reasons why buying this boxset is a good idea, I would like to talk a little more about point g- because that was my case some years ago, even though I wasn't lucky enough to get my hands on a boxset. First, though, I would like to comment upon the fact that I know very few people who haven't liked the first book, and that have given up after a few chapters. I don't know anybody that has given up after reading the first 3 books. Yes, the first 2 books are very simple and short, but they help to set up the parallel world J.K. Rowlings is writing about. The 3rd book already shows a great promise of how the series are going to be like.<br /><br />In my case, I bought the first 4 books at the same time, a Saturday afternoon. I read the first 2 books (\\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" and \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\") rather quickly, and wondered why everybody including my sister loved them so much. They weren't long, and they were rather good, but nothing out of the ordinary. It is only while I was reading the 3rd book (\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\"), that very same night, that I understood what the hype was all about. Even though when I finished it it was high time to go to bed, I couldn't help but starting the 4th book (\\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\"), even though I was tired, and it really was much bigger than the others. It also was much more entertaining, and noticeably more complicated. Understandably (for those who have read these books, at least), I started reading it and couldn't stop until Sunday's afternoon. I was tired, but very happy of having discovered the magic, something I wouldn't have done if I had stopped after reading the first two books...<br /><br />From that point onwards, I'm a \\"pottermaniac\\". I've read all the books in the series, and I thoroughly enjoy them. Yes, I like other kinds of books too, and I'm an adult with a degree in Political Science, but that doesn't mean that I cannot find these books engaging. One of the wonderful things about the Harry Potter series is that very diverse people can like it, for very different reasons. Despite that, all readers share something special, the ability to share the magic. Be one of us, and have fun :)<br /><br />Belen Alcatr very different reasons.

I literally battled rain and cold weather with my sister to get our copies at 12.15 am, July 16, in a local bookstore in Argentina. According to my dad, I'm slightly nuts for doing that :)<br /><br />In my opinion, though, this book was well-worth the extra effort. After picking it up, I returned to my house and started to read it. I just finished it, and I can sincerely say that it is simply outstandingly good. Yes, the other books were awesome too, specially the 4th and the 5th, but I think that Harry's world is becoming more defined with each book, and that makes for a thoroughly engaging reading experience.<br /><br />What is new in this book?. Well, after having to come to face with the fact that Lord Voldemort is alive, the wizard community is in an uproar, and quite frightened. Cornelius Fudge has been sacked as Minister of Magic, and an Auror has been named in that position. Harry, Ron and Hermione get their O.W.Ls (Ordinary Wizardry Levels), and have to decide what courses to take for their N.E.W.Ts (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), something that will define their future careers. Plots abound, and danger is omnipresent throughout the book. There is a new teacher of Defense against the Dark Arts, and also an eccentric new Potions' teacher. Of course, there is much more, including a death that I bet will make you cry, and that hurts Harry enormously. I won't tell you who dies, only that the event involves the Half-Blood Prince, and that I think it was a sacrifice rather than a murder.<br /><br />But what's the point of telling you all this if you can read the book, and enjoy it as much as I did?. Suffice it to say that this is a worthy addition to the Harry Potter series. There is adventure, some romance, and many more elements that add up to make the kind of book that you simply must read. And now, after staying up all night in order to read this book, I really need to catch up on my sleep. If you haven't guessed my opinion on \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" yet, I'll say that I highly recommend it.

The person who wrote this in the preface to \\"Bush Hat, Black Tie: Adventures of a Foreign Service Officer\\" is the author of the book himself, Howard R. Simpson (1925-1999).<br /><br />The author is a person I would have like to know, because he led a very interesting life, seemed to possess a good sense of humour, and managed not to take himself too seriously while being extremely professional about his job, being a diplomat. Simpson didn't plan to be a diplomat, \\"it just happened\\". Before that, he participated in the Second World War, studied art in Paris, and became a journalist. He could have been many things, but he ended up being a diplomat, although a rather peculiar one.<br /><br />The beginning of Simpson's career can be traced to 1951, when he joined the Foreign Service as an information specialist. Simpson would be posted to French Indochina, Nigeria, France, South Vietnam, Australia and Algeria. He would also work in the United States, specifically in Washington and as a professor in the U.S. Naval War College. This book includes interesting photographs that show the author in some of those places, and that emphasize the fact that in his career he wore a bush hat at least as frequently as a black tie. My favorite photograph is probably one that shows the author in Hanoi, in 1954, when he was posing as a Polish journalist in order to escape unharmed from the communist occupied city.<br /><br />In this book, Simpon shares with the reader some of the experiences he had in the somewhat strange life that some diplomats live. He does that in an engaging way, peppering serious observation regarding policy matters with funny anecdotes. A good example of that can be found in the chapter \\"Fire ant fandango\\", where he talks about the last stages of decolonization in Nigeria, but also tells us what happens when African fire ants are surprise visitors to a reception.<br /><br />It is easy to see in every page of this book that Simpson loved his career, even though he wasn't much of a fan of paperwork. In his words, \\"I believe most Foreign Service veterans would agree that few other professions offer such a variety of interesting, adventurous, and -at times- dangerous assignments. My only advice to those now entering the ranks would be: beware of creeping bureacracy, don't take yourself  too seriously, and enjoy your new career\\".<br /><br />On the whole, I highly recommend \\"Bush Hat, Black Tie: Adventures of a Foreign Service Officer\\". It doesn't matter if you are just a reader looking to be entertained, or a person who is seriously considering joining the Foreign Service. I'm pretty sure that both kinds of reader will find what they are looking for in this book.<br /><br />Belen Alcatants are surprise visitors to a reception.

Do you love learning Portuguese but HATE the awful task of mastering verbs in a foreign language?. Me too...<br /><br />What can we do?. Which are our options?. Well, we really don't have much choice. It is either learn those annoying and somehow distressing verbs, or face the dire fate of never learning to speak Portuguese well. Can you imagine yourself in a situation inspired in the classical \\"Me Tarzan, you Jane\\"?. I bet your answer is no, if you can avoid it.<br /><br />So the real question is not whether you will learn Portuguese verbs, but how to make the whole verb learning experience less traumatic. This book is, in my opinion, a good answer to that question. Yes, it is neither original nor overly engaging, but it is very useful. It has 501 Portuguese verbs, fully conjugated in all tenses, and even samples of how each verb is used in everyday conversation. The only reason why I don't give it five stars is because it doesn't explain too well the grammatical conjugation rules, even though it mentions them. All the same, I think that wasn't the aim of the book, and that if you cannot avoid having to learn verbs (and nobody who really wants to speak Portuguese well can), you should tackle the task with some good tools. I recommend this one  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-05-30

Moreover, it is quite engaging, due to the fact that the authors combine practical advice with funny anecdotes about women working in international business.<br /><br />I recommend you to read the whole book, if you can, because at least some of the tips it gives might help to you. On the other hand, if you are pressed for time, just read the parts that interest you more. The book is neatly divided into chapters according to subjects:<br /><br />-Part one: Survival \\"over there\\"  (it includes -> 1: Sex, dating, discrimination and harassment; 2: Know your product, know the culture; 3: Protocol for women; 4: Safety when traveling; 5:Healthy traveling; 6: Luggage and packing; chapters 1 to 6).<br />-Part two: Advice country by country (it analyzes some countries in particular, but most are grouped and studied by regions; chapters 7 to 22).<br />-Part three: Women in the world of work (it includes -> 23: Women in international business: past, present and future; 24: How I got my first job in international business; 25: Profiles of three successful women; chapters 23 to 25).<br />-Part four: The international assignment (it includes -> 26: To go or not to go; 27: Preparing for your life abroad; 28: Family matters; 29: On-the-job challenges; 30: Culture shock; 31: Repatriation and reverse culture shock; 32: Cross-cultural and language training; chapters 26 to 32).<br />-Part five: Help for the independent businesswoman who wishes to work abroad (it includes -> 33: Tips for the independent career search).<br />-Part six: Additional resources.<br /><br />Personally, I found some chapters more practical than others, for instance I took great advantage of the tips on what to pack (\\"You don't need more clothes, more colors, more combinations. You need fewer things, carefully chosen\\"), but I guess that depends on what each of us needs more.<br /><br />On the other hand, bear in mind that even though the advice that the writers give is right on the spot in most occasions, that is not always the case. For example, they point out that punctuality isn't overly important in Latin American countries, but I'm from Argentina and I can say that many think that arriving late is rude, so if you were to arrive late to a business meeting just to \\"follow local custom\\", you would be giving a bad impression.<br /><br />Notwithstanding that, I can tell you that I really liked this book. I specially enjoyed the fact that the authors take into account that \\"international business tends to be uncomfortable for most North American managers -men as well as women.

For example, they point out that punctuality isn't overly important in Latin American countries, but I'm from Argentina and I can say that many think that arriving late is rude, so if you were to arrive late to a business meeting just to \\"follow local custom\\", you would be giving a bad impression.     Notwithstanding that, I can tell you that I really liked this book. I specially enjoyed the fact that the authors take into account that \\"international business tends to be uncomfortable for most North American managers -men as well as women.

All that happens is in direct relation to a secret, Eunice Parchman's secret.<br /><br />Eunice, the housekeeper of the Coverdale family, seems to be merely a dull woman with an insipid personality. She is cold and quite solemn, but not violent, at least she doesn't seem to be. However, events would prove otherwise, as the reader is informed from the very first page of \\"A judgement in stone\\": \\"Eunice Parchman killed the Coverdale family because she could not read or write\\".<br /><br />This is the story of how an apparently normal person is ridden by the all-powering obsession of protecting a secret she deems shameful, that she is illiterate. How far will she go to avoid the disclosure of that fact is something you will learn if you read this book, although you already have a pretty important clue...<br /><br />On the whole, I can say that I highly recommend this book. The main character isn't likeable (\\"A stone that breathed was Eunice, as she had always been\\"), but the story is engaging and well-written. Moreover, the writer managed to write a convincing psychological study of Eunice that allows the reader to look into the mind of a cold-blooded killer. Those are the main reasons why you won't be able to stop reading this book once you start it  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-04-29

Thomas Hobbes (1588 - 1679) was born in England, a country that endured great political turmoil during his life. Having lived through that, Hobbes' main aim was to inquire into the basis of order. The question he asked himself was \\"What kind of political authority will prevent the return of chaos?\\". And the answer to that question is in this book, \\"Leviathan\\" (1651).<br /><br />The Levianthan is the personification of total power, an authority without limits, created by men who realise that absolute power given to a powerfull ruler (or to an assembly) is their only way out of the dangers of the state of nature.  The name that the author chose for his monarch is quite telling: the Leviathan is a sea monster that appears in the Bible and symbolizes power. This kind of monarch seems like an extreme solution for the problem of anarchy, but it is the only one that Hobbes found. Without the Leviathan, life is 'solitary, nasty, brutish, and short.'<br /><br />Of course, this book includes many more things than those I have already mentioned. For instance, it explains quite well Hobbes opinion regarding human nature (man is naturally a wolf to men), the state of nature (perpetual war of all against all), the origin of political institutions and the relationship between reason and force (pacts without swords are merely words), among other things.<br /><br />On the whole, I think this book is a classic of Political Philosophy, and I recommend it as such. Despite that, I think a word of caution is in order, so you will be prepared for what you will find when you tackle \\"Leviathan\\". Truth to be told, sometimes Hobbes' prose is too dry, and in some chapters you will need to plod through some rather arid pages. Moreover, this book isn't written in modern English, what makes it more difficult to understand. Those are the reasons why I give this book four stars instead of five...<br /><br />Notwithstanding that, I believe that \\"Leviathan\\" is well-worth the effort of reading it, simply because it has some interesting concepts that you should be aware of, even if you don't agree with them. The only way to discuss in a level play field with someone who has totally different ideas is to understand his arguments thoroughly, even if his position seems completely  strange to you. I invite you to do that with Hobbes, reading \\"Leviathan\\".<br /><br />Belen Alcating concepts that you should be aware of, even if you don't agree with them.

I liked it, and I enjoyed the style in which it was written. All in all, I can honestly said that I have never read something like it  :)<br /><br />Do you want some clues about why on earth I say that?. Well, I suppose I could start by telling you something about the plot. The main character is Caffrey Quark, a young man who sells exotic meat, and looks for unusual specimens all throughout the galaxy. Truth to be told, that business isn't an easy one:  \\"The exotic meat collecting business relied on place and time. It relied on punctuality, and an encyclopedic knowledge of galactic fauna and their individual mating, scavenging, migrating, hibernating, hunting and dying habits. But perhaps more importantly, success in the business relied upon the planet containing the exotic edible to have the decency to be there when one arrived\\". That kind of job can be tiring after a while, specially for a sensitive man like Caffrey, who eventually decides he cannot go on killing \\"miracles of diversity\\", and decides to retire.<br /><br />Caffrey doesn't know exactly what he is going to do, but destiny has something prepared for him... As he is travelling in his spaceship, \\"The Moby Dick\\", he finds an old box with Earth music, including  \\"The Rollings Stones\\"'s \\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"Stairway to heaven\\" by Led Zeppelin. When Caffrey listens to those songs he receives a great shock, due to the fact that the music he knew was pretty boring, and nowhere nearly as good as that. Caffrey becomes obsessed with finding more of the music that has \\"kick-started his soul\\", and as a result ends up selling his spaceship and buying a transport with a \\"temporal  twist engine\\" that takes him to the \\"original\\" Earth, in the past, \\"in a time where its future still held potential\\". There he goes to many live shows of Led Zeppelin, the Beatles, Yes and Genesis, among others, but also forms a rock band named \\"Marmalade skies\\".<br /><br />Things were going too well to last, though, and soon enough people from his previous life will meddle in his new one, kidnapping his four bandmates, and forcing him in a quest for \\"L'Orange\\", the most important substance in the universe. Caffrey, a more or less normal man in bizarre circumstances, will be accompanied in his quest by Poe 33 (a robot who was supposed to take care of \\"L'Orange\\", but that seemingly lost it), his recovered spaceship,Angie (a very disgruntled main computer), a dog that is not a dog and Violet.<br /><br />Why is Caffrey's quest important?. Simply because \\"L'Orange\\" can shape the universe, and there are people who want to shape one without music. As our unlikely hero understand that he goes from someone who says \\"I wish I understood my role in this little soap opera\\" to a person willing to do almost everything to save a world that has a place for the music he loves so much.<br /><br />On the whole, I think that if you like science fiction and rock music, you will really appreciate \\"Milky way Marmalade\\", an unusual combination of both.<br /><br />Belen Alcat/>Things were going too well to last, though, and soon enough people from his previous life will meddle in his new one, kidnapping his four bandmates, and forcing him in a quest for \\"L'Orange\\", the most important substance in the universe.

Norberto Bobbio (1909 - 2004) was a very well-known political philosopher that delved into a lot of subjects, and led a very interesting life. \\"Left and Right : The Significance of a Political Distinction\\" is one of the many books Bobbio wrote. Truth to be told, I have many of those books, and this isn't my favourite: that honor belongs to \\"Teor&iacute;a de las Formas de Gobierno en la historia\\".<br /><br />Despite that, I like this book a lot. The reason is simple: it throws light on a very important issue, the difference between left and right. Basically, Bobbio points out that that distinction is still valid, and that it is possible to understand it through an analysis of politics, made taking into account two fundamental axis, equality and inequality, liberty and authority.<br /><br />Thanks to those two axis we can divide the different political groups into five categories (extreme left, moderate left, center, moderate right, and extreme right), and understand how the concepts of left and right change. Bobbio says that those concepts vary depending on time and place, but that there is something that is more or less permanent: attitudes regarding equality and inequality. Those in the left think that inequality can (and should) be avoided, whereas those in the right consider inequality normal.<br /><br />On the whole, I think that this book will be useful to you, due to the fact that it explains the basic differences between left and right quite well, and gives valuable examples. That is the reason why I highly recommend it to you...<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-04-21

At first sight, it appears to be the epitome of the classical comedy of mistakes. Despite that, this short play also deals with a topic that was highly controversial during Moli&egrave;re's life, women's education. The author of this book seamlessly incorporates that theme into the plot, making the reader reflect on it even without realizing he is doing that.<br /><br />To start with, I would like to outline the plot of  \\"L' &eacute;cole des femmes\\". It is simple, but shows that a play doesn't need to be too complicated in order to entertain. The main character is Arnolphe, an old man who having had lots of affairs with married women, distrust women in general. The strange thing is that in spite of that Arnolphe still wants to get married, provided (of course) that he can find a woman he can trust with his honour. After much pondering, he finds a seemingly perfect solution for his problem: to marry a woman without too much education, so she won't know how to deceive him (\\"&Eacute;pouser une sotte est pour n'etre point sot\\"). According to Arnolphe, a dumb woman is a honest woman.<br /><br />Having arrived to that conclusion, he decides to take a young orphan, Agn&egrave;s, under his wing. Arnolphe educates Agn&egrave;s according to his ideas: not too much studying, a lot of sewing and praying. The years go by, and Agn&egrave;s grows into a beautiful but profoundly ignorant young woman. Arnolphe is ready to marry her, but something unexpected happens: a new character appears. That character is Horace, a young and handsome man who falls madly in love with Agn&egrave;s and begins to court her, to Arnolphe's desperation and Agn&egrave;s' happiness.<br /><br />What will happen?. Well, you need to read \\"L' &eacute;cole des femmes\\" in order to know that. What I can tell you, though, is that I really enjoyed reading this play, notwithstanding the fact that there were some words that are no longer used in modern French. That made reading this play a little bit more difficult, although there was an abundance of footpages that explain the meaning of those words perfectly well, something that clarified my doubts.  What is more, this edition includes a chronology of Moli&egrave;re's life, and several interesting studies regarding this play, something that helps to reader to understand \\"L' &eacute;cole des femmes\\", and the context in which it was written.<br /><br />On the whole, I think that \\"L' &eacute;cole des femmes\\" is worth the time and effort of reading it. Moli&egrave;re wrote a perfectly good comedy, but he also took a stand regarding what kind of education should be given to women. He did that throughout the story, and also in a phrase said by one of the secondary characters, who says that \\"Une femme d'esprit peut trahir son devoir; mais il faut, pour le moins, qu'elle ose le vouloir; et la stupide au sien peut manquer d`ordinaire sans en avoir l`envie, et sans penser le faire\\". I completely agree with that, and I recommend this book as a play to enjoy, but also as a message to ponder...<br /><br />Belen Alcatlt, although there was an abundance of footpages that explain the meaning of those words perfectly well, something that clarified my doubts.

I don't think so.  In my opinion, Lowe's book is a great way to start studying history, or even to learn more if you have already started.<br /><br />The reasons for that statement are many. \\"Mastering Modern World History\\" is clear but doesn't oversimplify the events it talks about. It isn't long, but it gives you a brief summary of the subjects under study and the motivation to investigate more. Also, I would like to point out that the author includes at the end of each chapter some interesting questions that are eerily similar to those a teacher might ask in an exam. If you are a student, don't panic: take advantage of this opportunity :)<br /><br />\\"Mastering Modern World History\\" has many interesting illustrations, and also quite a few useful maps. This third edition includes relatively new historical events, for example the collapse of communism. All the same, I wish I could have the 4th edition, that unfortunately hasn't been published yet, because many relevant things have happened since 1997 and I would like to read about them here. That is the only reason I give this book 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />To sum up, I think this is a wonderful book, and as such a great gift to yourself and others. Lowe manages to write clearly about subjects that are not simple, and surprisingly enough for those who aren't fond of history books, he also happens to write quite well. What else can I say?. Strongly recommended!.<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-03-08

For this gull, though, it was not eating that mattered, but flight.\\" That is what the author of this book says about the \\"hero\\" of this story, a seagull named Jonathan Livingston Seagull.<br /><br />Jonathan Livingston Seagull is different to the other gulls in his flock. He doesn't live to eat, but eats to live and pursue his passion: flight. But his search for perfection and speed doesn't endear him to the other seagulls, that eventually expel him from the flock for daring to be different. To know what happens afterwards, you will need to read this book, because I don't want to spoil the ending.<br /><br />The real question here, I guess, is whether you want to read a story about gulls... I mean, there are so many good books out there, why read a book about a bird?. The answer is simple: the story in \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" is a metaphor about things that can happen to you in real life. Have you ever felt tempted to do the same that everybody else, just for the sake of conformism?. Have you often felt like given up when something you really want to do demands too much work?. Just think about it...<br /><br />I believe that many of us are sometimes like most of the gulls in this book, and we need to learn the lessons that \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" gives us: the most important thing is to believe in ourselves, and always do our best without giving up.<br /><br />I would like to point out that some people say that this book is full of New Age ideas. I really don't think so. Okay, I certainly don't know much about those ideas, and I'm not interested enough to learn more about them. But in my opinion, we often find in a book what we want to find in it.<br /><br />For me, this is only a charming allegory with a very pertinent message: DON'T ABANDON YOUR DREAMS... For that reason, I recommend this book to you. And whether you read \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" (English edition) or \\"Juan Salvador Gaviota\\" (Spanish edition), enjoy it !!!<br /><br />Belen Alcater you read \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" (English edition) or \\"Juan Salvador Gaviota\\" (Spanish edition), enjoy it !!!

Which paintings are more beautiful?. Interesting questions, but very difficult to answer unless you have at least some notions of the subject, and then, of course, a lot depends on your taste.<br /><br />This book is a first introduction to the matter, but not much more. \\"Pintura Argentina\\" allows you to have at least a glimpse of the paintings made by some Argentinian artists in the period that goes from 1830 to 1970. It includes good illustrations in colors, and three introductory essays in Spanish that will give you some details regarding the artists discussed and their historical circumstances. Some of those artists are C&aacute;ndido L&oacute;pez, Eduardo S&iacute;vori, Ernesto de la C&aacute;rcova, Fernando Fader, Ces&aacute;reo Quir&oacute;s, Xul Solar and Antonio Berni.<br /><br />This book is short, and includes only some Argentinian artists, certainly not all of them. Moreover, each artist is represented only by one or two of his paintings, something that isn't totally fair given that most have changed their style through the years. For example, \\"Jefa\\"  and \\"Vuel Vila\\" represent Xul Solar's paintings, but if you visit [...] you will realize how varied his paintings were. One of my two favorites paintings by Xul Solar, \\"Puerto Azul\\", is not included in this book but can be admired in that website. The other is in fact included in \\"Pintura Argentina\\", and it is \\"Vuel Vila\\", so please pay attention to it :)<br /><br />As you see, this book isn't enough by far if you are really interested in the subject, but it is a good way to start studying it, specially considering that until now Amazon doesn't have many more books on the subject. All in all, and until that changes, I recommend you to read this book. Be aware, though, that there is much more out there about Argentinian painters, and that you should try to discover it...<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-02-22

Despite that, I highly recommend it to you... Why?. Well, the reason is simple. The plot of \\"The Plague\\" is merely a way of understanding something that has to do with our everyday life, and the way we live it.<br /><br />Succinctly, the story begins when a plague strikes the North-African town of Oran. People at first try to ignore the clues that show that something bad is happening. When they cannot help but recognize that things are seriously wrong, a quarantine is declared. For those inside the walls of Oran, reality changes: death is omnipresent, and loneliness and despair, feelings they must confront. Different people react in diverse ways to the same reality, and we get to know about them through the narrator of this book, that also happens to be one of the protagonists. The real question that most of the persons in Oran ask themselves sooner or later is whether is it worthwhile to fight against the plague, when the outcome in that unfair war is almost certain death...<br /><br />I won't give you the answers they find, if any. For that, you need to read the book... However, I can tell you Albert Camus' opinion. Camus (1913-1960) thought that it is in the fighting against evil that mankind finds its greatness (and maybe justification, who knows), even if we face what might seem at first sight a desperate situation. In a way, I think that for Camus the plague was in this case an allegory of evil, and our attitude against it. That evil changes faces, but always reappears, and it is again time to make choices, and decide what kind of attitude we will take. It is only in the right decisions that we will find the meaning we were searching for.<br /><br />Again, recommended...<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-01-31

Oscar Agust&iacute;n Alejandro Schulz Solari (1887-1963) was born with that name, but later decided that he wanted to change it to Xul Solar, a phonetic equivalent of his parents surnames. Xul was many things: a painter, an astrologist, a mystic, a creator of languages and religions. He participated actively in the Argentinian artistic scene from the 1920's onwards, and was permanently involved in new endeavors with  friends such as Jorge Luis Borges, Oliverio Girondo, Leopoldo Marechal, and Macedonio Fern&aacute;ndez. According to Borges, \\"Hombre versado en todas las disciplinas, curioso de todos los arcanos, padre de escrituras, de lenguajes, de utop&iacute;as, de mitolog&iacute;as, hu&eacute;sped de infiernos y de cielos, autor panajedrecista y astr&oacute;logo perfecto en la indulgente iron&iacute;a y en la generosa amistad, Xul Solar es uno de los acontecimientos m&aacute;s singulares de nuestra &eacute;poca\\".<br /><br />Because of all that, it isn't easy to find a good biography about Xul, because such a biography would have to be little less than a biography of everything. Fortunately for us, \\"Xul Solar: pintor del misterio\\" is almost certainly such a biography. Well documented and easy to read, it is evident that &Aacute;lvaro Ab&oacute;s had a great idea when he decided to write this book.<br /><br />Notwithstanding that, I think that this biography could have been even better if it had had illustrations of at least some of Xul's paintings. All the same, we can solve that inconvenient if we visit [...] a website where you can admire Xul Solar's works. Do you really need to do that?. Well, allowing Borges to speak again, \\"Sus pinturas son documentos del mundo ultraterreno, del mundo metaf&iacute;sico en que los dioses toman las formas de la imaginaci&oacute;n que los sue&ntilde;a. La apasionada arquitectura, los colores felices, los muchos pormenores circunstanciales, los laberintos, los hom&uacute;nculos y los &aacute;ngeles inolvidablemente definen este arte delicado y monumental.El gusto de nuestro tiempo vacila entre el mero agrado lineal, la transcripci&oacute;n emotiva y el realismo con brocha gorda; Xul Solar renueva, a su modo ambicioso que quiere ser modesto, la m&iacute;stica pintura de los que no ven con los ojos f&iacute;sicos en el ambito sagrado de Blake, de Swedenborg, de yoguis y de bardos\\".

All the same, it is an essential way to start if we want to know more about him, as a writer but also as a person.<br /><br />If you buy \\"Vivir para contarla\\", you can expect a wonderful prose, interesting and somewhat strange metaphors, and the kind of description that manages to capture a moment in such a way that the reader feels that he was there too. An excellent example of that is what Garc&iacute;a Marquez writes about the moment when he arrives at Cartagena after leaving Bogot&aacute; in the aftermath of the great 1948 riot: \\"A principios de la semana hab&iacute;a dejado a Bogot&aacute; chapaleando en un pantano de sangre y lodo, todav&iacute;a con promotorios de cad&aacute;veres sin due&ntilde;os abandonados entre escombros humeantes. De pronto, el mundo se hab&iacute;a vuelto otro en Cartagena. No hab&iacute;a rastros de la guerra que asolaba el pa&iacute;s y me costaba trabajo creer que aquella soledad sin dolor, aquel mar incesante, aquella inmensa sensaci&oacute;n de haber llegado me estaban sucediendo apenas una semana despu&eacute;s en una misma vida\\". Incredible, isn't it?.<br /><br />The author shares information about his eccentric extended family, and stories where myth and reality seem so mixed that they are impossible to differentiate. Garc&iacute;a Marquez also tells details of his school years, when he learnt from books but also from people: \\"No s&eacute; que aprend&iacute; en realidad durante el cautiverio del Liceo Nacional, pero los cuatro a&ntilde;os de convivencia bien avenida con todos me infundieron una visi&oacute;n unitaria de la naci&oacute;n, descubr&iacute; cu&aacute;n diversos &eacute;ramos y para qu&eacute; serv&iacute;amos, y aprend&iacute; para no olvidarlo nunca que en la suma de cada uno de nosotros estaba todo el pa&iacute;s\\". It is rather funny to read how much he disliked to study, and the way he avoided questions by talking of his great passion: literature. Afterwards he would try to study law, but his heart wasn't on that, so he abandoned his studies after a while to dedicate all his energies to writing...<br /><br />The reader will be treated to a great description of his innumerable friends, and will feel he also was part of their daily discussions about literature, and Colombia. The curious reader will learn about Garc&iacute;a Marquez's favorite books, ideas, and reasons for writing. He says that \\"Cada cosa, con s&oacute;lo mirarla, me suscitaba una ansiedad irresistible de escribir para no morir\\", and remembers what Rilke wrote: \\"Si usted cree que es capaz de vivir sin escribir, no escriba\\".<br /><br />On the whole, I highly recommend this book. Reading it is remembering that the power of words is so great that it can make us visit places we haven't gone to, and live lives different to our own...<br /><br />Belen Alcatbut his heart wasn't on that, so he abandoned his studies after a while to dedicate all his energies to writing...

Despite his opposition, his mother sent him to a boarding school, and he is there when he receives a message telling him that his supposedly dead father is very much alive, and held for ransom by the Russian Mafia. Ironically enough, this time Artemis will need the help of the fairyfolk to rescue his father. The problem is that most of them detest him, especially his former hostage Captain Holly Short.  How will Artemis solve this \\"little\\" inconvenient?.<br /><br />As if that problem weren't big enough, there is also another little matter that must be taken into account: the goblin attempt to dominate the fairyworld, with human help. Throw in a lot of deceit, some violence and a certain amount of espionage, stir, and you will have an explosive situation that Artemis must worry about because... how can the fairies help him, even if they wanted to, if they face an overthrow of their government  by violent means?.<br /><br />All in all, I think your kids are highly likely to love this book (that's essential), and you won't die of boredom if you read it to them (hey, that's very important too).  Recommended!!!<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-01-20

The 1st twist is that he isn't mad: fairies do exist, even though they have managed to stay hidden underground for a long, long time. The 2nd twist is that our intelligent delinquent is merely 12 years old :)<br /><br />Artemis will have the help of his loyal bodyguard Butler in his \\"little project\\", that involves kidnapping a fairy in order to ask for a ransom in gold. The problem is that when Artemis puts his plan into action he kidnaps no less than the equivalent of a human police officer, plucky Captain Holly Short of the Lower Elements Police Reconnaisance Unit. After that, trouble arises soon enough, escalating quite quickly when the fairyfolk realize one of them has been captured. Who will win?. Well, to know that you will have to read the book !!!.<br /><br />On the whole, I can say that I recommend this book. It doesn't have much to do with traditional fairy tales, but it takes some of their magic and mixtures it with an enterprising young crook without too many remorses, and some worthy opponents worth their salt. Your children (and even you) are highly likely to like this oddly original book, and its strange anti-hero !!!.<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2005-01-20

Gabriel Garc&iacute;a Marquez says that \\"Life is not what one lived, but what one remembers and how one remembers it in order to recount it.\\" And that is, in few words, \\"Living to tell the tale\\": the author's version of his own life, as he remembers it now.<br /><br />This book is merely the first volume in the author's three-part autobiography, but it is an essential way to start if we want to know more about him, as a writer but also as a person. As we read this book, we become enchanted by the author's eccentric extended family (he is the oldest of 15, between brothers and sisters, in and out of wedlock), and by all the events that would give him inspiration for future books. One of those events is his trip to his native town of Aratacata, in order to help his mother to sell her parents' house in that town. It is in that trip that he decides  \\"I'm going to be a writer...Nothing but a writer\\".<br /><br />Of course, this isn't a traditional biography, but that is something the reader is likely to know in advance, if he takes into account that the author of \\"Living to tell the tale\\" is Garc&iacute;a Marquez. You can expect a wonderful prose, interesting and somewhat strange metaphors, and the kind of description that manages to capture a moment in such a way that the reader feels that he was there too. That happened to me many times while I was reading this book, for instance when he describes his visit to Aratacata, his inspiration for Macondo: \\"The first thing that struck me was the silence. A material silence I could have identified blindfolded among all the other silences in the world. The reverberation of the heat was so intense that you seemed to be looking at everything through undulating glass. As far as the eye could see there was no recollection of human life, nothing that was not covered by a faint sprinkling of burning dust\\".<br /><br />What is more, Garc&iacute;a Marquez shares details of his school years, his multitude of friends, and the innumerable nights all of them passed discussing many things, but mainly literature, and Colombia. The aspiring writer, or the curious reader, will know more about his favourite books, ideas, and reasons for writing (\\"Each thing, just by looking at it, aroused in me an irresistible longing to write so I would not die\\"). Garc&iacute;a Marquez also gives us some small details that make him more real, for example that he always has had lots of problems with orthography  :)<br /><br />Notwithstanding that, I suppose that a warning is in order: if you cannot stand a book that isn't linear, you aren't likely to like this book. \\"Living to tell the tale\\" is beautifully written, and gives us an enormous amount of information about Garc&iacute;a Marquez's life. However, the author jumps between years and events quite frequently, something that some people might dislike. I wasn't bothered by that, mainly because I think that is merely another resource he uses to succeed in his aim, that is tell a good story and charm his reader.<br /><br />Also, I would like to point out that even though this translation to English is quite good, it isn't the same than reading \\"Vivir para contarla\\" (= \\"Living to tell the tale\\") in the original Spanish edition. There are some things that cannot be translated, particularly in literature, without losing at least some nuances of meaning. If that is the case, you might ask yourself why do I give the English edition of this book 5 stars out of five. The answer is simple: I loved this book so much that I even liked the translation. All the same, the only true solution to appreciate just how good it is would be to read it in Spanish, so if you don't speak it yet, learn it. You won't find a better reason to do so  :)<br /><br />On the whole, I highly recommend this book. Yes, \\"Living to tell the tale\\" might seem at first sight rather long (544 pages), but that first impression changes quite quickly once you start to read it, because you realize that such a simple looking book contains the events and people that shaped the boy, teenager and young adult that would grow to become one of the best writers of our times.

That phrase, said by one of the main characters of \\"Waiting for Godot\\", somehow sums up the whole plot of this short tragicomedy in two acts. Strange??. You can bet on that!!!. So much that a well-known Irish critic said of it \\"nothing happens, twice\\".<br /><br />The play starts with two men, Vladimir and Estragon, sitting on a lonely road. They are both waiting for Godot. They don't know why they are waiting for him, but they think that his arrival will change things for the better. The problem is that he doesn't come, although a kid does so and says Godot will eventually arrive. Pozzo and his servant Lucky, two other characters that pass by while our protagonists are waiting for Godot, add another bizarre touch to an already surreal story, in which nothing seems to happen and discussions between the characters don't make much sense.<br /><br />However, maybe that is exactly the point that Samuel Beckett (1906-1989) wanted to make. He was one of the most accomplished exponents of the \\"Theatre of the Absurd\\", that wanted to highlight the lack of purpose and meaning in an universe without God. Does Godot, the person that Vladimir and Estragon endlessly wait, symbolize God?. According to an irascible Beckett, when hard-pressed to answer that question, \\"If I knew who Godot was, I would have said so in the play.\\" So, we don't know. The result is a highly unusual play that poses many questions, but doesn't answer them.<br /><br />Ripe with symbolism, \\"Waiting for Godot\\" is a play more or less open to different interpretations. Why more or less open?. Well, because in order to have an interpretation of your own, you have to finish the play, and that is something that not all readers can do. \\"Waiting for Godot\\" is neither too long nor too difficult, but it shows a lack of action and purpose in the characters that is likely to annoy many before they reach the final pages, leading them to abandon the book in a hurry. That is specially true if the reader is a student who thinks he is being barbarously tortured by a hateful teacher who told him to write a paper on \\"Waiting for Godot\\" :)<br /><br />My advice, for what it is worth, is that you should persist in reading it. If it puts you to sleep, try reading it aloud with some friends, and discuss with them the implications of what happens with the characters. This play might not be thoroughly engaging, but it changed theatre and the possibilities opened before it forever. In a way, it provoked a blood-less revolution, and because of that it deserves at least a bit of our attention.<br /><br />Belen Alcathurry.

According to Kierkegaard, there are three stages or spheres of existence: the aesthetic, the ethical and the religious one. In \\"The seducer's diary\\", the author depicts the life of someone who has made a conscious choice for the aesthetic way of life, with all the consequences that implies.<br /><br />The plot is simple, and the book is very short, but all the same the reader will become easily and quickly involved with the characters, and won't be able to forget the lessons learned through them. Johannes is a seducer for vocation and profession: being a seducer isn't really his job, but that is undoubtedly what gives meaning to his life. He likes women only until they have given him everything: it is then that he leaves them, and searches for a new \\"love\\". Johannes isn't capable of a big love that will last forever, but rather of many fleeting little \\"loves\\", with a definite time limit (\\"I am an aesthete, an eroticist, who has grasped the nature and the point of love, who believes in love and knows it from the ground up, and I reserve for myself only the private opinion that no love affair should last more that a half a year at most and that any relationship is over as soon as one has enjoyed the ultimate.\\").<br /><br />\\"The seducer's diary\\" is a transcription of part of Johannes diary. Here the reader will be able to follow the different stages of Johannes seduction (and ultimate betrayal) of Cordelia, his prey. The way in which Johannes plans the above mentioned seduction is rather astonishing, due to the fact that he thinks about it as a \\"war of conquest\\" that he has to win little by little, through many well-conceived strategies. Not matter how passionate he might seem at times, we are remembered again and again that he is cold-bloodedly constant to his primal purpose.<br /><br />On the whole, I really liked \\"The seducer's diary\\", and can recommend it to you. To tell the truth, I cannot say that I loved the ending, but I can see that it illustrates Kierkegaard point of view perfectly, bringing home the idea that a purely aesthetic way of life isn't an intelligent choice. Of course, we already knew that, but it is all the same a good idea to read why, expressed in such a conspicuously clear way as this.<br /><br />Belen Alcatly, bringing home the idea that a purely aesthetic way of life isn't an intelligent choice.

Mainly that means that he writes a book and gets paid for doing so, while someone else receives the credit for the job. Costa is married to a successful journalist, and has a son. He is neither terribly happy nor horribly unhappy, but he wants to change his routine. That is probably the reason why he accepts the invitation to the Anonymous Writers' Convention to be held at Istanbul. Costa goes there, and has a wonderful time, but something life-changing happens to him when his airplane somehow gets stranded in Budapest (Hungary) during his returning trip to Rio de Janeiro. He hears the Hungarian language, and feels the need to learn it, to understand what makes it so poetic...<br /><br />Unfortunately that isn't possible, and Costa has to return to Brazil, to his family and to his job. But he won't be able to forget his ardent wish to learn Hungarian, and will even mutter some of it in his sleep. Soon enough, Jos&eacute; Costa knows that he is a man with a mission: he must return to Budapest and learn Hungarian, \\"rumoured to be the only tongue in the world the devil respects.\\". In that trip and in others that will come, Costa will find the meaning of Hungarian, of languages, and of words, and will rediscover the magic of his own language by forbidding himself to speak it for a long time (\\"Perhaps it was possible to replace one language with another in my head, little by little, discarding a word for every word acquired. For a time, my head would be like a house undergoing renovations, with new words being hoisted up through one ear and the rubble being lowered down through the other\\"). There will be another woman, and another boy, a possible family so similar to his own... All that, in Budapest, the yellow city in Hungary that will compete with Brazil and Rio de Janeiro for Costa's allegiance. Some questions stand out so much that even the reader will have to find an answer of his own. For instance, are we necessarily born into a language, or can we adopt the one that pleases us most?.<br /><br />\\"Budapest\\" is a strange book, somehow confusing at times, but also deeply engaging. The reader will be interested in Costa's life as he travels once and again between Rio de Janeiro and Budapest, but also on the many reflections on the nature of words, language, life, anonymity and fame that appear in this book. Of course, the author of \\"Budapest\\" is as peculiar as the book itself. Chico Buarque is a famous Brazilian artist, better known for his music than for his books. Notoriously press-shy, he might even see himself as a kind of Jos&eacute; Costa, someone who wants to write just for the sake of it, not needing fame to be happy.<br /><br />Chico wrote this book without having visited Budapest, merely with the help of a dictionary and a tourist guide of that city. Disregarding that, the results were wonderful, something the reader will be able to appreciate even in \\"Budapest\\"'s translation to English. This translation cannot help but lose some of the charm that is intrinsic to the Portuguese language, despite being very good. All the same, it is as good as one can be, due to the fact that Buarque worked alongside the translator who did it, in order to help when some things had to be rewritten because \\"They did not translate\\".<br /><br />\\"I'm an amateur\\" said Chico Buarque in an interview about \\"Budapest\\". \\"It's the same with songs. I'm not a professional. Yet somehow I manage to get away with it\\". I think that in this case, as in many other occasions, Buarque is being overly modest.

This book is the latest novel written by Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez. It is short, but rather ambitious, due to the fact that it tries to tell us everything that should be known about the life of a 90-year-old man, from his own perspective, in merely 112 pages. Thankfully, the author succeeds in doing exactly that.<br /><br />Everything starts when the main character decides that spending a night with a young virgin is a great way of celebrating his birthday. So, the eve of turning ninety, he calls Rosa Cabarcas, the woman who manages the brothel he used to visit a long time ago. That phone call would change everything: \\"aquel fue el principio de una nueva vida a una edad en la que la mayor&iacute;a de los mortales est&aacute;n muertos\\". To start with, a man who had always paid to have sex would learn to love for the first time. Not only that, but he would also learn more about himself and others, a new knowledge that would motivate him to write a written account of what happened. In his own words, \\"Nunca hice nada distinto de escribir, pero no tengo vocaci&oacute;n ni virtud de narrador, ignoro por completo las leyes de la composici&oacute;n dram&aacute;tica, y si me he embarcado en esta empresa es porque conf&iacute;o en la luz de lo mucho que he le&iacute;do en la vida.

The author manages to convey to the reader ideas, feelings and concepts that make him forget that he is reading a story instead of just living it.

He was an important exponent of what became known as \\"the Theatre of Absurd\\", a kind of avant garde theatre that was born more or less in the 1950s and that somehow manages to transmit a message through irrational speech and strange occurrences that take place in what seem at first glance as common situations. Other exponents of this kind of theatre are, for example, Samuel Beckett, Jean Genet and Harold Pinter<br /><br />\\"Rhinoceros\\" was written by Ionesco in 1958, and has a strange plot. The main character is Berenger, a Frenchman who likes to drink a lot. Berenger doesn't seem to mind when a rhinoceros first appears running past his town square, while he is talking with his friend Jean. Everybody else is astounded, but they are truly horrified when the same rhinoceros (or maybe another one) returns and even kills a cat.  Even that doesn't shake Berenger, unfortunately. The situation is almost dramatically altered later, when Berenger realizes that many of his acquaintances are turning into rhinoceros without apparent reason. The pertinent questions are quite a few, for instance: will rhinoceros ultimately prevail?. And can an average person resist to conformity, or is the temptation to be like everybody else to big?.<br /><br />This book can be understood as a metaphore regarding nazism and its diffusion in Germany, and has a lot to do with Ionesco's experiences with the Nazis. However, its main theme is the rise of totalitarism, the kind of behaviour and relativism that takes a country to that, and the dehumanization of those that succumb to conformism (like the human beings that slowly turn into rhinoceros, almost indistinguishable from each other). Due to that, \\"Rhinoceros\\" was considered a dangerous play by more than one totalitarism. For instance, the play was to be produced in the URSS, but the government wouldn't allow it to be played if Ionesco didn't say that the rhinoceros were the Nazis and not them. As Ionesco refused to do so, \\"Rhinoceros\\" couldn't be played...<br /><br />On the whole, I can say that I really liked this play. It is interesting, easy to read (yes, without overly difficult vocabulary!!) and has a deeper meaning that shouldn't be lost to us.

That's Jorge Luis Borges definition of his friend Xul Solar, a person he evidently admired deeply.<br /><br />Xul Solar (1887-1963) was the pen name of a wonderful Argentinian artist, Oscar Agust&iacute;n Alejandro Schulz Solari, who incorporated different elements in his strange but interesting works. He was an eclectic, and as such dabbled in mysticism, astrology, numerology and many other subjects... All of that can be observed in his paintings, who vary a lot through his different periods. Not content with being a painter, he was also a sculptor, a writer and an inventor of two imaginary languages (\\"Pan Criollo\\" y \\"Pan Lingua\\").<br /><br />This book contains some of Xul Solar's best works, but isn't by any means complete, and lacks an in-depth analysis even of the paintings included.

Shortly afterwards, the main narrator changes: now it is Billy Pilgrim, who like the writer is a former soldier in World War II. The writer and Billy survived the bombardment of Dresden, the city were both were held as prisioners of war (yes, Vonnegut was a POW in the 2nd WW). They stayed in a place called \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\", due to the mere fact that that placed used to be...a slaughterhouse.<br /><br />Billy has some peculiarities that  no one else seems to share: he can become \\"unstuck\\" in time, going seamlessly from the present to the past or the future, and from there to the present again. He is also quite familiar with aliens, having spent a season with them in their planet (as a specimen in the Tralfamadorian zoo), and isn't shy to tell so. Of course, that brings him a few problems with his family, who wants him to upheld his image of respectable optometrist, but that cannot be helped.<br /><br />This work has an anti-war tone that pervades the whole book. That is evident in the musings of the characters on the absurdity of war, and on how illogical many actions were (a good example would be the bombardment of Dresden, a city that lacked war industries). Billy, one of the protagonists of the book, accepts things as they come, and after every death he simply says \\"So it goes\\". He probably is the best illustration of the fact that \\"There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick, and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war, after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters...\\" Also, and even though Vonnegut writes that \\"there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre\\", I think that thanks to this book he gives at least a good statement on the massacre of war.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is a book beyond strange, so if you prefer linear stories, you are highly likely to dislike this one. If there is something that stands out in it, is its lack of chronological continuity. Despite that, I recommend it even to them, because who knows, they may like it. After all, this book has been considered a classic for many years now, so it certainly has some value. On the other hand, if you are one of those who prefer the unexpected in a book, you just must read it, because I'm certain you will love \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\".<br /><br />Belen Alcatbecause most of the people in it are so sick, and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces.

It starts in a really weird way, with the demolition of Earth (yes, our planet) in order to build a interestellar highway. Only one man survives the end of our world: an Englishman, Arthur Dent. Arthur is saved from sure death by one of his friends, Ford Prefect, that also happened to be an alien doing some research for \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" (an electronic book that \\"tells you everything you need to know about anything\\", and that specially highlights the need for a towel).<br /><br />Ford got a lift for them with a Vogon spaceship, where they would soon be subjected to a danger worse than death: Vogon poetry. Anyway, as nothing bad last forever, there were soon ejected into space to suffer certain and painful death, only to be rescued again just in time to begin their adventures.<br /><br />Both Ford and Arthur are interesting characters, but I found Arthur's whining particularly funny. For example, and in his own words to Ford: \\"you are talking about a positive mental attitude and you haven't even had your planet demolished today. I woke up this morning and thought I'd have a nice relaxed day, do a bit of reading, brush the dog... It is now just after four in the afternoon and I am already being thrown out of an alien spaceship six light-years from the smoking remains of the Earth!\\".<br /><br />There are other characters and things you will find interesting, like an eternally depressed robot (life, \\"loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it\\"), Zaphod Beeblebrox, and the Babel fish (capable of translating any language in the galaxy if you put them in your ear). There are also some scenes that appear out of the blue, but that are quite enchanting. For instance \\"Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something important. Suddenly he realized what it was. - Is there any tea on this spaceship?-he said\\".<br /><br />On the whole, I highly recommend this book. Its premise is extremely original, and you will have lots of fun reading it. If you can, buy it know, and be ready to meet the mice *  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat  (* = you will understand that phrase only after reading this book!!!)whole, I highly recommend this book.

Lenin wrote this book in 1917, while he was hiding from the Russian government. Lenin pointed out that \\"The question of the relation of the state to the social revolution, and of the social revolution to the state, like the question of revolution generally, was given very little attention by the leading theoreticians and publicists of the Second International (1889-1914)\\". He wanted to correct that oversight, and that is probably the main reason why he wrote this book.<br /><br />\\"The State and revolution\\" is a very short book, well structured and not difficult to read at all. Initially this pamphlet was going to have seven chapters, but Lenin didn't conclude the seventh, due to the outbreak of the Russian revolution. In the postscript to the first edition he explains that, saying that due to the reasons already explained the conclusion of the seventh chapters would have to be put off for quite a long time, but that all the same \\"It is more pleasant and useful to go through the `experience of revolution' than to write about it\\".<br /><br />The main idea in \\"The State and revolution\\" is that the State is a product of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms, and an instrument for the exploitation of the oppressed class (a \\"special coercive force\\" that rules through violence). The State of the bourgeoisie will disappear, but only through a revolution that will take the people to the dictatorship of the proletariat. The proletariat (the working class) will become then the ruling class, \\"capable of crushing the inevitable and desperate resistance of the bourgeoisie, and of organizing all the working and exploited people for the new economic system. The proletariat needs state power, a centralized organization of force, an organization of violence, both to crush the resistance of the exploiters and to lead the enormous mass of the population -the peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and semi-proletarians- in the work of organizing a socialist economy.\\"<br /><br />The dictatorship of the proletariat will be only a first stage in the path to Communism (\\"Then the door will be thrown wide open for the transition from the first phase of communist society to its higher phase, and with it to the complete withering away of the state\\"). According to Lenin, the necessity of systematically imbuing the masses with the idea of the necessity of violent revolution lies at the root of the entire theory of Marx and Engels. All throughout this book, Lenin cites and examines Marx and Engels' writings, in order to explain and support his own point of view.<br /><br />The importance of Marxism for nowadays world has diminished enormously, but I advice you to read this book nonetheless. It is certainly not a grueling task, and it will allow you to understand better some notions that many Marxist leaders believed with all their hearts. Ideas drive men, and men make history. \\"The State and revolution\\" will help you to get acquainted with some of those ideas, and that is not a small feat.<br /><br />Belen Alcatoletariat will be only a first stage in the path to Communism (\\"Then the door will be thrown wide open for the transition from the first phase of communist society to its higher phase, and with it to the complete withering away of the state\\").

These books have a lot of action, magic and yes, some romance. But more importantly, they are thoroughly engaging, so be prepared to be immersed in a world that differs quite a bit from our own.<br /><br />The narrator of \\"Dime store magic\\" is Paige Winterbourne, a 23-year-old witch who suddenly finds herself as guardian of Savannah Levine, the irritable 13-year-old daughter of Eve, the black sheep of Paige's family. Unfortunately, Savannah isn't just an annoyed teenager angry with everything and everyone: she is also a witch with growing powers and a noticeable tendency towards dark magic, like her mother. On top of everything, Paige also becomes the leader of her Coven (due to the death of her mother, narrated in \\"Stolen\\"). It is worthwhile to point out that the position is mostly nominal, though, as Paige doesn't get a lot of respect from the other witches.<br /><br />Life isn't obviously too easy for Paige, but neither is it overly problematic. That changes, though, when Savannah's previously unknown father, a powerful wizard, decides to fight for custody in order to gain control of his daughter's power. Paige won't give in without a fight, as wizards are traditional enemies of witches. The result is that she will have to put her life and reputation on the line, and will need to accept help from whomever can give it. That includes Lucas Cortez, a lawyer but also a wizard that has rebelled against his heritage and goes from quest to quest striving to make justice.  In Paige's words, \\"It was a sad world when a witch had to rely on a work-starved sorcerer for help\\". The fact is, soon enough she will view Lucas in a different way...<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this book. In my opinion, it is an excellent addition to the series, and will make you want to read the sequel immediately. For that, you will have to buy or borrow \\"Industrial magic\\"... But in the meanwhile, enjoy \\"Dime store magic\\" :)<br /><br />Belen Alcatmagic\\" :)    Belen Alcat	2004-12-23

In his own words, \\"I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy\\".<br /><br />The plot is quite simple, mainly what happens when a particularly sensitive teenager gets kicked out of school, and decides to travel alone a little bit instead of just telling his parents what happened. However, even if the main premise is common enough, the way it is delivered is what makes this book so special that it has become a classic. Salinger makes us get to know Holden, giving  the reader interesting insights into his musings, likes and dislikes (yeah, generally mostly dislikes).<br /><br />You want some examples?. For instance, and regarding teachers, he says that \\"You can't stop a teacher when they want to do something. They just do it\\". Or when he starts to think about the things we say over and over again, without giving them any actual meaning: \\"I'm always saying `Glad to `ve met you` to somebody I'm not at all glad I met. If you want to stay alive, you have to say that stuff, though\\".<br /><br />Holden's views are interesting, and different readers will interpret them in diverse ways, specially if their age isn't the same. To teenagers, Holden  reflects the highs and lows they have to deal with, and their struggle with the \\"phony world\\" of adults that sometimes seems so weird, so wrong. To adults, Holden is a part of themselves that they somehow lost with the years, the innocence and the shock before things they have grown accustomed to with time.<br /><br />There are quite a few symbols in this book, but you will able to understand it even if you don't know a thing about symbology (or aren't interested in it). Despite that, I'd like to share with you a specially important symbol, the catcher in the rye that gives this book its title. Holden wants to be the catcher in the rye when he grows up: \\"Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around--nobody big, I mean--except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff--I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going. I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.\\" . He doesn't know why, he just wants to come out from somewhere and catch little children before they fall from the cliff. In a way, that shows how much he wants to preserve their innocence, against a phony world that tries to corrupt them...<br /><br />I really liked this book, and I found it engaging and very easy to read. I'm not from USA, so I didn't have to read it as obligatory reading material for school, but I ended up reading it all the same mainly out of curiosity because many of my American friends recommended it to me. After reading \\"The catcher in the rye\\", I must say that they were right, and I would like to recommend this book to you, if you haven't read it yet. And if you are forced to read it for school, please JUST GIVE IT AN OPPORTUNITY. I know it is hateful having to read something merely because someone says so, but in this case that will work to your advantage... What can I say?. This book, unlike so many others, is really WORTH YOUR TIME.<br /><br />Belen Alcatnts to be the catcher in the rye when he grows up: \\"Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all.

Robb's \\"In Death\\" series, and not one I would recommend for someone who just wants to give the series a try. If that is your case, please make yourself a favour, and read the first book in the series, \\"Naked in death\\". That book is excellent, and will give you such a good introduction to the main characters that you will enjoy the rest of the books in the series much more :)<br /><br />Now, if you are still reading this review I must suppose that you already have read that book, and so you know what the \\"In death\\" series is about: a very good cop (Eve), her unlikely husband (Roarke), and the crimes they somehow end up solving together. Of course, by summing up the series in such succinct manner I leave aside a lot of the details that  make the series so good but then, if I want to be concise I have to sacrifice something: nothing is perfect  :)<br /><br />\\"Holiday in death\\" definitely isn't perfect either. The plot is pretty simple: it is almost Christmas time, and Lieutenant Eve Dallas not only has to buy presents for her loved ones (she hates shopping!!!), but also to deal with a killer who dresses up as Santa Claus, rings the doorbell of his victims and kills them. The only link between the victims is a dating service, and so Eve decides some undercover work is in order to catch the killer, before he continues with his \\"special\\" way of celebrating Christmas. Officers Peabody and Mc Nabb will be the undercover agents, and also the protagonists of a secondary storyline that the fans of the series have been waiting for some time :)<br /><br />I certainly cannot say that this is my favourite book in the series. Despite that, and strangely enough, I DO RECOMMEND IT. Why?. Well, because it has more than average \\"entertainment value\\", if you like to mix suspense, a bit of romance and an interesting futuristic spin. I want to point out, though, that the crime scenes that all the books in the series have are specially horrific in \\"Holiday in death\\", so please don't read it if you can't stand gory scenes. I don't like them, and that is the reason why I gave this book 3 stars instead of at least 4, but that's your decision to make, after weighing the pros and cons of giving \\"Holiday in death\\" a try...<br /><br />Belen Alcatorrific in \\"Holiday in death\\", so please don't read it if you can't stand gory scenes.

This book can be read by itself, but you will probably enjoy it much more if you read first \\"Naked in death\\", the first book in the series, and then the others that follow it.<br /><br />In \\"Loyalty in death\\" Lieutenant Eve Dallas continues to fight crime, and has to face a dangerous terrorist threat that has its roots in the past. She has the help of her dependable aide Delia Peabody (who is a little distracted due to love problems and a visiting brother), and that of her \\"civilian\\" husband, Roarke (who will help her whether she wants his help or not). Both Eve and Roarke receive taunting messages from the terrorist group, that dares Eve to stop them, and makes targets out of Roarke's properties.<br /><br />The question is, will Eve be able to find and stop the terrorists before they hurt innocent people?.

In order to do that she had to face a powerful Cabal, which is a mafia-like organization of sorcerers. Should I tell that witches and sorcerers aren't exactly on good terms?. And that Paige got to meet her new boyfriend Lucas, a sorcerer/lawyer, in the process of gaining Savannah's custody?.<br /><br />In this book we get to see Paige and Lucas living together, and trying to keep Lucas's father, powerful Cabal leader Benicio Cortez, at a distance. The problem is that Benicio wants Lucas to assume the place of heir to the Cortez Cabal, despite being his youngest son, illegitimate, and the proud owner of quixotic tendencies that take him to endorse causes against the Cabal. Benicio loves his son, so he decides that asking for Lucas and Paige's help in an investigation involving the assault on a young witch (daughter of a Cortez Cabal employee) is a good way to approach him.<br /><br />Clearly, both are very tempted to say no to Benicio's offer, but soon enough they realise that the assault is related to quite a few assassinations of other teenagers that belong to Cabal's families, and possibly to a supernatural killer. After that, can Paige and Lucas really say no?.<br /><br />In \\"Industrial magic\\" we get to meet again our favourite werewolves (Elena, Clay and Jeremy), some of the vampires we already met (Cassandra and Aaron) and a few others, more half- demons and shamans, and even a necromancer. Also, we learn a lot more about the different Cabals and their inner struggles, about Lucas' dysfunctional family and Paige's attempts to come to terms with it. Of course, that isn't easy for her: how would you feel if your prospective brother-in-law had tried to kill you?.<br /><br />So far, the first two books in the \\"Women of the Otherworld\\" series were centered on the werewolf Pack (through Clay and Elena's story), and the other two were centered on witches and sorcerers (through Lucas and Paige's story).

However, things aren't always what they seem to be: Elena is a werewolf, the only female werewolf in the world to be precise...<br /><br />Elena was turned into a werewolf by her previous fianc&eacute;e, Clay, who wanted her to be with him forever, and thus did something forbidden by Pack Law: he bit her. Against all odds Elena survived, but she felt betrayed by Clay and ultimately left the Pack.<br /><br />Now, however, the Pack needs her: a band of mutts (not Pack werewolves) are killing humans, and they must be stopped. So when Jeremy the alpha werewolf calls her, she decides to return and face her past, even though she isn't specially eager to do so.<br /><br />Truth to be told, this is the first book by Kelley Armstrong that I have read, and I discovered it by chance. A friend told me to visit Armstrong's website ([...]) to read some of her free novellas, and I did exactly that when I had some free time. I didn't regret it: the three free novellas that Kelley offers in her website are  just awesome. \\"Ascension\\", \\"Savage\\" and \\"Beginnings\\" are prequels to \\"Bitten\\", and quite different to other things I have read (different in a good way, though).<br /><br />My immediate reaction after reading Armstrong's free novellas was to buy \\"Bitten\\", Armstrong's first published novel and coincidently the first book in the \\"Women of the Otherworld\\" series.

At first sight the plot of this book seems almost banal. After all, who wants to know how Clarissa Dalloway spends her day?. Isn't she merely a shallow woman who leds a boring life?.<br /><br />Of course, we should remember that first impressions are often misleading... and in this case, they certainly are. \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is nothing less that a ground-breaking novel in which Virginia Woolf pioneers a style that would later be called \\"stream of consciousness\\". Thanks to that style the reader can, literally, read the thoughts of the characters without any kind of censorship. Even though that makes the book somewhat unclear at times, it is nonetheless strangely attractive, and compelling.<br /><br />\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is the story of a day in Clarissa's life, but it is at the same time the story of  the people who know her, or that are somehow connected to her, and the story of  her/their dreams and thoughts. Virginia Woolf's goal in this book was ambitious, but she managed to achive it: she allows the reader to look right into the mind of the different characters...<br /><br />As I previously mentioned, the story of Mrs. Dalloway is at the same time the story of many more, as the story of each of us is also the story of the people we know/love/hate/like/dislike. There are many people who help us to understand Clarissa, thanks to their interactions with her. However, we also see her under a different light thanks to characters that don't know her, or are merely distantly connected to her through one of her many acquaintances. For example, Septimus Warren Smith, an ex-soldier who battles madness, and whose gloomy life provides a stark contrast to the artificial cheerfulness of Clarissa's own life. The two never meet, but it is impossible to try to understand one without the other...<br /><br />On the whole, I think you will enjoy this book. It is quite original, and gives the reader food for thought. It makes us realize that there is often more to people than what meets the eye. For that, I highly recommend \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" to you.<br /><br />Belen Alcatpeople than what meets the eye. For that, I highly recommend \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" to you.    Belen Alcat	2004-10-17

Have you ever wondered what is being said behind closed doors, in those places where important decisions are made?. If you have, Ernest R. May and Philip D. Zelikow allow you to learn just that, at least regarding the conversations that took place in the White House during the Cuban Missile Crisis.<br /><br />This book contains the transcriptions of those discussions, and many notes that contribute to clarify certain details that the reader might well not be aware of. The editors of \\"The Kennedy tapes\\" are able to offer us this unexpected treat thanks to the fact that an audio tape recorded the conversations of the committee that was formed to deal with the crisis. It is generally thought that only President Kennedy and his secretary knew that their words were being recorded, and we can easily believe that when we realize that the different functionaries said exactly what they thought, without wasting time in order to formulate their ideas in a politically correct way :)<br /><br />It is almost scary to know how little did the persons involved in the decision making process know about what was really happening at that time, and about how would the URSS react to their optional courses of action. But then, I guess that complete information is never available, and less during a crisis of that magnitude... However, after reading these pages, I cannot help but wonder what would have happened if, for example, USA had launched a preventive attack on Cuba. The answers to that question are many, and none of them is good. I suppose we should be grateful to President Kennedy and his advisors, for somehow arriving to a course of action that avoided the real possibility of a nuclear war.<br /><br />I think it is worthwhile to point out that the editors of this book wrote not only an interesting  introduction, but also an excellent conclusion to this book. The introduction explains very well the Cold War context in which this crisis developed, and how recent and ongoing events affected the perspective of the decision makers. On the other hand, the conclusion sums up what happened, taking into account \\"the other side\\" (URSS), and the peculiarities of the decision-making process in Soviet Russia. The editors also include their own considerations, all of which I consider worthwhile remembering. For example, when they reflect on the kind of lesson they think this book can teach to the reader, they say that \\"Someone who wants to learn all that can be learned from this extraordinary record of decision-making needs not only to notice how the process stutters and veers amid barrages of detail but also to infer how individuals of different backgrounds and temperaments are sorting the detail, discerning choices, and electing among those choices (...)\\".<br /><br />\\"The Kennedy tapes\\" is a rather impressive book due to the fact that it is quite long. However, it is also very helpful if you want to know more about the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the kind of environment that surrounds difficult decisions in the higher levels of authority. It is certainly more comfortable to believe that those decisions are at all times informed and rational, but unfortunately (as this book shows) that not always happens. May and Zelikow say that \\"Reconstruction that oversimplifies or ignores the incessant tension between realities and beliefs makes us no wiser. By coming fully to grips with the particulars of past moments of choice, we may become better able to handle our own\\". We can only hope that is the case...<br /><br />On the whole, I think you will benefit a lot from reading this book. It allows you the opportunity to really \\"listen\\" to what happened in the discussions surrounding the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, without intermediaries.

George Orwell (1903- 1950) wanted to help others to realize things that for him were evident, and attempted to do so by writing a fable that can easily be read as a satire of the Russian Revolution. Orwell said in an article that \\"Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism, as I understand it. It seems to me nonsense, in a period like our own, to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects. It is simply a question of which side one takes and what approach one follows\\".<br /><br />Orwell also pointed out that \\"Animal Farm was the first book in which I tried, with full consciousness of what I was doing, to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole\\". He succeded beyond his wildest expectations, even though at first nobody wanted to publish this work because it was too controversial.<br /><br />The plot of this book is relatively easy to grasp, and I think that is probably one of the reasons why it is so popular. Some animals decide to take over the conduction of a farm, because they believe there is too much injustice, and that they would improve the situation if they had the power to do so. They make a revolution, and end up evicting Mr. Jones, the owner of the farm. From that moment onwards, the farm is called \\"Animal farm\\"...<br /><br />The animals establish seven \\"commandments\\", that they are supposed to obey at all moments in the new \\"Animal farm\\": 1- Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy, 2 - Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend,  3- No animal shall wear clothes, 4 - No animal shall sleep in a bed , 5 -No animal shall drink alcohol, 6 - No animal shall kill another animal , 7- All animals are created equal.  At the same time, all commandments can be comprised in a maxim: \\"Four legs good, two legs bad\\".<br /><br />Everything seems all right for sometime, and all the animals work together for the success of the revolution, obeying the commandments and striving for a new order of things. However, after a while the pigs begin to think that being part of the animal revolution is not enough: they want to dominate it. After that first realization things take a quick turn for the worse, and we cease to be in the presence of a \\"wannabe utopical society\\",  having instead to be unwilling witnesses to the birth of a new totalitarian society.<br /><br />At that moment, the pigs even change some of the commandments. For example, the fourth commandment turns into \\"No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets\\", and the sixth commandment says \\"No animal shall kill another animal without cause\\". Now, the commandments can be reduced to \\"Four legs good, two legs better\\". Finally, all the commandments will be replaced with one: \\"All animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal than others\\".<br /><br />All in all, I consider \\"Animal farm\\" extremely interesting, even though it is somewhat sad and pessimistic. The language is clear, and you won't find yourself wondering what the author meant by a phrase, or needing to read a paragraph again. From my point of view, that makes the reading process even more enjoyable.<br /><br />Despite that, I believe that this book will be considerably more appreciated by those with some basic knowledge regarding the Russian Revolution. Only then will the reader be able to take full advantage of what this short fable can offer him, due to the fact that he will realize without too much effort that some of the fictional characters in \\"Animal Farm\\" were inspired by historical characters. For example, Napoleon (one of the pigs) was quite possibly inspired by Stalin, and Snowball (another pig) by Trosky. When you read this book, try to find the characters that represent the proletariat, the Communist Party,the intellectuals, etc... :)<br /><br />On the whole, I regard this book as one of those you just need to read, but that fortunately you can also enjoy. The messages implicit in \\"Animal farm\\" are many, and the questions it makes you pose yourself are even more. But then, what better than a book that makes you THINK ?.<br /><br />Belen Alcatd this book as one of those you just need to read, but that fortunately you can also enjoy.

Furet says, in the preface to this book, that \\"The passing of an illusion\\"  \\"is not a history of Communism, even less a history of the Soviet Union; it is a history of the illusion of Communism during the time in which the USSR lent it consistency and vitality\\". In my opinion, this book tells us a story, the story of a myth. That myth is no other that the Communist myth, that was supposed to bring a world of peace and freedom, and instead only brought more chains to those who chose to follow it.<br /><br />The October revolution was thought to be the continuation of the French Revolution, a new revolution that would finish the task the other couldn`t complete. Many continued to believe so even after it was fairly evident that that wasn't the case: the dictatorship of the proletariat had turned into arbitrary rule of the proletariat by a few. Of course, it was much easier to believe in the Communist myth living far away from the URSS than in that country, having to deal with the reality of oppression.<br /><br />Furet points out how ingeniously the URSS managed to retain its universalistic appeal even after Stalin imposed the doctrine of \\"socialism in one state\\". He also mentions the intelligent identification that the URSS tried to make between Communism and Anti-Fascism, and the realization that \\"Communism had to conceal its reality in order to remain an 'idea' \\". Many intellectuals were almost eager to be mislead: they hated Fascism so much that they didn`t wait much to \\"establish a subjective connection between Communism and liberty\\".<br /><br />\\"The passing of an illusion\\" is rather long, but it is more than worth your time and effort. Even though it doesn`t exhaust the subject, it allows the reader to learn a lot about it... Moreover, it was written by François Furet (1927-1997), a well-known French historian that somehow managed to convey wonderfully how important the theme was to him. In his own words, \\"I have a biographical connection with my subject: in my youth, I experienced the passing of an illusion as a Communist between 1949 and 1956. My subject is thus inseparable from my existence, and I experienced firsthand the illusion that I am attempting to trace back to the time in which it was most widespread\\".<br /><br />Why did the myth persist for so long, and how did it finally fall?. The author examines these questions, and finds some answers that I consider very interesting. However, those answers are quite long, so instead of repeating them I advice you to read this book :)<br /><br />On the whole, I recommend \\"The passing of an illusion\\" to all those who want to understand our present. Believe it or not, doing so is impossible without understanding the communist myth and its evolution. Ideas are important, and the impact of Communism over our century is just another proof of that...<br /><br />Belen Alcathe passing of an illusion as a Communist between 1949 and 1956.

The historical circumstances which determined their actions are real. The life of the man N. S. Rubashov is a synthesis of the lives of a number of men who were victims of the so-called Moscu Trials\\".That is part of the dedicatory that Koestler wrote for his book, \\"Darkness at noon\\".<br /><br />Arthur Koestler (1905-1983) was a person that believed in the progress that Communism was supposed to bring, but that became disillusioned in the way in which that dream was being carried out in the URSS. He wrote many books that give expression to his feelings of  disenchantment, but \\"Darkness at noon\\" is probably the most popular one.<br /><br />Not overly long, and very easy to read, this book is the story of Rubashov, an old communist who took part in the revolution and who is very loyal to the \\"Cause\\". Strangely enough, he is accused of treason, and taken to jail, where he must face harsh interrogatories. While he is in jail, Rubashov experiences flashbacks that allow us to know more about him, and the things he did due to his devotion to the Party. He betrayed people he loved, and those he appreciated, for no other reason than obedience to the Party and fear of going to jail.<br /><br />We can have an idea of Rubashov's feelings and ideas all throughout his ordeal thanks to the fact that \\"Darkness at noon\\" is written in the first person. After a while, we are Rubashov, and like him we are surprised, outraged, desperate and ultimately resigned to our luck.<br /><br />In the beginning, Rubashov says that he isn't a traitor and that he hasn't done the things he is accused of. But slowly our main character starts to come to terms with the idea that the truth of the accusation isn't really important, what matters is to serve the country. And if the leader (Number one) says he is to be blamed, he must have done something....<br /><br />The prisioner writes a diary, where he dwells upon the nature of men, and politics. He thinks that after the revolution he defended so passionately, an individual is defined merely as \\"a multitude of one million divided by one million\\". The individual doesn't matter because only the \\"Cause\\" matters. Regarding politics, he concludes that at the end only one thing is clear: \\"the end justifies the means\\". Is it any surprise, then, that the tone that pervades this book is so gloomy?.<br /><br />On the whole, I highly recommend \\"Darkness at noon\\"  to all of you, for two reasons. To start with, it is a literary masterpiece, beautifully written and accessible to the average reader. Secondly, and more important, it also shows us once again that every attempt to forget that the end doesn't justifies the means ends in a nightmare.<br /><br />Belen Alcatso passionately, an individual is defined merely as \\"a multitude of one million divided by one million\\".

Mikhail Bulgakov (1891-1940) endured the difficult experience of having to live under the pressure of censorship, but has nonetheless left some interesting books that allow us to know what he thought about the process that has taking place in the newborn Soviet Russia. \\"Heart of a dog\\"  is one of those books. It was written by Bulgakov in 1925, but it wasn`t published in Soviet Russia until 1987, due to the fact that it can easily be interpreted as a critical satire regarding the URSS.<br /><br />\\"Heart of a dog\\" is the story of a  stray dog, Sharik, that hasn`t led an easy life. He lives in the streets of  Moscow, and eats what he can, when he can. However, one day a doctor gives him food and takes him to his home. Sharik believes that his fate has changed, but he doesn`t know that the doctor has rather strange intentions...<br /><br />The doctor wants to perform an experiment on Sharik, in order to learn what would happen if some human organs were transplanted to a dog. The doctor performs the operation, implanting in Sharik the pituitary gland and the testicles of a dead criminal. Against all odds, Sharik survives the operation, and from that moment on begins an extraordinary transformation, that makes him more and more human.<br /><br />But what kind of human is he?. Sharik can talk, and asks everybody to call him first \\"Mr. Sharikov\\", and afterwards  \\"Polygraph Polygraphovich Sharikov\\". He also walks like a human being, and somehow resembles one... But can he think, or does he merely repeat what he hears, specially Marx`s teachings?. Has the doctor`s experiment ruined a perfectly good dog, making him a perfectly despicable \\"human\\" being that threatens to denounce counterrevolutionaries and chases cats?.<br /><br />I don`t want to tell you more about this book: you really should read it yourself. It isn`t long, but it is quite interesting. What is more important, it is open to many interpretations, and you can always find your own. Some people believe that for Bulgakov Sharik represented the failure of those who try to create new beings (exactly what was supposedly being done at that time in the URSS, with the \\"soviet man\\"). Others highlight the glimpses of Soviet society that \\"Heart of a dog\\" allows us to have, and think that the aim of the author was to give the reader at least an idea of what it was like to live in the URSS at that time...<br /><br />These few possible interpretations don't exclude others, so read this book and find them!!.

Yevgeny  Zamyatin (1884-1937) wrote \\"We\\" in 1920, in an URSS that was just beginning to show its true nature. He was able to observe at first hand the consequences of the expansion of the State and the Party, and the corresponding erosion of the value of the individual. The author called \\"We\\" his \\"most jesting and most serious work\\", and I think the reader will be able to appreciate both aspects of this peculiar book.<br /><br />This novel takes place in the future, where the One State is ruled by the great Benefactor, and separated from the rest of the world by a Great Wall, that doesn't allow the outside world to \\"contaminate\\" it. The citizens of the One State aren't persons but merely numbers. They have almost no privacy, due to the fact that most things are made of a material similar to glass but much more resistant. In any case that isn't a problem, because as everybody does the same things at the same time, nobody has much to hide.<br /><br />The One State begins to build a spaceship, the \\"Integral\\", that will be used to conquer other worlds and show them to be happy, in the way the citizens of the One State are happy. But how exactly are they happy?. Well, they have a rational happiness that can be mathematically proved. To mantain that happiness, they must always follow some rules. For example, there is no place for spontaneity in the One State. Imagination is considered a disease, and all art and poetry must be at the service of the State. The function of poetry is clear: \\"Today, poetry is no longer the idle, impudent whistling of a nightingale; poetry is civic service, poetry is useful\\".<br /><br />As if that weren't enough, almost all activities are organized according to the Table of Hours: \\"Every morning, with six-wheeled precision, at the same hour and the same moment, we -millions of us- get up as one. At the same hour, in million-headed unison, we start work; and in million-headed unison we end it. And, fused into a single million-handed body, at the same second, designated by the Table, we lift our spoons to our mouths.\\"<br /><br />That main character in \\"We\\" is D-503, an important mathematician who is also a faithful follower of the great Benefactor, and a key participant in the building of the \\"Integral\\". He starts to write a journal, to allow other less fortunate societies to learn from the way things are done in the One State. This novel is that journal...<br /><br />D-503 believes, at the beginning of this book, that the state of things in the One State is wonderful, and considers himself fortunate for being able to live in such enlightened times, where \\"¨everyone¨ and ¨I¨ are a single ¨We¨\\". But the unexpected happens when he starts to \\"fall in love\\" (an alien concept) with a number that has strange ideas, I-330. She makes D-503 start to question everything he had until then given for granted, and due to her he starts to develop a dangerous illness: a soul. As a consequence of that, D-503 cannot feel anymore as part of the whole, of \\"We\\", he cannot be merely a part of the whole...<br /><br />D-503's inner turmoil is shown to us throughout the pages of his journal, and it is rather heartbreaking how much he suffers when he can't return to his previous state of certitude. If at the beginning of the story he was consistently logical, and used a lot of mathematical metaphores, as chapters go by the reader begins to notice a certain incoherence. That inconsistency probably has to do with the fact that D-503 no longer understands himself, because he has been deprived of certitudes that he considered essential in defining himself (\\"I have long ceased to understand who ¨They¨ are, who are ¨We¨ \\"). Before, he didn't exist as anything else that as a part of the State. After I-330's pernicious influence, he begins to suspect that things might not be so simple.<br /><br />There are many themes present in \\"We\\", for example love, obsession, betrayal, freedom, the purpose of art and poetry, different kinds ofrevolutions, perfection, chaos... I haven't told you about many other interesting things I deem worth commenting about this book, but I think you will take greater advantage if you read \\"We\\" by yourself.<br /><br />Zamyatin's book is a good science-fiction novel AND a dystopia. One of the many meaning of dystopia is a work that describes a state of things that is possible but not ideal. Its value lays, in my opinion, not in the likelihood that what it tells us will eventually happen, but rather in the fact that by deforming or satirizing reality it allows the reader to see it from another perspective. From my point of view, this novel is a classic, and has the distinct advantage of being both entertaining and easy to read. If you can, read it soon!!. I highly recommend it :)<br /><br />Belen Alcatmany other interesting things I deem worth commenting about this book, but I think you will take greater advantage if you read \\"We\\" by yourself.

Its value lays, in my opinion, not in the likelihood that what it tells us will eventually happen, but rather in the fact that by deforming or satirizing reality it allows the reader to see it from another perspective. From my point of view, this novel is a classic, and has the distinct advantage of being both entertaining and easy to read. If you can, read it soon!!. I highly recommend it :)    Belen Alcat	2004-08-09

Eric Arthur Blair was an important English writer that you probably already know by the pseudonym of George Orwell. He wrote quite a few books, but many believe that his more influential ones were \\"Animal farm\\" (1944) and \\"1984\\" (1948).In those two books he conveyed, metaphorically and not always obviously, what Soviet Russia meant to him.<br /><br />I would like to make some comments about the second book, \\"1984\\". That book was written near his death, when he was suffering from tuberculosis, what might have had a lot to do with the gloominess that is one of the essential characteristics of \\"1984\\". The story is set in London, in a nightmarish 1984 that for Orwell might well have been a possibility, writting as he was many years before that date. Or maybe, he was just trying to warn his contemporaries of the dangers of not opposing the Soviet threat, a threat that involved a new way of life that was in conflict with all that the English held dear.<br /><br />Orwell tried to depict a totalitarian state, where the truth didn't exist as such, but was merely what the \\"Big Brother\\" said it was. Freedom was only total obedience to the Party, and love an alien concept, unless it was love for the Party. The story is told from the point of view of Winston Smith, a functionary of the Ministry of Truth whose work involved the \\"correction\\" of all records each time the \\"Big Brother\\" decided that the truth had changed. The Party slogan said that \\"Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past\\", and they applied it constantly by \\"bringing up to date\\" the past so as to make it coincide with whatever the Party wanted.<br /><br />From Winston Smith's point of view, many things that scare us are normal. For example, the omnipresence of the \\"Big Brother\\", always watching you, and the \\"Thought Police\\" that punishes treacherous thoughts against the Party. The reader feels the inevitability of doom that pervades the book many times, in phrases like \\"Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed forever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you\\".<br /><br />Little by little, Winston begins to realize that things are not right, and that they should change. We accompany him in his attempt at subversion, and are unwilling witnesses of what that attempt brings about. This book is marked by hopelessness, but at the same time it is the kind of distressing book we all NEED to read...<br /><br />Why do we need to read \\"1984\\"?. In my opinion, basically for two reasons. To start with, Orwell made in this book many observations that are no more merely fiction, but already things that manage to reduce our freedom. Secondly, and closelly linked to my first reason, this is a book that only gets better with the passing of time, as you can read in it more and more implications. One of Orwell's main reasons for writting this \\"negative utopia\\" might have been to warn his readers against communism, but many years after his death and the fall of communism, we can also interpret it as a caution against the excessive power of mass media, or the immoderate power of any government (even those who don't defend communism).<br /><br />Technological innovation should be at the service of men, and allow them to live better lives, but it can be used against them. I guess that is one of Orwell's lessons, probably the most important one. All in all, I think you can benefit from reading this book. Because of that, I highly recommend it to you :)<br /><br />Belen Alcathoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed forever.

US	50950064	R1FOP2IRWRT9PA	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	7	9	N	N	I prefer happy endings, but I still recommend this book ...	A good plot plus an engaging writing style make a bestseller. Sometimes, those elements are combined with a third: the story makes us think about ourselves, and life in general. It's only then that we have a classic...<br /><br /> In my opinion, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is just that, a classic. It was first published in 1925, an the author set the background of the story in the 1920's, the &quot;Jazz Age&quot;. Disregarding the fact that particular period of history is already distant, this book has managed to mantain its edge.<br /><br /> But why does that happen?. The plot is interesting, but nothing out of the ordinary. It is the story of Jay Gatsby, a poor man who fell in love with a rich young girl named Daisy, who ended up getting married to someone who had as much money as her parents. All that happened before the beginning of the story, that starts quite a few years after that marriage. Daisy is quite unhappy (in a rather superficial way), and ready for a change when Gatsby enters again into her life, as good-looking as ever but with much more money.<br /><br /> The story is told from the point of view of Nick Carraway, who is Daisy's cousin and who happens to meet Gatsby in one of the party the later organizes. Nick is a catalyst in the story, due to the fact that he puts Daisy and Jay in contact again after many years of separation. However, and more important, Carraway makes the book remarkably more interesting for the reader, making commentaries from time to time regarding what is happening. In the book, Nick says &quot;Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known&quot;.<br /><br /> At the very least, Nick's role is an effective way that Fitzgerald found of involving the reader a little bit more in what's happening in the story. Most people can identify with Nick Carraway because he doesn't go to the extremes where the other characters permanently are. Gatsby, and his relentless persecution of a love that never was, that can end in nothing else that pure tragedy... And Daisy, so frivolous and vain, so thoroughly engrossed in herself that is incapable of true love...<br /><br /> All in all, I liked the story, but I especially enjoyed the way in which F. Scott Fitzgerald writes. His style is very simple, with only some metaphores that don't obscure the meaning but help to make it clear. He is also quite concise, as evident from the fact that this book has little more that 200 pages.<br /><br /> I think it is probably wortwhile to point out that what really makes this book a classic, instead of merely an enjoyable book (not that there is anything wrong with those!!), is the fact that it deals with many themes all of us deem important, for example love, dreams, lies, justice, social differences, hate, money and what it can (and cannot) buy...<br /><br /> From my point of view, this book is more than worth your time and money. I only wish the ending had been different... The book would have lost some of its dramatic air, but I would have been happier. Even though I know it is rather silly, I prefer happy endings. I hope you notice that despite that, I still recommend &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; to you. I really don't have other choice, because it is really a great book :)<br /><br /> Belen Alcatersecution of a love that never was, that can end in nothing else that pure tragedy...

Kaplan believes that our modern world is merely a continuation of the ancient world in many things, and thus capable of taking advantage of lessons already taught by important philosophers and statesmen. There is a quotation at the beginning of this book, near to the title, that somehow sums up Kaplan's idea: &quot;Anyone wishing to see what it is to be must consider what has been: all the things of this world in every era have their counterparts in ancient times&quot; (Machiavelli).<br /><br /> The author delves in an engaging way into the works of Thucydides, Livy, Machiavelli, Hobbes and Churchill, among others. He draws &quot;lessons&quot; from their works, and tries to apply them to the events that were happening in the world more or less at the time this book was first published (2002).<br /><br /> Do you want an example?. Well, for instance Kaplan reminds the reader that Machiavelli said that a policy is virtuous only if it is effective, and he also tells us about the distinction that author made between private virtue and pagan virtue. According to Machiavelli, pagan virtue (pragmatic and merciless, but not amoral) was the kind of virtue that should prevail in matters of the State. After this &quot;theoretic&quot; travel, Kaplan applies the lessons we learn to current affairs... He does this with all the philosophers or statesmen he studies, and it is at that point that I generally don't like his conclusions.<br /><br /> All the same, I want to highlight the fact that I found some of his observations strikingly accurate, especially those regarding military strategy. Kaplan says that even though many believe that war will become more &quot;clean&quot; and less dangerous for the &quot;professional soldiers&quot; thanks to technology, that will not always be the case. In some occasions, professional soldiers will have to face &quot;warriors&quot; who have nothing to lose, and who think in a totally different way. From Kaplan's point of view, USA's strategy will have to adjust to that truth with &quot;warrior politics&quot;, because that is a reality that cannot be denied any longer.<br /><br /> Robert Kaplan is far from being an author with whom I agree on everything... As a matter of fact, I dislike many of the conclusions he reaches in &quot;Warrior politics&quot;. I think that he ends up placing too much emphasis on the role of force in the international arena, and doesn't give its due importance to &quot;soft power&quot;.<br /><br /> Despite that, I don't regret buying this book, because Kaplan makes some points I consider quite interesting. Also, and probably more important, I was so much against some of the statements he made that I ended up thinking why I believed that those statements weren't true. Due to that, now I am more certain of my opinions, and have quite a few reasons to back them.<br /><br /> On the whole, I think that this is the kind of book that &quot;shakes&quot; you, whether you agree with it or not. As a result, it is thought-provoking, and a book I have no problems recommending to you :)<br /><br /> Belen Alcata totally different way.

Schumpeter reached the conclusion that capitalism wouldn't be able to survive, due to diverse characteristics that were intrinsic to it. For example, he thought that monopolistic practices would only increase with time, thus damaging the capitalist process and not allowing it to function smoothly.<br /><br />Obviously, by now we have realized that his conclusion was inexact, but that doesn't mean that we should overlook *Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy*. Schumpeter's analysis of capitalism and socialism, his concept of *creative destruction* and his economic definition of democracy are only some of the things included in this book that should be taken into account. Perhaps reality didn't end up matching the premises the author adhered to, but all the same we are likely to learn a lot from the valid points he makes along the way.<br /><br />Schumpeter's draws the arguments to support his ideas from different fields: Economy, Sociology, History, and even (sometimes) Psychology. Because of that his premises don't tend to be unidimensional, but rather take into account the different facets of reality. As a result, this book is much more interesting to read, even though it might seem somehow difficult at first to many readers.<br /><br />The interesting ideas in *Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy* are many, and I can't tell you about all of them without making this review impossibly long. Despite that, I can tell you at least something regarding the notions that I consider more interesting, for example the well-explained notion that *creative destruction* is the essence of capitalism. Also, I think that it is worthwhile to highlight Schumpeter's economic definition of the democratic method, as an *institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people's vote*.<br /><br />On the whole, I think you will enormously appreciate this landmark book, if you enjoy a good and careful analysis and aren't easily scared by books that at first glance seem too difficult. Provided you persist, you will realize that this book is as easy to tackle as many others... The only difference is that after reading *Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy* you will know a lot more, something that not so many other books can offer :)<br /><br />Belen Alcatll enormously appreciate this landmark book, if you enjoy a good and careful analysis and aren't easily scared by books that at first glance seem too difficult.

In my opinion, H. D. F. Kitto fulfilled his self-imposed task marvelously.<br /><br /> Kitto doesn't pretend to write an exhaustive history of Ancient Greece, but rather an introductory book that touches upon many subjects without delving too much into any of them. As a result, after reading this book you will end up with a general idea of the culture, art, literature and historical facts regarding Ancient Greece, but you won't be able to say you know all about it. On the other hand, you will know much more about the Greeks, and the values that shaped them and motivated their actions. That is probably more than enough to recommend this book :)<br /><br /> I want to point out that even though the author doesn't oversimplify the subject at hand to the point of distorting it, he highlights so much certain central ideas that even those who read the book without paying it due attention will understand them. For instance, Kitto emphasizes the great divide that existed for the Greeks between themselves and the others, the barbarians. According to the Greeks, that divide was undeniable because only they had mastered the way of being truly &quot;free&quot;. That certitude, and their consequent feeling of exceptionalism, marked all their actions.<br /><br /> Kitto says, in the introduction, that he strove to allow the Greeks to speak for themselves, and the reader gets exactly that impression from time to time. I don't know much about Ancient Greece, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I guess that is a good indication that even those who just want to dabble in the subject are likely to enjoy it...<br /><br /> I believe that &quot;The Greeks&quot; is a very well-written book, something that combined with the fact that it isn't overly long makes it the kind of reading material that almost everybody might be interested in. All in all, I highly recommend this book to you :)<br /><br /> Belen Alcatthe kind of reading material that almost everybody might be interested in.

The main point in Weber's *The Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism* is that the Protestant ethic helped to shape values favorable to the birth of capitalism. Despite that, the author isn't a cultural determinist because he takes care to point out that values help to shape an outcome, but don't produce it for certain.<br /><br /> This book is quite interesting, and includes lots of interesting observations regarding Weber's main premise, despite not being overly long. For instance, the author says that due to the fact that Protestant ethic viewed hard work as a duty and looked down on excesive luxuries, Protestants were indirectly encouraged to save almost all the money they earnt, thus increasing the funds available for the capitalist process. Of course, there are many more examples that contribute to give weight to Weber's argument, but to know more you will need to read *The protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism* ...<br /><br /> Weber analyses some data at his disposal, and that makes some chapters slightly less engaging. Notwithstanding that, this book is likely to be worth your time and your money. To start with, you will learn quite a few interesting facts you probably were unaware of before. Secondly, and in a more frivolous vein, you will finally know what everybody is talking about when they mention directly or indirectly this book from time to time :)<br /><br /> All in all, I recommend this book especially to those interested in Sociology or Cultural Studies, but also to curious people who want to know more about the influence of culture in different processes. Enjoy it !<br /><br /> Belen Alcat	2004-07-29

Barrow answers these questions and many more in a little book of 224 pages, that somehow manages to provide the reader not only a great deal of information but also entertaining reading material.<br /><br />  'Romans' isn't a profound study of exactly how Romans contributed to literature, jurisprudence, architecture, or what were the characteristics of their daily life. Notwithstanding that, it allows us to learn a little bit of all that, motivating the reader to go on reading about the diverse subjects.<br /><br />  According to Barrow, the Romans built a different kind of Empire, one inspired by a law that they created, and imposed on themselves. The author follows the process from the early days to the fall of the Empire, taking especial care to point out the clash between new and old habits, and how that made an impact on the kind of Empire Rome was. Of course, that is only part of what 'Romans' is about: it also allows you to understand what pietas, humanitas, libertas, mores, auctoritas, fides, severitas, gravitas and constantia meant for the Roman citizen, thus giving you at least a glimpse of his soul.<br /><br />  In my opinion, this book is especially noteworthy because it aims to explain what kind of men were behind the greatness of Rome, therefore looking at the issue from the right point of view. History is made by men, and you can only understand it if you at least try to learn what motivated them at a given time. Barrow knew this, and tried to share it with us. For that, I heartily recommend this book to you :)<br /><br />  Belen Alcat	2004-07-26

Krasner calls into question the nowadays widespread idea that sovereignty is being eroded by different factors (for example, globalization). He points out that, as a matter of fact, the term *sovereignty* has multiple meanings. Ignoring that can be remarkably problematic, because it doesn?t allow us to analyze adequately such an essential concept as sovereignty...<br /><br />  The author says that the term sovereignty is used mainly in four ways. International legal sovereignty refers to the practices that have to do with mutual recognition, while Westphalian sovereignty has to do with *political organization based on the exclusion of external actors from authority structures within a given territory*. Domestic sovereignty refers to the *formal organization of political authority within the state* and the ability of rulers to exercise control within it. Lastly, Interdependence sovereignty takes into account the way in which public authorities regulate the flow of people, information, capital and ideas across the borders of the state.<br /><br />  The different kinds of sovereignty don?t always go together, and can change at different paces. In this book Krasner concentrates on studying International legal sovereignty and Westphalian sovereignty, seeking to show us how they apply in the international system. According to him, those two kinds of sovereignty are good examples of organized hypocrisy, because they are recognized but not always respected. For instance, Westphalian sovereignty (based on the exclusion of external actors) has been violated repeatedly, and several motives (for example minority rights, fiscal responsibility and international security) have been used as pretexts to do so.<br /><br />  Krasner says that *In the international system, no institutional arrangement, including international legal and Westphalian sovereignty, can be taken for granted. A logic of consequences can always prevail over a logic of appropriateness*. He gives quite a number of valid reasons why this happens, and a lot of examples taken from history that help the reader to understand why *organized hypocrisy* pervades in the international system in matters that have to do with sovereignty.<br /><br />  *Sovereignty: Organized Hypocrisy* is certainly not perfect (it tends to be a little repetitive). Despite that, this is the kind of book you won?t regret buying. Why?. I will try to explain that with an example. If you like to read the newspapers, you probably have already noticed that sometimes, in the international realm, actions have nothing to do with the principles that are supposedly recognized and respected by all the states. Stephen D. Krasner tries to explain, at least in part, why that happens...I think he succeeds marvelously, and because of that I strongly recommend this book to you.<br /><br />  Belen Alcatof valid reasons why this happens, and a lot of examples taken from history that help the reader to understand why *organized hypocrisy* pervades in the international system in matters that have to do with sovereignty.           *Sovereignty: Organized Hypocrisy* is certainly not perfect (it tends to be a little repetitive).

How does USA react when it is attacked on its own soil?. How does it deal with the knowledge that it is vulnerable, and that others can shatter its security?. Yale?s professor  John Lewis Gaddis tries to answer these questions and a few more in this small but interesting essay...<br /><br />The author studies the different ways in which USA has reacted throughout history, when its security has been breached. For example, he mentions the burning of Washington of 1814, and the Pearl Harbour attack of 1941. He points out that different strategies were conceived in those occasions in order to deal with the unexpected. On the one hand, the 1814 attack led to a strategy based on preemption, unilateralism and hegemony. But on the other hand, the attack on Pearl Harbour resulted in a rather diverse security policy, based on multilateralism.<br /><br />Thanks to the fact that professor Lewis makes us remember our history lessons, we realize that the post 9/11 strategy applied by the Bush Administration has strong roots in the past, beginning in 1814. However, thanks to *Surprise, security and the American Experience*, we notice that American leaders also have other options, for example an strategy that gives its due importance to multilateralism, like the one Roosevelt employed after Pearl Harbour.<br /><br />The author tries to reflect on the September 11 events, and what they meant for America. He shows those events as another instance in which USA?s security was shattered, and that motivated a reaction that had noteworthy effects on America?s *grand strategy*. Lewis wants to understand the implications of what happened, because even though it is remarkably more difficult to be accurate when studying recent events, it is important to do so if those events are essential turning points in history. He says that *We act in the present with a view to shaping the future only on the basis of what we know from the past. So we might as well try to know our recent history as best we can, however imperfect the exercise may be*.<br /><br />On the whole, I think that this is a book that won?t make you lose your time. Even though it has only 116 pages and it is quite easy to read, it has a lot of useful information regarding USA?s past and present. In my opinion this is almost *obligatory reading material* for those who want to form an opinion regarding USA?s current *grand strategy*, and to know more about its security policy. After all, is there a better way of grasping the implications of what is happening in the present than studying the past?.<br /><br />Belen Alcatthe exercise may be*.

He believed that some worrying tendencies could be observed in the England society of his time, and tried to warn others about them.<br />The author basically explains his ideas regarding the preservation of individual liberties, not only due to the fact that they are rights owed to everyone, but also because they benefit society as a whole.<br />For example, when he says that liberty of thought and of discussion must be preserved, he tells us that &quot;Wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and argument: but fact and arguments, to produce any effect on the mind, must be brought before it&quot;. How can mistaken beliefs or actions be proven wrong, if dissent is forbidden?. The loss for society is clear: &quot;If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error&quot;.<br />In order to preserve the liberties included in the concept of Civil Liberty, the author points out that there must be limits to the action of the Government. He says that &quot;The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others&quot;. Any other reason is simply not good enough. Thus, Stuart Mill highlights the rights of the individual, but also the limit to those rights: the well-being of others.<br />&quot;On Liberty&quot; is not too long, and I think you are highly likely to enjoy it, if you can get past the first few pages. The problem is that even though the ideas in this book are quite modern, the language is somehow dated. But then, we must remember that &quot;On Liberty&quot; was written a long time ago...<br />Notwithstanding that, do your best to read the first pages, and you will realize that after a while it will be much easier.

This exchange of letters began in 1903 thanks to a missive that Franz Xaver Kappus sent to R. M. Rilke, and continued for many years, until 1908.<br /><br /> Why is this little book important?. Because it allows us to read what Rilke thought about many subjects, for example life, poetry, and art. And because, as F. X. Kappus said, \\"when a prince is going to speak, silence must be made\\".<br /><br /> Kappus wanted to share the insights that Rilke gave him, and thus compiled his missives in \\"Letters to a young poet\\". The letters are few, and not overly long, but in this case the knowledge offered is certainly greater than the number of pages.<br /><br /> It is easier to show you what I mean by giving you an example... For instance, what Rilke's advices Franz to do, when he tells him to: \\"Go into yourself and test the deeps in which your life takes rise; at its source you will find the answer to the question whether you must create. Accept it, just as it sounds, without inquiring into it. Perhaps it will turn out that you are called to be an artist\\".<br /><br /> On the whole, I highly recommend this book to everybody. It will probably be more useful to aspiring writers, but people who simply enjoy literature will delight in it too :)<br /><br /> Belen Alcat	2004-07-06

Some writers believe that they have to begin their books with an unexpected phrase in order to &quot;trap&quot; the reader from the very first page. Obviously, Kagan is one of them.<br /><br /> He begins &quot;Of Paradise and Power&quot; by saying that &quot;It is time to stop pretending that Europeans and Americans share a common view of the world, or even that they occupy the same world&quot;. Of course, that is a striking phrase, that arrests our attention and produces a vivid impression on the reader... But is there something else to this book that some colorful phrases?.<br /><br /> I must say that yes, fortunately there is more to &quot;Of Paradise and Power&quot; than that. Even for those who, like me, don't agree with Kagan's conclusions, it is interesting to learn what &quot;the other side&quot; thinks, specially when it is expressed in such an articulate way. Robert Kagan is a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a well-known exponent of neoconservatism. Due to the importance that neoconservatism has nowadays, I believe that it is essential to know what one of its advocates thinks regarding the relations between America and Europe.<br /><br /> To start with, Kagan says that what divides Europe and USA is the question of power. They have different points of view regarding the matter, and thus differing strategic perspectives. The reasons for that are not only diverse material capabilities, but also contrasting historical experiences.<br /><br /> According to the author, it is true that Americans have a tendency towards unilateralism in international affairs, but that is simply a consequence of their strength. Europeans favor multilateralism and diplomacy now not because they are more committed than USA to some ideals, but because they are afraid of USA's power due to the fact that they are weak. They also think that USA's frequent use of military force only perpetuates a Hobbessian world where they are vulnerable. Kagan says that, for them, &quot;The United States may be a relatively bening hegemon but insofar as its actions delay the arrival of a world order more conducive to the safety of weaker powers, it is objectively dangerous&quot;.<br /><br /> The author points out that there is something that Europe doesn't take into account when it criticizes USA's use of power: that same power is the one that protects Europe from the threats of &quot;the outside&quot;. Europe has managed to achieve a &quot;paradise&quot; on earth, but their paradise depends on USA not entering into it, due to the fact that somebody has to protect Europe from the countries that still believe in power politics.<br /><br /> Kagan also predicts that the relations between Europe and USA aren't likely to improve, unless Europe can get over its fear and anger at USA's strength (remembering that it is necessary for them), and USA can show at least a &quot;decent respect for the opinion of mankind&quot;, acting unilaterally only when it is strictly necessary.<br /><br /> All in all, I think this book is quite a good choice for those who want to know more about America's foreign policy, whether they share Kagan's convictions or not. Don't expect a balanced view of the issue at hand, but be prepared to read the arguments of one of the sides in the current discussion, presented in a clear way.<br /><br /> Disregarding what side you take in the ongoing debate, you will surely benefit from this short but thought-provoking book...

Most of us have heard many theories about the reasons that lead to the fall of the Soviet Empire. But there is a factor that hasn`t been overly well examined, and that is the role played by nationalism in that event. Did nationalism play a noteworthy part in bringing down the URSS?. There are few clear answers to this question, at least until you read \\"La Gloire des nations\\".<br /><br /> Helene Carrere d`Encausse, the author of this book, is a well-known French writer who has written remarkably good books regarding the Soviet Empire and Russia. In \\"La Gloire des nations\\" she examines some characteristics of the Empire, and the crisis in the different republics of the URSS that lead to the final rupture of the links between them and the central power.<br /><br /> According to Carrere d`Encausse, nationalism had been repressed successfully for a long time in the URSS, and force had been used remorselessly when it was considered necessary. However, even though they were forced to silence, the conquered nations didn`t resign themselves to their new destiny as part of something bigger, that should be considered more important than them. They waited, until the moment came when they couldn`t keep quiet any more. That happened in the mid- 1980`s...<br /><br /> Despite the fact that the URSS had seemed from the outside a fairly homogeneous bloc, the differences were there, merely waiting to explode. The \\"soviet people\\" were, first of all, people who belonged to different nations, some oppressed, and others (like Russia) with a place of privilege in the existing order... The Empire`s population had different religions and languages, diverse pasts and contrasting ideas regarding the future. The central power tried to ignore all this, and continued to do so until it was too late: the Age of nations had arrived.<br /><br /> All in all, I highly recommend this book to people interested in nationalism, Russian History and History in general. What is more, I think that those who like to read books in French will enormously appreciate this book too, because the author`s style is not only elegant but also engaging. Carrere d`Encausse helps the reader to learn more about Russian History, giving him an added gift: the way in which she writes.<br /><br /> Belen Alcatke to read books in French will enormously appreciate this book too, because the author`s style is not only elegant but also engaging.

As you already know, \\"The Well of Lost Plots\\" is the 3rd book in the \\"Thursday Next\\" series. After reading the first two awesome books in the series, you might think that there is no way the author can surprise you again... However, if you were to think that you would be very wrong, because Jasper Fforde does it again :)<br /><br /> At the end of \\"Lost in a good book\\" we left Thursday pregnant, with a husband eradicated at the age of two, and followed by the Goliath Corporation (who wanted her skills to jump into books). She was in urgent need of a hiding place, at least until her son was born and she could begin again her efforts to un-eradicate her husband. As a consequence, she decided to \\"get lost in a good book\\", more specifically in a B novel in the Well of Lost Plots, in order to get some deserved rest.<br /><br /> Did I say rest?. Well, at least that is what she expected to get, but with her temporary job at Jurisfiction, an assassin killing Jurisfiction agents and grammasites all over the place, getting some rest won`t be easy. On top of all that, Thursday must face the very real risk that \\"Caversham Heights\\" (the B novel where she is staying for a year thanks to the Character Exchange Program) will be scraped, and deal with an enemy that she thought was left behind in the \\"real\\" world: Aornis Hades.<br /><br /> As you can see, the \\"Well of Lost Plots\\" is likely to be everything but boring... You will meet again some old friends (for example Miss Havisham), and get to know new ones. But beware: there is a traitor among the people Thursday knows and likes. And where is Godot?. Why doesn`t he appear?.<br /><br /> I want to point out that I loved the introduction of the generic characters who lived with Thursday, \\"ibb\\" and \\"obb\\", who later won the right to use capital letters, thus becoming \\"Ibb\\" and \\"Obb\\", and who went to school in order to become characters in different books. They are... different, but charming :)<br /><br /> Fforde goes on introducing unexpected things, for example a footnote system that works not only as a radio, but also as cellular phones that allow everybody to listen to private conversations. I liked the misspelling \\"vyrus\\", and the idea that in order to contain it many dictionaries were needed, but I hated what happened to one of the characters because of an incident involving that \\"vyrus\\".<br /><br /> I probably could go on and on writing about \\"The Well of Lost Plots\\", because I loved it, and there are really lots of things to be said about it. However, I think that it is better to allow you to discover the rest, because if I don`t let you do that I would be depriving you of a wonderful pleasure...<br /><br /> I recommend this book to all those who love literature and will appreciate casual and pertinent allusions to well-known books and characters, but also to those who just enjoy an innovative and appealing fantasy book.

Why?. Simply because it influenced many people, and motivated many events: it made a difference...<br />&quot;Utopia&quot; means, literally, &quot;no place&quot;. The word didn't exist until More coined it in this book. He wanted to make a critic regarding the English society of his time, but needed to cloak it under a &quot;fictional&quot; mantle due to censure. Displeasing the king was very dangerous in More's time...<br />What is this short novel about?. Well, More introduces us to an imaginary character, Raphael Hythloday, a traveler that has visited a distant country: Utopia. After meeting More, Raphael tells him about the country he visited, and afterwards More writes a book about what he was told.<br />To begin with, in that country community is more important that private aims, and that fact permeates all social and political life. There is no private propriety of the means of production, and everything belongs to everybody. Work is obligatory to all healthy men and women, and those who want to do nothing are punished with forced labor. There is no money, but everybody has what is needed to live well, although frugally. Thanks to the fact labor is well distributed, leisure time is available to all. As a result, men and women (equals in this society) can dedicate time to cultivate their minds...<br />Other important points that should be highlighted regarding Utopia, especially because they contrast strongly with the situation of More's England, are that in this country all religions are allowed, and that there isn't an autocratic rule (a democratically elected assembly and different local governments are elected). All in all, equality prevails, and thanks to the above mentioned arrangements harmony is achieved.<br />&quot;Utopia&quot; was written a few years later that Machiavelli's &quot;The Prince&quot;, but the differences between the two books are incredible. In &quot;Utopia&quot; instead of praising the power of princes More wanted to show clearly all that was wrong in English society because it was governed by a bad ruler. He didn't tell others to face reality: he asked them to criticize it, in order to improve it later. Thus, Moro established the essential traits of what was later known as the &quot;utopian method&quot;: to describe in other situation, with a prejudice of optimism, all that that we don't like in our society.<br />With &quot;Utopia&quot; Moro created a new way to mobilize energies, and showed options that had remained hidden from the eyes of those who weren't happy with their societies. Behind the name of &quot;fiction&quot;, he gave politics new intruments of discussion, and opened to it novel ways of considering reality, in the light of what could/should be.<br />There is no politics without the idea that something better can be achieved, without the kind of imagination that allows us to think that something better is possible. Moro made that evident... I think that that is more than enough to strongly recommend this book to you  :)<br />Belen Alcate incredible.

Same place (an old castle), different times, interlinked stories of lovers, Kundera himself, and a multitude of carefully described peripheral characters that somehow complete the story behind the stories. All that, in a book of merely 176 pages?<br /><br /> However, there is much more to &quot;Slowness&quot;, because the real protagonist of this short novel is time, and its nature. Kundera makes some interesting observations that are quite true, from my point of view. He points out the connection between slowness and pleasure on the one hand, and slowness and memory on the other. It is fairly evident that he wants to make us think about the dangers of the speed that seems to characterize our modern society. Where are we headed?. And is it worth the price we will have to pay?.<br /><br /> Is this book for everybody?. Certainly not: there are some scenes with sexual content that are inappropriate for very young readers, and that older readers might find distasteful. Despite that, I believe that many people will like &quot;Slowness&quot;, mainly due to the fact that the novel is undisputedly original, with an erratic charm all of its own. The story wanders from one character to the other and from our days to the distant past with an almost perfect inconsistency that hides an omnipresent connecting factor: time.<br /><br /> All in all, I think that those who are fond of the strikingly unusual will enormously enjoy this book, but only if they are able to pay little attention to the defects in &quot;Slowness&quot; in order to concentrate on what makes it worth reading.<br /><br /> Belen Alcat	2004-06-13

Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which book paper catches fire, and starts to burn... Why on earth would you want to know that? . Because that is extremely important in this book, due to the fact that its main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman. However, he is not a fireman in the way we now understand that word: a man that tries to stop fires. Here, firemen burn books.<br /><br /> Bradbury tells us about a place where books are forbidden: nobody can read them, or have them, without committing a crime. The authorities consider that they are dangerous, and because of that they make firemen burn them, and the houses where they were.<br /><br /> Everything changes for Montag due to two things. To begin with, he gets to know Clarisse, a young girl that makes him see life from another perspective. Secondly, one day the unexpected happens: he cannot help but read a line of a book he was burning. Of course, Montag gets curious, and as a result, he steals some books, and decides to read them.<br /><br /> That causes him many problems, as he begins to put into question things he took for guaranteed before. With the help of Faber, and old former professor who still remembers how things were before books were forbidden, Montag starts to think about a way to change things... Will he be able to do that?. I don?t want to give away more about the book, so read it and you will know :)<br /><br /> It is worthwhile to point out that &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is a beautiful story, so wonderfully written that it is very easy to read. Notwithstanding that, I believe that the more important aspect of this book is that it is a good way to remember why we like books so much, and what a privilege it is to be able to have them.<br /><br /> Thanks to Bradbury?s imaginary dystopia we realize once again that something that Heinrich Heine said is true: &quot;It is there, where they burn books, that eventually they burn people too&quot; (&quot;Dort, wo man Bucher Verbrennt, verbrennt man auch am, Ende Menschen&quot;).

Ruy Castro shows us how the Bossa Nova started (\\"A hist&oacute;ria\\" = the story), but he also introduces the reader to the lives of the musicians who \\"made\\" the Bossa Nova (\\"as hist&oacute;rias\\" = the stories), for example Joao Gilberto,Tom Jobim, Vinicius de Moraes and Sylvia Telles, among others...<br /><br />When we read \\"Chega de saudade\\" we are told Bossa Nova's story as if it were a tale: we get to know important facts about that movement, but also entertaining gossip regarding the people who were part of it. Reading this book is quite easy, and you will find that the author makes you smile from time to time with his ironic commentaries. Due to the fact that this is the original version in Portuguese, you won't miss the subtle nuances of meaning that sometimes are lost in the English translation, and you will be able to take delight in several wordplays that Ruy Castro makes throughout the book.<br /><br />On the whole, I highly recommend \\"Chega de saudade\\". I give it 5 stars, because I think it is a perfect example of an entertaining but useful book regarding the history of an important movement in Brazilian music. I particularly love this book because I think that it adds a \\"human dimension\\" to Bossa Nova. I like to enjoy the songs, but also to know about the lives of those who wrote them, and what inspired the creators regarding each particular song...<br /><br />Of course, this book by itself is not enough: you will need to learn more, and listen to the songs \\"Chega de saudade\\" talks about. But where can you find a book that exhausts a subject?. I haven't been that lucky yet, so I will gladly settle for one that allows me to start studying the subject, and that makes me more interested in it :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2004-06-11

I bought \\"The Bourne identity\\" mostly because I didn't want to lose the opportunity of reading Ludlum's book before the release of a film based on it. I really wasn't a fan of the author (and I am not one now), but I loved this book.<br /><br />To start with, the plot is remarkably good. \\"The Bourne identity\\" is the story of a man without a past, rescued from the Mediterranean Sea by some fishermen. He is very ill, and his body has suffered the impact of many bullets. The man is taken by the fishermen to a doctor in a nearby island, who helps him to recover physically and mentally. Our protagonist doesn't remember who he is, but with the help of the doctor he finds some clues he doesn't like too much. He only knows for certain some things, for instance that his face has been altered by plastic surgery, that he knows a lot about firearms and that he carried on him a microfilm that contains the code to an account of four million dollars.<br /><br />In the Swiss bank where the account is he also finds a name: Jason Bourne. But... is he Jason Bourne?. He cannot remember, and if it were for quite a few people, he won't. From the moment he leaves the island onwards, our man without a past will be followed, and attacked. He doesn't understand why, but he reacts in order to stay alive. Add to this already interesting mixture a woman he takes as a hostage, Marie, a number of assasins (including the most famous assassin in the world, Carlos), and the possibility that he is, as a matter of fact, also an assassin, and you will understand why this book is so good. The main character will be hunted all throughout the book not only by the \\"bad guys\\", but also by the \\"good\\" ones (mainly agents from the USA Government). You won't be able to stop reading this book, and you will find yourself asking aloud to nobody in particular \\"who on earth is this man?\\" and \\"what started this whole mess\\"?.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this book to those who appreciate a good thriller, and to those who don't usually read this kind of book but are open to new experiences. I belong to the last category, as I only read \\"The Bourne identity\\" because I was interested in watching the movie of the same name.<br /><br />By the way, I also recommend the movie (the 2002 version, with Matt Damon), that ended up bearing only a limited resemblance to the book. If I had to choose, I would choose the book without hesitation, but if you have the possibility not only of reading the book but also of watching the movie, do both things...

Thanks to Tolstoy's book, we get to know characters who sometimes seem so real that we cannot help but living with them the series of events that are recounted in this book.<br />Who are the main characters?. Well, we might begin by telling something about Anna Karenina, the woman who gives this book its title. Anna is someone who has found some satisfaction in a marriage to a husband she doesn't love. Her life isn't exciting, but she is comfortable, and has a son that means everything to her. Her world will be shaken when a nobleman, Count Vronsky, falls in love with her. He pursuits Anna until he convinces her to become his lover, indulging in an adulterous affair. But... will he go on loving her, even after she risks all for him?. And did she do the right thing, by following her heart without thinking about the consequences of her actions?.<br />There are many more characters, but I would like to highlight one of them: Levin. Levin is a rather eccentric gentleman farmer, who worries about things like the meaning of life, and allows the reader to share with him the kind of doubts that many have had, but few voice. He ends up finding happiness, but his path is not easy, especially because he is prone to reflect on issues that cause him anguish. His story is linked at the beginning of the book to that of Anna and Vronsky because the woman he loves, Kitty Shcherbatskaya, thinks she loves Vronsky. However, as the story advances, you will probably end up comparing Anna and Vronsky's relationship to that of Kitty and Levin. One is all drama, and passion; the other, calm and contentment. Which one is better?. And according to whom?.<br />I want to point out how well Tolstoy depicted 19th century Russian society, especially the differences between social classes and how much hypocrisy permeated the moral codes of polite society. If you pay close attention you will notice that several themes also to be found in other classics are recurrent in \\"Anna Karenina\\". One of them is fate, and some of the others are the omnipresence of death, the meaning of life, and the power of faith. There are many more things I would like to say about this book, but I think you will do better if you start to read \\"Anna Karenina\\" right now, instead of spending more of your time reading a long review such as this one :)<br />On the whole, I highly recommend this book.

Ruy Castro shows us how the Bossa Nova started (\\"A hist&oacute;ria\\" = the story), but he also introduces the reader to the lives of the musicians who \\"made\\" the Bossa Nova (\\"as hist&oacute;rias\\" = the stories), for example Joao Gilberto,Tom Jobim, Vinicius de Moraes and Sylvia Telles, among others...<br /><br />When we read \\"Chega de saudade\\" we are told Bossa Nova's story as if it were a tale: we get to know important facts about that movement, but also entertaining gossip regarding the people who were part of it. Reading this book is quite easy, and you will find that the author makes you smile from time to time with his ironic commentaries. Due to the fact that this is the original version in Portuguese, you won't miss the subtle nuances of meaning that sometimes are lost in the English translation, and you will be able to take delight in several wordplays that Ruy Castro makes throughout the book.<br /><br />On the whole, I highly recommend \\"Chega de saudade\\". I give it 5 stars, because I think it is a perfect example of an entertaining but useful book regarding the history of an important movement in Brazilian music. I particularly love this book because I think that it adds a \\"human dimension\\" to Bossa Nova. I like to enjoy the songs, but also to know about the lives of those who wrote them, and what inspired the creators regarding each particular song...<br /><br />Of course, this book by itself is not enough: you will need to learn more, and listen to the songs \\"Chega de saudade\\" talks about. But where can you find a book that exhausts a subject?. I haven't been that lucky yet, so I will gladly settle for one that allows me to start studying the subject, and that makes me more interested in it :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2004-06-01

After reading &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot;, the first book in Fforde?s &quot;Thursday Next&quot; series, I was delighted. I loved the characters, the premise of a different world where literature was such an encompassing passion, and the possibility some of the characters had of &quot;jumping into&quot; books, thus being able to interact with many personages from literature.<br /><br /> &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot; was witty, funny, easy to read, and enthralling: I could not have liked it more... But, as a result, I was somewhat afraid of reading its sequel, &quot;Lost in a good book&quot;. I asked myself how on earth could Fforde write another book as good as the first one. I really couldn?t imagine an answer, but thankfully my curiosity was stronger that my fear of finding the sequel not good enough.<br /><br /> &quot;Lost in a good book&quot; brings the same characters, but new situations, and developments that make the story richer. Spec-Ops 27 Thursday Next is now a celebrity, and she must deal with that, something that is quite difficult for her. As if that were not enough, the Goliath Corporation blackmails her into bringing back Mr. Schitt (trapped by Thursday in one of Poe?s poems in &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot;). As she is indifferent to the Corporation?s threats, and to the money it offers her, they eradicate her husband (at the age of two years) with the help of a corrupt Chronoguard, promising to bring him back once Schitt is returned. But how will Thursday do that, without the Prose Portal that previously helped her to jump into books?.<br /><br /> Thursday has more than enough problems in the &quot;real world&quot;, but she discovers quite soon that that is not all. She is accused by Jurisfiction of a &quot;fiction infraction&quot;, due to the fact that she accidentally changed the end of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. Jurisfiction, as the fictional lawyer assigned to her explains, is the service ran &quot;inside novels to maintain the integrity of popular fiction&quot;. Consequently, she will be prosecuted in Kafka?s &quot;The Trial&quot;. Sounds strange?. Stranger things will happen when Next becomes an apprentice to Miss Havisham (from &quot;Great Expectations&quot;), in order to become one of Jurisfiction?s agents.<br /><br /> This review is already too long, and I haven?t mentioned the difficulties surrounding the authentication of &quot;Cardenio&quot; (one of Shakespeare?s lost plays), the visits to other books (for example Austen?s &quot;Sense and sensibility&quot;), Pickwick?s egg (her pet Dodo is a &quot;she&quot;) or the fact that somebody is trying to kill Thursday through coincidences... Did I pointed out that Fforde goes on introducing literary devices that make the reader laugh?. I guess I will have to leave that, and many things more, for you to discover :)<br /><br /> On the whole, I can say that even if &quot;Lost in a good book&quot; is similar to &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot; in some aspects (characters, main premises), it continues to develop Fforde?s world, and doesn?t merely repeat the things that were already said in the first book. In my opinion, in this book we get to know more about Thursday and the people that surrounds her, but we also realize that there is much more to the fictional world that we had supposed. As a matter of fact, the &quot;fictional&quot; world and the &quot;real&quot; world are intrinsically connected, and Next is one of the links.<br /><br /> What can I say?. Read this book as soon as you can. You won?t regret it, and you are likely to do the same thing that I am doing right now. That is to say, you will wait anxiously for the next book in the series, and in the meanwhile you will recommend &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot; and &quot;Lost in a good book&quot; to others, so that they will know what they were missing without being aware of it :)<br /><br /> Belen Alcatly, she will be prosecuted in Kafka?s &quot;The Trial&quot;.

Distinctive, exceptional, extraordinary, particular, individual, unique, eccentric, markedly personal,  noteworthy, particular, peculiar, singular, uncommon ... Too many adjectives, and a book that deserves them all: \\"Inventario II\\".<br />\\"Inventario II\\" (\\"Inventory II\\") compiles the poems in Spanish that Mario Benedetti wrote from 1986 to 1991. But... who is Benedetti?. That is an extremely pertinent question, especially in the USA, where not many people know him (unfortunately for them, I might add). He is a very gifted poet and writer, born in Uruguay in 1920, who had to abandon his country for quite a few years due to a military dictatorship in his country... In my opinion, some of his books are wonderful, and \\"Inventario II\\" is one of them. I generally don't like poetry, but after borrowing this book from a friend out of curiosity, I decided to buy it.<br />I would like to point out that my favorite poem in this book is \\"Otherness\\", written in Spanish but with a title in English. I'll copy the last part of that poem, as a way of ending my review. After all, what better way to make you understand how well Mario Benedetti writes than allowing you to appreciate exactly that?:<br />\\"...siempre me aconsejaron que escribiera distinto<br />pero he decidido desalentar / humilde<br />y cautelosamente a mis mentores<br />en consecuencia seguir&eacute; escribiendo<br />igual a m&iacute; o sea<br />de un modo obvio ir&oacute;nico terrestre<br />rutinario trist&oacute;n desangelado<br />(por otros adjetivos se ruega consultar<br />cr&iacute;ticas de los &uacute;ltimos treinta a&ntilde;os)<br />y eso tal vez ocurra porque no s&eacute; ser otro<br />que ese otro que soy para los otros\\".<br />Oh!!.

Jose Ortega y Gasset (1883-1955) was a well-known Spanish philosopher, and this is one of his best books. He wrote &quot;The revolt of the masses&quot; in 1930, but that book is still very useful to analyze reality in many countries, despite the fact that the author intended to study only the situation in Europe...<br /><br /> What is the subject of this book?. Well, the subject is the advent to power in Europe of what he calls the mass-men, who, according to him, are characterized by being just like everybody else. The mass-men have always existed, but whereas in the past they allowed the men of excellence to direct society, now they claim all the power. Ortega y Gasset says that what is new is that &quot;the commonplace mind, knowing itself to be commonplace, has the assurance to proclaim the rights of the commonplace and to impose them wherever it will&quot;. Thus, the mass-men claim that everything that is different needs to be crushed: uniformity is good, all else should be suppressed.<br /><br /> But are the mass-men capable of leading society?. According to the author, they are not. He displays an enormous amount of elitism when he affirms that the culture of the mass-man isn?t true culture, because there isn?t culture where there are no standards to which anybody can make an appeal. He gives an example of the modern mass-man when he points out what was happening then under Fascism, due to the fact that &quot;there appears for the first time in Europe a type of man who does not want to give reasons or to be right, but simply shows himself resolved to impose his opinions&quot;.<br /><br /> Ortega says that the way the mass-man behaves in public life arises from his psychological structure. Each mass-man considers &quot;his moral and intellectual endowment as excellent, complete&quot;. As a result, he doesn?t listen to others, and will try to impose his point of view on everything. Does that sound familiar to you?. Ortega was talking about something that was happening in the 1930?s, but...couldn?t what he said also be applied to some of the things that happen nowadays?.<br /><br /> I really liked this book, despite the fact that I certainly do not agree with everything that the author wrote. For example, I think that everybody can learn if they want to do so, and that elitism isn?t the way to change things. However, I think that Ortega noticed a danger that was present in his society, and that we still have in ours: lack of communication, and a tendence to impose opinions on others. In this review I have only made a few remarks regarding some of the points Ortega y Gasset discusses in &quot;The revolt of the masses&quot;. Notwithstanding that, you will find that he talks about much more.<br /><br /> All in all, I highly recommend &quot;The revolt of the masses&quot;...

Are the theories of decline regarding USA's power correct?. In \\"Bound to lead\\", Nye tackles that question, and many more. According to the author, USA is still the main superpower, but it will have to change its strategies if it wants to go on being one, due to the fact that the nature of power has changed.<br />Nye distinguishes two faces of power. The first face is command or \\"hard power\\", and with it \\"you get other states to do what you want\\". The main source of \\"hard power\\" is military power. On the other hand, you have the second face of power, co- optive or \\"soft power\\", and with it \\"you make others want what you want\\". The main sources of soft power are intangible power resources like national cohesion, culture, ideology and influence on international institutions. Both faces of power are necessary, and they coexist, but soft power is becoming increasingly important as years go by. If USA wants to be able to control its political environment, and to \\"get other nations to do what it wants\\", it will need to keep that in mind, and react accordingly.<br />In my opinion, one of the main ideas in \\"Bound to lead\\" is that in the XXI century USA won't face new challengers: it will need to deal with new challenges. A good example of those \\"new challenges\\" is the transformation of power I already mentioned: soft power is becoming essential to USA if it wants to attain its goals. It is evident that power is becoming less fungible, less coercive and less tangible. The real question is if USA will understand that, or if it will try to achieve its objectives without paying attention to the legitimacy in the eyes of other states that the second face of power can lend to its actions...<br />Nye, who is nowadays dean of the Kennedy School for Government at Harvard University, wrote this excellent book in 1990. His main recommendation regarding USA's policy was then to invest more in soft power resources, because they help to provide co-optive behavioural power. It is relevant to highlight that that recommendation is as valid today as it was in 1990, if not more so.<br />I believe that most people who want to know more about what is happening in the world will enjoy &quot;Bound to lead&quot;. You don't need to know about the subject beforehand: the book is clear, and repeats some basic concepts that those who have read more about the subject already know. Notwithstanding that, this book will be interesting even for them: Nye's book is rather unpretentious, but it has a lot to contribute to their knowledge of International Relations. In this case, simplicity doesn't mean triviality. All in all I can strongly recommend this book to you. I think it is a classic, more than well worth your time and money...<br />Belen Alcatant to highlight that that recommendation is as valid today as it was in 1990, if not more so.  <br />I believe that most people who want to know more about what is happening in the world will enjoy &quot;Bound to lead&quot;.

Many people have read Dante's \\"Divine Comedy\\", but only some know that besides being a wonderful poet he was also a noteworthy political thinker. If you read \\"Monarchy\\", a book that he wrote in 1313, you will realize why...<br />Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) was born in Florence, Italy, and he participated actively in the political life of his city, being one of the officials in charge of the government of Florence. As such, he took some decisions that were considered by many anti-papal, but that he deemed not only adequate but essential in order to limit the influence of the Church in politics. As a result, sometime later (when the balance of power changed, and the Church had the upper hand), he was exiled from Florence and told that if he were to return he would be executed. It is rather unsurprising that this event only made him more sure of what he already thought: that the Church shouldn't be involved in politics.<br />The mere idea that the Church wasn't more important than the Empire was rather controversial at the time that this book was written, because some said that the Church had a right to oversee the Empire, to watch over it and direct it if necessary. Others, for example Dante, were vehemently opposed to that idea, and took upon themselves the task of increasing the power of the Emperor. In \\"Monarchy\\" he tries to explain what form of political organization is the one that allows human beings to reach their objectives more easily. Dante distinguishes two orders and two authorities (Church and Empire), and says that the basis for that distinction is the two main objectives that men have in their lives: eternal happiness and happiness in this life. He defends the importance of the Empire, and says that it doesn't need to obey the Church. Dante also points out that the authority of the secular prince is not derived from the Church, but comes directly to him from God.<br />On the whole, this book is quite interesting, and it introduces you to a different side of Dante: the political thinker. Moreover, it allows you to know more about the controversy regarding the Church and the Empire, a debate that was very important in the XIVth century. It is also worthwhile pointing out that \\"Monarchy\\" is quite short, so you won't lose too much of your time reading it, but you are likely to learn a lot.

How can an author keep the reader interested in his book when he gives away the ending in the first page?. Well, he needs to be an extraordinary writer, with the ability to enthrall the reader completely. Of course, not everybody can do that, but the truth is that the author of this book isn't &quot;everybody&quot;. Gabriel Garc?a M?rquez was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982, and he clearly deserved it. You can easily see that if you read some of the many master pieces he wrote: this is just one of them.<br /><br /> &quot;Chronicle of a Death Foretold&quot; has many ingredients that make it a wonderful book. In my opinion the most important ones are Garc?a Marquez's brilliant prose, and the risk he took by doing the unthinkable: bluntly telling the reader the end of the story in the first pages of the book.<br /><br /> However, I think I should also highlight that the story itself is excellent: a wedding, a bride returned to her family in disgrace, her brothers forced by their code of honor to kill her previous lover, and announcing to all that want to hear them that they intend to do so. This is indeed the &quot;Chronicle of a Death Foretold&quot;... Everyone knows who is going to die, except for the intended victim and his mother.<br /><br /> On the whole, this book is incredibly good and somewhat picturesque. The story takes place many years ago, in a provincial town with different values from those we have nowadays, and Garc?a M?rquez manages to make the reader understand that. I couldn't ignore the sense of fatalism that pervades the book, probably due to the fact that something is already certain: things will turn out badly in the end.<br /><br /> Despite that, even though we know from the first page what is going to happen, we still want to find out why did it happen. There is another pertinent question: who were the culprits?. The girl's brothers or the whole town, that knowing what they were going to do didn't stop them?. In Lope de Vega's words, I believe that &quot;Fuenteovejuna did it&quot;... But that is merely a personal opinion.<br /><br /> My advice?. Buy this book, read it, and reach your own conclusions. You are highly likely to enjoy the process :)<br /><br /> Belen Alcatenteovejuna did it&quot;... But that is merely a personal opinion.       My advice?.

This edition of \\"Fuenteovejuna\\", one of the most important classics of Spanish literature, includes not only the original version in Spanish, but also an English translation that will allow those who don't speak Spanish to appreciate Lope de Vega's book.<br />Lope de Vega (1562-1635) was a famous Spanish poet and writer, and \\"Fuenteovejuna\\" is one of his best-known works. \\"Fuenteovejuna\\"'s subject is how those without power can fight (and win) against a tyranny. He drew inspiration from a historical event that took place in a small town, in 1476, and managed to write a book that somehow retains its actuality even today. Yes, of course the language in which this book is written is outdated, and some expressions are certainly old-fashioned, but the main theme hasn't lost its edge.<br />The plot of this not overly long book is quite simple: the men and women of Fuenteovejuna, after enduring a great amount of injustices from their unfair Commendator, Fern&aacute;n G&oacute;mez de Guzm&aacute;n, killed him in a popular revolt. When the king sent the authorities to investigate, they couldn't find the culprits, because when asked who had killed the Commendator, all the villagers answered &quot;Fuenteovejuna did it.&quot;<br />\\"Fuenteovejuna\\" has achieved a noteworthy place as one of the more relevant books in Spanish literature, and the phrase &quot;Fuenteovejuna did it&quot; is still used by many when they want to imply that a deed was provoked by an entire group, not merely by some individuals.

This is merely one of the advices Lord Chesterfield gave to his natural son, Philip, in the many letters he wrote to him from 1737 onwards, and that this book compiles.<br /><br /> Chesterfield was an important stateman, who wrote these letters only for the eyes of his son, not for the general public, so he did express in stark terms what he truly thought about many controversial themes. It is, in my opinion, very interesting to read what he considered to be general truths, and to get to know his conception of life, society and politics. Whether you agree or not with his opinions, you cannot remain indifferent to this controversial book.<br /><br /> Lord Chesterfield places great value on appearances. He tells Philip that &quot;If your air and address are vulgar, awkward, and gauche, you may be esteemed indeed, if you have great intrinsic merit; but you will never please; and without pleasing you will rise but heavily&quot;. The author is, evidently, a cynic who doesn't believe that the world can be improved. He points out that &quot;The world is taken by the outside of things, and we must take the world as it is&quot;. Chesterfields profession is fairly evident at all times, for example when he advises his son &quot;...to be upon your own guard, and yet, by a seeming natural openness, to put people off theirs&quot;.<br /><br /> &quot;Lord Chesterfield's Letters&quot; has been considered a noteworthy classic by many, but it has also been strongly criticized. For example, Samuel Johnson said that it taught &quot;the morals of a whore and the manners of a dancing-master&quot;. I really don't agree with Johnson: I happen to like this book, and a lot. It is not only very easy to read, but also informative. The reader feels as if he were talking with an old but very experienced person, who played an active part in an enormous number of significant events, and who wants to transmit his knowledge not only on diplomatic affairs, but also about life and education. He often displays great insight, for example when he says that &quot;You must look into people, as well as at them. Almost all people are born with all the passions, to a certain degree; but almost every man has a prevailing one, to which the others are subordinate&quot;.<br /><br /> All in all, I strongly recommend this book. It includes a high number of subjects, and I think you are highly likely to find it very appealing. If more is needed to convince you, I'll just leave you with one of the phrases written by the author, and I'll let its excellence to speak for itself: &quot;Mind, not only what people say, but how they say it; and, if you have any sagacity, you may discover more truth by your eyes than by your ears. People can say what they will, but they cannot look just as they will; and their looks frequently discover, what their words are calculated to conceal&quot;. What else can I say?...

If more is needed to convince you, I'll just leave you with one of the phrases written by the author, and I'll let its excellence to speak for itself: &quot;Mind, not only what people say, but how they say it; and, if you have any sagacity, you may discover more truth by your eyes than by your ears. People can say what they will, but they cannot look just as they will; and their looks frequently discover, what their words are calculated to conceal&quot;. What else can I say?... Enjoy this book!.      Belen Alcat	2004-05-05

Aristotle was an important thinker, born in 384 BCE at Stagirus (a Greek colony), who is considered by many the founder of the realist tradition in Philosophy. He wrote many noteworthy books, among which \\"The Politics\\" stands out. \\"The Politics\\" is one of the first books I read at university, and even though it took me a lot of time to read it, I ended up being grateful to the professor that included it as obligatory reading material for History of Political Ideas I  :)<br />In \\"The Politics\\", the author begins by analyzing the human being, that is in his opinion a political animal by nature. Afterwards, he explains what are, for him, the origins of the polis: family, small village and then, polis. Aristotle says that even though the polis is the last chronologically, it is all the same the most important, because it is autarchic. The polis (not exactly like our states, but similar to them in some aspects) is a natural community, because it answers to something that human beings need. Only in the polis will men find perfection, only there will they be completely human. Aristotle distinguishes between citizens and non-citizens (the vast majority), and points out that only citizens have political rights. The author delves in many other themes, for example the causes of revolution, the good and bad forms of government, and the \\"ideal\\" form of government. What is more, he also considers several constitutions, and talks about the adequate education that forms good citizens for the polis.<br />Now, why should you read a book that was written many centuries ago and that on top of that isn't especially easy to read?. The answer is quite simple: \\"The Politics\\" is worth it. Of course, you will find faults in some of Aristotle's opinions (for instance, he thought that slaves were \\"live property\\", and that slavery was a natural institution), but you cannot ignore that most of his book is as relevant today as it was when he wrote it. \\"The Politics\\" is a book that teaches the reader to analyze reality, and to watch things differently, from another perspective. It also mentions several times that it is always necessary to take into account the context, because there are not perfect solutions good for every circumstance. Even though that seems merely common sense, it is an often forgotten truth...<br />On the whole, I can recommend this book to all those who are interested in Political Science, History of Ideas, or simply curious. I can guarantee that if you are patient enough to end it, you will learn a lot.<br />Belen Alcatreader to analyze reality, and to watch things differently, from another perspective.

Do you think I'm a little overenthusiastic?. By no means!!. This dictionary is an essential \\"survival tool\\" if you want (or are forced to) learn French.<br />To start with, it is very easy to use, even for beginners. Moreover, it includes up-to-date vocabulary, so if you go to France you won't end up speaking as the French used to speak, 50 years ago. As if that were not enough, it also has many examples of different kinds of correspondence you might need to write (for example, in order to make a complaint, or to decline an invitation).<br />However, my favorite feature is a thematic wordfinder that helps the reader to express his ideas more easily. In the thematic wordfinder you will find the expressions that aid you when you need to structure your essays, and lists of vocabulary arranged according to themes. I think everybody \\"suffers\\" when his teacher gives him, as homework, a composition on natural disasters, commerce or something like that. The ideas are there, but you just cannot find the words... Well, with the wordfinder that is quite simple. In my opinion, this particular feature is useful not only for students of French, but also for students that have to write an essay in their native language about a subject that they don't know too much about. By taking advantage of the fact that this dictionary is bilingual, they can use adequate and specific language regarding the theme.<br />All in all, I highly recommend this dictionary. It will help you to improve your French, and you will learn to express your ideas better :)<br />Belen Alcat	2004-05-02

The aim of the author, in this book, is to allow the reader to learn more about the Contemporary History of Latin America. His objective is quite difficult to achieve, because Latinoamerican countries are notably diverse, and their history is different. Despite that, Halperin Donghi accomplishes his objective very well, by highlighting the processes that those countries have in common, but without ignoring their differences.<br />\\"The Contemporary History of Latin America\\" is divided in nine chapters and an epilogue. At the beginning of each one, the author gives us a general overview of the economic and social developments common to the whole region, and afterwards he studies the political developments in each country. The book begins by an analysis of  \\"The colonial heritage\\", and afterwards studies \\"The crisis of independence\\" (1810-1825), \\"The early national period\\" (1825-1850), the \\"Emergence of the neocolonial order\\" (1850-1880), the \\"Maturity of the neocolonial order\\" (1880-1930), and the problematic periods that followed: from 1930 to 1945 (economic crisis and preparations for the Second World War), from 1945 to 1960 (the postwar period), and from 1960 to 1970. Halperin Donghi also talks about events that happened not so long ago, and tries to be impartial. In my opinion, he succeeds...<br />This book isn't exhaustive, but it doesn't pretend to be so. In my opinion, it is a very good introduction to the History of Latin America, but it is only that: an introduction. You will need to go on reading, and studying, if you want to learn more about each country. On the other hand, even if you need to read more books, you might as well start by reading this one, because it is a classic on the subject.<br />\\"The Contemporary History of Latin America\\" isn't particularly entertaining, but it is very useful, and I think you should buy it, if you are interested in the history of the region. I prefer other books written by the author (for example \\"La democracia de masas\\"), but I am aware of the fact that this book is extraordinarily practical, and I appreciate it as a more than adequate framework for my studies regarding the Contemporary History of Latin America. I bought it, and I use it as a reference book.

In this concise but great book we see the genesis and evolution of what afterwards was known as &quot;Peronism&quot;. Peronism changed Argentina politically, socially and (why not?) economically forever. That is the reason why you must understand it, if you want to understand Argentina.<br /><br /> The author pays particular attention to the political system in 1943, and also to the transformation that was taking place in Argentina?s society during that time. Halperin Donghi seeks the roots of Peron?s movement, and manages to do so, or at the very least to offer some very plausible explanations. What is more, he shows us how Peron became president, and what he did during his terms as such.<br /><br /> Tulio Halperin Donghi also allows us to comprehend the polarization that took place in Argentina, a polarization that became violent, and that permeated everything. The country ended up divided in two contrasting positions: peronists and no peronists. Some tried to end that dichotomy by force, and provoked the military coup d'etat of 1955. They were wrong... The dichotomy was not solved: it was exacerbated. The bitterness between the two sectors didn?t disappear: it increased noticeably.<br /><br /> The author of &quot;La democracia de masas&quot; is a very competent historian, and that can be seen quite easily throughout the book. He is clear, but he doesn?t oversimplify what he is studying by ignoring nuances. I also would like to highlight that this book has a distinctive characteristic that makes it noteworthy, when compared to other books on Argentinian History: it includes many photographs regarding the examined period.<br /><br /> On the whole, I think that this book is great, and I recommend it either to those who are interested in Argentinian history, or to those who are learning Spanish and want to read a good book in that language that teaches them something interesting. Enjoy it !!!.<br /><br /> Belen Alcat	2004-05-01
US	50950064	RDTUTSLWL8GQH	014009766X	823772714	The Complete Father Brown (Father Brown Mystery)	Books	5	33	34	N	N	Eminently readable and witty...	This book compiles some short detective stories, with an unlikely protagonist, a priest. Father Brown is a rather quiet main character, unpretentious but remarkably assured. He uses logic in order to solve his cases, and he makes abundant use of good judgment and sound sense. Father Brown has an unique \\"worldly shrewdness\\", that probably stems from the fact that he spends many hours each day listening to the sins of other people. As a result, he is more or less acquainted with the bad side of human beings.<br />Father Brown is considered by many \\"the second most famous mystery-solver in English literature\\", the first being Sherlock Holmes. To tell the truth, I prefer Father Brown to Sherlock Holmes: he might not be as showy as Conan Doyle's character, but he is far more likeable, and his stories seem more likely to be real. Moreover, Chesterton's Father Brown doesn't  just chase criminals, he allows the reader to learn about some interesting themes that were important when these stories were first published, but that also are important now, for example the relationship between faith and reason. He manages to that because he doesn't merely want to \\"catch the criminal\\", he also endeavors to understand human nature, and the reasons why a criminal becomes one.<br />The author of these mystery stories was Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874-1936), a renowned English writer who wrote them between 1911 and 1936. His stories are as popular now as they were then, mainly to to the fact that Chesterton's style is compelling and refreshing, eminently readable and witty. Thus, these stories appeal not only to those who want to read a good book written in an exceptionally good english, but also to those who want to do exactly that without having to exhert themselves.<br />On the whole, I think this collection of short stories is worth buying and reading, not only once but many times. I highly enjoyed it, and I strongly recommend it to you :)<br />Belen Alcat	2004-05-01

On the other hand, even if you are one of those who generally don't enjoy books that require the reader to use his imagination, you can enormously enjoy this book. So I guess it all comes down to whether or not you are willing to risk it...<br />The plot is pretty strange. Fforde takes us to a surreal version of Great Britain, in the year 1985. We can recognize some aspects of his world, but not all of them. For example, in the author's world, technology is much more advanced (it is acceptable to clone extinguished animals and to have them as pets), the Crimean War didn't stop and everybody loves literature. It could be said that literature is for them what sports are to us: a national passion. Anyway, in that kind of world, that is already beginning to sound weird (but in a nice way), there is a Special Operations Network that was created in order to \\"handle policing duties considered either to unusual or too specialized to be tackled by the regular force\\". Most of the operatives are rather peculiar. There is a saying that explains that more clearly: \\"If you want to be a SpecOp, act kinda weird...\\".<br />Miss Thursday Nexts is a Spec- Op 27 who loves literature and specializes in problems related to literature, like all Spec-ops 27. She is intelligent and capable, strong but also vulnerable, and she was a sense of humor I found delightful. Thursday is more or less bored with her job, due to the fact that she finds it too routinary. After all, how many book forges can you detect before getting bored?. However, something is going to happen that is going to change her ordinary tasks. Someone discovers a way to \\"jump\\" into books, and as a result a criminal mastermind has a strange idea: he devices a way to kidnap a character of one of the most beloved books.<br />From that point onwards, the reader will accompany agent Next in her bizarre investigation. I can guarantee something: you won't be bored. The plot has a high degree of unpredictability, and some characters are not only atypical but also mystifying. As a result, \\"The Eyre Affair\\" has a dreamlike quality I consider enchanting and very appealing. You might be puzzled sometimes, but you will relish that feeling.<br />I would like to highlight the fact that the author makes lots of literary allusions, but that is only to be expected, due to the fact that in Thursday's world literature is extremely important. An small example?: so many people change their names in order to have the name of a famous author, that they need to be also identified with numbers, to avoid confusions. From my point of view, the constant evident or implied references to literature (books and characters) was charming. I probably didn't catch all the allusions, but I caught enough of them in order to be interested and pleased. I don't think you need to be an \\"expert\\" in order to enjoy this book. Even if you don't have a high degree of knowledge regarding literature, you are bound to appreciate it... And who knows, you might end up learning a bit, as I did.<br />Fforde style is eccentric and whimsical, but I loved it. This book was certainly something different, that made me think several times, and laugh a lot. I will continue reading the series, because I value a good book that is original, and Fforde is decidedly capable of writing them. On balance, I highly recommend this book to you. Enjoy it as much as I did !.<br />Belen Alcatinvestigation. I can guarantee something: you won´t be bored.

Roberto Arlt (1900-1942) was an important Argentinian writer. This isn't his most well-known book, but it is probably his more enjoyable one.<br />Why do I say that?. I find \\"Aguafuertes porte&ntilde;as\\" peculiarly enthralling. This unusual book is about nothing and about all. It compilates some short articles that Arlt wrote for the newspaper \\"El Mundo\\" (from Buenos Aires, Argentina), between 1928 and 1933. The subject of those articles was the \\"porte&ntilde;o's idiosyncrasy\\", shown clearly by the author's cutting and acid observations. The stories are many, and the characters different, but all of them, taken as a whole, allow us to appreciate the diverse components of Buenos Aires' society, at that time.<br />This book is very easy to read, provided you speak Spanish. Arlt's style is concise and straightforward, and I think you will enjoy it. All in all, highly recommended !!!<br />Belen Alcat	2004-04-23

Of course, you might think that the subject is trivial to you. After all, how important can a book like that be?. Well, if you were to think that, you would be enormously mistaken.<br />To start with, this book is a milestone you need to be aware of. Thucydides, its author, is very possibly the first modern historian. He tried to explain the causes of the Peloponnesian War, without reducing its complexity by saying that the gods had motivated it. Thucydides doesn't follow the easy path; instead, he searches those causes in human nature, and in power. He doesn't weave tales, but tries to write History.<br />It is rather astonishing how objective this Athenian was when he analyzed the war, and all that happened immediately before it. He examines methodically many events, paying special attention to facts. The author also gives his opinion from time to time, but he doesn't judge whether an action is good or evil: he merely shows that those that have power can use it as they see fit. Due to that, Thucydides is called by many the first realist theoretician.  I was especially taken aback by how well he expresses his ideas regarding the fact that \\"power makes right\\" in the Melian debate. I don't agree with him, but I cannot deny that he makes a powerful case, and that his point of view is shared nowadays by many noteworthy thinkers.<br />It is important to point out that in \\"History of the Peloponnesian War\\" you will find a painstaking account of many things that actually happened, but also some speeches that weren't made by the actors, but could have been made by them. To explain that more clearly: Thucydides wrote some political dialogues and monologues that allow us to understand some aspects of the conflict (and many of his ideas) better. The introduction to this edition also highlights that the author sometimes made up some of the speeches (from the data he had), and was present when others were pronounced. My favorite speech is the one made by Pericles, in honor of the men who died during the war. In that discourse, he explains why those men fought and died to defend Athens, and what Athens meant not only for Athenians but also for Greece.<br />This book isn't easy to read, but it is well-worth the effort. The translation is quite good, so that will make your task a little easier. If you don't feel like reading this book all at once, try to read it little by little. The results will be the same, but you won't feel dismayed by the need of finishing it immediately.<br />Also, if you can, try to relate some of Thucydides themes to our modern world. You will find that easier that you might think, and it will make you pay more attention to what you are reading. You are likely to be very surprised, for example, at how similar some of nowaday's justifications for taking advantage of power without paying attention to justice are to those that Thucydides already made a long time ago.

Keohane and Nye say that \\"Contemporary world politics is not a seamless web; it is a tapestry of diverse relationships. In such a world, one model cannot explain all situations. The secret of understanding lies in knowing which approach or combinations of approaches to use in analyzing a situation\\". In that phrase we can find the purpose of this book: to give the reader some analytical tools that will help him to comprehend our world.<br />The authors say that neither the traditionalist vision nor the modernist vision is nowadays adequate to interpret our world, due to the fact that there is an ever- growing and multidimensional interdependence. Their task is to point out to us the situations in which the assumptions that characterize each vision should be applied, to offer good predictions and satisfying answers. In their words, \\"to provide a means of distilling and blending the wisdom in both positions by developing a coherent theoretical framework for the political analysis of interdependence\\".<br />In \\"Power and interdependence\\", you will be introduced to quite a few interesting concepts, starting by what does interdependence mean, and the differences between interdependence and dependence. Each definition is accompanied by several examples, that make the concepts easier to grasp.<br />I found especially interesting the way in which Keohane and Nye explained the role of power in interdependence, by distinguishing between two dimensions of interdependence: sensitivity and vulnerability. Sensitivity has to do with how much a country is affected by the policies of another country before reacting to those changes (the key assumption here is that the framework isn't changed). On the other hand, vulnerability takes into account how well and quickly a country can react to the changes in policies produced by other states, and has to do with the existence of alternatives (the assumption here is that the framework is changed). The authors illustrate this distinction with examples taken from history, and conclude that sensitivity interdependence is not as important as vulnerability interdependence from the point of view of providing power resources to actors.<br />Another interesting feature of this book is that the authors compare two ideal types: realism and one that they constructed, complex interdependence. None of these ideal types reflects reality exactly, but they help to understand what happens, because most situations fall between these two extremes.<br />They say that the realist ideal type involves three basic assumptions. To start with, states (rational and coherent units) are the more important actors in world politics, and interstate channels are the norm. Secondly, force is the more effective instrument of policy, even when there are others. Lastly, there is a hierarchy of issues, and the one that dominates is military security.<br />In contrast to that, the ideal type of complex interdependence has rather different assumptions. To begin with, the state is not the only important unit, and there are many channels that connect societies (not only interstate channels, but also transgovernmental and transnational ones). Also, there isn't a hierarchy among issues, and it is more difficult to distinguish between domestic and foreign policy. Finally, \\"military interdependence is not used by governments towards other governments within the region, or on the issues, when complex interdependence prevails\\". By that, I think that the authors mean the relationships between developed countries (North/North relationships). In complex interdependence, military force loses a lot (but not all) of its importance, mainly because using force can have negative effects on non security goals.<br />Other themes that you will find in \\"Power and interdependence\\" but that I won't explain now (this review is already too long!!) are linkage strategies (different for strong and weak states) and the role of International Organizations, agenda setting, international regime changes, the relationships between USA and Canada and Australia, and USA, its leadership and complex interdependence.<br />Keohane and Nye try to explain us how our world is changing (and yes, they had already observed those changes when this book was first published, many years ago), and highlight many times throughout the pages of this book that they believe that different frameworks are needed for different situations, and that old contributions are as worthy as new ones. It is essential, however, to know when to use each one, and when we must combine them, in order to grasp the various situations.  Due to the fact that they repeat the same thing many times, the reader is highly unlikely to forget it. To me that is great, because it is an idea we need to remember.<br />\\"Power and interdependence\\" is neither overly easy to read, nor too difficult. However, if you are tenacious you will be rewarded, because you will end up having another tool with which to understand the world.

The reason for that is, in my opinion, that it is always better to read a book in the language it was written, so as not to miss any nuances in meaning, and in order to appreciate better the style of the author. Disregarding how good a translator is, he is bound to make at least some mistakes, sometimes ignoring slight degrees of difference that convey not only meaning, but also feeling.<br />In this version there are parts where it isn't easy to follow the author's ideas, but from my point of view that is due to two things. To start with, it isn't easy to explain Argentina's history, because it is quite complex. As a result, explanations regarding that theme are frequently complicated, even in the original version of this book in spanish. Secondly, translating a book to another language is never easy, and I think that the interpreter (James Brennan) did his job incredibly well.<br />The structure of &quot;A History of Argentina in the Twentieth Century&quot; is quite simple, but really useful and eminently practical. After a short introduction, the author starts this book with Yrigoyen's first presidential term, continues with Alvear's presidency and then carries on with Yrigoyen's unfinished second term. He delves deeply into the conservative restoration, and then tries to explain what Per&oacute;n meant to Argentina, and the polarization of society that his presidency produced. From then on, democratic governments would be constantly interrupted by revolts, and the military would have the final word regarding all matters of importance in Argentina. That, until the Malvina's defeat, which ended up in the collapse of the military regime, and the beginning of a fledging democracy... This, the first edition in english of &quot;Breve Historia Contemporanea de Argentina&quot;, has also new chapter that delves into the decade of the 1990s, and that wasn't included in the 1994 spanish edition.<br />Luis Alberto Romero is a very well known argentinian historian, author of other good books. Despite that, this is the one I prefer, at least so far. Notwithstanding the fact that it deals mainly with historical facts, it also includes his interpretation regarding what happened.<br />Some people criticize the author because he ask them to &quot;accept his interpretation of History&quot;. I don't think that is the case. The aim of the author was to write an useful and short book for his students and the average reader interested in History, and in order to do so he sometimes had to write directly what he thought about a period, instead of saying what many authors thought about the same period.

I don´t think that is the case. The aim of the author was to write an useful and short book for his students and the average reader interested in History, and in order to do so he sometimes had to write directly what he thought about a period, instead of saying what many authors thought about the same period.

I wanted to buy an useful and not too expensive Geographic Atlas. I dedicated quite a lot of time to evaluating my options, and ended up deciding that this Atlas was likely to be a good choice, basing my decision on the sample pages that Amazon offers. Fortunately, when I received my purchase, I discovered that I had made the right decision  :)<br /><br />I guess I was lucky. I thought that this Atlas was probably good, so I took the chance and bought it... However, I could have been wrong. The problem is that this Atlas had no customer reviews, and I generally make my decisions regarding what to buy in Amazon based on the experiences of others who have already purchased the item I want. The reason for that is that an editorial review can be inaccurate, and the back cover can (sometimes) provide inexact information, but other customers generally tell the truth...<br /><br />Now, I'd like to correct the lack of reviews on this Atlas by writing one. I really don't need to say too much, basically that all that the back cover says is true. You can read that back cover in the sample pages, and you can also read the table of contents and an excerpt.  Anyway, if you don't want to spend time doing that, I can repeat to you some of the facts you could read there :)<br /><br />First of all, I want to highlight the fact that there are 90 detailed and colorful maps. Those maps include physical and political maps, maps about climate and precipitation, and about population. In addition to that, the maps are separated in different sections, and at the end of each section there is a chapter that centers on a particular problem. For example, at the end of the section dedicated to North America, the focus is on natural hazards, and in the section dedicated to South America the focus is on the Amazon Rain Forest. There are other chapters that focus on special themes in the sections regarding Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and Oceania, and Antarctica.<br /><br />As if that were not enough, you can find many charts and graphs alongside the maps. What is more, the organization of the information that accompanies them is clear and didactical. You will also be able to find country flags and facts, and some web sites where you will be able to find updated information, even after buying this Atlas. There is also a Glossary that defines some terms the average reader might not be familiar with, and a thematic Index.<br /><br />On the whole, my opinion is that this Atlas is great. It probably isn't the finest Geographic Atlas<br />you can buy, but I think that it is likely to be the best you can buy at this highly reasonable price.  I strongly recommend it, if you need an Atlas that is useful, not too big (so as to carry it with you) and specially not expensive. I think that you will enjoy reading it, and that you will learn a lot :)<br /><br />Belen Alcatnd graphs alongside the maps.

This might be the solution for you !!!.<br />In \\"Sophie's World\\" you will find an interesting novel, intertwined almost seamlessly with the History of Philosohy. Is that possible?. For Jostein Gaarder, yes. This former philosophy teacher, born in 1952 in Oslo (Norway), reached success with this book, which has managed to attract even those not commonly interested in Philosophy and also, somehow, to become part of the bibliography of many undergraduate philosophy courses.<br />The plot of the book is rather simple. It centers on Sophie Amundsen, a fourteen year old girl approaching her fifteen birthday, who one day begins to receive letters from someone she doesn't know. In those letters, her unknown correspondent  begins to tell her about the History of Philosophy, the subject he studies. Sophie's goes on receiving those letters throughout the novel, and they become an essential part of the plot, which is a mystery with unexpected turnarounds.<br />I would like to point out that I noticed a change in Sophie's attitude towards the world and what was happening around her, as the novel is nearer to its end. After learning in those letters about the History of Philosophy (that could also be called the History of Thought), she starts to think in a different, more analytical way. In my opinion, the reader suffers the same process that changes Sophie, and that is not a bad thing at all.<br />It is important to remark upon the fact that the letters that Sophie's correspondent sends her are written in a clear way, so that  she (a teenager) would be able  to understand them. Due to the fact that in those letters the main theme is Philosophy, the reader can not only enjoy a good novel but also have access to graspable explanations regarding the ideas of some philosophers, so far unknown or incomprehensible to him.<br />I recommend this book to anybody curious enough to want to read it. It doesn't require too much effort: you will learn without being aware of doing so. Concerning the age of the reader, I think that \\"Sophie's World\\" can be read easily by teenagers, but will also be appealing to adults who enjoy a good book.<br />On the whole, I believe this book is worth buying, reading and keeping. It is not perfect, though, because I think that the plot of the novel could have been better. However, there aren't too many perfect things in this world, and unfortunately that includes books. So my advice is: read it !!!. You are highly likely to enjoy doing that, and you will appreciate the change of perspective that \\"Sophie's World\\"  will bring to you.<br />Belen  Alcatit.

Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859) wrote many books, but his best-known one is probably &quot;Democracy in America&quot;. Despite that, reading &quot;The Old Regime and the Revolution&quot; (1856) is essential in order to understand how much Tocqueville contributed to an accurate analysis of the present and past of his society, and to Political Science.<br />Why is &quot;The Old Regime and the Revolution&quot; a classic?. Why do teachers keep recommending it to their students?. In my opinion, the answer to both those questions is that this book is an example of the kind of work a political scientist is capable of producing, if inclined to do so. Here, Tocqueville doesn't pay attention to the conventionally accepted truth, but looks beyond it, in order to form his own opinion. And when the result of that process is shocking, he doesn't back down bounded by conventions: he simply states his conclusions.<br />In &quot;The Old Regime and the Revolution&quot; Alexis de Tocqueville does what at his time was considered more or less unthinkable: to put into question the revolutionary character of...the French Revolution. He said that the only way to understand what happened in 1789 was to study the previous social processes, and to find what they have in common with what came about later. This change of perspective was radical, but effective. It didn't presuppose anything, and so it helped the author to arrive to a seemingly strange conclusion: that the French Revolution had not only continued with the social processes that were taking place in France, but accentuated them. For example, the governmental centralization was much worse after 1789. In a way, then, the French Revolution only carried forward with what the Old Regime had already started.<br />On the whole, I recommend this book mainly to those interested in French History and Political Science. It isn't overly easy to read, but you will realize that it is full of interesting information, and permeated by a painstakingly careful analysis regarding social processes that is remarkable. In my opinion, &quot;The Old Regime and the Revolution&quot; is a book that you won't regret buying :)<br />Belen Alcatnstakingly careful analysis regarding social processes that is remarkable.

Amado does just that, and in his books we can see a little of his beloved \\"Bahia\\". He deliberately ignores orthographic and grammatical rules, and adds in his written work expressions that so far could only be found in informal conversations. Amado wrote for everybody, in a language that the average person in Bahia, and Brazil, understood. He loved to be considered a \\"story-teller\\", rather than a \\"serious\\" writer that wrote only for a few.<br />I read this book for the first time during a course I attended regarding \\"A Literatura brasileira atrav&eacute;s dos contos\\". Most of the students (myself included) thought that \\"A morte e a morte de Quincas Berro D'&Aacute;gua\\" was only a long story. Our professor, Adriana Almeida, told us that it was a novel, due to the fact that it includes a lot of parallel stories and coexisting dramatic incidents, among other reasons.<br />But... What is this book about?. An essay that I liked a lot says that the action is, in this book \\"nitidamente imbricada no Realismo M&aacute;gico, mistura sonho e realidade; loucura e racionalidade; amor e desamor...\\" (\\"nitidly imbricated in Magical Realism, mixture of dream and reality; craziness and rationality; love and hate...\\"). I can only dream of saying something more accurate... You can find all that, an much more, in the few pages that compound this book. Yes,  \\"A morte e a morte de Quincas Berro D'&Aacute;gua\\" is about the two deaths of a person (possibly three deaths?), and about how a person can change dramatically his life, if he wishes to do so.<br />After reading \\"A morte e a morte de Quincas Berro D'&Aacute;gua\\" you will be able to decide by yourself who was happier, and who led a better life, if  Joaquim Soares da Cunha or Quincas Berro D'&Aacute;gua. Any opinion is valid, as far as you can give reasons for it.<br />On the whole, I strongly recommend this book, as an excellent example of the kind of work that a really gifted author can write. If you can, try to read this book in portuguese. If you are unable to do so, read a translation, because even if you won't appreciate all the subtle shades of meaning and feeling that can only be grasped in the original language, you will still enjoy it a lot.<br />Belen Alcatrson (possibly three deaths?), and about how a person can change dramatically his life, if he wishes to do so.<br />After reading \\"A morte e a morte de Quincas Berro D´Água\\" you will be able to decide by yourself who was happier, and who led a better life, if  Joaquim Soares da Cunha or Quincas Berro D´Água.

In \\"La Ciencia Pol&iacute;tica\\" (\\"Political Science\\"), professor Pr&eacute;lot tells us what is Political Science.

Secondly, Pr&eacute;lot gives the reader an historical overview of the origins, development and present state of Political Science. Finally, he analyses political ideas, political institutions and political life, as the fundamental structure of Political Science.<br />This edition is a translation of \\"La Science Politique\\", first published in Paris, in 1961. The book has not been updated but has remained nonetheless popular because it provides the student with a comprehensive view of the subject he is studying, managing to do so quite clearly and in not too many pages.

I will attempt to explain the first two, and I will leave the third to you so as to motivate you to read the book :)<br />Labor is, according to Arendt, those human activities whose main aim is to allow men to survive, for example eating, drinking and sleeping. These activities belong to the private sphere, and while the human being strives painstakingly to perform them, he is not free.<br />On the other hand, Action is the moment when the human being develops the capacity that distinguishes him, the ability of being free. This is the public sphere, where men, after having provided for themselves and their families what was needed to \\"continue in existence\\", can at last be free.<br />Arendt shows us the historical evolution of these concepts, and how that evolution is connected to the evolution of the concept of work. At the end of this book, you will have analyzed with her the human condition, from the point of view of the activities that the human being is capable of. What is more, you will be able to have a valid view regarding the past, and an interesting perspective on what is happening now, and on what the future may bring to us. Yes, it is true that this book was released a long time ago, but I believe that it is still as important now as it was then.<br /><br />Arendt (1906-1975) was a respected professor and thinker, who wrote books that greatly influenced quite a few of her contemporaries. Even though her more significant book was \\"Origins of Totalitarianism\\" (1951), \\"The human condition\\" is also essential in order to understand her ideas. Not only that, it will probably help you to understand our society, or at least to contemplate it through the eyes of a remarkably good political scientist.<br />I must warn you that \\"The human condition\\" isn't overly easy to read, and that you might find yourself re-reading a paragraph a few times before understanding what it means. However, at the end of the book you will realize that the effort is worthwhile, because then all you have read makes sense and leaves you with the sensation of having understood some concepts that you will find useful.<br />On the whole, recommended.

Its first edition was in 1946, but in the following editions the author added some chapters. In my opinion, \\"Las ideas pol&iacute;ticas en Argentina\\" (\\"Political ideas in Argentina\\") is nowadays as useful as it was in the year it was first published, because it allows us to understand Argentina's history, and therefore its present.<br />Romero says, in the foreword to \\"Las ideas pol&iacute;ticas en Argentina\\", that neither Argentina nor the rest of the Hispanoamerican countries have made an original theoretic contribution regarding Political Thought. Despite that, he points out that his purpose in writing this book wasn't to say something different. His aim was to show the reader that even if it lacks originality in a particular country, Political Thought should also be considered important, and meticulously studied.  The reason for that is that ideas live not only in a world of their own, but also in ours, due to the fact that they affect the way in which we behave. To quote the author,  \\"Aparte que sea o no original en el plano doctrinario, el pensamiento pol&iacute;tico de una colectividad posee siempre un alt&iacute;simo inter&eacute;s hist&oacute;rico; pero no solamente en cuanto es idea pura, sino tambi&eacute;n -y acaso m&aacute;s- en cuanto es conciencia de una actitud y motor de una conducta\\".<br />Jos&eacute; Luis Romero is a well-known Argentinian historian, who has written many other books about the history of my country. His son, Luis Alberto Romero, wrote my favorite book regarding Contemporary Argentinian History, \\"Breve Historia Contempor&aacute;nea de la Argentina\\". Anybody who is lucky enough to have read both that book and the one I'm reviewing right now cannot help but see that the son takes after the father: they are incredibly good historians, but also excellent writers.<br />All in all, I can heartily recommend this book to those interested in Argentina's history.

Now, after reaching an intermediate level, I still consider it is outstanding, but I need to combine it with an Italian-Italian dictionary (I bought \\"Il Nuovo Zingarelli Minore Vocabolario Della Lingua Italiana\\") in order to obtain the results I desire.<br />The \\"Harper Collins Italian College Dictionary\\" is a wonderful tool, that will help you to achieve your aim of learning Italian. To start with, it is a fully bilingual dictionary, from beginning to end: even the instructions regarding how to use it are both in Italian and in English. Secondly, this edition has been revised and updated in the year 2000, and many entries have been added. For instance, now you can find explanations (in English and Italian) about what means \\"eco - friendly\\" or \\"virtual reality\\".<br />What is more, the pronunciation of the words is pointed out to the reader, using the International Phonetic Alphabet. However, that is not what I found more useful. My favorite part in this dictionary was the section where you can find examples of formal and informal letters, job applications and curriculum vitaes. Particular attention is also payed in that section to essay writing. The authors promise that you'll find \\"extended examples demonstrating techniques for structuring, developing and concluding a reasoned argument\\", and they are telling the truth. Needless to say, the section is also in both languages, so you can use it to learn how to write better in Italian and in English. Your teacher is highly likely to be pleasantly surprised, and you'll realise that your homework is quite easier.<br />Finally, another of the features of this dictionary that I liked is that it puts together phrases you can say in different situations, for example phrases adequate for suggestions, advice, offers, requests, comparisons, opinions, obligation, agreement, likes and dislikes, approval and disapproval, obligation and permission. The translation from one language to the other is not always literal, because the authors wanted to preserve the meaning of the phrases. They say that they know that \\"putting one's ideas into another language is apt to be an awkward and frustrating process, resulting in clumsy constructions and a distorted version of what one wants to say\\", and they have tried to remedy that, by releasing this dictionary.<br />On the whole, I heartily recommend this dictionary to both the beginner and intermediate student of Italian. So far, I haven't reached the advanced level, but I have the suspicion that I'll find it useful even then.

Despite that, this is one of the best ones. Of course that by itself it is not enough, but it is a good way to start if you are interested in the theme, and an essential book to have in your library if you are already studying the History of Political ideas.<br />What is so special about this book, besides the way in which it is written?. The content, of course... Pr&eacute;lot pays attention to the main trends of thought, trying to show us the background against which  they developed, and some of the more characteristic authors of each tendency of political thought. For example, in Ancient Greece he introduces us to the idea of civism, and to some thinkers like Herodotus, Pericles, Jenofonte, Platon and Aristotle.<br />\\"Histoire des id&eacute;es politiques\\" has 47 chapters (besides an introduction and a conclusion), and each of those chapters is organized in the same way: an omnipresent idea, and the way different thinkers react to it. All that, of course, from the point of view of a Frenchman, who might consider that some authors we didn't previously know about are worthy of our attention, thus proceeding to examine them too.<br />On the whole, I consider that this is a great book, and that you are highly likely to love if, provided you speak french.

In the preface to this book, he says that while teaching he was looking forward to learn, and to find the answer regarding some questions that were haunting him. He studied the Liberal Tradition, and payed special attention to re-reading and re-evaluating the books of the main representatives of that tradition.<br />This book is a direct consequence of the time Grondona dedicated to studying the Liberal Tradition. It is conceived as an starting point in order to understand many authors, linked by their preoccupation with freedom, and their contributions to liberalism. The author examines the lives and works of John Locke, Adam Smith, I. Kant, Alexis de Tocqueville, J. S. Mill, J. B. Alberdi, Max Weber, Karl Popper, John Rawls and Robert Nozick, among others.<br />This book is very entertaining and easy to read, but it also leads the reader to the sources, recommending several books of those written by each of the analyzed authors.

I had to read this book for a class regarding History of Latin America, and I found it to be both interesting and helpful.

The task is difficult, but he pulls it off incredibly well. The reader learns, but also enjoys reading &quot;The Spanish Seaborne Empire&quot;, probably because J. H. Parry manages to make histoy appealing. In my opinion, that is the trademark of really good historians.<br />The book includes several illustrations and maps, and it is organized in five parts. Part I is about &quot;The establishment of Empire&quot;, and part II deals with &quot;The responsibilities of Empire&quot; (for example, the spreading of the faith and law enforcement). Part III talks about &quot;The cost of Empire&quot; (demographic catastrophe, economic dependence, etc...), and part IV discusses &quot;The endurance of Empire&quot; (specially its growth and consequent need of reorganisation). Finally, part IV considers &quot;The desintegration of Empire&quot;. The author wraps up the book nicely with a conclusion titled &quot;The aftermath of Empire&quot;.<br />On the whole, I think this is a remarkably good book, that somehow ends up being both useful and readable.

Maybe you won't identify with what happens in many of her comics, but you'll certainly feel others depict quite closely what happens to you or your friends.<br />After having success with her cartoons, she was asked to compile them in books. This is the first of her books in the &quot;Mujeres Alteradas&quot; (&quot;Altered women&quot;) series. In a recent New York Times's article Maitena explained the reason for the title of the series. She said that &quot;To me an altered woman is one who has all of these battlefields open at the same time&quot;. &quot;We've got work, men, maternity, our body, our friends, our mothers, a whole bunch of things, and that's what puts us in an altered state, in which we can go from euphoria to a depressed crying jag in 15 minutes&quot;.<br />I really enjoyed this compilation of cartoons, and I believe you are highly likely to do the same, provided you know at least a little bit of spanish, or are well predisposed to reading it with the help of a small english-spanish/spanish-english dictionary. Having already taken the &quot;language issue&quot; into consideration, I think I can strongly recommend this book to you. I would like to finish this review with a quotation from the article I mentioned above. There Maitena says that &quot;Women are not all the same, but the same things happen to us&quot;. In my opinion, that is the reason why all women (and men interested in knowing more about us) will love this book.<br />Belen Alcat	2004-03-26

Natalio Botana, a well-known argentinian historian and university professor of History and Political Science, wrote \\"El siglo de la libertad y el miedo\\" (\\"The century of freedom and fear\\"), a wonderful book that deals with the XXth century.<br />What makes this book so special?. In my opinion, the fact that the author shares his reflections regarding that century with the readers, making them aware of many things they probably hadn't considered before. What is more, we must take into consideration the curriculum of the author, singularly important in this occasion because it enabled him to write this book as an historian, but also as a political scientist. Botana's book includes not only historic events but also a political analysis regarding them. Furthermore, he explains the ideas of some important political scientists (for example Norberto Bobbio or Guglielmo Ferrero) who lived and sometimes suffered in \\"El siglo de la libertad y el miedo\\". As a result, his book is even more interesting, and its scope more comprehensive.<br />I will copy some phrases that explain the reason of the title of this book. I think nobody can express those reasons better than the author: \\"El siglo de la libertad y el miedo. Por una parte, la libertad, que deb&iacute;a resultar de una s&iacute;ntesis ben&eacute;fica entre los derechos humanos, inscriptos en las constituciones, y la capacidad material y cultural del individuo para realizarlos plenamente; por otra, el miedo que ya no proven&iacute;a del misterio de una naturaleza inh&oacute;spita e incontrolable, con sus dioses vengativos, sino de una f&aacute;brica construida por el propio hombre, cuyo producto era la muerte. Jam&aacute;s en la historia se busc&oacute; con tanto ah&iacute;nco combinar los ideales de la libertad con los de la igualdad y la justicia; jam&aacute;s esa empresa sucumbi&oacute; con tanto estr&eacute;pito en manos del crimen pol&iacute;tico, de la tortura, de la organizaci&oacute;n del poder total y de las matanzas sin fin\\".<br />After that, what else can I say?.

In this book, Jean Long introduces us to Chinese calligraphy. As he explains, even though &quot;calligraphy&quot; only means &quot;words written by hand&quot;, to the Chinese it is an art with a long history. He affirms that &quot;the characters not only convey the language of thought but also, in a visual way, the artistic beauty of the thought&quot;.<br />In the introduction to &quot;The Art of Chinese calligraphy&quot;, the author says that the purpose of the book is allowing the readers to delight in the intrinsic beauty of Chinese calligraphy, even if they haven't yet mastered the Chinese language. Also, J. Long points out that in this book he provides the instructions that allow the readers who want to try their hands at Chinese calligraphy to do so. The instructions include a step by step guide to using the necessary equipment, and all that is needed to learn the different brushwork techniques. Finally, he also expresses his hope that &quot;a greater understanding of the art of Chinese calligraphy will provide a clearer insight into the character of the Chinese people themselves&quot;.<br />The book is very well divided into interesting chapters that are easy to read and contain a lot of information even though they aren't overly long. The 1st chapter is titled &quot;The development of Chinese calligraphy&quot;, and deals with the history of this art. It is worthwhile mentioning that this chapter and all the others include many useful illustrations, specially photographs (for example, a photograph of a ritual vessel from the 10th century BC, inscribed with characters). The 2nd chapter, &quot;Chinese calligraphy as an art form&quot;, explains how it developed to an art form, from the merely functional act of writing. The 3rd chapter is &quot;Language as a way to the understanding of Chinese thought&quot;, and the 4th is &quot;The calligraphic seal&quot;. Chapters 5 and 6 deal with &quot;Chinese porcelain and ceramics&quot; and &quot;Inscriptions on paintings&quot; respectively, and chapter 7 centers on &quot;Chinese painting equipment and how to use it&quot;. Lastly, chapter 8 is about &quot;The techniques of Chinese calligraphy&quot;.<br />When I bought this book I was not exceedingly interested in attempting Chinese calligraphy, but I wanted to know more about it and the importance it has for Chinese culture. I decided to buy &quot;The Art of Chinese calligraphy&quot; because I considered it would be able to answer my questions... And thankfully, I was right!. This book is a great introduction to the subject, and it is highly likely to be useful not only to artists but also to readers like me who don't want to paint but love to learn about other cultures.<br />On the whole, I think this book is a keeper, and I highly recommend it :)<br />Belen&quot; respectively, and chapter 7 centers on &quot;Chinese painting equipment and how to use it&quot;.

Well, I am proud of having read THIS book.<br />\\"Introduction a l'histoire de notre temps (le XXe si&egrave;cle)\\" is one of those books you want to keep and read again in the future, because it changes your view of the past, thus affecting the way in which you understand the present. The author, R&eacute;ne R&eacute;mond, is a well-known french historian. He wrote this book (along with two others, \\"L'Ancien R&eacute;gime et la R&eacute;volution\\" and \\"Le XIXe si&egrave;cle\\") on the basis of the notes for his lectures at the Institute of Political Studies of Paris.<br />R&eacute;mond's book tries to show long term historic tendences, and to distinguish causes and consequences of historical facts (at least as far as that is possible). Despite not being too long, this book manages to delve into many interesting themes, captivating the reader and making him want to know more. R&eacute;mond deals in a straightforward and entertaining manner with quite a few subjects, for example the two world wars, their origins and consequences, the crisis of liberal democracies, communism and fascism, the Cold War, decolonisation, the awakening of Asia, Islam and the arabian world, the \\"other\\" worlds, Europe and \\"the world of tomorrow\\".<br />It is worthwhile pointing out that even if my main aim when I bought this book was to learn more about world history, a side (and not inconsequential) benefit has been being able to enjoy R&eacute;mond's writing style. His prose is fluent, elegant and even poetic sometimes. Learning what you need to know is easier when it is written in such a beautiful way. The task is then rather simple, and much more gratifying.<br />On the whole, highly recommended... Enjoy it :)<br />Belen	2004-03-03

Norberto Bobbio (1909 - 2004) was one of Italy's more important political philosophers. He was deeply respected as a writer and as a teacher, and admired for his contribution to political theory and political debate. One of his obituaries said that \\"to his credit, he founded no school, while influencing many.\\"<br />I wasn't fortunate enough to have him as a professor, but I was able to learn from him through many of his books, and I would like to share that possibility with others. One of his best books is, in my opinion, \\"Teoria de las Formas de Gobierno en la historia\\", first released in an italian edition (\\"La Teoria delle forme di Governo nella storia del pensiero politico\\"), in 1976. This book compiles  the lectures he gave at an university, during the 1975-1976 academic year.<br />In \\"Teoria de las Formas de Gobierno en la historia\\" Bobbio analyses the ideas of some important political thinkers regarding one subject: forms of government. He pays special attention to Plato, Aristotle, Polibio, Maquiavel, Bodin, Hobbes, Vico, Montesquieu, Hegel and Marx, but also delves into the ideas of others who had an important impact in Political Science.<br />The central theme in this book is the different forms of government throughout history, and the search for the perfect form of government. However, in order to impart his knowledge on that subject, Bobbio needs to tell us about the general philosophy of each political thinker. Truth to be told, he manages to do that in a captivating way.<br />After reading this book, you will realize that you have learnt a lot without enduring a boring book. The reason for that is quite clear if we remember that \\"Teoria de las Formas de Gobierno en la historia\\" was in first place a series of lectures. We can easily see that even after those lectures were transcribed the book conserved the vitality and rhythm that generally characterizes really good oral expositions.<br />On the whole I can strongly recommend this book to all those interested in Political Science or History, and also to those who would like to read an interesting and well-written book. For all of you, read, learn and enjoy!!!.<br />Beleninterested in Political Science or History, and also to those who would like to read an interesting and well-written book.

But what is \\"fantasy\\"?. The dictionary says that it is \\"fiction characterized by highly fanciful or supernatural elements\\", but I think that it is also literature that amazes and bewilders us, freeing the reader from reality and introducing him to other worlds, other possibilities...<br />The selection of the short stories included in \\"Antolog&iacute;a de la literatura fant&aacute;stica\\" was made by Jorge Luis Borges, Adolfo Bioy Casares and Silvina Ocampo, three well-known argentinian writers that somehow managed to choose the perfect stories that enabled them to give the reader a good idea of what fantasy is really about. Some of the authors included in this selection are Thomas Carlyle, Julio Cort&aacute;zar, G. K. Chesterton, Chuang Tzu, James Joyce, F. Kafka, Guy de Maupassant, Giovanni Papini, E. A. Poe, Saki, F. Rabelais, A. B. Casares, J. L. Borges, S. Ocampo and H. G. Wells.<br />I really enjoyed this book, and I specially appreciated the fact that it comprises stories written by different authors, because that didn't allow me to get bored. Each author has his distinctive style, and a different way of charming the reader, but all achieve just that. On the whole, reading this book was a wonderful experience, and I can recommend it to you.<br />Belen	2004-02-21

I had to read this book a few years ago for a class at university. A friend lent it to me, and I found it interesting, instructive and easy to read. As a result, I ended up buying it.<br />The author of \\"Estructura econ&oacute;mica internacional\\" (\\"International economic structure\\"), Ram&oacute;n Tamames, is a well-known spanish  economist who teaches at the Autonomous University of Madrid. The 1st  edition of this book was published in 1970, but this is already the 19th edition, and it has been updated to include some of the more important developments in the economic field up to 1999.<br />Tamames tells the reader about the formation process of the international economy, and about the origins of international economic cooperation, without forgetting to pay attention to the different processes of integration that are taking place nowadays. As if that were not enough, he also deals with some issues that have great importance nowadays (like economic fluctuations), and studies the most important economic potencies.<br />The reason for the success of this book is clear. Tamames gives the reader the theoretical basis that is essential to understand the international economic structure, thus allowing him to appreciate better what is happening around him, and act in consequence. If \\"Knowledge is power\\", this book is a good way to empower the average reader who wants to know more about the modern world, and the economic processes that take place in it.<br />On the whole, highly recommended...

This book is very interesting, because the author strives to give the reader the opportunity of understanding the formation (and conformation) of latin american cities and societies, taking into account the way in which the founders and inhabitants of those cities thought. Romero follows the development of those cities, their societies and the ideas present in them, from the XVth century to the XXth  century. He does that in a seemingly effortless way, enchanting the reader and allowing him to understand the inner dynamic of change in those cities.<br />The author of \\"Latinoamerica - Las Ciudades y Las Ideas\\" pays enormous attention to historical facts, but also delves deeply into literature, art, architecture and history of political ideas. As a result, he manages to give the reader a comprehensive and accurate picture of latin american cities in different periods of time, and that allows the reader to appreciate better the transformations that those cities and societies suffered through time. Romero says that \\"Las ciudades se hicieron reales tomando conciencia de la regi&oacute;n en que estaban insertas\\", and tries to show us that process.<br />The book is well organized and clearly divided in chapters regarding the subject. For example, chapter 1 is about \\"Latinoam&eacute;rica en la expansi&oacute;n europea\\", chapter 2 refers to \\"El ciclo de las fundaciones\\", chapter 3 studies \\"Las ciudades hidalgas de indias\\", chapter 4 \\"Las ciudades criollas\\", chapter 5 \\"Las ciudades patricias\\", chapter 6 \\"Las ciudades burguesas\\" and chapter 7 \\"Las ciudades masificadas\\". The bibliography is also remarkably good, and that is in my opinion very important, because it allows the reader to go on reading about the themes he felt more interested in.<br />I believe this book can be recommended to those interested in Latin America, and also to the curious reader who doesn't know too much about this part of the world but is willing (and eager) to learn about it. The only drawback might be the fact that \\"Latinoamerica - Las Ciudades y Las Ideas\\" is written in Spanish... However, if you don't speak the language you can always learn it, don't you think?.

Sir Harold Nicolson, the autor of this book, was a prestigious british diplomat who served on the British delegation to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, among other tasks. He knew his craft, and wanted to share that knowledge with others. That is probably the reason why he wrote this book, \\"Diplomacy\\".<br />In \\"Diplomacy\\", not only does he tell the reader about the origin of diplomacy and its development: he also manages to explain what being a diplomat is about, and which qualifications should aspiring diplomats have. For example, he believes that veracity, precision, calm, loyalty, good character and modesty are essential attributes of a good diplomat.<br />Nicolson wrote \\"Diplomacy\\" a long time ago: the first edition was published in 1939. Notwithstanding that, his book is nowadays as useful as in the day it was published, because it allows the reader to understand what diplomacy is, from the point of view of a diplomat. This book is informative, but also entertaining. His eloquent prose attracts the reader, who cannot help but be interested by the many anecdotes regarding life in the Foreign Service that the author recollects in order to get his point across more clearly.<br />In conclusion, I can recommend this book to those who are interested in International Relations and would like to know more about diplomacy. I give it only four stars because even if it is a very good book, it doesn't include the latest developments in the diplomatic field. All the same, it is a really good place to start :)<br />Bel&eacute;n	2004-02-14

If you like fantasy books and haven't been lucky enough to read other books written by Pierce you will discover a great new author. But if you are already a fan of the author, I can assure you something: these books won't change your opinion of her skills.<br />In a way, it is more of the same, with a different plot, but lots of adventure, magic, humour and action. &quot;The Immortals&quot; is also set in Pierce's Tortall, and if you have read her &quot;Song of the Lioness&quot; series you will have the possibility of meeting old friends again, for example Alanna, George, King Jonathan and Queen Thayet, Raoul and Duke Gareth.<br />Notwithstanding that, there are also new characters, the most important one being Daine, an orphan girl who is 13 years old and can communicate with animals, because she has &quot;Wild magic&quot;. As we read the books, we go along with her in her long and difficult journey to master her skills, and make peace with what and who she is. Her teacher will be a powerful mage, Numair, and her friends a large number and sometimes a little strange, because due to her powers she isn't confined to make friends among the &quot;two-leggers&quot;.<br />One of the advantages of buying the box set is that by doing so you can have all the books at hand, thus being able to start another book as soon as you finish the previous one without having to run to buy it. And believe me, you will enjoy them so much that is highly likely that you would do exactly that, if you were to buy them one by one. Moreover, buying them in the box set is cheaper :)<br />I started reading Tamora Pierce when I was 12, but I still read many of her books from time to time, even though I am quite a bit older now. The reason?. Pierce's books are great for teens, but some adults also enjoy them. I guess it is more or less what happens with Harry Potter's books, loved by children, teens and adults that have young hearts.<br />All in all, I highly recommend these books, as enjoyable reading material that will make you smile.

Because it is one of those few books that allows you to achieve several objectives at the same time... It can introduce the reader to art, or allow him to continue with his studies. It gives him the opportunity of learning, but also entertains and captivates him.<br />Yes, of course that it is long, and because of that somehow scary the first time you see it. But if you manage to start it, you will find that you will finish it in no time at all. The reason for that is the author, E.H. Gombrich. His prose is fluent, and easy to understand, but what is more important, he doesn't merely enumerate facts: he tries to explain them, setting them in a historical background. And by doing that, compels and engages the reader, making him think about art and its \\"evolution\\", and about why the story of art is \\"A story without end\\".<br />The book brings a lot of illustrations regarding the artworks discussed by the author, including several fold-outs that I appreciated enormously. The reproductions allow the reader to \\"see\\" what the author tries to explain, and make the book even more dynamic.<br />Now in its 16th updated edition, this book is already a classic. Maybe the reason for that popularity can be explained by the author. Gombrich's aim was to help others to understand art, from cave painting to postmodern art. He believes that his book is immensely liked by students and art-lovers because \\"it has made them see how the story of art hangs together\\".<br />On the whole, I highly recommend \\"The story of art\\" to everybody interested in art. I believe it is exactly what you need :)<br />Bel&eacute;n	2004-02-05

In &quot;L'ultima lacrima&quot; (&quot;The last tear&quot;), Stefano Benni somehow manages to convey his view of our society, thanks to a fluent prose that manages to attract the reader, despite being utterly caustic, overwhelmingly ironic.<br />Can the stories contained in this book be compelling, in spite of being abrasive and acerbic?. The answer to this question is yes, they can. Because they point to us things that we already know, but cannot express correctly, clearly. Benni does just that.<br />This book is not for those who are contented with everything that surrounds them, having lost their capacity of being critical, of challenging the established order. Instead, it is for the readers that like to analyse their society, resisting the temptation to accept the current state of things as fixed and immovable, merely because it is widely accepted.<br />The stories vary greatly. Some, like &quot;Il ladro&quot;, could have happened nowadays. Others, for example &quot;Un cattivo scolaro&quot;, are set in a distant future. Notwithstanding that, all these stories have something in common: they help to develop the understanding of the reader, and provide him with tools to comprehend better what is happening around him.<br />On the whole, I strongly recommend this book. It is enjoyable, but it also has an immediate applicability to real life, because it helps you to see more clearly what is wrong with our society.<br />Bel&eacute;n	2004-01-29

Brasil has always had a very important place in Argentina's foreign policy. However, even if Brasil has managed to retain its relevance, there has been some changes, clearly evident nowadays.<br /><br />Before Argentina saw its neighbor as a threat, now we see Brasil as an ally. A good relationship between the two countries is now of the utmost importance for both of them.<br /><br />That is, exactly, what this book points out, as a conclusion. But in order to arrive to that, the authors study the history of the relationships between Argentina and Brasil, paying special attention at how the internal situation in Argentina affected them (from 1880 to 2002).<br /><br />Roberto Russell and Juan Tokatlian also explain how that history can be easily understood through three paradigms. First, the paradigm of the \\"special relationship with Great Britain\\", followed by the \\"globalist\\" paradigm, and finally that of \\"pragmatic acquiescence\\". Furthermore, they propose a new paradigm of foreign policy, that's likely to bring good results: that of \\"responsible participation\\". That paradigm is likely to involve a redefinition of autonomy.<br /><br />On the whole, I think that this is a very good book, and I can recommend it to you.

This book, &quot;Constitucion de La Nacion Argentina Comentada y Concordada&quot;, is wonderful, even if with over 1100 pages it's quite long. It's rather expensive, but I'd buy it again, because it is well worth it.<br />The book includes not only the argentinian Constitution, but also accurate comments and in-depth analysis by Maria Angelica Gelli, an specialist in the field of Constitutional Law. Even if you are not familiar with the subject at hand (and I wasn't) you will be able to understand everything easily, because despite the fact that the author always makes a point of citing jurisprudence (not only from Argentina, but also from other countries and International Courts), she does that didactically.<br />Also noteworthy is that in this edition of her book Maria Angelica Gelli delves into the politic, economic and institucional argentinian crisis, and tries to evaluate it from the solutions that are possible, taking into account a constitutional point of view. So, she doesn't merely try to convey to the reader what our constitution is about, she also aspires to make him understand the circumstances in which that constitution is supposed to fulfill its purpose.<br />As a result, if you read this book, not only will you understand better what our Constitution is about, you'll also have at least a glimpse of a sociological perspective. Gelli probably didn't need to explain what was the &quot;cacerolazo&quot; to write a good book on the argentinian Constitution. But by doing that, and many things more, she wrote a wonderful book, that I recommend to all those interested in Argentina.	2004-01-24

The cartoonist that draws Gaturro (the cat on the front cover of the book) is called &quot;Nik&quot;, and is quite well known in Argentina, his country.<br />Nik works for &quot;La Naci&oacute;n&quot; ([...] one of Argentina's more important newspapers, and is also well known for the fact that his political cartoons often offer accurate (and acid) comments regarding Argentina's political scene.<br />As a matter of fact, Gaturro started to appear in Nik's &quot;political cartoons&quot;, when he took notice of a new capilar implant in the head of president Menem, and thus started to draw a cat on his head (in Argentina, &quot;gato&quot;(cat)is a familiar and ironic name for a capilar implant). The cat slowly began to take protagonism, with little sharp comments on whatever was happening in the political scene, and finally got a cartoon of his own.<br />The cartoons are in spanish, but the language is quite simple, so if you are curious enough and cannot speak the language, you'll be able to manage (provided you have a good dictionary). Gaturro is amusing and clever, sometimes absurd but always entertaining. Read this book and you'll have lots of fun :)	2004-01-19

The reason?: it's not overly long, and it includes lots of useful phrases that the student often forgets. It's also extremely well ordered by subjects, and it includes some illustrations that are helpful.<br />On the whole, I strongly recommend it, not only for students, but also for tourists that want to know at least some phrases in the language of the country they are visiting.	2004-01-19

Somehow, this books manages to give us a very good idea of what happened in that time span, without boring us to death at the same time, and that is not a small merit.<br />&quot;Diplomacy&quot; was written from the point of view of Henry Kissinger, a controversial man who was secretary of State of USA. Whatever might be said about him, something cannot be dennied: he knows his craft. And in &quot;Diplomacy&quot; he makes that evident, exactly as he had done previously in other books, for example in &quot;The World Restored: Metternich, Castlereagh, and the Problems of Peace&quot;.<br />His prose is quite elegant, but at the same time easy to read. Kissinger mixtures historical facts with his personal opinions, dissecting what happened and trying to draw conclusions that allow the reader to discern long term trends in history, thus enabling him/her to really understand what happened.<br />I bought this book a long time ago, but I still consider it a keeper. It isn't exhaustive, but it doesn't pretend to be so... On the whole, a book worth buying and having. Recommended :)	2004-01-12

Nye says that the aim of the book is \\"to introduce students to the complexities of international politics by giving them a good grounding in the traditional realist theory before turning to liberal and constructivist approaches that became more prominent after the Cold War\\". I believe he excels at doing exactly that...<br />I found the book very interesting, and full of examples taken from history that made the concepts easier to grasp. Moreover, it takes into account the three levels of causation: the individual, the state and the international system. It also includes suggested reading material, that allows the reader to delve deeper in those subjects she/he finds more interesting...<br />The book is very well organized. It was a foreword, a preface, 9 chapters and an index. Each chapter deals with a main theme, and some related topics. The themes of the chapters are:<br /><br />chapter 1:\\"Is there an enduring logic of conflict in world politics?\\";<br />chapter 2: \\"Origins of the great 20th century conflicts\\";<br />chapter 3: \\"Balance of power and World War I\\";<br />chapter 4: \\"The failure of collective security and World War II\\";<br />chapter 5: \\"The Cold War\\";<br />chapter 6: \\"Intervention, institutions and regional and ethnic conflicts\\";<br />chapter 7: \\"Globalization and interdependence\\";<br />chapter 8: \\"The information revolution, transnational actors, and the diffusion of power\\";<br />chapter 9: \\"A new world order?\\".<br />All in all, I strongly recommend this book to those interested in international relations... I think the author was successful in doing what he set out to do: he didn't want to give all the answers, he merely tried to help the readers to look for them. In his own words: \\"provide our students with conceptual tools that will help them shape their own answers as the future unfolds\\".<br />On the whole, a keeper :)  Enjoy it !!!help them shape their own answers as the future unfolds\\".<br />On the whole, a keeper :)  Enjoy it !!!	2003-12-08

I think this book is interesting and important reading material for those who want to understand what is happening nowadays, and why USA \\"can't go it alone\\".<br />  Nye says, among other things, that the world is no longer the realm of an unipolar power (USA). According to him, it is necessary to distinguish three dimensions of power.<br />  The first dimension is interstate military issues, and it is dominated by USA. We can say that this dimension of power is unipolar. However, there are other dimensions: the economic one, and the dimension regarding transnational issues.<br />  The economic dimension of power deals with interstate economic issues, and has many important actors (for example the EU, Japan, and other relevant players). Nye highlights the fact that this second dimension is multipolar: USA needs the cooperation of other states, in order to achive  its objectives.<br />  Finally, the third dimension takes into account transnational issues such as global warming and and terrorism. In this case the structure of power is disperse, and the number of relevant state and nonstate increases exponentially.<br />  Joseph Nye Jr. also says that the importance of the military dimension, that involves hard power, is likely to diminish in the future. On the other hand, he predicts that the relevance of the other two dimensions, more soft power oriented, is going to increase, due to many factors (for example, the information revolution). However, a state has to take into account not only soft power but also hard power in order to achieve success in its policies.<br />He also tries to make the idea of the three dimensions of power more easily understandable by comparing power to a three-dimensional chessboard, where you have to play in the three dimensions if you want to win. The problem, according to him, is that USA is increasingly paying attention only to the military dimension of power, and due to that it is likely to have more than a few problems in the long term. A onedimensional player in a three dimensional game can only lose...<br />On the whole, a very good book that can help you to understand better what is happening today ...

A long time ago, my teacher recommended me to read this book, because it was a great introduction to Borges. She was right: I loved it, and due to that was curious enough to go on reading other books written by him.<br />&quot;El Hacedor&quot; includes several short stories and some poems. All of them are quite different, but deeply original. My favorite is a poem called &quot;Poema de los dones&quot;, where he tries to convey the great irony of the fact that he was made director of Argentina's National Library just when he was losing his sight. Poignant, caustic, but so &quot;Borges&quot;, this poem is one of the best ones I've read. I'll copy part of it, so you can have an idea of what it is like:<br /><br />  &quot;Nadie rebaje a l&aacute;grima o reproche<br />  esta declaraci&oacute;n de la maestr&iacute;a<br />  de Dios, que con magn&iacute;fica iron&iacute;a<br />  me dio a la vez los libros y la noche.<br /><br />  De esta ciudad de libros hizo due&ntilde;os<br />  a unos ojos sin luz, que s&oacute;lo pueden<br />  leer en las bibliotecas de los sue&ntilde;os<br />  los insensatos p&aacute;rrafos que ceden<br />  las albas a su af&aacute;n.

This book gives a very good introduction to Argentina's contemporary history. Even though it isn't long, it is remarkably thorough and well documented.<br />Luis Alberto Romero is a very well known argentinian historian, author of other good books. Despite that, this is the one I prefer, at least so far. Notwithstanding the fact that it deals mainly with historical facts, it also includes his interpretation regarding what happened.<br />The structure of the book is quite simple, but really useful and eminently practical. After a short introduction, the author starts this book with Yrigoyen's first presidential term (1916 - 1922), continues with Alvear's presidency and then carries on with Yrigoyen's unfinished second term.<br />He delves deeply into the conservative restoration (1930-1943), and then tries to explain what Per&oacute;n meant to Argentina, and the reaction that his presidency produced. From then on, democratic governments would be constantly interrupted by revolts, and the military would have the final word regarding all matters of importance in Argentina. That, until the Malvina's defeat, which ended up in the collapse of the military regime, and the beginning of a fledging democracy... Romero concludes this book by telling us what Argentina is like nowadays, in his opinion.<br />On the whole, I think this is an exceptionally good book, superbly well written and easily understandable. I recommend it strongly: it's a keeper !!!  :)	2003-10-17
US	50950064	R32EWWUWMYSTRF	0553212788	604725626	The Prince (Bantam Classics)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A classic ...	&quot;The Prince&quot; is one of the classics you cannot do without, if you want to understand the dynamics of power. Here, Machiavelli tells us how to achieve (and mantain) power.<br />This short book is profoundly innovative, because Machiavelli leaves aside everything that is not directly relevant to political theory, thus giving the opportunity for the birth of an autonomous political science. Previously, considerations  of rigth and wrong were deeply connected with debates regarding power, the good prince or the perfect regime.  After &quot;The Prince&quot; that wasn't necessarily true anymore.<br />Machiavelli believed that, in order to be able to study correctly political facts and events, he needed to get rid of the illusions that had clouded the vision of previous generations (for example, the possibility of eliminating evil). In that respect, he could be described as the first truly modern thinker.<br />Sheldon Wolin says that Machiavelli gave the new science of the art of ruling as an alternative to the old principle of legitimacy, promising that he could make &quot;a new prince look old&quot;. In that respect, &quot;The Prince&quot; was groundbreaking...<br />There are many more ideas in &quot;The Prince&quot; you might find interesting, even if you don't agree with them. Strange as it may seem, this book is as relevant today as it was the day it was written. Of course, some parts of it are outdated, but others might help you to understand the way some leaders behave.<br />In my opinion, that is the main contribution of &quot;The Prince&quot;. It helped giving political theory a new direction,yes, but it also allows us to understand a little better what is happening nowadays. I think that is the crucial mission of political books: help us to understand the world, in order to be able to improve it later.<br />My advise?: read it --&gt; it is a classic that somehow has managed to maintain its edge :)	2003-10-17
US	50950064	RVA5V0PX9QTJU	0521559103	38442641	Sorel: Reflections on Violence (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)	Books	5	22	23	N	N	The power of  myths, the importance of choosing wisely	&quot;Reflections on violence&quot; was written in 1908 by Georges Sorel, and gives us a good idea of what revolutionary syndicalism was like to him. Even if this book isn't widely read, it is quite important in the history of political ideas.<br /><br /> &quot;Reflections on Violence&quot; is a little difficult to read sometimes, because it was the result of many articles that the author had written regarding many subjects. When he finally put them together he didn't rewrite them, because he believed that to be good, reading must be an exercise that implies a certain amount of work. Well, as a matter of fact he achieved that aim, but all the same the book is well worth the effort.<br /><br /> In &quot;Reflections on violence&quot; Sorel gives great importance to the idea of social myth, because according to him, myths can lead everybody's energy towards a given aim. In his opinion, there is an enormous difference between myths and utopias, due to the fact that myths don't only describe an ideal, but try to reach it. Through utopia you tear yourself from the world, with a myth you transform it (and transforming it you find yourself, because man is creative activity).<br /><br /> Sorel thinks that myths are not rational, and because of that they cannot be judged intellectually. One of the myths he studies is the myth of the general strike. He believed that particular myth could give the proletariat (through syndicalism) enough strenght to fight against the bourgeoisie. Sorel also affirms that violence is positive, because while force gives the workers chains, the violence directed at that force frees them.<br /><br /> In conclusion, I must say I liked this book. When he highlights the importance of myth, I guess he also somehow stresses the tendency human beings have to dedicate their life to an ideal, a cause. And that ideal is likely to be of the utmost importance to us, because our beliefs make us. That is the reason why it is so important to choose the right ideal, the right cause.<br /><br /> The problem is that Sorel doesn't measure the truth of each myth, but merely its efficacy, and by doing so opens the way for all kind of disasters. How can we expect even a little bit of rationality from social life if the ultimate end of that life cannot be evaluated rationally?. And if we cannot understand intellectually our aim (the myth), how can we realise if it is legitimate?. If you can, read this book... It'll make you think !!!<br /><br /> Belen AlcatThe problem is that Sorel doesn't measure the truth of each myth, but merely its efficacy, and by doing so opens the way for all kind of disasters.

Natalio Botana says that \\"every political regime has an implicit logic\\", and tries to delve into the logic of a period (1880 - 1916) that was very important in what regards to the fundation of modern Argentina.<br />During that period the conservative regime was consolidated. According to Alberdi's formula, everybody had civil and economic rights, but only some (the elite) had political rights.Thus, two kinds of republic coexisted: the open and the restrictive republic.<br />Botana tells us a lot about this period, and he also talks about the ideas of many political thinkers (such as Rousseau, Tocqueville, Alberdi, etc...) while he tries to make us understand the essential features of the conservative regime. For example, he says that we can find a relation between the comparation Alberdi draws regarding the open and the restrictive republic and Rousseau's view about what is a citizen and what merely and inhabitant.<br />Anyway, I can recommend this book to all those who like a good book, superbly well written and regarding an interesting subject.

The action takes place in N. York (USA), in the year 2058. Obviously, many things are different (more technology, some weapons are outlawed, prostitution is legal), but others are not. One of the things that doesn't change is that even in the future there are murderers, and policemen to take them to jail.<br />Our main character is Lt. Eve Dallas, a homicide detective in Manhattan very good at her job of \\"standing for the dead\\", and who dedicates herself totally to her job in order to avoid her past. She is also averse to having a meaningful relationship with anybody, because she doesn't want to be vulnerable again.<br />However, one of her criminal investigations (the gruesome murder of a licenced companion, who happens to be related to a very powerful senator) leads her to a suspect that she cannot help but being attracted to. That is Roarke, a stunningly handsome billionaire with a shady past, who is the main suspect in her criminal case. The victim knew him, was murdered in one of his buildings, with a weapon he could have had access to (he has a collection of antique guns). She tries to maintain objectivity, but Roarke won't allow her to do that, as he is also incredibly attracted to this stubborn detective with one weakness: real coffe.<br />What will happen? Will Eve be able to stop the murderer, who has promised to kill 5 more licenced companions? And is Roarke innocent? The answers to this and a lot more can be found in this book. I'm rather sure you will love it, because it has both mystery and romance, an intelligent plot and characters you end up delighting in. Anyway, GOOD READING!!!.	2003-06-23

In \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\", we see all our friends again.<br />After a very boring summer with the Dudley's without news from his friends (at least not interesting news), Harry is attacked by 2 dementors (he makes them run). That will lead to all kinds of events, the most important probably being that Dumbledore sends for him, and he gets to know the place where the Order of the Fenix meets.<br />Harry is 15, and he is already an adolescent. Besides having to deal with all that means (for example bursts of temper, feeling that nobody understands you, not understanding girls), he must worry about Lord Voldemort. Not only that: the Daily Prophet (the magic world's newspaper) has been strongly implying that he is crazy, or at the very least delusional, and that brings him problems with many people.<br />That is in part due to the influence of Fudge, minister of magic, who doesn't believe (or doesn't want to believe)that Voldemort has returned from the dead, and has turned against those who, like Harry and Dumbledore, are prepared to face the facts. Trying to limit Dumbledore influence in the magic world, Fudge sends Dolores Umbridge to Hogwarts as his envoy, and she slowly tries to take power from the headmaster. Umbridge, senior undersecretary to the Minister of Magic, becomes teacher of Defense Against Dark Arts, and then also High Inquisitor of Hogwarts.<br />This book shows also how, in his fifth year at Hogwarts, the all important OWLs (Ordinary Wizarding Levels examinations)approach, and Harry's, Hermione's and Ron's dilemma regarding one of the subjects of that exam, Defense Against Dark Arts, because their teacher (Umbridge) refuses to let them practice the spells they are supposed  to know. That brings us to a secret club, in which Harry teaches others, as a result from an idea of Hermione. Are they caught or not? Is their practise useful? --> Read the book :)<br />We see how Harry grows as a character, and the way in which he deals with the unpleasant things others say about him and certain facts he would rather not know. We get to know a little more about Neville (I like the way he overcomes his fear to help his friends), Ginny (who is much more interesting now that she isn't in love with Harry, thus being able to talk more than 2 words without stammering)and the Weasley's (love the twins). Is it me or there is romance in the air for Ron and Hermione in future books? I guess will see...<br />Harry gets to know more about himself, about his friends and enemies. He has to deal with great grief, but has also reason to smile. In the whole, a great book...

Burgin's ambition was to shed come light on the importance of the economic aspects of Argentine Federalism. He writes quite fluently, and even though he gives lots of data, he somehow manages to surprise the reader, from time to time, with an appreciably good remark. He thinks that there is a noteworthy connection between the original institutional problem and the deficient economic structure of the country, and supports that belief with facts and intelligent considerations.<br />On the whole, a very good book, that I can recommend to those that are interested in Argentina's history.	2003-06-20

If so, this is one of the books you must have. Why? Simply because it makes your life easier.<br />This book doesn't explain why verbs are conjugated in a certain way, but it helps you to learn merely by showing how 501 french verbs are conjugated. Is that enough? Well, by itself no, because we are not parrots who must repeat whatever they are told without understanding what they say (that, despite the opinion of some, not all, french teachers). However, if you have a good textbook, a terrific dictionary, some listening tapes and &quot;501 French Verbs: Fully Conjugated in All the Tenses in a New Easy-To-Learn Format Alphabetically Arranged&quot; (long title :)!!), you'll probably end up speaking french more or less well.<br />This edition is bilingual (french-english), so if you don't know the meaning of some verbs in french you'll still have the translation in english. Another thing worth pointing out is that each verb has lots of examples (with different tenses). I found out that to be particularly useful...<br />So, what to do?. If you can, buy this book, or ask a friend to lend it to you. It is not overly entertaining (as a matter of fact it is quite boring), but it helps you to deal with some of those awful verbs that sometimes make you wish for the nonexistence of the french language.

Anita Blake, who is not only a vampire slayer (legally, of course) but also a necromancer, is offered a million dollars to raise a 300-year-old zombie. Despite the big amount of money (and the protests of her boss), she declines the offer, because she knows that to raise such an old zombie she would need a human sacrifice (and that is a crime, even in the future when this books takes place). Her \\"would be client\\" (Mr. Gaynor) doesn't like it, but has to accept it. The problem is that some really strange murders start to happen, and Anita, who helps the police as a preternatural expert, thinks they are comitted by a crazy zombie. Could somebody else have raised Gaynor's zombie, losing control of it?. That is the question that Anita will try to answer, while she runs into the most strange people, including Dominga Salvador, a powerful voodoo priestess (who later, of course, tries to kill her).<br />\\"The Laughing Corpse\\" is a very good book, that brings you a lot of fun and takes you into a world where vampires and werewolfs are also legal citizens.

For example, if a country spends too much money in order to increase his its military power (renforcing its political power), it will surely undermine its economic power (the original source of the other two).<br /><br /> In his opinion, the great powers are those states who can reach the best balance of military and economic strength, and he also thinks that as soon as they lose that ability they lose their place to another great power.<br /><br /> Kennedy shows us how this relationship has worked throughout time, and how much it has influenced on the balance of power between countries. He specifically studies the period from 1500 to the mid - 1980's, and even though he might concentrate too much on Europe (as he warns beforehand), he gets his point across quite well.<br /><br /> Some of Kennedy's predictions weren't accurate: he predicted the fall of USA as a great power, and believed that Japan would take its place. What is more, he wasn't able to foresee the fall of the Soviet Union, a few years after his book was published.<br /><br /> However, his ideas and his theory are quite good, and still valid, as is his warning regarding the danger of *Imperial overestretch* to the great powers (specifically USA).<br /><br /> I recommend this book to those who want to understand what is happening today. Even if it is somehow dated, many of its premises are still valid, and the historical perspective is almost flawless.<br /><br /> Belen Alcat	2003-05-18

Robb's futuristic \\"In death\\" series. If you haven't read the previous books in the series, please start by the first one, \\"Naked in death\\", and continue reading them in order. If you do that, I promise you that you will enjoy the series much more.<br /><br />Now, and regarding this book, did I like it? The answer is simple, yes. Do I think I did the right thing purchasing it? Again, yes, because it is entertaining and certainly a keeper. The plot was good, and Eve and Roarke are, as always, a wonderful couple. There is a good whoddunnit, and we discover a mystery that has to do with Roarke's family, a secret that shakes Roarke so much that he closes up to Eve and puts their relationship in danger.<br /><br />Despite all that, I do not think that this book was outstanding when compared to the other books in the series. Anyway, for those who are fans of J.D.Robb , \\"Portrait in death\\" will be a welcome addition to your library. It brings quite a strange role reversal: in this opportunity is Eve who takes care of Roarke while he tries to come to terms with some revelations regarding his past (more specifically his mother). There is also a good crime story, about a killer who chooses his victims due to their beauty, follows them and murders them, never forgetting to photograph them just after he slays them, believing that by doing that he will own their beauty and innocence forever.<br /><br />So, if you have already read some of J.D. Robb's books I recommend you to buy \\"Portrait in death\\" too, because you are highly likely to enjoy it. I know I did  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2003-05-10

In this book, the story of Ayla and Jondalar continues.<br />Ayla is a young Cro-Magnon cavewoman raised by Neanderthals, who are despised by the Cro-Magnon. Her story begins for us in \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\", where Auel tells us about Ayla's life with the Neanderthals. Personally,I didn't like that book (Ayla was very unhappy, and she wasn't treated well by the people who raised her when her parents died, except maybe for Iza and Creb), but I know that it might be good to read it before the others, as it provides a good setting for the story.<br />In \\"The Valley of Horses\\" (2nd book in the series) Ayla lives alone after being expelled from her Clan (she was cursed and pronounced dead!!!). There she meets Jondalar, a handsome Cro- Magnon she saves from death (read it, and then tell me what you think about the idea of having a lion called \\"Baby\\" as a pet !!! :) ).<br />In the third book of the series, \\"The Mammoth Hunters\\", Ayla and Jondalar meet more people like them (something completely normal to Jondalar, but very strange to Ayla, who had thought she was an anomaly). Ayla's powers as a healer are tested (as it is her relationship with Jondalar), and she also earns respect because of her shamanistic and hunting abilities. She overcomes the prejudices aroused because she was reared by the \\"flathead\\" (Neanderthals), and end up with the affection of her new friends.<br />Despite liking the mamutoi, Ayla and Jondalar eventually start again they journey to Jondalar's home. Their adventures are told to us in the 4th book of these series, \\"The Plains of passage\\".<br />Finally, we have this book, \\"The shelters of stone\\", where Ayla and Jondalar arrive to Jondalar's home. We are told many things, for example what does Ayla have to cope with in a new environment. However, on the whole the zelandoniis gave her a good welcome (except some that are not really important, as<br />Marona, Jondalar's jilted fianc&eacute;e, who he didn't love enough to marry). Ayla has to deal again with prejudice against the clan, but she is able to do so (in some degree due to Jondalar's love for her, in some degree due to her guts and the respect she commands for her peculiar abilities as a healer and regarding animals).<br />I really like all these books (except for the first). Even though some reviewers hate the fact that Auel gives (and repeats) too many details regarding the period (she is an anthropologist), I don't particularly mind that. I believe that gives these books and aura of authenticity they wouldn't have otherwise. In my opinion, the \\"Earth's Children Series\\" is highly original, and gives everybody an opportunity to \\"visit\\" the Ice age (I'm quite eager to read the 6th book!!!).<br />On the other hand, the price for this book (the 5th) is just too high, so my recommendation would be: read it, but try to wait for the paperback :)alar´s jilted fiancée, who he didn´t love enough to marry).

US	50950064	R2KL739I7RXVPI	0004722140	639989834	Collins Dictionary of Quotations	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Wonderful compilation !!!!	This is one of those books everybody should have... It is funny, and often insightful. It also gives you an idea of what different people believe about many subjects, and leaves you somewhat envious because you cannot help but wish you could express yourself as clearly and seemingly effortlessly as them.<br />There are quotations on a lot of subjects, and they all differ greatly: some make you laugh, other lead you to think. I specially like the quotations that are permeated by ironic wit.<br />Some are truly remarkable, for example:<br />* \\"Ambition\\": one of the quotations is the answer that Daniel Webster gave, when he was advised not to join the overcrowded legal profession: \\"There is always room at the top\\" :)<br />* \\"the Army\\": Henry Kissinger said(accurately and clearly) that \\"The conventional army loses if it does not win. The guerilla wins if it does not lose\\".<br />* \\"Belief\\": one of Cardinal Newman (\\"We can believe what we choose. We are answerable for what we choose to believe\\") and one of Bertrand Russel (who on being asked if he would be willing to die for his beliefs said \\"Of course not. After all, I may be wrong\\").<br />* Lastly, one on \\"Boredom\\" (I could go on copying my favorite quotations forever, but... you should read the book): Warren Austin, on being asked if he found long debates at the UN tiring, said that \\"It is better for aged diplomats to be bored than for young men to die\\".<br />As you see, reading quotations is quite entertaining, and learning from them even more so. If you can buy this book (or ask somebody to lend it to you), you won't have regrets.	2003-04-08

It had a big influence on the French Revolution, and in many movements after it that considered that the individual owes everything to the state.<br />After reading this book you will be astounded by the insight that Rousseau (1712-1778) showed.  He explains us, among other things, the reason for the formation of political society, and the origin of the social contract.<br />I believe this is a good book to start a study on political ideas. It is simple and well written, it has had an important political impact and can make you curious enough to know more. If you are interested, read also a book about the history of political ideas (for example the one written by George Sabine), because it can guide you to other interesting books, and can give you a deeper insight into the ideas, circumstances and life of Rousseau.	2003-03-18
US	50950064	R3KAEG78KMXPB5	0671569023	965929735	Orchid	Books	5	9	9	N	N	I want more !...:)	\\"Orchid\\" can be read either on its own or after reading \\"Amaryllis\\" and \\"Zinnia\\" (see my reviews on those books), and it is exactly as great as them.<br />To sum up, this novel is a wonderful futuristic paranormal romance written by Jayne Castle (also known as Jayne Ann Krentz). To enjoy it you will need some (or a lot of)imagination: the plot is set in the colony of St. Helens, where the pioneers from Earth that settled there were stranded after the connection between Earth and St. Helens disappeared (+ or - 200 years before the beginning of this story), and people have developed psychic abilities unknown in Earth (but needed by them to survive in a new world). Anyway, given that, you will enjoy a wonderful novel.<br /> The main characters are Orchid Adams and Rafe Stonebraker. Rafe Stonebraker is a highly talented strat, who is looking for a wife. His search (or hunt) will take him to Orchid Adams, a full spectrum ice prism who seems to be all wrong, but feels right... The plot includes also some investigations and a lot of really good love scenes. You cannot help but be involved in this novel. Seemingly bizarre at first (specially if you haven't read \\"Amaryllis\\" or \\"Zinnia\\" before starting with \\"Orchid\\"), it bewitches the reader...<br />You end up wanting more. I've just bought \\"After Dark\\", by the same author. Hope it is as good as this one!!!.	2003-03-17

The name is quite long but explains well what this novel is about. It can be read as a sequel to \\"Amaryllis\\" or on its own. It takes place in the Earth colony of St. Helens, were people are divided between those with psychic powers (talents) and those who can help them to focus those powers, thus increasing them (prisms).<br />The main characters in this book are Nick Chastain, a powerful matrix talent and casino owner, and Zinnia Spring, a full spectrum prism. They meet because Zinnia thinks Nick kidnapped one of her clients,a stormy beginning for an exciting relationship. What follows is a mad chase for a missing journal, and a developing love story that keeps you enthralled...<br />I really loved this book, and consider it to be a real keeper !!!. I only regret it wasn't longer... If you have at least some imagination (a necessary ingredient in this kind of book, read it now: you won't regret doing so!!!	2003-03-17
US	50950064	R3H88OXYICNKNJ	0671021435	567915716	Amaryllis	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Highly recommended  :)	Even though this book was published quite some time ago, I only read it this weekend, due to the recommendation of one of my Amazon.com friends. If it hadn't been for her recommendation, I don't think I would have tried it, because the whole plot of this futuristic romance seemed a little far-fetched.<br />But then, if I hadn't read it I would have missed a real keeper, so I guess I'm very lucky for having friends who share my tastes, and who know what I might like even before I do.<br />The story is set in the Earth colony of St. Helen's, and the main characters are two very different. Amaryllis Lark is a prism, and she can help people who have psychic talents to focus them. She works for Psynergy, Inc., and is quite happy with her job. One of the tasks she must perform is help Lucas, the owner of Lodestar Exploration, to find a corporate thief. She does exactly that, by focusing his talent (remember that Amaryllis is a prism, this is more extensely explained in the book). Even they are very different, they find  that they are intensely attracted to each other, and that atraction only increases as the case they investigate develops to include murder.<br />Jayne Castle is the name that Jayne Ann Krentz uses when she writes futuristic paranormal romances. I can only tell that she is incredible! After finishing this book, I immediately searched in the web for the sequels, \\"Zinnia\\" and \\"Orchid\\", and by now I've already read both of them (they are also great, 5 star rating). This \\"compulsion\\" to read everything similar that the author may have written is what distinguishes really good romances novels (for example, Dark Series by Feehan or Cynsters by Laurens) from others that are only midly good.<br />Anyway, if you follow my advise, good reading! You will have a great time! :)	2003-03-16

This dictionary is great!!! My teacher told me it was high time I bought my first italian - italian dictionary (that means that the italian words you look up will be explained in italian), so I decided to buy this one.<br />It's certainly not cheap, but it is worth every penny. \\"Lo Zingarelli\\" has 1186 pages, lots of pictures (very helpful when you have not idea of what a word means), notes that help you to use it correctly and a wonderful appendix, with proverbs and the etimology of some words, among other things.<br />If you start learning a new language, you are doomed to feel uneasy with it at least for some years, until your knowledge increases well enough to make you comfortable while you use it.

Natalio Botana explains to us that the Hstory of Political Ideas is an horizon that opens before us, at the same time that keeps a legacy of ideas, previous disquisitions on the nature of power and obedience.<br /><br />In \\"La tradici'n republicana\\" (The republican tradition) Botana tries to show us the intelectual biography of Alberdi and Sarmiento, two men that played a very important role in the building of Argentina as a nation. That is the reason why he explains us the ideas of the most important influences on those two men, whose task would be to try the republican ideals in a new country that totally lacked traditions of a political kind.<br /><br />Botana mentions and studies Montesquieu, Rousseau, Adam Smith and Tocqueville, among others. That is why this book can also be used to study the history of political ideas. But I believe its deepest value lays in the fact that it delves on how difficult it was for those two men who were between exile and power, and intent on their mission to find the grounds for future legitimacy for their country, to articulate the abstract ideas they cherished with their everyday reality.<br /><br />So, the dialogue between the horizon of ideas and circumstances is the theme of this book. Even if it talks a lot about Argentina, what we learn while we read it can be applied to other situations. And, truth to be told, it is a pleasure to read a book in which the prose is so fluent and elegant. On the whole my recommendation is: read it --> you won't have regrets.PD: Sorry, but it is in Spanish!!!nish!!!	2003-02-28

I think that this book is a classic, because its historical analysis on the problems of peace after a revolutionary period is truly insightful, and contains valuable lessons that are still very important nowadays.<br /><br />Kissinger allows us to understand the difficulties inherent to finding a new legitimacy, accepted by all. He also delves into the best ways to solve the disputes that often arise in coalitions that include actors whose interests differ a lot. His comments were specifically about the Quadruple Alliance (Great Britain, Austria, Prusia and Russia) but can be applied to many other cases.<br /><br />I specially liked how he dissected the personalites of the actors in this play, Napoleon, Metternich,Castlereagh and Talleyrand, and the manner in which he highlights that those personalities influenced the course of history.<br /><br />This is an important period, because as the title of the book claims, a world was restaured. The Concert of Europe began and a new era of peace started, thanks to the perspicacy of Metternich and after the instability caused by the napoleonic wars. In this book we get to know a little more of Kissinger as an historian but also as a diplomat, as he shows us the intricacies of politics and diplomacy.<br /><br />Even if this book is sometimes a little slow, I give it my highest recommendation, because it leaves you with much more knowledge, not only about this period but also regarding political realism.<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2003-02-19

I recommend this book to everyone who wishes to understand (or at least begin to do so) the 20th century... In my opinion, that is  an imperative, because if we don't understand our past, we won't be able to see our present clearly, and we will also be deprived from a good perspective regarding our future. As Hobsbwam says, things \\"can only be understood as part of a particular historical context\\".<br /><br />In \\"The Age of Extremes\\", Hobsbawm's explains us his idea that the 20th century began in 1914 (with the outbreak of World WarI), and ended in 1991 (with the collapse of the USSR). That is the reason why he calls it \\"the short century\\". He divides that \\"short century\\" in three parts: an age of catastrophe (from 1914 to the end of World War II), a golden age (1947 - 1973) and the Landslide (1973 - 1991).<br /><br />Hobsbawm not only delves into politics, but also into economics, technology, and art, all with a profound knowledge of the subject and a caustic wit that I find irresistible. Yes, of course that there are a lot of history books regarding the 20th century. As a matter of fact, I've read many of them... But this is still my favorite, because it manages to both interesting and clear, entertaining and useful.<br /><br />Belen Alcat	2003-02-02

It can stand on its own, but I'd recommend reading it after reading the ones previously published (starting with \\"Naked in death\\"). In that way, you'll know quite a lot more about the series, and your enjoyment will be even greater.<br /><br />In \\"Purity in Death\\" (number 17 in the series)Lieutenant Eve Dallas has to find the solution for a new case in which a deadly computer virus is unleashed on child abusers. After killing its target, the virus puts on the screen a phrase: \\"Absolute purity achieved\\". Is absolute purity the aim of this group? And if so, whose standards define it? Their own? Here appears the problems of justice, but also the problem of whether those who are the worst kind of criminals deserve some kind of protection. Now, Eve, her husband Roarke,her aide Peabody, and Captain Feeny must discover the origins of the virus, and capture those who created it.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Purity in death\\" is an excellent book.

However, you must be open minded, and leave behind the fact that many consider this book \\"literature for children only\\". That was my mistake at first, when my younger sister lent them to me. I suppose I was  quite prejudiced: I didn't read them, I skimmed trough the first and decided that they weren't for me.<br />However, after seeing the first movie I realised I might be missing something worthwhile. At the second (but first serious) try, I loved them (so, what does that tell us about prejudices?). Now I've read all Harry Potter's books, and I love them (I'm anxiously waiting for the next one).<br />Anyway, I can tell that this one, \\"Harry Potter and the goblet of fire\\", was the best so far. More action and a deeper development of characters make a wonderful book. It is a little sad, though (one of the characters dies), but at the same time has a lot to teach you about what is important in life: values, friendship.<br />I would recommend this book for everybody, grown-ups (unprejudiced and with imagination, please, don't repeat my mistake) and children.

I have studied French for several years now, and I know most of the vocabulary included in this book.

The task of learning new vocabulary can be quite tedious, but this book makes it more approachable, by allowing the reader to choose what themes he is going to study, and in what order.<br /><br />I don't regret buying it, because I think it is a thoroughly useful reference book.

It is quite short (91 pages) but it is completely adecuate, compensating its lack of lenght with the respectable amount of vocabulary it contains.<br /><br />I also loved the fact that it includes a lot of different situations in which you could find yourself, were you to travel to Italy (for example reserving a hotel room, making conversation and finding public transport). One drawback, however, is that the dialogues are only in Italian (as opposed to all the vocabulary and the explanations, that are translated into English). That wasn't a very big problem to me, because my mother tongue is Spanish (which is very similar to Italian), but it could make things more difficult to you if your native language is English and you are just starting to learn Italian.<br /><br />The cassettes were a plus, and that mades a big difference between this book and \\"Conversational Italian in seven days\\" (yes, the title of that book is extremely similar to the title of this one, the only difference is that the title of that edition is \\"seven\\" instead of \\"7\\": be careful not  to buy the other by mistake!!!).<br /><br />All in all, I'd buy this book again, and that is the highest praise I can make.	2003-01-07
