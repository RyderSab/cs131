It was written to go with the recreated Miwok village behind the Yosemite Visitor Center.<br /><br />The interesting part is the text is in Miwok and English.<br /><br />The previous reviewer apparently has an ax to grind. True, in the 20th century the Miwok intermarried Piute, and Piute spouses moved into Yosemite Valley, but this booklet covers the life before the disasterous contact with European man in the mid-1800s.	2005-09-15

Frank La Pena provided the illustrations.  It's a well-written book for children or adults interested in Miwok legends.<br /><br />So many books on Native American legends, including Miwok, contain \\"fabricated\\" legends that romanticize Native Americans or otherwize bend legends to the writer's agenda (whether it's environmental, cultural, or historic).  Legends of the Yosemite Miwok is authentic and a good first book on Miwok legends.<br /><br />The other reviewer apparently has an ax to grind about surviving present-day Miwok.  The original Ahwahnees died in the early 1800s from some European disease.  Chief Tenaya's band in the mid-1800s was composed of Miwok, Paiute, and other Native peoples. Tenaya was half Miwok through his mother. From the 1900s the remaining Miwok married outside their tribe, but that's a red herring. The legends in this book told are authentic.	2005-01-27
