As a white feminist, I  am proud to be a reader of bell hooks.

While cowardly white males bet on Black prize fighters without  having the bravery or the talent to enter the ring against Black opponents  (and other people of color), who gets most of the money? The 'backers', the  arena owners, etc. This book simply does not spend enough time on the  subject. As a white woman, I side with those Black athletes who are  subverting the paradigms of sports, especially those recieved notions that  competition lends 'dignity' to the contestants. At the heart of athletics  today is racism, pure and simple, and white male heterosexist patriarchy is  to blame.	1999-05-15

I'm afraid Mr. Early does not wish to expand to any depth the problems which Black musical artists continue to face from this thorougly racist culture. To discover more pertinent investigations of this ongoing white  male-centered racism, one needs to go to the astonishingly brave and  insightful bell hooks, and other writers.

Unfortunately, he has proven to Katha Pollitt that he is  anti-women (and thus anti-minorities), and so we must regard Hitchens as an  enemy to progressive politics. However, he has a great deal of interest to  say about his birth nation, and I find it curious that his own brother is a  conservative journalist.

Williams seems to me one of those  well meaning people who unfortunately have produced a somewhat  simple-minded book, and yet it could serve as a useful corrective to  similarly simple-minded books from the conservative side of things,  especially Shelby Steele and co. Overall, this book has little to teach  anyone actively involved in changing attitudes, but it is a fair attempt  nonetheless.	1999-05-13

This is hardly the sort of book that is going to impress everyone with revelatory arguments, or even offer a new perspective upon contemporary cultural discourse, but Williams is at least occasionally lively in her  discussions of feminism. I'm afraid I don't find her disucssions of  education even the least bit compelling, and we need to turn to more  radical and inventive/transgressive voices for that. Perhaps this book  could be of use to high school students, however, in that it would promote  classroom discussions without presenting any difficulties of argument such  as that produced by more progressive thinkers. Prof. Williams is best at  short, snappy chit chat regarding race and feminism, and I'm surprised that  she has taken it upon herself to author entire books which might dilute the  field. However, as an African American who is challenging the contemporary  paradigms of race in this society, I'm pleased to discover all the help I  can get.	1999-05-13

Hitchens has a way of delineating the president's  character that are thoroughly convincing, and whatever the merit of his  other tirades, this is an interesting book; he knew the president was a  problem when it came to women, and wrote accordingly. A lot of other people  knew this about the president, but only Hitchens seems genuinely mad about  it.	1999-05-13

Of course no one should take seriously his claim that this is in  some way a 'risky' undertaking, especially from a well-paid academic.  Still, Potter knows his stuff, is capable of taking in a great variety of  the cultural discourse surrounding hip-hop and making sense of it (at least  sometimes). I suppose this is just the kind of dull-as-driftwood analysis  of a vibrant musical culture, but, as he points out, what else did you  expect from an academic?

I am not a member of the white race, nor am I male, so I am not particularly charmed by Shipler's  eurocentric paradigms. While some of us are challenging the racism of white  people on all fronts, others, who lack both courage and conviction, are  trying to find ways of blaming African-Americans for their sufferings while  the white male author tries to take credit for recognizing this.

I'm afraid that Martin Duberman has a few problems with himself, in spite of being 'good looking'and busy with a therapist. Mr. Duberman has demonstrated that he is both a challenge to heterosexist white male  ideology and yet a servant to it. There has been a curious lack of  radicalism in his writing for the Nation, and I suspect he has simply  become another academic worshipper at the Western Civ. fount of  double-talk. While some of us continue to challenge these offensive  paradigms, Duberman is more interested in retailing startlingly dull  stories about academics who are not on the cutting edge of radicalism. As a  feminist and lesbian activist, I expect more courage (and more interest!)  in a book by Duberman, who has written well in the past. Not this time;  perhaps he will finally move aside, and allow those of us who challenge the  white male agenda of hatred on all fronts  to come to the fore. I certainly  hope so.	1999-04-03

I salute Judy Chicago for combatting what these men have perpetrated upon  us as artists and as Women. She is so courageous, so forthright, never one  to shy away from speaking the truth at all times even as she questions  'truth'. Her experiences with her Black lover are also fascinating, and it  seems that now that Women and African Americans are joining to fight  patriarchal assumptions/proscriptions, we are better able to appreciate the  efforts of Judy Chicago to proclaim the relations of artistic struggle and  the struggle of civil rights.
