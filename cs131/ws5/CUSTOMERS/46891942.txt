US	46891942	R1UT7ESXB4VFG9	0131870041	269145243	Firefox and Thunderbird Garage	Books	4	21	22	N	N	Great for those new to browsers and email clients	This is an excellent volume for newcomers. <br /> <br />Unlike `Firefox Hacks' which has information for beginners, power users, programmers and web designers `F & T' is squarely and firmly a beginner's book - though it has some material useful for those who have been using the software for a short time. `F & T' provides its value by covering both the Firefox browser and the Thunderbird email client with just under two thirds of the book devoted to Firefox. <br /> <br />The book starts with a chapter devoted to the absolute beginning covering such topics as why and what is Firefox as well as installation, importing settings and bookmarks from other browsers and finding your way around the window. `F & T' then continues, explaining in a careful, step by step manner, all that a user might need to know about browsing the net with Firefox. <br /> <br />When I first noticed that `F & T' devoted almost twice as much space to Firefox as Thunderbird I feared that the Thunderbird section had been added to pad the book out without really covering the software properly. Fortunately my fears were unfounded, it is just that Thunderbird is that little bit simpler. Not being a Thunderbird user (I use Google Mail in Firefox) I fired it up and worked through the second section of the book. I discovered that `F & T' covers all the necessary information for getting the best out of Thunderbird for the average user and that little bit more that makes you feel like a power user. <br /> <br />The book finishes with four appendices that cover the shortcuts and menu commands for each program, one on hacking the preferences using about:config and editing the user.js file and a final one that covers digital certificates. <br /> <br />After reading this book and working through about half the chapters I have yet to find any egregious errors or appalling editing. Overall the style is good, though sometimes a little flippant and sometimes a little dry, it feels like there was a good strong handediting. I find the `dirty' font used in some headings a little hard to read in the sidebars. I appreciate the stylistic quirkiness and `garage' feel but it might have been better a few points larger for my aging eyes. The body type is also a little light for reading in less than ideal lighting. <br /> <br />This is not really a book for geeks. I suspect that anyone who reads Slashdot would think it too basic and too plodding. Having once again found myself supporting \\"the average user\\" I'm realising that books for users who have no real interest or expertise in computers need to be basic and step by step. `F & T' seems to me to be perfectly pitched for a book I would recommend to my mother or a friend who wanted a book to help them move away from proprietary `net tools to these open source programs. The `Garage' series seems to be growing as an alternative to that other series of books for beginners, and one that doesn't feel the need to treat users as dummies. While the `Garage' series are definitely pitched at the beginner, they assume a decent level of intelligence and some ability to explore on your own. <br /> <br />If you would  like a closer look at the book then you can visit the Prentice Hall site for the book for the table of contents, preface, foreword and two example chapters. Like all Prentice Hall book pages all of these apart from the table of contents are PDF files. <br /> <br />I currently work on a large campus supporting Macintosh users where I find the most common browser unstable and lacking in features and the most common email client just a little buggy and lacking in good support (neither are the free products provided by Apple). I think that a quick install and a copy of this book would solve a number of my problems. I would recommend this volume to all those who want a good beginner to mid level user volume on two excellent pieces of software. I would prefer to recommend this book to a beginner than any other on the topic I have seen as itdoesn't attempt to cover too much of the learning curve, rather it goes for width, covering both pieces of software and more of each that might be of interest to the early user.	2005-05-06
US	46891942	RIWUPSNCQ8L7C	0596007760	617646654	iPod Fan Book	Books	3	2	3	N	N	A little more style than substance in this good book	The first impression you get of O'Reillys iPod Fan Book is of the packaging. A small volume (about the same height as the iPod and twice the width) it comes with a half-height wrap that has the title and author on the front and the bar code, price and a short contents on the back. Take this off and you have a full-size cover with all the simple elegance of the white iPod itself. The front features the wheel of a 4G iPod and the back has just the Apple logo and \\"iPod\\" in Apple's distinctive typeface below it. Remove this second cover and you have a book with a simple design of grey with a white border, the back is blank and the front has the title and the subtitle \\"Go everywhere with iPod\\" in small type. <br /> <br /> This concentration on design flows through the rest of the book. It is visually stunning; at the same time, effort has been made to make the design useful. The pages are visually tabbed to make it easy to navigate the seven chapters. Each chapter is tabbed in a different color reflected through use of that color within the chapter. Full color pictures and screen dumps add to the legibility and usability of the book. <br /> <br />This book is also full of useful information for the newcomer to the iPod. A small amount is covered in the documentation you get with the iPod, but a great deal is not. Apart from a useful chapter on accessories, the book focuses on methods of getting the best from an iPod and how to organise your music. <br /> <br /> To sum up this book: it is a little more style than substance and falls short of being the ideal book for all newcomers to the iPod (and even less for experienced users). On the other hand, the style makes the information that is provided readily accessible for all. I'd say this is the perfect companion to an iPod for a teen-age girl and if my 12-year-old daughter was getting the mini she has been hinting for, a copy of this would be included. (I expect that anyone who spent more than ten minutes deciding on the colour of their mini would probably love the elegance and style of this thin volume.) The low price makes it a great impulse buy or stocking stuffer.	2005-03-07
US	46891942	RIZFY2ZLQGDEX	0131471481	860865218	Web Search Garage	Books	5	17	18	N	N	More about searching the web from a good author	As someone who lives on the wrong side of the world from the best sources of information and shopping I seem to spend a large amount of time online, and a large part of that in a search engine. Web Search Garage promises to let me `Find it faster with less junk, less hassle.' <br /> <br />For experienced net researchers and the search-engine savvy among us, the book may well not live up to the promise, though for a large number of `net users out there it may be just the thing. Where Calishain's previous book, Google Hacks, covered one search engine in great depth in a fairly technical way, this book covers the entire topic of web research in a more friendly manner and language, leaving out the more technical topics of APIs and programming interfaces to spend more time covering advanced search syntaxes and off-the-beaten path search engines and directories. <br /> <br />Calishain has for quite a while written well-researched, informative articles on search engines and research for her weekly newsletter and website ResearchBuzz and the time she has spent on the topic and writing experience have informed this volume. She starts out with the absolute basics, the difference between a search engine (Google) and a searchable subject index (Yahoo) before going on to cover how to get the best out of each. <br /> <br />The book also covers a wide range of search related topics such as finding jobs, local information, multimedia or information about people and Genealogy. Almanacs, dictionaries and encyclopedia get covered. It's hard to think of something missing. Calishain has also taken a great deal of care with her topics. In the section on searching for drugs and medical information, for example, she stresses checking the reliability of your sources. <br /> <br />If you visit Calishain's site for the book at Web Search Garage (which redirects to the book's page at her ResearchBuzz site) there is a link to the table of contents and an example chapter. She also has two `freebie' articles, `Four Things Yahoo Can Do that Google Can't' and `Seven Ways to Save Time Searching' that are further good examples of her writing and the usefulness of the content. She also has an offer for a free six-month subscription to ResearchBuzzExtra, her paid extension to ResearchBuzz. <br /> <br />This volume has gone for breadth instead of depth. That, and the low starting point should make it an ideal beginners book. Since I had on hand my daughter Jessica (a slightly tech-savvy twelve-year-old with a brand-new broadband connection), I lent her my copy of the book. The response: <br /> <br />    \\"This book is absolutely fantastic and I love it to death! I loved how Tara writes about Google and Yahoo and also about smaller search engines. By reading this book you find out how to find the exact information that you want. Also there are many websites in this book that are very helpful. To make the most of them I wrote them down then later checked them out on the internet. There are heaps of helpful sites for kids and heaps for all ages. Sites for fun and sites for information. I love that it is written as if Tara is talking to you and you are just reading instead of listening. It's a really cool book but if you are going to read it you need to know a little about searching the internet first. A really great book.\\" <br /> <br />Jessica is correct about the language. Tara has written in a light, conversational style that lends itself to quick reading. At the same time either the writing or the editing has been quite tight, the information is packed in. This is a book that needs, indeed deserves, a second read. <br /> <br />The perfect book for the average web user who wants to improve his research skills. I'd put this one in the Christmas stocking for all those people who are getting a new computer or a new broadband connection. That's not to say that the more technical savvy will find nothing in this book, so if you give a copy to someone, either read it firstor borrow it back -- you may find it worth enough to get your own copy.	2004-11-26

Now that O'Reilly's AppleScript In A Nutshell is showing its age (and wasn't that great in the first place), and Danny Goodman's book is even older, I was pleased to hear that this volume had come along. <br /> <br />Teach Yourself Applescript in 24 Hours (TYA) from Sams Publishing is more up to date: it covers Applescript under OS X and the use of AppleScript Studio to build GUI applications using the language. That's its strength. The book's first weakness, though, is that it starts too far down the learning curve in my opinion. The first few chapters of TYA could be read by someone almost totally new to the Macintosh -- they cover such basics as running the scripts installed with the OS and getting new scripts from Apple and installing them. At the same time, they introduce basic AppleScript programming terminology not really required for these sorts of tasks such as suites, classes and commands. This material would have best waited a few chapters. It is not really until 'Hour 6', most of the way through the first part of the book, that it really sorts itself out and gets down to really teaching you AppleScript. <br /> <br />The Basics <br /> <br />The book is divided into four parts: 'Getting Started With AppleScript,' which covers using scripts and basic programming concepts; 'Writing Scripts With Script Editor,' which takes you through using the Script Editor, details AppleScript syntax and how to script the Finder and various applications and using AppleScript Dictionaries; 'Working With AppleScript Studio,' which covers building AppleScript-based GUI applications using Project Builder and Interface Builder all the way through to complex applications that can store and retrieve documents; and a final section 'Advanced Scripting,' which covers Script Objects, scripting across a network (including SOAP and XML-RPC), and integrating scripts with the terminal and cron. <br /> <br />Each section is then divided up into chapters designed to be worked through in less than an hour ,with a small number of short exercises at the end. I found that most chapters took me about half an hour before I reached the exercises, which then took ten to fifteen minutes. <br /> <br />As you can see, almost everything you could ask for is touched on in this book. Once over the introductory chapters, I found the book to be well laid out, well structured and well written. I particularly liked Part III on AppleScript Studio; it started easily and worked up to quite an advanced little application explaining everything well along the way. <br /> <br />The Bad <br /> <br />There are some things missing, however. Debugging is hardly mentioned (3/4 of one lesson), and debugging is not exactly trivial in AppleScript. I also found no mention of my pet demon with AppleScript; its incredibly strong typing and problems with having data in the wrong type; this is a classic problem with files and file names. In reality, this book teaches you the language without really getting down to teach you how to program in the language. A fine distinction, I know, but after just reading Learning Perl Objects, References & Modules, I found TYA to be light on real examples and real world code. Even the best section, the one on AppleScript Studio, didn't touch on many things you will need to know. <br /> <br />Sams have a page devoted to the book at the Sams web site. It has the table of contents and a sample chapter and some of the code from the book. The sample chapter is the third chapter 'Running The Scripts You Already Have' and really doesn't give you a good feel for how the book teaches you AppleScript programming. The page to download the code examples says \\"All the code developed for the book in one convenient download,\\" but in fact all you get are the AppleScript Studio projects and source from four of the chapters. Oh, and the introduction says \\"There are even a few goodies on the web site that aren't in the book\\" -- they sure must be good as I couldn't find them. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I think this book starts too far down the learning curve and leaves off too early, with not enough detail. It seems a shame, what we have here is well laid out and well written, I wanted it to be better after I had finished. This book might suit someone absolutely new to the Mac who wanted to learn enough AppleScript to perform a few basic operations, for everyone else it'll be better to go for AppleScript 1-2-3 will from Peachpit or AppleScript: The Definitive Guide from O'Reilly.	2004-08-16
US	46891942	R25JN4U0ZLR7R6	1590591135	528233825	Learn How to Program Using Any Web Browser	Books	2	13	15	N	N	Doesn't quite hit the spot	Harold Davis has started with a marvelous idea, teaching programming using a language available on all platforms, JavaScript, and an interface familiar to everyone, the web browser. Learn How to Program Using Any Web Browser is written for absolute beginners to learn the basic principles of programming -- or at least that's what the cover would have you believe. <br /> <br />The language is suitably light and simple, the book well-structured and broken down into easily digested chunks. The order in which concepts are introduced is fairly traditional for a language tutorial: first we get types, variables and statements, before moving on to conditionals, loops, and functions, followed by arrays and objects before finishing with event-driven programming. Davis' decision to leave string handling till last seems a little perverse and personally I would have introduced functions earlier. <br /> <br />My real complaints about this book centre on the abstract nature of the discussion. There are very few real world examples that could be useful to anyone. The best you get is a version of \\"Rock, Paper, Scissors\\" in Chapter 3, and an 'auction' application. The book would have been improved dramatically if the end result of your study was a few things you could actually point to. <br /> <br />I also have a complaint about the target audience for this book. The web page for the book at the publishers states that \\"The target reader is likely a twelve- or thirteen-year-old, who is just starting to get curious about what makes a computer work -- or an office worker who has been using computer applications for years, and would like to spend some time delving deeper into what makes them tick.\\" Most adults and even teenagers don't want to 'learn how to program' as much as they want to learn how to use a tool to perform a task. If your tool is JavaScript, then it's almost certain your task is related to building web pages, but this gets little real attention from Davis. For even younger students, this book totally lacks anything to hold their attention -- the lack of real-world examples hurts here. <br /> <br />I also take issue with the title: this book doesn't really teach 'programming' much at all. It certainly teaches you to write JavaScript, but where are the sections about the real lessons of programming, such as top-down vs. bottom-up design, or breaking a task up into chunks? Even debugging has little coverage -- a single thirty-page chapter, half of which is specific to JavaScript or the throwing and handling of exceptions. Since the work of Papert and others at MIT twenty-five years ago, we've learned a great deal about how to teach programming concepts in a simple manner, but Davis appears to have ignored all this and given us a language tutorial. The publisher's web page for the book says \\"very emphatically, this is not a book about programming JavaScript.\\" If that's so then I'd argue that it isn't a book about learning the principles of programming either. <br /> <br />It is obvious from this book that Davis is an excellent writer; if he had tried to write a book to teach JavaScript and had focused on the tasks for which it is often used this, volume may have been superb. As it is, he has shot for a higher goal and fallen far too short. <br /> <br />If you would like to check it out for yourself, you can go to the web page for the book where there is sample chapter, the Table of Contents (though they call it a \\"Detailed TOC\\" as distinct from the 'Table of Contents,' which is just a list of 11 chapter titles) and index, all in PDF format. <br /> <br />I went looking for a book that I could give to my 11-year-old daughter now that she has become interested in \\"what Daddy does.\\" I'm still looking, I'm certain that this one isn't it.	2004-08-16
US	46891942	R1RSW930AB9324	0596005571	164597940	AppleScript: The Definitive Guide (Definitive Guides)	Books	4	20	23	N	N	Good book on AppleScript for all	It is refreshing to find a book that is totally honest about the drawbacks of the language it hopes to teach. AppleScript: the Definitive Guide is one such volume. Matt Neuburg delves into all the flaws inherent in this language. <br /> <br />AppleScript as a language and development environment has some terrible problems, and I applaud Neuburg for not trying to hide them away. Personally I love the power the language can provide, while loathing it for it's \\"English-like\\" syntax and the problems inherent in having most of the language defined in differing ways in different applications. <br /> <br />One of Applescript's problems is that it is difficult to teach, as you almost have to understand everything before you can know anything. Unfortunately that problem is reflected in this book. Neuburg constantly finds himself having to resort to the \\"believe me for now, I'll explain later\\" strategy throughout the book. <br /> <br />The book is broken up into four sections: \\"AppleScript Overview,\\" \\"The AppleScript Language,\\" \\"AppleScript In Action,\\" and several appendices. <br /> <br />\\"AppleScript Overview\\" is a well written look at what AppleScript is, what it is good for and how to use it. Chapter 3, \\"The AppleScript Experience\\" is an impressive warts-and-all walk-through of the author developing an AppleScript to solve the problem of renaming files to conform to a particular standard using FrameMaker and the Finder. It is here that the reader will first see the problems inherent with AppleScript as Neuburg battles with incomprehensible dictionaries, unknown object models and uncommunicative error messages to build his script. <br /> <br />Part II, \\"The Applescript Language,\\" is the 200-page core of this book. Neuburg provides a detailed and comprehensive look at every detail of AppleScript's syntax and semantics. The first chapter of this section, \\"Introducing AppleScript\\" contains a marvelous section entitled 'The \\"English-likeness\\" Monster' that is a short, sharp (and entirely justified) attack on the problem of AppleScript's attempt to be English-like in syntax. <br /> <br />In the rest of this section Neuburg provides an exceptional survey of the language. I personally appreciated his examination of the intricacies of type coercion and the exotic scoping rules. He has also taken the time to write and elaborate a large number of small pieces of code to demonstrate gotchas and tricks throughout the language. <br /> <br />It is this section that truly separates this book from every other AppleScript book I have previously read -- it is a masterful guide to the language. <br /> <br />Part III is a concrete path towards writing your own scripts. Neuburg starts by examining application dictionaries in depth. The real power of AppleScript lies not in the language itself but in the ability to use language extensions built in to other applications. This also becomes a huge flaw when the only documentation you get is in the application dictionary. As Neuburg puts it \\"One purpose of the dictionary is to show the human user how to speak AppleScript to a scriptable application in order to drive that application. But a dictionary, by its very nature, is not completely adequate to this task.\\" He then goes on to explain the flaws. <br /> <br />The first appendix is a dump of the AppleScript Suite from AppleScript's 'aeut' resource. This is the core of the language usable everywhere. The second Appendix is a good, useful guide to tools and resources for the AppleScript programmer. <br /> <br />Taken as whole, this is a great book for the AppleScript programmer, both beginner and expert. It has a good writing style, has been well edited and well constructed. Neuburg may be putting in too many forward references, though. Other reviewers, particularly those newer to AppleScript, have called the book frustrating and confusing. I think this may be due to both the high information density in this book and Neuburg's fast introduction to topics thatare better explained later in the book. If you are a newcomer to programming and AppleScript then this may be daunting. <br /> <br />If you are new, however, this is still an excellent volume but you may have to force yourself to finish it and then go over at least Part I and II again to truly understand the language. It would probably be a good idea to start trying to build your own scripts after the first read through. I must say, that after taking a good hard look at the way the book has been constructed and ordered I couldn't really come up with a better way that wouldn't have doubled the size of the book. <br /> <br />Visit the O'Reilly web page for the book if you would like to see the Table of Contents or grab an example chapter. <br /> <br />Neuburg has said \\"My approach is not to rely on documentation, ... but to bang away at the language itself, testing and experimenting, trying to deduce the underlying rules\\" and this approach has certainly borne fruit in this volume. For all it's minor flaws you cannot say, as may be true of many other tech books, that it is a rewrite of the documentation. He has approached the problem from a different direction and given us a book that offers an excellent guide to the language. <br /> <br />I would recommend it to all Macintosh owners as the perfect way to unleash another powerful aspect of your system. For people who have no AppleScript or programming experience who want to be totally spoon fed this book is probably only a 5/10, for people with a little AppleScript experience, a fair amount of programming experience and a willingness to stick through to the end this book is probably a 9/10. It is certainly the best book on AppleScript I have seen.	2004-08-16

I first came across his writing with his article, \\"A Plan For Spam,\\" on using Bayesian filtering to block spam and found it a well written and informative technical article. I next came across him some time later when he wrote an essay on his web site entitled \\"Hackers & Painters,\\" and once again it was well written, informative and (more importantly for an essayist) thought provoking. I was excited to hear he had published a volume of writing and pleased with the copy I received. <br /> <br />Literature has a long history of the essayist; since those famous theses on the church door at Wittenberg a well written and thought provoking essay on a topic has provided power and focus for important discussions. Graham has either learnt or discovered the important points in writing a good essay; brevity, quality writing and thought. <br /> <br />In this volume Graham covers a range of topics, though all are, understandably, centered on computers. Why nerds are unpopular at school, and what this demonstrates about our eduction system; why program in Lisp; the importance of \\"startups\\", programming languages and web development are all touched on. At the same time he covers topics less techno-centric such as heretical thinking and speech. wealth creation and unequal income distribution. <br /> <br />I found myself disagreeing with him often while reading the book, though every time I did I found his argument compelling. I agree with Andy Hertzfeld, quoted on the back cover of the book, \\"He may even make you want to start programming in Lisp.\\" Graham is politically more conservative and right wing than me, he is also a fervent supporter of Lisp, while I'm a C and Perl advocate. It is telling that at no time did I find myself railing at his views, rather I was reading his arguments and giving them meme space. A good sign of a writer that does notindulge in unnecessary or extreme polemic. <br /> <br />Graham also tends to concentrate on a single point in each essay, allowing for both good coverage and a brief essay. Where he covers a larger context, such as high school education in \\"Why Nerds Are Unpopular\\" that opens the book, he seems to focus on just one or two good points of discussion. <br /> <br />The title essay is the second in the collection and provides an interesting look at hacking and some lessons we can learn by analogy to the work and life of Rennaissance painters, particularly in how it is done and how it can be funded. The third, \\"What You Can't Say\\" is social commentary on heretical thinking. Four, \\"Good Bad Attitude\\" is on the benefits of breaking rules, both in life and hacking. Five, \\"The Other Road Ahead\\", is an excellent look at web based software and why it offers benefits to both user and developer with Graham examining some lessons he learnt while building ViaWeb. Six, \\"How To Make Wealth\\", is a look at becoming wealthy and how a 'startup' might be the best way to do it. The seventh, \\"Mind The Gap\\", is an argument that we should not worry so much about 'unequal wealth distribution' and why it might actually be a good thing. From this list, and a look at the table of contents (available as a PDF on the O'Reilly page for the book), you can see that Graham covers a wide spectrum while never straying from topics he knows. <br /> <br />If I was forced to identify a weakness in this book it may well be that Graham does not evince doubt or uncertainty in his arguments, on a few occasions he may admit to a narrow view or knowledge but doubt or uncertainty don't seem to enter his field of vision while he writes. This coupled with a single viewpoint makes the book less than all-encompassing in discussion. However, I must admit that it is almost impossible to be anything more with a single author and Graham may well be more honest than others who pick and choose the alternatives they present.<br /> <br />Most of the essays are available at Graham's website, but frankly I am a fan of dead trees and appreciated that this book could be read on the bus or in bed. If you would prefer something you can read on the bus then a PDF of the second chapter, \\"Hackers & Painters\\" is available from the O'Reilly page. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to think about a number of topics important to the culture of our tiny corner of the world, computers and the net, while not ignoring the rest.	2004-08-09

This caused a fair amount of teeth gnashing when I discovered it had gone the way of all flesh in OS X Panther to be replaced with Postfix. <br /> <br />Fortunately, my first needs were simple and I came to realise that Postfix was a much easier system to install and maintain. Now that my needs are more complex, I was glad when this book hit my desk at exactly the same time as I started upgrading the corporate servers from Mac OS 9 to OS X Server. <br /> <br />Postfix: The Definitive Guide seems to fit the bill. It is a well-written and well-constructed guide to mail systems in general and Postfix in particular. <br /> <br />The book starts with a good overview of the underlying technology in Chapters 1 and 2. I can't blame Dent for my slight confusion in the section on addresses and headers - having RFC822 superseded by RFC2822 was just a little too much coincidence for this particular \\"bear of little brain.\\" He then follows it with a chapter discussing Postfix's architecture, important since Postfix uses a much more modular approach than the sendmail monolith, with each part of the mail handling process a different executable and the single queue turned into five. <br /> <br />Once the background is well covered, Dent then gets onto the nitty-gritty of configuring and administering Postfix. He has certainly covered everything I needed, including spam handling, multiple domains, relaying, SASL authentication and using LDAP. Once I'd finished grokking all that, and getting it integrated into my servers, I had a corporate email system up in three sites that replaced and improved upon a couple of thousand dollars worth of proprietary dreck. Happy is an understatement. <br /> <br />Dent's writing is sometimes a little patchy, though never bad. The technical detail does seemoverpowering in places, though, and I occasionally found myself reading a section through more than once with a configuration file open in front of me. There are certainly spots where a little more hand holding and care with the writing would have been appreciated. (If you are a little more cognizant of the interstices of mail systems then you may not have the same problem.) <br /> <br />I did, however, appreciate the appendices enormously. The four appendices cover configuration parameters, Postfix commands, installation, and an FAQ. My system came with Postfix compiled and installed just as I required it so I didn't get a chance to thoroughly test out Dent's installation procedure (though it looks good); the other three continue to be useful. <br /> <br />If you want to have a look for yourself, then the usual O'Reilly page is complete with a table of contents and index, but this time no example chapter is provided (how come, O'Reilly?). You can also get an expanded version of the FAQ in Appendix 4 from Dent's website. A better example of Dent's writing style is an excellent article on troubleshooting with Postfix logs at O'Reilly's Onlamp.com. <br /> <br />This is a good book, Dent has explained the underlying methodology and use of Postfix well, taken the reader through all aspects of this MTA system and explained both the why and the how. I would recommend this book (and, as a result Postfix) to anyone looking for an MTA and a guide to configuring and running it.	2004-08-09

The first two chapters are introductory material, though the authors quickly introduce some code with JavaScript routines to talk to both Google and Amazon. The second of them does a good job explaining the intricacies of DOM and how you use it to build a web page in Java. Then the authors get down to some serious work at using Java, including stand-alone applications and applets, to access web services.    They move fast throughout the book; this is not one to read quickly or without ready access to a computer. That said, the writing is good; the text is understandable and all the code is well explained.    The book covers a wide gamut of techniques and technologies, including SOAP and REST on the query side, and XSLT and XPath on the output side.    Then the book moves on to instructions for offering your own services. This part of the book starts off with WebDAV using Tomcat, though there is a short digression into Java Server Pages before really getting down to the nitty gritty. Finally the book shows how to use WSDL and Axis to easily create full web applications.    You can see that this volume covers a lot of territory. This breadth may well be the book's largest flaw; its wide reach means no topic gets a really deep coverage and a number of topics do not get the coverage they deserve. Indeed I would have to say that only a much better Java programmer than I would get full value from this volume -- there were parts where the authors lost me entirely and it took an effort to get back my understanding, occasionally resorting to a Java manual.    The publishers have a page for the book that has an example chapter, table of contents, index and source code. The example chapter, 4, details how to build a SOAP server using Java and provides an excellent example for the book. Ifyou're a little unsure of your Java skills, take a look at this chapter and see if you can easily understand the code and explanation. If you can, then this volume should have no surprises for you.    It should be said that nothing about the book's cover tells you how much of it relies on Java, though a good read of the table of contents makes it obvious. I would have personally preferred a book that was more general in the programming language it used, covering more of the tactics and methods rather than examining specific code. If, on the other hand, you are an experienced Java programmer looking for a book on programming web services in that language, then this is an excellent volume.	2004-08-09

There is one small part of my childhood that is constantly returning; every few years it breaks out and I find my apartment covered in small pieces of brightly coloured plastic: Yes, the Lego addiction strikes. One of those recent episodes involved a train set (perhaps I indulged in a few pieces of track and an extra car or two - but that's all, I swear. <br /> <br />Getting Started with Lego Trains is a fairly good guide to designing and building Lego trains. The writing is a clear, simple style that should be understood by anyone, the layout is clear. <br /> <br />Jacob McKee, the author, is webmaster at Bricks On The Brain, a good site which acts as a portal to build instructions. He also has a section devoted to the book which has three example pages and some links to other sites useful to Lego train builders. Both the book and the site itself promise at least a couple of articles by McKee but these are still \\"to come.\\" I hope they come soon as McKee promises (in the book and on the site) an article on using decals and I'd like to know his sources and methods. <br /> <br />The book starts with two chapters that are absolutely basic; most of the information here is included in the Lego documentation you get with the train kits, such as how to hook up the electrical power and the different train and carriage sets available. There are still some useful nuggets such as the 'Studs Not On Top' technique for getting bricks pointing away from the vertical and interesting trivia such as a short history of Lego trains. McKee also adds some details that may be hard to glean from the Lego manuals such as how an active passing line can cause a short circuit in your track. <br /> <br />The third chapter is only two pages, which once again detail some fairly obvious information such as the various parts of the train couplings and bogies. From that point on, the book gets interesting. The real core of the book consists of the three chapters that McKee has devoted to three different train models. Instead of just giving you the plans to build the locomotive and two carriages, McKee has shared the design process itself and gives some useful design and building tips before showing you the instructions. <br /> <br />The first model is a glorious model of a GP-38 locomotive (if you want to see the finished models then you can get decent-sized pictures on McKee's site). It might have been better to have had this model last of the three, as it is the most complex and I found it the hardest to make with my Lego collection - there are more specialized parts in this model and I had to change the design in a couple of spots. Given the great look of the finished model, this isn't too much of a complaint. <br /> <br />The second example is a refrigerated car (or \\"reefer car\\" in train yard slang). I found that I couldn't build this car in the all-green of the book design but had the parts to build it in red. Since, as McKee points out, these sorts of cars are to be found in dozens of different paint jobs I don't feel this was a problem. There are considerably fewer specialized parts in this model. <br /> <br />The third example is a container car (with containers), which is the easiest to build and uses few specialized pieces you are unlikely to have if you own a train set already. Once again my only real problem was one of having exactly the same colour as the book -- one of my containers has red doors instead of white, for example. <br /> <br />I hope from my descriptions of the chapter you can see why I think the model order is wrong -- I'd completely reverse the order of these three chapters. <br /> <br />For an early teen (or older) reader, the strength of this book is the tips and encouragement McKee gives in these three chapters for designing your own locomotives and carriages. There are dozens of little tips and tricks on creating a visually pleasing and playable model design. Younger readers may not appreciate McKee's excellent advice on creating your own designs as much as older readers, but they will enjoy building the models all the same. <br /> <br />There is a final chapter on building track layouts, including some useful tips on building track inclines, and finally two short appendices, one on where to buy Lego and a glossary (McKee labels it \\"terminology\\"). <br /> <br />Originally (before publication, that is), this book was advertised at $24.95. The actual cover price is $19.95, though, and No Starch have dropped the price again. At the new list of $14.95, it becomes much more attractive and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in designing and building their own Lego train locomotives and carriages. The readable, simple style and clear build instructions make it enjoyable for quite young readers and older, more dedicated builders will appreciate the design tips. Lego have train sets that they advise are for 8 years old or older, and I believe the average seven-year-old would have no problem understanding the build instructions in this book.	2004-08-07

I kept it running with the assistance of a marvelous volume purchased at a specialist bookstore that was referred to as \\"the shop manual.\\" It wasn't much help teaching you how to drive or how to park but if you needed to know how to perform an oil change, flush the radiator or bleed the brakes it told you all the details. Now James Duncan Davidson has given me a shop manual for Macintosh OS X Panther. <br /> <br />This volume assumes you know how to use your Mac, how to perform all the routine changes that are easily accomplished with the GUI. Davidson also assumes you don't want to know how to get a movie running as your desktop, or get an Expos blob floating on the screen or any of the usual sort of 'hacks' or 'hints.' What he gives is a good guide to lifting the hood and performing serious mechanical work or tweaking the performance of your Mac with enough background information so that you can feel confident taking your own steps. <br /> <br />It was good after a few near misses to read an O'Reilly book that was once again well written, well edited, tight and crammed full of information pitched at just the right level. Davidson has done an excellent job with this book. <br /> <br />Davidson starts with a little history, and from the viewpoint he presents, this is not a waste of space; he spends his time explaining exactly how we arrived at the current version of the Mac OS. <br /> <br />Then we have a chapter titled \\"Lay of the Land\\" that explores the file system, including both the Finder view and the view you get from the command line. It also explains the four file system domains and the 'Library' directory. The third chapter is a quick (20 pages) look at the Terminal and shell. <br /> <br />Then we get 'Part II: Essentials,' which is the 120-page core of the book. This starts off, logically, with system startup and the login (and log out and shutdown). This is followed by short chapters on users and groups, files and permissions, monitoring, scheduling and preferences and defaults before a marvelous long chapter on the file system. Davidson goes into great detail and closely covers each of the topics, making sure that you get all the details not just 'recipes.' <br /> <br />Part III (\\"Advanced Topics\\") starts with a chapter on Open Directory that I found particularly useful. It includes coverage on Kerberos and single sign-on that explains it well, as well as the command-line Open Directory tools. The chapter on printing could have had a bit more guts. It covers the obvious but leaves out such joys as CUPS apart from a half-page sidebar; since sharing printers has caused me more than a little grief I would have appreciated more detail here. The final chapter on networking is better, and provides more useful detail. <br /> <br />It must be said that this section concentrates more on user level detail and leaves out real information on server level software and options. Given the target group for this book, and that a book has to draw a line somewhere, this is quite fair. <br /> <br />Davidson has picked his topics well, almost everyone will find all of Part II useful and educational. Part III is perfect for people wanting to run Panther in a corporate environment. He has balanced the command line and GUI well, pointing out where you can do a job with both and explaining the details. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to any Panther user with a moderate amount of experience. It is not for the newcomer to the Mac, perhaps, but everyone else will benefit from this book.	2004-08-07

Managing Linux Systems with Webmin, written by Webmin's author Jamie Cameron, is an extensive look at using and extending it, a good guide not without flaws.<br />The book is structured as 60 chapters, without any division into sections and I have serious arguments with the order of chapters; why are the chapters about configuring Webmin at the end, for example. That said, the book has a fine index and the usual two-level contents make it a fraction easier to find what you want.<br />I do, however, have a little digression about the `Bruce Peren's Open Source Series,' of which this book is a member. Frankly, I think they all need, and deserve, a much stronger hand in editing. With this volume it is the bad structure and order; with \\"Intrusion Detection Systems with Snort\\" I found myself engrossed by the information and furious at the appalling grammar and sentence construction, particularly in the introductory chapters. The others in the series look significantly better at first glance but could still use better editing.<br />Once again we have an author or publisher who throws Linux into the title to make sure that it gets found by the greatest mass of likely readers while the tool described is more (not that I criticise the practice, they want to sell books.) Any *nix system can be controlled using Webmin -- including a great deal of Mac OS X not available through `System Preferences.' Indeed, I'd recommend the tool to all OS X users who want to gain better control and install better tools for the underlying BSD layer in OS X. I use it myself for just this reason. If you run any other *nix system don't be put off by the `Linux' in the title: very little of this book is Linux specific.<br />This one is well written -- Cameron has a light, informative style that I look for in a tech book. The book is well laid out, he gives good examples, good explanations and screen shots.<br />Cameron starts out with three introductory chapters on Webmin, its installation and security before launching into forty three chapters on using various Webmin modules, but with no real pattern to the order of most of the chapters. Why, for example, is the NFS module at chapter 4 while the Samba module is discussed in 43? I could list another half dozen examples without raising a sweat.<br />There is then a chapter on Usermin, the Webmin system for ordinary users. This is followed by three chapters on the server clustering system, a few on Webmin configuration and logging before the volume ends with chapters on building modules and themes.<br />Some of the chapters on the modules within Webmin border on merely stating the obvious, others are extremely useful. Overall they constitute a good manual to using the system, Webmin users who have not spent a great deal of time administering servers will find them particularly useful. The chapters on clustering, using Webmin on multiple servers to perform the same task at the once on many machines, are a good guide to administering and using this useful facility. I found the chapters on writing your own module more than adequate, I'm well under way to writing my first one after only a short time with the system and book.<br />One final complaint. Where in this book does it tell you how to start Webmin? I didn't want Webmin running from boot, so I answered No to that question and Webmin then ran. Nowhere did it tell me how to restart Webmin after I rebooted my computer and having the script `start' in the directory specified as the config directory is a little less than intuitive.<br />In conclusion, this is a good book. With a little work on the structure it would be an excellent book, rising from a rating of six to an eight or nine. the lack of structure makes it unduly hard to find what you are after. I would recommend Webmin, as a tool, to almost everyone running a supported server. If you have no need for the sectionon clustering and writing your own modules you could buy The Book of Webmin for a few dollars less or browse the same book (even download a PDF version free) at Swelltech, which is less comprehensive but much better structured (and tells you how to restart Webmin). If you want a guide to Webmin that includes notes on writing your own module then this will do until something better comes along, or they release a second edition with greater thought to structure and order.	2004-04-06

Once again a `Missing Manual' has come to my help. `iMovie 3 &amp; iDVD: The Missing Manual'  is an excellent book.<br />I previously reviewed iPhoto2: The Missing Manual and said \\"The target audience for this book would probably be a little less technical than myself, however when I find myself in a field I don't understand well I don't mind a little stuff for the absolute newbie\\" -- and once again this is true. iMovie 3 &amp; iDVD: The Missing Manual finds me in an area where I am technically inferior. Once again I truly appreciated this book and its style.<br />The book is broken up into four sections, one devoted to video cameras and shooting a movie, a large one on editing in iMovie 3, and smaller sections on exporting out of iMovie 3 and on using iDVD. At the end are two useful appendices: the first is a menu-by-menu look at iMovie 3, and the second is an iMovie 3 troubleshooting guide. The latter is often needed and always useful -- iMovie 3 still has more than one bug.<br />The first section gives a great deal of incredibly useful information about video cameras and how to use them, including hints on various types of shooting such as sporting events, interviews and weddings. The technical information on cameras is perfect if you have yet to buy a camera, including a guide to which features are essential and which unnecessary as you can do the same thing (only better) in iMovie 3. When it goes on to the `how to shoot' section, you get pretty much the same advice you'll get anywhere, but since we didn't really read all of from the last book on video we read (and forgot half the bits we did read) it's nice to have it there again.<br />The second section does a good job of explaining the details of iMovie 3, even down to some of itsshortcomings and bugs. I also appreciated the way it spent as much time on improving the quality of the finished film as it did telling me how to use the various parts of the software. It follows a logical sequence through the movie-making process, giving good details on how iMovie does the job, how to get the best result and what sort of things to avoid -- particularly useful for things like transitions and effects when less is best.<br />The third section, titled \\"Finding Your Audience,\\" is a bit more of a problem. It really has nothing to do with finding an audience and a lot more to do with QuickTime. The section first spends ten pages telling us how to get our edited film back onto the camcorder or onto a VCR, then it spends a lot of time dealing with exporting to QuickTime, including posting movies to the web and some info on using the QuickTime player, including some \\"tricks\\" with QuickTime Player Pro.<br />The attention to the finished product in the second section carries through to the fourth section on iDVD, though the writing here is not quite as good. It is incredibly informative, however. I learned a great deal about putting together all sorts of iDVD projects, including ways of customizing almost every aspect of the finished product.<br />O'Reilly have the usual marketing stuff on their website while Pogue Press have the handy little Missing CD  section with links to all the free and shareware software mentioned in the book. Neither has a sample chapter or the table of contents.<br />One of the drawbacks of getting free software is that we don't get good free documentation. One of the benefits of free software is that we can choose which `documentation' to buy. Some people might prefer the style of the `Dummies' books, others the style of Peachpit's Visual Quickstart Guide. I've had a look at all three and like the balance of depth and explanation that Pogue has in his `Missing Manual' series. I once again find myself recommending a `Missing Manual'to everyone. While catering to the beginner, this book goes deep enough that all but the most long-term user of these two pieces of software will find something to learn in this volume.	2004-04-06

With the advent of personal operating systems with file sharing, remote login and built-in web servers, and the spread of broadband networks with their always-on connectivity, it should now be a concern for everyone.<br />It really didn't concern me until one day when I was checking the logs on my Mac OS X box while developing a web app and discovered dozens of entries from all over the globe probing my box to see if it was an insecure IIS server. I then decided I needed to pay attention to security alerts and the help of a book like Macintosh OS X Maximum Security to help me understand and fix any holes.<br />The Good<br />The book is divided into four sections. Part 1 is about learning to think about security, covering such topics as physical security and protection from your users and bad guys. Part II, `Vulnerabilities and Exposures,' covers the various sorts of attack such as password attacks, trojans and worms, sniffers and spoofing. Part III, `Specific Mac OS X Resources and How To Secure Them,' covers just that, the various servers such as FTP, mail, Apache and SSH and how to go about making them safe. The final part covers attack prevention, detection, reaction and recovery with topics such as firewalls, alarm systems, logs and disaster planning.<br />Macintosh OS X Maximum Security is a large, extremely comprehensive volume. For the average person who wants to protect a small home network the information it provides is probably overkill. To make matters worse, the style is fairly verbose, particularly in the first section. Of course, if you want to secure a company network then you may need to know all the information -- and so all this background material is useful, if only so you can reach the right level of paranoia and suspicion.<br />The book is not a `recipe' book that tells you \\"take these steps and you will have a secure machine\\"; rather it takes you through the possible holes and how to fix them. This approach seems much better for security, since it teaches you a respect for the places you have to open up and a methodical approach to doing so that will hopefully carry over beyond the specifics addressed. Any recipe is bound to have flaws since the operating system and the services are all changing, I'm hoping the methods and style this book have imparted to me will last beyond any changes.<br />The book also deals well with all the Macintosh-specific stuff, informing you well about such topics as Rendezvous, Apple Remote Desktop, using NetInfo and the like. One aspect that isn't well covered is Airport; securing an 802.11 network is barely touched on.<br />The Bad<br />The information provided in all areas of the book is quite detailed, and includes many links to further places to look for more (and more recent) information. Once again, for a book in an ever-changing field like security, this is a huge benefit. I would have appreciated some sort of a small website devoted to the book with the links mentioned gathered together and perhaps some notes on how things may have changed since the book's publication. Unfortunately the Sams Publishing site has a broken link to the book and while the authors say \\"we are creating a security section for the [...]\\" no such section exists as I was writing this review. Frankly I am disappointed at this, I think with a book on this sort of topic it behooves either the publisher or author to provide a place for errata, discussion and notes. <br />My only real complaint with the book itself is the huge size, and the long-winded nature of some of the material. I found the first two sections in particular almost tedious and definitely lecturing in tone. I would have rated this book higher if the editors at Sams had taken a large red pencil to slabs of the first section. Overall, I'd say that while not a `must buy,' this book will have todo till I find something better, and I expect to loan my copy to several friends.	2004-04-06

Back then when someone said `script' they meant a shell script, generally for a Bourne shell.<br />Now that we have languages such as Perl and Python, much of shell scripting has been forgotten. The need still arises for the times and places where running Perl would be just that little bit too much overhead; cron jobs, process start and stop scripts, even machine start and stop scripts. For these we could best go back to the old ways. Combining the power of the common Unix tools, pipes and scripts in a fairly obscure and slightly arcane syntax is not easy to pick up, though the language's simplicity does, in some ways, make it easier than more complex ones such as Perl. Unix Shell Programming, Third Edition does a good job at introducing shell programming and I found it an excellent book when I needed a refresher.<br />I don't want to sell this volume short: you won't just learn about shell programming. The first ninety or so pages provide an excellent guide to getting the best out of the shell, and the last chapter is devoted to the features specific to an interactive shell such as command-line editing and using the history.<br />The authors have chosen to use the POSIX standard Bourne shell (`bash', available on many *nix systems, is a superset of the POSIX standard). That seems the right decision, given that it is so universally available and usually the default shell.<br />The book is well structured, starting out with a brief look at *nix operating systems before introducing the shell followed by some basic tools; cut, paste, sed, tr, grep, sort and uniq. One minor quibble, the book explains how to redirect STDOUT to a file and STDERR to a file, but not how to redirect both to the same file. That aside, these few chapters provide a good introduction to the shell.<br />The text goes on to systematically explore shell programming starting with variables and arithmetic. The chapters are kept short, in a good order and have a number of exercises at the end of each. The structure of the book and the order each new concept is introduced is well thought out; at each stage small examples are given that only use material already introduced and are complete in performing a task. In early chapters they are fairly trivial but by the end there is a fairly complete rolodex program written in shell script that would be a good model for anything you wished to do.<br />There is also a good summary of the shell syntax and common commands in Appendix A and good `Further Information' in Appendix B. Kudos must go to the authors for a list of books for further reading that is not ashamed of mentioning other publishers, indeed they say \\"One of the best sources of books on Unix-related topics is O'Reilly and Associates\\" and list volumes from them before mentioning their own publishers.<br />There are some small typographic errors in the text but I did not find any in the script examples I tried. I found it to be well written and readable throughout, perhaps an advantage of a third edition in a slow moving technology.<br />I would recommend everyone read this book once or twice, it provides a comprehensive, well written tutorial on one of the most basic (and often overlooked) tools at your disposal. Even Windows users could install Cygwin and gain the benefit of a good POSIX compliant shell and this book. It also has the advantage that once purchased it will be useful for many, many years to come - the language has not changed noticeably in twenty five years and should not change in another twenty five.	2004-04-06
US	46891942	RJKCVBPFRFOL	0130463469	123060330	Core PHP Programming (3rd Edition)	Books	4	7	8	N	N	A great book on PHP 5 at core	One of my key concerns when reviewing a good book is the pull between information density and a light, easily read style. I believe that as we get further along the learning curve we can sacrifice some readability for density -- we want more facts and less explanation.<br />The authors of Core PHP Programming have found a marvelous middle ground. Toward the beginning of the book they have a great deal of light, explanatory material as they cover the basics of PHP. As they move towards more advanced topics there is less explanation and a tighter packing of information. At the same time the book has a large number of small code examples throughout, making sure that you know how to use the functions under discussion.<br />This is the third edition and I must admit that I had not come across it in either the first or second editions, so I have no great way of comparing them in this review. It has certainly been revised to take into account the changes for PHP 5 and examining the table of contents for the second edition on Safari I can see the that the basic structure has remained the same while the book has grown about 300 pages. The addition of Zeev Suraski as co-author can only be to the benefit of the quality of the information, particularly regarding PHP 5.<br />The book starts with the absolute rock bottom of PHP, the basic data types and operators through to efficiency, debugging and design patterns. Along the way it covers almost all aspects of PHP 5 with a readable reference style. The `Core' in the title of this book is a key to understanding it. If you're looking for a book with all the code required to handle session management, or user logins and security (to mention two possibilities) then this isn't the book for you. If, however, you are after a book that more than adequately explains the power and nuances of PHP and programming in the language then this is a marvelous volume.<br />It's broken up into 5 sections: \\"Programming PHP,\\" which covers the basicsof data, control flow and I/O; \\"Functional Reference,\\" which is 600 odd pages broken up into 12 chapters that seems to cover every PHP function (a check of three sub chapters showed every function mentioned on the topic at PHP.net was also in the book) and does it well with good explanation and code examples; \\"Algorithms,\\" which details a number of methods of performing routine tasks such as sorting, parsing and generating graphics; and \\"Software Engineering,\\" devoted to design, efficiency and design patterns; and finally, there are a seven excellent appendices.<br />Taken as a whole it does a good job of covering the whole language and the ways of using it.<br />I can imagine it would make a good companion volume to my other favourite PHP volume, PHP and MySQL Web Development, which tends more towards recipes and leaves out the encyclopedic coverage of this book.<br />Leon Atkinson has a good web page for the book that includes a link to download all the code and examples, a link to the Prentice Hall page for those wanting an example chapter or a look at the Table of Contents and some other reviews. His site also has a page for the inevitable errata, currently blank. While I did find only one typo (not in example code) I can't claim to have read every page or run all the code examples.<br />I'd recommend this volume to anyone who wanted a comprehensive guide to PHP 5. It is probably useful at almost all levels.	2004-04-06
US	46891942	R1P0R3DR2U7PNU	0596001916	3512697	Apache Cookbook	Books	4	48	49	N	N	Recipes for success from two experts	While Apache is possibly the most popular and ubiquitous open source project it is certainly not the most simple. One module alone, mod_rewrite, causes me almost more problems and regex wrestling matches than all other products combined. The `httpd.conf' file is a long and critical one. In these circumstances the Apache Cookbook from O'Reilly might be a godsend. It is certainly a well-written, well-researched volume. Ken Coar has spent many years working on Apache and Rich Bowen has long laboured on the Apache documentation. They both know their stuff -- and if this is an example, both know how to write.<br />The book has twelve chapters, covering everything from installation and adding modules through to proxies and performance. The chapter on security is the largest, it covers the topics well. By contrast I thought the chapter `Aliases, Redirection and Rewriting' too short and could have benefited from some more `recipes', but that may be due to my own bias - mod_rewrite is not an easy topic, and as I've said it causes me a great deal of grief.<br />It is laid out in a similar way to the Perl Cookbook: each recipe has a `Problem' section followed by a `Solution' and then `Discussion.' In almost all the `recipes' the `Discussion' is longer than the `Solution,' and I often found it far more useful and informative than the problem and its solution.<br />The Apache Cookbook covers almost all aspects and all parts of the learning curve for Apache. That will either be a strength or a weakness of this volume for you; with such a large and complex piece of software as Apache a single book cannot hope to cover it in a great deal of depth. For me this book was not really a cookbook, more a good source of well documented examples from which to create my own recipes,<br />My biggest problem reviewing a book like this is that after several years building and configuring Apache (even on an infrequent basis) quite a lot of this volume seems simple. You may also find it the sameif you are the sort of person who is not afraid to pore over the documentation, get your hands dirty and make a few mistakes. If you like some hand holding and are just starting with Apache you may benefit from all of it.<br />That's not to say that I didn't personally find large chunks of this volume useful. Certainly I've gone over several of the recipes and their excellent explanatory text to shed some light on previously dark corners of Apache, particularly as the authors cover both Apache 1.3 and 2.0.<br />O'Reilly have the usual web page with a Table of Contents and example chapter. The example chapter, on error handling is well chosen as it is typical of the others and useful but not the most useful chapter.<br />I have recently been thinking that tech books fall into various sorts and there is one sort I'd call `library books' - books you may not need to own, but will want to read every so often and would be good to have in your local or company library. Apache Cookbook is one of these, a book I'd recommend everyone coming to grips with Apache has close to hand, but it is not going to be constantly on your desk in the same way that Perl Cookbook might be for Perl programmers: to start off with, it's half the size and doesn't cover nearly as many topics. This one falls short of essential due to it's concentration on breadth. rather than depth. So my recommendation for this book is not that all Apache administrators should buy it, but you should have a copy close at hand.	2004-04-06
US	46891942	R2W5JZPZBGJZ3L	0131423630	868925063	Online! The Book	Books	1	3	5	N	N	Hyperbole! The Book	Titling a volume `Online! The Book' and putting \\"The perfect gift for any computer user!\\" amongst other hyperbole on the back cover must rank as this years greatest act of hubris.<br />If only John C. Dvorak and Chris Pirillo (with Wendy Taylor) had been able to deliver. If only they had not strewn the book with error, verbiage and irrelevancy. Ah, well.<br />This volume in its 700 pages (divided into 28 chapters) tries to cover everything from hardware basics to voice over IP, in between touching on e-commerce, security, web programming, networking, content management and business websites, to name just six of the topics perhaps each better suited to a volume of their own.<br />This book skims, and skims fast, over a number of important and vital topics while dwelling on others that many will find useless. Chris Pirillo seems to be an expert on marketing, so that gets thirty pages, while web programming languages get ten. We get forty pages of `Hardware Basics,' which cover information vital to getting online such as operating systems, varieties of Intel chips, video cards and gaming audio drivers. I know that if I wanted to find the perfect spot to put sidebars about Babbage and von Neumann (essential to any book about getting online) I'd put them in the chapter on viruses. It seems as if the three authors said \\"we're contracted to seven hundred pages so let's just throw in topics we know a lot about until we get to seven hundred pages -- then stop.\\"<br />Then there are the errors. We get editing errors like the text that tells us a `geostationary satellite' orbits at `about 22,300 miles,' next to a diagram showing the number 20,300 miles. We get errors in logic like the sidebar that has \\"DNS servers may run Apache, which is an open source Web server program\\" and goes on to imply that all DNS servers will run a web server. We get errors in grammar. We get paragraphs like \\"Although there are dynamic Web page URLs (meaning they change, or at least part of it does),most are static (stay the same). These can be dynamic by use of a programming error or dynamic because someone named the URL extension without adding a link elsewhere on the web site.\\" With sentence construction like that I'm still not sure if the claim intended is true or not.<br />Did I like anything about this book? Sure, the chapter on `How A Modem (Really) Works' was full of good solid information. Other chapters were similar, particularly the two following on networking and handhelds, phones and PDAs. Others did contain some good information, just surrounded by dross.<br />You can go to the book's website, which is basically just a single page with yet more hyperbole (\\"Everything is here. Well-written. Comprehensive.\\") or visit the Prentice Hall page, which actually gives you a table of contents and a sample chapter. Just don't go straight to the Prentice Hall PTR home page and search for books with \\"Online\\" in the title, as that won't find it. Instead search for books with \\"Book\\" in the title.<br />I'd only recommend this book to those who want to spend a lot of time finding the good bits, a few minutes chuckling over some of the errors, and thirty dollars on a paperweight. If you're really looking for a `perfect gift' for people new new to the net, then find something cheaper covering just the essentials, and for those more expert, find a volume that actually covers a topic of interest well.	2004-04-06
US	46891942	R1QNQ6ONXH06G6	0130091154	523091433	The Linux Development Platform	Books	3	8	8	N	N	A good guide to developers tools	Back before the advent of Mac OS X, my favourite (and for many years, only) development environment was one variety of Unix or another. The nicest thing about Unix was that the development environment stayed pretty much the same regardless of the variety; this stayed the same with the introduction of Linux.<br />The Linux Development Platform might be better titled &quot;The GNU Development Platform&quot; since almost all of the tools discussed come from the FSF, and those that don't are nevertheless open source; as a result they will run on almost any Unix variety. You know that the 'Linux' in the title is almost just a marketing ploy, but we will forgive Prentice Hall and the authors. Certainly more people will buy this book to learn about using these tools under Linux than under any other *nix variety.<br />The book starts with a short chapter on software development per se before getting down to the nuts and bolts. It starts in the obvious spot, with editors, and quickly covers choosing an editor before taking a brief look at Emacs, Jed and VIM. The rest of the book is devoted to much less contentious issues.<br />As a whole, the text provides a good grounding in using gcc, make, CVS and GDB, with enough extra information on smaller tools and larger issues (such as cross-platform and embedded systems) that you will not need more than this book and, perhaps, the man pages to understand and use these tools. Of course others, have written entire volumes on each of these topics, but for most of us this book will provide the information we need.<br />The Linux Development Platform comes with a CD containing the source for a fair number of the tools discussed, so you can build any tools which happen to be missing on your platform, though some of the included apps are, of course, already a version or two behind.<br />The writing is mixed in quality: while never bad, it has a slightly heavy, technical feel to it, often a bit wordy or cumbersome. This rarely gets in theway of understanding, but it does slow you down. The topic coverage is good, moving from a beginner level right through to a good understanding of each tool discussed. More importantly, all the tools you will need are covered.<br />I imagine this would make an excellent companion text for any programming course: note that it doesn't provide details on any programming language, but covers everything else you need to know regarding the development tools. It is thinnest in the discussion of editors, really only giving a brief overview of each. I cannot really see this as a fault since detailed coverage really would take a separate book, and this quick look is better than pretending to cover the topic well and failing. The other possible weakness is that there is almost no coverage of general Linux usage, so calling the book The Linux Development Platform is a bit of a misnomer -- it is really devoted to the tools available for development, not the underlying operating system at all. Once again, I feel that this lack is not serious; most buyers should know enough about the operating system and any attempt to cover it adequately would have swelled the size and cost of the book.<br />Prentice Hall PTR have a site for the book with a Table of Contents or you can see the whole book in HTML format at FAQs.org.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who would like a good, general introduction to developing software on a Unix platform. Though it's not a cheap book, it is a good one. It was certainly a relief for me to find a good book in Prentice Hall's 'Bruce Peren Open Source Series' after a couple of flawed ones. I've marked it three stars rather than four (and it really deserves a three and a half) for the slightly clunky writing.	2004-02-23
US	46891942	R3MVPMUUZBM7FG	0672324547	356972119	HTTP Developer's Handbook	Books	4	19	20	N	N	Clear and informative guide to HTTP	To say that understanding HTTP is crucial for web development might seem like saying water is wet, yet many people don't take the time to fully understand the protocol. This book could be a good help. HTTP Developer's Handbook  from SAMS gives you a great deal of information about the protocol in a clearly understood fashion.<br />One of the strangest feelings I've ever had reading a book is that I have a better opinion of it than does the author. Shiflett spends most of the introduction convincing the reader that this is a useful book and it seems that the start of most chapters is another few sentences telling me why the chapter is incredibly useful for me to read. I felt like yelling \\"I'm convinced, I'm convinced.\\"<br />The book is broken up into 6 parts: `Introducing HTTP,' `HTTP Definition,' `Maintaining State,' `Performance,' `Security,' and `Evolution of HTTP.'<br />The first section and a large part of the introduction are the sort of information that is covered elsewhere in just as good a detail: it basically covers the obvious. The second section covers the HTTP protocol itself, with a good discussion of requests and responses, including all the nitty gritty details of the headers in some detail. This is the really useful heart of the book and it covers 80 of the 280 pages. The third, fourth and fifth sections give a too-concise look at their subject matter, I felt the book could have given much more detail here. The last section is a waste of space; in this volume I don't really need to have a small amount of information about SOAP and XML-RPC.<br />This book is well-written; I believe its two fatal flaws are that Shiflett seems unsure of his own book and that the book itself tries to offer everything for a developer while explaining it all for the newcomer. I think that had Shiflett given up on the newcomer and given the developer greater depth (with a lot more examples) he would have delivered a much better book. For a developer, the volume is much toolight on example code, the book is not really `practical,' more `informative.'<br />This might be a good volume for a library, either a corporate or school library. It provides the salient information in one spot in a concise and readable manner. I think that an individual might find it a less than totally useful book for the money -- you're likely to have already have a volume or two that covers most of the information, and with most languages in web development having libraries that take care of most of the low-level stuff for you, it becomes less and less necessary to really understand the bottom level. Personally, I'll keep it for the 80 page section on the HTTP definition so I have it all in one spot.	2004-02-19
US	46891942	R7HJ7N5ZKZ9VR	0596002270	769153240	Practical mod_perl	Books	4	14	14	N	N	Useful, informative volume on mod_perl	Practical mod_perl is a doorstop sized volume that provides more information on using mod_perl than you ever thought you needed.<br />The almost 900 pages are divided into five parts and a bunch of appendices. Part I, \\"mod_perl Administration\\" covers building, configuring and installing mod_perl, followed by some Apache details and an 80-page guide to coding with mod_perl in mind. Part II, `mod_perl Performance' deals with ways of getting the best out of Apache and mod_perl, with a little about security. Part III deals with databases, including persistent connections and data sharing. Part IV is a great guide to debugging and troubleshooting. Part V is a brief look at Apache 2 and mod_perl 2.<br />The appendices are useful. The first is a short section of around a dozen small `recipes' for performing various tasks using mod_perl. I found these a good base for more complex tasks, particularly when combined with examples from elsewhere in the book. The second is a list of Perl modules that extend Apache and mod_perl with a brief description of each. The third gives some strategies for providers wanting to host Apache with mod_perl. The fourth and fifth give good overviews of the Template Toolkit and AxKit, an XML application server built on mod_perl.<br />The book is readable, tending towards heavy writing and certainly dense, but I didn't feel this was a problem in a book meant for a fairly advanced audience. I think you'd want to be a fairly good Perl programmer and well versed in Apache before needing this volume and shouldn't expect to be spoon fed. I thought it well written.<br />In a book of this size you expect to find a lot of example code, and you won't be disappointed. The book is peppered with short Perl examples and example command lines and configurations, all well explained. The one shortcoming is that there aren't many examples of full-blown applications where you can see everything discussed and have it explained all in one place. I would have appreciated some more of this, the examples tend to be on the short side.<br />This book sits well in the marketplace. It provides more details on running, installing and configuring mod_perl and Apache than mod_perl Developer's Cookbook (and also delves more into the reasons for doing something one particular way and much more help on debugging), though the Developer's Cookbookbecomes a good companion to this volume as it provides a lot more in the way of examples. For those that want to get deep into the high end of mod_perl there is Writing Apache Modules in Perl and C, which is at core a good book on high end mod_perl programming.<br />O'Reilly have their usual website with Table of Contents, an example chapter, and errata. The authors have their own website with some of the same information and all the code examples from the book as both individual files and one 40k tarball.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who administers and writes for mod_perl, it fills the missing pieces in mod_perl Developers Cookbook and is a good companion volume to it.	2004-02-19

The drawback to this is that I often find myself ignoring the more powerful aspects of the application and never using it to its full. It was here that the Missing Manual came to my help.<br />The target audience for this book would probably be a little less technical than myself, however when I find myself in a field I don't understand well I don't mind a little stuff for the absolute newbie. This book has an entire first section that deals with photography and digital photography in particular that may be a total repeat for some, I found it a welcome reminder of how to get a good photograph along with some extremely useful hints about the new technology and choosing a camera. It covers such topics as composition and lighting for a host of different situations such as landscapes, night, portraits, children and sports.<br />It then goes on to a section of similar size on the basics that covers getting the photos from your camera to the Mac, organising the photos using albums and keywords and then editing your shots.<br />A third section covers the various ways of publishing and showing your photos such as printing, CD, and web pages, and a final section with some tricks and tips on things like managing your libraries. There are two appendices: one very useful troubleshooting guide, and a menu-by-menu look at iPhoto 2.<br />I particularly appreciated the thorough treatment of how to get the most out of iPhoto when printing photo books and creating web pages in the third section; it was here that I really discovered how little I knew from just `playing' with the application. The book is pepperedwith useful information and tips that take you beyond the level that most of us discovered when we ran and used the program. The authors have also provided some marvelous explanations of what is going on, the \\"why\\" as well as the \\"what.\\"<br />The book is well written with a readable, light, almost witty style that somehow deceives the reader as to the depth of the material being covered. It is only when I reflected back on how much the book taught me that I realised how well it had done the job.<br />O'Reilly have their usual web page for the book with a sample chapter, Table of Contents and Index. Pogue Press have a neat idea - they have a page that features all the software mentioned in the book. A neat idea that I liked a lot.<br />In conclusion, I would recommend this book to everyone who is serious about digital photography on their Mac. If you have used iPhoto for a long time you may think the book a waste, but I'd be surprised if even long-time users didn't get their money's worth out of this book. I much preferred the style of this volume to IDG's iPhoto 2 for Dummies, the only other real competitor for this volume was iPhoto 2 for Mac OS X: A Visual Quickstart Guide, and that is a shorter volume with less depth and less advice for photography and nothing on the camera technology, though I think Engst's writing seems a bit clearer at times.<br />I wouldn't buy a \\"Missing Manual\\" for every iApp or the operating system, but if you take the slogan for the series seriously, \\"The book that should have been in the box\\" (for the box is entirely devoid of books), I think they are a marvelous help for becoming a true `power user.	2004-02-15
US	46891942	R28HEL2TQX293S	0596005776	619479714	Spidering Hacks	Books	4	33	34	N	N	Good book with a light start	The `Hacks' series from O'Reilly seems to be breeding as fast as virii in a Windows network - every time you turn around another one. While the writing and editing have remained high some such as `eBay Hacks' have not really had great material. `Spidering Hacks' is an improvement almost back to the quality I remember in the last contribution from Calishain, `Google Hacks'.<br />She and Kevin Hemenway have taken a fairly complex topic, spidering and scraping web sites and reduced it to manageable chunks in their hundred hacks. The writing has the same light, readable feel you can quickly grow to expect from O'Reilly. Certainly I have never found myself faulting their editing.<br />There are some caveats. It seems that O'Reilly and Dornfest (the Editor of this book and the series) have fallen in love with having a hundred hacks and little in the way of an introduction. I think this may have been a better book if it was done as 90 `hacks' and had a much larger introduction as the first chapters hacks are all too light and more truly introductory material such as how a HTML page is built and how to properly register your spider. Given that only someone with a fair amount of web knowledge is going to consider spidering a website in the first place then this early material is way too slight. From Hack 9 on it quickly gets down to useful and informative chunks in each and no longer feels `lightweight'.<br />This may be a reflection on trying to extend the `Hacks' series into places it has to be forced. While the format worked well for Google and Amazon I felt the entire topic of eBay too light for a topic in this series and perhaps spidering is too heavy or complex. If this book had been written in a more traditional format some of my complaints would disappear.<br />All the examples are in Perl and the serious part of the book starts with examples using LWP::Simple to grab a page before going on to LWP::UserAgent and much more complex requests using authentication, customheaders and posting form data. It also covers using curl and wget.<br />Then it gets down to the nitty gritty of scraping using HTML:Treebuilder and HTML:TokeParser. This is all further expanded through the next few hacks until starting at Hack 39 through to 89 there are a good series of examples (perhaps a few too many). Finally there are two chapters on maintaining your collection and `Giving Back To The World' which tells how to make it easy to scrape your site and using RSS.<br />O'Reilly have a page for the book with ten example hacks, index, Table of Contents and errata and you can also visit hacks.oreilly.com for the same ten hacks with the possibility of more being added.<br />As a whole this volume seems a little thin. If you've been doing the maths then you've realised that only about thirty of the hundred hacks actually give any details on building and running a serious web spider. Sure, a number of the examples provide good information on how to perform various tasks and some of the last eleven hacks are good to know but in all the book feels like it lacks solid information throughout. A bit more information on various crawling and page parsing techniques would have been good.<br />After that criticism I'm now surprising myself, I'm going to recommend this book. This isn't a large field and when you consider that most other books on writing spiders and crawlers are less than practical and more than expensive \\"Spidering Hacks\\" has many good points. It's written for the practical Perl programmer, it examines several methods and gives lots of examples and while not cheap it's certainly inexpensive. Given that I found it both useful and inspiring the complaints above may be a little like nitpicking. I should also say that I found this volume immensely useful in writing my own spider and scraper (it gets a list of new books from the web sites of several publishers.) I have to be honest and admit that there are three publishers, O'Reilly, Addison Wesley and Prentice Hall, from whom I expect a decent standard and criticise a little harder when they move from that norm. If this book had come from SAMS or Wrox I may well have not looked quite so hard for flaws and been a little more generous in my treatment of the ones I found.<br />That said, I recommend this book to you if you want a practical introduction to building a web spider in Perl.	2004-02-15

It certainly appealed to roughly the same audience, those who wanted a short, sharp introduction to a programming language. It was with a problem that needed solving and a copy of the camel book that I started as a Perl programmer.<br />Then for those that wanted a introduction to Perl and programming Randal L. Schwartz wrote Learning Perl, a book that has arguably become the definitive textbook for teaching Perl. The one weakness was that it left off before really getting to the guts of building large, complex projects in Perl. It did not cover classes, objects, breaking your code up into pieces or the more arcane aspects of variables, references. For this we had to resort to the last few chapters of the 'camel book' and I, for one, have never really been totally comfortable at this end of the language; when I'm reading someone else's code it might take a couple of reads to fully understand the process. <br />Now this weakness has been well and truly addressed. Schwartz, with Tom Phoenix, has written &quot;Learning Perl Objects, References &amp; Modules&quot;, a volume that takes the same steady approach to teaching you the more advanced topics as the earlier 'Learning Perl'. Schwartz has spent the years since writing 'Learning Perl' teaching and writing. You can tell, this is a superbly written book, not that 'Learning Perl' wasn't well written; it's just that this volume is far better. <br />The Guts <br />The book starts with a chapter on building larger programs that covers @INC, eval, do and require before discussing packages and scope. It then has several chapters on references that explains in well understandable fashion and increasing complexity all the ins and outs of references including dereferencing, nested references, references to subroutines and references to anonymous data before a final chapter on references that gives you some incredibly useful tricks such as sorting and recursively defining complex data. <br />The book continues with three chapters that give you a solid grounding in Perl objects. Here Schwartz has assumed that you know at least a little about object oriented programming, some may feel the need for more explanation of concepts might be required, but if you've had any experience in OOP before then the clear examples and descriptions here are probably all you want. <br />Modules are not as well covered, with only a single chapter, but it is hard to think of anything left out, it covers using them and building your own so well that it left me wondering what all the fuss was about, &quot;seems obvious to me.&quot;  The book concludes with chapters on building a distribution out of your module, testing it using make test (with Test::Harness), Test::Simple and Test::More before a chapter telling you how to contribute to CPAN. <br />Each chapter of the book concludes with a number of small exercises, designed to be done in just a few minutes, that cement the learning of the previous chapter. The answers to these are at the end of the book. <br />Conclusion <br />Once I'd finished I felt I had a much more solid grounding in Perl, certainly I was much better able to understand another programmer's code that dealt with such things as subroutine references and some complex data structures. While the subject matter of this book is almost entirely covered in 'Programming Perl' the tutorial aspects of this book made it much easier going. The style would be familiar to anyone who has read 'Learning Perl', light without being frivolous and extremely well written, Schwartz seems a master at reducing complexity to manageable bites. <br />This book is deceptively easy to follow, each new idea built onto earlier ones, each new language concept introduced in an easy manner. The writing is excellent, it's hard to explain why I appreciated it so much. That may be the reason, the writingisn't forced or heavy or too light or obvious. It just allows the solid material of the book to shine through. Go to the ubiquitous O'Reilly website and grab the example chapter (the site also has a few Errata, the Table of Contents and the code from the book) and give it a look. <br />I think this may well become a classic, I may well in ten years time talk of Schwartz's books with the same awe I now talk of Brian Kernighan's. I'll certainly eagerly await his next book and keep this one close until it comes. Oh, and Randal, how about 'Software Tools for Perl Programmers'?	2003-09-03

It is subtitled \\"The Race to Crack the Hieroglyph Code,\\" and starts with a short chapter that introduces the eventual winner of that race, the Frenchman Jean-Francois Champollion, and mentions his most serious rival, the Englishman Thomas Young.<br />The book goes on to examine Napoleon's expedition to Egypt which both brought the Rosetta Stone to light and started a period of French and European fascination with ancient Egypt. These were the two catalysts for the riddle's eventual solution.<br />This is a well-written book that looks at the struggle and race for translation and the political and academic machinations (often both combined) that surrounded Champollion. It is essentially a biography of Champollion, who grew up and worked amid the turmoil of the Napoleonic era. The story is a compelling one and the authors have done well to make it at times fascinating, though it does lack some technical detail of exactly how Champollion attacked the problem.<br />As a genre I find that 'scientific biographies' tend to be a little overblown and flowery, the writing not quite precise -- and Keys suffers from these shortcomings. I also felt that while the book is subtitled \\"The Race to Crack the Hieroglyph Code\\" it really only focuses on Champollion, while he is the eventual winner a little more effort in examining the others involved in the effort would have improved the book.	2003-09-03

'In The Beginning' has at its core the story of biblical translation, a topic you may think anything but fascinating. McGrath has done a good job in making this a compelling book.  <br />He starts, as one may expect, with the story of Gutenberg and his first printed bibles. Before arriving at the King James he covers Martin Luther, the rise of Protestantism in Europe, Henry the Eighth, more than one hanging, and several other bible translations and translators. Along the way he manages to dispel a few myths I had held about biblical translation and the King James in particular. I always thought that it was the King James version that introduced the idea of the main body in roman type and words inserted to clarify meaning in italics, but it was actually an earlier English translation known as the Geneva Bible that first implemented this idea. After explaining the technology, theology, politics and linguistics nuances that led King James to permit (but not fund) a new translation, McGrath tells us how the translation was accomplished organizationally before examining some of the nuances of the translation itself. Some of the language in the King James was archaic even when it was published; translators had been instructed to lift from previous translations all the way back to the partial translation of William Tyndale published 90 years earlier, and this at a time when the English language was going through the huge changes of the Elizabethan era. McGrath examines this aspect, pointing out such things as  changes in verb endings and personal pronouns.<br />I found the book patchy. McGrath does a much better job covering the story up until the translation. It is harder to get a feel for how the translation was accomplished and how the various teams worked, and when he comes to examine some of the nuances of the translation, the text makes much hardergoing. If this had not been a part of the topic that interested me a great deal, I may have lost interest.	2003-09-03

Grabbing a copy of 'Learning Java' from O'Reilly I started learning. <br />Of course, you can't learn Java without a good understanding of object-oriented languages. I made fairly heavy going with 'Learning Java' until I decided to dive in head first, 'Head First Java' that is - I bought this book that has a totally different attitude to teaching than I've seen before  in computer books. The style is humorous, full of graphics, cartoons, puzzles, quizzes and crosswords. It reminds me of the textbooks that used to try and teach me geometry and algebra in high school or my daughters elementary books on Roman and Greek history I purchased for her at the British Museum. The style didn't work to teach me much algebra and geometry, but I wasn't anywhere near as motivated. This time, it worked. In a couple of weeks I worked through the book and finally have Java skills where I can branch off and start coding the projects I had in mind (though something more advanced will be  required soon.)<br />In the introduction the authors examine learning and explain why they designed the book as they did. To quote from one section: &quot;Some of the Head First learning principles. Make it visual. Put the words within or near the graphics. Use a conversational and personalized style. Get the learner to think more deeply. Get-and keep-the reader's attention. Touch their emotions.&quot; They argue that our brain is tuned to novelty, and that their style provides the novelty to keep your brain turned on. They also provide ten tips for good learning. That's one thing that seems to set this book apart from most other computer books, they say they think of their reader as a learner and indeed that's the way you are treated by the book. <br />The book also has a good emphasis on test-driven development, a good style to get new programmers started. I also appreciated the excellent chapter on how to package all your code up for release, something thatyou might expect to be trivial but not quite as easy as expected.<br />When compared to 'Learning Java' the coverage is not as good, 'Head First' really only covers the basics, up to and including creating a GUI with SWING and then touches a number of others; 'Learning Java' goes on to explore, with a fair depth, network programming, web programming, servlets, applets, Java Beans, XML and other topics that are only touched on briefly in 'Head First.' If the style of learning does not  suit you then this will be an incredibly irritating and useless book, I'd give it a try first, though. <br />This edition also has a fair number of errors, including some in the examples. To this all I can say is &quot;shame, shame, shame.&quot; I keep on harping on this in computer book reviews but if you can't figure out a way of including code that compiles and/or runs in your book then give up. The example code is available online - how hard is it to check that it all runs and then include that source directly into the text.<br />When you get down to it, though, the only way to really decide on the worth of a tutorial is to decide how well it teaches. 'Head First Java' excels at teaching. OK, I thought it was silly, I had a hard time making myself do the exercises, fill out the crosswords and solve the puzzles. Then I realized that I was thoroughly learning the topics as I went through the book. 'Learning Java' was doing the same job, but the dry traditional method wasn't doing as well. Both books are well written, designed and constructed-the style of 'Headfirst Java' just made learning, well, easier. <br />It would seem to me that the 'Head First' approach is going to work wonderfully for the more 'beginner' topics, books for introducing you to a new style of programming, a new language  or a radically different operating system or application. So if you're looking for a book to introduce you to Java then I can recommend 'Head First Java'. Now if I could only find a book as goodto introduce me to Common Lisp.	2003-08-19

Indeed this is the second edition and seems supremely up to date.<br /><br />Goodman has tackled a complex subject. With changing standards and even quicker changing browser compatibility it can be a nightmare trying to get a dynamic web site working across disparate browsers and operating systems. A guide that tells you exact syntax and exact compatibility can be invaluable, but is only as good as the research behind it, an area where I cannot fault Goodman.<br /><br />This volume covers XHTML, CSS and DOM with a large smidgeon of JavaScript. It's not an easy book to get into and consume in large chunks as it does little hand holding but as I was prepared to knuckle down and work at the topics, I found it perfect for me. Goodman has recently released JavaScript &amp; DHTML Cookbook which I have found to be a marvelous volume to assist the process of understanding these technologies.<br /><br />The target audience would be best summed up as those who have done a fair amount of HTML hand coding and some work in dynamic HTML. The book also adds that you should have &quot;the basics of client-side scripting in JavaScript&quot; and I would agree, when I first acquired this book my JavaScript skills were exceptionally primitive (mainly at the 'plug in example' stage) and found the latter sections of this book heavy going and not much help; now that I am a better JavaScript programmer I find these parts much easier to understand and use.<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts, 'Applying Dynamic HTML', 'Dynamic HTML Reference', 'Cross References' and 'Appendixes'. I found the first Part particularly helpful when converting my old site across to a more dynamic CSS based site as it helps with various strategies for making sure your content works across browsers and various methods for making sure that visitors with older browsers and search engines can still retrieve valid pages. Goodman's approach of increasing complexity through this Part also suited a movement from a straight HTML site to one using XHTML and CSS. This is also where Goodman's writing can shine, it's an excellent guide to all the technologies and acronym soup. The appendices are marvelous, from 'A', a list of colour names with their RGB value, through a list of character entities to a 50 page list of all HTML tags, their attributes and if they are supported in the two HTML 4 and three XHTML 1 standards.<br /><br />The reference Parts are well structured with extensive notes on browser support and which particular standard (DOM 1, DOM 2, CSS 1, CSS 2, or none) the tag or attribute comes from. For example, in the DOM section the reference gives you the object name, which versions of Navigator and Explorer support it, the DOM version (if any), a short explanation, then an object reference example, list of properties, methods and event handlers. For each of the properties it gives an example, the type and if it is read-only or read/write. For methods it gives the return value and parameters. This sort of attention to fine detail is throughout the book. You end up with a book 1343 pages long and a 51 page index. Goodman mentions in his Preface that the book now encompasses 'more than 15,000 unique instances of properties, methods and event handlers', a figure I'd believe.<br /><br />I found this a hard book to review, as are most references. The questions I asked were: one, does the book cover all the material; two, is it correct; three, is it easy to find the entry you want and four, are the entries laid out in an easy to understand manner? In these criteria this volume rates well, with the added bonus of some good material in the first section for understanding the nuances of dynamic HTML in multiple browser, multiple operating system world.<br /><br/>If you are doing a lot of work in Dynamic HTML then this book is probably an essential. While I don't consult it every time I start working on HTML when I run into trouble it is the first place I turn to make sure my syntax and browser compatibility are straight. This book ain't cheap, and it ain't small but I'd recommend it for your desk if you're working with web sites.	2003-08-06
US	46891942	R194Q0TJ58FEOT	067232525X	387194651	PHP and MySQL Web Development, Second Edition	Books	5	8	8	N	N	May well be the classic text	I wrote a rave review of the first edition of this book. For this second edition, I would add that Welling and Thomson have updated extensively and improved slightly a book that may well be the classic text on the topic.<br />PHP and MySQL are probably the most pervasive add-ons to Apache web servers across the web. Certainly they are both easy to acquire and common on a large range of web hosting systems, including several extremely low-cost ones. They also fit together extremely well.<br />This book demonstrates just how well. It starts out with a quick course in PHP (OK, 160 pages is hardly quick but it seems to move along at a good pace), follows it up with a brief look at MySQL before a short digression on E-commerce leads into building authentication and secure systems with the two tools (a marvelous place to start when you're thinking about commercial-grade web systems).<br />Then, after some more on PHP, the final section covers some large projects; a shopping cart, email service, mailing list manager and web forums. The final chapter in this section is new for this edition and covers XML and SOAP.<br />The new edition has been updated extensively. All scripts work now perfectly in PHP 4.3<br />I like this book a great deal. Even after a fair amount of time with the previous edition I still find it useful. It is well structured for finding what you need, well written, and has only a few typos. (Though there are still some, including ones in code examples -- when will authors learn to work straight off running code into the manuscript and keep godforsaken editors away from it? Brian Kernighan managed it twenty-five years ago.)<br />This would not be the best book if you had little programming experience, nor would it be the best book if you had a fair amount of PHP experience.<br />You will want to have some program design experience and preferably some experience with database design as these are given short shrift. The book also lacks examples and discussion of some of the less database intensive parts of PHP and some of the more obscure tasks you may need to perform. It covers what someone who has programmed before needs to know about both PHP and MySQL while informing on methods of using both to build practical and sturdy web applications. If that sounds like the book you want then I heartily recommend this volume to you.	2003-06-28
US	46891942	R3C2YMP594APE4	0782141188	962800684	Mastering Mac OS X	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Good guide to OS X for intermediate users	I've seen a fair number of books for OS X and they range in target audience from the raw beginner such as Mac OS X for Dummies and Robin William's Mac OS X Book through to those for technical readers such as Mac OS X In A Nutshell (IAN).<br />Mastering Mac OS X falls firmly in the middle. Unlike IAN it spends a fair amount of time on the GUI and a major section is devoted to QuickTime and the iApps. Unlike Robin William's volume it covers high end topics such as AppleScript and the terminal and has a good section on troubleshooting. One thing lacking that I applaud is that it does not have IAN's large chapter summing up Unix commands.<br />The Good<br />The book is well structured, divided into 7 sections, 5 of increasing complexity, 'The Mac OS X Basics', 'On The Internet', 'Multimedia: Images Sound, Video', 'Networking, Coonectivity and Portables' and 'Advanced Mac OS X topics' - which covers AppleScript, the Terminal, and various servers including QuickTime, Samba and Sendmail. These are followed by a hardware and troubleshooting section and finally the appendices. The index is good and it has the by now traditional two level table of contents, the first listing just the chapter heads and the second listing all the sub sections as well.<br />Given that structure, the book touches all the bases and covers all the required topics well.<br />The writing is not bad, I think a stronger hand with the editing would have done wonders as it tends to the wordy.<br />The Bad<br />Once again a certain amount of the early stuff is either below the needs of the target audience or not really required. Oh, and Sybex do have a page for the book...!OpenDocument which includes a Table of Contents, sample chapter, index and errata but get a load of that URL and the author has a web page for the book but he hasn't touched it in over a year, since before this second edition was published.<br />Conclusion<br />It should be said that among all the books in this genre none are badly written, or badly structured. Personally I don't like the style of the 'Dummies' books and so I put it at the bottom of my list but others may not have the same feeling. That said, how do you choose among them? The choice boils down to two things, how close you are to the target audience for a particular book and how well it addresses the target audience. Mastering Mac OS X is targeted at \\"intermediate beginners (those who have some experience with a graphical operating system) and solidly intermediate to advanced users\\" according to the Introduction. I think that it covers the needs of the first group well but will probably fall short if you are already an \\"advanced user.\\" For these people I'd recommend Mac OS X In A Nutshell. If you are a total newbie, then I'd recommend Robin William's Mac OS X Book.	2003-06-28
US	46891942	R2PSEDLVRN3RH0	0596004605	824873719	Mac OS X Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tricks	Books	4	14	15	N	N	A mixed bag of tips and tricks	'Mac OS X Hacks' is a good grab bag of tips and techniques for getting the most from your Mac. While the tips are not as universally appealing (even among Mac owners) as those in 'Google Hacks' most people will find some value in the selection; some may find it a little thin.<br />The book is split into 9 chapters; 'Files', 'Startup&quot;, 'Multimedia and the iApps', 'The User Interface', 'Unix and the Terminal', 'Networking', 'Email', 'The Web' and 'Databases'. <br />For my money the last chapter is a complete waste of space since it only covers installing MySQL and PostgresSQL, and if you can't figure out how to install them from the documentation then you shouldn't use them. A number of the other tips would come close to that level, I feel their only use may be to encourage people who would otherwise stay away to make some use of the terminal and similar tools.<br />When I first started reviewing the book I would have complained about a large number of the tips being too application specific, too general or too low in skill level. Since then I've had a friend who wanted to edit a movie and we both found the chapter on iApps useful, one with a brand new Bluetooth phone who liked the couple of tips on Bluetooth and another who found the cross platform Windows-Mac stuff useful. So I have to say that while some of the tips might seem useless now you may come to appreciate them later.<br />Overall the book is well written, well laid out and well cross-referenced and covers a wide range of information.<br />My one major beef is still that there are too many 'tips' that are well covered by other material. Since you shouldn't really get this book until you are at least Mac proficient and probably own a basic Mac book or two then perhaps a tenth of the hundred tips will be covered in most Mac books and perhaps another five to ten you will have discovered on your own.<br />Reading over my notes I feel split between raving about how good the book is - well written with a bunch of useful tips and tricks for any Mac user - and complaining about the useless nature of some of the tips. So I am left saying that if the book falls into your definition of 'inexpensive' then grab a copy. If the price is 'expensive' then just make sure a friend owns a copy and borrow theirs every so often.	2003-06-11
US	46891942	R3Q995XWM3XAD7	0596004516	423030921	Mac OS X Hints	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A good book from a great site	Mac OS X Hints has to be one of the most popular sites among Mac geeks. Not only does it have a marvelous collection of hints it also has some great forums full of people more than willing to help. I've often found it useful for fixing a problem and have helped my fellow Mac users more than once.<br />Why would you buy a book with exactly the same name written by the site owner? If the book is the same quality as the site then that's got to be one reason.<br />The book is extremely well written with a wry sense of humour that appeals to me a great deal. The hints cover an extremely large range of subjects, not just the operating system and the iLife software but other commonly used packages such as Mozilla, Camino, Entourage and Word. They offer something new to everyone from the beginner to the advanced Mac user. Some are small and simple, others more complex. There is also a huge variation in the level of the hints, some are for the rank beginner, some could only be appreciated by a power user.<br />The structure, starting with a chapter called \\"Designing Your World\\" devoted to startup and basics such as windows and menus, does move from the simple through to the more complex in later chapters, chapters 15 and 16 are devoted to the Terminal and Unix. At first you may find the hints too simple but as you move through the book you will find your level and even in the early chapters you may pick up a trick or two.<br />There are a lot of good hints here, the cover says \\"more than 500\\" and elsewhere the book mentions 540, either number is realistic - sorry, I couldn't do the math. This is a book that will probably grow on you, at first I thought it wasn't worth the money but I picked it up and put it down several times, used a few hints (fixed Mozilla so it uses an external mail program, made a few cosmetic adjustments, added a couple of menulets), lost it for a couple of days in the desk clutter and picked it up again. It seems to fit into a strange niche in computerbooks, it's not a reference, it's not a teaching guide, it's more a book that should hang around and have a dozen or so pages read once a week so you can play with a hint or two and integrate them into your Mac use (or not, as you choose).<br />Finding the hints is no problem, the contents are  long and detailed, the book is well indexed and the breakup of chapters is quite logical. There is some cross referencing of hints though this is perhaps one area that could improve.<br />So I think you'll get our money's worth if you're prepared to let this volume hang around your desk. If you're the sort of person who likes to read a computer book, learn the information then pass it along this book won't suit you.	2003-06-11

This volume does the job quite well, covering the simple stuff quickly and early while devoting a great deal of its 750 pages to topics of more interest to serious users of Apple's new(ish) operating system. It also declares its audience early, the preface devotes a page to explaining the target audience and states it is 'aimed at folks with a more technical bent than the average user--the power user.<br />The Gist<br />Mac OS X In A Nutshell is quite well structured, and organized into into 5 parts. The first is a quick overview of the Macintosh GUI. The second part, \\"System Configuration,\\" is mainly devoted to getting the system running well (covering preferences, networking, the file system and Java). The third section, \\"System and Network Administration,\\" is a good guide to several lower-level tasks, including an excellent chapter on directory services and NetInfo. The fourth is about development, including Apple's IDE \\"Project Builder\\" and CVS. The final part covers the Unix underpinnings of OS X and X Windows. This includes a Unix command reference of over 200 pages.<br />The Good<br />The book is also well written, with light, easily understood prose and some good screen dumps, tables and diagrams to make some of the more complex points easily understood. I appreciate the detailed contents section, good quality index and black chapter tabs at the side of each page for finding the information I need.<br />Everything seems to be covered, though you may sometimes find yourself needing to go elsewhere for more depth, but this is really only to expected in a book that is trying more for breadth across an entire operating system than depth in one particular area.<br />Despite having used and developed on a Mac for over 15 years and OS X since the late beta stage I still found myself discovering something new and useful every few pages in the book.<br />The Bad<br />The section of the book I appreciated least was the Unix Command Reference. 200 pages, most of which are adequately covered by the online man pages or a quick 'command --help'. Not that it isn't useful having this information on paper, and not that this section isn't more complete than the man pages and less error-ridden. It's just that my favourite operating system has a large number of commands that are hard to find by<br />name alone. Online, I tend to rely on apropos to find what I need. Back when you paid a large amount of money for a Unix license they came with hard copy manuals that included a permuted word index of the same top slug that apropos searches, which made them infinitely more useful. O'Reilly could improve the heck out of this book by giving us the same thing for what I felt was otherwise an almost totally wasted 200 pages (though I admit that the combination of the chapter on NetInfo and the command references for nicl and niutil etc. actually have me now understanding and using NetInfo well.)<br />Once again O'Reilly have provided a web page for the book that is mostly marketing material -- though in this case the Errata page is useful. At the bottom of the page they have a number of links to \\"Related O'Reilly Articles\\" but have only listed three by the authors of the book, leaving out, for example, X11 and Open Office on Mac OS X by Wei-Meng Lee and Configuring sendmail On Jaguar by James Duncan Davidson to name two MacDevCenter articles I've found incredibly helpful.<br />Conclusion<br />This book is not quite in the \\"must buy\\" category. If you do want a book to help you with the more technical aspects of OS X or to help you move to OS X from Unix or Windows hacking then this one is worth a serious look. It certainly better covers the technical aspects than OS X Bible and others of that style (such as the 'Missing Manual' or Robin Williams' 'Little Mac OS X Book'.) The only other volume that really compares is'OS X Unleashed' and it has way too much coverage of the simple stuff and the various applications, is not as well structured and has a wordier, less terse and technical style. It's also more expensive and twice the size and weight.	2003-05-21

The last for non-programming computer users was Robin Williams' `The Mac Is Not A Typewriter' which I bought for a number of new Macintosh users. `Google Hacks' by Tara Calishain and Rael Dornfest and published by O'Reilly will appeal to an even wider audience, I can imagine buying this for friends who haven't cottoned on to `net searching at all and friends who complain \\"Google returns too many sites.\\" People who are afraid to code shouldn't be put off by the \\"Hacks\\" in the title: O'Reilly have obviously taken a wider meaning of \\"hack\\" than just a neat piece of code. This book is a marvelous compendium of tips and tricks for Google, ranging from simple ways of getting the search results you want, through using Google's newer services such as phone books and image search, all the way to advanced ways of using scrapers and the Google API.<br />The book demonstrates 100 hacks, of which close to half are useful for everyone -- newbie, programmer and non-programmer alike. The first 35 hacks, in chapters one and two, will educate you about the intricacies of getting the best out of searching both Google's main web catalog and the newer `Special Services and Collections.' This is the part of the book that should be essential reading for Google users -- in the two days I've had this book these have proved invaluable. The rest are for those who are either looking for extremely advanced search tips, increasing their web site's Google page rank, or programming an application to use the Google data -- all topics well covered in this volume.<br />What's Good In This Book<br />To start, it is well written, well laid out with a good contents section, good index, and some appropriate introductory material before getting down to the first hack. Each of the hacks are numbered and a single hack will often cross-reference other hacks that add information relevant to it. The hacks in each chapter nicely add on each other in both complexity and function.<br />The hacks themselves seem to cover every area of Google that you might want. They range from the downright frivolous (there is a chapter \\"Google Pranks and Games\\") to serious ways of improving your search results and excellent examples of good ways to use the Google API.<br />Most of the code fragments are in Perl, and among the hacks are ways of getting the job done without over extensive use of extra modules such as XML Parsers and SOAP::Lite (including a hack that uses regular expressions to parse the XML).<br />What's Bad In This Book<br />It's hard to find anything bad to say, apart from some frustration that a couple of the hacks that interested me used ASP or VB rather than a more portable language.<br />Oh, another minor quibble, the allied web site O'Reilly Hacks Series has been slow and has none of the code in the book or any of the URLs mentioned listed anywhere -- it seems more geared towards marketing the books than helping the readers.	2003-05-20

It looks like this volume is the start of a new series (there is already a second volume) and I wholeheartedly approve.<br />This book is well written, with an interesting world and well developed characters. It is a mix of a military tale with a travel tale, a group of human soldiers travelling across a foreign and barely known world with the odd battle along the way.<br />I was also pleasantly suprised at the way some of the sub-plots either petered out or wandered off in unexpected directions rather than followed familiar old ways.<br />A well written military science fiction novel that grabbed me quickly and kept me reading.	2003-05-20

This 600-page volume is another example. This way of working does have some drawbacks, there is a little repetition of some basic stuff throughout the book, but not enough to truly detract from it.<br />The book, after some expository material, details 11 projects of increasing complexity. They use PHP, MySQL, PEAR::DB, Smarty and PHPLib. The target audience, according to the book jacket, are programmers who already have a good knowledge of PHP, SQL Databases and XML. Frankly, I think they overdo the amount of experience you need to use and benefit from this book. If you are on top of all those topics well enough to consider yourself \\"professional\\" then this book may be too simple. If, on the other hand, you are, like me, conversant with PHP and SQL but would like to take yourself up to \\"professional\\" use of technologies like XML, templating and WAP enabling then this book will be good.<br />The book is stuffed full of code examples -- and while you can download them in a ZIP file of over 3Mb you shouldn't think of this book as a \\"cookbook\\" as such. It shows various methods for performing most of the tasks you need to build solid backend web site systems to deal with a large variety of data. The projects cover importing and exporting of XML, messaging systems, forums, content management, using templates for both HTML and WML, search facilities and both simple and complex content management among other topics.<br />One thing I did appreciate about this book is how much they left out. No coverage of PHP fundamentals, SQL fundamentals and simple stuff like web forms might be covered once, at most. I certainly didn't need another book on my shelves explaining the basics.<br />My largest criticism of this book is one shared by too many modern titles for computer programmers; there is too much explanation and too much repetition. The section on SQL is the perfect example. Most projects contain some tables describing each database table, a diagram of the relationships and then the full SQL required to build them, their indices and some example data. For their proposed target audience this is way too much information, and as it is safe to assume that everyone who buys this book has a decent `net connection, why put a printout of SQL available online in a PHP book? I could have easily written the SQL myself and having it in the book doesn't make it much easier and since it was available online it was a total waste of space.<br />I also have to take exception to, an (admittedly short) chapter devoted to installing and configuring PostNuke. It gives you no more information on this simple task than the online documentation. As someone who has installed PostNuke a couple of times and never needed any assistance beyond the readme files (and the first was long before I considered myself a good PHP programmer) I felt this was a complete waste of space and not \\"web development\\" at all.<br />My final criticism is once again shared by too many modern titles, there isn't really enough discussion of the design decisions and complications. There are enough code examples and walk throughs to satisfy anyone, but not enough key design decisions are discussed at all, with only a few short examinations of any real design problems. I would have appreciated some walk throughs of such things as code that was too slow, problems with race conditions, methods for mixing static and generated parts of a site and all the real world stuff that intrudes when your site gets slashdotted and that code that was so neat with a hundred visitors a day becomes a thousand. Then show how the code they provide is better, avoids the problems and how to get my code to the same state. Since this book is \\"professional\\" a little more real world, please.	2003-04-22

Edited by Roz Kaveney we have a number of essays on various aspects of the Buffy-verse ranging from Kaveney's own piece, a well written but simple essay on the themes and structures of the TV series, through to more academic subjects such as \\"Vampire Dialectics - knowledge, institutions and labour\\".<br />All the essays are well written, though some might be a little too academic in tone for some. Not all, however, are excellent criticisms of Buffy, becoming more academic erudtion using Buffy as an excuse to peddle a line.<br />Taken as a whole this volume is worth the money, while not excellent it deserves a place as a collection of essays devoted to an interesting TV series and a part of modern culture.	2003-04-22
US	46891942	R7LWHAGWJYNGP	1861007736	387364447	Professional Apache Tomcat	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Another good book from Wrox	Once again I find myself reviewing a Wrox book in a field with little competition. This may well explain the few flaws I found, Wrox seem capable of getting a book into print while other publishers still only have titles on the drawing board.<br />This book goes over eveything (and I mean everything) you need to know to administer a Tomcat server. Don't let the 'Apache' in the title confuse you - it refers to the fact that Tomcat is an Apache project, not that either the book or Tomcat require using the Apache webserver (though I'd recommend it, it is after all the best webserver available.)<br />This book has more authors than any other I've ever read, and unfortunately it shows a little. While the style is generally quite good - informative and readable - there were a few chapters that required a little more careful reading. Perhaps some tighter editing for style in the future, guys.<br />The authors cover configuring and running Tomcat on a variety of platforms in a variety of ways in exceptional detail, taking you through the configuring and running step by step explaining all the background as they go. At the same time they don't waste time trying to teach you how to write Java applications, sevlets or JavaBeans (doing those topics justice requires a separate volume each); just how to make sure your server can handle them, how to install them, administer them and how to make sure they are secure.<br />I liked the book. It is more up to date and covers more of the configuration than the book by James Goodwill. The occasional typo and the style differences make it only four stars, but that may well be the price we pay for a timely volume in a fast moving industry.	2002-10-22
US	46891942	RZK6QZPQVFWRM	1861007221	412073725	Professional Apache 2.0	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Some small flaws but overall a great entry in small field	Books on Apache version 2 are still thin on the ground so finding this was a blessing.<br />Wainwright has written a good book that starts with the absolute basics and covers almost everything you will need to know about running an Apache 2.0 web server, including building, installing, configuring and fine tuning. He also takes care to point out the differences between 1.3.x and 2.0 versions and gives you details on the changes between versions - not just between 1.3 and 2.0 but also the differences in 1.3 sub versions.<br />The sections on security and fine tuning are invaluable, well written and chock full of extremely good advice - ignore this stuff at your peril.<br />There are some typographic errors, but not many for such a large volume. Some might also find the style dense - some sections deserve reading twice - but this is more that Peter is trying to get so much information in than any real deficiency in his writing. <br />There are enought examples to make the text understandable without padding the volume out unnecessarily, though a couple of the most annoying typo's were in examples.<br />It is certainly better than Kabir's 'Apache Server 2 Bible' which does not really cover enough for real world Apache administrator's. I would recommend this book to all Apache administrator's. Even if you don't have a 2.0 server in production (I currently don't) you will find the book essential for starting the testing and migrating. At the moment I'm working on some software in PHP, Perl and Java and I'm finding this book extremely useful as I run 2.0 on a test installation.<br />I give it only four stars as the information you require is sometimes a little scattered - not badly so but enough that I noticed it when first using the book to configure an Apache 2 server. If you are configuring one from scratch without much knowledge then you might not even notice as this book is laid out in a fairly logical order for that.	2002-05-24

This is a nice, well written overview of some of the cultural idiosyncracies of 18th century England. It covers most of the essential subjects such as currency, inheritance laws and customs and the different sorts of horse drawn carriage.<br />On some subjects it can be a little inaccurate, particularly for the later part of the time period, but for most people they will learn a lot about the time. I now keep it close and reread a section every now and then (I still find it hard to remember exactly what a barouche is.)<br />I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys 18th century literature and wants to understand more about the time.	2002-05-19

For a self-taught programmer such as myself it is a hard road with few lights for the path.<br />Certainly &quot;Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;dragon book&quot;) is far too complex for the beginner. You need something else first.<br />Kaplan has made a good effort, certainly for the beginner at this art I have found nothing better. While Mak's &quot;Writing Compilers and Interpreter's&quot; is in some ways a better book I don't like that he uses a top down parser, rather than a shift-reduce parser and doesn't explain why. Mak also relies too much on C++ and tackles a problem too large (A Pascal compiler)<br />Kaplan doesn't fall into any of those traps. He explains well all his decisions and uses methods that translate well into almost any language. He also devotes some space to yacc and lex - essential for those of us who want something a little easier than building the entire thing from the ground up. This book does, however, travel a little fast for some. The main failing is that Kaplan chooses a problem (manipulating images) where too much time is spent on things specific to the language and the end tool is not that useful to a lot of people. He also gets too complex too quickly.<br />This book will reward you with some effort on your part. I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to learn how best to define and build a small language who is prepared to do some work understanding the concepts.	2002-05-19
US	46891942	R3FGYQUYUX0H8R	0140434151	569473707	Emma (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	32	42	N	N	A witty, enjoyable read for everyone.	Jane Austen said of Emma Woodhouse (in a letter) that she had written a novel with a heroine \\"whom no one would like but myself\\". Indeed the first sentence (another sterling first sentence by Austen. How does she do it?) paints a picture that is easily understood as a spoilt little rich girl:<br />\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever and rich, with a comfortable house and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\\"<br />At the same time we have to disagree with Miss Austen. Readers have fallen in love with Emma (both novel and heroine) since the novel was published, and with good reason<br />Ronald Blythe states in his introduction to the 1966 Penguin Classics edition of \\"Emma\\" that it is \\"the climax of Jane Austen's genius and the Parthenon of fiction.\\" I do not dispute it for a second. This novel is my favourite work from my favourite author.<br />The book has a plot so timeless than even translating it to modern day Hollywood and casting Alicia Silverstone in the lead still gets you a hit movie, Clueless. OK, it's obvious from the first chapter who is destined to marry Emma but our dashing hero, Mr Knightley, is still the only person who ever criticises Emma, indeed he spends a large part of his time in the novel telling either Emma or her friends about her flaws.<br />Austen wrote to her niece Anna (writing a novel at the time) that \\"Three or four families in a country village is the very thing to work on\\" and stayed close to this for most of her own works. Yet at the same time, in a letter to her brother Edward (another incipient novelist) she played down her concerns as \\"the little bit (two inches wide) of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush, as to produce little effect, after much labour.\\" 'Emma' is certainly the novel on the smallest piece of ivory with the finest brush, yet it pokes as much fun and wields as savage a knife on thesocial conventions of Austen's England as any other novelist of the time.<br />Austen was capable of writing novels with genuine popular appeal at the same time as she flouted the conventions of fiction. 'Emma' is a marvellous example, an easily read, enjoyable novel with a heroine who is in charge of her own destiny and who marries for no other reason than she loves a good, strong man.<br />Everyone deserves to read a novel this good. Just because teenage girls will adore this novel and swoon over Mr Knightley doesn't mean the rest of us should be stopped from this marvellous read. I enjoy Austen immensely and this is my favourite. I probably read it once or twice a year.<br />When you come to choosing the edition I once again find myself recommending the Penguin Classics edition for its Introduction. This time it is Fiona Stafford who does such a good job (though I think the '66 edition Introduction by Ronald Blythe was a fraction better.)	2002-03-08
US	46891942	RR92ZHXUZL367	0140434267	503057596	Pride and Prejudice (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Penguin gives a classic edition of a readable classic novel	I particularly love the opening sentence of this novel -- \\"It is a truth  universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"<br />Indeed this opening sentence has been claimed as the greatest in English literature. It certainly sums up the central concerns of the  main female characters and the tensions of the novel in extremely short order.<br />I wish the same could be said of the closing chapters of the novel, as they are in my opinion one of its major flaws, they tend to drag. The other that always strikes me when I reread this novel is how superior and full of pride seems the novels heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. For indeed the novel is well titled, it is full of characters who display both pride and prejudice.<br />When we first see Darcy, our hero, he is described as a \\"fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien.\\" We also hear he has \\"ten thousand a year\\" -- more than enough to raise the avarice of those that might wish to marry for money. Not enough, however, for Elizabeth who clashes with Darcy who answers his snobbish indifference to her with angry pride.<br />From this point we have a novel that unfolds as Elizabeth and Darcy go through far reaching assessments of themselves and thier social pride and prejudices. Through this they also gain different views of each other, dragging the reader along.<br />Elizabeth Bennet was Austen's favourite of her own heroine's, it is not hard to see why. She is sharp witted, intelligent, reasonable and a thoroughly modern woman. Her attitude to Mr Collins is a perfect example, while he praises her \\"modesty\\" and \\"economy\\" she denies these and at the same time spurns the then middle class ideal of a woman as submissive and domestic. When she tells Lady Catherine that she could certainly marry Darcy as \\"he is a gentleman, and I am a gentleman's daughter\\" she is rejecting her attitude of class through social and family connections.<br /><br />The novel has all of Austen's typical strengths, good characterization, compelling plot, a sharp wit and a wonderful eye for the detail of the life of English rural gentry.  This novel and \\"Emma\\" compete as the favourite among readers (I'm an \\"Emma\\" fan myself) while it competes with \\"Mansfield Park:\\" among critics as her best work.<br />When you're deciding which edition to buy I would recommend the &quot;Penguin Classics&quot; edition for Vivien Jones' excellent introduction (which should be read after the novel unless you already know the entire plot from a previous read or a movie.)	2002-03-07

I do, however, have to admit that she can occasionally miss, and this is one of them.<br />McCaffrey seems to do best when she sticks to the basics of good literature; a strong central character with action allied to that character that develops them in some way. In the Pern series she has, on occasion, strayed from that strength into tales that just move the history of the planet along. This novel could be the worst of them. Compared to such gems as \\"The White Dragon\\", \\"Moreta: Dragon Lady of Pern\\" and \\"Dragonsong\\" I find myself heartily disappointed.<br />\\"Skies\\" has a contrived plot, poor character development and way too much side action to the main plot. The pace is patchy, shoving you along at breakneck speed and then slowing to a crawl in the next chapter. Not one of McCaffrey's <br />Anne, you can do better than this. Even Pern fans could probably miss this one. I'd recommend it only to those who feel compelled to have the complete Pern series.	2002-02-22

We like to think of ourselves as \\"larrikins\\" and a bit of a convict while we maintain our typical lives. We revel in our convict background and those of us who can lay claim to a forebear from the Irish bogs are proud of it. Given half a chance we'll hate the English.<br />You can see it in our myths and heroes. We exalt Gallipolli, a courageous defeat. Glory in the tale of \\"The Man From Snowy River\\", a bit of an outsider but a great horseman. Then there's Ned Kelly. By all accounts the real man was both brutish and arrogant but Australians admire a man who can wrap himself in steel and walk out into a hail of gunfire. It doesn't hurt that he was hung on November 11, years later the same date would end World War I.<br />I think Carey had his tongue firmly in his cheek when he called this novel \\"The True History of the Kelly Gang\\". Instead of delivering us the truth he takes the myth and wraps it in a marvellous cloak of realism.<br />He starts with the language; simple, poorly punctuated and full of grammatical error. Then he shows us hardship and heroism in the young Ned Kelly to provide an excuse, extends it with a mother who thrusts him into the arms of a bushranger to serve an apprenticeship.<br />The rest of the novel keeps it up. Marvellous characterisation, superb use of language and a great plot. Peter Carey can write a brilliant novel and this one deserved the Booker Prize.	2002-02-22

My first NFS installation had security holes you could drive a truck through, fortunately it was two highly paranoid firewalls away from the internet.<br />If you are intent on having an NFS server in your network then you &lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt; need help. Who better to give it to you than the man who has been looking after the Linux NFS and automount code for several years. Zadok certainly knows his stuff.<br />The Craig Hunt Linux Library, the Sybex imprint that publishes this book, is quickly rising in my esteem. This is the second volume I've bought (the other was Auld's \\"Linux Apache Web Server Administration\\") and both have been absolute winners.<br />I most appreciate that it does not waste time with any unnecessary details about Linux or Unix but gets straight down to the topic at hand (in this case a marvellous description of NFS design and workings.) A good way to go since most of the people, myself included, who will buy this book already have a fair amount of Linux knowledge or will buy a volume that can afford the more basic topics more space.<br />Second is that it covers both the server and client side with enough detail. It doesn't talk down to you while at the same time it makes almost no assumptions about your level of NFS knowledge.<br />Third is that while it says \\"Linux\\" in the title, in just the same way that Auld's book on Apache can be used by any Apache owner (and that includes Macintosh OS X), this book is useful for anyone using NFS on a Unix or Unix derivative such as BSD, Solaris or Mac OS X. In fact one of the server and client configurations I performed with the help of this book was on my personal Mac OS X box. That doesn't deny that there are minor differences in some implementations, particularly with automount and status software but in my experience they have been minor.<br />If you intend to run NFS on a serverthen this book should be sitting beside the computer as you carefully check the configuration. I recommend this book to everyone, a \\"must buy.\\"	2002-02-13
US	46891942	R8BLU63JA0MIA	0672317842	387194651	PHP and MySQL Web Development	Books	4	14	14	N	N	Well written introduction to two vital products	PHP and MySQL are probably the most pervasive add-ons to Apache web servers across the web. Certainly they are both easy to acquire and common on a large range of web hosting systems, including several extremely low cost ones. They also fit together extremely well.<br />This book demonstrates how well. It starts out with a quick course in PHP (OK, 160 pages is hardly quick but it seems to move along at a good pace), follows it up with a brief look at MySQL before a short digression on E-commerce leads into building authentication and secure systems with the two tools (a marvellous place to start when you're thinking about commercial-grade web systems.)<br />After some more advanced PHP the book then goes on to give marvellous examples of web applications, a shopping cart, content management system, email service, mailing list manager and web forums. Finally it has a good chapter on generating PDF files using PHP.<br />Overall the book is well written, well structured and can take someone with some programming knowledge and no experience with PHP and MySQL all the way to the development of full scale database backed web applications.<br />That's not to say that the book doesn't have some shortcomings. You will want to have some program design experience and preferably some experience with database design as these are given short shrift. The book also lacks examples and discussion of some of the less database intensive parts of PHP and some of the more obscure taks you may need to perform. However it does provide an excellent introduction to these two products for someone, like myself, who already has some experience. It must also be added that there are some typographical errors in some of the code examples, not too many and not too serious but in this day and age why can't authors cut and paste from running and debugged code, Kernighan and Plauger managed it more than twenty years ago in \\"Software Tools.\\"<br />I would recommend purchasing this book and \\"PHP Developer's Cookbook\\" for the perfect PHP bookshelf. If you wish a fuller understanding of MySQL and database design then add \\"MySQL\\" by Paul DuBois and Michael Widenius.<br />I rate it as four stars rather than five, only because it is not perfect and so many others have given it five.	2002-02-12

A small bunch of guys in out of the way Canberra, Australia develop a product that emulates a Windows Server Message Block (SMB) server. They do such a good job that within a couple of years they have sponsors assisting programmers around the world in bringing out a product that does a better job than anything Microsoft offers.<br />I've installed Samba in a number of different environments and used it both as a server and client. I wish I'd had this book. It does a good job of explaining how to set it all up, get it running and maintain it. Nothing else does as good a job. While you can (probably) install and run Samba using just the online manuals you will find it a lot easier if you buy this book. It certainly saves me a lot of time.<br />It is well written, easy to read, thorough and well paced. It contains a large number of examples and goes through the almost monolithic smb.conf file till it feels like an old friend.<br />While it does cover some of the underlying network protocols it does not unnecessarily dwell on them, it is a good mix of explanation and getting your hands dirty examples.<br />The book is well structured, starting with simple configurations and proceeding through to complex ones involving printers, domain controllers and the like. A marvelous way to learn, at the same time it is easy to find particular snippets of information when you require them. I find Appendices C (a configuration option quick reference) and D (a summary of the command line options for the daemons) and the fault tree in Chapter 9 particularly useful. <br />I would recommend this book to everyone who wishes to integrate Samba into a Windows environment, regardless if it is a small home network or an entire office building. And yes, you can download the entire text for free - the Samba team have now adopted it as part of the official documentation thanks to the authors and O'Reilly, but call me old fashioned, I likehaving the paper.	2002-02-12

(Sorry, was I gushing.) Robin spends a great deal of time explaining the inner workings of your computer in very readable, informative way.<br />Always a good book the rewrite for Mac OS X has just added to its appeal - I've been using a Mac for more than ten years, OS X for more than 6 months and Robin taught me several things about my Mac and the new OS.<br />If you often find yourself recommending the Mac to friends (and I know I do) buy them a copy of this book the moment you hear about their new purchase. It will save them many headaches, ease their path into &quot;The Macintosh Way&quot; and you'll get a lot less phone calls.	2002-02-06

This is for good reason, these tools can easily become security holes and it is much easier to keep one tool well maintinaed and secure than a number.<br />SSH gives improved security, both at login and of the data transmitted between computers. SSH offers both security and privacy, rare things online today. It allows secure communications between computers. SSH allows users to authenticate themselves to remote hosts. After authentication, users can securely execute commands on a remote machine. SSH fills in for the security deficiencies that are inherent in earlier methods.<BR> <BR>SSH was developed in response to the vulnerability to attack in earlier remote login and control methods. Some of these vulnerabilities include password and protocol sniffing, spoofing, eavesdropping and connection hijacking. Simply, it is the protocol of choice for secure communications between two computers across internet connections.<br />Administering and running SSH can be a pain. As the book points out it is a simple concept with complex parts. It took me a good three or four hours for my first connection to a remote computer and another two to get SSH logins working on my computer. This book was an excellent assist throughout.<br />It covers the three varieties of SSH (SSH 1, SSH2 and Open SSH), giving the differences and benefits of the versions.  The book also shows how SSH can be used to secure other protocols, such as POP, SMTP, IMAP, and others.<br />It also gives detailed explanations of what SSH secures against and, perhaps more importantly, what it doesn't secure against. It explains the key technology and how you can integrate your SSH connections into a Public Key Infrastructure.<br />I also found the Troubleshooting and Quick Reference sections extremely useful, worth the price of the book on their own.<br />It does all this ina straight forward and well written manner, covering all the details without treating you like a dummy. The book is extremely well structured and formatted, introducing topics in a methodical way.<br />I had no need for the sections on various ports of SSH to Windows or the Macintosh prior to OS X, but they read well and seem to cover the topic as well as the other sections. So far I've used SSH assisted this book to connect between my Macintosh running OS X and a Linux host, between a Linux computer and a Linux host and a Linux computer and my OS X Macintosh running as host. While their were minor problems with each of these they were quickly sorted out using the information and troubleshooting sections of this book.<br />In conclusion, SSH is not a simple topic and this book covers it superbly. I would recommmend it to anyone using or administering SSH. It's one flaw is that it can be a little heavy and hard to understand, though not overly so. I have therefore given it only four stars.	2001-12-17

After this thorough grounding it goes on to file sharing using NFS, Samba and netatalk and printer sharing. Once you've covered these sections you can connect to your Linux server from other Unix boxes, Windows or a Macintosh, indeed using this book I set up a Linux server to act as a bridge between Macs, Windows 95 and NT servers and two Sun workstations.<br />It then covers remote login, either using shell protocols telnet or ssh, or X logins using VNC or X Server. Finally it has two chapters on IP masquerading and firewalls.<br />OK, go over that list again - every aspect of building an intranet is covered.<br />Having used this book extensively I've found its flaw. When everything works this book is great. Once you run into problems it is less useful. The large amount of ground covered means that Smith has glossed over likely problems and solutions. Troubleshooting is ignored almost entirely.<br />I would recommend this book as a good beginners guide to building an intranet around Linux to almost everyone with the caveat that you may need more specific information in some areas when you run into serious trouble. If nothing else it is marvellous inspiration.	2001-12-17

They entranced me so much that I went out and bought this title.<br />Kenner expounds the merits of travelling and meeting people as a way of both learning and shaping your life and work. He starts by looking at the \\"Grand Tour\\", the visits to Europe by the English (and later North Americans, including Kenner's father) and links in Homer and \\"The Odyssey\\", Aristotle, Gibbon, Wordsworth, Milton and Dante before moving on to his own trips Elsewhere when he visited first Ezra Pound and then T.S. Eliot. These allow Kenner to tie in Yeats, James Joyce, Henry James and many others.<br />Kenner shows how all these writers were influenced and educated by their own voyages and exiles and how the movement of people shaped modern literature, among others.<br />The book is marvellously written and incredibly engaging. It sent me delving into my shelves and visiting libraries to find poems or prose by the authors he mentions. It once again focused my mind on my own desire to see England and Europe.<br />I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys literature or wants a marvellous excuse to travel and find their own Elsewhere Community.	2001-12-17

Most parents will recognise almost every one from their childhood, though perhaps under a different name.<br />You may discover, as I did, that none of the varieties not already played by my daughter were picked up be her and her friends. It seemed they were attached to the games that had been handed down in the playground through countless numbers of schoolchildren. I discovered one version of freeze tag at my daughter's school had been played in the same way, with the same rules, safe spots and exclusion zones, for more than twenty five years.<br />My one complaint is that some of the explanations of games are a little short and not that many popular varieties of each are covered. A book with a little more depth might have been reviewed at five stars, otherwise a marvellous little gem.	2001-11-16

My daughter and I have enjoyed making several of these paper airplanes together, starting from when she was six. Having multiple copies of the brightly coloured tear out pages for each model means that she and I can both make the same plane - important when guiding small children through the more complicated parts of some of the models. Now my daughter is nine she can build the models herself with only a little assistance.<br />Each of the models we have built has been easy enough to build, looked attractive, flown well and the heavy paper model has lasted for some time. These elements mean that the book covers all the bases as far as I'm concerned.<br />The models are simple, but this is at least part of the attraction of both paper airplanes and this book. Quick to build and fun to fly. I've tried more complicated paper building projects and if it takes more than a few minutes and too much assembly of pieces most small children are not interested.<br />My daughter and I seem to go through a fad each summer of spending a day or two building and flying planes - with a hundred to make we will be at it for a while yet and will be continuing to enjoy this book.	2001-11-15

Read the poem, it is stronger and the `Man' more mythic in Paterson's verse. You may also recognise \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" a poem later set to music that narrowly missed becoming Australia's anthem, certainly more Australians know the words to Waltzing Matilda than our official anthem, `Advance Australia Fair.'<br />Yet Paterson is more than this. The comedic \\"Mulga Bill's Bicycle' is perhaps as well known to Australians. The tale of the proud and arrogant Mulga Bill who claims \\"none can ride like me\\" and \\"I'll ride this here two-wheeled concern right straight away at sight.\\" rolls on in an inevitable but rollicking and funny way.<br />His `Clancy of the Overflow' perfectly captures the Australian mood of living in the city yet eternally drawn to our wide brown land. It's final paragraph sums it superbly.<br />  And I somehow rather fancy that I'd like to change with Clancy,<BR>  Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come and go,<BR>  While he faced the round eternal of the cash-book and the journal --<BR>  But I doubt he'd suit the office, Clancy, of The Overflow.<br />I always enjoy reading his verse. It is easily read, quite short and many of them marvelously humourous.<br />To conclude Paterson is a strongly and uniquely Australian poetic voice. This collection has the best of his verse. I'd recommend it to all who have ever enjoyed one of his verses and to all who might enjoy some simply constructed but strongly evocative Australian poetry. Even fairly young readers would enjoy a lot of the poems in this collection.	2001-10-21

He gives us a small volume full of poems that should surely last as well as his prose. While some of them are strongly flavoured by the time and place where he wrote them others are more universal in their subject and tone.<br />As you read this volume you will almost certainly come across something you recognise, if  it isn't the line \\"James James Morrison Morrison Weatherby George Dupree\\" that catches your memory then it might be \\"Just a bit of butter for the royal slice of bread.\\" If not, then you will find many of them sticking when you have read them to a child.<br />I have seen editions of this volume without the illustrations by E.H. Shepard, it would seem to me a travesty to separate the two. Shepard has always been the traditional illustrator of Milne and the pen and ink drawings he made for the first edition of this book, retained in this (and most) paperback edition are marvellous - well executed and suiting the style and subject of the poems.<br />It is hard to overstate the joy my daughter and I have had from this volume. My mother read many of these poems to me thirty five (and more) years ago, over the past few years my daughter and I have discovered our own favourites. Now she is old enough that she reads them herself.<br />The poems are indeed a little sentimental, a little whimsical and seem to come from a softer, more pastoral childhood than has perhaps existed for many years. I don't see this as a problem for the poetry, after all, if we cannot recreate a gentler time for our children perhaps we can soften the one we can provide with the tiny charming tales in these poems.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone with a small child. I give it only four stars as the poemsare mixed in quality.	2001-10-20

This dictionary is the one that gets used the most.<br />For many years I swore by the earlier edition and this new one improves it with a newer selection of words and the thumb indexes for each letter making it a little quicker to find the word you need. <br />For a student of lexicography this dictionary is unmistakably an Oxford while moving towards a more modern world. While the pronunciation is the good old southern received from the original OED they have moved to the International Phonetic Alphabet from the one developed for the first OED. The layout and typeface for entries are still the same; easily read and well laid out. They keep the same marvelous information regarding derivation of a word but replace a definitive date for earliest use with a symbol that places it in the first second or final third of a century, probably more honest anyway. Like the earlier Shorter Oxford most entries also have usage examples for the word, many offer a usage for each sense of the headword.<br />While the word choice among the 100,000 or so headwords in these two volumes has some holes they are not large at all and mostly confined to more particular areas that border on jargon or industry specific terms. Like some other reviewers I can bemoan the absence of words in my particular topics of interest but there is no point, almost all people will never notice their absence.<br />For most of the English speaking world this is the dictionary that all high school and university students should own, the perfect answer for most of us who cannot afford or house the definitive Oxford English Dictionary.  OK, it may be fairly costly but a dictionary this good is purchased once a lifetime and one this large will not be lost at school or be left at the bus stop.My family has had an earlier edition for thirty years. <br />Argument can perhaps be made that within the US, with its more Elizabethan spelling, a home grown dictionary such as Webster's should perhaps be recommended, since the Shorter Oxford lists US spellings and notes where they are the prevalent US spelling I would disagree.<br />I would recommend this dictionary to everyone who speaks the English language. Every home deserves a copy of this dictionary.	2001-10-20

We were both disappointed.<br />The science seems not that good, the experiments not well explained, the book poorly laid out and neither of us liked the illustrations.<br />I was after a book that had a similar quality to the material available at San Francisco's Exploratorium's web site - good diagrams, good scientific explanations, simple experiments.

The painting seems almost perfect for Dickens novel.<br />But on to the novel itself. \\"Great Expectations\\" was the first of Dickens' novels that I read and I had to read several more before I found another I liked anywhere near as much. It is a small work compared to \\"David Copperfield\\" and his other massive English comic novels. It is a much darker work, too with less of the comedic touch.<br />Dickens published and/or edited several magazines and some of his novels were first written as serials to bolster flagging circulation, \\"Great Expectations\\" is one and it shows. The novel grabs you fast and has a story with many surprises and twists along the way. The one drawback to the earlier serializaztion is that the book probably has too many small climaxes and cliffhangers<br />Like many of the other great novels of the 18th and 19th century a modern reader may well find it a little too full of long descriptive passages. I personally feel that it travels along fast enough that you won't notice.<br />I feel a word or two may be necessary about coincidence in the novel, certainly some other reviewers here at Amazon have felt there was too much. The first thing that should be said is that Dickens readers would not have criticised the coincidence, at the time they had a much firmer belief in \\"fate\\" and would have felt that the coincidence showed how much of Pip's tale was fated to be. The other thing worth mentioning is that the coincidence is no less than one can find in quite a lot of modern television if you just explain the plot. We need to ask if the number of coincidences seems unnatural within the book and if the book works. My answer would be that this tale runs along at a fine pace, well written and well worth the read. The coincidence does not detract from the novel.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, classic read. As one of Dickens shorter works it is also a fine place to start.	2001-10-18

It covers earlier in the learning curve and has much better prose than Kabir's \\"Apache Server Administrator's Handbook\\" and covers more than Laurie's \\"Apache: The Definitive Guide\\". While the sections on Perl, PHP and CGI are not extensive they cover all an Apache administrator needs to know to support the programming efforts of others. I found the sections on troubleshooting and security particularly useful. <br />I had already compiled Apache from source a number of times so cannot really tell how useful this section might be to the newcomer but it seems to cover everything you need to know to custom build your own httpd binary from source.<br />The section on configuring Apache is marvellous, I learn something from it every time I open it to assist in reconfiguring a server.<br />This book is well written, up to date, concise and authoratitive. It has good examples, good explanations and leaves out almost nothing.  Everything a computer book should be. I feel that anyone who is starting down the Apache road should buy this book, any real need for earlier information is adequately addressed by the Apache manual while no other volume covers so much of the rest you need to know as well.	2001-10-18

I was particularly taken with his version of some classis Irish fairy tales.<br />This volume, with over a hundred of his poems, eight plays, around a dozen excerpts of autobiographical writing, a similar number of critical writings and half a dozen pieces of prose, covers a marvellous gamut of this mans work in around 600 pages. It is a good size to carry around with you.<br />The choices taken are good, all my favourite poems and plays are here, my only regret is that none of his fairy tales are here.<br />I would recommend this volume to anyone who enjoys Yeats poetry and/or plays and wants a good selection of his work in many fields. It is also the perfect introduction to his work for someone you know who might enjoy this marvellous poet.	2001-10-18

Often, of course, the code I end up with bears little resemblance to the cookbook code but it saves me time. They also provide a large number of examples of how to perform real world tasks with a language which I find an easier way of learning a language than some dry textbook with short snippets of example code.<br />In the 24 sections this book covers a huge range of tasks, from the simple, such as string manipulation, through to the highly complex such as drawing graphics with GD and outputting XML.<br />Each section is broken down into a number (the average is about 8 or 9) problems, each problem comes with at least one solution and a discussion. The discussion will often mention other avenues of approach for variations of the original problem as well as detailing the various parts of the solution.<br />This book is extremely well structured, well written and useful. I would recommend it for anyone already using PHP or intending to do so in the future.	2001-10-18

Fortunately Apache modules are a little easier to write than Sendmail configurations and this book makes it easier still. <br />Let's not mince words. Perl scripts and other CGI software can quickly become performance bottlenecks on any server, no matter the size of your hardware. The most powerful way of fixing this is to fold a fair amount of that programming inside the server where the overhead of loading interpreters, libraries and code is already taken care of, not to mention you find yourself with much more power and control over the dialogue between server and browser.<br />Unfortunately writing to an API as large and complex as that in Apache is not always easy. MacEachern and Stein go to a great deal of trouble and exert a fair degree of skill in breaking the learning down into manageable chunks and explaining it all with a large number of examples.<br />This was the first book I read that really made me understand the process going on, both between the two pieces of software and inside Apache, when a page is requested. From there the book goes on to give you a marvellous understanding of how to write a module in Perl that fits into that process. Finally the last three chapters are excellent API reference guides, one on the Perl API and two on the C API, and an excellent index (which indexes every function in the API's as well as key concepts) make this a superb tool when you get down to writing.<br />The book does not cover using C in any where near as much depth, but the vital conceptual understanding required and explained in the Perl chapters means that once you have written a module in Perl I don't believe you will find it a problem to do it in C. I have to say though, as a C programmer I am yet to do it, I get so much performance out of a module in Perl I've yet to find the need.<br />I read this book before starting my first module and I have now written three. I would never have even contemplated the task before reading this volume. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a full understanding of writing software for the web and anyone who wants a quantum leap in the performance of their web software. You will need some fair Perl skills and preferably written a few CGI scripts as this book does not cover the language skills required at all.	2001-10-18

I purchased it as one of a number  of books for a friend. This edition has an attractive cover and a solid construction, important for a volume that will be kept and re-read many times.<br />Yeats is listed as editor of this volume but I feel that probably underplays his importance. The stories are not his invention, but it seems his writing throughout. The stories are well chosen to cover a large part of Irish myth and are well written. This volume and \\"Mythologies\\" show Yeats abiding love for the Celtic heritage that surrounded him.<br />I always enjoy Yeat's writing, from his poetry all the wy to his essays. This volume shows that he can have a masterful touch for myths.<br />The only shortcoming is that to the modern reader the language may sometimes appear slightly archaic or stilted, though this is rare and somehow seems to fit for a collection of legends.	2001-10-18

The love of Yeats for Maud Gonne is one of the defining characteristics of his life and the passion he felt for her powered some of his strongest poems. Reading these letters you get a marvellous feel for the strength of the woman and her respect and love for the poet, despite turning down many marriage proposals.<br />Maud Gonne was much more than the woman beloved of Yeats, she was also a political activist, a woman convinced of the need for Irish nationalism and prepared to work for the benefit of the Irish people. This comes through in her letters to Yeats through her mention of meetings and rallies.<br />I can almost forgive her destruction of almost all the letters she received from Yeats, which explains the one sided nature of this volume, almost all the letters are from Gonne to Yeats with only a few from him to her.<br />This volume is a superb addition to the library of anyone who enjoys Yeats. It is also gives a remarkable understanding of Maud Gonne, a major element in the Irish history of the early 20th century. It loses a star because of the shortage of Yeats letters.	2001-10-18

Rules such as \\"do just one thing, do it well\\" seem to seep in through the pores as you read and work through this book.<br />It presents a number of projects starting with a word count program and progressing through some filters to some fairly complex tasks culminating in a RatFor pre-processor for Fortran. All the examples are written in RatFor, a version of Fortran that adds some more structured elements to that early language.<br />Don't be put off by the use of RatFor, the language is easily understood and the style of programming so clear that the algorithms are easily understood. I've personally translated a fair number of them to both BASIC and C and the RatFor pre-processor design became the basis for an AppleSoft BASIC pre-processor written by a close friend.<br /> I've relied on this book so much for the last ten years, after writing \\"Hello World\\" I drag it out and translate a couple of the tools into every new language I've learnt. I then spend a day or two thinking about and implementing a design optimised for the new language. After that I find I have a good handle on a language and how to design for it.<br />This volume is not for those who want a book that gives them pre-written tools, a fair number of the tools are standard issue on any Unix derivative and the code is only tersely commented, relying on the exaplanatory text. However I recommend this book to all software designers and programmers because as you work through these examples you will learn a great deal about honing your craft.	2001-10-17

The preface states \\"Our goal in this book is to communicate the UNIX programming philosophy ... throughout runs the themes of combining programs and of using programs to build programs.\\" It delivers on that goal.<br />The book then follows with a series of chapters that start with basic shell commands and then pipes before branching out into shell programming and going on to explore useful Unix tools such as grep, sed, awk, C, the standard libraries, make, yacc and lex through a series of small useful programs culminating in a small calculator language called `hoc' - a useful calculator and easily extensible.<br />While most might feel that grep, sed, awk and shell programming have been replaced by tools such as Perl and Python these early chapters provide a good grounding in Unix programming and remind newer users of the power and usefulness of these simple Unix tools.<br />Briefly covered in a final chapter are some of the document preparation tools based on troff - the macro packages ms, mm and of course the man package used for Unix man pages along with tbl and eqn for tables and mathematical equations respectively.<br />In totality it provides an excellent grounding in writing good, workable software for Unix. The writing is clear and concise, the volume well laid out, the examples are in the main useful, though a few rely on multiple users of the one machine, not as common now that Linux and Sun have made a Unix computer more of a desktop machine than a minicomputer.<br />This is a classic book and I would recommend it to all starting out Unix programming, regardless of your experience with other operating systems. Ignore it's age, computer books are rarely this good and almost never this timeless.	2001-10-17

As you learn the craft you need to learn the wisdom of those that have gone before you. This book becomes essential.<br />It spells out, first with a counter example found in a piece of code published elsewhere and then with the code rewritten, over 70 pearls of wisdom that should be engraved into our consciousness; for many years every morning when I logged on to start work as a commercial Unix programmer one of these rules was randomly chosen as my message of the day, if I didn't understand the short rule I dragged out the book and refreshed my memory.<br />Brian Kernighan has co-authored three books almost essential to learning our craft, this volume, \\"Software Tools\\" and \\"The Unix Programming Environment\\". \\"Elements of Programming Style\\" spells out the fundamental rules, \\"Software Tools\\" shows you how to apply them to a number of simple projects and extends the rules to software design and finally \\"The Unix Programming Environment\\" shows you how to use them in an operating system designed to reward you for your effort.<br />The examples in either PL/I or Fortran expound the simple rules clearly and expertly in a manner typical of Kernighan's writing. That the languages used are old and most of the rules long accepted lore are not a drawback to this volume. Anyone who knows C, Pascal or even Perl should easily understand the code and programmers turn out code just as bad today in any number of languages.<br />These things make this book highly recommended reading for anyone who wishes to call them self \\"programmer.\\" A final word of warning, don't lend this book to anyone, you'll never get it back - I've bought four copies so far.	2001-10-13

A large system of configuration commands and syntax is a useful and powerful tool for allowing people to easily control complex pieces of computer software.<br />Large configuration files have one major problem; you tend not to look at them often enough to get the language and syntax down pat. You find yourself making too many tiny errors in command name or syntax and struggle with one window editing the file and one or more windows open displaying the documentation. <br />With Apache I have this problem in spades. The configuration system may be well designed and the syntax as easy as possible, but most people will still struggle to keep every detail in their head. I know what I need to do, have a fair idea how to do it, but the details elude me.<br />That's where this little volume comes in immensely handy. I have several of O'Reilly's pocket references and find the PHP, Apache and Perl ones never stray far from my computer. This one provides a wealth of reference information packed into a small, inexpensive little volume.  It has enough information about the exact name and sytax of the Apache configuration directives that I dont need to go to a larger book or delve into the manual.<br />Oh, and for those that want this volume to lay flat. I ran my copy through a paper cutter and trimmed the spine off. After punching holes in the pages I then had a loose leaf version that allowed me to add my own pages of notes in various spots and lays perfectly flat. It only took a few minutes. Sorry, O'Reilly - but it is more useful if it can lay flat and being able to add notes is great.	2001-10-10

It includes a CD-ROM with over 10,000 lines of Perl code that give you a large number of complete scripts and some useful subroutines. The book gives line by line explanations of all of this code.<br />I've used both snippets of code and complete CGI programs from this book as starting points for my own work many times. More than enough times to justify the cost of the book. Once you've worked through a few of the more complex examples you should improve your understanding of Perl and CGI enormously, I certainly did.<br />Some reviewers have mentioned that they thought the scripts were difficult to install or not enough effort was given to explaining the install process. I felt the opposite, I had little problem in getting the scripts to work and the problems I did have tended top be because of my lack of total understanding of CGI, web servers and Perl, solving them was an education in itself.<br />There is also a web site with corrected (yes, there are some typos and bugs) and upgraded copies of the examples and an email list for installing and modifying the examples, an excellent resource on top of the book. I would recommend this book to almost everyone.	2001-10-09

After a few years of pleasure he was replaced by someone else who (among other things) wrote on the joys of Rubik's cube and I found myself wasting weeks of time and filling notebooks with my quest to explore and solve the cube.<br />That columnist was Douglas Hofstadter, who brought the same skill at sharing his enthusiam for his topic that created the amazing, mind shattering 'Godel, Escher, Bach'. His column, that occupied the same place as &quot;Mathemetical Games&quot;, was called &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; (looking closely at those two names will tell you a lot about Douglas Hofstadter) and lasted for 13 issues.<br />This book is a compilation of those columns, each with a new endnote by Hofstadter and some letters received by the magazine and his reply.<br />Together they cover a large range of topics while keeping to the central concerns of most of Hofstadter's work; consciousness, patterns, music, language and computer systems.<br />The combination works superbly. This volume is much more easily approached than 'Godel, Escher, Bach' while raising similar questions in the mind of the reader. For those that have read the earlier work there is not just the joy of more of Hofstadter's writing on diverse topics but the sheer pleasure of discovering another dialogue involving Achilles and the Tortoise.<br />I find it hard to define the set of people who would enjoy this book, but it would be a large and varied one.	2001-10-05

Brave, handsome and a skilled seaman he is almost without flaw - a tendency to seasickness and constant self doubt are the two that make him human.<br />This novel gives us the early maritime life of Hornblower, though not the first written, and we are introduced to a seasick, slightly miserable young man as he starts a naval career that will end many years (and novels) later with him reaching the pinnacles of the British Navy.<br />The historical background of the Napoleonic wars throughout this and most of the other Hornblower novels is well played out and made me want to delve back into the history books to follow up on some of the slighter historical allusions. The same skill is brought to bear on all elements of life, struggle, battle and death in the British Navy of the time.<br />I first read all these novels as an adult and enjoyed them. My nephew in his early teens, not a big reader, devoured the entire series in short order after I gave him this volume. We both wanted more and continue an unsuccesful search for another author of seafaring adventures who combines excellent writing, fine detail and constant action with the same skill as Forester.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone from their early teens on who enjoys a good adventure story.	2001-10-05

Every child deserves a copy of this poem and this would be the edition I'd recommend.	2001-10-03

While it is not as easy to understand as some poetry writers such as Donne and Marvell are quite approachable with a little effort and aid from Gardner's excellent introduction and footnotes.<br />The poets represented here cover a good selection of this Elizabethan style. (Elizabeth herself is represented by a verse). Gardner has wisely chosen the poets and their poems. Have this volume if only to read the verse of Donne and Marvell, heck, if only to read \\"The Sonne Rising\\" and \\"To My Coy Mistress\\". Certainly this would be an excellent place to start in a study of the metaphysical poets.	2001-10-03

Eliot is a major figure in 20th century literature for criticism, publishing and poetry. On the critical front he is known for his rediscovery of the Metaphysical poets Donne and Marvell, his collections of essays The Sacred Wood and The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism; as a publisher he was a director of Faber and built up a stable of modern poets such as Auden and Ezra Pound.<br />It is, however, for his poetry that he will surely last and this collection gives a marvelous selection of his works. The first poem in this collection The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock is a masterwork with superb imagery and a marvelous sense of humour and irony as it gives us the words of a man who seems much older than Eliot must have been when he wrote it, it was first published while he was in his twenties.<br />While some of his poetry seems to miss the mark as too dense and perhaps overly constructed others have rich layers of imagery and allusion that reward a little effort and rereading with a sense of large and vivid meaning and depth. The Waste Land, one of Eliots most famous poems and responsible, along with other poems of the period such as The Hollow Men, in giving Eliot a reputation as one of the disillusioned modern poets. Eliot denied this, saying he gave the illusion of being disillusioned. The Wasteland is four hundred lines long and is quite enigmatic, some scholars have said that it may have been less enigmatic before Ezra Pound helped and convinced Eliot to cut it back from an original 800 lines.<br />The last major work in this volume is The Four Quartets. It is impossible in a short review to summarise the brilliance of these works. Written in the late thirties they are a masterful summation of the concerns of Eliots earlier works and a culmination of his examination of his own personal Christianity.<br />Between these three peaks are many works almost their equal. Sweeney Agonistes, Ash Wednesday, The Hollow Men, and excerpts from the The Rock among them.<br />To conclude this collection is a wonderful summary of the poetic works of one of the major literary figures of the twentieth century. For a complete overview of Eliot you should read at least one of his plays (Murder In The Cathedral is my favourite) and one of his volumes of critical essays such as the two mentioned earlier. I would recommend this volume to anyone who enjoys poetry, particularly those who enjoy reading poetry over and over again.	2001-10-03

This was the first of his books to take some of the ideas from the many columns and present them in volume format.<br />I first came across it in a British edition titled &quot;Mathematical Puzzles and Diversions&quot; in my early teens. From memory it took me around three weeks and two rolls of adding machine tape to finish with the hexaflexagons (don't ask, just buy the book) in the first chapter.<br />Mr Gardner deserves his reputation as a writer who can simplify complex subjects without talking down to the audience and this is well demonstrated in this volume. Some of the later chapters deal with parts of probability and game theory that skirt around some complex maths while someone with little mathematical ability (such as myself) finds it easy to follow along. The prose is light and easily read while the subject matter is entertaining.<br />I would recommend this book for someone mathematically inclined in their early teens or anyone in their mid teens or later. If you have a child capable of mathematical and/or logical thought who is getting turned off mathematics by the rigors and dullness of school then this volume may well turn the trick - I know it was influential in convincing me that it was my schooling and not my mind that had ruined my maths ability. I give it only four stars as it is now starting to show its age, otherwise it would have five.	2001-02-01

I've known Cherry my entire life and she has sent me a copy of all of her books.<br />Cherry is best known for her fantasy works, particularly the excellent &quot;Rulers of Hylor&quot; trilogy ('A Princess of The Chamelyn', 'Yorath The Wolf' and 'The Summer's King') that I consider her best work (but currently out of print.) One of the reasons I enjoy this short story collection is that it showcases both her literate and exceptionally readable style and her ability to write across the entire spectrum from fantasy to hard science fiction.<br />All the stories are readable with several standouts. A book I'd recommend to anyone who enjoys Sci Fi/Fantasy.	2001-02-01

Yeats Vol. III: Autobiographies	Books	5	11	12	N	N	A joy to read and marvellous background	The more I have learnt about Yeats and his life the more approachable and enjoyable I have found his poetry. <br />I bought this book for a close friend and fellow lover of Yeats poetry and read it after she did. Yeats writes about his life and philosophy with the same skill and breadth he brings to his poetry. I found the notes added for this edition both useful and interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Yeats, his philosophy, life and poetry.	2001-01-25
