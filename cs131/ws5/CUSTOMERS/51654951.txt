Ok, fiction is suppose to go out on a limb occasionally and I can accept that.  But when you're dealing with the government in a hostage situation, I seriously doubt that they might look the other way.  However, as far as romance and suspense goes this book is a 5 star story.  Meg's young daughter and grandmother have been taken by terrorists.  They want her to kill a rival terrorist if she wants to see her family again.  Meg will do anything for her family and that includes killing someone.  Enter Navy Seal John Nilsson.  John has been in love with Meg for a long time but couldn't have her.

This is a book you simply can not put down.  Every chapter has something happening and not just words to fill in the pages like most novels.  Everything ties in together and makes sense.

Right from the start Kelly knows something fishy is going on.  She gets the help from sexy cop Nick McBride who also has a lot of unanswered questions.

Coulter has a way of getting you close to her characters.  Lindsey was raised by a horrible father.  Always treating her like an outcast and constantly putting her down and abusing her verbally.

She becomes Eden a famous model and meets the man of her dreams.  And now someone is out to kill her.  Is it her Father, who was disinherited by his mother and gave Lindsey/Eden all the fortune, is it her old professor from college who is a crazy, is it her sister, or her sister's husband, or is it someone else who wants her dead.

There's a lot of twists and turns that keep you breathless and a subplot about a skeleton of a girl who has been dead for years.  The only complaint I had with this book, is that it could have been shorter and still had the same impact.  It felt like Coulter was just trying to use more pages to make a story.

I have been a fan of Ms Coulter for many years so I was excited when I  bought The Edge.  She reintroduced previous characters from her other books  &quot;The Maze&quot; (excellent 5 star book) and &quot;the Target( an  excellent 5 star book).  I thought WOW I love these characters.  But Ms  Coulter tried a different style of writing this time.  She wrote in the  first person of Mac ( a man) So ok I can handle this.  Ms. Coulter still  showed the charming wit that made her so well liked.  The story is going  strong and then you have only 5 or 6 pages left and your wondering how is  this going to end and tie up all the different stories.  The problem it  didn't address what happened to all the characters involved in the plot.   You finish reading this book and the first thing I said was what about so  and so. Maybe Ms. Coulter is writing a sequel to this book to answer all  the questions....	2000-08-23

In this book, the whole story revolves  around 1 night in a convience store.  Which is very odd for Brown.   However, she makes it work somehow.  Two teenagers fall in love and run  away from the girl's multimillionaire father.  You see she is pregnant and  her father won't allow her to keep it.  Deciding to run away to Mexico,  they need cash fast so they decide to rob a convience store.  In the store  is a star reporter who would do anything for a story, a rancher known as  &quot;Doc&quot;, a older couple on their honeymoon, a couple of Mexicans  who are scary, and a loud mouth clerk.  Before the teenagers could take off  with their loot, the girl goes into labor and the police and FBI are  waiting outside.  It's a life and death situation.  The rancher  &quot;doc&quot; and the reporter help the young couple deliver their baby  and calm the couple from doing anything that might harm anyone.  The  reporter discovers that there are more important things than the big story  and the rancher learns a thing or two.  Read the story to find out the  explosive ending.
