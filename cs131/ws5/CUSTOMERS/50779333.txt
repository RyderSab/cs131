US	50779333	R11UKZ93ZCD9HR	0446365335	70482357	The Wives of Bowie Stone	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Outstanding	This book was amazing.  Maggie Osborne definitely has a way with words.  She takes two rather unlikeable characters at the beginning and makes you love them at the end.  There were several places in this book that made me cry and just as many that had me laughing out loud.  Rosie was an incredible herione and her turn around was truly believable.  Highly recommended!	2002-11-14
US	50779333	R34EVA3MBB07NQ	0440225566	548124654	A Heart Full of Miracles	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Outstanding!	This is a fantastic book.  I was crying and laughing at the same time.  Seth and Abby are devasted when Seth's sister dies.  Seth is a doctor who feels he should have been able to save his own sister.  Depressed, he decides to leave town and quit his profession.  Abby has always loved Seth and doesn't intend to let him walk out of her life.  She does some interesting (and desperate) things to keep him in town all in the name of love.  Then Abby finds out that she is sick and it looks like only Seth will be able to save her. <br />This book is really funny.  Between Abby's crazy family and her attempts to keep Seth from leaving I was laughing all the time.  When Abby gets sick though is when the book really shines, the emotions are very real.  I highly recommend this book!	2001-06-03
US	50779333	R39CSIY3YAK1BT	044022554X	41377087	A Kiss to Dream On	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Tiresome	This book was good but not as good as some of Stephanie Mittman's other works.  The main characters become annoying.  They refuse to communitcate with each other, leading to a string of misconceptions that almost tear them apart.  There was plenty other things in the story that could have brough tension to the relationship (He steps in at the last minute to marry his best friends girl to save her from the embarrassment of being left at the alter and being pregnant).  Most of the tension however is brought on by themselves.  They have very low self-esteem and therefore never believes the other when they get a compliment.  Instead its &quot;He/she must have meant this instead...&quot;.  The ending of the book is good and there are some funny moments but overall I found it tiresome.  For a better Mittman book try A Heart Full of Miracles.	2001-06-03
US	50779333	R2LPTA04BS9QSY	0061092827	899591236	Shades of Grace	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Good book!	Shades of Grace tells the story of a woman battling with Alzheimer's disease.  It shows a lot of her point of view, the first times that she notices something is wrong, the panic in not remembering where are you or what you are doing.  It also shows how her family is affected.  <br />Overall it is very good.  The facts and feelings about the disease seem to be very accurate.  Recommended!	2001-05-21
US	50779333	RHA33ZFCZ81N3	0446356077	579226449	Nightrose	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Fabulous!	This is another great book by Dorothy Garlock!  From the minute Rowe meets Katy he knows that they were meant to be together.  Katy however distrusts all men and will not even consider the idea of marrying.  <br />The story follows Rowe's (sometimes hilarious) attempts to court Katy.  As in all great Garlock books, there are several interesting side stories, including one involving Katy's sister and niece.  Definitly recommended!	2001-05-13
US	50779333	RUKJAV3P788LQ	0440221811	988239440	The Courtship	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Starts out slow but...	This book started really slow, several times I wondered if I should just put it on my bookshelf.  Happily, I did not because it really picked up in the middle and was a wonderful story filled with romance, humor, and a little bit of mystery.  <br />Charlotte is a wonderful heroine, strong and willing to fight for a cause.  Ash is the perfect suitor (even if he is courting his brother's wife).  I just wish that Cabot (the husband) was more likable.  It was obvious from the beginning that Charlotte would be better off with her brother-in-law than with her own husband.  <br />Overall it was a great book.  If you decide to give it a try be patient!  Get through the first 100 pages and you will be glad that you did.	2001-05-12
US	50779333	RKS86PN8DO82Z	0671027662	292635793	Coast Road: A Novel	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Very good!	This is the first book I have read by Barbara Delinsky but it definitly will not be the last.  <br />The story follows the lives of a family brought together by a tragic accident.  Rachel is left in a coma.  Her ex-husband (Jack) must come care for their two daughters.  As the days pass Jack learns a lot about Rachel and why their marriage failed.  He realizes how much he has missed his family.  He must then wrestle with the fact that Rachel may never wake up and if she does that she may not want him back. <br />This book touches on some very real issues and does a good job of conveying the emotions of the characters.  It is slow in some places but does move along (especially considering one of the main characters is in a coma).  I hope Barabara Deliniski's other novels are as good as this one!	2001-05-07
US	50779333	R3LLBVFZI4FG4T	0446603031	601783769	Annie Lash	Books	2	5	12	N	N	Not good	I love Dorothy Garlock's books but this one just didn't make it with me.  The male character wasn't nice to anyone, especially Annie Lash.  The story was disjointed and at times unbelievable.  Maybe the 1700's just isn't the time period for me although I did like Wild Sweet Wilderness by the same author.	2001-05-03

This one looks at the family dynamics on a small farm in Missouri and the joy one woman brings into an abused family.  <br />This is definitly heavier material than in most Garlock books but well worth it.	2001-04-27
US	50779333	R2RYCTN51QFD1F	0671004565	203276036	We'll Meet Again	Books	3	0	0	N	Y	Fair	The premise of this story is good--murdered husband, wife accused but can't remember the night he was killed. Once Molly (the wife) is released from prison she goes about proving her innocence.  The only problem is that everyone believes she did it even her own lawyer.  Only a highschool friend, Fran, is on her side.  <br />Somewhere in the middle of this book I just lost interest.  It really started to drag.  It took me over two weeks to finish it because I kept putting it down.  Once I got to the ending I was glad that I actuallly finished because it was quite surprising.	2001-04-26
US	50779333	R3GZKDBG9BJE0P	0446365246	356170038	Love and Cherish	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Not outstanding but good...	As a big Dorothy Garlock fan I was not blown-away by this book but it was pretty good.  Out of the books set in the 1700's I would definitly recommend this over Annie Lash.  <br />Sloan saves Cherish from some river thugs and takes her to his home to care for his motherless child.  The child's mother returns and causes major havoc.  Of course the river thugs return to cause some trouble.  Throughout all of this though is Sloan and Cherish and their determination to be together.  There is also good background to the characters from the River series.  <br />If you have never read a Dorothy Garlock book before than I would recommend The Listening Sky or Larkspur.	2001-04-13
US	50779333	R3K9QT79B7JI43	051508901X	861253564	The Gamble	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Simply wonderful	Agatha and Scott find themselves on opposite ends of a bitter fight over prohibition.  As each does their best to outwit the other they find themselves growing closer.  When an orphaned child turns to both of them for comfort, they realize what has been brewing.  Unfortunately, what has brought Gussie and Scott together (prohibition) may force them apart.  <br />This is a fantastic book that I have read again and again.  Both characters are really likeable and there are many funny scenes.  This is a great book for new and old Spencer fans.  If you read Hummingbird and liked it, you will enjoy The Gamble.	2001-04-08

Dr. Susan Chandler finds herself in the midst of a murder mystery when she invites an author to be interviewed on her daily radio show.  Soon potential witnesses are being killed and the closer Susan comes to putting the final peices of the puzzle together, the more her life becomes endangered.  <br />I didn't know until the end the book who the real murderer was.  Every time I thought I had it figured out, something would happen to point the finger at someone else.  There are also intersting sub-plots involving Susan's family and their problems regarding the recent divorce of her parents and an old rivalry between Susan and her sister, Dee.  <br />I have read many of Mary Higgins Clark's books.  You Belong To Me may not be her best work but it was definitely very good.	2001-04-01
US	50779333	RUO8IUDJL7WS2	0446605883	340749165	With Song (Heart Series)	Books	5	4	5	N	Y	Second in the series	With Song is the second in the series about the 1930's.  While I was not crazy about &quot;With Hope&quot; I fell in love with &quot;With Song&quot;.<br />Molly is eager to catch the two gunmen who killed her parents.  She agrees to let Hod, a government agent, use her as bait to lure the outlaws back to the store.  At first, Molly doesn't like Hod at all, he is gruff and at times, insulting.  As they prepare for the gunmen to return for Molly, she begins to see another side of him and gradually falls in love. After losing her parents so violently, she is hesitant to open herself up to more hurt.<br />Once again, the secondary characters in this novel are outstanding.  Molly's aunt, her best friend, and the sinister preacher help to bring the story along.  Johnny Henry also makes an appearance and we learn how Henry Ann is doing.<br />I highly recommend this book.  It is truly romantic and it is nice to see characters stuggle to with their feelings instead of just instantly falling in love.	2001-03-24
US	50779333	R2Q8S0MG39RZSL	0440173922	72276304	The Ring	Books	5	9	11	N	N	Truly outstanding	This is a wonderful book.  We follow Arianna through her life in Germany, losing her mother, than father and brother, and finding love with a German soldier.  When he is killed, she has no one to turn to.  Alone and afraid she heads to America where she discovers that she is pregnant.  She is befriended by a family in New York, who invite her into their home and their lives.  She is quickly betrayed by them and once again finds herself alone, this time with a baby to care for and protect.  <br />This is my favorite Steel book.  I cried through whole chapters ( a good sign for me).  Stongly recommended.	2001-03-22
US	50779333	RH3OX18FRHBH7	0446365254	672421828	This Loving Land	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Interesting read	This was one of the first books I read by Dorothy Garlock.  It was an interesting book but not as good as many I have since read.  The main male character, Slater, is not likeable.  He has a very bad temper.  At times the plot was confusing and I was not crazy about the subplot involving a ranch foreman.  <br />Since I gave this book three stars there must be something I found enjoyable about it.  Overall the writing was very good and I enjoyed the ending which had a surprising twist.  <br />I have read almost all of Dorothy Garlock's other books since picking this one up and many are simply fantastic.  I would encourage you to read this book but also look into other Garlock books.	2001-03-22
US	50779333	R1GUT8GVSDUE6J	0446602523	988567472	The Listening Sky	Books	5	16	17	N	Y	My favorite	Out of all the Dorothy Garlock books I have read this is by far my favorite.  Jane Love heads west, hopeing to out run a secret that has haunted her all her life.  When she gets to her new home she discovers two things, that she was lured west to basically be a mail order bride, and that some who knows her secret has followed her.  She naturally takes her hostility out on the town's manager, TC Kilkenny.  <br />Hostility turns into admiration as Jane gets to know TC and eventually love blooms.  As their feelings grow, Jane is terrorized by the growing hatred her tormentor shows and the fear that TC will not be able to look beyond her past.  <br />There are several interesting subplots in this book.  One involves Colin Tallman (from &quot;Yesteryear&quot;) and his determination to win the love of Sunday, a woman who came west with Jane.  It is interesting to hear the fates of Rain, Amy, John, and Addie.<br />This book has it all: humor, mystery, historical references, and of course, romance.  I highly recommend it to both long time Garlock fans and first time readers.	2001-03-22

My mother, gradnmother, and I would eagerly pass the new books around.  No more...I didn't finish this book and discourage my mother and grandmother from even starting it.  I felt nothing for the characters, not even pity.  If you want to read a truly outstanding Danielle Steel book try The Ring or Remembrance.	2001-03-21

Johnny Henry and Kathleen must overcome their own misgivings and issues surrounding their backgrounds and the death of their baby.  A strange character that is fixated on Kathleen only adds to drama.  <br />The characters in this book are very real.  There were several times that I wished I could snap some common sense into Johnny Henry and get these two together.<br />This was a great ending to the war series.  For anyone who has read &quot;With Hope&quot;, &quot;With Song&quot; and especially &quot;With Love&quot; this is a must read.	2001-03-21

Tom and Henry Ann were likeable characters but I was bothered by his cheating on his sick wife.  I know divorce was uncommon in that time period but the woman obviously needed some medical attention.  <br />The secondary characters really made the book shine.  Especially Johnny Henry who appears in the other books.  There was a bit of suspense which is common in Garlock novels and that kept me reading at a fast pace.  <br />I would recommend this book and highly recommend the two that follow.	2001-03-21

Lorna comes from a very wealthy family, Jens works at their summer home.  He dreams of building boats and soon convinces Lorna's father that he can build a boat that will beat all others at the annual race.  During the summer the Lorna and Jens fall in love.  When Lorna returns home she discovers that she is pregnant and her parents forbid her from seeing Jens again. What follows is heartbreaking. The characters in this book are very well written and the ending is emotional.  I highly recommend it.	2001-03-18
